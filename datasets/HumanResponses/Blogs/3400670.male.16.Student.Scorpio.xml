      Hey Thomas - we missed you...we had an interesting discussion on the atomic bomb...the pushing of sugar is very interesting...comparable to the big companies making money off adolescents at Skyview - disguised as Vending Machines and Food Products....  Mr. Ray wants to be invited to our US History Blog - and I have the list of sixth period students.

       Just some interesting things to note from Henretta about WWII Rationing:  "People found it especially hard to cut back on sugar.....the manufacturers of products such as Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum received unlimited quantities fo sugar by convincing the government tha their products helped the morale of the men and women in the armed forces". Woooooooo we are really really a nation addicted to sugar.  But what's more interesting: "Congress imposed a nationwide speed limit of 35 miles per hour...as a result, highway death rates dropped dramatically." WOW!!!!! Speed limit NATIONWIDE at 35 mph.......Man in today's lightning pace stressful lives......Such a speed limit would certainly kill off lots of people!!!!!!!!!!

       Unfortunately, Ms.Clark, I will be gone all day tomorrow (for MUN) and on Friday (for NWSE), and both days are apparently discussion days. But hopefully you or some other students can post interesting discussion topics here to keep me and others who will be absent informed.   I do believe that there are lessons to be learned in history so to avoid similar conflicts, patterns, and cycles of violences (otherwise there is no point in enthusiastically studying history). Things do occur in similar way just because of natural ways of human interactions, reactions, and emotions.   And that the dropping of the atomic bomb poses an interesting question and potential debate. I personally don't have a strong opinion of that right now simply because it's such a complex issue.   Oh yeah, and don't forget to invite all the talkative sixth period students to this discussion blog!

      Hey - very interesting tidbits...Thomas thank you for starting the AP Blog - American foreign policy is very complex - I wonder what would have happened if American intervened in the Spanish American War - would World War II erupted earlier - would Hitler's Final Solution been avoided or defeated before the horrible consequences.  It is so easy to make or critique our past and qualify it as a mistake.  I have never really understood the quote..."we must remember our past so we aren't condemned to repeat it ."  We will never be able to repeat the past...it is so different...however we continue to behave as humans do? How can we repeat something that is so different - or do we repeat the same instances with superior technology.     "Under God" - did you know they added that phrase in the 50s during the cold war?  America's rally around Freedom...Goodness and Godliness...Cold War propaganda?   I enjoyed reading your blogs - What are your thoughts on America's decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Prediction: On the fifty year anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education (1954) - Portland will host a major racial riot....Topic "TALK"  See you tommorow

         Isn't it a sad state that the Fascist National forces won the Spanish Civil War? The Loyalists, being the Republican-elected govt., get supported by only Mexico and the USSR, while the US, Britain, and France keep their sympathies at home. I applaud those who went over to aid the Loyalists. I have yet to read much lit on this period (Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is now on my shelf, unread, but certainly on deck). George Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the "villanous" form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam. Anywho, and the lack of help from democracies causes the Republican collapse, and Franco's brutal reign goes from 1939-1975; 36 years! Gee, and the policies of neutrality and appeasement certainly didn't help in Spain, or in Czechoslovakia for that matter. Or in Poland, etc. "It just goes on and on and on."    Does anyone need an extra id partner. I'm trying to get an exchange going for this new test. Anywho, see you all later, hopefully. I'd like to see what you think on this above blurb. Didn't the quote before signing into this thing say "for people who have lots to say"? Goodbye all. Adios and God bless you.                                                             Yeehawman,                                                               (Tristan)

      Nicely written, Thomas. I don't understand why some people find that they must make a big stink about a two word phrase. If they don't want to say it, then they shouldn't say it. That's why the first amendment is there. It protects freedom of speech, and the freedom of not-speech. So if you don't want to say something, you're welcome to not say it. Don't start suing people because you don't want your kid to say it. I agree that little kids should know about the pledge, but forcing them to say something they don't know the meaning to is not right. If you want people to say the pledge, at least have the decency to teach them what it means first.

      To deviate only a little away from wars and genocide,  urlLink Mr.Wargo's class blog has got up there the really controversial debate of the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance, and especially the "Under God" phrase.  And don't blame me for spilling over that debate to this blog, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations.  As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the "Under God" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about.....  What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards.   And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear.  What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the "majority" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good).   Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber.   And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists.   And as always, I welcome all dissagreements, criticisms, opinions and would like to debate this issue with others.  Differences of opinions is good!  Thomas Chen

      It's been too long since I posted in a Blog. I even had to create a new account, because my last one was unused for so long. Anyway, Today was interesting. I knew that the old cartoons were about wartime stuff. So many of them showed people buying warbonds, or ditching the drafting, or something to do with war, but cartoon Hitler was still funny...

      Heh Interesting AP Exam Data for AP U.S. History: Last year's AP Exam statistics: Average Score 2.73, (compared to 2.78 for World History (which Emerson's class nailed the exam), and 2.69 for Comparative Politics/Government).  Response to matt: Hmmmmmm wait, maybe not many people are interested, but then there are those few who are really interested, and for them, it's a chance for them to burst their feelings out........

      Very insightful comments...I wish more students would take the time to think about what they learned - you did a nice job synthesizing the information and taking it to formulate your viewpoints on the time period. Nice procees - and you allowed me to see it which makes it more fun.  I hope others are wrestling with the information to help them support their understanding of the world.  That is the best way to go about learning history - there is no way you can remember everything but the more information you acquire will help you formulate your own viewpoints.  It is called epistimology...(Look it up)  You did it perfectly - I am not sure I spelled it correctly.     Kailie - I am glad you loved Sam's lecture.  I hope you see his generetional view points - Change over time...I am not sure Sam's view points change - (women, Communism, Freedom, America)  but they are fun to examine as he continues to teach history.    Sunday   Segment 1 - 1800-1846 Republican Revolution to the Election of Polk Segment 2 - 1846 to the Civil War Segment 3 - Reconstruction/ The Guilded Age  If you guys can continue to reveiw your multiple choice while going through the study guide it should help.   We also have Tues, Wed, Thursday to sharpen our saw.    Keep working and thinking - make connections.   Clark

      Well, I'd like to do anything but that essay.  I think we've had enough Centuries to do well on the test, but I'd like to finish the series later.  Cause like Kolk said, Peter Jennings is one sexy hunk of man.  I'd like to tear into him like Sam and his Sheila (that's Aussie for "girl").  Just kidding about all that, but I really enjoyed Sam's lecture today.  He's very intelligent, understands what went on and why, and can relay it to a bunch of high-school kids very effectively which is tough to do.  I think the key is boot camp and that drill instructor that's itching to get out... keeps us on our toes.  The lecture really effected my views about the time period.  It drives me crazy that the era that produced The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Who and Miss Clark would also deem it noble to spit on a soldier who risked his life fighting for freedom.  That may sound distorted/cliche (even to the vets), but the troops were there because the government told them to be...the government that feared the domino effect, and that if Asia went down to communism, trade ceases, America chokes on its own success in a ridiculous recession no military might could pull us out of, then the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWII, and every other conflict we've participated in under the banner of freedom and democracy would have all been for nought.  It is so prevalent to Iraq... Bush riding terrorism to attack a country that could foster terror... but it makes me think "what about Saudi Arabia?"  like, 4/6 or something of the 9/11 bombers were  Saudi.  And what about Palestinian groups like Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyr Brigade?  Are they not also equally important to the war on terror, despite the fact they are attacking Israeli Jews rather than American ones?  Sam's lecture also helped shape my political views.  Kerry fought in Vietnam, won a silver star for valor as he captained a boat in the hottest of zones in the heart of Vietnam, Bush skipped out on the National Guard.  Although military experience does not ensure quality presidency (Grant), Eisenhower seems to have done a job well done.  I also get the impression that being surrounded by death, Kerry might be more hesitant to send in troops, he might carry a higher appreciation for the life of a soldier.  I was going to ask Sam about it, but we ran out of time.    Give me your thoughts on Nam, communism, Sam, or political oppinionism.  Good luck on the test, and good luck to SJClark in Seattle!  Love, Rob

      Well, Clark, I just have to say i LOVED Sam's lecture today, and im really not being sarcastic either! I think I'm really starting to feel the pressure of the test coming up, but i think as long as we continue to have review after school, I'll survive. I will definitely be at school on Sunday from 1-4, but what are we working on? I think the era that i need to work on the most is during the 1800s...pretty much the entire century has become a blur to me. But im feeling confindent about the 1600s and definitely the 1900s, and im starting to understand the 1700s better as we've been talking about it during the review sessions. See you all tomorrow! Oh yeah, and Rob, dont ditch me on Friday morning...i coming to your house at the crack of dawn whether or not youre awake!  Kailie

      Rob - Thanks for the compliment...did I say something funny.  Tomorrow we will move forward through the revolution and constitution and hopefully get the Republian Revolution and the era of good feeling.  I appreciate the feedback.  On friday I have a job interview in Seattle...Not that I have enough to do this week...but I am very excited about the prospect.    Friday - I could give you a multiple choice test again - or an essay prompt - or review - or centuries...Please use your review guide and review the Multiple Choice questions that you missed.   SUNDAY - AP study session 1 - 4 THE 1800s...Can people make it at this time?  Monday you guys have the test and the rest of the week we will review...  Essay prompt:   John Winthrop's goal was to create a "City Upon a Hill"?  Like John Winthrop, Jefferson believed Americans had a special destiny and responsibility: "The eyes of the virtuous all over the earth are turned with anxiety upon us as the only depositories of the sacred fire of liberty, and...our falling into anarchy would decide forever the destinies of self government."  This was the Republican vision of the City Upon the Hill. If Americans were to be a virtuous people, would all of the people in the new nation be allowed to become American?  Throughout history how and why have Americans struggled to live up to these principals?   I need a Muchas Gracias Burritto.  Ms. Clark

      Clark- have you thought about a career in standup?  I know you have your administrative internship, but drop it all and head for Hollywood!  Maybe then you could afford to be a principal in Napa.  Thanks a lot for all the reviews- they beat the hell out of Henretta, which is nice because me and him aren't as acquainted as we could be.  Do you think we could start reviewing Jackson through WW1 era?  That seems to be the blankest for me, except for the slavery aspects of it.  Maybe one more essay practice somewhere would be gravy if you could fit it in... maybe a take home one that we could review?  To all my peers- keep on trucking.  The test is coming up fast, but we can study even faster.  GOOD LUCK!  Love, Rob

      Yes...I thank Jessica for those life magazines...one is the year of 72 in picutres..  The other has the cover of the Kennedy family at JFK's funeral and of course my favorite...1969 Neil Armstrong walks on the moon...Guess what the Mercury seven were furious they weren't chosen to be the one who walked on the moon - they picked Neil...He must have had the "RIGHT STUFF" -  By the way I have been so thirsty for a glass of tang.  I will make sure to bring those in...  Those in 6th period I am going to start at 7:00 am on Wednesday because Sam is going to lecture about Vietnam...Boys bring doughnuts and girls bring juice and cups and I will bring coffee...  Also - the mornings of Thursday and Friday I am with Ms. Winters - we are going to go over 6 to 7 American art slides and then do an art project - There was an Andy Warhol question two years ago...she said it was fine if we wanted to review on the balcony or the side room.  Cheers - I am going to the gym.  Clark

      Hey APUSH - we had some great success on our AP multiple choice test - however, I know many of you are disappointed.  The good news we have two weeks to raise those scores. Last year we only had a couple students over 40 at one week prior to the test. It is not time to panic - instead go over twenty multiple choice questions a day - even some that you got right you still need to work on.  Antebellum - Pre-Civil War - this term is often used to refer to the golden age of the south.  Andrew Melon - Treasurer under the Harding administration - you know the roaring twenties were about big business and handsoff government  Evan Cate can give you all the information  Essay Prompts - Most answered the essay - How did the Civil Rights Movements of the 50s and 60s address the failures of reconstruction?  I think you could look at supreme court decisions - Plessy V Ferguson - Brown V Board of Education  Presidential Decisions - Eisenhower sent in troops, Johnson and congress supported to important pieces of legislation while Hays made deals to take the troops out.  Excellent leaders and movements that addressed the issues head on...Desegregating schools, facilities, voter registration drives...all of the issues that the radical republicans wanted for the freedmen but failed to achieve...I think it is also important to think about the television and media.  The movement relied on the sympathy of nonsoutherners...the television allowed for the brutality to be seen and not just told.  All of these are applicable events - Brown V Board, Montgomery Bus Boycott, Little Rock Nine, Jackie Robinson, Desegregation of Military Forces, SNCC, Sit Ins, Freedom Marches, Freedom Rides, CORE, March on Washington, Stokely Carmichael,  Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voters Rights Act of 1965...Remember to use events to support your point and ideas - do not describe the events.  Your readers are intelligent people and describing the Montgomery Bus Boycott is insulting.  How did anti - communism, the silent majority or the women's movement shape American public life....  Most NAILED the anti-communism in the fourties and fifties...you should have established the fear...Soviet Expansion, Eastern Europe, Berlin Blockade, Berlin Airlift, Truman Doctrine, Eisenhower, Korean War, Red China ....  But how did it affect American Life - fear of communism and subversion - McCarhyism, HUAC, Black Lists, Bomb Shelters, NSA, NASA, Space Race, Interstate Highway system, Math and Science stressed in schools, Arms Race, Competitive with Russians...  Silent Majority was a group of "hard-working" middle class Americans who were sick of the protests and the violence of the sixties and seventies...In support of Nixon's back to Normalcy - Good Americans, Anti - Drugs, Back to American Values....Voted in Nixon and led a stance against the chaos and hardships of the sixties and early seventies.  In fact one poll believed only 11% of Americans sided with the kids at Kent State and the rest supported the Natinal Guard.  - this was the hardest one...  Feminist Movement - Betty Friedan - there is more to life for a woman...the birth control pill, protests at Miss American Contests...again a group met the "establishment" head on to make changes in the work force, at colleges, and made it acceptable for women to have a career...prior to the movment - job sector divided...changed the family units two income households and may have contributed to the divorce rates...ERA, Title 9 and Roe versus Wade...are all good things to include.  I promise I won't eat the entire pint of ice cream if you promise not to freak out and do intentional focused studying each night.  Have a good evening.  Steph

      Good Morning...Thomas I think the segregation process is a fascinating story. It appears that all the efforts in the sixties may have been futile because our society is segregated based on economics and race.  Racial and ethnic segregation has been a phenomenon from the beggining of America's story.  The Irish, Chinese, Italians, Koreans, the Russians immigrate and create communities.  It seems like the etnic cultures eventually  "melt" into mainstream society after a generation or two  but people with racial differences haven't.  Then their is the Native American story where they were placed in communities together for convenience and their own preservation.   During the seventies there was a movement to desegregate called "bussing".  You see an example in the Denzel Washington movie Remember the Titans.  It failed miserably.  Now with "No Child Left Behind" legislation allows for students to leave their failing school to attend another.  You tell me - where would all the students from Skyview go if it failed?  It is funny - when I was in school we were deemed "The Nation at Risk"   - Regan administration.  Now it is NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND...  I am getting to ready to read your prompts...I will post some information on how you did as a class.  A good thing to examine to finish your studies of modern time is to take Kennedy - Camelot, Johnson - The Great Society, Nixon - Back to Normalcy,  Carter - ? and Regan administration and make sure you look at what they stood for politically, on domestic and foriegn policies...Watergate, Opec, The Iran Contra Affair, The Camp David Accords, Reganomics, Star Wars...  I am working on a review...

      I feel this is a great article that everybody should read:  urlLink   Segregation no longer black and white New issues fifty years after Brown v. Board decision  It supports some educator's arguments that today's schools are actually as segregated or even more segregated than ever. Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the "standardized" testing scores. This problem really boggles those "No Child Left Behind" testing conformist's mind and is a threat to their "everybody conform to the same standard" ideology.  I would like to hear  everyone's arguments and opinions on this issue.

      Ok, Ms.Clark, I had to delete all of those erroneous testing posts. And by the way, for any of you who may have trouble publishing your posts, after you click "publish blog", please do not hit the back key, for it may erase your post entirely.   In reading Henretta, I found it interesting that today's leisurely clothingstyles largely stemmed from the counterculture radical movements: when young men started to wear "coats and ties and women skirts and sweaters", and "youth defiantly dressed in unisex ragged blue jeans". This provides a great contrast to the clothingstyles of "old days" when even in the 50s everybody was still wearing very uptight clothes and the kids in school had to wear tight uniforms.   And  urlLink here is a link that may bring about some shock about the current cost of war in Iraq. I was surprised and never put into perspective how much money that cost of the war came to be .

      Took a while, but I liked the extra credit movie the other night a lot! I thought that it showed the attitude of the time period pretty well. America was trying so hard to beat Russia in the "space race," and I didn't realize it was that important to a lot of people. I also liked how it showed how much people liked the Kennedy's. I think it was Guss's wife who got totally emotional because she didn't get to meet Jackie.  I have to agree with Ms. Clark that astronauts are totally hott after seeing this movie.  I enjoyed my first extra credit movie night. Thanks! Xoxo,  Jess Knab

      The movie tonight was alright.. it took too long to get going, but maybe that was just me. In response to Ms. Clark's questions...... Perhaps the reason that Cooper couldn't say Yeager, is that at that stage in America, we wanted to see leaders and such on TV, not someone who wants to take his time explaining about some other guy's abilities.  The news people were wanting him to hurry with his explaination, and perhaps it was faster to just say himself. Also, another answer could be, that he was scared that if he didn't show confidence in his own abilities as a pilot, NASA would have chosen the guy he suggested. If the nation sees an astronaut reccommend that he is not the best pilot, they would be upset that he is flying a space craft their tax dollars went into creating; they would want someone who is ready to go into space.   I think that the main point of this film was to show that during the Cold War, personal victories boosted the nation's morale. For a very large portion of the nation, breaking the sound barrier meant nothing or little to them. Yet the media played this off as some great event. While sending 1 person into space was a landmark event for the US, it became more and more dramatized each time... everytime a new astronaut went up, they "pushed the envelope farther than before." But each time they orbited the earth a few more times than before, it was made out to be an enormous event. This surprised me, because if I was living back then, I don't think I'd care if someone went two more times around the Earth than the person before him. I think the directors were trying to show that maybe some events during the Cold War were made out to be bigger than they actually were. I felt that they were successful in this (unless my analysis is wrong). They showed how dramatized these events were....  Wooo Getting kinda late... i should be shuffling off to bed like an hour ago...  ~Mat "Ralph" Keksi signing off

      I enjoyed the movie tonight, although the editors should be shot in the face.  The flick portrayed the Cold War attitude- the fun side of it.  Frank and I were talking about how fun it would be to have that kind of competition with another nation... where every American triumph feels like a personal victory.  Aside from the brief period of time after 9/11, I don't think I've ever felt the sort of American comradery and patriotism that appeared in The Right stuff.  The homage paid to the test pilot was a little time consuming, but touching to see Yager continue to risk his life because it was his job and what he liked to do even if it were overshadowed by the space race.  Lastly, seeing Jeff Goldblum, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, the crazy guy from Vertical Limit, and the hick in Tremors  as such young guys was also fun.  I hope that the extra credit incentive for posting tonight begins a trend on this blog.  Also, respond to the posts Tom and I wrote earlier.  Love Rob  P.S.  Thanks for the excelent review this afternoon, Clark

      In response to the question about gender roles, I believe that the movie's portrayal of the responsibilities of women during that era was quite accurate.  Throughout the movie the wives of the to be astronauts were depicted as obedient to their husbands even if this was not in compliance with their personal feelings.  The prime example of such characterization was demonstrated in the scene where the astronauts were being interviewed by the press and the question arose of how the astronaut's wives felt about their husbands going into space.  In response, all the astronauts replied that their spouses supported them 100% in their pursuit towards space, when this clearly was not the case for all of the wives.  Finally, one aspect of the film that stemmed away from the stereo typical gender roles was the relationship between Alan Sheppard and his wife.  When urged by his superiors to tell his wife to speak with the press/vice-president, Sheppard disregards this pressure, and supports the wishes of his wife to be sheltered from the invasion of the press/media.  Any other thoughts?  Benjamin

      After you comment on Robs and Toms blogs please consider writing or discussing the following ideas - or come up with your own.  Write an informative and entertaining review of the movie.  Read a few current movie reviews before you write your review on The Right Stuff.   At the end of the movie when Gordo Cooper is asked, “Who was the best pilot you ever saw?”  Why couldn’t he talk about Yeager?  He tried and it was on the tip of his tongue, but it never came out.  Why?     What was the theme of this film? What were the film makers trying to tell us?  Were they successful?     How does the film depict gender issues?  How does it support what you know about the fifties and the early sixties?  Were you suprised by anything in the movie?

      Hello? (HELLO, Hello, hello) Echo! (ECHO, Echo, echo)  I don't think there's anybody in here, Tom.  But just in case... if you're in 6th period, or the other AP period, I hope you remember the Holocaust/Hiroshima discussions we had.  I came across a story in the New York Times about a village in Italy attempting to prosecute some former Nazi SS members.  If this piques your interest, you can read the story here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th .  The question it asks is, is the world ready to forgive the Nazis?  Because Sant'Anna Italy isn't ready to forget it.  Post your thoughts about this, the draft, or your mother's snickerdoodle recipe, but say SOMETHING!  Love, Rob

      Ok, with the approval of Ms.Clark, I would like to ask everyone your opinions on the impending possibility of a draft.   Here is a  urlLink great article that introduces a glimpse of the growing probability of a draft    I didn't know that our country has 1.44 MILLION TROOPS stationed in 141 countries. Why would we want to police the whole world?  And given the result of the past few days, the miserable situations our armed forces got into in Iraq, the situation seems somewhat scary. And I know it's inevitable, but Rumsfeld's decision to keep the soldiers there for 90-120 days more is an act that would further degrade the morale of the army, after already almost all of the frontline soldiers have been put on suicide watch.   And here is an article from CNN that accounts for the Bi-Partisan support in congress for the draft   CHARLES RANGEL   Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet   Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home.   To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the "citizen soldier" ideal that has served our nation so well.  As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices.   CHARLES MOSKOS   Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee   Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer—precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls.   We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps—and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories   JAMES INHOFE   Republican Senator from Oklahoma   I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country.   I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.

       Lol yeah fear of communism is a very prevalent and integral part of American society, even to this day. Of course it's way too shallow and outright wrong to label people or groups of people in some strict, broad, undefined, and misleading category. Here is what I found to be a brief definition of "Third World Countries":  The term "Third World" was coined in 1952, in the wake of the Second World War, to refer to the ex-colonies that were not part of the two newly emerged geopolitical blocs (Soviets and US) of associated interests. The "Third" then meant the third way . So by that definition, I guess other than the US and USSR, Western european former imperialist nations and Japan won't be considered third world (because they weren't colonies), but almost every other nation could be considered third world. And interestingly enough, the US did not refer to the Soviet bloc and other communist nations as first world either, they sometimes are even categorized as second world.

      So this is the first time that I have posted, but I have seen some of the comments that have been posted and I just hope that we will be able to focus on reviewing for the AP test and not just for the time period that we are studying at the moment. But... actually, I do have a question for chapter 27. Does anyone know why Third World countries are called ''Third World"? I was just curious, so hopefully someone can help.

      Hey APUSH students!  I hope you are studying.  Let's shoot for an extra-credit movie night next Tuesday @6:00...THE RIGHT STUFF...definately one of my favorite movies and books.  Anything by Tom Wolf is great - I am currently rereading some of Halberstom's work on the fifties - he was the historian who did the great Mike Hammer impersonation today.  He is tons of fun to read...he writes pages on Elvis, I Love Lucy and the McDonald's Hamburger chain. I love pop-culture.  As someone asked during class today, Chris Mitchem - why were Americans so scared of communism?  How did this fear start - and how did the Truman and Eisenhower administration handle this fear?  Did the leaders of this time add to the fear and hysteria or attempt to control it? Howard Zinn believes the administrations created this fear to stimulate our economy?  I am not sure I buy his idea...What do you think? Where does Pop-Culture fit into this...Captain America, Mike Hammer - Hollywood was infatuated with the Western at this time? Was Elvis a communist?  James Dean?  Marlon Brando? Lucille Ball had RED hair and married a Cuban????   Blog On... I think this time period could be easily related the roaring twenties...and today - what will this decade be called?

       Tuesdays are Thursdays are good. Just on days when there is NHS (which is only twice), some people may come a few minutes late. But as for now, studying for AP is my top priority, so I will probably suck time out for the history study sessions if I have to. So it's an excellent idea.

      Hey AP Students...I hope you had a good break and are ready to get back to WORK!  The next three weeks will move quickly  - and be somewhat intense.  Jessica your notebooks will be checked on Friday...along with a quiz.  We will be having a quiz every friday...five IDs from your reading.  I need to keep you honest - we have a few weeks until the AP test. The good news - you can choose to do your notebook or not...I will not be taking the time to grade it after this friday.   It would help if you have read and thought about the origin of the Cold War and its impact on America's society for class the next two days.  I also need the song - "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel - for class.  Does anyone or there parents have the Best of Billy Joel?  I may have it at school but I couldn't bring myself to enter the building this week.  I want to have afterschool sessions on Tuesday and Thursday - they may be time to view and discuss the Centuries, Multiple Choice or review certain eras.  How do Tuesdays and Thursdays work for you guys?   See you Monday... Eye of the Tiger...:)  Clark

      Sorry everyone for using this blog for private purposes......but Ms.Clark, I have some emergency requests that just came out today!!!!!!!!!!! It's really urgent in that I was ridiculous chosen today in the Northwest Science Expo to take apart in the annual ISEF (Intel Science and Engineering Fair) (Representing get this: TEAM OREGON!)............And that happens during the second week of May!!!!!! I have to stay in portland the WHOLE WEEK and that week also freakishly coincides with AP Tests!!!!!!!!! So I have AP Chemistry test on Tuesday that I DEFINITELY CANNOT take in the Jim Parsley Center..........I have to either take the AP test DURING ISEF.....Which would require you to mail in the AP registration forms (By bloody this Tuesday), or I have to take it on a makeup day at JPC.......But in any case, the signup for me to take the test on May 10th AP Chem test at JPC is completely void now.  I'm SOOOOOOOOOOO GRAVELY SORRY about this really short notice of this ridiculous inconvenience.  Hopefully you can take notice of this blog post as soon as possible.  Thomas Chen

      Thanks to y'all for including me in your discussion group. Has anyone seen Hiroshima Mon Amour? It's an old film by Alain Resnais that begins with footage from the Hiroshima devastation and ties it to a woman's past experiences in WWII. It's been a while since I've seen it, but it might be a good view as it reveals the impact (pun intended) of the war on both Europeans and the Japanese. It is beautiful in its portrayal of the devastation of war. It's very 'art' and I think subtitled. Massive wonk points.  It has taken me many years to begin to see past the mechanics of history and foreign policy down to impact that this history has on people. In junior and high school, I was an avid student of WWII. I read books like PT-109, Guadalcanal Diary, et. al. made models of WWII airplanes. I even had an amazingly complex board game in which you could replicate almost any battle in the war. It was all VERY geeky in retrospect. I'm sure part of this fascination was due to my mother's experiences in the war as a Finnish refugee and the fact that she and I would watch the BBC documentary World at War. But as a child, the war was fascinating because of the things, places, and 'stuff of war.'   Thomas' comment about the complexity of the issue of dropping the bomb is telling. Up until 9/11, non-combatant Americans never had to deal with the war on their own soil. The WWII experiences among an average European, American, or Hiroshima resident could not be more different. As a child refugee during WWII, my mother often had no food. Some Finns ate the bark off birch trees for nourishment. Her father was killed within the first few weeks of the conflict. As the oldest child, she became an erstatz father at age 12. Sugar was the least of her worries.  I never really appreciated this very real history when I was young. History and war were either subjects of grudging study or something that I read in a book. After travelling, college study, and some sporadic personal growth, I look at history very differently now. I'm not saying that's better or worse, but my reading of history is now reflected through a desire to see it both from 'the big picture' and from the viewpoint of the human beings that are part of it. It makes history far more complex, messy, and ambiguous.  As an example, my mom was 'the enemy' in WWII. When the Finns sided with the Germans in '42 to attempt to regain the land that had been taken when Russia (our ally) invaded Finland, they became part of the Axis Powers. The Finns lost twice in WWII. Because of the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact, they lost their land to the Russians and were forced to pay reparations to the US and other allies for siding with the Nazis. (My mom was very proud that the Finns were the only Axis nation to pay every cent of their 'debt' to the U.S. despite not receiving any of the aid given to Japan or Germany.) Despite the fact that my mother's heritage and former home is more Russian than Finnish, she strongly distrusted and disliked Russians until she developed Alzheimers. Now she loves everyone.

      Hello to all of my homies out in bloggerland.  I don't know if we realize how much time Thomas spends on this blog to make it run smoothly for us.  Next time anyone sees that wonderful little wizard, give him a hug and a kiss for being so damn tight.  Slow week in news, but I went and saw Day After Tomorrow and got thinking about global warming.  The danger is very real- studies have shown that seasonal allergy symptoms get worse every year thanks to global warming.  Steps have been taken to reduce its escalation (at least industrially), most notably through the Kyoto plan or protocol or whatever it's called.  Unfortunately for human kind, many countries that donate significant portion of greenhouse industrial excrement can't afford to change their industrial standards to reduce the CFC's and such that fill the atmosphere.  (Watch me spin this politically) I commend George Dubya for  expelling a hideous dictator out of the goodness of his heart despite the sacrifices of many Americans for purely humanitarian reasons without any nice byproducts that the American economy is STILL waiting for the benefits of... but I regret that the U.S. in all its glory can't aid an ally like, say, Russia modernize its industry which would not only benefit said nation, but the whole world.  Everyone elses thoughts on saving the environment and therefore the world?  Love Rob

      I'm not so sure that people understand what it is to be morally against something. It's not like we have a bible in our hands, knocking on people's doors and preaching to them about their horrible sins. We're not Puritans! That seems to be the stereotype that some may see whenever someone else uses morals as their base of their opinion. Whether it comes to Gay marraige, or abortion, y'all probably know where I stand on those issues... or do you? You see, I don't mind abortion being legal, but I wouldn't use it. Even if I do have an "accident" and get pregnant, however that may work. And it's not like I'm rich and have a lot of money, so I'm priveledged enough that I can say that I can handle having a child. I would be dead broke, dropping out of school, getting a job, compromising with my parents, handling their disappointment... and so on with the negatives of teen pregnancy. AND STILL, I would have the child and either keep it, or give it up for adoption... making sure FOR MYSELF that it goes to two wonderful parents who can give the child opportunities that I wouldn't be able to provide. But you know, all that would go away if only I aborted the child. But (again, using my morals OMG) I wouldn't, I couldn't, I value the life that I created too much. But this is all a hypothetical situation guys, don't worry I'm not pregnant. And I won't get pregnant til I marry, because I have that much control over that situation. But go ahead and keep abortion, because others feel that it's needed. Now was I using a bible to defend my reasons? A lot of people who think to the right don't.  When it comes to the Gay Marraige issue, I'm not homophoebic and I'm not going to shove a bible people's faces, but I don't recognize marraige of homosexuals as the same union as I would a marraige between heterosexuals. It's not the same, and it's not for reasons of what people do in the bedroom. It's much more than that, especially when there are children involved. And Rob, to give you a reason as to why I think it's wrong... it's because I believe that homosexual marraige isn't something that God designed. The design was for a man and a woman to have the marraige of holy matrimony. But to a secularist, I guess that doesn't matter. They don't use morals as the base of their opinion. They have to use facts, reasons and "imperical data" to share their beliefs, and in turn, they're viewed as the "smarter" people. Don't lie. I know the reasons why students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way. It's because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point. And teachers love it... at least most professors at universities do. I've been told that if I need a good grade in a course, I need to write a paper that agrees to the viewpoints of the professor. And they're all pretty much liberal. And don't tell me it's not true, because I've seen it. I would talk on and on and on, but like Rush Limbaugh, I'm running out of time. Yep, I listen to Rush and pretty proud of it. But I do want to say one more thing. It makes me feel bad that some people say I'm intolerant of their views when in reality they are intolerant of my views. I don't hate homosexuals, I just don't agree with them. I don't hate those who choose abortion, I just don't agree with using it. What I'm trying to say is that I want to take down the idea that right-winged, conservatives aren't open people. DOn't believe that stereotype.

      Ok, just in case you have not realized, I've completely changed our AP US History website for the better. There is a "contributing members" section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our APUSH friend's blogging profiles. And I've added three things:  1: tagboard(which is for visitors to post; or you can post short comments and quick questions and answers on some small particular topics - there is a limit to how many words one can post on the tagboard at once), 2: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 3: Comment option for every post. Hey, if you feel somebody's got a very interesting, or hilarious, or horrible post, feel free to write some comments about that peculiar post.   THANKS ALL MY FRIENDS!  Thomas

      ok... i just got back from watching a most excellent movie... The Day After... no, not that new one in the theaters (the day after tomorrow)... the one made in the 80s about nuclear war... some of you probably dont know what i'm talking about... but some (hopefully Ms. Clark) will know... I thought it was a good movie.. and brought up one of my favorite quotes from Einstein: "I don't know how world war 3 will be fought, but i can tell you how world war 4 will be fought; with sticks and stones..." very grim indeed, but a very good movie...

      Ok, i realize i havent been active in any of the blogging going on this week, but i have finally caught myself up and want to respond to some of the ideas you all have presented. I know Ms. Clark is trying to get us to talk about a new issue, but bare with me.   I understand all sides of the different arguments that have been presented, so i commend all of you for putting your ideas out there. I think the arguments that are clearly stuck in my head are Rob's (with the hope of rallying up support for the blond hair blue eyed heterosexual caucasian white males), Natalya's (arguing on both GM and EC) and Megan's. Maybe its because i agree with a lot of what they have said. Unlike Megan, i dont know many homosexuals, however my heart does go out to them. But I do realize that i dont have the same religious background as others that could hinder my sympathy for them. I still am pushing that there is a definite separation between church and state. This should be remembered when arguing whether or not GM should be legalized.   I know i posted a week ago, and it's so far back in the past that im sure it has been forgotten, but i said a lot of what Natalya said, just not as eloquently (she is of course an experienced debater!). I agree completely with her arguments, particularly on the debate over abortion and EC. I know people have moral reasons for not agreeing with its usage, however mistakes happen. It isnt fair to put an innocent child in an unforgiving world. No matter what opportunities are trying to be given to make up for lower-income, hard lives, the pain inside cannot be erased. They are brought into the world unwanted, permanently branded. And i agree, it is up to each individual to make their own decision. Being a fairly independent female, it scares me to death to know that the option may not always be open to me. Accidents happen. I know that i wouldnt want one bad decision to effect me, my unborn child, my family, and the father of the child (considering rape isnt involved). Each decision has repercussions, effecting not only one individual, but all those who surround him/her.   I'll admit it now: I am pro-choice on pretty much every aspect of social controversy. I dont think it is acceptable for a group of individuals, no matter what their backgrounds or personal beliefs may be, to make decisions that effect the masses. There are always instances where people should just have the right to make their own decisions, b/c in the long run, each individual knows what is best for himself/herself.   Addressing the idea of whether or not abortion or gay marriage should be reason to sway one's vote, i think its up to the individual.Unfortunately, i will not be 18 for the coming election and thus i cant say that i can answer the question without a little cynicism, knowing that it doesnt effect me for another 4 years. But i do think that it is worth researching and looking into. I think it's important to research all of the different positions each candidate is taking, economically, their domestic policies, and foreign policies. I dont think it would be wise to make the decision solely on one aspect of their campaigns. Basically, it's choosing the lesser evil. I dont think anyone will ever completely agree with all the prospective policies, but its choosing which one you have lesser opposition to.  Well, i hope i have covered all all the topics that have been discussed over the past week. But bare with me if i havent, a lot of ground was covered between now and the last time i posted!

      I want to make sure everyone understands that Rob is using sarcasm and exaggeration to make a point.  Please read in between the lines when you read Thomas and Rob's Blogs...boys be careful in your writing so you are not misunderstood.  (Yes I am a worry wart, a control freak and high maintenance.   I am curious what you think about Fog or War...I know I hindered second periods viewing... I am fascinated with Robert McNamara...he is brilliant and has learned and willing to share some of his misfortune.  Do you think he is fair to LeMond (spelling)?  or Johnson...neither man is able to defend himself? What point has had the most impact...the proportionality argument was very powerful.  I also enjoy Errol Morris's style...music and some of his effects are interesting while I found a few annoying.  Next week...Get yourself ready!

      Haha Rob, I'm not sure if I understood your last post correctly, but it seems like it was full of metaphors and analogies. First of all, GAAAAA the oxymoron combinations of Leftist/Fascist/SuicideBomber/Know-Nothing political jargons mixed with some of your peculiarly molded mind has transplanted the great picasso like abstarct ideas into our fantastic debate blog. Emerson would laugh so hard.  Secondly, I think you were the first person to mention that gay people are more loving than heterosexuals. "Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher. Marriage is something that this group has to fight for". Although I don't deny that statement at all.  Third of all, for affirmative actions, I think Asians (especially oriental Asians) are as bad, or even worse than caucasians in lot of cases. Go figure. I actually wish I was white. Heh being a minority without the minority benefits and without the majority race ADVANTAGES is like a bogus race to me. WOH NEXT NINE HOURS KNOW-NOTHING SUPPORTERS PLEASE JOIN ROB MUILENBURGE! PROTECT THE INFALLIABLE RACE OF BLUE EYED BLOND HAIRED CAUCAUSIAN MALES! Oh yeah, you HAVE to be STRAIGHT. NO GAYS ALLOWED!   INFALLIABLE RACE OF BLUE EYED BLOND HAIRED CAUCAUSIAN MALES DOMINATE THE EARTH, I know my friends. Although I'm ok with that. it's life. It's the majority race that wins everything.

      Thomas, let me extend a welcoming hand for you to shake in joining my militia of pro-homosexual terrorists.  Clearly we're becoming more militant by the second, and sooner than later we'll be suicide bombing the Fox News Channel.  Just kidding everyone, but I should make it known that ASB President is just the first step on the staircase of Ultra-Leftist Facism. I dare anyone to try and figure that out.  Anyway, I'd like to make it known that I was joking when I told Kolk she was flat out wrong.  That was me making a joke as well as pleasing my ever-expanding ego (I no longer recognize other opinions).  JKo knows I'm just playin, so all's gravy in my eyes.  I decided that I'll take a few hours off of GM rants and focus my attention on another group of individuals that is having a harder and harder time defending itself:  Heterosexual able-bodied blond hair blue eyed caucasian males.  In Thomas' post he mentioned the fact that gays are probably more loving w/ a probable smaller divorce rate.  It's that kind of heterosexual discrimination that I'm getting sick of.  Ask Chris Mitchem how hard it is to get a milkshake at McDonalds without being sneered at by the caucasian females working behind the counter- not knowing what vile bodily fluids have been hawked into his order.  Heterosexual able-bodied blond hair blue eyed caucasian males unite!  We want our close parking spots back from the handicapped.  Our innercities back from the various ethnicities.  Gynecology back from those oppressive stick-together females.  Thomas Chen will never know the difficulties of non-affirmative action.  Ask Ben Perry how hard it is to get a scholarship for being a non-minority!  For the next 9 hours I'd like to reinstate the Know-Nothing party.  Who's with me!?  After that nine hours expires it's very likely I'll go back to the minority supporting spam that got me attention in the first place, but until then, all you non-heterosexual able-bodied blond hair blue eyed caucasian male bigots better look out.  Power to the people!  Love Rob

      Wow Rob you were exactly right. Yesterday was a lull before today's storm. I have to say that although I take hardsides and are extreme sometimes, I think that it's disrepctful to call other people flatly wrong. Political issues will never have a complete 100% right or wrongs. Yeah so there!  On to the gay marriage debate, I will have to side with hardline pro-gay coalitions forces. Rob's article lets you have a glimpse of the emotional traumas and unexplicable sorrows and guilts gay people already have in their minds that they cannot communicate. Much of it of course caused by the phobias from society. Most gays have gone through (or are going through) constant fear of discriminations from the society already. These frivolous fear of gays (WITHOUT ANY SINGLE SCIENTIFIC BASIS!) are simply baseless and are simply stemming from the conformist stereotypical mainstream society's view. Denying the gays the right to marry (for they probably have more love and less like to divorce anyways) simply manifests itself from subtle stereotypical view towards gays, even if you don't want to admit it.  Discriminating against gays is completely analogus to any other form of discrimination of any RACE, or even GENDER. Just because they physically look different, act different, think differently DOES NOT make them inferior. ONLY a criminal would do so.  This great nation generously help the disabled, and the mentally retarded. We have special access, special privileges, and special facillities for these people so they can have the same opportunities as everybody else. And besides that gays are as intelligent and as abled in every intellectual as straights. Any supposedly "disabled" abilities of gays are purely the result of social pressure and phobias. If we do do our best helping disabled , why not help gay people achieve equality too? And of course everyone knows that disabled and mentally retarded people are that way because of nature(They didn't become disabled because it's cool to!) and there should be no denial into the genetic factors behind gays, AND so WHY favor some biogenetic factor over others??  How can we truly live up our meaning of freedom and equality for all if we turn a blind eye on a GROUP of citizens? I apologize if this post offended anyone.

      I don't know why we can't change peoples' feelings or beliefs.  I think we have to.  I believe it was MLK that said "we can't stop people from hating us, but we can make laws that makes it illegal to lynch us."  The change has to start somewhere, and protecting homosexual rights in the courts is the first step towards their universal acceptance.  (Ferg is gonna hate me for this but) Take the Civil War for example.  The 13th ammendment freed the slaves, the 14th protected them in the courts, the 15th let them vote.   Although gays haven't been forced into labor and don't need emancipation, the next step is to protect their rights.  Last year there were 2051 reported hate crimes based on sexual preference, up 8% from the number in 2002.  Along with protecting gay civil rights, the advancement of homosexuals will hopefully reduce the very negative anti-gay sentiment (whether conscious or not) in this country.  Kolk, you give me a good reason why gays don't have the right to marry and I'll either tell you why you're wrong, or apologize profusely.  Everyone is "different."  Why limit marriage requirements to what is done in the bedroom?  Without getting naughty, there are plenty of crazy ass things done in the bedroom besides same sex interaction.  Plain and simple, civil unions divide the society over reasons the majority of the posters find unworthy of debate.  I also want comments on the article by Andrew Sullivan- a homosexual republican.  Go Figure  Love Rob

      Though I haven't had the same experiences, I totally agree with Megan. I don't understand how being gay is morally wrong. I think that debating GM can be very pointless. The main issues lie in a person's beliefs, and debating the issue will not change how someone feels. The only debate is whether our great nation will allow everyone the same equal rights. I think it's amazing that our nation still hasn't resolved this issue, because to me it doesn't seem very complicated. Either we allow everyone to marry, and marry whomever they choose, or we deny part of our nation these equal rights. Marriage is between two people, who gave the rest of the country the right to tell them they cannot get married?  Steph B.

      Being gay is not morally wrong. I don't understand how people can say this. It doesn't make any sense to me. I never realized how many people have "problems" with gay people until I moved to Washington. It really makes me angry and I just fill with sadness. I've been around gay people my whole entire life. There is nothing anyone can tell me that would make be believe that being gay is wrong. It's so hard for me to debate this issue, because I believe that it should not even be an issue. The fact that people I care about can not legally marry the person they love infuriates me.  Does God think it's "right" to be gay? Is God ashamed at my talented intelligent cousin for being gay? Has she been a sinner her whole life just for being gay? Should she be looked down upon for being gay? Well she is. And she is terrified at what the reaction of other people will be if they find out that she is gay. Responding to Clark's questions about the effect of personal rights and civil liberties on presidential elections I think that is has great relevance. Bush is against gay marriage. This is what swayed my vote. If I was born 12 days earlier I would not vote for Bush. This may seem like a stupid reason to decide how to vote, but it's reason enough for me. This is how I feel. I can not rationally debate this topic because hearing the opposing side just breaks my heart.

      Kolk, you're wrong.  I don't see how you feel GM changes HM in any way.  Props to your EC stance, but MARRIAGE is as important to gays as it is to straights at least according to this article.  Check it out.  Why The M Word Matters To Me  Only marriage can bring a gay person home  By ANDREW SULLIVAN  Feb. 16, 2004  As a child, I had no idea what homosexuality was. I grew up in a traditional home — Catholic, conservative, middle class. Life was relatively simple: education, work, family. I was raised to aim high in life, even though my parents hadn't gone to college. But one thing was instilled in me. What mattered was not how far you went in life, how much money you earned, how big a name you made for yourself. What really mattered was family and the love you had for one another. The most important day of your life was not graduation from college or your first day at work or a raise or even your first house. The most important day of your life was when you got married. It was on that day that all your friends and all your family got together to celebrate the most important thing in life: your happiness — your ability to make a new home, to form a new but connected family, to find love that put everything else into perspective.   But as I grew older, I found that this was somehow not available to me. I didn't feel the things for girls that my peers did. All the emotions and social rituals and bonding of teenage heterosexual life eluded me. I didn't know why. No one explained it. My emotional bonds to other boys were one-sided; each time I felt myself falling in love, they sensed it, pushed it away. I didn't and couldn't blame them. I got along fine with my buds in a nonemotional context, but something was awry, something not right. I came to know almost instinctively that I would never be a part of my family the way my siblings might one day be. The love I had inside me was unmentionable, anathema. I remember writing in my teenage journal one day, "I'm a professional human being. But what do I do in my private life?"   I never discussed my real life. I couldn't date girls and so immersed myself in schoolwork, the debate team, school plays, anything to give me an excuse not to confront reality. When I looked toward the years ahead, I couldn't see a future. There was just a void. Was I going to be alone my whole life? Would I ever have a most important day in my life? It seemed impossible, a negation, an undoing. To be a full part of my family, I had to somehow not be me. So, like many other gay teens, I withdrew, became neurotic, depressed, at times close to suicidal. I shut myself in my room with my books night after night while my peers developed the skills needed to form real relationships and loves. In wounded pride, I even voiced a rejection of family and marriage. It was the only way I could explain my isolation.  It took years for me to realize that I was gay, years more to tell others and more time yet to form any kind of stable emotional bond with another man. Because my sexuality had emerged in solitude — and without any link to the idea of an actual relationship — it was hard later to reconnect sex to love and self-esteem. It still is. But I persevered, each relationship slowly growing longer than the last, learning in my 20s and 30s what my straight friends had found out in their teens. But even then my parents and friends never asked the question they would have asked automatically if I were straight: So, when are you going to get married? When will we be able to celebrate it and affirm it and support it? In fact, no one — no one — has yet asked me that question.  When people talk about gay marriage, they miss the point. This isn't about gay marriage. It's about marriage. It's about family. It's about love. It isn't about religion. It's about civil marriage licenses. Churches can and should have the right to say no to marriage for gays in their congregations, just as Catholics say no to divorce, but divorce is still a civil option. These family values are not options for a happy and stable life. They are necessities. Putting gay relationships in some other category — civil unions, domestic partnerships, whatever — may alleviate real human needs, but by their very euphemism, by their very separateness, they actually build a wall between gay people and their families. They put back the barrier many of us have spent a lifetime trying to erase.   It's too late for me to undo my past. But I want above everything else to remember a young kid out there who may even be reading this now. I want to let him know that he doesn't have to choose between himself and his family anymore. I want him to know that his love has dignity, that he does indeed have a future as a full and equal part of the human race. Only marriage will do that. Only marriage can bring him home.

I was reading catcher in the rye now im on to Tom O'brian Tomcat in love.... its a rather racy book as we dicovered on the buss back from st helens!   well i hope everyone has a super day day and remembers "safe sex is no sex and straight marriage is best!"

      Hey all of you happy bloggers. Paul, it is a good thing I will not be old enough to vote in this election because I don't like either candidate.  Anyway I am really posting to discuss the Da Vinci Code, a book of which I just finished reading. With all of the hype concerning this book and input from others who have read, I was excpecting a great book that would address controversial issues of religious history. The book failed to meet the standards I had set, and completely let me down. It actually turned out to be the most annoying book I have ever read. First of all the author, Dan Brown, used all kinds of foreshadowing trying to keep you stuck on the book. He would hint on subjects or different happening that wouldn't actually take place until 4 chapters after comment. So as I read I would try to concentrate on the matters before me but I constantly had the thought of his foreshadowing in my mind. So I could not put the book down, and usually people use that phrase to descirbe a book that really interests them but in this case I just needed to find out the stupid answers to the stupid questions. By the time I found the answer or I reach the happenstance that had been revealed tens of pages beforehand, I would now have experienced more of the same types of comments and the vicious cycle would restart. I know that this kind of writing is common but I think the author really overused its use and it started to get on my nerves. I guess that means Dan Brown is a good writer because however conniving his tactics, I could not put the book down.      Another problem I had with this is finding the difference between fact and fiction. There were some very interesting ideas posed but I would like to see justification for some of the statements made because the only way they would be cool is if they were true. Anyway despite my conflict the Da Vinci Code, I am reading the prequel Angels and Demons, I guess I am still trying to fulfill my initial hopes for greatness from the first. If any of you have read the book I am curious as to your thoughts on it.  Rob you are my sunshine Chris

      I heard Gore's speech yesterday, very, um, how should we say eloquent.  He's about as motivating as a tree stump.  A dead tree stump.  Seriously, I love Howard Dean, the dems should have run him.  "And then we're going back to Washington DC to take back the white house- YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!".  Howard Dean is great.  Kerry is lucky to have him drumming up support for his campaign.  In other news Kerry backed out of his plan to not accept the nomination(which would not allow him to raise anymore money).  He had the gaul to blame Bush, "Because Bush didn't limit his take to 19 million and take matching funds, it forced Kerry to consider not taking the nomination" to paraphrase.  What an ass.

      So, I looked up Robert McNamara - very controversial.  I'm excited to watch the movie.  I think it's always interesting when people who actually shaped the past are able to look back with perfect hindsight and evaluate what they did - right and wrong.  He said in an interview, "This century [the 20th] will go down as the bloodiest...we'll have lost 160 million people killed in conflict."  That's too many, I hope THIS century will be a lot more peaceful.  Speaking of which, how about the new warning from Ashcroft?? And... Gore's speech today, OH MY!  Anyway, have a good night!

      Hey Bloggers...Who says the abortion topic is dead.  You seem to have plenty to say about it...and your knowledge about contraceptives is very admirable.  I also appreciate how you relate it to the constitution and personal rights.  So many major issues in American history are related to personal rights and civil liberties.   Do you think this issue has enough relevance to sway how you would vote for president?  Should it?  College portfolios...I think the college admissions process would be an interesting topic to debate...especially after out discussion in 2nd period today.  I think the movie Fog of War will lead to some interesting discussion.  For some of you it may help if you look into the life of Robert McNamara before watching the movie.    I love the post AP period...it actually gives us time to get to know each other.  Have a good evening and see you tomorrow.

      Based on my own beliefs I'm against abortion.  I feel that both the morning after pill and first term abortion are wrong for me.  Adoption can be much better in the long run for the baby and the mother.  Many women who have had abortions say they wish they hadn't.  Abortion is not something you can take back.  Before women choose to have an abortion they should realize and understand its effects on their body.  However, this is America, one of the few places on Earth were people can live freely.  Therefore to deny a person the right to choose what to do with her own body goes against what we as Americans stand for. One issue that really itches me is what role should fathers play in abortion?  In reality it took an man and a woman to make the baby, but the baby only grows inside the woman.  Is abortion a woman's struggle?  Just curious.

      I agree with Natalya.  I don't think that a group of people (aka the government) can impose their beliefs on another group of people.  On the issue of GM, it is ridiculous to say that two people who love each other and are willing to make that kind of commitment to each other can't because said people are both of the same gender.  Also, I think that the "slippery slope" argument is stupid.  Just because I see two women getting married on TV, I'm not going to go out demanding all kinds of other pointless things like the right to marry my cat.  And as for abortion: while the idea of killing babies (or fetuses that could potentially be wonderful people someday) really bothers me, I don't think that I have the right to tell my friend that they can't have an abortion.  It was interesting because I went into class set on the opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, and left class with the opinion I just stated.  Finally, the fat kids.  I really don't know what to think.  On one hand, I think that taxing junk food is a little extreme.  But on the other hand, children are ridiculously occupied with Doritos and Halo, and do absolutely NOTHING.  But how could the government take a role?  They obviously attempt to control what is being served in schools and make it nutritious, it just as obviously doesn't work (look at Skyview's menu).  P.E. classes are ineffective.  And the government, while they can run things like schools, shouldn't be allowed to dictate what people eat at home.  I guess the best solution is the one Tyson mentioned, where the government looks at what corporations are putting in their foods and look for healthier alternatives.   OK, I'm done now. If there is a flaw in any of my arguments, I'm sure someone will let me know. Bye.

      I think it's important to be realistic in this debate, if not simply because idealism will fail to present any real answers.  Pragmatism is key, and I think everyone needs to keep in mind that while America is a land which prides on being the land of opportunity for millions it is not.  America's middle class has been shrinking, and will continue to shrink while the lower class grows and upward mobility stalls.  With the education system in general disarray especially in impoverished areas, I think it's rather unrealistic to expect a majority of foster children or impoverished children to grow up to cure cancer or become doctors lawyers and indian chiefs(due note the culture reference there).  Not that I approve of abortion but we have failed to help the lower classes in the country, the reasons we have are up for debate(and would make for a good one), but I think not exasperating the problem is good policy.  Gay's should marry, marriage is secular in that it's awarded by counties irregardless of religion and brings with it financial benefits tax-wise.  Since these are both government imposed and our government is secular and thus should take no cues from religious authorities, I think gays should be allowed to marry.  If the word marry bothers people too much, I wouldn't be too opposed to changing the official term to civil unions for everyone and making marriage a religious only institution.  Maybe we could get 'civil unionized' at the justice of the peace, but married at a church, and the churches could decide to not let gays 'marry' perse but they could still reap the financial benefits and official representation from a 'civil unionization'.  Or we could just get it overwith and let the gay people marry.  It's going to happen eventually, why put up such a fight?

      I personally think its wrong, better yet "morally wrong" to impose your morals on any other person or a group of people, that is concerning gay marriages and abortion. I mean if religious people believe that abortion is wrong no one forces them to have it, but they can't hinder other people in their choice to have abortion. There is lot of idealistic talk around here, especially saying that the problem would be solved if people simply stopped having sex, but the fact is human instincts often take over reason and a lot of people don't even see anything wrong with having sex. The question then is how we can help those people that do have "accidents" and are irresponsible. I heard a lot of people say that instead of being aborted the child should be given to foster care, which I think is even greater irresponsibility. It's irresponsible to throw away your child once you gave life to her/him, abortion in a way is taking responsibility of your actions; once that child is in the foster care you will never know what kind of a life that child will have, whether he/she will be abused, sexually harassed or simply have an unhappy life knowing that he/she was an unwanted child, thrown into the world as a homeless dog. Many say that there are a lot of couples that simply dream adopting cute little babies and providing them with a wonderful life, but there are lot of kids in foster care around the world and all of them in no way possible will have enough couples to be adopted by. Anyway, I think the pill is one of the most important innovations in history of womankind, it eliminates that dead end of either having abortion or giving birth and then giving up that precious life to the "cruel and perilous world."   Concerning gay marriages, Rob has voiced my opinion in the best way possible. Afterall this is America...  my country tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing. So shouldn't we all have the right to love and to live our lives happily as we wish to as long as we don't harm anyone else. I mean do you become physically or mentally harmed if you see a married homosexual couple? What goes on in their bedroom is of no ones business but theirs, and I think who should be of more concern are the preachers who vigorously preach about homosexuality as a sin and a "morally wrong doing" and then go an have "fun" with their own little "buddies" seven years old, sick.

      I think everyone in this blog is missing the point of emergency contraception.  It does NOT cause an abortion.  Because that fact seems to get so easily confused, let me explain how pregnancy and conception work.  After intercourse that ends in ejaculation, sperm cells may live in the very hospitable environment of the vagina for about 5 days.  If there are sperm still living in the vagina during the time of ovulation it is very probable that a pregnancy will occur.  What the morning after pill does is prevent the egg from being released therefore preventing pregnancy or prevent a fertilized egg from implantation in the uterus where it would THEN begin to mature.  This IS NOT an abortion!  With that logic, everyone that takes the birth control is instigating one indefinately long abortion, which they clearly are not doing.  Furthermore, the point of emergency contraception is not to be a primary source of birth control in the first place.  A fully functioning condom used properly is more effective than EC, but sometimes the condom comes off, breaks, or "little spermies get out" for whatever reason, opening the door to an unwanted pregnancy by responsible sex-havers.  Another scenario is a rape/date-rape situation where sex was not planned.  It is unfair to the rape victim as well as the bastard child that results from the unwanted pregnancy.  Lastly, I know there will be a situation in which one of these bloggers will get caught up in the passionate moment and omit protection.  I'm not excusing irresponsibility, but why risk the pregnancy if there is a safe, non-abusable form of contraception that could eliminate the unwanted consequence?  It's fine to criticize EC's use from a seperated vantage, but wait until you or your partner is panicking because the condom broke, and try to tell me you wouldn't want an easily available solution that ultimately PREVENTS abortion if that is the last resort for an unwanted pregnancy.  I honostly don't see where a debate against this medication stems from other than ignorance, but consider yourselves educated now.  The only safe sex is abstinence...  Love, Rob

      I have to disagree with Chris on the morning after pill and abortion. They both terminate a pregnancy. I think if people think they are responsible to have sex, then they should be responsible enough to use protection. I know condoms aren't always 100% effective and sometimes little sperm-ies get out, but if you are responsible enough to have sex, you have to be responsible enough to deal with the consequences, whatever they might be. I think some people use abortion and the morning after pill as a form of birth control after they have had sex, rather then using birth control before or during. If you aren't ready to have kids, then you aren't ready for sex. I think if people weren't so caught up on acting older then they are, we wouldn’t have to have this talk about whether abortion should be legal or not, because there wouldn’t be a high number of unwanted pregnancies.

      Wow, it is nice to see all of the debate going on and it is nice to see everyone's different views. Rob, congratulations on the longest, most well-constructed blog in the history of blogger. The current debate topic of abortion and birth-control seems to manifest a rift between morals and science. The problem now is to recognize the difference and form opinions/arguments. Chris is certainly right-on when he talks of the moral similarities between taking the morning-after pill and an abortion. However, as the morals are similar, the science and event of each are so drastically different that it separates the moral argument on a scientific level. I would say that it would be much more demoralizing for a woman, perhaps her boyfriend and parents as well, to go through a surgical abortion. If taking a pill after sex allows a girl to not have to go through with an abortion this then reduces a life-changing experience to a gulp...And a swallow. Therefore, the repercussions of each event and the moral affect that those repercussions have, separate the two.   ~Holla

      Hey all, I don't mean to light the fire for a debate but I don't have a problem with abortion, and I don't see how abortion and the morning after pill differ in purpose of use. Whats the difference between stopping something thats going to exist than ceasing something that barely does. A pregnancy is the process of producing a baby, once a mommy and a daddy have sex and the sperm meets the egg that process begins. Whether a person recognizes the possibility of a baby earlier or later, the possibility and probability of a baby are the same in both situations. If one has to use the morning after pill to stop the inevitability of a baby growing, then it is obvious that the person taking the  pill beleives that a baby has been conceived, and wishes to cancel that conception. Cancelling the conception is taking the possibility of existence away from that baby. Now how does that differ from abortion? Due to that, I don't see how people can justify their negative views on abortion while supporting the morning after pill.  When it comes down to it, both methods of ending a pregnancy are ways out for people who are not ready to become parents. And it is my personal opinion that a way out three days after conception does not differ from that of 3 weeks.   -I love you guys,  Chris Mitchem

      I'm going to kind of answer my own question about what people's opinions are of the morning after pill, because I never really did answer it myself.  For some reason, I really do not consider it to be abortion.  Because you can only take it up to three days after you've had intercourse, and you also at that point have no way of knowing if you're pregnant, so I don't consider it taking a life.  As Rob said (or maybe Ms. Clark said it, I can't remember), the morning after pill is much more of a form of birth control than an abortion tool.  Abortion is a deliberate choice to take a babies' life in it's (sometimes) later forms of developement, while the morning after pill is simply a safety net.  As for the gay marriage issue...this issue is extremely sticky to get around.  I personally, partly because of my religious background, think that being gay is morally wrong.  However, we live in America.  Here we are supposed to be able to have the freedom to do as we please, get the job we want, eat what food we want, and marry who we want.  It then becomes an issue of how far the government is going to get into Americans personal lives and try to take control.  Do they really have the right to say that you can't marry who you want to just because it's morally wrong?  Perhaps that's stepping in too far, but then I get into a conflict with my own morals of gay marriage being sinful according to the Bible.  Most of you probably don't know that in the United Methodist Church in the past few months, one of their pastors has openly admitted to being gay and having a lifetime partner.  They went to Portland and got married recently also.  Well, needless to say that opened up a HUGE problem within the church.  Not only the question of whether God thinks it's right to be gay or not, but also does the church want a gay person to be able to preach?  After a very drawn out trial (which is still being protested and debated) the Church decided that the pastor would still be allowed to preach.    Up until recently, I hadn't seriously thought about how much GM would effect and divide our country.  But just thinking about it from that one light opens up so many controveresies, and many more that are most likely to come.  It's such a vast discussion, and it can't be talked about with people's personal feelings and morals coming into play.  The madness of the world today...  Well, it is getting late and I should probably be going to bed.  I think that I've rambled on enough to bore you all to tears.  See you in school tomorrow!    ~Kimber

      I also thought the Life Skills Prom was a great experience. I thought that ASB did a great job at decorating and planning it. I think that we all made it a great night for them. I really got to see them have some fun and it just made me appreciate the little things in my life. Ha... I spent more time at that prom than I did at my own! Hope everyone had a nice weekend.

      Clark, How dare you challenge me?  The morning after pill or emergency contraception either prevents an egg from being released, or creates an unhospitable environment in the uterus to prevent implantation the same way that birth control pills, shots, and patches work.  The defenition of pregnancy is the implantation of a fertilized egg into the uterus.  I repeat, the morning after pill DOES NOT abort a pregnancy and there are plenty of on-line resources to back that up.  The pill is useful for unplanned intercourse including rape or condom breakage.  Studies show no harmful side effects, but unfortunately, the FDA decided (against surgeon general recommendation) that emergency contraception not be sold over-the-counter because of the lack of specific directions for use.  With any luck, that problem will be remedied and EC will hit the shelves hell-bent on protecting against unwanted pregnancy.  Write to your congressmen to speed up the process.  Love, Rob

      Good Morning Bloggers...I agree with Rob...the Life Skills prom was and is an awesome event.  It is the best dance of the year.  I hope more of you are able to participate next year...it gives you a new appreciation and insight on what's important in life.  All of your posts are interesting and insightful and Rob your section on GM was well thought out but I do want to challenge you on the day after pill...I THINK (I have not researched it.) you can take the pill up to three days after you have had sexual intercourse...and if your egg is fertilized it would terminate the pregnancy which would be an abortion.  There is also the pill you can take several weeks after pregnancy that many abortion clinics are offering to their patients.  I am not sure how these pills sit with Pro-Lifers.    I will see you Monday...I am going to try and rent Fog of War today and prepare something for class next week.  Clark

      Kimber, I don't know what problems anyone but the Catholic church would have with the morning after pill.  I single out the Catholics because they are the only group I know of that has discouraged the use of birth control- which is all the morning after pill is.  It has the same chemical that a birth control pill does, and the same effect, just a double the dose of a weekly or monthly pill that interferes with the release, or implantation of an egg after unprotected sex.  It DOES NOT abort a pregnancy which is a common misconception.  The real problem with the morning after pill is that it is not an over-the-counter medication.  It is not marketed as a replacement for a condom or other contraceptive, but rather a substance that can be taken in an emergency.  Plain and simple, if the morning after pill becomes more easily accessable, abortion rates decrease.  Now on to the debate we had friday on gay marriage... why arguments against gay marriage (GM) don't work (many arguments against gay marriage overlap and I'm going to refute all that I can recall, but possibly not in the most organizationally logical, but bear with me);  Civil Unions:  The fourteenth ammendment declares any law abridging rights illegal and Brown vs. Board (fifty years ago last week) declared separate unequal.  Allowing gays to marry does not detract at all from heterosexual marriages, I'll get to that later.  Religion:  Besides the obvious Church and State separation, I'd like to challenge those who claim that their only opposition to GM is because God finds it immoral.  The only verses where the Bible expressly declares homosexuality sinful is in Leviticus, however, also in Leviticus there are laws forbidding mules, clothing made of more than one material, and the consumption of shellfish.  Even the most pious of midwestern farmers use mules, the devoutest of New York Irish-Catholics wear spandex, and the most faithful of Southern Baptists eat Louisiana oysters.  So why is the law forbidding homosexuality still relevant while so many Christians across the country would be burning pigeons, rams or bulls for atonement every day?  It is unfair to God, unfair to oneself, and unfair to homosexuals to be hypocritical in ones faith.  Lastly, there is no law forcing religious institutions to accept state-issued marriage certificates.  I know that I will not convince many to disregard a good portion of the Old Testament, but none should argue that universally legalizing GM infringes upon their religious beliefs.  Legalizing GM sets dangerous precedents.  AKA, the "slippery slope" issue: This argument suggests that there is something wrong with homosexuality in the first place.  That because heterosexuals can never comprehend its biological intricacies homosexuality is therefore immoral or wrong.  Some would argue that legalizing GM encourages homosexuality- to that I ask what is wrong with that?  Never mind the intended rhetoric of that question, the real contention is that homosexuality has been around since the beginning of time and will continue to stick around long after an ammendment to ban GM.  Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher.  Marriage is something that this group has to fight for.  A rite of maturity and consecration that has been to this point forbidden to them.  George W. Bush has proposed an ammendment banning GM as part of his Marriage Protection platform. I would ask the president to explain why, after two years as Governor of Texas, divorce rates in his states jumped up 6% after a steady decline over the last 25 years.  Gays can create the same environment of dependence and stability that the state provides benefits for.  Those who suggest that GM promotes infidelity, insincincerity, or various other ins promotes the very KKK/neo-Nazi idea that gays are inferior, as well as the perpetuation of the hate and discrimination that results.  Lastly, there is another argument that gay marriage opens the door to marriage to animals, or polygamy.  Marriage, ideally, is the manifestation of a commitment made in love.  Historically this has not been the case in heterosexuals when arranged marriages to expand fortunes and empires have been abused by straight royalty and peasantry as long as time remembers, and although that history has faded out, I see no reason as to why the commitment of two people in love has to be expanded to animals whom the law could successfully argue do not share the human emotion ideally involved in a marriage.  As for polygamy, I see no problem with it.  I have had first-hand accounts with personal friends of polygamists in Utah.  While the state doesn't recognize their marriage, the man of the house (so to speak) commits himself to each of his wives, supports his children, and the members of the family receive the benefit of an environment much healthier than that of an abusive or neglectful albeit "normal" household.  My conclusion to the arguments against GM is that in many cases they are the manifestation of an instinctual reflex against homosexuality.  I won't deny the fact that witnessing two males kiss does not sit well with me, but that is no reason to punish those, who for whatever reason, are physically attracted to the same sex.  If anyone wants to challenge my statements or add to my list of arguments to refute, I gladly accept the confrontation.  A metric plethora of people have claimed that GM is such a frivolous issue to get so passionate about, and on the first layer, I believe they are right.  But this argument is not just about GM; it's another pinnacle of the continuing struggle minorities have for equality in this America so proud of its Land of the Free.  Think about it.  Love Rob

      Hello all you crazy blogging children!  To start, I want to say that the Life Skills prom was so much fun!  Everyone that was there, you know what I'm talking about.  That was awesome.    I do have a question for all of the 2nd period, or 6th period kids.  On the issue of abortion, what do you all think of the "Morning After" pill?  I was talking to Bethany about it today, and I was just wondering if any of you had any imput on the issue.  Oh, and here's a random piece of info, for those of you who said that no one would want to adopt African Americans, or that the majority of the poor women who get abortions are black:  The amount of black women who get abortions is half of that of white women.  Black women actually have hugely decreased the amounts of abortions, and the reason behind it is because the African American Baptist Church has gotten so involved in enforcing abstinence. So..there's something to chew on for any of you all who had expressed that black women were having the most abortions in America.  I hope that you all are having a wonderful and fun weekend, see you all in school on Monday!    Kimber

      Hey!  I thought that our debate in 2nd period went really well.  For someone in 6th period, did you guys break up into little groups, or did you all debate it in one big group?  We formed two groups, with one watching and the other debating, and it went pretty well.  But it was hard, because we all wanted to hear everyone's ideas, but with so many people and only 45 minutes, most of us only got to talk once.    The MUN kids in our class are INSANE, spouting off random facts that are somehow relevant to what we're discussing.  If only we were all that smart...but, I've gotta be honest Thomas (and don't get heated), but I think that your issue on abortion in 3rd World Countries belongs in a completely different discussion.  Maybe I just don't know enough about Bush's policy, but I don't see how that effects the subject of our discussion on Friday.    And, for those of you who think that morals shouldn't be involved in deciding whether abortion should be legalized or not, I think that's impossible.  For example, I believe that no baby should be killed, but that if the mother has no way of taking care of the baby, that adoption is the best thing for it.  But someone else will feel differently, that the fetus isn't yet a person or that the mother has the right to kill or keep her baby.  That's a difference in morals and personal beliefs.  There's no way to take a stand on an issue like this without including your own morals.  Issues like abortion and gay marriage are built completely on personal opinions and cannot be decided in any other way.  PS  I'm not anti-choice, I'm anti-death! :)  See you all on Monday.  Bethany

      WHOA WHOA WHOA......This blog is really heating up now....and that's awesome news  The debate today was impressive.....there are some talented 2nd perioders out there that really SHOULD JOIN THE DEBATE/MUN TEAM.....following Rob Muilenburge's great and courageous step.  For the abortion issue, I continue to stress the fact that whatever the case, the ultimate responsibility comes down to taking care of the child, whether it's parental care, adoptions, or fostercare. I dissagree with the fact that any living cell is somehow given the chance to become a genius and those wonderful dreams are innately possessed in the process. It's simply not true. It's simply a wild dream to think a living cell born to a perfectly dangerous and alien society would be expected to grow up healthily or EVEN SURVIVE THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY STILL HAVE NOT OPPENED THEIR EYELIDS.........hhhmmmmmm maybe that's why infant mortality rates in third world countries are as high as 50%! Or half of the babies don't make it through the first two years of their lives. Hmmmmmmm how IRRESPONSIBLE are we then....how many more babies are killed and what's the strain on the society then. And that's not already taking into account the risk of lives the mothers have to go through bearing the child and raising the child up under extreme hostile situations.  I have to agree completely with how Bush's actions of punishing foreign country clincs that give out abortions would only hurt the destitute third world societies and does nothing to educate and prevent these kind of situations from happening again. The truth is, in the majority of 3rd world countries, and as a singlet example, SE Asia's Cambodia, sexual exploitations is extremely rampant (more rampant than anything you've ever imagined that could happen). Such poor countries. People younger than us would be SOLD BY THEIR PARENTS for prostitutes because the families are simply sooooo poor. And for us it is easy to "hey you have to understand the consequence of sex" and that, but many destitute people in third world countries PEOPLE SIMPLY DON"T KNOW AND HAVE NEVER HAD THE EDUCATION FOR THAT. EDUCATION and the corresponding higher level of social-economic status is the KEY for woman to make wise decisions. Education is the key for elevating the traditional degrading and subhuman status of woman in many third world countries. Thus, instead of withdrawing aids and funds from foreign clinics where abortions are performed, it's an opportunity for us to show our egalitarian American values and try to put more aids into education programs, and more aids so more people can lift out of poverty situations.   Yeah an thus, I think that abortion should be upheld simply looking at the world with reality......And of course if you are educated and wise and know how to make the choice, GOOD FOR YOU (you are extremely lucky and should be proud of yourself of not ever having the need for abortion), but for millions of others around the country and around the world.......There is a long long long way to go to create a perfect utopian society......   As for the childhood obesity debate, we'll see on Monday.  I also want to comment on the gay marriage issue here. The compromise for both sides would be civil union protections for at least basic liberties so gay people are not constantly in a state of fear and constantly being prejudiced. And ultimately, I believe that they should enjoy the exact same liberties and opportunities any other person enjoys. Because ultimately, people CAN biologically be gay. To deny gay people the same rights all other citizens enjoy would be like degrading disabled, mentally retarded, or even a minority race of people.

      Hey, what's up?  I thought the discussions in class went pretty well.  I just had to post my thoughts on the whole same sex marriage issue.  I agree with Megan, it is a person's own beliefs but religion is part of a person's beliefs.  My thoughts are that same sex marriages are morally wrong and they shouldn't be allowed.  But on the other hand, as Ryan Elliot said today, marriage is just another benefit for these people.  Not allowing it isn't going to do anything to the gay population.  They are still going to have the same relationships and everything.  I guess that it always will turn into a heated conversation because of so many different beliefs.  Anyway, that was just a thought I had after class. Keep it real!

      I thought todays debate went really well, and like a lot of people I'm against abortion but believe in pro choice. I think the government would have a lot of problems trying to make abortion illegal again. I believe many would see it as an erosion of women's rights. Just this Sunday a huge rally was held in Washington with over 800,000 people marching for pro choice. Like Sarah said, I also think that religion should not have a place in this issue. This issue is an all American issue. An individual's moral beliefs whether it is based on religion, family, etc, is not significant to everyone. Then you can get into ethnics and if the fetus is an actual baby and things just get confusing. How I see it, the law is already standing, and making abortion illegal is an infringment on women's rights to choose. Is abortion wrong...well I think it is. But what about freedom... the foundation of American identity.   I'd like to be honest and say that I am worried if 2nd period debates about gay marriages. This issue is extremely personal and emotional for me.

      My little dumplings are growing up...I think it is so interesting to watch adolescents begin to formulate and defend their opinions on such controversial issues.  I was watching many of you in second period with the personal struggle of Abortion being morally wrong yet unwilling to take a strong stand against others...hopefully you will continue to grow and think on these issues as you further develop.  Some of you will become more conservative in your thinking as you experience the "real" world while others may become more liberal.  Trying to figure out what you believe in and what you stand for is so important in figuring out who you are...and whatever that is I respect all of your ideas and opinions to the upmost.  Commentary...the second period debate was impressive...I was very impressed by your sensitivity and the resepect towards others...will you have the same resepectful tone when we discuss child obesity?  (I have to laugh because this topic has been hot on the news and NPR lately.)  Sixth period...the Pat Tillman discussion was interesting.  I am unsure how I feel or if I feel anything to be completely honest.  However, he will be the "poster" child for this war and remembered in many history books.  He is also an excellent example of the sense of Nationalism produced by the 911 World Trade Center attack.  I appreciate all of your struggle with the value of life...and yes I think we can all agree upon that everyone's life is valuable.  I think the discussion also brings up other valuable questions?  What is the role of the Media?  And who is really in charge of what we see and hear by our news media?  Who decides? Who pays for it? AND who gets the profit?  Obviously these people (dynasties) have a lot of power and influence over our nation?  The gay marriage debate was a little heated.  I think Ben may be right that is an issure that might divide our nation.  I like how Kalie related it to the Civil Rights Act - an example of a good history student.  But should our government be involved in a personal institution.  They set age limits? Should they?  Maybe we could lower the divorce rate by increasing the age and wait time before people get married...how about 25 and you must "date" for two years?   That might make our families more stable...their are so many other issues...maybe our goverment should control who we marry to make sure it lasts longer?  Maybe people weren't meant to be married...of course I am just thinking out loud...(Playing the Devil's advocate in most cases...)  I must get ready to boogie down at the Life Skills Prom.  Have a good weekend and I look forward to hearing about more of your ideas...  Ms. Clark

      hey guys its my first time on THA BLOG (im kinda nervous...) ne ways i just wanted to follow up on our debate today in second period about abortion and if the government should have a say in it. well... i dont think they should. I know a lot of people dont believe in abortion but that is their opinion and there may be some people who think differently.  us and especially the government dont have any right to tell those people how to live their lives. Mar i got your back on this one!! im against abortion but not against human rights.  bie bie

      I wasnt able to be in class today, as Ms. Clark already knows, but i do want to participate in the "discussion". On the issue of same sex marriage, I support the legality of it. Whether or not i agree with it morally has nothing to do with my decision. My decision is based on the constitutionality: our country takes pride in the freedoms we are guranteed as American citizens, many of which we take advantage of daily. However, with the Civil Rights Act of 1960, it is unconstitutional to descriminate based on race, national origin, or SEX (which for me, includes sexual preference). How can we stand by our constitution and the freedoms it gives us if it is not used to give these freedoms equally to ALL citizens? Along with that, even since the first colonists, separation from church and state has been established. Thus, even if it is morally wrong based on your religious creed, it is not justification for its illegality. I understand both sides. I see where religious arguments can come into play and how morals effect our ways of thinking, but we must see past that...we must see is it constitutional? And does it provide equal freedom to all U.S. citizens? ANALOGY  On the issue of Pat Tillman...i think i'm a little more conservative. Yes, he did a great thing, and he SHOULD be remembered because of his bravery and giving up everything he has here at home. But I think it is insulting to all those other soldiers fighting for the same reasons, but getting no recognition just because they arent pro-football players or millionaires...they also are giving up a great deal to be fighting overseas. They're giving up their families, their children, if they're in the reserves, their jobs (even though theyre not highly public jobs)...theyre giving up just as much as he is, yet are quickly forgotten. How is this fair? What are we as Americans supposed to tell the other soldiers' families when they die in action? they werent famous? they arent as brave as Pat Tillman was? NO! I DO think it is important that we remember him. Maybe we should name the stadium after him. But i think to be fair and equal, we must also give recognition to the other men fighting overseas. The issue of Pat TIllman is like group projects. Everyone does (or SHOULD do)their own part, working hard and diligently, but then when the time comes to present, the speaker of the group gets all the recognition and everyone else's hard work is quickly dismissed. That should not be the case here. Pat Tillman, although a well-known hero, was part of a team. He did his part, along the sides of many other brave men. When the time comes, which it has, shouldn't all the men get recognized for their hard work?   Well, that's my little argument that i WOULD have discussed in the discussion had i been there. Dont fret, i WILL be at school on Monday!  Kailie

      K, well here is what I have to say about the abortion debate that we had in class today...  There are so many factors that contribute into abortion besides just the idea of "killing an unborn baby". There are the ins and outs of foster care, adoption, women's lives, children's live as well as the state that our country is in.  I am religious, though I believe that religion can have no place in this issue. It is fair that everyone can have their own morals, beliefs and religious system, but what about the whole idea of separation of church? Just because "the bible says so" doesn't mean that is what our country should go by. Do you see what I mean?   I have a lot more to say on this issue, though I know there is really no way of winning the argument. Is there really a happy-medium? Because I mean if abortions were to be allowed for only hazardous pregnancies, rape and incest cases, where and how excactly do you draw the line? If it's okay for some women, why not for all? And in the case of pregnancies that are harmful for the pregnant woman, perhaps it is "God's will" that it ends that way? I don't really believe that, I'm just throwing it out there.   Anyway, I would never have an abortion myself, but I wouldn't want to take that right away from any woman who wanted to use it. Afterall, if abortion is against yours or whomever's religion, they will  have to take it up with Him in the end. We're not God. That statement can be taken another way: we can't take away life...but if we can make it, why CAN'T we take it away? And just because someone doesn't support something or even think it is right, it doesn't mean they should force that opinion and ways of life upon other people. That's all for now.   Peace.

      My comments about the abortion portion of the debate is this... I'm not pro-abortion, but I am pro-choice. Can I be that way? I don't feel that abortion is a legitimate way of escaping the problems of unexpected pregnancy. The woman should have thought about the consequences of potential pregnancy before she decided to have sex. I know I know, but what about the women who get raped. That solution would be solved by adoption. I have heard from some people that adoption isn't a sucessful option. What I have to say to that is where's your proof? With the process of adoption, the baby, at birth, is signed over to a family or a couple. It's not like the baby is being handed over to the state. It's the state that has the problems of foster care, or the problems people may think of when they hear of adoption as a solution. But anyways, should the government keep abortion legalized? I'm against abortion, but the to tell you the truth, the government should have no say as to what women do with their bodies. Abortion is a moral problem, not a legal problem. To say something else about abortion, especially the clinics. I wish that abortion clinics would give more information about the procedure. Abortion is not simply taking a piece of tissue out of a woman's body. Abortion is taking a life away, and no one can argue that it's not.

      HELLO MS.CLARK AND ALL MY GREAT FRIENDS FROM APUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IT'S BEEN SO LONG........I'm finally back from 130 hours of imprisonment in the Oregon Convention Center for the International Science and Engineering Fair.  Yeah the most common phrase over the last week for me was "Where are you from", gosh I've had to said it over 500 times............And from that I've met sooooooooooooo many people......from all 50 states and 38 countries around the world!!!!!!!!!!!! And the most valuable experience of this whole week was making such valuable friends.........And have the opportunity to meet future leaders, future billionaires, future Nobel Laureates, not to say that we had the chance to actually talk to the current Nobel Laureates.  And overall, there was TONS AND TONS OF FUN!!!!!! ENDLESS FUN....PARTYING EVERY NIGHT FROM SUNDAY NIGHT TO THURSDAY NIGHT...........More social activities the past week than I ever experienced in my life.  And tomorrow I'll have lots of fun tomorrow catching up with all the work I may have missed. And catch up on the current status of the impending party for our great APUSH teacher Ms.Clark.   And finally, I missed all of you the past week, hopefully you all had a fun week!  See ya all tomorrow!!!!!!

      APUSH Bloggers... I hope you realize that next time in ultimate frisbee the teams will be fair and you will all be subjected to the merciless wrath of he who is known as Rob.  Props to Frank for his beautiful catch, as well as disabling one of my best team mates, you are a worthy competitor.  I'm in support of JKo throwin a bitchin going-away party for Clark, and maybe next year we'll orginize a road trip to kick it with her in sea-town.  For any of you who enjoy the debates we sometimes have in class, I recommend you give Model United Nations a try.  I did, really enjoyed, and was fairly successful in my first competition.  Debate and compromise are great skills to develop, and MUN is an excellent medium for that.  Props to the Russian Federation on their team victory, and good job to everyone else that participated as well.  Love Rob

And I have to say you are definately one of the most talented and diligent classes I have ever had. So make sure you enjoy each other.  You are lucky to have a group of students who enjoy learning and thinking.  I expect great things from you in your Senior year and would love for you all to keep in touch!      Thomas I hope you are having a good time in Portland.  Make sure you get all the assignments that are due tomorrow.

      Well I would just like to thank Ms. Clark for being such an awesome teacher. Don't tell Mr. Emerson, but I felt that I was more prepared to take the AP history test this year than I was last year (but that could have been that I never really read the book last year)! I can honestly say that I feel bad for the sophomores who want to take AP US History next year, because they won't get Ms. Clark for a teacher. NOT to suck up or anything but I am really proud of you Ms. Clark because I am sure that this hasn't been your easiest year with the administration junk and all. But I am sure that you are happy that all your work has paid off and now you have a great job! So hooray! Plus now you can give us a bigger perspective on the journey of life! Hehe how is that for cheesy!

      APUSH bloggers... Although Forest Gump has a different, hilarious speech pattern, there is also a great deal of 50's and onward pop culture and history incorporated, and although the apex of the class is already behind us, viewing FG historically is an alternative and equally entertaining method of watching enjoying it.  Secondly, I want everyone's opinion on prom... the good, the bad, the ugly- and I don't mean Kolkmeyer's dress (JK Kolk, you looked hot and I love ya).  Would you want it at Union Station again?  Any feedback you can provide will help make next year's prom as ridiculously perfect as possible.  Congrats to Clark on her new job, but we'll miss ya next year.  Love Rob

      Hey Ms.Clark again, yeah thanks for the moral support.............Hmmmmm it's time to reflect.   Actually here I want to say thank you very much with my deepest appreciation for your great care and effort you put in as a teacher and administrator to support and help the Skyview students, and your efforts to make Skyview a better place.  Yeah and since this is the end of the AP test and, I have to say that this year has been a great experience in your AP US history class. I have learned and grown substantially both as an academic person and a contributing member of the Skyview community, thanks to the support of you and all of my great peers.  I know you will be leaving us next year, and I wish you the best luck as a vice principal and I'm sure all of my peers and I will miss you very much.    Yeah anyways Ms.Clark, you have been a GREAT AP US HISTORY TEACHER AND A GREAT ASB ADMINISTRATOR! I'll certainly miss you very much next year as I continue my journey through the Skyview storm.  And I'll come up and visit you sometimes.

      Hey my little dumplings...I am sure you did great on the test.  Take the Multiple Choice in perspecitive.  I am convinced if Tristan and Thomas thought it was hard...it was...and the test score is based on averages.    After hearing what the essay prompts were...I am convinced you did great.  In any event...you are all amazing people and have grown as readers, writers, and students.  I hope you will some day appreciate all of your efforts.  I can't wait to finish the last month of school with you...let's stay positive and have a good ending to a great year.  You truly are an amazing group of school.  Clark

      OH wow... RELIEF.  I was excited to take this test today because I was prepared!  History, unlike English, is a subject with definitive answers... it's an engine that needs all its parts to run correctly, and this morning I was purring like a ferrari on steroids!  Most of my answers I knew, atleast 60 of them I was able to narrow it down to two, and there were only three I wasn't able to answer at all!  I was soooo pleased, and the essays?  Right up my alley.  Don't take this the wrong way, I don't WANT to gloat, but I feel like I'm OBLIGATED to I feel so good about myself right now.  I'm sure everyone else did good too, because if you payed attention in class the last couple weeks, and reviewed a little bit then you had the tools for a 4 or 5.  If you want to get pissed at me for this self-glorifying post, you have that right... but make me feel good and praise me for my temporary genious!  Love, Rob

      Well, this test is over.......And which turmoil comes next??  Heh today's test (the multiple choice section) I completely threw up on............  Well first of all, the test commenced in an environment in which Zenson mistakenly said "This test consists of ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS AND SIX SHORT ANSWERS IN 55 MINUTES!"  And that just sent the room to completely dead silent with everyone stopped breathing!!!!!!!!!!!  And then the multiple choice section:  Soooooooooooooo HARD............SOOOOOOOO MUCH HARDER THAN ALL AND EVERY SINGLE PRACTICE MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST WE"VE EVER TAKEN!!!!!!!! Frank, Ryan, Tristan and many others would certainly agree with me. WHAT THE HECK?????????? About 80% of the questions were a wobble between two answers..........GOOD GOD I DID ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, SO SMALL PORTIONS OF THE QUESTIONS HAD A DEFINITIVE ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MATTER HOW MUCH HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE YOU KNEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 80% of the questions to anyone is just completely debatable.  Anyways, that's my extreme rant of the day.........I'd really like to hear others' opinions and afterthoughts about today's test. And oh yeah, have fun everybody the next week, I'll see you guys on May 17th.

      Anyways, Rob, when I mentioned to Matt "people like you", I was specifically referring to those people taking classes at Clark, and thus couldn't come to Skyview for the right classes because of the screwed up schedules.  But seriously good GOD lord, contrary to most people, to me, I actually have MORE stress now after taking this one AP test. Holy lord.....four more to go, four more battles to be fought.  Yeah I'll probably come to Skyview tomorrow after school review session just for the heck of getting in touch with society and conversing my mental state of stress with others (hopefully I don't contaminate other people with my stressed out minds).  All I have to say is that hopefully the History test goes better than today's kick-off AP test.

      Hey all you APers...I missed you today.  I walked around not knowing what to do with myself.  I hope you did well on the English test.    Tomorrow during class we will review post Civil War to ?????  After school we will work on AP prompts and stuff...make sure you are taking care of yourself.  Extra Credit Review Packets are due on Thursday - we will wait and have the AP celebration after all tests are done.    See you soon...

      Haha, Tom, I don't know what you mean by "people like you," but it made me laugh.  AP English really didn't bother me... I thought the multiple choice was on the easy side, answered all but four or five.  As for the essays, one will be good, the other two are a dice roll, there's no organization in so little time!!!  Anyway, the point is, one down, two to go...are we reviewing after school tomorrow?  Wanting to know if I should come.  Love, Rob

      Oh poor Matt.....Don't worry......Interview has absolutely nothing to do with what we are studying. I just had to bring it up to confuse you. (JUST KIDDING).  Anyways we are just review right now, in class and after school and on weekends.  I have to agree that WASL schedule did screw everyone over, especially people like you.

      What is wrong with hard working - I know many students/adults that would prefer not to be labeled hard working.  I also think it is the students or people who aren't afraid to work hard usually find the most success in life.  Depending, of course, how you measure success.  The interview - I SWEATED and STAMMERED and probably STUTTERED a few times.  I was interviewed by 15 different people.  It was a little different.  We will see if I get called into for a second.    This morning on NPR they did a nice show on Alexander Hamilton...they played up on his illegitimacy and being an orphan.  There is a new biography out on the man.   Are we ready to review Jackson to Mckinnely?  I am drinking coffee and taking notes as we speak.  For those of you who are unable to attend the APUSH review - Good Luck on the English Test...See you Tuesday.  How did people do on the Multiple Choice section?  Clark

      Here is an EXCELLENT article from "KidSource Online"  urlLink that provides insights into students' attitudes in schools with survey statistics and some common misconceptions. All students and especially teachers should take the time to read this article .   This statement below from that article is VERY true:    Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement:   Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.    And by the way, how did that interview go, Ms.Clark?

      Hey everyone........I guess today is Skyview's last day of school. I'm posting from the UW communications building computer lab.......UW is so nice! I am living in the infamous McMahon dorm. And our SIMUW group of 24 students is only a small fraction of ALL the countless number of high school/middle school students who are here for the summer living in McMahon. A lot of people are here for summer sports camps.   The McMahon dorm has a fantastic view of lake washington. The dorms are set up as a "quad", IE four dorm rooms in one vicinity sharing one living space/microwave/refrigerator/bathroom, and the best part, a balcony. The McMahon dorms is so oppressively hot (seems like the heat is always on even in 90 degree weather). The big windows are open with no wind coming in and yet the flies and bugs outside are attracted to the light inside. The first two nights the dorm is around 90 degrees and each room has one little fan to cool us off.......  As for the food, it's 1000 times better than anything we have in Skyview or nearby Salmon Creek. Each student gets $24.50 daily for food (all free).......Lots of stuff to gorge on........And some crazy SIMUW people buy dozen cartons of milks or drinks and freezes it overnight......crazy Ha one downside of the "quad" dorm is that eight people have to share one bathroom/one shower. So things can get interesting with shower/bathroom schedules.  The whole day spent here in UW is packed with stuff to do..........From 7:50 to 8:50 breakfast/community meetings.....From 9:00 to 12:00 morning lecture/activity.....1:30 to 4:00 afternoon lecture/activity.....4:15 to 5:00 computer alloted time.....5:30 to 6:30 dinner time, and afterwards free time to do whatever we want.  During the evening times we wander around the campus/dorms/travel to university avenue or university village shopping areas/movies/community solving math problems/or playing boardgames like monopoly or risk.   Yeah and finally the people here are so interesting.....just leave it at that.......Half of the people in this program are Canadians!!!!!!!!!! Ha............So interesting.

      My little dumplings...thank you so much for the nice send off.  I am so sorry I added to your anxiety and stress by not showing up on Thursday...Whoops!  I am very touched by your kind words and actions. I have the poster hanging in my condo amongst the boxes. I can honestly say I have never come across a more  caring and intelligent group of students.  I wish you the best of success in your senior year and your life.  The hardest part of this transition is saying goodbye to the students.  (I have teared more than once thinking about it.) You are truly amazing.  Please keep me posted on your life, college choices, etc.   You can reach me in July at sjclark68@hotmail.com or use the Shorecrest website...I will have an email account set up there soon.  I start work on Monday.  (Yikes)  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test...remember it is a tough test and your score may not always reflect what you have learned or know.  It is one test.    Last night I was watching 60 minutes...did anyone else see the Clinton interview?  What did you think...do you hate him or love him...how do you feel about the right wing conspiracy? Will he be able to live down the impeachment trial...was the impeachment fair?  It is odd...the last couple of weeks have focused on celebrating the Republican agenda in remembering Ronald Reagan...now Clinton's book and Farehneit 911 is coming out...there should be some interesting debates and discussions to blog about.  I do like what Clinton said about hate...there is no reason to hate a political figure but be able to disagree with their stance and opinion.   Thomas...I hope you are having a good time in Seattle.    Keep on blogging...I would also love to hear about the trips to Germany, China, and Georgetown...  Love ya, Ms. Clark,

      Well, I woke up and realized this college project is due next week, so I decided I had better get started.  Instead of using class time to do work I played computer games and now on a beautiful day like today I'm trapped inside until I finish my project.  Just my luck.  Have a great weekend and don't forget Father's Day is tomorrow.

      Wow, I just started blogging not to long ago, but I think it's fun.  To bad the year is almost over.  This college project we have to do in clark's is actually going to be very useful.  Well, if I follow it anyways.  I think I will though, I've already applied for scholarships that I would have never done if not for this project, and I Think I'm going to make it my summer goal to apply for at least 10 a month.  Get what I can out of scholarship money.  I also like the idea of applying to every school that is free to apply to across the country, just to make them all compete over me.  Anyways, I'm going ot bed.  I Need the sleep. ~CT

      Hey All MY AP US HISTORY BUDDIES!  Today's my last day of school........I'm going up to UW for six weeks. I have to say that this year has been an awesome year in CLARK's AP US HISTORY class. Despite a somewhat stressed out, apprehensive studying for AP Test period, we've had lots of fun in that class. We've grown both academically and socially.   So enjoy the rest of year three days of school.......Make the most out of your junior year.....Great memories will be with us forever. And old friendship and fun times may never be replaced.   Hopefully I'll see some of you again next year in AP English or AP COmparative GOvernment class!  FINALLY, KEEP THE BLOG UP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF YOU CAN, BLOG ANY AND ALL OF YOUR SUMMER FUNS! SHARE ALL YOUR STORIES WITH US!!!!!!!  Best Wishes  Thomas Chen

      Ahoy bloggers!  This is Sydney and Livy and it's the first time either of us has ever blogged.  I guess we're a little slow, considering there are only 3 days of school left this year.  Isn't that splendid.  We have decided that since so many people are disgusted with childhood obesity, we're going to do a little experiment on the issue ... So we're going to see how long it takes us to become obese.  This experiment will involve a lot of poptarts and chocolate.  Ummm we can't start right now though because we're sitting in history class right now, doing "college research."  Well, since this is probably the only blog that Livy and Syd will ever write - everyone have a scrumtrilescent summer and don't be too smart! - May the God of Poptarts smile down upon you all, Olivia Guest Pellegrom and Sydney Lauren Clos

      Ok.....I guess I was a hypocrite on my last post when I complained about people being up at 3:00AM.....Well this post here is a 3:00AM post on a Tuesday Morning! YAY Well there were justified reasons for this early post because a few hours ago I was still at the amphitheater attending the class of 2004 Graduation Ceremony.  Since half of all my friends are seniors, the ceremony was rather nostalgic and emotional and it's unbelievable that some of your friends are already graduating, and forever ending 12 years of public education career! And yeah.....I saw Clark and VA there, and Evan Cate's speech was astounding.  I'll miss those seniors very much.......AND THE CLASS OF 2005, WE HAVE TO BEAT ALL THE STANDARDS THEY HAVE SET!!!!! WE HAVE TO BE BETTER!

      Ok, I LOVE how everyone keeps saying they think that the discussion on friday was AWESOME, but on to the next topic, we have to present out books...Will Clark mind if I switched books?  my hitler Mein Kompf or however its spelled never came in, so I read to Kill a Mocking Bird, or of Mice and Men...yes, they were my english class books, but hey, I can present on them!  I read them!  I think this project we're doing is HUGE by the way, I just finished the calender thing we had to do...ugh...any suggestions on how to make this go faster? ~CT

      I was pretty happy with the way the debate went of Friday too, except, unlike the ones everyone else has posted about, mine got pretty heated, and for the first time, I was probably one of the quietest people in the group! But, while I was preparing for the debate, I talked to some of my senior friends about the issue, and i asked them if they knew anything about it. I was surprised to find that most of them didn't have a clue what the difference is between the two party's economic policies...they didn't even care! I was surprised b/c the elections are coming up quickly. You'd think that people would want to know about the policies that each party is proposing so they could make an educated decision and vote for the party they relate most with. I mean, I guess it makes sense though. The policies on gay marriage and the war in Iraq are getting so much more media attention. How are people supposed to know what the different parties are proposing unless they are given that information on the news or on the front page of the newspaper? Which is kind of interesting to think about: why dont the parties make their economic policies easier for the public to get a hold of? Do they really expect Americans to go searching for the information...NO! Please, we are all so lazy (I'm making a huge generalization here) that we want the information fed to us through television and bullet points. We dont want to take the time out of our busy schedules to find all the different policies out. I guess it's just a little something to think about...why are gay rights and the war getting more attention than an issue that directly affects every single American?

      I, too, liked the debate on Friday.  I love getting other peoples perspectives on these issues - which are SOOO complex.  Personally, I wish we could talk about taxes and the like the rest of the school year, instead of do this project!  Has anyone started writing their "Describe Yourself" essay for the applications?  I did, it took me 45 minutes to write the first two paragraphs.  So muych pressure - those things have to be PERFECT!  Well, anyway in the end I'm going to be very thankful to Ms. Clark for making us do this stuff now, not in the midst of Senior year!

      First of all, Corey and Julie, what are you people doing and 1AM and 3AM???? Go to sleep, it's good for you. Wow making food that early in the morning.....Crazy people.   I agree with Hilary's statement of older people generally carrying stereotypical views towards teenagers. One reason this may arise is the fact that teenagers really don't care about politics that much, only around 19% of 18-21 year olds vote! How sad! And then we complain about how the government only cares about healthcare/medicare, and we never get what we want......Well it's because we don't vote!!!!!!  It's really a damaging and detrimental cycle of teenagers not voting, then we don't get what we want, and then we teenagers think we are not important in the society and our vote doesn't make a difference, so then we don't vote......It's bad for our society.   AND THUS, SPEAKING OUT, AND VOTE!!!!!!!!!!! Voice your strong oppositions whenever you feel like it........And don't always let your parents vote FOR YOU...... I believe we should have more of those last friday's discussion types so more people can get involved in politics and research into what our country is actually doing, which directly affects everyone of us when we go to college and worrying about our financial crisis......And maybe military draft.   Everyone of you can start by just going to the schoolboard meetings........It's the first step towards understanding how our nation's bureaucracy works and how their policies directly affect everyone of us.   That's why Rob's honorable plan of sacrificing his vote for the vote of the whole school during the November election is such an unprecedented plan!

      I really liked the debate that we had last Friday. I thought that most of us were mature enough to listen properly and respect the views and values of our peers. I hate how our generation is made out to be irresponsible and wild, but I just wish that some of the older generations wouldn't classify all of us, because not everyone is lazy and crazy! I guess that I hope that I won't stereotype teenagers when I am old and rusty. Plus I think that with the knowledge that is available and the born genius' who are at Skyview, the future will be a better place than it is today!

      The debate on Friday went rather well.  The group I was with was pretty evenly split as for Rep or Dem, however we managed to not let it get too heated.  One of the main topics we focused on was tax cuts, which I learned a lot from.  I'm not into politics that much, but I do want to know more about the presidential candidates so I can vote in what I believe.  But as for now I'm making chocolate chip cookies, nothing beats homemade.

      Is it just me, but at 1 in the morning, you start to get hungry for breakfast?  Last time I was up this late (last night) I made pancakes, this time I have Belgian mini cream puffs, so good!  only about 8 bux at albertsons for about 30 of them, in the frozen dessert section in case anyone wants to try them.  If they have the mini eclairs, those are better.  Personally I could go for a Jack in the Box's Spicy Chicken Sandwhich...  followed by some x-box.  Oh ya, I didn't like that "discussion" we had on friday, everyone got so off topic so much, go from taxes to well-fare, to zoneing laws... ~CT (goin to get some food from J in the B)

      While my family and I were watching former President Reagan's funeral, my dad told me that while a President is in office they have to plan their funeral just in case they die in office. Now that's what I call planning ahead. You see, I remember the flag folding part of former President Nixon's funeral when I was little, and I hear that the other aspects of his funeral was rather simplistic. But then my dad busts out and says that Nixon was a Quaker. Thus, it was likely that his funeral was planned to be more simplistic and small... just the way he wanted it. I asked my dad if there was more media coverage on Reagan than there was with Nixon, and he said no, there was an equal amount. So if anyone wants to compare the extravagency between the two deaths, it was planned for Nixon's funeral to be more private and not so much exposed. So, maybe it's not because of the Watergate Scandal that Nixon's funeral wasn't as "big" as Reagan's.  I have to say that it makes me sick that some are speaking ill of Reagan. They're so focused on their politics that they can't even respect the former president. They say things like, "oh he was responsible for the spread of AIDS". Don't they know that he spent 6 billion dollars for the research of AIDS? I guess not, because they don't want to research the facts. How is it that they're able to speak of him that way even in his death? Someone in my history class once said, "Don't speak ill of the dead" and I totally believe that. Respect is key. Even if a certain president passed away, and his policies were ones that I don't agree with, I would still have respect enough to not argue against him, or attempt to discredit him. Some of you might be thinking, "Oh well you're a conservative so it's easy for you to say that now, since it's Reagan that died". NO, that's not the case. It's not hard to have respect for the dead, especially ones that DID serve our country, democrat or republican, liberal or conservative. If you want to argue or discredit any politicians, I ask that you please do it with the ones that are alive. Please.

      When I was researching for tomorrow's debate, I found many websites that seemed bias and quick to insult the opposing party's policies. I personally think that people should try and have open minds about the opposing position because it could give them more of a perspective on not only the opposite side, but their own side, too. I am glad that we are researching this topic because we need to see how the economic policy that Bush has implemented will affect us in the future. From the articles that I read though, it seems as though Bush's 10-year plan is trying to help the middle class when it will most likely benefit to the wealthy instead. Now it is hard for me to believe everything that one reporter thought, so I am going to look for more facts and see if Bush's plan is actually helping America and not just cutting taxes and putting more of a burden on the middle class. Hope everyone has a good night!

      So today I asked my parents what they thought about Reagan. My mom replied, "O I loved my puppy." "Yes" I said, I'm sure you loved your dog as a kid up but I'm talking about the president." Anyway, they don't care too much about president Reagan. They get very frustrated with the government and politics. They are rather liberal and quick to criticize. Anyway I was doing some research and I agree with Joe that Reagan's administration ended up raising taxes, and while Reagan stated that he would "get government off our backs" he ended up increasing the role of the federal government.

      Its interesting that people remember Reagon for cutting taxes and reducing the size of the governemnt, but in reality his administration raised taxes more than any other, and increased the size of the federal government.  He tried cutting taxes and cutting social programs, but it didnt work.  Also, he was in power during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, but what did he do to educate the public about the problem?  Nothing.   Also, people say he was great because he wasnt an "intelectual," like George W.  Isnt that a nice way of saying he was stupid?  I hardly see how that was a good thing.  ~Joseph Liberman

      Ryan, I agree that unabashed, unashamed, mudslinging political rhetoric poisons the mind! This may sound contradictory considering that a large portion of my posts include some sort of stab at Bush, but not EVERY issue. I listen to political talk radio for entertainment, not news. Lars Larson comes on at night and talks about how Abu Ghraib is a positive reflection on the Bush presidency, then Sean Hannity comes on and rants on how lame Bush is for not politically castrating, then executing Don Rumsfeld. Am I a fan of Bush or Rumsfeld? No. Do I think Abu Ghraib is the fault of either, no. I actually commend Rumsfeld on trying to delay the release of the photos— at least the man recognized the way of harm his boys would be put directly into as a result. Atleast I get a good laugh before I fall asleep. I understand why they do what they do. Mudslinging IS entertaining, the problem is, the political extremists that get put on the air collect a FOLLOWING for their charisma and idealism. It's rare that their is a perfect candidate for anyone, so in many ways, I could liken the popularity of a man like Michael Savage to the rise of Hitler in Germany. Many Americans feel that our government is gutless to act, and a man like Savage is all about American empowerment. With such political polarity being generated from CNN to Fox News everyone in the media, imagine the cult following a political MODERATE might generate! Talk about extremism!  Now the Bible. So often in history we praises the founding fathers for their briliance in drafting the Constitution. Leaving it open to interpretation, casting it in putty rather than in steel so it can mold as times change. Maybe God should deserve the same type of credit so often to the "revolutionary thinkers" of the late 18th century. Everyone interprites the Holy Bible differently, and that is generally accepted by everybody, but this is the first time I've really thought it might be part of the design. I guess the most important fact is that people are looking to God for an answer, and for that, I commend them. God is an invaluable resource. For any atheists out there, you're alright by me too, but get to know what's out there, you might find a doctrine you like.  Al Tu and I have decided that the U.S. should return to a monetary system similar to that of the Gold Standard, but slightly different. The beer standard. All government issued coins and bills would be backed by their value in beer. Also, all informal college sports bets would be transacted exclusively in beer. Long live the Greek System.

           So, for all of you who haven't heard of the issue of Multiculturalsim it may be time you have. What is Multiculturalism? Well, my personal definition and opinion is that multiculturalism is racism in a politically-correct guise. It holds that an individual’s identity and personal worth are determined by ethnic/racial membership and that all cultures are of equal worth, regardless of their moral views or how they treat people. Multiculturalism holds that ethnic identity should be a central factor in educational and social policy decisions. Multiculturalism would turn this country into a collection of separatist groups competing with each other for power. So what do you think?    Jon G.

          I have a similar story to that regard. I was a pro-choice dude till my frosh year. I remember a friend who even confided with me a few times that she was going to abort her 4 month old fetus; she'd told her mom, and part, if not all, of it was based around fear of her father. But the incident that really got me thinking was the night before we at Pendleton H.S. left for a district acting compostition in Portland. We were performing our skits and monolgoues for an audience, and one was about this girl whose mother forced her to abort her child, and then ran away from her mother, who kept trying to find her and bring her home. The daughter wouldn't, since she'd killed off a living thing in her womb. It was all along those lines, and I lost all pretensions for abortion (including the for population control bit). That piece of acting was especially powerful, and it gave me a very personal look at the whole issue. It is something living to me, regardless of its cognizance of its state, for it's growing and is a nutrient-needing being, possessing of a soul. That's how I feel.

      I know how so many of you have complained about bringing up things that have already been brought up, but I really wanted to tell you all about something I learned this morning during my first period class.  I was talking to one of my friends, and she told me that her sister (who is 19 years old) got pregnant about a month ago.  The baby's wonderful and everything's fine, but I then my friend told me that her sister is considering getting an abortion instead of having the baby.  Before hearing that, I had been fine with abortion.  I don't consider it to be killing a life because it doesn't really have life yet, and I was totally pro-choice and all that.  But after hearing that one of my friend's sisters is considering getting an abortion...it just made me so sad that she would do that.  Maybe it's just because of the personal connection, but I just don't view abortion the same today as I did yesterday.  My friend is so excited to be an aunt! And just to take that away from her and everything, just because it would be the easy way out just doesn't seem right to me anymore.  I may be over emotional or something like that, but hey.  It's all good to me!  I know that this is an old topic, so you all don't really have to respond to it or anything, I just view abortion completely differently now that I have a more personal connection with it.

          Ryan, your points are perfectly valid. I found myself reading some info sheets on economic policy last night, and I found myself very engrossed in it. It was either "Look what Bush's economic policies are doing for us positively" or the opposite. I found some valid facts, but also language that was deliberate, a spin to catch the public. I too often despise the political mire, and it can disgust me how politicians can continue to bicker endlessly along partisan lines till the cows come home, and there aren't any cows in D.C. Partisanship makes me mad, it was one of the reasons I was so ticked reading the stuff in the text book a month back on Richard Nixon - the old heated partisan warrior. You put this whole bickering gig in historical perspective, and I love that. Much more fighting than helping has ever been done in this country; truly, in the entire history of man. There's to much to loose for all our politicians to work together.      I'm going to become slightly partisan here, it may seem, but this is what I observed when reading yesterday: that we've been getting jobs back the last three months, but we lost several million in the past three years. There were some cool things that we have coming, but a lot of crap happened too. I hate that I'm not being specific, but I've got the stuff on me, so if you'd like I could show it to you, and I was carefully looking at this info, trying to be objective. I seem to have more bias against the Bush administration than the opposite side, but I saw that in myself and tried to look in that same light on those critical of the administration. Both sides have some valid points, but for me I'm not much of a Reaganomics guy, which we're living with under President Bush. I like that I'm reasearching, and it keeps me informed. I also don't like these tax cuts. To me, a government needs its money, its surpluses. We need the programs that the government provides - they should be limited so that people can't take advantage of them, but you need to have well funded programs. Raegan cut taxes, aznd limited funfding for some of these programs. I also wonder at these stats in the course of my research, whether they were caused by Bush's policies directly, or are a part of regular economic rise and fall, or both.     I hated being on the pro-George site, 'cause it was so obvious that they were trying to use stuff like patriotism to catch unwary voters for them. Both sides do it, and it disgusted me that they were trying to Big Brother me and take me for most of this country's citizens - uniformed, idiotic voters. Yet the uninformed part is more true, and I'm being judgmental to an extent. Just always be informed, go beyond the surface and see what's really going on. If you don't like George for instance, know why, and if you want something new, make sure Kerry would institute the policies that you would want; don't just vote a man in to get rid of another. I pray that we may have the best for this country. Adios and God bless.  Tristan

      Congratulations...you have made the blog work.  Your writing is interesting and lively.  It is actually fun to read because you aren't worried about getting a grade but more worried about making a point while entertaining your blogger friends.  I know many of you are tired of the GM issue but I think you made a lot of progress...there is a lot to think and evaluate on this issue...and will continue to be topic for discussion as many individuals continue to press the issue.  Ryan...great insight...I would love for John Kerry to embrace McCaine as his running mate.  Wouldn't that be an interesting team.  However, through the bias and hidden agendas we have made progress in many issues.  The history of America has been a struggle to define ourselves.  Every step of the way issues, beliefs, and ideologies have been challenged.  Howard Zinn has an interesting book called..."You Can't Stay Neutral on a Moving Train!"  He makes a great point.  It is nearly impossible to be completely objective based on your life experiences. However, I do think it is important to challenge yourself to think, listen and learn.  No one has all the answers...  How are you doing on your Democrat V. Republican economic policies? Can you share some interesting websites?  Also I wanted to remind you about the AP Party tomorrow night.  It should be fun.  Bring a shirt, a sharpie and dessert....you may want to team up with a couple people in the dessert bringing.    Good work...your blog is enjoyable to read...keep it interesting and informative.   Many of you seem mature beyond your years.  Gertie

      I abhor politics by nature because opinionated writers are unable to present facts without intertwining their own agenda.  As a student I process information daily, and have found the most effective way to learn concepts is through evaluating raw facts, and analyzing relationships between themes.  In politics I find this straightforward analysis nearly impossible because no source presents all of the facts on a single issue; instead, columnists selectively use facts to win imaginary arguments.  As a result, I find myself repulsed by political reporting.  I’m torn between the desire to learn about the world around me and the intense repugnance I feel toward the political media.  People make politics personal, which is unnecessary and detracts from progress.  I dream of a world where opposing political parties can discuss issues and make decisions based on what’s best for the nation and not what’s best for their respective organizations; however, I understand this is the nature of politics; they are purely subjective.    America is a half-constructed bridge, spanning the continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and the political parties are the construction team responsible for the next phase in building.  Because the political parties are on the same team it would seem logical for them to work together to build the strongest structure possible; however, since their inception they spent more time waging wars and fighting than planning for the future.  Government officials should be driven by building the best nation possible, not lining their pockets or making a name for themselves.  Unfortunately, this is seldom the case and the root of my inner conflict.  The role of the government is to create a healthy, sound country, and far too many politicians lose sight of this goal for me to follow avidly; however, because the fate of the nation depends on voters, I and others like me must swim through the political gobbledegook and get to the heart of the issues – I just wish I didn’t have to wear waders to do it.    -Ryan  PS - I admire all of you who closely follow politics and respect your opinions greatly

      It is funny that you drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway.  Also, I get high on a freeway, but freebase on a highway.  Curious.  Anyway, the Mariners have so much potential.  Promising start last night by rookie Clint Nageotte (pronounced na-zhot) who gave up 0 runs in six innings.  The largest Mariner problem has been synchronizing offense and defense (one has one f, the other has two).  Mariner's starters Joel Pinero and Freddy Garcia each have excellent ERA's, yet abismal records.  Lastly, the Pistons can beat the Lakers, and I see the finals as a tossup.  Anyone that thinks the Lakers are going to coast by anther lame-ass eastern conference team has another thing coming.  That thing is the ridiculously powerful Wallace and Wallace combo, Tayshaun Prince guarding Kobe, and my boy Rip Hamilton who took a page out of Jesse T's book and wears the Hannibal mask on his way to being the Piston's postseason leading scorer.  I prefer my TP hanging under, and I'll fight that to the death with Biblical references to back it up.  Love, Rob  P.S.  To all you concerned little kiddies in blogger land, Mary and I are good friends and remain to be good friends.  Last night we saw the Presidents of The United States of America play the Rose Festival.  I can say with 100% confidence it was the best concert I've ever seen for $5.  Long live Lump, Kitty, Peaches, and The Groovin Postman.

      CT brings up a good point... you do park on a driveway and drive on a parkway... weird.... anyway, we do need a new topic to talk about.. I haven't blogged for awhile, and I see we're still on GM.. From what I'm reading, its a touchy subject. personally, i agree with Rob.. I'm uncomfortable seeing it, but its not immoral. Yesterday, I saw a truck with a sticker that had this: Marriage = Man + Woman for a moment, i considered hitting him... but i enjoy driving, and if i hit someone, i will not be driving. People are quoting the Bible and such, but when it comes down to it, I believe that the big stink about GM is that most people are uncomfortable with the thought of GM, so they get other people riled up about it, and now its a hot subject. There's my two cents, and its time for a new subject to talk about...  uhh... hmm.... erm... why did the chicken cross the road? there's a website with how other people would answer: www.chickenjoke.com there. Laughter is the bestest medicine, so laugh it up!

      Something else to talk about?  I finally got on this blog, there's one thing.  But another is that friggen Ronald Reagon.  My dad went off on him about him being the last president he liked that America's had.  I really haven't looked up anything about him, and probably am not, but from what I hear, he must've been a good guy.  Still not interesting enough for something new to talk about?  How about You park on a drive way and drive on a park way...discuss... ~CT

      Just an interesting fact: in order to have your painting be exhibited at the Louvre you have to be dead for at least sixty years. I just don't understand why do you have to be dead before you can become famous or a hero. Look at Socrates who had been tried and killed for his work of science, or Copernicus who had been called a heretic for his proposal of the sun being the center of the universe, or Mozart who was buried in a common group grave; or Beethoven who was poor, deaf, and unacclaimed during his life; or Bach who was also poor with ten kids, and in a constant struggle with his employers - all famous composers after their death; or look at Van Goh who died poor, drunk and unknown for his great paintings; or the writers such as Solzhenicin and Pasternak who have been banished and sent into exile and now are known worldwide for their great works of literature. They all have been famous after death and will continue to be celebrated for centuries to come and yet during their life times they were either banished and criticized for their work or drunk, poor and struggling for survival. Now I got a bit off topic here. I was going to talk about Reagan and got carried away with my appraisal of true heroes. I hear everyone talk about Reagan and how great he is but really what was so great about him? It seems as if everyone forgot about him and his great deeds for a decade and bothered to discover a hero in him only as soon as he died. So what do you think he did that was so great, I didn't really remember him being a major personae in the APUSH book.   P.S. I just want to mention that no one won the Cold War, and no one destroyed the USSR. It destroyed itself, it simply had a malignant cancer which killed it from inside out. It's actually very interesting to hear and observe different perspectives on the issue of Cold War.

      I'm trying frantically to come up with something else to discuss so that we can get off the gay marriage issue.  So what kind of peanut butter do you all prefer: crunchy, or creamy?  Do you put the toilet paper so it rolls from underneath, or over top?  Doritos or Cheetos?  Haha, I'm just rambling now, but we desperately need something else to talk about on here.

      Hey Chris, Mary, Rob, and Natalya........WOWWWWWWWW WHAT AN ECLECTIC GROUP OF VOCAL AP US HISTORY STUDENTS!!!!!!!! I'm actually really glad that there is HEATED DEBATE about such a controversial topic as Gay Marriage.   It's so great to see that at the end or beginning of your posts, Rob and Mary, that you two have to reconcille with each other that you love each other.  Because we are all still great friends, no matter what difference of opinions we have. Yeah true friendship has to be able to withstand political debates!    Chris, I honor your detailed analysis of the motives/arguments/reasonings behind both polarized sides of this GM issue......Your post sounded like a mature moderator's post trying to bring together the two sides. However, I have to dissagree with you on one important fact, and that is, the Gay Marriage debate will not always go around in circles. Not everyone in the country (on both sides) is willing to sit idly and let the gay marriage issue be pushed out of debate like a gag order. Even if the issue of gay marriage will not be resolved for decades......It will eventually be ......No matter what end of political spectrum America's general populace stands, there are and WILL ALWAYS be the progressives who will change America forever. And here I have to insert my own personal opinion (WAAAAAA SCARY PERSONAL OPINION)......That I really hope the resolved will forever legalize gay marriage. And I'm convinced along with a lot of my peers that if America continues its 250 years of journey in the pursuit for the real meaning of freedom and democracy, that Gay Marriage will eventually be legalized.   But this can be a long wait........Maybe many decades......But I'm convinced that eventually it will happen.  Simply looking at America's past, you'll see that altho there are short term regressions to more goold old traditional fundamental values, the general path of America's history has always been taking the step to become more progressive and democratic and egalitarian (For such important issues now we take granted such as: From the first ten amendments to: ALL MEN'S SUFFRAGE, Public Education, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY, Women's right to vote, Separation of Church and State (including teaching evolution), Trust-Busting policies on monopolies, Social Securities, Healthcare/Medicare, Minimum Wage, Conservation, De-Segregation, Civil Rights, Sexual Revolution, Non-Discriminatory Clause(There the disabled gained their rights), And finally African American's Rights to Vote ). And shorterm regression of more conservative values such as prohibition on Alcohol and Jim Crow Lows just DID NOT WORK AND DID NOT LAST. Just looking at your parents and grandparents, which generation is more "conservative", which generation is more "free" or which generation strives for more freedom? (56% of 17-24 year olds suport GM as opposed to 19% 65 years and over). The more recent list that I will eventually able to add to the list of America's journey towards the true democratic values has become abortion and gay marriage.  And at the end, I love everybody here who has contributed to the great DISCUSSION OF OUR AP US HISTORY BLOG!

      All I have to say is that Rob said everything there was to say. I mean the fact that no matter what kind or how many arguments you bring forward, every person will still hold back to his/her own views/believes. I just wish people weren't so judgmental and close-minded, dividing the world into wrong or right, moral/immoral, good/bad. I personally believe that all of us have our own ten/twenty or however many commandments that we hold close to our hearts and which are precisely the reflections of our views on life based on our OWN individual experiences. That's the primary reason why I call myself "partially religious" and of course because I believe in God in my own special way... So therefore I invite you all to convert to Buddhism in order to experience the eternal happiness in the state of Nirvana... Long life to Allah.

      Rob and Mary, thinking of you two going head to head gives me the urge to get on a plane and leave the country. But nontheless I have been reading the arguments on the blog lately with interest. Both Rob and Mary both have very valid points and I'm sure if given the chance they would contradict one another into the next millenium. But the fact is and I quote Rob,"one thing I have learned through the GM debate is that you won't be able to convince anyone to drastically alter their position, based on religion or otherwise." So these arguments stewed up by the bright minds of our Ap US history class are hopeless,  in the end it all comes down to what you believe in as an individual. For example: Mary holds strongly to her faith, a virtue of which every question derived from the bible comes down to for answer, and uses this belief to battle and contradict Rob's arguments, while Rob uses modern situations as proof to regard or disregard arguments like Marys that are based upon faith. Both of these strong willed individuals represent 2 of the many separate groups in the battle for gay marriage, each group possessing a strong and opinionated following. The only problem with this situation is that neither group appears to be morally wrong in their thinking, and therefore there is not an easy way to chose sides. Due to this the battle for gay marriage will go around in circles in vain attempts of each side of the argument to gain a majority on the matter. But with each argument presented by each of the opposite viewed sides there will be arguments to address the stated argument and arguments to address the stated arguments argument, and with each contradiction those groups will move further apart from eachother as characteristic human stubborness is triggered with the attack on ones argument. With this reasoning in mind, I don't think that gay marriage will be legalized throughout the United States for quite some time. No one can expect a drastic idea such a same sex marriage to be accepted by a society of people who have been morally against the idea of homosexuality their entire lives. And with that I think I can safely say that I am sick of talking about it.

      I feel that the gay marriage discussion has gone on WAY to long, and that it is time to find a new topic.  However, I do have one thing to say on the issue. If anyone is against gay marriage, than please, don’t marry someone of your own gender.  Why can't we just live our own lives, instead of trying to control every one else?  If people just focused on their own morals, instead of trying to force everyone else to think how they do, than the world would be a much better place.  ~Joseph

      I feel like I've been polluting the blog recently (throwback to globabl warming which Ryan Knight claims is a myth) with my GM posts, and so I plan on leaving it with this last post on the topic.  It's not that I'll give up backing it till it's legal, so feel free to talk to me in person, but I've decided it's alright for the blog to go another direction.  So here it is.  Mary, I appreciate your love for me, and I hope you know it's entirely reciprocal, but I also hope you know that the Bible means no more to you than it does to me.  I hope I've made it clear that I'm familiar with what the Bible has to say, and CLEARLY we have different interpretations (I guesss neither of us can call either interpretation WRONG), but I can confidently say right now that every human in the world has a bias.  It's human nature to have some sort of preconceived notion, some unfaltering instinct that affects how we see the world.  Part of our bias comes from the society we live in.  We have our cultural norms, our milieus or what have you that would make aspects of the culture in our neighbors of Mexico and Canada confusing at times.  Mexicans have a very different view of personal space, not afraid to come sit right down next to you on an empty bus.  As the egotistical douche yet talented film-maker Michael Moore demonstrated in Bowling For Columbine, Canadians don't feel the need to lock their doors at night.  A scenario many not feel comfortable with in their homes in the states.  My point is that when it says in Romans that men turned to other men in unnatural lust, in Roman society homosexuality was not considered normal, especially not natural.  I myself get uncomfortable seeing men kissing (..."I am beautiful, no matter what they say..."), but I don't see it as immoral.  When there is a natural inclination to repel homosexuality combined with a society even less friendly to gays, bias plays a factor in Paul's writing.  Do you see where I'm coming from?  I'm not trying to discredit any of the apostles, but I do want to remind the world that they can't be expected to be any more than human.  (For the record, I'm referencing the New Testament exclusively because Mary referred to herself as a judeo-christian.  If you want my argument against the Old Testament, jump back a couple weeks worth of posts)  Moving on to data.  Even if Rush does cite his sources, they could be the product of any number of think tanks funded by any number of VERY biased corporations.  Tobacco did all kinds of studies saying how bad tobacco WASN'T for you.  I think NPR would be one of the most direct sources of info out there.  If you don't want to believe Sean Hannity, I don't really either, but you can trust a credible source like an NPR newsbreak.  Lastly because I'm a left-winged secularist who only gets A's because I wright what teachers want to hear politcally, let me back up one more statement with imperical data; going after your spelling was a good natured ribbing, but you were 1/9 in spelling marriage correctly.  (Take that whole last paragraph in a sarcastic tone, but the data I believe to be correct.  Do you want me to reference my source?)  My last statement will address you not agreeing with homosexuality.  Why not?  You know my arguments, and I guess you can say because that's your morality, but there IS a basis for morality.  I just want to know what yours is.  By the way, I LOVE Mary Tyner as a human being.  The great thing about this country is that we're all allowed to have our beliefs and opinions, share them with each other, and be homies at the end of the day.  Love Rob

      Thanks for the response Bob. You sure can quote stuff. By the way, I know how to spell marrIAge, it was just a typo. That was kind of a cheap shot. I find it amazing, though, how you can quote this, and quote that, but yet you don't know what verses mean. Again, people taking such an objective view when they regard the bible. You don't know how to interpret. Or is it that I interpret it differently? Obviously, there is a difference between us in what we regard as the truth. (By the way, Rush always tells his audience what his sources are, or if what he's saying is his opinion.) When it comes to the bible/religious stuff, there's a difference between having faith in a religion, or just believing in it. For me, it's faith. It's not that I take every single word in the bible and take it literally. That's not the intent. Just a note... Jesus, in his teachings, spoke metaphorically, or through examples and stories so he could teach his disciples. Thus, not everything is to be taken literally. These disciples, who you call bias, are the ones who have the first hand account and have written these accounts in their books Mark, Luke, John and so on. If you have faith, you don't think of these men as biased figures who totally disregard the views of others. I'm not saying don't ever question these men and do everything they say, they are the new gods now... ahhhh! What I'm saying is that these men, these disciples, in regards to christianity, are telling what they know, are telling what Jesus taught them. What I'm saying in all of this mumbo jumbo is to be careful when you use the bible for reference, everyone, because when you use the bible, you're entering the territory of religion, and you're right rob this is a history class, not a theology class.   If you really want to know my direct opinion on Gay Marriage, I'm against it. But the question is, to what extent? I don't even know the answer to that question, because I'm not against gay people. But I am against the lifestyle. I'll go along like it's normal, which is called tolerance, but inside my head I'll be thinking it's wrong and there's no way you can change that, the same way I can't change you. But I dare you to try.  Back to data, it's not like I don't use it. I QUESTION every blatant piece of data to ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF THE STATEMENT (haha, never thought I'd hear that outside the AP exam). I question not only the liberals, but also conservatives. I question my side as well because I want to make sure that I know what it is I'm believing in/ have faith in. Always ask questions. And make them simple questions too. That way, if you don't get a straight forward, simple answer, then you know that that person who is answering the question is BS'ing with you. So no, Robby Bobby, I don't just go with my gut feeling alone. I know the facts first, I repeat THE FACTS first, and then I perhaps use my gut/mind/brain/head, whatever you want to call it, that makes me decide what it is I say, do, think and stuff.   Thanks for the response. I love you Rob.

      Mary, I admire your commitment to your statements.  It's easy to hide behind rhetoric and avoid conflict, but by standing by what you say and inviting opposition you show tremendous security.  I would first like to address your alarmingly confrontational attitude towards numbers and statistics.  You are correct that data collections can be interpreted many different ways, and are often presented strategically to convey a certain point of view, but by no means is that always the case.  With my personal experience I find the majority number twisters to be those on political talk shows, including your beloved Rush Limbaugh.  Al Franken does the same thing, and I'm not trying to say it's strictly a conservative thing, but try and argue with the fact that states at the time of this post, approximately 117 billions of American dollars have been spent on the war in Iraq.  Or that since the invasion, 828 Americans have lost their lives in combat.  Tell me that statistic can be twisted to comfort the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children of those lost in Iraq.  If you don't base decisions, viewpoints, etc. on "imperical data," what exactly DO you base them on?  Gut feeling?  Gut feeling gets you the Salem Witch trials.  A clever little process known as the Scientific Method led the world out of The Dark Ages and into the Renaissance and is responsible for the development and institution of MODERN MEDICINE.  If I had cancer, gut instinct wouldn't lead me to subject myself to chemotherapy or radiation treatment— both cell-anhialating and physically exhausting therapies, but the imperical data that shows that survival rate is MUCH higher with those treatments would probably sway my thinking.  Moving on to your GM argument, I'm still unclear.  Do you believe that GM should be legal?  Clearly you have stated you do not support it based on the Bible, that is, the New Testament, but based on the current law, do you believe that amending the Constitution to ban GM is legal?  One thing I have learned through the GM debate is that I won't be able to convince anyone to drastically alter their position, based on religion or otherwise.  I have tried and tried, typed countless words, referencing countless verses, and yet I have done little to directly express what I keep alluding to: The Bible, New Testament or Old, is not an infallible source.  The most direct reference to homosexuality in the New Testament comes from Romans, which loosely states that men turned to men and committed unnatural acts out of lust.  It does not say that homosexuality is wrong, just "unnatural."  With that out of the way let me remind everyone that the New Testament is not document written by the hand of God, or even translated from God's divine mouth as some of the Old Testament was.  The New Testament is a collection of first-hand accounts with Jesus from various people; the Romans, Mark, Jude, etc.  The point is, the reader of the Gospel must remember that this collection of accounts is at all times subject to the author's bias, and even the deviation from the original meaning through years of translation.  For all anyone knows, "unnatural" as it was written might have been more accurately translated as "unconventional."  The Bible, New Testament and Old, contains excellent themes on how to live ones life as well as the most redeeming sacrifice of the Son of God for eternal souls of all us sinners, but it is not a document that can be taken word for word as the unvarying decree of the Most High.  I disagree with you that God or His son would object to the marriage of two homosexuals who followed the teachings of Jesus on marriage; where their flesh becomes one, they are devoted to each other, and that they love each other as they love themselves.  Does He find THAT unholy?  Lastly, the Old Testament has some ridiculous inapplicable laws, as I demonstrated in previous posts.  However, the New Testament is not clean of some socially questionable direction as well.  The book of Ephesians says "the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior".  Does this condemn all Christian wives to a life of servitude?  Certainly, with the influence of the Feminine Mystique (this IS a history blog after all), huge amounts of women have become significant breadwinners in the household, is this What Jesus Would have them Do?  I hope I have presented my ideas clearly.  For future reference, marriage is spelled as so, not marrAIge.  God Bless and good night.  Love Rob

      You are certainly welcome Natalya. I'm glad you read what I had to say.  For me, I never trust numbers unless I know the source in which those numbers come from. Who was surveyed? What questions were asked in regards to the survey? There are a lot of ways numbers can be manipulated, which, as a result, can sway the data in a way that supports an idea. I rarely rely on percentages, ratios and what-not unless I know how the data was brought up. For example, I saw on the back of a bus in Portland the other day that read on the rear "249 cars are at home because I am on the road". How do I know they didn't make up the number? Most people who ride the bus don't even own a car! So, by counting the number of people who ride the bus everyday for reliance on the accurancy of that particular data isn't gonna cut it. That is the type of BS statistic that makes me question every form of data I hear, unless I know what the source is. So NPR is going to need to present their resources for their data before I trust what they say.  I have to ask Nat, how is it that you are somewhat religious, but don't even know if religious is real? Interesting. In regards to the bible, those who believe in the judeo-christian religion go by the New Testament, the place where Jesus's teachings are, which is the place where the religion originated. The New Testament is the place where Jesus speaks of homosexuality. And don't call people hypocrites because they don't fast or don't follow the Ten commandments strictly. That is part of the Old Testament. And it seems to me that you think that fasting and ten commandments stuff is all you think the Christian religion is. It seems to me that you're taking the standpoint of christianity very objectively, in which you think that we point fingers at the gay marriage issue and say "you're sinning! you're sinning!". We all know people sin. People who "go by the bible" sin. The Pope has sinned! What I'm saying is, is that as a christian, in regards to the Gay Marriage issue, we're not pointing fingers as to who's a sinner for being gay. It's the fact that those who support gay marraige are trying to take the sacred, holy idea of marraige and turn it into an unholy union. And yes, you may quote me on this is if anyone wants to respond.

      The Tony Awards are tonight at eight! I'm going to watch, I'm excited. Another thing that I'm excited about is amazingly senior project. I really like my topic and I can't wait to do my project. I think Mrs. VA was right when she said that you should do something that is meaningful to you.  OK, college Portfolio questions... It says we need to apply to at least three scholarships. I don't know about other people but I'm having a hard time finding scholarships. All the ones that I want to do the deadlines have already passed. Can we use them for the project even if the deadline has passed? Finally, I saw the Skyview band in the Starlight Parade on TV. It was cool, great job you guys!

      I am not sure if anyone has heard, but former President Ronald Reagan died today from pneumonia due to his Alzheimers disease. I was watching a tribute to him on TV today and learned more about his life than what I learned about his political career from the history books. He was the oldest president to be elected at 69. He also lived longer than any other president. He died at the age of 93 in his home. I guess I never actually realized the major impact that he had on America until I watched his tribute. He was able to bring hope to Americans and bring them to an age that they were able to be happy. I never really knew about him until this year, but I wish that I could have experienced and seen his great presidency in action. It is funny, though, that I never really wanted to learn a whole lot about him, but after his death, he seems intriguing and somewhat of a legend, which makes me want to know more about him and his life. I hope that everyone will at least give there respects to the man who gave so much to our country.

      Yeah Julie for our VA's english classes, there is an AP FEST/PARTY on June 10th from 5:30 to 7:00. We have a committee planning that party and I'm not sure whether those planning people have coordinated the party to include the US history students too.  On the other hand, we have to do something special just for Ms.Clark....Maybe everyone has to sign and write a message on a card or something....As a farewell to all the dedications and years of work she has contributed to Skyview. So maybe we should have a special US history party on a different date.  In the mean time, I have to find those AP FEST committee members........

      Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy everybody. I agree global warming is serious and the open use of chlouroflouro carbons which is a large addition to the problem should be regulated in third world countries. About the movie "The Day after tomorrow"; I went into the movie expecting it to be concerning the effects of global warming but really they just threw watchers some bs about the North Atlantic current shifting and heating things up. They did not address the common problems in the world today that cause global warming. All in all the movie had good special effects and it was cool to see mother nature wreck havoc. Anyway I hope you all have a great weekend.   Chris

      Has anyone seen the new movie The Day After Tomorrow?  I heard it's about the effects of global warming and should be pretty good.  Maybe seeing the moive will motovate some people to help improve conditions before they worsen.  However there will always be people who could care less about the future and do not desire to sell their gas guzzling polution contributing monster vehicles.  Any ways, think about the many ways we can individually contribute to improving our damaged environment and do one thing different for the sake of future generations.  PS: Thanks Thomas for changing the blogger set-up.  It makes it easier to see when I've posted because I forget between my other classes.

      Thank you Mary for providing some good opinion to respond to. As I was reading your post I found my self disagreeing with a couple of statements you made so I had to respond. I just don't see how you can say "I want to take down the idea that right-winged, conservatives aren't open people. DOn't believe that stereotype," when you yourself blatantly state: " Students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way... because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point." Isn't that a major stereotype you just have created yourself? It seems as if you call all the "smart" people boot-lickers who side with the side that their liberal teachers take, that we are not guided by morals in our arguments but only by "data" and scientific experiments. I personally have very strong morals I comply with and I am somewhat religious (if there is such a thing) but I always prove my every argument with "imperical data" just because that's the info that can not be made up and can not be proven wrong or considered opinionated; numbers do not swing either liberal or conservative, they are neutral. What you say about writing papers that teachers like I also consider to be very argumentative, and it of course depends on the school you go to, but the majority of teachers I am sure would prefer you to write a paper that is original in idea and content and shows you to be open-minded thinker.  About abortion, it's great that you have that kind of sense of responsibility for your actions, and I think it's partly because you know that that won't ever happen to you, but we have to remember about all the people that simply do not have that kind of education/surrounding atmosphere/family to support them when they are faced with that kind of choice of either having a child and giving up their future or seeing a doctor for a couple hours and killing that precious spark of life. I still don't know what I would exactly do myself, but I would probably side with you. However I am very strongly for abortion for those who NEED it, or who believe they do.  GM: I don't know how you can tell a gay person that he/she wasn't even "intended" to be alive on this earth, just because it says in the Bible that God did not include gays in his original design. I read the Bible many times and I totally agree with Rob that if we do not follow everything there is written in it, like fasting and strictly following the ten commandments, then why should we tell other people that they don't have the right to marry just because it says so in the Bible. I really think there shouldn't even be such an issue. I want to reference slavery in what Jefferson wrote about the exclusion of Black people from the constitutional definition of "men" just based on the reasoning that Afr. Amer. are "a different species," thus degrading "a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of being which THEIR(?) Creator may perhaps have given them." Maybe gays should be excluded from the ranks of "men"?, they are sort of a different species too...  "We are at war... with terrorism ... racism ... but most of all we are at war with ourselves."

      I too find the impacts of global warming to be frightening.  I dont know how people still deny that it is a real threat.  If anyone wants more information on the topic, check out http://www.ucsusa.org/global_environment/archive/page.cfm?pageID=520  It has a summary of the IPPC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) findings in a recent study.  It also has a link to the origenal report.  I found it to be very informative.  ~Joseph

      Rob, what you will be doing is unprecedented, unique, and first of its kind.(For that matter you can patent this ingenius idea.......JK.....or at the least claiming your originality of that idea as your intellectual property).   But seriously, if I interpreted your message correctly, I think core concept is to get more young people our age involved in politics, the political process, and especially how the political process works in a democratic society - with the funamentals manifested in the act of voting. We all realize the age group of 18-21 represent the lowest percentage of elligible voters that actually vote in an election. For some odd reasons young people our age just does not care about policies of our nation(Heh when there is a draft I bet a lot more people will vote then, but then again it's too late by then).   Youngesters, take your legitmiate part of control over the government!!!!!!!! We do not want the same old/senile/retired generals and shrewd politicians dictate our lives and draft us to be killed in some unknown regions of the world without our consent!!!!!!!!!!  I support the statement that those who do not vote does not deserve complaints.   THUS............GO VOTE, AT ANY OPPORUNITY YOU CAN.......AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION A TASTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS!!!!!!!  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE THROUGH THE ACT OF VOTING!  And finally, do we have an end of year AP Party/Farewell to Ms.CLark Party soon?

      Maybe it's because it's one in the morning, but I had a thought that intrigued me a lot.  I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students— and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body "artistic license" to run the school as it sees fit.  There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option.  In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November.  It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school; a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own.  With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept.  What does everyone think?  I want comments from both students and their parents on this one.  But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone.  (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog).  Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate?  Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this.  May democracy live long and prosper.  Love Rob  P.S.  Create Blogger profiles.  They are kinda fun to do, and they give ME something to look at when I'm up insomniacing.

      Preface:  I know GM is a horse that died a long time ago and we continue to beat it, and for that I apologize, but having just bought a pair of Birkenstocks combined with defense of my weekle Bush mocking, I feel a little offended at Mary's harsh criticism of scientific thinkers.   Mary, I'm not sure I get your stance on gay marriage.  You say you're morally against abortion but you think it should be legal.  Do you have the same position on GM?  I found the arguments you made a little contradictory.    First I want to say that I understand you respect everyone's right to an opinion, that is what you intended isn't it?  But for someone who doesn't want to come off as a right-wing bigot, you kind a come off as a right wing bigot when you challenge "left-wing secularists" who don't reference their morals for forming logical platforms based on fact.  I understand there is a fine line to walk between faith and fact, but I don't think a person has to choose one or the other.  The "smarter people" you refer to have a right to desire evidence to support the belief that God didn't intend homosexual's to marry.  If that evidence comes from the Bible, that is fine, but I guess what I'd like is some flexibility in one's "morals."  I, Left-wing Secularist, read your post and find myself questioning some of your statements you credit to your morality.  I, Left-wing Secularist, would like to know WHY you feel how you feel, where your morals come from, because I feel that I have evidence and "imperical data" to contest the morals you base your argument on.  And I, Left-wing Secularist, feel that I have analiable justification to disregard baseless morals if they don't coincide with mine.  With that said, can you satisfy my curiosity as to why you believe homosexuality is immoral?  I have my own theories, some of which I have expressed, but in the interest of originality, I'll only provide them upon your request.  Long story short, my biggest problem with the argument that homosexuality is immoral (whether right or wrong) is that it means homosexuality is WRONG and homosexuals are WRONG, spawning an attitude that is anti-homosexual which punishes those who had homosexuality thrust upon them whether by biology or development (there are studies that make strong cases for both).  Is that fair?  You say God didn't intend homosexuals to marry, then why were the created?  To be deliberately persecuted by faithful Christians?  Did God intend addiction, physical disability or car accidents?  I don't think that they were spontaneous developments while His holiness stood idly by.  I don't want to question your ideology, maybe just some minor parts, but it's only because I have imperical data from the holiest of books to back me up.  Post on the blog, e-mail me, or talk to me about it because I think it's an important discussion, but know that like Jesus, I'll always love you.  That goes for everyone  Love, Rob  P.S.  Clark's in Atlanta (I don't know why) then Seattle to prep for the next step in her career.  P.P.S  I only pay $6.25 for movies, where the hell is Frank going?

      Global warming is a serious threat and I, like Bethany, am glad to see a new subject on the blog. The amount of damage humans have done, do, and will continue to do to the earth always amazes me. It seems that humans are extremely selfish. If humans continue to plague the earth with pollutants at this rate, it will inevitably lead to destruction of the Earth or the human race, whether it be from depletion of ozone or the melting of the icecaps. It sickens me that although we know this information we continue to pollute and plague the earth.  I also saw the movie Day After Tomorrow and was somewhat dissapointed but it was still an okay movie. I have never really liked Dennis Quaid (I think that is how you spell it), I think he wasn't good for the part. Anyway it's worth the 7.50 to see it. Mr. Parlee is a good teacher. He is very opinionated but, as Ryan and I were talking, we found it somewhat refreshing to hear actual political opinions by someone as educated in history and politics as he is. Usually teachers are hesitant about revealing their opinions because they don't want to offend anyone, but because Mr. Parlee is a substitute he is able to cross those boundries.  Lastly, does anyone know where Clark went? She told us but I forgot.

      Rob, thank you for bringing up a different topic!  It was getting really repetitive in here!  I think that global warming is a really important topic that doesn't get enough credit.  Again, thanks to "the man" for leaving it alone and letting people forget that it does exist and could cause major problems in the future.    One of the issues is that scientists aren't getting funds to research plausible effects of the increase in carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere, which has definitely increased over the last twenty years or so.  Just for everyone's knowledge, the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" is pretty much bogus, in terms of the causes of global warming.  The idea that the actual warming of the world would be immediately followed by a global ice age is pretty unrealistic.  But as long as it reminds people of global warming and the problems that it could eventually create, then I'm all for it!But, anyways, not enough of "the governments" money goes into research for global warming and, while the process is irreversible, it would be worthwhile to research how we could slow down the process that we're now heavily involved in.  However, although the issue seems like it would be pretty un-controversial, there are many scientists who actually believe that global warming is not something that humans cause, that it is simply part of the world turning and getting older.    In the last century on the earth's surface (keep in mind that this is on the ground, not in the actual atmosphere), there have been increases of at three degrees Fahrenheit, which may not sound like much, but it's caused the sea level to rise from six inches to about three feet.  Of course the increase in sea level is caused by ice sheets melting from the increase in temperature.  It's all relevant!!!  And, if these changes had taken place over the last thousand years, it really wouldn't be that big of a deal.  Wow, the earth changes....what a concept!  But the fact that over only 100 years so many changes have taken place...well, it's worth getting into.  You guys, please respond to this one.  It's important, and we need to move on from the gay marriage and abortion topics.  I think that everyone has said what needs to be said, and it's time for something else.  Later!  Bethany

      Hey students...I am settling in and have already started working.  Next week is my third week at Shorecrest.  I hope everyone is having a relaxing summer but I hope you are still all thinking and learning...there is no evidence of this by looking at our blog...did anyone see Farenheit 9-11...?  My new email address is stephanie.clark@shorelineschools.org.  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test.  Remember it is a difficult test and set up so  only 50% of the students paww with a three or better.  In addition only 8% GET A 5.  Also remember only the top scholars in the nation choose to take these tests...so pat yourself on the back for your effort and the amount you learned despite your score or regroup for a better effort next year.   For those of you who did well  and I am sure some of you did congratulations.  Rob-how is the ASB retreat going?  Enjoy the rest of your summer and I hope to hear from some of you.

      I just finished my six weeks of intense math camp.........And a short two and half day ASB Leadership camp!!!!!!!!!! Wow...........Way too much to say............... The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses.  And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.  I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.  Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!  Thomas Chen
