       i need some hog, punark, pum pum, vagina, i'm thinking about settling down with that special piece of fish! Come on ladies, spread out and let me explore you underwater world!  Things slow as rasshole these days though, had a job interview the other day that went pretty well, got called back for a 2nd interview next week, the pay is pretty good so i'm hoping i can get the job to help pay all dem "ladies of the night" i took advantage of! The other day i ran into a girl who claimed she was 2 months pregnant with my baby............. i knew she was lying because i haven't had sex since January of last year.  I can't stand these facting girls anymore, honestly, i think i gon turn a flat out homo and deal strictly wid chi chi men! The other day i was outside the mall chilling, looking pretty good in my red polk-a-dot shirt and yellow pants, obviously i was pimping, a few(and i mean few) young girls were checking me out, one of them finally decided to approach me, she didn't bother introducing herself or anything, just asked me my name, here's how the incident went: Girl says: "hi, what's your name?" I say: "Dick...............Dick Head" Girl says: "Well Dick, you're pretty cute, do you have a car?" I say: "Nope" She says: "well, this was a waste of my time, maybe if you had a car and some money i'd be down with you!"  Hmmmmm, you see how the world has changed people? We men have always been described as "shallow" but look at the women today, they have taken shallow to a whole new level, they aren't even in the swimming pool! These days yuh don't even have to look good, the women only want a man who has money, a car, and plenty credit cards they can borrow, gone are the days when i could ride my bicycle in my dibby dibby bicycle shorts to the corner store knowing fully well that i'd be able to pick up a few ladies on the way!!  Women are now willing to settle for a man who they don't find physically attractive, the man has nothing to offer emotionally, he has no personality, but what he does have is a fat bank book(that is not a reference to his penis)!!  Well i am sick and tired of this shit, girls tell me i'm good looking all the time, well duh, but when i tell dem i ain't got a car they just turn tail and run!!
