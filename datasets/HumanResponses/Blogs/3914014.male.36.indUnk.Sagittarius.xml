      Told Kitten I created a Blog dedicated to her today, and she rang me to tell me it made her cry....and that I got her age wrong (now is that not a typical male thing to do).  Still it was great to know that I can still make her cry one way or another.  xoxoxo

      (Kitten) Is Tamara, a slim dark haired cutie of 27 and mother of 1, and best friend that a guy could ever hope to have.  We first met at work many years ago, and I think that straight away we both enjoyed working together, as time went by and we spent more and more time together, our working relationship grew into something more (LOVE).  Love does strange things to people and, because of this and other factors I won't mention, we are not together.  All I can say is that we do still work together but are in different places, so all the time that we get to spend is over the phone and the net.  I hope that She still knows that she will always be in my heart.  So this is why I've done this little dedication to the best Kitten I know.
