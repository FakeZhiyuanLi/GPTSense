      You know whats the thing i hate about most adults they think there always right. Oh why would u get that get this. No. They ask u what u want and then when u look and find what ur looking for they are like oh why dont u get this it looks better. I mean then why did you ask for my opinion. Second is they always gotta bring u down with whatever u have oh why dont u share oh why dont u save oh why do u alwyas gotta ask for something u want, when i was little i never............ ans stuff like that. I mean we were in different circumstances the time u were in were much more difficult than it is now why do you always gotta take it to the past. And when ur in school and u come home from school and u finish all ur work they want u to do even more work i mean its okay to help  a little but they abuse and give  u a whole bunch of stuff i know the parents are tired but come on why cant u divide the work equally. ANYWAYS..... theres many things that i wanna say but some of those things have to be held inside you until u can talk to someone about(no pschyatrist or psycologist) You have to keep most of ur feelings inside of you because if u let them out they think ur crazy or weird.                                       Um one thing i wanna do, i know i sound like a little kid but i wanna make it to the olympics oneday not because i just saw them but i have a feeling that tells me to go. I wanna participate in them, and i only want to participate in one event , that is soccer. Another thing is i wanna make it to the world cup as a player and i want to go see one werever its held  but thats one of my goals for life to make it to the World Cup FIFA. Soccer is my favorite sport, i like playing it everytime and anytime i can, i like to watch it and play it. This is just a great passion that i have. Another thing is this is a dream that i have had since i was 5yrs old. I always wanted to go to the moon or into space that is one dream that i have had for a long time i have been going at both of these things since i was little. I was playing soccer since i was i can remember i started playing on a team at the age of 4. I dont think i m the best i just think im kinda decent. anyways i got everything i really wanted to say

      Th is Summer has been the greatest of all my summers because i got to go where at first I thought i wouldn't like it. This summer I went to Mexico for two weeks. I went with my mom to visit my Grandmother and to visit both La Virgen De Guadalupe and La Virgen De Juquila. My mom believes alot in these Virgens and so do I so we had to go and pay a visit to them, we had to pray a little while and then we were on our way to the home town of my dad and mom. We took a bus that took 10-12 hours to get there.The town was called Sta. Maria De Zacatepe, Oaxaca. After 2 days of being here i got to get the hang of it. I liked it alot. The first two days i didn't feel like doing anything. I was all sad and depressed because i didnt get to talk to person i wanted to talk to. Then the next day I went to my aunt's house and i hung out with my cousin whose name was Tania. She was my best friend, she was my favorite cousin, she was the person i admired the most. I loved her just as much as my aunt. My aunt was the same. Her name was Coral. She was my favorite aunt, my best friend. I loved both very much. OKay so for the nest 11 days i said i was going to spend it with my aunt or my cousin. MOstly everyday me my uncle and my cousin Andres went to play soccer in the afternoon. Everyday it rained and some of those days we stayed playing even though it was raining. I had dound 4 scars becuase in Mexico there is mostly no grass so that u can play soccer its dirt (tierra). I like the scars they look kind of cool but that is just a weird thing   about me. So in mexico me and my cousin were like if we knew each other for our whole life. For that little time i was there we passed evry single feeling u can think for someone. But out of all feelings we were always happy. We laughed we cried. we yelled at each other, anything u can think of. I saw her cry three times. and she saw me cry once. So we knew each other well. She talked to me when i was crying and i talked to her when she was crying. One of the times that she was crying was because of my fault. First i had gone to her house like at 9:00 in the morning so i spent most of my morning there. We ate and she was cleaning. So we made our own volleyaball court because she had said that she was better than me and that she could beat me. So first game she won and then second game she won. SO then we started to wet each other and had fun like that for like half an hour. Then she said something about me and i was like i dont need u anyways ur not anybody important to me. I was like you could die and it wouldnt matter to me i would bring u a rose and thats it it would be white to.. BUt   everybody knows that i like to play around but my cousin it is, she took it for real (she very sensitive). SO she went by the tank of water and started crying i thought she was faking it. Then i stuck by her all day until she felt better. The funny person that i am i kept making her laugh while she was crying even though she was kinda of mad at me. The next day she wouldnt talk to me and she wouldnt talk to me the next day. She just spent it with my other cousin (he was a boy too) she kept joking around with him and stuff and i think she was trying to make me jealous and it did work. In the end we still talked to each other alot. We spent every afternoon together. We played soccer one game, it was one neighborhood agaisnt another (barrio contra barrio) and our barrio had one and we had bet 20 pesos each person. SO then the girls decided to do a game so so did the little kids. I saw the little kids game it was funnyand i only got to see one game of the girls. I didnt get to see all of it because it was the day i was going to leave. I only saw half of the game and the team that my cousin Tania was on was winning she had scored a goal. My cousin brought out all then pretty girls outside. Three of them were really pretty, i forgot two of their names but i remember one of them. The girl's name was Karen i thought she was the best out of all of them, that is the girl that i gave #10 for a soccer jersey number. (10 to me is the best to me). Oh yeah 4 years ago when i went with my whole family i liked two girls, thier names wer Anita and Annayeli ( i think thats how u spell it) I like Annayeli a little better. SO when I came back this year everybody thought i still like them, Specially my cousin Tania so every time i went to Anita's store evry thought i went to go and see her. Man everyone crazy down there. But annayeli had moved so i didnt really get to see her. Well i had lots of fun down there and i cant wait unti next year so i can go back and have even more fun.

      Getting to start this was very hard because i didnt know how to. actually the steps were easy and i knew how to get in so i tried making an account. Everytime i finished with the first step it asked me to sign in and i tried signing in with the screenname i had just made and it didnt work. so i kept trying new names over and over and over. Soon enough i had found out that an hour had gone by. Since i knew my friend had already made one i asked to make one for me. SO I asked her if she would make one for me and she said yes. Five minutes Later she imed me back and she told me it was done. So she tells me to try signing on with the screenname she made for me and a password she made up. SO i tried and tried and it wouldnt log in. SO i quit. GOt off the computer and went to hang out with my friends. we were sitting at my friends livingroom and i was watching them trying to fix their Playstation2. Then i came back and tried signing on and i finally was able to get on and this is how i got to typing this. Thank you for helping me even though this is a gay screenname.(i know u could of come up with something better
