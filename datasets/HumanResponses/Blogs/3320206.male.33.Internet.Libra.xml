      Well, this weekend did not at all go as expected. But at least it was fun.  Well, the original plan was to go to TMT for a day trip, then go to Sea World on Sunday. Well, that didnÂt happen at all. Phoenix and I decided that it would be more important to go to the Orlando Bird Show on Sat.Andd maybe get a breeding pair of Sun Conures to start our Bird Breeding Project (subsidiary of our Bird Empire Inc.). Well we get to the fair grounds to find that the fair is Sunday only, and its really too late to go to TMT. Well. Not being the kind of folks to go home and pout, we decided to go to Sea World instead.  We got there and decided, instead of buying the Florida Resident fun pass for unlimited entry for the rest of the year for $60, we went ahead and got a couple of silver passes that last till next June for $80. After the day was done, I think it was well worth it. After doing both Epcot and Sea World, I do like the World Showcase at Epcot, but I think I like Sea World as a total experience better. The food prices are amazingly high, but the animals are a lot of fun to take pictures of. I am very proud of Phoenix. After much cajoling and arguing (not to mention calling me some very choice names), Phoenix went with me on the Kracken! I think she screamed the entire time, managed to leave her fingers imprinted on safety bars (thank God it wasnt my leg) and looked like she was about to die (well it looked like that in the picture), but afterward, she said it wasnt so bad and would like to go again! Woo hoot! She is such a trooper!  Well, Sunday we hit the bird show, and wow! It was huge. We found some Sun Conure babies for $130 a piece, but we ended up getting our new little baby grey instead. It was expensive, but the look on Phoenixs face was certainly worth every penny! I love to see her smile. Well, got more pictures coming in (Phoenix is at home photo-shopping them) so I will cut this short.

      Here is a good article following up the draft scare going on... It kinda says not to worry... but believe you me I don't trust anything that Bush could use if he is elected again...  http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/draft.asp

      The carport is clean and organized!  Woo hoo!  	I know it’s not something that is amazing as far as world events are concerned, but hey, now we can fit the jeep completely under it. Tonight’s goal is to clean out the workroom…  	This weekend should be more exciting (I hope). There is the Trimarian Memorial Tournament on Sat. which I am really trying hard to get excited about, but for some reason I really can’t. I want to fight, but I think I’d rather just go fishing, or perhaps taking a walk in the woods taking pictures, or something. I am beginning to look back at my SCA experience as a big waste of time. I do not regret the friends I have made there, or the things I have achieved, but I wonder if I put all the effort into say, making a living at something I like to do, if I would be a more complete person now. Well, no regrets… If I never did SCA, I likely would not have met Phoenix. That and in a month I’ll be all gung ho about it again. So it’s all good.  	The other thing this weekend that I am much more excited about is going to Sea World! I know it must seem odd for an adult to get all excited about it, but, I do have a good time when I go there.  	God I wish I had something more meaningful to say today, but I don’t…   	But I do have a cool link for you: http://www.bloglines.com/ It seems that Blogs are becoming “the thing” and this keeps track of  not only people’s blogs (including mine) but also news sites, etc…

      Rant alert!!!  Well, there is a terrifying bill going through congress… Set to activate after elections… It’s a re-institution of the draft. Not draft registration… THE DRAFT… See the article:  Click on the link in the title to see the article.  "to provide for the common defense by requiring that all young persons [age 18--26] in the United States, including women, perform a period of military service or a period of civilian service in furtherance of the national defense and homeland security, and for other purposes."  This bill is set to activate after the elections, so it doesn’t affect the current establishment’s election bid.  If you never have written your congressman… write now…  I am not effected by this, but we do not need to return to this method of military service when we are doing what we are doing in Iraq. It also provides power to the president to get more troops to invade more countries. Stop this now.  -N

      	Well, last night I managed to get my new shield done. Now if I can only paint it, make my scale armor and pad out my helmet, I might be happy with my armor this weekend. I might make some progress on the scale tonight, or I might not. I would like to try to get that back room clean again and maybe clean out the car port… Cleaning out the car port sounds especially good…  	Well, my lovely Phoenix has started selling bird supplies on e-bay… the beginning of our great bird empire has begun! All part of the great move to Hawaii 5 year plan.  	Plans for this weekend… Well, we are planning to day trip coronation and actually bring Adonis to the festivities, then Sunday go to Sea World and see if we can get those cheap year passes if they are still selling them. More picture opportunities!!! That and I really need a Dolphin fix. It makes me sad to watch them sometimes, but looking in the birthing tank always makes me feel calm.  	I miss my Phoenix. I have been thinking of her all day. I can’t wait to go home and see her.

      What a wonderful weekend! I think that it made up for the horrid week that preceded it.  But now I am bleary eyed and tired, sitting at work suffering, wishing I was home…  Saturday morning we went out to the Sanford Zoo, and despite what other people have told me on how horrid it is, I actually thought it was pretty cool. It’s a low budget operation, but they had a lot of raised wooden trails through the zoo, with a lot of local wildlife as well as the caged denizens. We ended up getting a year membership because it also gives us free admission or discount admission to a bunch of other zoos too. Very cool. Lots of good pictures.   After the zoo, we headed over to the Sanford Flea market, then to Coco beach and got the Tattoo’s we have been wanting (I will post the pictures), then stopped by Martin’s on the way home to wish Heather a happy birthday.  Sunday, we got up and went to Epcot for their flower festival with Martin, Elizabeth and family, then ran over to Port Canaveral and did some fishing (we caught about 12 catfish) and collected shells, ate dinner and came home and took a nice long shower. I must say it was one of the best weekends I’ve had on file… sooo much fun!  However I see already this week is going to be fubar… *Sigh* Well, coronation is next weekend, maybe I wont fight like a goob and have some fun.

      This week has to end... the sooner the better!  It has been so bad its comical.   	It started with some of our schools starting their summer session this last Monday. This means all sorts of students call in because the schools make errors of one sort or another on their accounts... After the day was done, I was so exhausted that all I wanted to do was sit and vegetate that night, having to skip going to Martin’s. Tuesday, one of our campuses networks goes down… IE repeat Monday… Wed… Salt lake has messed up their enrollments, more students get freaked out that they can’t get into their course. Thursday… ahhh… Thursday… That’s the day I was told I am not getting a bonus I earned due to a paperwork technicality, then on the way home I filled my trucks gas tank with diesel… Got Phoenix to come get me, we went off to get a siphon, and proceeded to lock the keys in the car. About 2 hours later, after ingesting diesel, getting it all over my clothing, and finally getting it all out of my tank, we go to Outback to reward Phoenix’s patience and love for me. So now its Friday… I am waiting for today’s shoe to drop… God I hope it all ends today so I can have an enjoyable weekend with my woman. Well at least the mornings have been good. Did I mention I forgot my lunch today?

      Its almost Friday... So bleeding close.    The wonderful thing about using your computer as an alarm clock in the morning, is that you can choose what music to wake up to. After a restful 8 hours of sleep last night (two nights in a row for that... Big change from normal... Something to do with being too exhausted after work to do the things I should be doing, like fighter practice and such) dreaming of parrots and macaws, I woke pleasantly to the lofty strains of "yearning of the sword" from the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon soundtrack. Looking to my right is the most beautiful girl in the world, we embrace, and for a good 45 minutes, life is very good. So good in fact, I skip breakfast. Then the realization that I have to go to work creeps in and I'm all depressed. Soon the weekend will be here, and all will be good :). I hope we get some more good pictures in. We may even get our tattoos done this weekend.  Well enough of this stream of consciousness for now...

      There is just not enough time in the day. I just cant get done what I need to after work. I have been working on Phoenix's armor for weeks now, and hopefully its about done... I think her chin strap needs replacement, but we shall see... At least the rest of the armor is done. Now I am getting into my new stuff, and boy do I have a lot to do. Got my new helmet, but it needs a new chin strap and padding, I need to construct my scale armor, need to finish my new sword and finish my shield... Lots of projects...  *sigh* That and work has been rough for the last few days so its been hard to do anything then sit and zone at home.   But otherwise things are pretty peachy. Phoenix is really an amazing woman and has made my life worth living lately.  So! What to do this weekend? There has been an invite for us to go to Heather's B-Day party, but we shall see... We could go to the beach (either east or west) and go surf fishing... We could go to the zoo and hit the flea market up in Sanford... hmmm... And then there is the tattoo thing that Phoenix and I wanted to do... What to do... What to do...

      Fairly good weekend Phoenix and I decided to go to the Merritt Island Wildlife refuge, and get some very good pictures of the local fauna (which I should be posting later). The place is as idyllic as it sounds, save for the other folks who are there for the weekend. We saw a Bald Eagle, mantissa, gators, turtles, fish, birds, birds and more birds It was quite pleasant to tell the truth. Makes me wish phoenix and I could live a simple life somewhere similar.

        What a night! Went out last night to celebrate Pheonix's new name and she had herself three white russians and a long island ice tea, and I had a frozen screwdriver. Despite the little amount of alcohol that I imbibed, I hurt this morning... I think its something to do with the relative lack of sleep I've had. I just cant got day to day not getting enough sleep. Phoenix thrives on it, but I just cant do it. I could hardly get out of bed this morning. Now I'm all sore and such and waiting for the blessed time when I get home and get to be with my girl. She was wonderful to me this morning getting me juice and cereal. *sigh* what a woman!     Plans for this weekend include, making armor on Sat. then Sunday, we might go to the beach! Sunday is Phoenix's day, and she gets to decide what we do and where we go :).   Ugh... In the meantime I am fighting just staying awake here at work... Thank God its Friday!

         Fighter practice went well last night, if you discount the fact I am fighting like a goob... Boy you take a month or two off, and it all goes to pot. I have a lot to work on... I have bruises on my ribs to prove it! Phoenix however is doing amazingly well. This was the first time she actually got in her armor and fought... despite her cursing that her helmet kept slipping down, she is going to be a terror. Well tonight I will be repairing her bits and pieces and fighting in our back yard... I cant wait till Sat to get my own new armor up.      The news sucks... I am a news fanatic, tuning into CNN every morning, and surfing news on the internet about all day (albeit alot of funny news I read comes from www.fark.com and www.madville.com) and its hard to look at things right now. The Iraqi prisoner abuse, the beheading of that guy in Iraq... I am rarely made sick to the stomach by the news, but lately its been a little hard to take. Well, at least its not like the shock of watching the whole 9/11 thing. I rarely get mad enough to write senators, but the comments made by Republican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma –  "I am also outraged that we have so many humanitarian do-gooders right now crawling all over these prisons looking for human rights violations, while our troops, our heroes are fighting and dying," he said.  "These prisoners, you know they're not there for traffic violations," said Inhofe, whose senatorial Web site describes him as an advocate of "Oklahoma values."  "If they're in cellblock 1-A or 1-B, these prisoners, they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands and here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals."   This inspired me to actually write the senator that our concern over the treatment of prisoners makes us the good guys. I don’t care what they did, our adherence to the Geneva convention makes us a good and decent nation. Otherwise we turn exactly like those we are trying to defeat. Crazy shit. I can’t wait till Bush gets out of office. Did you know Kerry wants to make John McCain Secretary of Defense? A bi-partisan presidency? What a concept!!!

      Have not posted anything on the web for quite awhile. Have not been in the mood really.   What has happened to me since my great adventure to Hawaii? The last six months have been split between me going to a job I cant stand, with short breaks of absolute bliss that I share with phoenix. I am pining for the day we start a business of some sort where we don't have to leave each other to go to work.   What has happened in the last while? Winter, what there was of it has come and gone, and Florida is thriving with life. I absolutely love it. I got to see my first alligator in the wild the other day as Phoenix and I were walking the econ trail, just kinda sitting there on the bank sunning itself. This was to be followed by actually watching an osprey diving into the water to get a fish right in front of me. Amazing.  Went to Gulf Wars this year. Smaller then Pennsic, but my God, do encampments always have to have some sort of drama? Absolutely amazing how good people can have communication issues and its the absolute end of the world. *sigh* Just glad I wasn't involved, when drama hits me, it never seems to be small.   So what else? I hope to start posting some good pictures here of life and times. Phoenix is an outstanding photographer, and has a digital camera, so it should be interesting.            Does Niall look better with a beard?          Yes!         No!         Dont Care...          &nbsp;&nbsp;           urlLink  Free polls from Pollhost.com

        Well, still tweaking this new template and my knowledge of HTML is inadequate. But hey it’s all good. Phoenix and I actually went to Martin’s fighter practice last night and had a good old time. Whacking and getting whacked on by Martin was much fun. Tonight we clean up the parrot’s newspapers, and hopefully do some relaxing. I can’t wait till this weekend and maybe do some fishing!!!    On another note, I really need to get some more music making into my life. There are various folks who keep talking to me about music, and have inspired me to start doing it again. What direction it will take I am not incredibly sure. I could just keep doing SCA Stuff, I could do stuff on my own and say, play at an Irish pub or something, or I could start a band… Anyone out there have any suggestions?

      I need a makeover.   Occasionally I look at my life and want to change some things, and I am on the edge of that now.   I think the main change will be my hair. For those of you who know me, I have hair down to the small of my back… and its driving me absolutely insane. I have given Phoenix carte blanche to decide what my hair will be like, because I really don’t care, as long as it’s no longer long… I could be bald for all I care at this point… I think high and tight and spiky, perhaps with blond tips may be what are in Phoenix’s plans, but we shall see. It seems that I have to visit her hairdresser and she is in high demand…  I think I will be riding my bike again… I miss it.  I now have a mustache and goatee; I think I’ll keep those… if I don’t pluck them out in fits of stress. ( I think Phoenix will hit me next time she sees me plucking at them, it reminds her too much of our birds plucking feathers)  I think I want to sing folk songs again… I will have to get my guitar strung up again and try it.  I want to live in Hawaii… I really do… working on that one.  I want to take more walks in the woods with Phoenix, looking for birds.  I want to go Kayaking on the ocean with Phoenix. (and fish!)  I want to wear more cargo pants, with pockets for everything, and find more cool Hawaiian shirts.   I want, I want, I want. Oi!

      This weekend was a mixed bag. I have to admit, I will never ever desire or become a pelican, and likely I will never get a service award, because frankly, I only do tedious outstanding service  like being troll all day, when I am suckered into it (I have no problem helping out with stuff in general but that's different). The one thing I am impressed about though is the very careful handling of the money once I was through with it. It took three people to count and recount it all, and it was all put in special bags and I was given a receipt, releasing me from responsibility from it. The pains of past problems has made the process very persnickety.     Besides having my tail glued to my chair for about 9 hours, the event went off reasonably well. The event was pretty well run, but I would like to make a comment, and in no way does this reflect on Carla, or any of the staff, or anyone else for that matter. It just diademt seem like a Known World Event . It seemed like any other SAC University I have been to. I guess all the conflicts, and lack of interest made it that way. But for what it was, it was pretty cool.      After the event, I went home and spend the rest of the day with my sweetie and da birds. Sunday we went to the Sanford flea market and stopped by the Audubon birds of prey sanctuary, which was quite impressive. They are a heal and release group, except for the ones that are permanently damaged. Their facilities were quite impressive, including a flight barn for retraining the birds to fly. Very cool.

      Bird, bird, bird, bird is the word:  Well, here is a bird update:  Well our flock is doing ok; we have had some minor victories and defeats.  Addicus, the most care intensive seems to be doing well. We have added 3 shredded shirts to his cage and put up a roll of register tape, and he seems to love both. He seems to be picking less, though he is a big baby. Whenever we leave the room for a moment, he is screaming, but that is to be expected. He is getting more familiar with us, letting down his hair so to speak, and having fun dancing and laughing and such. The bad side of it is that he is getting a little biteier. Just this morning as I was putting him away, he bit my thumb hard enough to make me bleed. I have got to get that squirt bottle out and use it more. The other good news is that he is eating more, although not any one thing consistently. Picky picky picky.  Mrs. Zorah is flying now, and has picked up the habit of flying onto poor Adonis’s cage, because it is fare more interesting then hers, much to Adonis’s chagrin. He seems irritated about it sometimes, but she is now as big as he is (and she’s a Timneh… goes to show what a runt he is of a Congo) and he tends to back down when she asserts herself. Otherwise we are down to one hand feeding a day and she is eating her own food like mad. Its about time to get her own full size cage, probably next month when more money comes in.  Buddi is not doing much. He is eating like a pig, and most anything we give him. He is not incredibly social, but he talks quite a bit. Found an interesting behavioral quirk that he has the other day. When I bring my magnetic security card near him, he follows it around like a zombie… when I stop it, he will actually let me scratch his neck, but prefers the card scratching his neck even more. We tried this with some other magnets, and it worked just as well. We went ahead and got him a magnetic perch and he loves it. Sometimes he will just go in his cage and hang out on it.  Adonis is the one having problems right now. With all the new birds in the house, he is a bit stressed and has started clipping again. We paid lots of attention to him last night and he seemed to have a good time (he is the talker with the most vocabulary so far) so we are watching him as much as we can. We have put some rags and extra toys in his cage, and hopefully it will help.  Well, still need some Congo females and a male Timneh… egad. I cant imagine the ruckus with 6 or 7 birds total. Not to mention all the babies!

      Sorry I have been quiet for a few days, been busy… Or lazy, or something…    This weekend was quite a lot of fun. Saturday was a shopping day, and we picked up a cheap surf casting rod, and Sunday we went fishing out by New Smyrna Beach. Now mind you it was more of an exercise in getting wet and having fun then serious fishing. Not knowing exactly where to go to fish exactly, we tried it some on the main beach, and then we headed out closer to the jetties where we heard the fish were biting.    I have to admit, that New Smyrna beach overall is one of the flattest places I have ever tried to fish on the beach. No sandbar to cast to, no nothing, just plain flat hard compact sand. So we went in about waist deep (with the occasional wave smacking us head high) and had a ball just trying to stand up and hook bait. There seemed to be a lot of bites, but not a lot of catching at first. We bought some of those new “blood hooks” (i.e. red plated hooks) some G’s and some normal. The G’s were a bit too big for what was biting, but I did catch a small shark (about a foot long or so). We switched to the smaller hooks and Phoenix caught a small whiting and I caught a spot. Nothing amazing, but we had a lot of fun doing it. We were thrown out of the water (well I take that back, when we changed locations, we couldn’t go in) because there were thunderstorms raging in the area (it was raining, but hey we were wet already…) On the way to the jetty, we spotted a huge tortuous at the part we had to go though (well about 3 foot diameter.. not huge, but bigger then I have ever seen in the wild). The lightning was spectacular, but little did I know the show I would get later would be even better.     Eventually we petered out and Phoenix’s Catheter for her insulin pump slipped out into the water. Yipe! No back up, so it was time to go home ASAP. We figured that she would be fine as long as she didn’t get stressed about it on the way home, giving her a high blood sugar. Well, here we are sprinting on I-4, when we run into a wall of water. If it was any harder, it would have been sheets instead of raindrops. The lighting was hitting on either side of the road less then a mile away from us or so, and hitting every 30 seconds. Did I mention Phoenix is freaked out by lightning… as well as slow drivers? Well it petered out a bit, then hit us just as hard again about 5 minutes later, and poor Phoenix was in tears. Well, we got through it, and after it all, Phoenix pipes up with “Hey! That was fun!” I had to laugh. Kind of like that time she had her first ride on the Kracken at Sea World, she almost had a panic attack in line, screamed her head off in the ride, and thought it was great afterwards. She is so much fun to be with! *grin*    Well, we made it home safe, and this week is another week. KWAS is this weekend, and I am still not sure what I need to do, if anything, if I even need to show up etc. I guess I should call Carla. I am reservationists after all (well the figurehead… not that we have had many reservations).   As a known world event, I think this is going to be a bomb ( less then 25 reservations), but as a collegium, I think it will be fine.

I figure all the aol ones are my favorite aunt, Aunt Dean, but the rest are too general to figure out. I am not getting any comments (well I got one from a cool parrot breeder who was asking about Buddi) so I must not be that interesting Maybe I need to put more gossip on my page If you like a post, or want to comment on a post, click on comments!

      Well, what has been going on lately?    Well its been raining quite a bit lately, and of course I love it! Florida rain has the wonderful quality of having that tropical feel to it, meaning really big raindrops coming straight down hard. Not to mention the firework show that we get with each storm. It is so awe inspiring for me to look up and see the boiling of the sky before a storm. I really should have taken Meteorology in college instead of Anthropology. It would have been much cooler to be a storm chaser. Oh well, maybe next lifetime   The birds have been doing fairly well. Addicus is plucking less, Buddi has turned into a little piggy eating lots of routybush, Adonis is a little less sulky, and Zorah is turning into a beautiful little girl. She is now stepping up on her own and is only getting handfed twice a day. She is doing her flapping exercises and she is so dark, she almost looks like a little hawk Very cool. Addicus is very amusing, but Zorah is capturing my heart. I really dont want to clip her because a whole bird is a happy bird But there is the danger of her flying away Well, I might try to find a harness for her 	What else is going on? Might go fishing this weekend Definitely need to get the Jeeps brakes looked at as they are squeaking. Want to go camping, but its hard when you have kids *grin*. We definitely need to find a good babysitter. 	Did I mention how cool Phoenix is? She feeds all these monsters!

      Well, today has been a Friday that has dragged on and on...  Well, Addicus the Cockatoo is a very cuddly odd little bird... Wont eat as much as we would like, but at least he is plucking less then he was. He is overall a very sweet bird. We think we got an age for him of 8 years old. He has the cutest little happy dance, it is sooooo funny! He has shown signs of being a typical three year old... when we leave the room for over five minutes, he does that ear piercing Cockatoo scream that sounds like he is being eaten by a hawk... It scared the pants off of Phoenix when she first heard it, but luckily I had been warned about that. I cant wait till his feathers come back, he is going to be such a pretty bird in about a year or so... Buddi is also opening up alot. He is talking a lot more, and stealing all of Adonis's repetoire. Zorah is looking beautifull! She is beginning to do flap practice and all her feathers are coming in. She is a sexy little bird. We are down to two feedings a day with her now, as she is refusing formula... She is digging into the pellets, so I dont think weaning is going to be that big of a deal.

      The right wing is the one true God, and Ronald Reagan is his prophet…  Ok, not really. Looking back at Reagan’s policies, they actually are more moderate then you might think… While he did great tax cuts for folks like you and me, he raised corporate taxes to the highest level in history, He saved social security (which the current group of Republicans are trying to destroy) and while he was against abortion rights, he never actually did anything about it.  But that’s not what inspired my title. This morning on the news, I saw something eerie… There was Reagan’s casket, covered in an American flag, surrounded by flowers, and people viewed the casket by walking in two circles around the perimeter of the room. It reminded me of Muslims circling around the tomb of Mohammed on haj. What odd symbolism we have considering the times…

      Well, being the web maniac that I am, I searched for some more info that we need to rehab this cockatoo... egad, I didn't know these birds were so hard to keep! But its all good... We just need to put a lot of TLC on this bird. There is a great site http://www.mytoos.com/  that goes over all the disadvantages to having a Cockatoo own you... *sigh* I think we have all the requirements except the unhand cash... I am not sure breeding Cockatoos is ethically sound given that they are so easily messed up. I suppose it might be, but I would think that as a breeder, one would make sure that the person buying the bird has the time, money, space and desire to care for such a wonderful bird. Well... Now I am thinking that converting the sun room into an aviary might not be such a bad idea. But we need a shed for all the stuff in the back room! LOL... work work work work....

      Well, yesterday we got our first real project bird, and his name is Addicus (see picture below). Its this sort of thing that really breaks my heart. He is the sweetest bird I have ever encountered, but he is so torn up it almost brings you to tears. Its not just the picking (or the shock of seeing one of his flight feathers fall off spontaniously), but despite being one of the biggest umbrella cockatoos I have ever seen, he is as thin as a rail. He seems happy now, but the poor thing is still picking, and is not eating. He was eating seed at the store, so we mixed in seed and routybush (along with all the other goodies we feed the rest of the birds: carrots, broccoli, grapes, apples, etc.) but the only thing we have seen him eat is watermelon and cheese (*sigh* sounds like my college days). Needless to say we are a bit worried, and a trip to the vet is in the future, but we got to get him eating now. Phoenix is going to try to talk to the previous owner to see what he will eat, and going to get some proper cockatoo food (Larger pellets I guess…) If not , Phoenix may start hand feeding baby formula to him.   Otherwise, he is happy… He was up on the perch with wings spread last night dancing back and forth chirping away… what a sweetheart. I hope he likes his new home!

      A lovely weekend! Just lovely!  Had a very nice weekend this past few days. We didn’t actually do a lot, some housecleaning and such, but mostly getting used to our new African Grey Buddi. The background on this bird is quite sketchy, but he is a cool bird none the less. It came about that Phoenix got this bird from its owner because the owner got a job traveling and just didn’t have time to spend with him, so he ended up at the shop being kenneled more then not. In a fit of guilt, the owner asked Phoenix if she would take him, and Phoenix said heck ya! (Well ok, it was approximately something like that). The former owner said that the bird was four years old or so, but she found the bird walking down the road one day, so we expect he is quite older. He is much bigger then Adonis, and has an odd beak (looks like the nose on a mob thug in my opinion) He was on an all seed diet, so his feathers (as you can see in the photo) are a bit worn and yucky, but we are getting him on routybush and going to be giving him Vitamin supplement. The big news this weekend is that we are going to be getting another bird from the boarding room, a huge (and I mean huge for even this bird) Umbrella Cockatoo. He has been in the back of the store, and has plucked all his feathers except down and head feathers. We are going to pick him up today, along with a new cage or two, a huge one for him and a larger cage for Buddi. We will have to get one for Zorah eventually, but not for another month or so. (Cages are expensive! What a racket! Even making them out of wire myself isn’t as cheap as it should be!)  Speaking of cages, we were kicking around an idea for a bird boarding business… Need a lot more cages for that!  Birds birds birds birds! OY!  Stopped by Martin’s late Sat. and helped him put together his spiff new all oak bar table… (very nice), hit the flea market looking for deals (seedless watermelon for $1.50 was this week’s find) completely revamped the bird room and the living room to make more room for more cages, put collars on our cats and introduced them to the great outdoors (talk about freaked out cats! But hey, there are too many birds around for them to be underfoot). Watched Master and Commander on TV, and of course Law and Order once or twice   Not a bad weekend at all…

      Boy yesterday really sucked. We hit our record at work in taking calls. We were over 500 by the time I left and boy I was burned out. I have been getting headaches lately at work, probably eye strain. Maybe Ill start staring at the keyboard more *grin* It is nice going home to my Phoenix at least.  Tried to feed the little bird last night again and boy I suck at feeding birds. I managed to get her fed, but it seems that I am too slow in getting it down her throat, and I don’t hold her right, etc. Maybe I will just clean up the cage and let Phoenix do the feedings… I hope we can get some breeders so we can start selling birds.  One of the things I didn’t like about the bird show, is that there are so many breeders that dont seem to be doing things right. There are the obviously abusive ones (one poor macaw was screaming the whole day, freaked out of its mind because the breeder was so bad in raising the thing) but even some of the more well meaning ones were not quite on the ball. The bird we got, the breeder was only feeding 30cc of food 3 times a day. We continued on this course, and the poor thing was starving. We looked up feeding for African Greys, and they suggested 5 feedings a day at her age! Oy!  Well it makes it now we cant leave the house to do anything without bringing the baby, so we are pretty much stuck at home for the next month or so (unless we bring the baby) I guess this is practice for a real baby someday.   On other news, I hear my ex (stitch) has gone absolutely loonie…

      Weekend plans…   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday is kingdom war practice, and I do want to go this time. I want to get my new chest plate done before hand. So Saturday may be a quick trip to Sea World in the morning, and spend the rest of the day cleaning out the bird cages and working on armor.   However blowing it all off to go fishing would be very nice.   &nbsp;  Well, the U.S., as is usual, is finally calling what’s going on in the Sudan genocide, and is slowly gearing up the U.N. to condemn it. Like that’s going to do anything in the short term, or save lives. The reports from there are terrifying, people getting slaughtered, women and children raped while the Arab women sing in support if it while it happens. Very sad situation if you ask me, to bad Bush didn’t do any “pre-emptive” measures there…   *sigh*

      Well, the DNC is in full spring, and boy I am so excited----- NOT!  Rant alert!  I wish my party would be a little more exciting. Or make a platform that was a little more what I want to see, but I think that would be difficult. Pro – Choice, Pro-Gun, Pro-Environment, Anti-oil, Pro-gay marriage (geeze man, can’t government just leave these folks alone?), Pro- space exploration, Pro-stem cell research, Pro-genetic mods (but with careful regulation on environmental effects),&nbsp; Pro-corporate regulation, Pro-Political Funding reform, Anti – whaling, Anti – Bush, pro-fiscal responsibility, pro- getting our troops home from Iraq, etc…  And well the only thing I see from the democrats these days is the Anti – Bush part, for certain. I swear, I like some of the republican ideals, like some of what John McCain has to say, but my God, the Bush white house is crazy! *sigh* I think I am more anti-neo conservative the anti Republican. If you look at it in a certain light, Bush is the most Liberal president we have had in quite some time. Here is the definition of Conservatism out of Webster’s dictionary:  a : a disposition in politics to preserve what is established b : a political philosophy based on tradition and social stability, stressing established institutions, and preferring gradual development to abrupt change  So, what part of this does Bush Jr do? Pre-emptive military strikes are certainly not a conservative way of thinking, containment is. The patriot act is certainly not “preserving” our rights as citizens. He wants to change Social Security, a huge established institution. Environmental protection has been a stressed since Nixon, (a Republican by the way) and he has done more to dismantle environmental regulation then any president this century! Ok, ok… deceiving the public is certainly a well established institution, so in that way, I’ll give him points. So is being owned by corporate interests.  Bush – Right wing Liberal…  Enough of ranting…  I am all ready for practice tonight. I got my new helmet all padded up, and took the chain off, and it is way spiff. It’s so light I am not going to know what to do with myself! And as soon as I get the scale done, I am going to have quite the spiff harness. I hope I can get it done by the next event. That and get in shape to kick some tail.  Well, back to work for me…

         Go see the Bourne Supremacy. You’ll like it. It is even better then the first movie.             Well, the wheel spins round, and I’m interested in astrology again. Go fig.             Got the house cleaned this weekend (well   Phoenix   got the house cleaned… I cleaned the birds room) , went to Martian’s daughter’s birthday party.             That’s about at really. More as it happens.

      It’s Friday! Yes it’s Friday!  Hootie hoo!!!!!  And it’s again too busy here at work to be Friday. People need to not worry so much on Friday and leave it till Monday!  But it’s all good. Soon I will be out of here and into the arms of my lady love. Tonight, I think we will go see the Bourne Supremacy. I loved the Bourne Identity, and I have high hopes for this one as well. As far as this weekend is concerned, we are going to do some house cleanup, and I think we are going to check out the Sanford flea market again. The Sanford flea market is interesting, but every time we go, we kind of haphazardly meander, which is very much against my shopping grain. This time, Phoenix suggested we do a systematic search of the place, covering every single spot. Whoo hoo! Says I!  As far as the house clean up is concerned, I am hoping to find more interesting things to sell on ebay for the great Hawaii trip, and finish my scale armor and pad my helmet. Not to mention clearing up the slow shower drain problem, mop the floors, and maybe even clean out my closet.  Or a nice mid day nap might be in order too.  Sunday we have gotten an invite to go to the Dolphin Hotel at Disney for drinks. I like that idea too!!!

      Last night, after putting the birds to bed, Phoenix and I went out to Lake Eola and walked arm in arm around the lake. Of all the cities I have lived in, I must admit that Orlando’s downtown area is really one of the best. Its clean, there are a lot of cool clubs, restaurants and shops to go in, and the town is really fairly pretty. Well, as I said, we walked around the lake arm in arm and taking pictures along the way of the fountain, the swans, and the impromptu drum session that was going on in one corner of the park. I hope to post them tonight. I like Orlando. I really do. The only part I don’t like is all the pan handlers in town, but it is an American city, that is to be expected.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was good to be with Phoenix and see her smile. There are few things that make me happy in this world, and that is one of them. We walked around town a bit and stopped by the Public Library, where they have a light sculpture where you can hit buttons and make the lights light up and musical tones ring. If you hit the right combination, the whole thing freaks out and flashes and sings and makes quite a spectacle. I love it. So did Phoenix, smiling like a little girl and clapping when it happens. It is funny how such simple little things can make you happy. Watching her experience something new (like that), when her eyes light up and she smiles, it almost makes me cry with joy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The birds are doing fine. Not much to say about them really. Zora has taken a taste for milk and keeps trying to hijack it from my morning cereal (at the same time Addicus tries to grab the cereal itself). Everyone is getting very talkative to each other, but the actual verbalization of human words is way outnumbered by chirps and whistles and cell phone impersonations. Oh yea, I forgot. Addicus has taken to humping your hand… figures, the one we don’t want to breed is the most randy.

      Johnnie Cochran:   Ladies and gentlemen of the supposed jury, I have one final thing I want you to consider: (pulling down a diagram of Chewie) this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk, but Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now, think about that. That does not make sense! (jury looks shocked)  Why would a Wookiee -- an eight foot tall Wookiee -- want to live on Endor with a bunch of two foot tall Ewoks? That does not make sense!  But more importantly, you have to ask yourself: what does that have to do with this case? (calmly) Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense!  Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense. None of this makes sense.  And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense.  It does not make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!  (pulling a monkey out of his pocket) Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey! (one of the juror's heads explodes)

      First the bad. Today it was brought to my attention that one of the desktop support managers at one of the schools we serve&nbsp;was unhappy that I sent in a ticket without enough detail:  (user)Can’t get computer to start up, IT takes forever to boot, then hangs up.  &nbsp;  The desktop manager at the school could not decipher this simple sentence fragment. Now I will admit I made a typo capitalizing both letters in “it”, which this person interpreted that there is something wrong with the IT dept. Then in his infinite wisdom, he interpreted the last part was&nbsp;that the modem hangs up, instead of the computer locking up. I know this individual is getting paid more then I am, again convincing me that with exceptions (like my boss Todd, my God, that guy knows everything {and I am not brown nosing here, he never reads this blog}) that the less you actually know about what you are doing in IT, the higher position you are likely to hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The good news is that I took more calls then everyone else here in June. Go me! Don’t applaud, just throw money.  &nbsp;  Well, its back to surfing. Got to find a funny picture for today.

      Well, today is Bagle virus day. It seems there is another virus in the wild affecting computers, making my life more difficult. I do wish they would come up with more spectacular names for virii, like say, “silicon death adder”, or say “Microsoftbane”. It would be better then something I want to spread cream cheese or lox on. Well yesterday, I had more hits to this silly blog then I have had in a while (12 hits yesterday!), and I would like to thank all of you who read my weblog for making this such a wonderful success (sniff… sniff…) I love you guys!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another update on “how to get to Niall’s blog”. Another anonymous user has blundered their way onto the site by going through MSN search and inputting “armor plated catfish pictures florida”. I don’t know why, but my blog has gotten quite a bit of attention in the search engines, many times putting me on the first page for some really strange searches. Well, I guess I can’t complain.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, what is on the agenda for this week? I hope to actually start posting some songs with some sound bytes connected to them (I think I will start with Peasant Knight), fighter practice tonight, and need to determine what to do this weekend.

       Well, this weekend was a lot of fun, till Sunday arrived.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phoenix and I decided to try a new spot out to go catching (yes this time it was catching, not just fishing), at the Canaveral National Seashore, and wow! What a great beach! Not an amazing amount of people there, nice weather, nice beach, nice waves, very cool. We woke up stupid early, and got out there by about 7:30am and caught a good picture of the sun over the water. We planted our poles and chairs, dug up some sand fleas and a few minnows with the cast net, and proceeded to get a nice tan and enjoy the day. We caught 3 whiting and a catfish during the day, but the bad news was that when we took a lunch break, we went to Subway (did I mention that Phoenix is getting addicted to subway), and our tackle box was either lost or stolen, which was a bummer, but we had enough to keep fishing, and we went out had had fun playing in the waves (the water was amazingly nice and cool). Rain came into the picture right after lunch, and poured all around us, but did not hit us directly. It was amazing, you could see the launch towers from Canaveral, but when the rain came, one of them disappeared! But we were blessed with good weather, and caught&nbsp;4 fish, three whiting and one catfish.&nbsp;I can’t wait to go again next time!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday on the other hand was miserable. Somehow my back got out of whack on Saturday, and I was in pain and bed bound on Sunday. I got all drugged up, which was almost as bad as the pain, and had pretty much a terrible day. Phoenix was a darling and helped me through the day and cleaned up after the birds all on her own. &nbsp; Well on to the pictures!

      Not enough people covering here at work, so it makes for an unpleasant stressful Friday, but hey what can you do. Tomorrow at this time, I will be on the beach in the sun trying my best to catch a fish or two, waist deep in the water having a ball.  &nbsp;  Found something disturbing on my blog webstats the other day, and I cant stop thinking about it for some reason. Someone came to visit my weblog through doing the following search on yahoo: “how do I buy a live dolphin”. &nbsp;I wonder why this person wants a live dolphin? Are they mad, or just stupid? Oh well, I don’t think I will ever know.  &nbsp;  I have been adding links from funny news and things I find on the web, and I hope this amuses folks, because it certainly amuses me! And I like sharing a laugh or two.  &nbsp;  Well, I will try to find another template I like and get it posted, so people can leave better comments to my posts then just the tag board. Not to mention I am bored of this one already.  &nbsp;  Well, back to work!

       I found a funny write up today about the DNC and a Sci Fi con, both going on in Boston:    &nbsp;  &nbsp;This year's World Science Fiction Convention is in Boston, and accordingly, the URL for the con is boston2004.com. By a funny coincidence, the Democratic National Convention is also in Boston, and its URL is boston04.com. The inevitable confusion is quite humorous -- the organisers of the WorldCon have compiled a list of ways in which the WorldCon is unlike the DNC:     # We're not $10 million over budget. We don't even have a $10 million budget.   # Our promises for the future are supposed to be fiction.   # You don't have to donate thousands of dollars to us (though we wouldn't complain)—we'll give you a high-level appointment to work for us for free!   # The media will not outnumber the attendees.   # Thoats and banthas are more interesting animals than donkeys and elephants.   # The folks wandering around with walkie-talkies are likely to be helpful and friendly.   # The slogans on our buttons are actually funny, and many of them are about cats.   # No one will be kissing babies except their immediate families and friends.   # When we talk about "skull and bones" it's probably in a discussion about paleontology.   # When we sling mud, it's probably in a workshop on making alien pottery.

      Boring boring day.  Work is slow, news is slow, and I am bored out of my freaking gourd. A co worker of mine got mildly miffed on her blog at the fact that I sound like a five year old on the phone when I talk to Phoenix with all the lovey dovey stuff, admonishing me to grow up and not be so co-dependant. It actually got me thinking about it… for about 3 seconds before I guffawed in laughter. Better co-dependant, in love and sickeningly sweet then unhappy and lonely I say! I have to admit, I am a much happier man with Phoenix then without, and I plan to keep it that way (figuring I am going to marry her after all!)   Speaking of having fun, I am still trying to determine where to go fishing this weekend. Phoenix wants to try somewhere else besides New Smyrna, and I am thinking that the Canaveral seashore might be the place to go. Anything to get away from the typical crowds we keep running into. I just need to find a bait shop nearby!

      Fighter practice at Martins last night went very well. I was sad that Phoenix couldn’t make it, but I had much fun. Most fun fighting I have had in some time. Martin taught me how to fight like Michael of Bedford, and wow does it work well for me! I cant wait to fight again! Otherwise I am too exhausted (no sleep) to do a decent post today, or for that matter do my job correctly. Plans for this weekend include more surf fishing, Phoenix cant get enough of it, and I am happy to oblige.

      Whew. keep trying to make the better template. keep failing miserably!  Back to my old back up, the mermaid one was too risqué for folks at work. I worked on another one, but the preview and the actual blog never matched.   But in other news, I ASKED PHOENIX TO MARRY ME!  And she said yes! Which has made me very happy of course (and her *grin*)  It is going to be a long engagement, for we want to get married in Hawaii, the plan being this December.  I’ll try to describe this weekend as best I can. There was a lot that happened.  On Friday, finally the ring came in the mail. Thank God. I swore that Phoenix was going to figure out what was going on when I had this ring box like object in my pants pocket, but she didnt. That Friday we went out and saw King Authur, which was quite a good movie. Not spectacular, but very good. I like how they dressed the Saxons. I didnt like that fact that the Saxons had crossbows, not that they could hit anybody with them anyway. Next morning we went first to the flea market (and got me a pair of sunglasses) and then out to Liu Gardens. What a perfect place to ask someone to marry them! Actually as we were going in, a group of people were leaving who had just been married! Phoenix was saying how cool that was, and I just had to grin. We walked through the gardens, and it is amazing in Florida, that when you set up a place for wildlife, the wildlife come to you. There were amazing plants all around, but also some very cool animals. Our first encounter was a snake fishing for minnows in one of the small ponds. We walked from garden to garden and finally we stumbled into this beautiful area with a stained glass arboretum, surrounded by flowers. Just beyond it was an oval grass covered field where we took off our shoes to feel the grass under our feet. I decided that this would be the perfect place. I grabbed her, asked her if she would love me forever, she said yes, then I asked her if so, would she marry me. She said yes and started crying with a huge smile on her face. I then got a picture to remember it all just as it was.    We continued though the garden, and true to form, as always with Phoenix, she called a bird to come as a good omen. A huge owl flew in front of us and landed in a tree above us, giving us a nice pose to boot. Got me a good picture too! The rest of the gardens were truly spectacular, with exotic flora and nice shady groves with benches to sit in the heat. We left there grinning like Cheshire cats. Then we went and celebrated at the cheesecake factory, with a piece of vanilla bean cheesecake and a daiquiri (well I had a daiquiri, Phoenix had something called a “twilight zone”) and then went and saw Spiderman 2. I loved the action, I loved Doc Oc, I didnt like Peter Parkers silly wishy washy romantic and personal confliction in the movie, it was boring, drawn out and overdone. I wish they could have managed to say what they were trying to say in a more powerful and condensed way and cut a half hour out of the movie, or added more action. Well anyway, it was good overall.  	Sunday we cleaned cages, went grocery shopping and generally just hung out (and well, never mind). It was raining most the day anyway. But we were happy and content with the world.

      And here we go with yet another template, till I get sick of it (which may be tomorrow!) I am not sure I like this one either, its too light for my taste, but I do like the mermaid (although she is a bit risqué), and its got enough of a water theme for my tastes. One of these days I will make one from scratch and do it how I like (when I learn HTML for real that is)  Well, what is on the list of things? We had the chance to take two more cockatoos, who are in really good shape, only a year old, brother and sister, but there is no way. One cockatoo is a handful, two more would be insane, not to mention that we would have to buy another $200 cage. We could have gotten them to use as breeders, but we have decided that breeding cockatoos would raise too many ethical questions for us. They are so needy, that selling them to a bad household, no matter how well meaning, would be a moral crime to me, especially when there are so many in rescue that should be adopted into good homes instead. However if a female African Grey came up, I think we would snatch them up in a heartbeat to start the breeding business.  Speaking of our birds, here is a progress report for them:  Addicus is doing as well as can be expected. Despite a lot of toys, a huge cage, and all the TLC we can give, he is still picking at his feathers. He seems happy, we play with him, he does his happy dance a lot, and he is leaning new words, but we just can’t seem to stop him from picking. Now mind you he is picking a lot less, but we noticed tips from normal feathers on the bottom of his cage, instead of just down. I am worried about him. I hope we can figure out a way to stop it. I may need to make him a cloak or get him a Elizabethan collar.  Zora has turned into that little girl that is always inquisitive, loves running around, is constantly in your face, wants everything you are eating, and throws temper tantrums when ever she doesn’t get what she wants. Otherwise she is a sweetie! Her and Addicus buddy buddy up to each other quite a bit, and are becoming pretty good friends, which is a good thing because the other two grays are scared of her. The morning habit now is that when I sit down for my morning bowl of cereal, I get mugged by Addicus and Zora, with Atticus going for the cereal, and Zora landing on my spoon and trying to get at the milk. It’s like living with seagulls *grin*.  Its time I taught Zora a little manners with a squirt bottle, starting tomorrow.  Adonis is plucking feathers. He is still stressed out about all the new birds, but we expect that to calm down eventually. He is also being a bit antisocial, but we are starting to drag him to play with the rest of the flock when we are all together.  Buddy is buddy. No plucking, eats like a horse, but doesnt really like being handled much, unless you have a magnet in your hand (weird bird). He stays in his cage a lot even though open his cage whenever we are home. He talks a lot too.  In other news, went to practice on Tuesday at Martins and spent the whole time fixing Phoenixs helmet. Martin was going over drills for sword leg lead options, and gave me some ideas to try next time I fight him. Otherwise, Phoenix and I have been just hanging out, conserving money (because we don’t have much at the moment) and being happy. How is everyone out there? Leave a tag on my tag board, let me know!!!

      Ok, those of you who know me, know I'm a liberal Democrat, and I just have to share this joke with all of you.  A woman in a hot air balloon realized she was lost. She lowered her altitude and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, "Excuse me, can you help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't know where I am."  The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level.  You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west longitude.     She rolled her eyes and said, "You must be a Democrat. " I am," replied the man. "How did you know?”     "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to do with your information, and I'm still lost. Frankly, you've not been much help to me."   The man smiled and responded, "You must be a Republican."  "I am," replied the balloonist. "How did you know?"  "Well," said the man, "you don't know where you are or where you're going. You've risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You're in exactly the same position you were in before we met but, somehow, now it's my fault."

      What a great weekend!    As you can see by the pictures below, we did some fishing on Saturday, and when I say fishing, I do mean it… there was very little catching involved. Still, it was a good time. We fished off the jetty near the lighthouse in New Smyrna, but every time I cast, I got snagged on the rocks. Phoenix on the other hand had a wonderful time climbing on the rocks and looking at the crabs and barnacles, and even scratched herself a little. She is so much fun to watch. She has missed out on so much in life, that when I show her something new, she is like a little girl discovering a treasure. I can’t wait to bring her to Hawaii, she’ll go nuts!   So after hauling all the equipment back from the jetty, we headed out and stopped at that little park as shown in the pictures below. I think if we go camping down on the coast, we may go there… Actually… hmm… If we got a hotel room, we could bring the birds too.  (Turns to audience) Hey! Is there anyone out there who we could hire to spend about 4-6 hours with our birds and otherwise watch TV on Sat and Sun? Phoenix and I want to go camping, and we really cant bring the birds with us.  (Goes back to story)  Well, back to the park, I felt kind of silly trying to fish in a river with rods set up for surf casting, and had no lures to do any surface work. But seeing a bald eagle overhead was worth the stop. I also got my first catch of shrimp ever. First one Phoenix picked up pricked her finger with its horn, but they were fun to catch none the less. I wish they were eating size!  Next we went to the beach again, went out to the sand bar, and just as the fish started to bite, the storm came and we had to go home. Both Phoenix and I had a great time.  The next day, we went to Martin’s for 4th of July grilling, and it smashing as usual. Phoenix got some time to talk with Martin, and the fireworks display in combination with a cloud to cloud lightning storm (not to mention the spectacular rainbow at sunset) really made the day. Thank you Elizabeth for the garb!

       urlLink    Just when we were settling in, and the fish had stolen one or two baits, the daily storm started to roll in. This came from the north and was amazing looking. I thought at first it was just going out to sea and would miss us, but it went right over us!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    We got to the beach at close to low tide, but it was coming back quick! Every 20 minutes or so, we had to move everything another 15 feet back. We swam out to the sandbank (with my pole in hand) and it went from about 6 foot deep to about knee high on the bar, and that's were we started casting.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here is a better picture of Phoenix on the dock. The other cool thing that happened here is we got to see a bald eagle fly overhead and an osprey carry off a fish. Did I mention that after I fooled around with the cast net and came up with about nothing, she tried it her first time and caught about 8 minnows? I thought I was supposed to be the expert (hah!)&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    We went fishing this last Sat... After the disaster of fishing on the Pylon next to the lighthouse (our lines got snagged everytime we cast, and ran out of rigs) we stopped by a cute little park that sat on the river nearby. However the fish just mocked up by jumping out of the water all around us and not biting (we really didnt have the right rigs for that kind of fishing). We did get out the cast net and cought minnows and small shrimp... In time we headed for the beach...&nbsp; urlLink

      Another day and it’s another 8 hours of staring at a computer screen. It’s a wonder I’m not blind yet, or have brain cancer.  This weekend’s plans are mad crazy, Fishing at New Smyrna Beach, seeing a movie (hmm, F 9/11? King Arthur? Spiderman2?), going to Martins for grill out, then fireworks at Lake Eola. Somewhere in there we got to clean the parrot cages, and keep them somewhat entertained. I just hope I can catch a fish or two. I saw a wonderful, well written negative review on Spiderman 2 from a friend (although they liked the movie as a whole)  “Actress problems: The puke-orange hair looked hideously tawdry - like a trailer-trash hooker who's been dumpster diving for cosmetics. Her half-closed, sloe eyes reveal no sign of intellect, and seem as though it's a struggle to remember to breathe, much less say her lines. Her breasts hang down below her waistband like sunken dugs - the wonders that a simple brassiere would do for this flappy-chested trollop. I've seen better shapes on Ugandan refugees with 12 children. During the 'kiss me' scene, when her wasted, thin little lips kept advancing toward the camera, I got the same nasty feeling in my stomach that I did during the scene in Private Ryan when the soldier went back for his severed arm.”   Whew! Can’t wait to see it! *grin*  For this weekend’s fishing, I would like to try a new tack. Instead of wading out to waist deep water and using frozen shrimp, I want to get on the pylon next to the inlet there (at New Smyrna Beach) and use live shrimp on one pole (the one Phoenix will run, I expect it will catch a lot more) and large minnows for one of the other poles to try to get the big fish… I might bring my cast net to see if I can get more bait. I liked fishing last time, but I think this time I want to do some catching, and not just have fun getting wet.

       urlLink MY WAR - Fear And Loathing In Iraq: AL QAEDA   More follow up on that attack from yesterday.  What confuses me is why this has gotten almost no coverage in the news?  One of my co-workers is convinced that its becuase the media thinks this wouldn't make Bush look bad, so they have ignored it.  But if you follow that logic, this would be a great story to put on spin. The media could take the tack that our troops are fighting the good fight, and that Bush's incompetancy let Al-Qaeda attack them.  I dont know... Just Crazy...

      Woke up this morning at 2am to see the messenger launch, and I think it was well worth it. The alarm went off and I bounced out of bed, much to Phoenix’s chagrin, who did not react with as much excitement from being forced out of her slumber in the middle of the night. I looked outside and saw the moon, so it was clear, and went to the launch website just to make sure nothing else had happened to cancel the launch. Much to my relief, it was on! I dragged poor Phoenix outside to the street, and was somewhat bummed because there was some cloud cover. After a couple of minutes, when I was sure that it should have gone off, I thought that there were too many clouds in the way. To my surprise, right when I was turning to go, there it was, like a bright flare going off in the distance burning though the slight haze that was in the sky. Phoenix and I watched as it got smaller and smaller and finally died away. Then went back to bed.              I love launches. Even from 40 miles away they inspire me.

      Not much time to write today, so I will be quick…  Friday Phoenix and I watched the Manchurian Candidate and it was a good movie… made me feel really creeped out at the end. Sea World was a lot of fun on Saturday. Watched Shamu (or whatever the whale is really called) go through the typical show stuff, which I have to say is very entertaining if you are in the splash zone (which we were) The dolphin show was the same way. Much more interesting being in the splash zone. Finally got to go on the Atlantis ride, and got wet on that one too. The funny part was the fact I forgot to mention to Phoenix that the big plunge into the water was not the end of the ride. She smacked me after we rocketed around the end part of the ride. To tell the truth, I forgot that there was more. By that time we were too tired to do much anything else and went home and zonked. Sunday, well we cleaned the bird cages and had a pleasant day just laying around the house and talking and getting some good alone time in with my favorite bird.  Woke up at 2am this morning to see if the launch (messenger)  was going to happen, looked out the window and saw clouds and said screw it (and it was canceled). Maybe it will launch tonight, but I doubt it. It’s supposed to rain all day because of T.S. Alex drawing moisture from the gulf, so I suspect it will not be clear to either see from Orlando, or it might not go because of weather.  *sigh* pictures later
