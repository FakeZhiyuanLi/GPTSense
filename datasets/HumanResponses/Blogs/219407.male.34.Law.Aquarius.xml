						   Saddam Hussein, bearing an  urlLink uncanny resemblance to the star of Monk ,  urlLink appeared in an Iraqi courtroom  for his arraignment.  According to published reports, he was  urlLink defiant and confrontational .   A defiant Saddam Hussein rejected charges of war crimes and genocide against him in a court appearance Thursday, telling a judge "this is all theater, the real criminal is Bush."   The major media played the story with all the usual bluster one usually expects, with most outlets keeping the headlines focused on the "theater/Bush" quote.   urlLink Hussein Brands Court Hearing 'Theater'    urlLink Saddam in court: 'The real criminal is Bush'   Of course Fox, being fair and balanced, focused on Saddam's demeanor:  urlLink Defiant Saddam Refuses to Sign Charges.   (As if refusing to sign the charges is a problem- "Hey Mr. Accused Serial Killer, would you sign this?  No?  Dammit, now we can't touch him!")  Tony Shalhoub had no comment.

      After not having a blog for almost a year- substantially the fault of my inability to do PHP code- I decided it was time to return to the original source:  urlLink Blogger .  You can always count on offsite, third party software to work when you want it to work.  Usually.  So, a little about me.  I'm a lawyer- specifically a criminal defense lawyer in a larger Pennsylvania county.  Meaning that I can't tell you which one.  But it's larger, a'ight?  And slightly Amishy.  Anyway, crime happens out here in the sticks, just like in the big city.  That's where I come in.  Not really, but when I write my book about the experience, that'll be where I come in.  I'm married- to a  urlLink very lovely woman , who knew of  urlLink all   urlLink my   urlLink vices  before we got married.  She, of course, has no vices and walks on air.  That's the way of the world- all men marry someone better than they deserve.  Oh well, now that this is back up I expect to rejoin the world of the cyberopinionated.

      Last night I went to a football match.&nbsp; Not  urlLink football ,  urlLink football .&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Manchester United  and  urlLink Celtic  played a friendly (read, exhibition) match in Philly.&nbsp; Celtic defeated Man U. 2-1, on the strength of a penalty kick and goalkeeper badly drawn out of position.  Ordinarily, my understanding of sport is intuitive.&nbsp; I was never very good at any sports, mind you, but I always  understood  the games, sometimes at a level that even the athletes themselves never got.&nbsp; Soccer not so much.&nbsp; The clock counts up, for one thing&nbsp;(and bears no relation to the actual length of the match, thanks to the subjective and goofy concept of "extra time").&nbsp; Some fouls get you direct free kicks, some indirect (in which it appears the&nbsp;tactic most often employed is to kick the ball off your opponent's nuts).&nbsp; It does not appear as though any strategy exists, unless you consider "run around until something happens" a strategy.  The point is that I don't get the game the way I get other games.&nbsp; I was reduced to making inane comments.&nbsp; For example-   Hey,  urlLink that guy  has Christina Aguilera's haircut.&nbsp; The second one.&nbsp; No, not the second guy, the second haircut.    I like that they're all wearing high socks.&nbsp; Kind of an homage to the Negro Leagues.    So when do we start the hooliganism?&nbsp; I have to say, hooliganism is one of my favorite words.    &nbsp;  Offsides occurs when the ball is passed downfield, and the recipient of the pass is further downfield than any defender, at the time the pass is made.&nbsp; If the recipient is upfield when the pass is made, but runs past the defenders while the ball is aflight, that is not offsides.&nbsp; Unless, of course, he is on the other side of the blue line.&nbsp; Wait, what?   I'd like to see some English football fan attempt to explain the infield fly rule, or maybe the corner blitz.  Soccer will never take off in America for one simple reason- there are awfully long stretches of running around doing nothing.&nbsp; Even more so than in baseball, where low scoring can be spun into good fielding.&nbsp; Nope, in soccer, you basically watch skinny guys run around until something happens.  I guess.

      Saturday I went golfing with Jeff.&nbsp; The bartender made my pre-round bloody marys strong.&nbsp; Very strong.&nbsp; As a result, I sucked extra hard.&nbsp; Then I drank many margaritas that night and passed out by 8:30.&nbsp; Heluva partier I am.  Still trying not to fuck up, and it seems to be working (although an imprudent comment to one ADA about another ADA may have its way back to the, by now no doubt, offended party.&nbsp; She left a somewhat cryptic message on my voice mail.&nbsp; If it did make it back to her, then I guess what I have really learned is that I should not trust the ADA to whom I was speaking.&nbsp; No biggie.&nbsp; It's generally a good idea to keep the subject of the conversation at a distance.&nbsp; She can be dramatic and unreasonable.  I'm swinging back to a state of hating the place in which I live.&nbsp; Malvern is a nothing to do exurb of a nothing to do city.&nbsp; I've always rather despised the suburbs, so the  urlLink exurbs  are even more despicable.&nbsp; On the whole I would rather live in a city, but my beloved will not hear of it- something about school distrcits and quality of life.&nbsp; The school district thing is, generally, a fallacy invented by realtors to drive up their commissions.&nbsp; Since 99% of all public schools basically do little more than inculcate the values of conformity and conspicuous consumption, I see little benefit to any one school district over another.&nbsp; As for quality of life- I sit in my basement watching TV most nights.&nbsp; Some quality.  Of course, Philly ain't no prized place to live.&nbsp; Far and away, it is the crappiest city I've ever been in.&nbsp; No theatre to speak of, no music scene (save what the  urlLink monopolistic&nbsp;promoter  gives us), no arthouse cinema.&nbsp; If it weren't the  urlLink best college basketball town in America , Philly would be utterly irredeemable.&nbsp; If I could, I'd live somewhere else.&nbsp; But I can't, so I don't.&nbsp; I just completely friggin' despise Philaldelphia and the shitholes that surround it.  Lastly, this personality test was very accurate!&nbsp; I recommend it highly.           Big Five Test Results

      Her lips are moving.  I am so infuriated at a client right now.&nbsp; I worked very hard and&nbsp;pulled strings to get her into a rehab, even though she fled from her last trip to treatment.&nbsp; I got a call from probation this morning.&nbsp; She escaped from the van transporting her to rehab.  I can only do so much for these people, and I know that most of them want to screw up their own lives.&nbsp; I just don't get the drugs.&nbsp; I really don't.

       Don't fuck up.  &nbsp; After taking a long hard look at the state of life, I realized that all my mistakes were my own doing.&nbsp; I set a simple managable goal- don't fuck up.&nbsp; I broke it down into five, even more managable components- don't fuck up Monday, don't fuck up Tuesday, etc etc etc.&nbsp; As of lunch today, I am in full compliance (although&nbsp;BLW noted that I am self-grading- true dat). &nbsp; Which is not to say that nothing got fucked up.&nbsp; Wednesday morning, my cohort in the juvie rotation was supposed to be at detention hearings.&nbsp; He was not.&nbsp; Instead, he was scheduled to present a bail petition- on behalf of my client.&nbsp; Not his client, mine.&nbsp; Not that unusual, we switch around busy work all the time.&nbsp; However, I didn't ask him to present a petition that I prepared.&nbsp; He drafted the petition, he filed the petition, and he was going to present the petition, without me knowing about it. &nbsp; I walk in Wednesday morning to a shitstorm of pissed off people who think that I dropped the ball.&nbsp; Badly.&nbsp; DAC, the most senior attorney present, thinks that I screwed up.&nbsp; I show him my schedule- "But it's&nbsp;the fuckup's&nbsp;day," I say. &nbsp; "Well, he was going to do your bail petition," says DAC. &nbsp; I look at him blankly.&nbsp;  "What bail petition?"  &nbsp; I had the fuckup in question cover a plea for me last week.&nbsp; The client no showed, bench warrant issued.&nbsp;  Then  he looked at the post-it note I attached to the file-  "Client wants to pull plea and go to trial." &nbsp; He's been unfairly warranted, he thinks.&nbsp; I can fix this, he thinks.&nbsp; He goes off and files the petition without my knowledge and doublebooks himself. &nbsp; It all got straightened out.&nbsp; I didn't fuck up, but it was touch and go for a bit.

      I'm a fuck up.  Meaning,  inter alia , that I fuck things up.  Things, meaning home, work, relationships, anything really.  It's no secret, I like to go to strip clubs.  Hunnybunny doesn't quite get why.  She thinks it's about the mostly undressed 19 year-old sitting on my lap.  That's a good part of it.  Mostly, though, it's a temporary connection that I can't fuck up.  They will say and do whatever it takes to seperate you from your money.  Mostly, that entails finding you  very  interesting- no matter what.  Whatever you say, they want you to know that it's fascinating.  "Well, I enjoy killing cats." "Really?  So do I!  Lapdance?"  So, let's say for a second that I really did enjoy killing cats- I don't, mind you.  I am the loving owner of three cats.  Okay, so I love two of them- the third needs a lobotomy.  Anyway, assume that I do.  Is that the sort of thing one should talk about?  Generally, no.  Not at home, certainly not at work, absolutely never to the SPCA.  Tell the stripper, because she of course will find it fascinating, and do everything in your power to make you feel normal about it.  Tell no one else.  Ever.  So what do I do?  Tell the cat lovers at work.  Rub it in their faces.  Make them know that not only am I a catkiller, I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Of course, I'm not a catkiller.  I'm a sex nut.  At least I talk like a sex nut.  Basically, I just want to make love with Hunnybunny.  But if I talk about midget porn, talk about the best breed for dogfucking, talk about how hot a certain juvenile probation officer looks the more pregnant she gets, I will get noticed.  Then fail to do the  job  itself.  Let a date pass because you didn't write it down.  Let stacks of papers accumulate on your desk until the piles become pile, singular, big.  Never write your clients back.  Schedule a guilty plea for a client you've never spoken to.  I had a moment of clarity the other day.  I am a fuck up, that's true.  Not because I can't do the job, not because I won't do the job.  Because fucking up is a way to get noticed.  I have a need to be in trouble because somehow I got it in my head that it's a good way to get attention.  Not good attention- but any attention is good.  I know on an intellectual level that it's not a good way to live.  On an emotional level, it's really the only way I know how to be.  My best traits- sense of humor, spontaneous, outside the box thinking- are very close cousins to my worst traits- bizarre off-putting commentary, an inability to think before I speak, unable to work within rules and guidelines.  I've got to get my dark side under control, so that the best of me comes through.  The hard part is that my best and my worst occupy the same space.  This is the first step in getting out of the grave I've dug for myself.  Gonna take some work, but I'm ready to do it.  Gotta go to court- see ya later.

      Hope everyone had a great holiday!  Hunnybunny and I had a weekend of fun-filled goodness.  Friday night, we went to Chi-Chi's- it was karaoke night- and had some horrendous Mexican food, a great margarita, and listened to excruciatingly awful singing.  Then we saw Spider-Man 2, and ran in  urlLink Deb  and Ned!  Saturday, we went to New Hope, had dinner, walked around, came home and got frisky!  Yes, actual, honest-to-God frisky!!!  Much fun!  Incidentally, we didn't use... cover.  I guess that means we're now trying to have kids- and I'm cool with that.  Sunday, I was in a fantastic mood, prompting Hunnybunny to note that I am a happier person after having sex.  To which I say, no duh.  We had breakfast at Classic Diner, went to Costco (oooooh), and then went to Wilmington to see the  urlLink Blue Rocks  and fireworks.  I had never been to a Blue Rocks game before- I must say that they put on a good show.  The Rocks had a contest some time ago to come up with the stupidest mascot- the winner was  urlLink Mr. Celery .  Yes- he's a piece of celery.  He runs out onto the field after each Rocks tun.  Hunnybunny wouldn't let me get the Mr. Celery hat.  For shame!  Yesterday, we had errands to run, and a house to clean (okay, Hunnybunny did most... all of the housecleaning).  My in-laws came over for dinner- we had some really good steak an excellent warm spinach salad.  I like them- they're fun to talk to.  That's all for now!  Stay tuned!

      Played softball last night, and the folks at Adult Probation kicked our sorry asses.  I hurt.  Bad.  They had me catch, so my squatting muscles are sore, sore, sore.  My batting line doesn't sound that bad in the abstract: 2-4, 3 RBI, 1 BB.  Then remember that this was SLOW PITCH.  Makes ya wonder why I care.  Oh wait- I don't.

      These are interesting times, which is a Chinese curse.  Shouting passes for debate, PR passes for journalism, and spin passes for commentary.  Informed opinion has virtually disappeared- in fact, many very smart people are paid an awful lot of money to undermine informed opinion.  When politics and policy are at an impasse, policy stands firm- the rhetoric changes.  Case in point: when it becvame apparent that there were no weapons of mass destruction to be found in Iraq, the administration changed the language to the more evasive "evidence of weapons programs."  Another example (from the other side in the interest of fairness): about ten years ago during the Republican attempt to create term limits for Congress, a Democrat from Michigan (I believe) introduced a strict term limits bill (two terms- no exceptions, no grandfathering)- he knew that a bill that strong would never pass, but would draw support off other less extreme that could pass.  Bottom line, term limits were defeated, he got to vote for his own bill, and then in his next reelction campaign, proudly advertised that he introduced "the toughest terms limits bill in Congress."  Now I ask you people-  was he really for term limits?   Of course not- everything he said was technically true, of course, but contextually a big fat lie.  In these times, policy and politics are at such a disconnect that leaders are more or less actively trying to do one thing and pass it off as another.   Is Iraq free now that the country is in the control of (hand picked, pro-America, oil slave) Iraqis?  Will the new government do anything more than rubber stamp the policies already in place?  Of course not- but now the White House has some cover.  When politics and policy are at a disconnect, the policy remains the same- just find some new way to sell it.  Lee Greenwood once sang, "I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free."  And I am proud to be an American, but right now we are not free.  We are under the control of an  urlLink idiotic despot , who believes that all who question him are traitors.  We are not traitors, Mr. President.  It is you who have undermined the principles of this great nation.  Don't worry- I'm sure that your  urlLink friends  will find you good work.

      I have actual work to do.  Motions to draft, letters to write, phone calls to make.  Instead, I am sitting in my office with the door closed, more or less knowingly not doing it.  It wouldn't be such a big deal, except that not doing my work has been a bit of my MO of late.  I have pencilled in the afternoon to get shit done.  I also pencilled in yesterday afternoon to get shit done.  And the day before that.  See where this is all headed.  Fortunately, this is trial term.  All busy work (probation violations, guilty pleas, preliminary hearings, etc) ceases, and the Court does jury trials.  I have nothing on the trial list, so this is a golden opportunity to get caught up on my backlog of shiznit.  So what do I do?  I begin a  urlLink new project - one that I have wanted to do for awhile now- but not at all what I ought to be doing.  I never have had a knack for doing what I ought to, though.  In fact, I have a keen sense for doing exactly the wrong thing at precisely the wrong moment.  It's my own sixth sense.
