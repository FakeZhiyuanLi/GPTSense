      I just finished reading this book of short stories written by some of the famous Filipino authors in the league of NVM Gonzales, Manuel Quezon III, and several others. The book is entitled Chimera. It featured stories about societal trash that remain taboo for mealtime conversations. The stories are actually a common fare for a kid like me who grew up in the hustling life of a big city. Fast cars, deafening noise, police car sirens, traffic, smog. All these things that contribute to a miserable daily living that can be likened to a dirty wall repainted again and again by temporary chemicals to cover up a façade. But there is more to the dark avenues and the garbage-filled creeks. There are whispered voices that change the dampness of the city corners with bliss. It was perhaps these voices that awaken the sleeping ignorance of the people why these stories were written. And it was beautiful. These are stories worth telling for bedtime.   Story #1  A nameless man who lives a life detached from the usual tricks of conformity shares a wonderful childhood with a friend whom he is secretly attracted to. Time, as usual, got a bit cruel to their friendship. The woman fell in love with another man who happens to dislike the best friend. The woman had to move to a farther town to pursue college and that meant another detachment from him. They communicated through letters, all of which contained the world of a miserable man who is unable to find sunlight after that uneventful leaving of the woman.   (this blog to be continued)...

      Paulo Coelho (Alchemist) says that "If you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it."  Excuse me Pao dude, but I beg to disagree. No, not beg. I insist.  It's been a boring long day. All this waiting for something I don't even know. This has always been my problem everytime I'm not at work. I always answer to the same question again and again: how will I shorten the time of not doing something? I have a compulsion that's hard to deal with. I cannot just sit there, smell the misty breeze of rainy June and  follow the sun.  I just can't do that. I am often advised by my friends to try to relax and take things easy.   Anyway. That line from Coelho just struck me when I realized how much wanting have been unanswered. I don't sulk as much though because I think it's a total waste of time. And now that I'm in the middle of having a grand time writing down my thoughts, I just got a message that I'll be picked up and head home. Fuck it.

      This movie is really good. I now have a sudden craving for violence, and blood and revenge. It's probably because I also want revenge. I want to murder someone who deserves to be dead.

      Beyonce Knowles is one hot babe. Man, I can be a lesbian for her! Hahaha.... I don't know what's up with me but everytime I go online, I'd log on to yahoo! Launch and watch her video called "naughty girl" and also Britney Spears' "toxic"... gee whiz! Am i turning  jologs?  Hahaha.. Anyways, I had a my usual DVD marathon viewing last night and I dunno if any of you guys heard about this play called BENT (which was remade into a movie). It's a story about a homosexual in the time of Hitler and he tried covering up his true sexuality for fear of worse treatment, so he told no one about his real identity (except being Jewish)...until he fell in love with another Jewish prisoner in the camp. The story kinda blew me away. It's one of those movies that gave me a hard time breathing and I can't sleep afterwards just thinking about the message I got from the film. I know it's just a movie, but it made me depressed all the same. Sigh... You guys should see it. It's beautiful.

      I went to the university to get my appraisal for the remaining courses that I still need to enroll in for the nest semester. I guess it wasn't really the brightest thing to do. I was informed that I need to enroll in three subjects (as opposed to the regular two-subject enrolment). That means I have to make extra effort in managing my time from work and school this coming months. Geez, I can already see myself wanting to kill me. Oh well.

      I have ADHD. I cannot last 5 minutes watching TV without changing channels. I love eating balut (duck embryo). Texting preoccupies 90% of my time, and eats up 70% of my income. The remaining 30% goes to cab fares. I can read just about anything as long as it makes sense to me. I'm a fastfood baby, fine dining irks me...though it's good if someone asks me out and appears to be interested in paying a huge meal bill. I watch Star Circle Quest (the local version of American Idol)...and I cannot imagine one of them will soon be a star. I am for Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, because even if righteous jerks think that she is a traditional politician, I still believe that she can run our country and to all you FPJ fanatics--fuck off.I wish I can have a tarsier for a pet. I'm facing civil charges on conspiracy right now (ain't that chic? It's so mafia! I love it!). I am battling with people who are so intelligent they can pretend to be the dumbest bunch of asses to walk the earth. Oh well, who says life is a beautiful piece of a violin song? Fuck it.

      The blow in my head hurt like a bullet from Bill's .45 caliber classic. Yeah, think of me as Uma Thurman in my most unglamorous cinematic shot: blood spilling out of my nose like some thick gravy for your McChicken, and wounds distributed unevenly all over my visage it cannot even pass for a constellation. Anyway. The blow was caused by a sudden shift of perceptions about my unmeaningful misery. A misery that shouldn't be taken as a medical or psychological case but rather a simple incident of stupidity. Well who says we don't make stupid moves? We all do. But let me just speak for myself. Thanks for the hanky, Uma.  So the road to recovery is just in sight. I told ya I'm fast. Yesterday I looked like shit who didn't know what a condom is for. I was totally lost I cannot remember some parts of the day. But today I woke up alright. I felt the warmth of the sun envelop my skin and the radiation that goes with it which will eventually kill humanity. I heal my own wounds fast. I can easily pick up the broken pieces and put them together not using Elmer's but my own booger. I can play the music again and hum to the tune of Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive." Hahaha. Talk about being a queen. You might ask how I did it. It's easy (Uma says "Yeah right"):  1. Drink lots of water. It is medically and theoritically true that water cleanses our body and soul. It's a symbolic ritual that ends with you standing up pissing it out. Ain't it chic?  2. Eat sausages, hotdogs, longganisa, etc. Their peculiar appearance will definitely disturb you no matter how stoic you're supposed to be. The disturbance will help you get distracted with whatever it is that freezes you.  3. Watch Joey Gosiengfiao's "Temptation Island." You will realize that his brilliance lies not in the absurdity of his work, but in the absurdity of his audiences. You should have seen how I laughed with snots bubbling out of my nose.  4. Don't buy load. (For line subscribers, since you're richer, throw your phones) This will prevent you from doing anything even stupider.  5. Bring friends to your house and have dinner. Don't let them notice you're miserable. Act as if you're perfectly all right. That way, they can monkey around and even start talking about something kinky.   These are the major ones. It's fun and free, so take advantage of it. Forget about the "defense mechanisms" part of the discussion. It's a major wham. It can make things complicated. It can rock your lovely boat. Let's just say, you're in total shape and you don't mind any other things. I know our subconscious will go hunt us down, but . . . yeah. . .   ...what if my subconscious really hunts me down? Geez....It will probably be another bullet that will knock me dead.

      THE BEAUTIFUL ONE   Brewing With Confusion  I have never felt so strange about myself until today. For the first time in my life, I cannot define whether I was happy or I was being miserable. I know my friends would tell me in their usual way of advice that I’m just going through another phase again. But really, I have never felt this much confusion. It took me 24 hours to get all mixed up and question a lot of things about my understanding of what I really want in my life.   I didn’t have enough sleep for two nights now. I know that this actually aggravates my state, but then, I cannot force myself to sleep as easy as switching off a light bulb. I have been battling with my own evil. I seem to want “things” that I know can destroy me and I want it to stop. My desires are quiet. It boils deep down inside me waiting to explode. I long to be with someone who doesn’t even know my longing and I am worried because I don’t know if it’s doing any good for both of us. This is probably a usual case of ‘sleeping attractions’ suspended by distance and only awakens when the right circumstance of contact occurs. And it’s true. What makes this worse is that I’m supposed to know exactly what to do. But I don’t. I’m seeing visions of hopes of embracing reality that is about to break down. But the surreal longing is now becoming stronger that it’s overshadowing my own concept of reality. It scares me.    The Beautiful One  Dipping in the evening waters with the crescent moon teasing down on us was a perfectly blissful moment. It felt like the whole world was made of water. And it was beautiful. For a while, time didn’t exist. It was just me and the beautiful one. Our ballet in waters had stirred the sleeping planktons that apparently surrounded us like fireflies breathing with scents of tulips. Even with my eyes closed, the tenderness that held me close to the beautiful one seeped through my eyelids and created a symphony of colors so much better than the rainbow. Everything fell into place with more wanting, more yearning and more intensity. My academic mind was put to a full stop. It was my heart feasting on the moment and it was bad.    The Future  I don’t know. What I know is that I’m still thinking about those moments. I’m still fighting and I don’t know when this fighting will be over and which will triumph. I just wish I can find the answers soon.
