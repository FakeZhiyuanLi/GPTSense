      The war on terror and the war in Iraq has been an essential part of America's history and evolution. The fact that another being or entity could and would attack another country and violate it's rights of freedom and prosperity shows a complete lack of control in the world. This is completely unacceptable. As our president, George W. Bush, has done his best to keep the past few years balanced and in a state of peace. With that in mind, the whole effort and plan to civilize and reconstruct Iraq with democracy in it's place of the old regime of tyranny and violence to a society with self-control shows that this president knows what he is doing. Although most people would argue that would be an inaccurate assessment of the reconstruction of Iraq and our president's job due to the rebels and loyalists that still exist today. But, what plan is not with mistakes; for, every president in the path to justice and civil disobedience has found that along their way in defending our country there has been, in the period after war, a great deal of struggles. And, as long as there is a plan to follow, only peace can be the final conclusion of reconstruction. That, no matter what type of president you are, as long as you are able to defend your country and bring about peace, however bad that prosperity may seem, you are a good leader. For, even the greatest presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt had trouble during war times. Roosevelt had to create several plans in a group of projects and programs called the New Deal to help him in the reconstruction of American during the great depression and war that was coming. So whether or not Bush was able to come up with a fancy plan, he was able to defend his country, which, all presidents of America have conquered. Making Bush a president among heroes.  Furthermore, the battle with the attacks that took place on 9-11 even furthers the greatness of our president. He stood up to the terrorist and clearly took action. Bush made sure that someone would pay for this wrongful and unjust attack. And, due to the fact that he did take action, many American's and enemies were shocked. Making the world a place that would ensure change. Just, look at the way America is changing today, the precautions that are taken. America and the world as we know it has changed. The way we live today is much different than the one we knew ten years ago. That, "This comprehensive [Homeland Security] plan lays out clear lines of authority and clear responsibilities _ responsibilities for federal employees and for governors and mayors and community and business leaders and the American citizens," (http://server.firehouse.com/frontlines/news/02/0716.html) Bush said; where we would be able to take responsibility and ensure safety for our nation. Making the United States a better nation and country. Proving this plan something that would help defend us from future terrorist attacks. Therefore, creating a better government and nation; making Bush's efforts to rebuild Iraq further defend our country a success. Further spreading prosperity.   However, if a new presidential candidate were to come into the picture and change the plans of Bush and future America, only one outcome could take place. Either great success or great failure. But, based upon the past and other presidential role models the more likely outcome is failure. So, in order to maintain this so called prosperity I speak of, vote for Bush and keep things on one path - the success of America. Andrew Perez
