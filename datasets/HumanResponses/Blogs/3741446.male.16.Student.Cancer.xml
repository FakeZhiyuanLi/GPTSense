      refer to this  urlLink thread at g4techtv.   THe japanese officially rule hardcore now. First they breed Shigeru Miyomato and Hideo Kojima and the ninja's and samurai now it's murderous icons.   In the words of Asmoron I     What the fuck is wrong with the japanese man. THe girl murdered this person and she gets her own anime and manga. So it goes to show that if you brutally massacre a person you get your own action toy in  mcdonald's happy meal. keep that in mind when the next time you decide to kill someone.   I'm looking at you trig.

      Just another joke to take up space because we  never get anything else new on this page.     Ancient Chinese Torture    A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. "I'm lost," said the man. "Can you put me up for the night?"  "Certainly," the Chinese man said, "but on one condition. If you so much as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man."   "Ok," said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.   Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful, and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.   He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, "Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest." "Well, that's pretty crappy," he thought. "If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about." He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: "Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle." In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, "Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost."

      I think it's time I can start a chain of joke threads like this every week. One week that joke, this week this joke. hope ya get it   10 Things In Golf That Sound Dirty    1. Look at the size of his putter.  2. Oh, dang, my shaft's all bent.  3. You really wacked the hell out of that sucker.  4. After 18 holes I can barely walk.  5. My hands are so sweaty I can't get a good grip.  6. Lift your head and spread your legs.  7. You have a nice stroke, but your follow through leaves a lot to be desired.  8. Just turn your back and drop it.  9. Hold up. I've got to wash my balls.  10. Damn, I missed the hole again.

      What the hell is up with this n-gage qd thing?First of all,what the fuck kinda name is that?Secondly,why make another craptastic hanheld thing.  For the lucky who have never heard of n-gage,it's suppost to be some handheld system thing that doubles as a cell phone.That's pretty gay considering the damn thing costs $250.I have a much better idea.Go to walmart and buy a cellphone.Then go to a video games store and buy a gameboy advance sp. The n-gage had a great take off.Then that great take off went straight to hell and now it sucks ass.Graphics suck ass.Sound sucks ass.N-gage sucks ass.  What the fuck is up with the gaytastic advertizment for this thing?Ok I will guide you through if you have never seen it before(only the lucky few).A ninja is in a laundromat cleaning his cloths.His machine gets stuch.He punches it.STOP!If I was a ninja,I wouldn't punch it,I would whip out my badass dragon sword and slice the thing into cubes. Anyway,on with the commercial.Some chick comes over and unjams the machine he is using.He then says "unstuck".He is about to put his pussy ninja panties in there when he spys another ninja.A PINK ninja.A PINK DUDE ninja.He drops his panties and draws his sword.So does the PINK DUDE ninja.Then there's some shit about the n-gage QD.End commercial.Overall,a pretty gay ass commercial for a pretty gay ass piece of hardware.

      Here's a rant about something in the mall today.   Ok I'm just strolling along the stores to find something to waste my 175 dollars of b-day money, and then i see Hot topic. As most of you know (especially Tomcat here who's already had one rant about it) the place has gone to hell. Literally. The fucking entrance was a goddamned cave-looking entrance. 1600s anyone? No? you suck then....Well anywho, I just stand there in front of the entrance, gaping at the shear stupidity of what what it was, Evanescence-wannabes strolling by with chains that could make their boobs sag like an old lady's ass. Not that'd I'd know of course.......stop laughing.   Well one of the store managers sees me and tells me to move along because i was blocking the customers. there was like five feet left of space in the opening, just enough for some lady with a sign on her back saying "I was Godzilla's ass in the movie" and the nearest gothic chick was like 50 feet away. I'm like "What customers? Your store sucks! I mean, i wear black jackets and pants, but come on! Have you actually shoved that many punk cds up your ass that it reaches your brain?!" Ok maybe so it was more of a remix version of that. She still got the point and sicked security on me. what security you ask? Gay dudes with ugly sticks that's what. they chased me about halfway across the wall until I lost them in JCpenny's. The only regret i had then was not taking some perfume and spraying their eyes. At least i could outrun two gay dudes who probably screw every fucking night. probably just getting old. Oh well. I'm pretty fast anyway. Outran the entire soccer team once. But screw that. I need to think a little more about that. Chow

      I'm currently working on a much more extensive rant, the details of which I won't discuss further until I post it, but since we are currently experiencing an insufficient supply of rants, I thought I'd post one before I go to bed.  I can't stand it when people who are not educated on a given subject profess their extreme viewpoints as if they had actually taken the time to develop the ridiculous opinions they feel the need to express. They ramble on without regard for attempts by those with actual knowledge of the subject to point out the flaws in their erroneous beliefs, and refuse to acknowledge any reasonable argument against themselves. I'm sorry but "STFU" and "NUH UH" are not adequate responses when confronted with major design flaws in one's theory.  If I am ever out of my depth in a certain topic or discussion, which does not happen often, I prefer to listen to those who are more well informed than myself and ask question to better my own understanding. I choose not to accost those I should be learning from with incoherent babble, but to conduct myself in a scientific demeanor, so that I might eloquently express myself to some tragically unversed fool in the future.  In closing, Please, you mighty offenders of civilized discourse, stop pretending like you know everything. You are annoying those of us that do.

      Who the fuck ever thought this up?! Some desperate 19 year old uber-nerd who couldn't get laid if the world was on the line?! It was Bill gates wasn't it?! That sick fuck has always been conspiring crap! Look what he did to his house! he turned it into the first fully computerized home in the world! He doesn't even have to make his own food! It fucking cooks its own ass! Damn you Mr. gates! DAMN YOU I SAY!!  Back to the sick asshats who cyber-screw. YOU. ARE. SHIT. HEADS. Can't even get laid and they're over 18.......sick bastards. You should all burn in hell. I mean seriously! You all fuckin just write your screwing by roleplaying! I can  ALMOST  understand it when 13 year olds do it, since they can't get screwed even if they were the jessica Simpson of jr. high, but that just makes them REALLY fuckin perverted. Horny fucks......shame on you. Shame on you all! Losing your virginity to your fuckin comp...not right. basically, BURN IN HELL YOU SICK FUCKS. And if anyone who is reading this does cyber, shut up and take it up the tailpipe! Take your whiney ass remarks, and shove em up your ass. Then again, you'll probably use that in your next cyber-screw anyway.   Moral: Don't stick your dick in the fuckin :D drive or whatever, you sick bastard

      I usually try to avoid out and out ranting, but I'm really mad, so you'll forgive me if I lack my usual eloquence.  Lowe's is the enemy. I enter the usually pretty crappily run hardware store expecting it to be the sanctuary of it has been in the past. This was usually a place I could avoid the bullshit the rest of the world feeds us on a daily basis, even if it was poorly managed, difficult to navigate, and usually misrepresenting its products one way or another.  Today however, something was different. Upon entering the store, I notice the usual displays set up in the main isle. A few how to books, a couple of specials, not thing much out of the ordinary. Just then, I see something so horrible, so disgusting and vile, I shutter to mention it. "DECORATING WITH LIZZIE MCGUIRE!" Infact, it was an entire series of home improvent and craft books from Lizzie right in the middle of my beloved saws and drills. WTF KINDA 9 YEAR OLD GIRL IS GOING TO REMODEL HER OWN ROOM! Licensing has gone too far, and Disney, once a respectable company from my youth, has become PURE EVIL!  Tell me now, WHO COULD POSSIBLY THINK THAT ANYTHING LIZZIE MCGUIRE BELONGS IN THE MIDDLE OF MY TOOL WORLD? In the future, you stupid store managing assholes do your jobs and keep that shit in the KID'S DECORATAING SECTION if you must allow into my store at all.   LOWE'S SUCKS ASS!

      At g4ttv there are these asshats who think that if you join at a certain time i.e.; 2002, it makes you cool some how. What the fuck is up with that? Just because you joined seven months before a person it some how makes you more superior than them? You know what fuck them and fuck people who think like them.   I remeber at techtv no n00b got made fun ragged on unless they totally deserved it. That's why I liked techtv everyone practially knew everyone and really respected eachother post count or no post count.   I admit I do that myself sometimes but most of the time I'm joking. So the next time you rag on someone because they joined later than you do us all a favor and kill yourself.....yes I meant that literally.

      Ladies and gentleman of the blogging community, popular music is in dire need of you help. Even as record sales continue to rise, artistic expression and even involvement decrease with every Britney and N Sync clone forced into collective CD collection. Of course, music is about fun, and everyone has a right to listen to whatever they desire, but as these cookie cutter starlets achieve the bulk of our interest and music dollar an ever growing number of musicians making music from the heart are stymied and left in the shadows. Children force fed MTV's definition of music will never know the joy of listening to a real masterpiece that transcends mere trend to become a anthem for any generation. I plead with you, take an interest in music and pursue it. Listen to Jazz, Blues, Classical, and anything you like, but make sure you decide what YOU listen to. Don't let the record companies looking to make maximum profit from minimal effort decide for you.

      I just bought tickets to what I'm sure will be a very crowded viewing of "Spiderman 2" tonight. I'm sure some hick will think he's the only person in the building and offer his brilliant commentary on every painstaking moment of the film. In hopes that perhaps, that very redneck somehow has access to the internet and is viewing this blog right now, I would just like to remind everyone that talking, taking phone calls, and otherwise annoying your fellow movie enthusiasts is considered a faux pau.  The last time I was at the show, a family of three with no shoes walked in half way through. They sent their child of four years old to ask for candy from others, and then proceeded to call friends to brag about skipping out on the movie they payed to see and watching this one for free. This thing isn't common in my area, and I was rather surprised. If you have ever done this, please, refrain from entering public in the future for any reason and form an equestrian society in the woods behind you house.
