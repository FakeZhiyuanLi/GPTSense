        Caedmon's Call    No one would love me  if they knew all the things I hide  My words fall to the floor  As tears drip through the telephone line   And the hands Iâ€™ve seen raised to the sky  Not waving but drowning all this time  I'll try to build an ark that they need  To float to you upon the crystal sea   *Give me your hand to hold  'Cause I can't stand to love alone And love alone is not enough to hold us up  We've got to touch your robe  So swing your robe down low  Swing your robe down low   The prince of despair's been beaten  But the loser still fights  Death's on a long leash  Stealing my friends to the night   And everyone cries for the innocent You say to love the guilty too  And I'm surrounded by suffering and sickness So I'm working tearing back the roof   Repeat *  And the pain of the world is a burden  And it's my cross to bear  And I stumble under all the weight I know you're Simon standing there  And I know you're standing there

        Kalapana    Here comes the night Once again I'll be feeling lonely Oh, if only things could work out like you plan Where can love be Tell me why it's so hard to find somebody Who will stand by me And take the time to understand And show me love again  I want the real thing Or nothing at all I need someone that I can be sure will catch me If I should fall Someone who'll be there when I call Then I'll know that it's the real thing I want the real thing To warm me each night Someone to love me over and over Making the future bright Someone who'll be there when I call Just give me the real thing  Where is the moon? Won't it smile On just one more dreamer Let your beams come down And fill my empty room Here comes the night But if there's still a chance  That love can find me I'll be here Crossing my fingers  I want to know for sure That I can feel secure Knowing I've found an everlasting love And once I get that under control Then I won't let go

        Frank Sinatra    I can only give you love that lasts forever, And the promise to be near each time you call, And the only heart i own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all. I can only give you country walks in springtime, And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall, And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all. There are those i am sure who have told you, They will give you the world for a toy. All i ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy. If you're wond'ring what i'm asking in return, dear, You'll be glad to know that my demands are small. Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.

        Sting    If he loved you Like I love you I would walk away in shame I'd move town I'd change my name  When he watches you When he counts to buy your soul On your hand his golden rings Like he owns a bird that sings  When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings  The priest has said my soul's salvation Is in the balance of the angels And underneath the wheels of passion I keep the faith in my fashion When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings  I'm still in love with you [I'm gonna find a place to live Give you all I've got to give] When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings  If I could break down these walls And shout my name at heaven's gate I'd take these hands And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate Cathedrals are broken Heaven's no longer above And hellfire's a promise away I'd still be saying I'm still in love  He won't love you Like I love you He won't care for you this way He'll mistreat you if you stay  Come and live with me We'll have children of our own I would love you more than life If you'll come and be my wife  When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings  I'm gonna love you more than life If you will only be my wife I'm gonna love you more than life If you will only be my wife I'm gonna love you night and day I'm gonna try in every way

        Nirvana    One baby to another said, I'm lucky to have met you I don't care what you think Unless it is about me It is now my duty to completely drain you A travel through a tube And end up in your infection Chew your meat for you Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss From my mouth to yours because I like you   With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil You've taught me everything Without a poison apple The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student Indebted and so grateful - Vacuum out the fluids Sloppy lips to lips You're my vitamins because I'm like you
