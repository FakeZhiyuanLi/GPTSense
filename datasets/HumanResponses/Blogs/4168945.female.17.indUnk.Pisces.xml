      Hey well sorry i havent poted in like a week things really have been hecktic I think i left off riiiight before Phan. kicked in so I'll bring ya all up to speed. OK. I went to Phandamonium...sp? oh well no one cares but anyhoo i went there LATE saterday evening. I chatted with N.D.P Comics. There a big American Manga companny and school based in Seatle thats run by two sisters. OK So I chatted with them and everything was GRRRREAT! They really really liked my manga AHHHHHHH!!! I STILL CANT GET OVER THAT AHHHHHH! It was a photo coppy of my originals which were a liiitle sloppy cause ( little secret) I spent all that morning and afternoon fixxing it i e typing up the text and cutting and pasteing it into liiilte bubbles. ALL BY HAND.... which is also how said ink incident occured...oi.. anyhoo they told me my inking was a llliiiiiitle rough ( A litle as in very) but i explained that it reallly was just a rough kinda sort of final draft. They REALLY dont want me to do my first issue over again but I will cause I KNOW i can make it better. But once is SOOO enough. ( lazy) I'm not ganna change any story or layout just inking. same poses.. all that yada yada. SO after she critiqued my art she said she'd read it that night and get back to me in the morning. er afternoon as it was OH by she I mean Danelle.. PLEEESE let that be spelled right......... GOD i'm SOOOOOOOOOOOO bad at spelling ( Thus the typed text lol) anyhoo I had to wait till the next day ERRRRRRRRRRRR...GRRRRRRR.... uuuuugh ok so next day I woke up my friend and we tottled over she said she was sceptical cause usually someone has good art but sucky conversation or visa versa but she realllly liked mine she said I had good flo and the speech sounded normal. Two conversations stood out for her the first one was the one that goes like this. Hikazu: " Hell No!" guy ( STILL havent thought of a name for him... any suggestions?) anyhoo Guy: Says: " Why?" thinks " Why is that her answer for EVERYTHING?"  and second conversation guy : " You're really very rude you know that?" Hikazu: " Uuuuuuu I'm rude? You kidnap ME and take my cloths andI"M the rude one?" she liked those and some other parts but i dont wanna give out tooo much storyline juuust yet. ok ok So they want 3 issus. by the next time i see them. they also would like me to go to Sakura con in Seatle in April .. YAY! this is how she put it Giant Con 4,ooo people attending !!!! WOW!! ok for some ppl thats nothing but i'm used to about 30 or 40 ppl max at a con here. sooooo WOW! I'd sooooo get lost. I'm pretty sure I'm going....but not totally sure yet. Ok so thats it for that.. um I also won a cup and she gave me a book about Vampires....oooo Creeeeepy...but nice art just creeeepy art. ok after that OH! I almost forgot!!! My cousin Martha came to visit!!!! YAY YAY YAY!! SHES SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL and she hellped SOO much with the text glueing.... so I'm dedicateing one of my issues to her. If Diamond likes me... BIG IF .. ooo I'm scarrred!!! Ok OkOk next... ummmmmmmmmm OH HELL is comeing. Also known as School. UUUGH in two days 2 TWO! TWO FRIGGGING DAYS! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yeah I'm NOT thrilled EXCEPT! i'll be in school while my brother Brian Visits..

I dont really know how to fix that... so i'll just pray I dont screw up cause if I do ur stuck withthe typo overtype is just to friiiging weird and hard to deal with.. oh about that ouch well i was in Martial Arts yester day and i was kneeing and ooooooow i hit that little bone in the wrist right on my kneee in that little spot just right of the bone where theres no bone there oh itas on my left knee by the way.. lol sooo because of that i cpuldn't do Kali WAAAAAAAAA!!! * TEARS* I LOVE martial arts ALL kinds but I'm reallly getting the hang of Kali. OH by the way I practice Jeet Kune Do if you were wondering. SOOO now I have to wake up bright and early tmorow to go to Kali in the morining I think its at 10:00 but not sure....

And the guy with the hand lololololo or should I say withought the hand hahahaha ahhh OH I think I;'m goiung to shooot my PS2 I wanted SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO damn badly to play Devel may cry 2 BUT it wouldn't play... stupid thing. But I did FINALLLY beat Tales of Destiny Two YAY YAY YAY!!! That game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DAMMMN COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL NAMCO I LOVE YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was sweeeet I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recomend playing that that one and Primal for PS2 OH ToD2 is a playstation 1 game. FYI Primal is sooo friiging AWSOME!! Its about this girl Jen who can transform into different deamon forms and she kicks ass with different attacks and weapons in each. You can freely transform betwwen the forms and her humanity at will once she has them. Screes cool toooo AWWWW lets seee I'll try and put up a link for that Game and Tales of DEstiny 2 too Oh and TOD was sooo awsome that they made it into an Anime HA! Isint that SWEET its originally called tales of Phantasia I think... ill find a site for that too. The main vharacters are Reid ( boy) Farah ( girl) Keel ( boy) and meredy ( girl) Ok this one starts out as Reid going throug the forest to find Farah there childhood friends... must have been in the first one... oh well anyhooo they are up in this tower looking at Celestia and Celestia is an upside down world hanging in the sky!! COOL sooo down from Celestia comes a ship. The run to the site and find Meredy there they really dont put two and two togetter until a liiitle while into the story mostly cause shees sooo cute and everyone thinks Celestions are evil huge monsters that eat ppl. Ok well she stars speaking a bizar language. And some freakky gfuy comes after her. so they er youi fight the freakky guy and ger kiked out of the village by the villedge head dude. So they arte trying to take Meredy somewhere safe but they cant understand her soo thaey take her to see another childhood friend Keel. Hes a SMART schollor and Cramel mage! so they think he can understand her. Anyhooo some things happen and Keel decides that shes a Craymel Mage cause she speaks the Melnics language. Wich is the langusage sspoken to use the Craymel arts. So he can speak a l;iiitle but nhot enough So they decide to go to Keels tutor Professor Mazet WEL yada yada stuff happens fight some freeeky ppl and u find profesor Mazet now he gives them these tjings called ORZ earings that allow the friends to comunicate with meredy. Now it gets interesting turns out Meredy is a Celestian and she came rto Inferia to collect the greater craymels so she can combine them with the craymels of Celestia and stop the grand fall. Whats the grand fall? well remember how celestia is above inferia? well the two weorlds are seperated by this thing called the Orbis Barrior. And the Grand Fall is shrinking the Barrior ultimatly the barior will deteriorate and the two worlds will collide!!!!!!!!! WOW so thats what ya gatta do colect the greater Cramels Fight TONS of FRIGGING BAD ASS BAD guys Solve Puzzels and Go through the Seyfert Trials!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And just maybe pull off the difficult task of saveing the two worlds.!!!!! OH and this one is 3 discs long real time battle no turn takeing AWSOME art and BEAUTIFUL graphics and the character TALK! Imagine Final fantassy with No tyrns talking ppl and ummm well the rest is a surprize!! Ok soo now Primal I'll try to keep this one shorter OK Jen.. Shes attacked! in a night club allly way by some huge thing! Shes found later and taken to a hospital the doctar says she has maybe a 50% chance of living.. theyu found her boyfriend a few blocks away hes in bad shape real bad shape. Ok soo now thjis little imp walk in the room and hold his hgands infront of jen say ahhhhhhh and oooooooooo as golden sparks fly the imp hides and jen.... steps out of .. herselfe? so apparently the inp is a gargoly named .. well you can call him scree. Jen is in Astro projection form and needs to be taken to the Nexus! She gears up and crakes a few jokes only to find herself a pon in a major war!!!!! she is fighting on the side of Arella and must go to the city off..... ummmm it starts with an a a C i think... or an A not sure anyhooo she goes there and Scree expects her to fight? WHAT but jen is a humane gilr! how can she fight? soo they wander around run into the king who wont give up his crown to his sun and thus us casteing his whole relm into chaos! So who's Jared again? Why does he keep calling her half breed and whats with the Vampbraces? And if she fixes this relm does she hafe to go to the other 3? and what about Lewis her Bf? well play the AMAZEINGLY great and sometimes difficult game of Primal, And find out ! You'll LOVE IT! ok..its ummmm 10:40 at night and i've got other stuff to do i'll try to find some linkage chow!

      ok so i'm writing a manga! hence all the inking lol for those of you who dont know a manga is kinda like a comic but different in lots of ways. Manga's usually express more emotion and nooo subject matter is taboo. oh and its read right to left. I recoment Cardcaptor Sakura or MARS or Vampire Game for beginers.  side note* ok ok i officialy looove Jing.. And Scudelia Electro.... They've achieved CCS equality wich is very dificult to do...

      so what's up with everyone in the world? lets see i'm cuddling with my cat listening to shout it loud &amp; since yesterday Scudelia electro! yeah! soooo i took a break from inking to blog... let's see i woke up... took a shower... lol interesting thing i broke the shower door oooooooppps xp the shower has two sliding glass doors. it slides by having these small wheels on a track above and below the doors. lol well the top one was off the track so it wouldn't slide very well. sure no prob i could fix that! hehe... yeaaah no.. i sort of fixed the top but the top frame was off so i had to craw back in the shower/bath and push up and out for that . that wasn't tooo bad but when i tried too move it lol the bottom like swung out! soo i tried to fix that pop the top stick it to the bottom back to the top and stick the top back on.. easy... lol k it stayed for like two seconds... then dangled from the right hand corner.... i was inside the shower though ahhkkkkk i got stuck lol ok so i'm standing in the shower (after just takeing a shower) so i couldn't call dad for help... i couldn't move the damn top it got stuck... so my only option was the VERY small slit. i could fit through sideways... but i couldnt get my head through lol so i'm like halfway in halfe out with my face sqished ahainst the wall.. lol luckily for me the hols tappered down into a liddle wider at the bottom.. kinda like a right triangle turned on the short leglol thank god i'm small... it was a tight fit but i got out ! yeah!!!! lol so that was interesting.... and i spilled black ink alllll over my hands lol so there completly black and grey ha! i'm a bit of a clutz today!....
