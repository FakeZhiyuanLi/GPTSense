      Today, it hasn't worn off.  I'm less manic about it, but my mind is still bursting with books to read, and things I have to reteach myself.  I'm heading out now, to look for a new blank book, and to the craft store to look for something to sculpt a new set of runestones out of.  My old ones were discs of clay that I hand shaped, but I can't find them.  I found one, lone rune.  This has gotta be some kind of sign.  The rune is Kaun, the torch.  The rune of the craftsman, it stands for determination, ambition, inspiration...

      It felt like cleaning house, but in my brain.  I had my epiphany, today, maybe last night.  Either way, it fully sank in, today sometime.  All my old books.  All my lessons, candles, insence, thoughts, feelings, ties to the Old Ways, everything had gone dusty and disused.  Blame it on stress, blame it on imbalance, blame it on seeking too far, and leaving my truths behind.  Hell, I have no idea.  Whatever happened, I had somehow shucked off my spiritual wings, and let my personal power fall by the wayside.  My books had gone dusty, and some missing.  I even threw one or two away, I think (!!)  So, last night, I was looking for something to read, to numb my brain to sleep.  I grabbed Scott Cunningham's Living Wicca off my shelf, and took it to bed with me, expecting to do the usual, read a few pages and pass out.  I was up till 4 a.m.  I finished 150 pages of it, before my body finally shut down.  Even as I drifted off to sleep, with a prayer of thanks to the Goddess on my lips, I was mentally charged.  My brain was zinging with energy, that I haven't felt in five years or more.  Today, I ripped through the last 50 or so pages, soaking up every word like a thirsty flower, or a parched ground.  That was when it hit me.  The things missing from my life.  The Goddess, The God, my sense of spiritual self, my Truths, my power, my Old Ways that I once doted upon and cherished.  They're back now.  Tonight, I ransacked the house, in a frantic fervor to dig up my texts, my books, my comforting friends, my writings, my Book of Shadows, and my objects of power.  Lucky for me, I discovered about 99% of them.  I'm still out one book, and my old Book of Shadows is defiantly missing, but here I sit amidst about 20 books.  That pleases me.  I'm over my Book of Shadows.  I have to make a new one.  The old one will have lost it's oomph.  It wasn't doing something, for me, else I wouldn't have slipped off like that.  I feel  right  again.  I feel whole.  I feel like a teenager.  I really do feel like I did when I started on my Path.  Filled with passion, and thirst, love, and wonderment.  There is so much...I don't know...energy?  For lack of a better word.  It's spilling out!  I had to channel it into writing!  I haven't really written in 6 years or more.  Inspired by a few friends, and this was something I had been meaning to do for months, I started a blog.    Here it is.  The results of my epiphany.  More to follow!

      This afternoon, I visited a chatroom that I haven't been to in a year or more.  I used to be a regular there, and just got bored with it, as I inevitably do with all online communities.  Well, I followed a friend in there today, and it was akin to falling into a time wrinkle...  Like I hadn't even missed a day.  Same group of people, same conversations.  It was just strange.

        Brigid, the great mother goddess of Ireland, represents fertility, childbirth, power, creativity and inspiration. Also known as Brighid, Brigit and Bride, she is credited as a protectress and guardian of children; also a Goddess of fire, the sun, music and medicine.  And I'm Brigid, too.  I could have guessed at that one.  I'm a classic mommy, even when I wasn't a mommy.  Mommy is my natural role in any group of my friends.  I cook for them, I offer motherly sense and wisdom, and my shoulders are soft and very absorbant.    I'm a dark, spicy, mother goddess.  Yes I am.

      Having said that, this is sorta important.   Some people have zero communication skills.  "You wouldnt' have the answers.  You wouldn't know what to do.  You wouldn't have the patience to do this"   My mother is coping with serious problems, these days, in my grandmother's old house, in Perth Amboy.  Some asshole mayor is on an urban renewal kick, and forcing all the old-timeys out.  He wants strip malls, where houses and old main streets were.  He wants waterfront condos, rather than an old wharf, and he has a good buddy who owns a development company.  This is all bad news for the people that live there, obiviously.  My grandmother's house was built in 1899, and the moved into it in 1952, as a two family.  In 1962, the last time it was inspected, it was declared a 3 family.  Now, it's a huge house, with 2 smaller houses in the back, 3 big floors, and a huge yard.  My mother had 5 families living comfortably there.  Here's where it gets sticky.  My mother rents to illegal aliens.  People from Poland, Russia, The Czech Republic, and other eastern block nations.  She has one legal hispanic lady, living in the back house with her two kids.  That house hasn't been inspected properly since 1962.  My theory, is that she rents to illeagals, so that no one will sue her if something goes wrong, and if need be, she can just evict them.  The house is clean, and well maintained, there's no doubt, she's there every week, almost every day.  Her tenants are good, quiet and clean, and the rent is low.  SO FAR it's been a good situation, though less than legal.  Then came the lawsuit.  The neighbor was visiting someone, and tripped on a piece of uneven cement on the property.  He sued.  The insurance company is handling it, but this sparked all sorts of problems.  First, my mom had to replace all the uneven stonework in the back yard, and rather than hiring a paving company, and doing it right, she hired day-workers to haul bags of cement back there, and do it half-assed.  The job was a big one, and took all summer.  It looks good, and they did a passable job, but do you think any permits were aquired?  Haha, my mother never gets permits for anything.  Then, one of the neighbors tipped the town off about all the work being done, and an inspector showed up.  The job was fine, and all, but the guy inspected the houses, too.  Found two more apartments than there were permits for (one of the back houses was an apt built in the 70's over a shed, and the other was a converted attic).  NOW, my mom could finally get her head out of her ass, and stop dancing with the law, and do it the legal way, by making the whole place up to code, and therefore infallible.  She could get a loan, make it all *right* and do it up.  It'll be costly, but then they can't bug her about the house.    Or she could fight the town, with a lawyer.  Which she is.  Which is entirely stupid.  Rather than spending the money on righting the wrongs, she's hiring a lawyer with some convoluted idea of trying to prove that the third floor was an apartment long before 62, and that the inspector was sorely mistaken.   After I listened quietly to her rant, I was like, ah, well we all have issues with the town (more on my problems in a future rant) best to just spend the money now, and make everything perfect, so that they can't get to you again about things.  Make them happy, or they'll force you out, somehow.  She argued with me, and challenged me to do better than she is.  Hence the above quote.  Blegh.    It sounds narcissistic, but I know with 100% surety that I could do better, given the experiences I'm having with my own domiciles.

      Aha, "he's hot"  just came to me.  There are a few different variations of hot.   There's like movie star, art, the statue of David "hot" that when I admire, I look at the person like they really are a piece of art.  Pretty.  Rare.  Distant.  No touchy, and I wouldn't want to.  Johnny Depp is art-hot.  I could stare at him all day.  Purely physical beauty.  Then, there's hot, like HOT, like totally do-able.  These types show up in every day, like the guy you see on line at the grocery store, or the guy laying shingles on the roof next door.  I have unique ideas about what characteristics makes a guy "hot"  Most people are floored by who I drool over.  Generally personality or the way they carry themselves figure in more than actual looks.  I want to give examples, but I'm racking my brain for someone famous, and I'm coming up with nil.  Maybe Pete Steel.  He's a fucking animal.  Lots of people think he's ugly.  I don't get it. My piercing guy, Turin.  No one but me seems to think he's attractive.  I don't get it.

      For every stupid piece of insulation that I have to staple into the roof rafters, and stupid nail I smash into, trying to contort up there, I realize I'm one baby step closer to living in my new house.  It makes a thoroughly shitty job a bit more bearable.  I just wish I didn't have a fucking hangover.  Every time I hop off the ladder *woooosh* the world does a carwheel and I gotta cling to my own knees, to keep from falling off.  Oh, and I stink.  It's hot up there.  I smell like what garbage would smell like, in hell.  Blaaagh, thank gods we ran out of staples, otherwise I'd still be up there.  Home Depot isn't far.  He'll be back soon, then back up in the hole.    Oh, and no more drinking for Lili.  THIS TIME I MEAN IT, goddammit.     Hehe, that reminds me of when I was talking to Opti on the phone, a while back, and did a shot, almost vomited, said "agh that sucked, no more" giggled, and took a shot 5 minutes later.  I'm such a masochist.

      Not a lot of time, for musing and writing today.  One thing that I've been stewing about for 5 or so minutes, though:  Why don't guys take girls all that serious, when it comes to music?  Someone made a comment last night to the effect of "Oh you just like that guy because you think he's cute" regarding one of my favorite artists.  Heh, I liked him long before I ever saw his picture (he is attractive, but that's got no bearing on his musical talent).  Why can't I be serious about music?  I am.    I was gonna say something about what the term "he's hot" means.  But it just now slipped out of my mind.  It'll come back.

      So can we have *this* without any of *that*?  Or is *that* inherent to *this*?  That will always be there, but can we still do this, without that interfering?  STAY TOOOOOOONED!

       REMOTE   I love the sanctity of this half hour.  I'm writing in the car again, waiting in the school parking lot.  My little bubble of sanctity in this big plump bass kickin pimptastic Caddilastic.  Voltaire is the music of the moment (I guess one can never really shake an addiction) I'm sure you can hear it three minivans away.  Good.  Call it my way of exposing the masses of white trash soccer moms to a little dark culture.     Whoaooaaah dead girls like meeeehehee  Broadening their horizons, if you will.  I'm singing right along, too.  They must seriously want me locked up.  Ok, so that's what this really is.  A bubble.  Everyone can see in, and hear what I'm up to. I'm on a mini stage, and the audience ain't happy.  I'm at perfect peace, and I feel their stares.  I half ignore it, half revel in it.   ooOOOOh  "When You're Evil" just came on.  Time to crank it up, and really perform.  See if I can't get the kid on the playground to sing along.

      Sometimes it's better when things don't turn out as planned.  Sometimes, it's too much to ask of life when you schedule things.  It's like, fate telling you something.  Telling you that if it happens, by god, it souldn't be on a friggin schedule.  Things are better with less forethought.

      That Open Relationship thread over on ACF has me thinking.  I could absolutely do it.  Sex is sex and love is love.  If you've reached that point with your mate where your love is perfect, and nothing can wedge in there (not even sexual relations with others) then I think you have what it takes.  I say this, because I've been there. I let him sleep with my best friend, and that was cool.  I okayed it.  It was strange, and it was a great turn on, and there was no weirdness, it was just straight up sex.  He doesn't even really like her that much, heh.  Sex is cheap.  Anyone can have sex.  Sex can be easily simulated.  It's LOVE, that's where the relationship is.  You can't fake love.  You can't replace the person you love with a pocket pussy, or a fling with the neighbor.  I know where his heart is at.  He's not so open about things, on my side.  I don't think he could handle it.  Territorial, or something.  I envy the man.  I was thinking about it recently.  7 years for me, and total, utter monagamy.  Never touched another guy.  Never smelled another guy's aftershave, in that intimate neck sniffing way.  It's not so much sex that I'm envious about, it's just the difference, I guess.

      I wonder how old do you have to be, before you start thinking about being old?  I'm 25, and I have a will.  How fucked up is that?  Death doesn't scare me, but old age does.  That's it.  No more birthdays.  I'm putting the brakes on it right here and now.  Quarter Century Girl.  That's me.  The rest will be anniversaries of my 25th.

      So, I'm next door putting up insulation (YEY they finally delivered!) and jamming along to a Pennywise CD.  Now, Pennywise is one of my all time favorite punk bands, I just adore the energy and message, and it gets me movin every time.  I used to HAAAATE Pennywise.  My friend Jill would play their first album tirelessly (her favorite, and now mine) and I would piss and moan.  Something about it got under my skin.  Rubbed me the wrong way.  Somehow, I stopped to listen to it, and fell in love with it.  Here, 11 years later, I'm still kickin it, with Pennywise.  Amazing what springs from that which you hate.  A metaphor for life, if I ever ran across one.     "Things you've contemplated, the unknown road is one"    The world really opens up, when you stop to interact with what you thought you hated.

       REMOTE   Oh fuck me running, I left the house sans notebook again.  Lucky for me Patricia Cornwell left some purdy blank pages in the back of dissere book.  Anyhoo, where was I-  Oh yeah, this stream of conciousness thing.  First of all, I want to say I type like I talk, but, I'm analyzing myself (and talking to people more, as much as it pains me) and that's not 100% true.  I type how I talk to myself.  I'm still pretty reserved when I talk to other people.  So, this is healthy.  It gets it all out. Purging my thoughts whatever they are, so I don't risk blowing them to the wrong person.  Call it literary masturbation.  I'm just as into it.  Right now, my heart is pounding, my mind is racing, my hands are sweating a little.  My guilty little pleasure.  Shh  *wink*  And that's another thing.  Where did THAT little analogy come from?  What is it with me and sex lately.  I guess the adage is sorta true, the more you get it, the more you want it.  Another of life's funny little cycles.  Or, it could be The Other Thing. That thing that I dare not name.  It's a constant source of mind buzzing-horndog inspiring energy.  I'm afraid, constant reader, that I will not disclose That Other Thing, even here.  It's too big.  Maybe when it shrinks, I can talk about it better.  Right now it's choking me, and filling my head.  Time should be the trick, for that thing.  Haha, what am I talking about, this "constant reader" bullshit.  I had maybe 4 readers, who peeked in there, realized that I'm as dull and babbling as I said I would be (do I lie?  No, I do a lot of things, but I sure don't lie, not even to myself).  So, you've all probably melted away by now.  Good, I can forget about you and move along with talking to myself freely.  If you haven't, that's cool too.  I'm outta paper, there wasn't that much to begin with,  I gotta hop outta the car and grab Wunderkind.  More mental musings, later.  I'm still not out of steam.

Honestly, it's flattering, it really is, and scary.  If I go that way, though, I'd hold back.  Or at least change names to protect the innocent.  Am  I that bad at keeping my private shit private?  I thought I always played my cards close.  Time will tell, I suppose.  I'd ask you what you think, but, *you* don't exist!  OMFG I CRACK MYSELF UP.

       HUGELY GOOD NEWS WOOOOFUCKINGHOOO!!!!!   I got my nose pierced again, today (that's not the good news, wait for it).  My piercer, Turin, and I have a good rapport.  I've been going to him for almost 8 years now, and he's awesome.  Today, we were talking, and he was thinking about going back to school, making piercing a part time thing.  Half jokingly, I said "well, if ya ever need someone to answer the phones..." He looked at me, and said "I'm seriously considering taking on an apprentice, so, we'll have to think about that."  He's the only one that works there, he owns the place.  We?  I guess he meant he and I.  HELL FUCKING YEAH.  You wanna talk dream jobs?  Close to home, good pay, excellent hours, great boss, and it's something I totally love.  I'm floating.  He's got my number, now :)  Oh, and I have a lovely stainless steel ring in my right nostril.  That's good too.  :D

      Woohoo!  Confession time!  So, I'm going to get my nails done this morning. (no, that's not the confession)  The shop where I get them done is CONSTANTLY blasting CMT.   Who woulda thunk, Vietnamese folks, into country music. The duration of the visit is roughly an hour and a half, and for that whole time, I'm watching country music videos.  It used to make my skin crawl.  It's growing on me.  Some of those country music guys are friggin HOT!  Some of the songs, I can relate to.  Like, today, there was this song called Whiskey Girl. It made me smile.  SMILE, people.  Most of it is still total dreck, like there was this Dolly Parton song about Jesus or some shit, that made me want to toss cookies, and there's the standard sappy whiny love songs, but every once in awhile, I hear something I like.  WTF people.  WTF I say.  You know what?  This would make a good ACF post.

      More:  This is a continuation of The Harriet Chronicles.  See down there for clarification.  She's planning this huge bash, in May, for Sis's 75th b-day. Big affair.  They're getting a hall, a DJ, catered, the whole works.  Harriet is positively consumed, to the exclusion of most other things, by this.  Every day, yammering about this DJ and the price of that hall, and who has better food, and themes and colors, and the guest list.  Every day.  While Sis herself is hooked to machines in the hospital.  Tuesday night, she called me about chicken dishes.  What's good for a crowd?  What works for a spring party?  "How's Sis?" I asked.  Fine, and she likes chicken, too.    I'm bothered by this.   It bothers me.  Fin.  Finally.  For now.  I'm sure there will be more about this woman.

       The culmination of three days worth of REMOTE, or bloggings from my car.  This kicks off The Harriet Chronicles.   I wasn't gonna write today.  I don't when she comes to pick up her daughter.  Normally, we get there the same time, and I go hop in her Durango, and we talk.  Well.  She talks, mostly.  So funny, when I hop into her car, or go to her house, it's like I may as well check my personality at the door.  It's all about her, baby.  I'm an accessory in her world, just like everyone else.  She thrives on drama in such a way, it's difficult to put into words.    Her husband is a mild alcoholic.  He's not a roaring drunk.  He's not abusive.  The kids have never seen him drunk, that I know of.  I know he had a real problem before they were together, and early in the marriage.  I would rank him a 4, on a scale of 1-10.  So, once in a blue moon, he'll dissapear and have a few at a bar.  He's so afraid (" he better be afraid, goddammit, he knows I'll kill him" , she says) to come home with it on his breath, he stays overnight at a buddy's house or something.  Like I said, guy's got a problem, but he's not abusive (she is...)  The Harriet Protocol, for the situation is as follows:  She calls him the moment he gets off of work, and confirms that he's on his way home.  She knows it takes him X amount of time to get home.  If he doesn't get home in just that amount of time, all hell breaks loose.  She gets on the horn to all her drama-enabler friends, and the network then calls every bar and cab company within a 50 mile radius.  She hunts him down ( "like the dog that he is" , she says) confronts him wherever, and proceeds to make a HUGE FUCKING SCENE, wherever they are, then drags him home, literally.  Normally, it's over with in 45 minutes.  Like some kind of fucked up well rehearsed play.    Then, she gets BACK on the phone, with all her lame friends, and she's all fucked up about how much her marriage sucks, how her life is in the toilet, general man bashing, and how she "simply can't take this anymore".  She floats around in this hazy funk, sighing, and moaning, and taking off of work "oh, this stress, I can't deal with it".  You can't even get near her, without getting blown over by all the sighing.  Till recently, it was shower, rinse, repeat, about once every two weeks.       Ok, this is the second day I'm working on this.  The Harriet Chronicles.  The irony is, if she knew her name was on a site somewhere, and people were talking, she'd be thrilled.  Anyway, she thrives on this brand of drama and martyrdom.  It would be sickening, but, my own life is drama-free by comparison, so this is all rather amusing.    Third day's the charm, maybe? I had to quit yesterday, because she materialized at my car door.  Good thing I'm scribbling this, otherwise she may have been able to decipher it over my shoulder.  On with the story:  Monday morning she shows up in the AM all distraught.  Her Aunt Sis (whom they live with) had been rushed to the ER the night before.  Chest pains.  That's scary.  She's 74 years old.  I'm genuinely concerned, here, she's a good woman.  "Keep me posted, please"  Tuesday comes, and from the moment I see her, she's going on and on and on about some work bullshit.  I had to stop her mid deluge, to inquire about Sis.  *blank stare*  It took her a minute.  "Oh.  OH!  Yeah.  Pneumonia.  Yeah, she was admitted last night." Right back about how this guy at work is a dick.  Pneumonia is scary, in old people, poor Sis.  My Aunt Mary died from complications of it, around that same age.    I told her that, and she was like "Yah, Sis has had it before, no biggie."  No biggie.

      This is gonna unwind into a saga, I can feel it already... No one I know irl reads this, so I'm not changing any names to protect the guilty and weak.  So, Harriet's husband, John is an alcoholic.  He's now in recovery.  After drama after drama, and her running to his rescue then threatening to throw him out, and the threat of divorce, and so on, he's gotten himself on the ball.  Counceling twice a week, AA meetings, the whole bit.  Grats to him, it takes a big man to admit addiction and get over it.  SHE'S got her head SO FAR up her ass, I can't even believe it.  Just got off the phone with her, and get this, a direct quote:  "I know the meetings are helping him, and all the councelling shit, but I just don't want to hear about it.  I'm so not interested in his life.  I try to pretend to care, but I don't.  As long as he stays clean, what the fuck do I care what he does?  Soooo boring...."    Am I the only one who notices how wrong that is, on so many levels?  How totally unfair?  Well, honestly, you don't know the situation, so I can't ask that.  I'm working on presenting it here, though.  I've been working on THe Harriet Chronicles, in my car, day to day.  She is a source of much of my ponderings.  She is a psychologists' wet dream.    When I tidy it up, and finish that one part, I'm gonna start it.  The Harriet Chronicles.  It'll be interesting, you'll see.

      ACF again, hehe.  That thread with the girl.  Naturally, it dissolved into a pro-anti piercing thread.  Close mindedness:  When the world has to fit into your standards to be "right".  God, I hate that so much.  When you judge someone's viability as a person, their intellect, their character, based on a simple piece of jewlery placed in a non-standard spot.  Marvellous.    I was on the phone with the mister, when I read that thread, and I had to chuckle out loud.  He asked what I laughed at, and I told him.  Somehow the discussion of my upcoming piercings nose/labret came up.   I think he heard me this time.  I've mentioned it before, dozens of times.  He brushed me off...hahahaha.  Well, this time he might have heard me.    I said "To round out and complete my facial work, I'm getting my nose/labret done all at once.  That'll be it, then I can focus on other parts of my body"   Him:  "WHAT?!  You never said you were..." ME: "Oh, but I did.  I've been planning it since before Christmas" Him: "I didn't think you were serious" Me:  "Heheh.  You never do"  I could go a hundred places with this. I could attempt to plead my case further.  I could try to prove that people DO look past the piercings, and they DO take me seriously.  I could say that the people that make the mistake of brushing me off, upon really meeting me are sorry they did so.    That doesn't matter.  I won't change his opinion.    He said "But Lisa, you're 25 years old, you're not a teenager!", and I said, "Which gives me the power to make decisions for myself, and not have to answer to anyone..."  He was ok with the rest of them. He swings from my nipple rings like any kind of perv.  He loves the tounge ring, and bought me a pretty ring for my eyebrow.  He took me to get my nose done the first time.  Evidently, the labret is just a wee bit too far, and now all bets are off, and he hates every last one of them.  He's gonna have to get over himself, methinks.

      Aaaghhhhgrrrr...  Lured into it again.  Posting the truth on ACF, which I didn't really want to do, and sure enough, I got one guy doing that "holier than thou" thing.  It's never a shock.  I'm only suprised that more haven't done it.  Every fucking time.  I posted it because people wanted my insight, and now some dickhead is using it to get his "moral" rocks off.  If he keeps it up, I'm gonna go there.  That's why I hate pouring my heart out on ACF.  That's why I love this blog so much.  *huggles this page again*

      Well, fucking aye.  I would have a nice juicy semi-daily "Remote" posting, here, but seems that when I was talking with a friend, MY SON LOCKED MY KEYS IN THE FUCKING GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING CAR.  Along with the notebook, purse, etc...  *VENTVENTVENTVENTVENT*  Lucky for me, though, she hadn't pulled away just yet, and I got a ride home.  My vehicle is still at the school.  GRR.  He's sitting in his room, punished, for the day, all privileges stripped.  Now, he's a good boy, and an honest one, which I value.  I asked him WTF was he THINKING, when he locked the doors!?  (as all parents are apt to do)  He said, and I quote "I wasn't in the mood to go home, I figured we could stay here"  Inside I had to chuckle.  Outside I freaked out...YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE??!?!?!?  He did, oh yeah.  He thought we'd just hang out there at the playground, till someone rescued us.  (Did I mention, it's raining...)  And here's me thinking it was some kind of bizarre accident...I should have known better...he is my kid, after all.  He's less clutzy, and more conniving than he lets on.

      Ever just wake up irrationally pissy?  Yeah,  me too.  In fact, today is one of those days.  I was shocked awake, unlike my normal gentle phone call.  That did it, I think.  That, and the boy not running on schedule.  God, It pisses me off so bad in the morning.  He gets his shit together so well, then 5 minutes before it's time to go, his IQ plummets to below 70, and he becomes borderline functional.    "Where's your bag?" "Ummmm..." "GO FIND IT nownownow!" *stare* "GOOOOOO"  He made it to school on time, barely...so, I'm calming down now, but GRRR.

      So, webcams.  I don't want one.  Ever.  I hate being looked at.  I don't really like showing online folks my picture, either.  It's not because I think I'm ugly, I don't, more on that later.    If you need to know what I look like, to decide if you want to be my friend or not, then I don't want to know you.  Online, my mind is my personality.  You can't see the way I walk, or hear the way I talk, truly.  You can't see my gestures or the way I narrow my eyes.  It's all about my mind, the purest form of me.  If what I offer isn't enough, and you must insist that you see the face, then I know where your interests lie, and I can feel how shallow you are.  I have no qualms showing my picture to well established friends, especially if they don't ask.  I do like seeing people's faces as much as anyone, and it's nice to finally associate a personality with a face, but it's soooo not necessary.    My most longterm, possibly best eFriend, Greg, I would say he knows more about me than anyone besides my husband, he and I have never once exchanged pictures.  I couldn't pick him out of a lineup, ditto for him not seeing me.  We simply don't need it.  I'm not ugly.  I'm interesting looking, and I don't know anyone that looks quite like me.  I'm fine with my self esteem, and all that.  I had to really analyze that, because I thought I might be afraid of showing people what I look like.  Not that at all.  Plenty of people have seen me, but it's who I choose.  It boils down to I am not the person you see in the picture.  I am the person that is typing these words.  If the picture means that much, than the words obviously don't.  If you're too lazy to know me, a picture won't help you, it'll just objectify me.  Plus, I hear webcams steal your soul.

      No self control, I have.  Going back to AC, starting fresh on FF.  I'm still debating whether to delete Eye, totally, so I'm not tempted to slip back into the old groove on WE.  I'm not expecting anything different, nothing new or mindblowing.  I just wish for a timekiller, and AC was it, for me.

      THis is driving me crazy.  All these thoughts flit through my brain, when I'm out, when I'm driving, when I first wake up.  Stuff that I think "Wow, that was brilliant, I gotta blog that".  Then, I get here, and *fwoosh* empty brain.  Maybe that's why I always gravitate toward ACF.

We're hooked to machines, baby, and we don't have a choice.  If the machines go down, we go down.  We created this.  We created the machine.  I'm feeling very "End Times" today.

      Gah, it's happening again.  I changed my AIM name, because every time I'd log in under my old one, 2897427493 people would pop on and want to chat.  I can't entertain that many people, on a daily basis, I simply don't have that energy, I do it enough in real life.  So, I changed my name.  Soon enough, lots of people learned my "hiding" name.  Same problem.  So, I moved over to MSN.  Now, every time I get on MSN, I really only want to talk to one or two people, and 5 conversations start up, and here I am netted into talking to a load of people.  It's that whole obligation thing.  I like talking to my friends, and I enjoy having conversations, but when it gets to the point where I feel like I *have* to...gah, that makes me want to delete the program.  I've been feeling it more lately, because I'm online much much less.  Spending whole days (!!) outside, busy as hell with the house, all that.

      To get back into the swing of things, I'll start with the magical Three Things I Did Today:  Thing One:  I called my contractor at 9 a.m. (just like he told me to) and woke him up out of a dead sleep.  I say "Hi, this is Lisa"  He says "LIIIIIIIIIISSSSAAAAAA"  really loud.  His girlfriend comes to the phone.  Apparently, his girlfriend's name is Lisa, too.  Lemme just say this:  27 (more or less) years of smoking pot is bad.  BAD.  Poor old Joe.  Thing Two:  I finalized the design of my kitchen.  The keywords here are  elemental, moden, clean lines, and bold color .  Natural Maple cabinets, very smooth and square looking, full overlay, all that.  Countertops in this color called Ebony Oxide, which is a very dark shade of charcoal grey, with black I dunno...texture looking stuff, looks almost like waterspots, or granite.  It's Formica, I originally wanted Corian, but since I found that Laquer black Kohler sink, and it has to go above the counter, what's the point of blowing 3 grand on Corian?  Right, exactly.  So, yeah.  I picked out a floor, too.  Almost the same as the countertop, this dark dark grey granitey looking linoleoum.  And, here's the kicker.  Laquer red walls.  Like, that Chinese enamaled dragon red.  Dark, rich, modern, warm, mysterious.  Stainless and black appliances.   I'm thrilled.  They finished putting up sheetrock yesterday, now you can actually see where the rooms start and end.  There is a light at the end of this tunnel.  Maybe one day, I'll explain this tunnel of which I speak.  Right now, I'll say, that it's been two years since the house burned, as of April 3.  Two friggin years.    Thing Three:  Uh.  Hm.  I had fun in AC.  I ran allll the way to the start of that river thingy, that flows by Holt, and Crag, and all.  There were some huge monsters out there, scary for my little level 30 self.  It's nice, though, to play and explore, and have the freedom to do whatever I wanna do.  Without having to worry about patrons, and vassals, and guild expectations.  That's really why I quit.  I was tired of being obligated.  Obligated to do this or that for the monarchy.  Obligated to get to a particular level, so I could do this or that with my companions.  I just burned out, I guess.  Now, if only  I can talk Jez into joining me on MT again.  Yeah, MT.  I started again on FF, but it occurred to me, that I already had an apt on MT, and no other ties, really.  The apartment sold me.  It's nice to go home.

      My my my, that just made me grin from ear to ear.  :)  Ally  urlLink (Ally's Blog)  posted a bunch of comments about my thoughts, on her blog.  Hehehehehe, I keep telling myself that it's ok to say whateverthefuck here, because no one reads it.    Well, if it's just Ally reading it, I can still say whatever, hehe, I'm sure nothing could shock her at this point.    Oh, and good luck on the not-swearing, girly.  I could never do it.  You could build a casino on what would go into my swear jar.   Edit:  I'd code that link in to the side somewhere...but I dunno how :'(

      The waiting game is killing me, hehe, but in a good way.  I've been waiting since last summer, to buy a new computer.  Waiting till the house stuff settled down, waiting till after the holidays, then waiting for the tax refund.  It's killing me.  But, it's a fun sort of anticipation.  This computer is a shambles.  It's literally falling apart.  It'll be 6 this year.  6 years old.  That's ancient by computerly standards.  The other thing I'm waiting for, is my iPod.  My mom and husband, are going halfies and giving me the money to buy an iPod (and some of the accessories), for my birthday.  It's soo close, yet so far.   I'm sort of hoping they'll suprise me soon, with the money, so I can order it and have it by the thirteenth.  That would be sweet as hell.  I don't want it for no reason, heh.  I only have a radio in my Blazer, and rather than going all out, and putting in a System, when I got it (like  I do with my other cars) I vowed to hold off, and get an iPod, and the thingy that you need, to play in the car.  I hate the radio soooo much.  It makes me nuts, being without good music day in and day out.  Soon. Soon.  Patience is my middle name.

      What a bizarrre dream.  In a good way.  I woke up feeling good, from it.   I'm gonna write it down.   So, Mike and I are in a relationship.  A serious one, too, very loving.  We're right on the verge of living together, you know, where like half of your stuff is already moved in, you're sleeping together most nights, all that.  I remember the house very distinctly, too.  Strange.  The walls were white, and the carpet was a lot of navy blue.  Big bed, with a burgundy cover, and big dark furniture.  So, Mike's got people coming over, to play cards.  I'm in the bedroom changing from my clothes in a backpack, trying one outfit after another.  I settled on a navy blue tee shirt, and some dark cutoffs.  By the time I was done, all the people were downstairs playing cards, and Mike was in the kitchen getting some stuff to bring down there.  There was a knock at the door.  It was the police.  I jetted downstairs, trying to escape out a basement door, or the garage or something. Mike answered the door, and turns out they were looking for me because one one unpaid parking ticket.  I was running around downstairs trying to get through all the people to escape, but they had their stupid card table pushed up against the door.  I was climbing over it, when Mike grabbed me around the middle, and hauled me upstairs to the cops.  He was all like "I can't believe I loved a criminal, you disgust me, we're finished" It was that dramatic.  So, the cops hauled me away.  Fade to prison.  I just get placed in this tiny cell, it's roughly the size of my desk, with just enough room for a bench and a bucket, and just enough to stand and turn around.  It was smack in the middle of this huge building that was mostly underground.  Everything was beige, and lit with torches.  The guard was juuust about to clink my door shut, when a riot starts, and I manage to escape.    Fade to me being outside, and escaping.  I'm barefoot for some reason, and trotting across a giant parking lot.  Also, everything's beige, sky, ground, everything.  Very strange.  The parking lot was totally deserted, too.  Mike appears out of no where on this hovercraft.  He pulls up, and I just shot him a look, and kept running, barefoot.  He was like "look, I'm sorry, maybe I was too hasty, you need a ride"  So, I hopped on.    He said "Since it's Halloween, I decided to go camping, wanna go?"  Sure.  He hovercrafted to a nearby forest, where there were little bonfires everywhere, and people partying.  He pulled up near this huuuuuge winnebago, with a little campfire next to it, and people everywhere.  They were having a Halloween party.  We went inside, and there was candy EVERYWHERE, but it seemed illeagal.  Like, candy was outlawed, or something.  It was a party drug.  I swept off this couch-bench thing to lay down among the chaos,  and just then the park rangers knocked on the door.    Then I woke up.

       REMOTE    Let's talk about perfume for a minute.  Personal scent:  It should be an understatement.  I like to think of it as a gift to people you like enough to stand close to.  It should enhance your presence, a little, by being a joy to other's senses of smell.  What it should NOT do:  Announce your presence before you physically arrive, nor linger for 20 minutes after you've left.  It should not spread in a 30 foot radius assaulting the olifactory gland of any innocent bystanders.  It shouldn't be detectable UP WIND or OVER THE PHONE.  Perfume should not speak louder than you.  I think people who marinate in their scent are the same ones that talk too loud, and otherwise insinuate themselves on others.  It's probably all subconcious, but there's a definite pattern of behavior here.  This rant brought to you by Harriet, who mentioned in a conversation, the other day, "...once a year?!  You only have to buy a new bottle of perfume once a year?!  Jeezus, I have to get a new one every three weeks!"  *shudder*  At least, though, in her credit, she wears quality stuff.  My above rant goes TRIPLE for people who buy their eu de toilette at the grocery store, or at a dollar mart.

      Example:  I just called him and said "I need a binder for the rental stuff, the dogs need food, we need milk, and I need some new office supplies"  He said "Take $300 from the business envelope, and while you're out, grab me some new pens"   That kind of financial freedom, I love.

      I hate it when the mister says "So, what's on your agenda for tomorrow?"  (and he does, almost every day) because half the time, I really don't have anything planned.  I just take things as they come, and I wind up getting stuff accomplished.  I don't like saying "Umm, nothing, why?" because he either smirks at me, and acts like "Oh, nothing?  You're not planning on doing anything tomorrow?" with sort of a 'tude, as he looks around the house.  OOR, he'll say something totally off the wall like "Good, you know that 9 yards of mulch in the driveway?  Can you spread it over where the azalea bushes are planted?"  or some other ridiculous task.  When I say "No plans." I mean doing my day-to-day routine, which includes, meeting with the contractor, and whatever inspectors decide to show up, often a trip or three to Home Depot for supplies, 5,000 phone calls and various daily odd tasks that keep his business running smooth (I spend more time on the phone with customers, than a telemarketer, it seems) bookkeeping, AND being a mother and a housewife on top of all that.  So, tack on the daily duties of raising an exeuberant five year old, cooking 3 meals a day, doing crazy amounts of laundry (the mister changes his clothes 3 times a day.  Street clothes, highway dept. uniform, and his own work clothes) with no dryer, and now, packing a few boxes every day.  A few weeks ago, you can add cutting and installing lengths of insulation.  Next week, add paining and priming to that list.  Oh, and general upkeep of this and the other house.    When I DO have plans, I'll say something like "Yeah, I have to go give two people estimates, grocery shopping, and bake 3 dozen cupcakes, oh, and I'm getting my nails done"    Nowadays, I just fucking INVENT plans for myself, to avoid the smirk, and to avoid plans being made FOR me.    See, the problem is,  he works two jobs, right?  Till 3 he works for The Monmouth County Highway Dept. as a Heavy Equipment Operator.  From 3 till whenever, he's his own boss, as a landscaper.  In season, he's gone from 7 a.m. till dark.  (Dark in the summertime can be as late as 9 p.m.)  He's a workaholic, he gets very antsy if he's just sitting around.  No patience to read, or chill, or mess with a computer.  If it's not making him  a profit, it's a waste of time.    My job?  I'm his personal assistant, in a way.  I do allll the administrative whatevers for his business, and take care of every single other thing in this household, so that he can work 16 hours a day, and everything runs smoothly.  I'm his PR person, his secretary, receptionist, appointment setter, soon to be landlord, maid, chef, personal massage therapist,  and so on.  I work from home, so he thinks I do nothing.  He respects people that "go out and work, for a living" but, when I offer to go get a *real* job, which I would LOVE to do (only if it relieved my duties here) he's like "Who's gonna do the bookkeeping?"  Right, exactly.    I guess I feel unappreciated.  He doesn't notice what I do, because I do it so well, y'see?  If he DID notice things, it would only be because I failed to do them.  Does he think about credit card bills, or how his jobs get lined up?  Does he have to double check on clean socks for the next week? Does he have to stop and wonder if the orders for parts and equipment were placed, or if the checks will bounce?  Is he worried that his lunch won't be packed for the next day?  Nope.  Yet, when I tell him I don't have anything planned, he spazzes out.  So, now I have to detail every single little thing that I do.  There's a few things I don't do, however. One is dishes.  I do the daily ones, but I don't do them after dinner.  Two is *most* yard work.  For years my mom forced me to do her shitty yard work, to the point of being abusive about it.  I like having a nice garden, and I work in my own little flowerbed and herb garden, but if he wants to have a hugely landscaped yard (which we do) then it's his job to maintain.  Won't touch it.  Oh, and I don't get paid, that's the other thing I don't do.  One nice aspect to not getting paid is, I can take extra money and go out and buy stuff on a whim.  It's an ok deal, and I get no guilt.  If I had a "real" (haha) job, I'd have my own pocket money to go out to lunch with, or get my nails done, or splurge on a new game or some books.  So, once in awhile, I'll do just that.  I feel I'm justified.  I'm not spendy, though, or some kind of compulsive shopper, but I do like to get things when I want them.  If I set my heart on a new game, or a new jacket or something, and it doesn't happen right away, I get antsy.  Like, I work my ass off, and I can't even have a few bucks to buy some new clothes?  WTF.  It seldom happens, though.  Because I'm not a girly type of shopper, and because I very very seldom get told no.

      Opportunities come from the strangest places.  So, I'm looking for a renter, for the house I'm living in.  I figure $1000 will be a good ballpark.  I'm telling people $1200, though, but, I'm willing to bargain.    So far, my two best offers:  The guy that works at Lowes, who's selling me my cabinets.  He used to live in town, but now he lives in Keansburg, the next town over, and it's generally recognized that Keansburg is a slum.  He wants back in Union Beach bad.  He's flinched a little at the price, but he said he'd talk it over with his girlfriend.  The other offer, and this one came outta left field, was from my contractor of all people.  He used to live in town, and, you guessed it, now he lives in Keansburg, yeah he wants back in too.  He likes our house a lot, perfect for him and his girlfriend.  Ok, here's the kicker.  To get a Cert. of Occupancy, I have to replace the heating and electrical.  Big $$, roughly 10 grand.  That we didn't budget for, in this loan.  He said he'd do any painting, and cleaning up or whatever.  I quoted him $900, for rent "as is" and he got excited.    I like the guy, our relationship has been strained, at times, but it's not him, it's the situation.  He's a decent guy, we've known each other for awhile, I've got no problem whatsoever renting to him.    The only thing is, is it worth the risk doing it "under the table" like?  Without a Cert. of Occ?  We'll get one eventually, as a matter of fact, I told him we would upgrade everthing if he promised to stay at LEAST a year.  He said "If things work out, we'll stay there at least 10 years, I hate moving" .    The mister is a little patchy about it, but, then again it's not his decision, it's mine.  It's my job, this whole renting thing.  I'm gonna have to sit down with a calculator, and work out hard numbers, to see if it's worth it, to take the cut in our price, and upgrade things eventually.

      I made an interesting discovery about blogging.  Often, throughout the day, I'll think of something brilliant to muse over, here, "OMG, I must blog that, I'll do it when I get home!"  Then this or that happens, and when I actually do get in front of this thing, it just doesn't seem all that brilliant.  It's almost as if, these thoughts (besides remote, that is) are what hits me, when I'm sitting here, or bored at home.  I should put more effort into Remote.  I keep a notebook in my car, and I use it when I have to wait somewhere.  I need to use it more.  Just for one line notes to myself, so I don't forget.  I was gonna type about my bizarre spending habits, and my new addiction to Morrowind (bought because of my bizarre spending habits) but, now it doesn't seem all that important.  But, what is?  This isn't about important.  I'm keeping this blog, because I like talking to myself, typing things out helps me get things straight in my head, and it's a nifty little cross section of life, to look at.  Snapshots of my days.  Mental photo album.

      What a weird situation this could blossom into.  My son is over there yammering away to The Neighbors From Hell, and he has been, for a good long time.  We hate TNFH.  They're the Devil.   They're Legion.  Picture this:  Something like 4-7 kids, all related somehow, living together, with a sometimes parent on the premesis.  They're all older now, and honestly things have gotten better, but about 4 years ago, it was sheer hell.  They ranged in age from 7-15.   But, there were no PARENTS LIVING THERE.  The dad would pop by occasionally, but besides that?  I'd see them lugging groceries home on foot, and riding their bikes to the laundermat.  Yeah.  I should feel sorry, right?  I would, I tried, but shit, they're such animals.  Where should I start?    They killed my rabbit, and maybe one (possibly two) of my dogs.  The younger kids would throw a bunch of shoelaces tied together with a huge fishing hook at the end, over the stockade fence into my yard.  Once, they hooked it in my rabbit hutch.  My rabbit ate it, and died.  I'd be sitting in the yard, and *woosh* over the fence would come this long string, with a hook.  Sometimes into the dog pen, sometimes right into the fish pond.  In that time frame, two of my dogs turned up dead.  One would eat ANYTHING, seriously.  She was youngish, only 6, but she chewed on everything.  There was bits of string in the pen, and my dog was dead :(  one can only assume.  Another of them died, but he was older, about 10.  It was just *poof* he wasn't sick or anything, but we had no evidence.  They used to throw all manner of garbage out of their second floor window, on to my house (we live about 10 feet apart), anthing from used feminine hygene products, to old food (dishes and all, know how many forks I hit with the lawnmower?), to toy parts, to once, a used condom.  Every time we'd notice something new, we'd go bang on their door, and make one of the kids clean it up.  Turns out, it was just this one girl doing it, the sloppy bitch, rather than clean her room, she'd chuck everything out the window.  They have two dogs and about a billion cats.  One dog is fine, cute little bugger.  The other one is a vicious nightmare.  It's a boxer.  They built this ridiculous enclosure that gave the dog a 3 ft. width of run up and down the stockade fence bordering our yard.  All the dog would do was bark and bark and bark all day long.  It had a thing for our clothesline, too.  It would go NUTS, when we would put clothes on the line (we don't own a dryer).  Our stuff kept dissapearing, too, and, I chalked it up to our carelessness, misplacing stuff whatever.  Till one day, I saw one of our towels hanging over the fence (now, our clothes line is about 10 feet high, and 2 feeet away from the property line).  I went to go grab it, thinking the wind had knocked it over there.  The dog climbed up the fence, and went after me, ripping the towel from my hands.  I got a stepladder, and peered over the fence, and FUCKING LO AND BEHOLD a heap of our stuff out there.   Roughly two loads of laundry, this asshole dog had snatched off the end of our clothesline.  The damn thing climbed up this bowed section of fence, and ripped clothes off the line.   So, I go get the husband, he looks, and puts a hand on the edge of the fence to steady himself, and the dog bites him.  Bites him.  Yes.  Tore three fingers open, and a nice puncture wound on the knuckle.  He's livid, at this point and goes banging on their door, yelling about the laundry, yelling about the dog, screaming at the top of his lungs.  No one came to the door.  He pounded and pounded, and ranted and raved.  He left bloody smears all over the door, the front window, everything.  He hit one windowpane so hard, he broke it.  Yeah, mister temper.  One of the kids finally came to the door, the boy.   All my husband said was "I'll pay for that window, if you want, but, then I'm gonna call the cops about the vicious dog, and where's your dad, anyway..."  The kid mumbled, "Don't worry about it"   Since then, the dog has been on the other side of the enclosure, with three feet of space seperating.  They didn't clean the blood off the front of their house for weeks.  Weeks.     That was all a few years ago.  Since then, the boy's dissapeared, I'm guessing he's in his late teens, now, the oldest one, a girl, has a kid of her own, a baby, and she's maybe 20.  Some of them drive now, thankfully, and we had about 6 different kinds of "authorities" come banging on our door, looking for the father.  Get this, FBI, Union Beach cops, county sheriff, NYPD (that one floored us), DYFS, and someone else, some other bureau.  The father has totally dissapeared.  Those were just some of the more major problems, but I assure you, there have been literally hundreds, over the years.  We don't hate, we just ignore them, mostly, and once in awhile the mister will go off on who ever answers the door.  They apologize, and fix whatever it is.  Their dogs occasionally get into our yard, and we throw bricks at them, or baseball bats.  No biggie.  Things have been quiet, mostly.     Now all of a sudden, my son, the politician, everyone's friend, this boy, is talking to the youngest of them through the fence.  I eavesdropped.  He told them he's afraid of their dogs.  She invited him to come over and play.  I shuddered.  But hey, he can talk to whoever, I guess, it wasn't hurting anything.  I'm not letting him go over there, nohow.  I'm afraid of the dogs, and of what diseases he may contract...plus, they're just skaaaanky.

      I just started playing AC again, right?  I'm enjoying it, because I'm taking things slow, and really getting INTO the game.  Trying quests I've never done, reading lore, keeping a book of detailed information.  It's a nice, different approach.  I used to play to hang out with friends, now, I don't have any friends in game, so I'm doing what I can to keep myself interested.  It's really a fun game, but I think it's all about setting self-goals.  Lately, I've been trying to fill this checklist I made, of housing items.  It's harder than one would think.  Rare drops really are rare.    Here's what sucks, though.  Someone suggested that I would like the game Morrowind.  I looked it up, and it really grabbed my interest.  Now, I'm about to go buy it.  It'll either turn out one of two ways, I can see it now:  I'll love it, and abandon AC again, to play it, or I'll play for a week or so, and get bored like every other game, and go back to AC.

      I got my labret pierced :)  I have mixed feelings.  It's pretty, it makes my lips look beautiful, draws attention to them nicely, makes them almost poutier looking (like I need that...).  But, it's a pain.  If I take big bites, my bottom teeth catch it and get hung up, which right now 7 hours after the piercing...hurts like a bitch.  Sugary things hurt, but that's good, I'm off sugar anyway (couldn't resist a nibble of cheesecake after dinner, and I regretted it) It's behaving much like my tounge piercing.    I was thinking about it.  I wasn't all obsessed about getting this one, like I was with others.  It just seemed like something to do, I guess.  I thought hard about why, though.  I mentioned it offhand, and the mister flipped out.  People flipped out.  My mom, my conservative friends (ewww, they say)  I thought more and more about it.  I kept seeing it on other women and admiring it.  I brought it up again to the mister, and he "put his foot down"  (harhar) and declared it nasty.  I made up my mind to do it shortly thereafter.  Thus is the nature of my way.  I wish people would just learn this about me, the more you try to order me, or sway me, or make me do it "your way"...the less likely I will comply.  It's been like that my whole life.  I also got my nails done, and a pedicure.  I feel sooo pretty :)  I seldom feel even remotely attractive, so this is nice.  It's high time I gave myself a day of spoiling.

      Afelirick's blog (that I wish he'd update more), a link to my favorite band in the universe.  In my previous post, I mentioned Dan and Mindy.  Dan is the lead singer for Core Device.  Great band.  I wish they'd hurry the fuck up with that album, though.  Oh, and ACF, because this page needs a link there.

      I made the decision when I got up this morning, I'm getting my labret done this afternoon.  That'll be aftermarket hole number 11.  I have an MO though.  I want to go show my face around the place, make sure Turin doesn't forget me.  Let him know I'm still VERY interested in becoming his apprentice.    I'm so psyched.  Last night was a typical and untypical Friday night.  Hung out with Mindy, who I haven't seen since September, about.  She's been a good friend of mine for more than 9 years.  I wish we could hang out more.  I wish I wasn't such a hermit.  I wish her boyfriend Dan (who I've also been friends with for 9 years) hadn't evolved into such a shlub.  They're some of my best friends, but I can only stand Dan in small doses these days.  I always have fun when I hang out with just Mindy, though, and we always laugh so much.  Every time we part, I regret not trying harder to keep in touch, and vow that I'll do better.  Came home, and poured myself a huuuuge whiskey sour, and sat down to some good old ACF debauchery.  That was the typical part.  :)  I love ACF, it's my home on the net.  I love the people I've met there.  I even look forward to coming home, relaxing, and seeing what they're all up to.  Drinking every weekend feels a little like it's becoming a bad habit.  But, then I justify it by "well, what the fuck else are we gonna do?  We're broke, with this house thing."  and "At least I'm not going out every night, and whooping it up at a bar" and "It's only maybe 2 or three hours a week, heh, and Alden never EVER sees me drunk"  As long as those stipulations are met, I'm not concerned.

GnuStew: I hope it does something responsible with that password I just sent out GnuStew: my password is my credit card number and my social security number and my drivers liscence number =) IgnorePlz: it just sent it to me, with a list of tasty porn links GnuStew: rock! IgnorePlz: if you see a bunch of charges to hoetails and manhole.com... IgnorePlz: uh IgnorePlz: it wasn't me IgnorePlz: I swear GnuStew: manhole.com!  GnuStew: I love that site! IgnorePlz: lol IgnorePlz: (I'm now checking out manhole.com, out of dire curiosity) GnuStew: its a real site? IgnorePlz: apparently not IgnorePlz: but now I want to buy a domain name...

       Just thought of something else that makes me smile.  When someone is just as happy to see you, as you are to see them.  When you greet someone with genuine exuberance, and get the same in response.  Or, on the same thread, when someone says "I've been thinking about you" and really means it.  That's so nice :)

      In May, some things usually happen.  Mother's Day, my birthday, my dad comes to visit a lot (from Guam, so it's a big deal), and I go into this horrendously depressive funk.  I feel the funk edging in.  No energy, a little weepier than usual.  I know why, I plan on writing about it, but I still can't keep it from happening.  Mother's Day is funny.  Normally it coincides with my dad visiting, so it's awkward.  (My mom and dad HATE each other)  Generally, though, my mom is understanding about it, and I take her out before my dad comes for a visit, and everything is fine.  On the actual day, we go to my dad's folks' house and celebrate with with his stepmom*shudder*.  My dad's parents are a trip.    No dad this year, not in May at least.  So, who knows what we're gonna do.  I used to rack my brains thinking about what to get my mom, heh.  Now, I realize that she doesn't need any more crap, so as long as I'm thinking of her, it's all good.  I stick to consumables, taking her out to dinner, flowers, before she was diabetic, I'd get her this extravagant cheesecake from Normandy bakery. I just am expecting to get a ration of shit this year, I don't know why, but I feel it in my bones.  As for me?  Generally I get flowers.  Since my birthday is close, I get the old "birthday and Mother's day" tied together gift.  I'm not a material girl, I have very simple wants, but the fact that absolutely NO thought goes into either of those gifts, is a little offputting.  What I mean is, when I want something (this year it's an iPod) I'll put the word out early.  Saying something like "I really want an iPod, but instead of splurging, I'll wait for my birthday, how's that sound?" And the mister is generally agreeable.  Then he goes out and buys whatever.  Last year it was a digital camera.  It's never something just for me, it's always something for everyone.    The point I'm making is he never has to give it any thought.  This year, he doesn't even have to get it, hah, he's letting me use his credit card, to order it.  He never makes  plans for anything either.  I never really get suprised.  I dunno, I guess it's no big deal, but just once, I'd like to be whisked away on a fun little weekend trip, or be suprised with something totally off the wall.  The bottom line of my gripe is the thought.  I wish he'd put some more thought into doing nice things for me, with me, whatever.  Plan ahead a bit, suprise me.  All that.  I'm expecting none of that, so, I'm a bit dissapointed.  Mixed feelings about my dad not visiting.  We see each other so seldom, and we're pretty close, so any chance I get to see the guy is wondeful. But, in a way, it's a relief, what with all the shit going down with the house.  Having him stay with us would be a serious burden, both financially and time-wise.   We do the tourist thing, and go bunches of places when he's here, and go out to eat every night, all that.  It gets pricy, and we're just shit broke, heh.  Not that I'm complaining, because I love my daddy, and I really look forward to seeing him.  I'm actually bummed that he's not coming.  Bummed and slightly relieved.  So, it's almost May, and I'm getting a little depressed, I feel dissapointment setting in, and I'm jittery with anticipation, all at once.

      I decided to start listing a few things that make me smile.  It's a good thing.  Stuff I should keep in mind.  I'll make them a happy color, so they stand out, even.   My garden.  Opening the back door, and seeing the riot of spring color.  Forsythia bushes, flowering almond, hyacinth, daffodils, a thousand colors of tulips.  I love being greeted by that, every day.    Finishing a good book.  That sense of completion, and mild exhilaration that stems from reading a great new book.  The bond that I have with my son, when every thing's right, and I'm not being a grownup, and he's not being a kid, we're just being two people that are close.  He can be my best friend sometimes.  He's so perfect.

       Lying to the world, lying on a tanning bed.   It's like, an unspoken lie.  Fooling the world into thinking you're the outdoorsy type.  I'm talking about tanning.  Paying obscene amounts of money to lay on hot glass and bake your skin.   Why?  To make it look like you spend time in a warm climate?  To make it look like you spend time being outside?  What's the draw, I don't get it.  People should earn their tans.  I'm not adverse to taking on a little color, in the summer.  Going to renfairs every weekend in August, my chest gets nice and crispy (call it bodice burn) and it looks good.  My face and arms get it from camping.  It's cool.  If my legs get color, even better, but that's sooooo rare, because one would actually have to lie down outdoors, and expose the legs to the sun.  But pay for it!? To schedule time for it?!  To me, it's even more ridiculous than smoking.  Let me shell out vast quantities money, so I have the privilege of destroying my body.    This rant brought to you by Harriet, whose neck looks like a wet paper bag, now.   Whose face is a dangerous shade of brick red.  Whose skin (at 31) is a network of fine lines and flakes.  Who goes tanning every single day "because my legs just aren't dark enough"  And I agree.  Compared to her face, her legs are pretty pale.  Keep shooting for that goal of the perfect tan, baby, everyone knows it's all about you ;)    I'll stick with my SPF 15.

       Stream of Conciousness    I'm in the mood to write.  I'm bored, and my mind is moving a thousand miles an hour.  I have this urge to write, but the thing is, I don't know what to write about.  I just sat here staring at this box for a spell, trying to come up with something profound.  Nothing.  I decided to just start typing, and go stream of conciousness style.    Right now, the most foremost thing is the Blogger logo is pissing me off.  So orange and smug, up there in the corner.  A little up from that is my cat, she's going bald along her sides.  I don't know why, no fleas, she's healthy as a horse.  My mom claims it's radiation because the cat spends 20 hours a day on my moniter.  Poor kitty.  Now there's a car alarm going off at the bar.  I hate living across the street from a bar.  It's a seedy one, too.  I mean, it looks pretty on the outside, but the clientele SUCKS.  Union Beach is about as hilbilly as you can get, and still be on the Jersey Shore.  That bar is like, hillbilly concentrate.  Fights every weekend, people having full blown domestic disputes right in the parking lot (and often it carries over into our front yard).  Karaoke every Thursday.  This would be the perfect neighborhood, if it weren't for the bar.    It's amusing.  I see a lot of the same people drunk, staggering, screaming at each other, making a scene across the street, as I do on weekday afternoons, in the "kindergarten mom" crowd.  Even more amusing, a lot of these women are the ones that were nasty uppity bitches in elementry school.  The teasers, the in crowd, the beautiful girls.  I see them now, and I feel good.   They have bad skin, and cheap clothes.  They have dark roots and peroxide blond highlights.    I endured seemingly infinite amounts of torture and ostrasizing when I was a kid.  I'm a strong and sensitive person now, because of it.  They doled out the torture and look.  They're what?  Sloppy drunk white trash welfare messes?  Karma, it's so nice.  Do I sound bitter?  I'm not, really.  Maybe a little, but it's not a defining thing in my life.  I'm no swan, but, it feels a little good to see them walking places when I can drive.  To see them working in fast food resturaunts.  I wonder what their 12 year old selves would say to them now.  I bet it wouldn't be pretty

       Leveling Judgement   I was gonna post something about being judgmental, I had it all composed in my head.  It leaked out.  Shoot, it was good too.  Oh, oh, it's coming back to me.  Last fall, when I started becoming closer friends with Harriet, she wanted to "confide" in me (that's in quotes, because I learned later that she "confides" in everyone that will listen...That's a future entry, though) about something that was troubling her.  She asked if I was the morally judgmental type, if I'd think differently of her if she told me something.  I truthfully said "No".  Now, I'm sort of at a loss, because after all is said and done, it's really not no.    The original confession is that she cheated on her husband with this guy.  She "loves this guy so much, he's so perfect, the chemistry is amazing, he completes me"  [face_vomit] By cheated, I mean carry on a 9 month relationship with the guy, spending every spare second with him, going as far as leaving her kids with her sister for a week, to spend the whole time with him.    That pretty much makes me nuts.  It's sick and dishonest.  But, whatever, love is love, how can I hate her?  Sometimes what you do when you're 21 (getting married) isn't where you want to be when you're 31.  Whatever.  I counseled her through her woes, listening nightly to drama on the phone.  There's a lot more to it than just this, lots of sordid little details.  She managed to break it off with the guy, or he broke it off with her, or something, and she "reformed".    That's magnificent.  Error of her ways and all that.  I was honestly happy for her, because she went on and on about putting more energy in her family and kids, blahblahblah.    So, normally I see her every day, when we pick the kids up, right?  I haven't seen her pretty much since the beginning of April.  We talked on the phone a few times, and she's always busy, I'm always busy, but more importantly she's never around to pick up her daughter anymore.  Other family members are doing it.   I found out why.  She told me all covertly today, that she's back "with" this guy (who is also married, with a daughter, and -get this- doesn't speak a word of English, haha, no, he's Puerto Rican.  She doesn't speak Spanish either, so how he 'completes' her I'll never know.  How they're 'with' each other also baffles me, being married to separate people, and all. Could have something to do with penis size...But I digress)  Now, after all this compassion, and holding her hand, so to speak, through a difficult winter of her trying to get her family life together, and get back on track. This guy calls her up once, and invites her over, and she's off sucking his dick again.    Now, she pretty much repulses me (oh, there were many things leading up to that, this is the straw, though).  How can I go on smiling, being friendly, when I think she's the scum of the earth?    I guess I am judgmental.    This little rant just helped me firm up what I'm going to say to her, when she starts the bullshit "confiding" again.  I can't support that kind of behavior.  I mean, once is a mistake, twice is stupid, and three times?  That's just fucking self destructive.  I won't be a party to it.  Let her talk to the gas station attendant, or any of her ass kissy buddies.

       The Big Purchase and Roy vs. Joe   I just spent 3,500.00    There is something incredibly satisfying about walking into a store, doing a little paperwork, paying in cash, and walking out the proud owner of 3,500.00 worth of new cabinets.  I ordered them, they'll be here at the end of May.  I'm so excited I can barely contain myself.  This means I have a firm deadline now.  End of May.  The cabinets will be the last piece in the puzzle.  Now I gotta get the rest of the pieces together (flooring, finish painting, and *cue doom music* PACKING).    I also spoke again to Roy, the guy who wants to rent.  The more I talk to him the more I like him.  He's a nice, nice guy, totally upstanding.  Told me a little about himself, and his girlfriend.  I really like his kind of people, he's a Methodist, goes to the same church that I used to (back when I did the church thing) knows a lot of the same people I know.  He's totally into clean living, no drinking, no smoking, blahblah.  His girlfriend works at a local Dunkin Donuts and is putting herself through college.  I have such good feelings about these people.  No pets.  Two kids that would visit on alternate weekends, but otherwise, no kids.  People I can respect, people I would be thrilled to rent to.  Joe, my contractor.  The other guy that wants in this house...he's...well...he'd pay me the same amount of rent, and I trust hhim for my money, but the guy is a slob.  He's also eyeing the house because it's across the street from his favorite bar.  He's a nice guy, yes, but his quality of living...it leaves much to be desired.    I know Roy will love my house like I do, he'll appreciate it.  Right now the guy is living in a one bedroom apt with his brother.  He's sleeping in the dining room, poor guy.  This house is small, but it's head and shoulders above a dining room.  He's a neat freak, and he loves gardening.  I know he'll love my little flowerbeds as much as I did.  Joe?  He'd probably park one of his trucks on them.  I'm renting based on character, and quality of life.

       The Fullness of Trust   Trust is a wonderful thing.  When perfect trust is attained, all sorts of greatness blossoms in it's wake.  Words and thoughts flow so smoothly, when you're not worrying if someone's gonna turn on you.  Honesty is the best policy, always remember that, and I think life becomes that much easier.    It's not easy to always be honest, that's not what I mean.  Sometimes that's really hard, but the results of it are more than rewarding.  Total honesty completes me, when it's freely given and taken.

      We started painting today, got the whole bedroom and closets done with primer.  It's so satisfying.  It was pretty cool, we had the boy up there helping, he worked for a solid two hours, and he wasn't doing half bad.  We had him doing the insides of closets.  He was pretending he was on Monster House, haha.     The mister is such a goob.  We're standing in Walmart, I'm holding a selection of rollers.  I say "We need trays, we only have one"  (we're doing  a whole house, keep in mind, eight rooms and about 40 closets)  He says, "No, I have dozens in the shed, no no, don't buy any more"  He didn't.  We have one.  :|  I'll be making a trip to Lowes tomorrow.  For more trays, rollers, and supplies that he assumed we had hundreds of.  This is why I run the household, and he works.

      I thought this was interesting.  My mom was bitching at me, because I complained about the saleschick at the clothing store yesterday.  "Well, look at you, you look like a homeless teenager"  What my mom fails to understand is that a homeless teenager couldn't AFFORD to look this way.  Good jeans are expensive.  I get mine on clearence, usually, so we're looking at between 10-30 bucks.  The Best Pants Ever, my wonderful cargoes I bought at retail, for a whopping sixty bucks.  A regular tee shirt, plain black pocket tee, is about 5 bucks.  I wear them often enough, but, my "good" everyday shirts are a little costlier.  Concert shirts run between 20 and 40 bucks, a nice printed tee, like my dragons one, or this cool tiedye Celtic knotty one are about 25 a pop.  Hooded sweatshirts?  Between $20 and $60.  Overshirts, longsleeve tee shirts, all those can get pricy too.    And what about accesories? Expensive shoes.  Sketchers, Converse, Birks, Doc Martens.  All $$.  Expensive leather backpack-purse.  Then lets talk jewlery.  I wear white gold, looks like silver.  I have a handful of pieces, a few diamond rings, some chunky linky bracelets, with some silver mixed in.  Piercings, stainless, and roughly $50-$80 bucks a pop (11 pops and counting).    Now for the vanity stuff (and I'm high maintenence, lemme tellya) Sculpted nails, $40 bucks a month, pedicures $25 a month, tattooes...very expensive.  Quality makeup, dyed hair, etc etc.  And that's just normal casual stuff.  I should print this out and show my mom.

      I know, I know, it's been awhile.  Honestly, life hasn't been all that interesting.  No one's ticking me off enough to vent about it, no real turbulence, to speak of.    I'm gonna do my magical kickstart.  Three things I did today (yeah, eventful as hell, it's not even noon yet, and I've already got a nice list going)  Thing 1:  Got woken up by my dad calling to wish me a happy Mother's Day   Thing 2:  Took my Blazer to get the muffler fixed (bout goddamn time) it was so loud, it was giving me a headache to drive it.  Finally scrounged up the fundage to have it repaired.  Thing 3:  Ok, this is lame, but I'm so proud of myself.  My favorite pants were developing a nice hole.  Right along the edge of the pocket, down the leg.  I've been being careful, and trying not to further the hole, as these really are my favorite pants.  Big baggy green cargo pants. Sooo comfy.  Yesterday, I went to the store to find a suitable replacement, or some crops, or something.  The salesgirl was apathetic at best, and clearly didn't want to help me, I could tell.  She gave me the almighty once-over, and moved on to wealthier looking targets.  Fuck her, though, I had a bag of cash that I was looking to dump into their register, in exchange for a few pairs of decent pants.  I just *look* like a bum.  It's funny, I'm digressing, but I gotta say, it costs a lot of money to look like a bum...  I'll make that a seperate entry, I think.  I'll leave it at this:  It's expensive to look this way, and still be neat and clean.  Sooooanyway, I left there sans pants.  This morning, I go to put them on, and the once minisule hole is spreading.  It's all the way up to the waistband, and halfway into the pocket.  Rather than stop wearing The Best Pants Ever, I took some initiative, and decided to sew it.  Now, I used to sew everything, I'm pretty good at it.  When you buy cheap clothes, you just learn to sew, and make do. I once pieced a bra back together.  It's been about 4 years since I've had to.  I'm easier on my clothes, I guess, and I buy better stuff these days.  So, I grabbed me some thread and set to work.  I sewed that hole so well, from the inside, you can scarcely tell where the original stitching stops and mine starts. I sewed a Y in it, to reinforce the pocket, and doubled over my work.  All handstitching (sewing machines scare me, long story).  I walked around this morning with my huge keyring in that pocket, and it's holding up nicely.  I'm so domestic :D I made myself proud.

      This is one of the things that sucks about my job.  We cut the grass for a lot of really old people, see. Generally, it's pretty smooth, kids step in and start handling finances, when they die or go to nursing homes.  Houses get sold, whatever.  It's fine, mostly.  Once in awhile, we get some poor old lady who's slowly going senile, and gradually becomes sort of a lunatic.  I'm dealing with that now.  She's been a customer for 10+ years, we haven't raised her prices, she's been on a pretty regular schedule, and my husband cuts her all sorts of breaks.  Well, now the new season is upon us.  Daily, I've been getting angry phone calls from her, because he didn't do a good job on a cleanup (that he did in September) because there are leaves in the yard.  I wanted to schedule her for a spring cleanup, and she freaked out, saying he has to go there and do it again, because she payed 85 bucks, by god.  (Generally, there's a fall cleanup, AND a spring one, some people opt for only one).  The regular price for a job her size would be $125, but since she's old...we cut her a deal.  I told her all that.  She's angry.  She's German.  She's going crazy.  Every single day.  She calls.  For maybe  two weeks, now.   "Get these leaves out of my yard, I pay you good money!"   She's pissed.  I don't even pick up the phone anymore.  I see her name on the caller ID, I dodge.  I called her in early March, to see if she still wanted her grass cut, and she said yes, so that's cool.  It started growing, and now she's two cuttings in the hole, refuses to pay, he's not going there any more to cut it, because she's not paying, and now this bullshit about the stupid leaves.  Hasn't paid us a nickel since that $85 in September.  I know the woman, she's always been sort of a pain in the ass, but a good customer, and a paying one, which is nice.  We're ready to cut her loose, but we know she's got no one really, to take care of her, and find another landscaper.  Plus, in this day and age, she's gonna get hit up for a lot more than 20 bucks a cutting.  We can't keep taking hits like this though.    Such a dilemma.  It genuinely sucks.

      I'm discovering the true meaning of that word, today.  I'm doing what Afe's doing, listening to my whole entire mp3 library.  I've got a reason, though.  I'm getting an iPod soon, and I don't want any songs I hate, or broken songs, or anything like that on there.  I'm looking at upwards of 1300 songs.  Roughly 75 hours of music.  So far, I'm on #36.  Just chippin away slowly, haha.  It's cool, though, because already I've heard a fair range of styles, and only had to delete some Christmas music.  A good Christmas carol will throw off any random mix...    It's good, though, to hear Maddy Prior near Fear Factory.  Sisters of Mercy, Slayer, and Cab Calloway.  Voltaire and Toby Keith and UB40.  Vivaldi, Pearl Jam, Shabba Ranks, and Bad Religion.  The Cars and Amorphis.  I love the combos, haha.  It's my own crazy radio station.

      Tom.  He was my best friend, when I was younger  He thought he was gay, and that was cool.  He decided that he wasn't, and we became a couple.  He was my first real love.  We got engaged when I was 18, planning to get married when we got out of college and all that.  I really did love him.  I suppose I still do, in a way.    Then, it seemed like overnight, everything came crashing down, he decided he was still gay, and left me.  He disappeared for 2 years.  Came back, and I was married and pregnant.  We became best friends, again, like we never were apart.  The relationship part of our friendship was a mistake, we came to the conclusion, and it freed us up to be great friends.  Uh.  I'm skimming over some details, because I don't want to really write about it now. I might in time, but not now.  He killed himself on April 30, 2001.  It was a Thursday around 11 a.m., they say.  I found out on that Sunday May 3, when a mutual friend called.  7 a.m.  To this day, when the phone rings early on Sundays, I get a little shudder.  I'd have found out earlier, but I ignored his roommate, calling me.  Jeff.  Jeff called about 4 times between Friday night and Sunday, but I didn't pick up, because Jeff always wanted something, a ride, money, help, to borrow something.  Jeff was poison.  I'm crying a little now, and rambling.  Yeah.  Went to the funeral on that Tuesday.  The same day as two final exams, for that semester in college.  I flunked.  I didn't really want to go into this.  I wanted to just say Tom, my old best friend.

I hate that, I think I had it captured perfectly, and now, nothing I type will match it, and it's not even showing up.  It's my turn to have a tantrum, and look for a new commenting system.

      I also got new shoes yesterday (no, that's not the confession).  I needed new "nice" flipflops, since I got paint all over my old ones, and they were old anyway.  I needed new sneakers because for some reason, the mister garbaged my last pair.  They were on the front porch, in this rubbermaid box, with various other shoes, and he got a cleaning bug one day, and just chucked most of them.  My shoes.  He threw away.  Including my only pair of sneakers.  Shoes that I wore.  Yes.  He's psycho like that.  Soanyway, I went in search of a nice pair of all black Chuck  Taylors.  You know the kind, with black rubber, instead of the classic white, and black canvas, black laces.  They didn't have thoooose in my size, but they DID have a nice pair of (omg, I am gonna take such shit for this, I know it) black and pink ones.  Black shoes, pink tounge, white laces, white rubber, and a pink pinstripe.  Soft pink, not hot pink.  They're very cool.    I'm coming to terms with pink.  We're getting along well, now I think.  When I was a kid, I was one of those "pink kids" my bedroom, my clothes, you get the idea.  Then when I was about 12, I rebelled, discovered metal, had a Halloween party with my Barbies, tearing their heads off and soaking them in fake blood.  I've been pretty much anti-pink since, but I sense it starting to creep back in around the edges.  Jelly bracelets.  Sneaker trim.  Dog collar.  I'm ok with it.  The first time I buy a pink dish, or pink carpet, or pink clothes, please someone shoot me.  I still hate it mostly.

      For all the ranting I did the other day, about Dan (of Dan & Mindy) we hung out last night, and he wasn't so bad.  They popped by.  They always pop by at the most inopportune times.  The mister was out in the yard putting in an assortment of little bushes and trees I picked out (since my flowers are mostly gone) and I was painting.  I was wearing these little shorts with holes in them, and a raggedy holey paint stained tee shirt, no bra, no shoes, I had paint on my legs, in my hair, on my face.  I stunk, because it was like 90 in the house, and I was singing (LOUDLY) along to my L7 CD.  The door swings open, but I ignore it, thinking it's the old man.   They walk clear in the house, right up to where I was painting in the living room.  Scared the shit out of me.    Embarassing, a little, I don't think I could have looked worse if I tried.  I really shouldn't be embarassed, I guess.  We've all been friends for so long.  We've woken up from being passed out on the same couch, with puke stiffening on our shirts, and in our hair.  We've all gone camping together, and no one looks great camping, haha.  I don't know, it still threw me.  Maybe because I haven't seen them since Novemberish.  I ran and took a shower, and we all went out for dinner.    Dan's recently become this gym nut, weightlifter guy.  I mean, I guess since he's he's a rock staah, he's gotta work out for his fans.  But, he eats "healthy" now, too.  He also evaluates what everyone else eats.  Now I remember why I don't exactly like going places with the guy.  I got meatloaf and mashed potatoes, and broccoli (all smushy food, because of the labret) and the plate arrives, and he's like "whoa, there's a lot of gravy on that meatloaf" Mindy gets a club sammich and fries, and he mentions offhand "you're not gonna eat ALL those fries, are you?"  (I would honestly strangle him if I had to cope with that on a day-to-day, I don't know how she does it).  *shrug*  This from the guy that used an entire bottle of ketchup on his steak.  I have to chuckle.  He's kind of a jerk.  Other than that, he's still Same Old Dan, which is cool.  I rant about the guy, but I love him like a brother, like, I say he's a jerk, but I take it with all the good.  He's got a lot of good.  Mindy too, she's my partner in mischief.  Great people all around. I just wish they would call before coming over sometimes...  The mister suprised me with an early bag of presents yesterday :D  The new Fear Factory CD, Archetype, the new Anthrax best of CD/DVD, and this sweet sweet new toy.  I collect action figures (like the dorkiest degree of dork) and he got me this Special Edition McFarlane's Movie Maniacs version of the Lord of Darkness (from the movie, Legend, remember the big red guy?)  One of my ALL TIME FAVORITE BADGUYS EVER.  The figure is just mindblowing.  It's huge too.  So detailed.  McFarlane ruuuules.  It was just a sweet little "Here, I was thinking about you this morning" sort of thing.  Made me feel good.  So, this month isn't shaping up to be as bad as I thought it would.  Today is the 3rd anniversary of the day I found out Tom died.  Last year I was in a funk over it, the year before I was barely functional.  I guess time does heal, because this year, I thought about it, I feel a little somber, but it's not as sharp anymore.  Not as painful.  I'm doing ok, all in all.  Life is going on as normal, and the only time I get really depressed is at night, before I go to sleep, when my mind stops buzzing, and I can't help but think about the sadder things.  Ok, writing about it (even indirectly) is starting to make me a little teary.  Nuff of that.

      I wish it wasn't the wee hours of the morning, on Guam, right now.  I'd call my dad.   urlLink This  made me cry.    My father was a corpsman, he served in Viet Nam.  He retired out of the Navy, when he moved to Guam in the 80's.  I would always ask him what his job was like, and he'd tell me all the menial stuff, that he did when he wasn't deployed, like oversee the medical records, at Naval Hospital, or work in the supply room, or whatever.  I never knew what he *really* did.  I never knew why he, a Navy guy, was always stationed on Marine bases.  Once, someone asked me where I lived, when we were in North Carolina, and I said Camp LeJune.  They said "but that's Marines".  I was like *shrug* my dad's Navy, I dunno.  Why he refuses to watch war movies, or hang out in crowds.  Why he won't go to fireworks displays.  Why he got so fucking offended that time I told him I saw a splatter picture of a bus accident victim, and I referred to it offhand as "Vietnam nasty"  From a very early age, he taught me to respect the human body, and learn everything about it.  I knew what acetaminophen was, before I knew what Tylenol was.  Where my maxilla, mandible, tibia, fibula, patella, all that. I remember so much of all the random medical jargon he taught me.  He really REALLY had his heart set on me being a doctor. But, I honestly STILL didn't really know what he did.  I took a class, in college, that focused, in part, on the Vietnam war.  We spoke to a number of Vets, and the would relate stories, funny, grizzly, awe inspiring.  Even, a corpsman came to talk to us, some of his tales were particularly moving.  It didn't exactly sink in that this guy, and my dad, had the same job.    I asked my mom about it once.  She said "Oh, your dad was a big hippie.  He joined the Navy, to get out of the draft, so he could have some cushy job."  I always suspected that she was full of shit (she hates the guy).  Reading that, pretty much confirmed it.  He's always been anti-war, but he's not the person my mom makes him out to be.  I know that already, but this hit home.  I just want to thank Mike for giving me a very good perspective.  I've gained a new, deeper respect for my father, the military, and medical personel in general (moreso than I already had).  That letter, in that link really registered.  Thank you.

      Saw The Harriet this morning, as usual.  She came clip-clopping across the parking lot, on her teeny high heels, with her arms outstretched.  "I'M SORRRRRRY!!! I'm sorry I just looked at a calendar today!  I didn't even KNOW yesterday was the 13th!  Happy Birthday, omg!"  I smiled.  Nooooooo biggie.  But, she's firmed her status, with me.     More news on the JW's:  Betty called again today, but only to say how totally ill she is, and she couldn't possibly make it this coming week.    :D  I am in the best mood, ever.

      She called me about 8 times yesterday.  I saw her in the morning, when we dropped the kids off at school.  I stood there for 15 minutes while she regaled me with her woes, her stresses, how busy she is, how she really needs my help to get these dishes together for this party.     She called me  at 11 a.m. grilling me about this and that, and confiding that she's afraid she can't see her "love" this afternoon, between tanning, and cooking for the party, there's just not enough hours in the day.   (read:  her "love" isn't her husband, but we knew that already).    She called me at 3 on the dot, just as I was picking my son up from school, and discussing with his teacher how much fun they had on the class trip.  She interrupted me.  I joked to the mister later, that the only reason I picked up the phone, was because I thought she'd realized that today was my birthday, and she'd be terribly embarassed, for not having mentioned it.  No.  She answers with this   "Ok, I have a  stuuuuupid  question" (since when aren't they?)  "Stop and Shop doesn't have those little eggplants you were talking about, what do I do!?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"---I  can't---ear---y---bre--ing--up-call----*fake static*--later *click*"  It was hysterical.  My husband thought it odd, as I normally get perfect reception, in the schoolyard...   She calls at 6.  "Did you get those trays I wanted?"   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me, slightly bemused, "Nope." "BUT I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO YOUR MOM'S HOUSE TODAY!?  DID YOU FORGET TO GET MY TRAYS?!?!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I didn't forget" *strained silence*  *muffled exasperated sighs*  "When are you going to get them?!  We need them for Sunday, you know!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eeeyup.  I know.  Listen.  I'm eating dinner.  My cake's about to come, I gotta go"  The cake thing, that was a clue.  It was futile.  I didn't have cake.   10:00 p.m.  She calls me.  I'm already half sloshed.    "How do I slice the bell peppers, for the grilled vegetables?!" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With a knife" "LIIISA c'MON! What the FUCK?" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carefully, with a knife, don't cut your fingers.  I'm drunk, goodbye."   Now, I don't ask for much.  I'm content with checking my personality at the door, when I see her, most of the time.  It's all about her.  Sure.  I'm fine with slaving over food that "she" cooks, and brings to various functions (yes, I do it all the time), only to have her take full credit.  Whatever, a favor is a favor, I'm not after loads of attention for my cooking.  I'm even fine with being bossed around sometimes.  But, forget to say a simple thing like "Happy Birthday" when you see me, on the morning of my birthday?  Call me up, to interrupt an otherwise glorious day (and really it was, seriously the best birthday I've had in 3-4 years) and yell at me?  She went from being one of those "distancy, small doses, I tolerate her because she's my neighbor" type of friends, right to "shit list".

      I must wish GE a Happy Birthday.    He's a scholar, a poet, a thinker, a boat junkie, a genuinely hilarious d00d, a raving nutjob, and an all around decent h00m.  It's nice that we're sorta back in touch, again.  Here's to you on your (what, 54th, 55th?) birthday, the world became that much odder when you entered it.

      Women do.  urlLink Threads like this  GENUINELY piss me off.  Oh poor pity my ugly titties.  They're so not normal.  I want them to look like all those girls on TV, and in Playboy.  This one is a double whammy.  It's a plea for attention, a woman who doesn't know anything but to whine or talk about sexuality, as a way of getting attention.  I've never seen her contribute to any thread, make a valid point, start or continue an interesting discussion.  It's either sex or whining.  It's also a "I hate my body, I want to look more -normal-"    Frankly, I'm ashamed to call myself a girl, if this is what I have to share the gender with.  I wanted to rant more.  I lost steam.  I'll revisit this topic, for sure.  It's a long standing thing.  SP had one, Kit.  ACF seems to be TEEMING with them.  *bangs head on keyboard*

      I can't keep staring at that god awful smiling maw.  I have to write *something* just to push it down a little.  Maybe something that makes me smile.  Maybe a nice quote.  Maybe both.    I love it when my doggies lay across the back of the couch, with their legs draped down, and their heads on the windowsill, catching some rays, or sniffing the breeze.  They're like adorable little couch pillows.  Me and the dogs have the same simple pleasures.  Nap in the sun, a good frolic in the yard, another nap, a good meal... yeah, you get the picture.    "Give me Levity or give me Death!" priest, over on ACF said that.  It's my new ACF battlecry.

      I just purchased my first song.  Guns 'n Roses, November Rain.  Good feeling, buying a song.  It's guaranteed to be the full version, and in good shape.    I've stolen music.  It's more complex, though, than just taking something for free.  I got my whole CD collection stolen from my house, in October.  Someone broke in, and walked out with a laundry bag filled with 400+ CD's.  My life was in that bag, signed stuff, rares, imports, all that.  Plus, some of my all time favorite tunes/bands.  I've downloaded songs, to replace some of what got stolen, I could never replace the whole library, but a few songs I was really in the mood for, I had to get.   I feel justified.  I bought them all, some more than once.  I also download songs  to audition bands, so see if I like their stuff.  I started doing that before iTunes and the like came out with 30 second previews.  I can't judge a band by 30 seconds, anyway.  I figure, if I like three songs off an album of a "new" band (new to me, that is) then they're worth purchasing, and I go right out and buy the CD.  One good song will do it for a band I already like.    But, I think my stealing days are coming to an end.  I haven't really used K+ in over a month.  All the stuff is of lousy quality, half of it doesn't come in properly.  It's not worth the hassle.  I vow, now, to just pay the $0.99, and buy whatever it is, if iTunes has it.  If they don't, then I don't know what I'm gonna do.  Off to see if I can't find a good copy of For All Eternity, by Fight, once and for all.  Great song.  Hard as hell to find.

      I'm going to start posting thought provoking quotes.  Stuff that makes me whip out a highlighter, or "copy/paste"  Stuff I want to remember, and share with my non-readers.  I shall make them a different color, because like "things that make me smile" this will be a constant thing.   "Organized religion, which likes to fancy itself as the mother of compassion, long ago lost its right to that claim by its organized support of organized violence." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Archeologist, Jules Henry

      It's a nice zingy spring day.  Thunderstorms at night, perfect blue sky in the morning.  It's sunny, hazy, sleepy, warm, cool, bracing, and fragrant, all at the same time.    Step one from eliminating Them from my life is in place, and the effect is Good.  Them, heh, I suppose it's a good time to get into who They are.  Two years ago, about, a Jehova's Witness came to my door, looking to offer Bible study.  I took her up on it.  I know a lot of things, about a lot of faiths, but I wanted to learn the Bible better, and I didn't know thing one about the JW's.  When I agreed to it, I thought it would be a one or two time sesson.  Fast forward to 2004, and it's been on again-off-again a two year thing.  Let's get some things straight, here.  I'm not a Jehovah's Witness.  I'm not even Christian.  I learned TONS about their organization, and TONS about the Bible through their perspective.  I never once went to a meeting, or anything like that, and it was cool, no one was pressuring me to.  It was just a weekly Bible study.  Which I take as more of a scholarly research sort of thing.  First, it was Betty.  Betty is a pushy woman, with a piercingly high screechy voice.  She knows a lot, though, and she was fine to study with.  Oh, and she's clinically insane.  She dropped out after a few months, and was hospitalized for depression and a bunch of other stuff.    In steps Kathy, whom I love.  Kathy is a wonderful woman, smart, sweet, quiet, funny, with a real earnest way about her.  She had only been a JW for two years when we met, and her daughter just recently got baptized. When Kathy and (and occasionally her 15 year old daughter) I would study together, it was like us learning together, always challenging each other, and finding things out together.  I genuinely like Kathy, she's like human light.  There's not a thing bad about her, honestly.  We studied for well over a year, and I could have happily gone on like that for more years.  Good person, good family, our weekly things were a nice little break.    She had family turbulence, and lots of things happened, so we had to stop with the study.  I made it clear to Kathy, that it ends with her, no more studying, please.  If she wants to resume where she left off, when life settles back out, that would be cool.  That was a little over a month ago.  Betty came back.  Now, she's on a mission.  Every time she comes over for our scheduled things, she brings someone from the congregation.  I sense that these are really devout types "heavy hitters" if that makes sense.  Like Betty's on this mission, and she's brought out the "big guns"  Every week for the past month or so, I'm getting grilled on my faith (which I have plainly said is different from their own.  If they knew the whole truth...heh, once in awhile I like picturing what Betty would do, if she caught me deep in a trance, or in a full scale purification ritual...but I digress) anyway, getting grilled on my faith, and having their edicts drilled into my head.  It's becoming a pain.  Spiritually, mentally, approacing physically, my head starts to pound just a little before Tuesday  11 a.m.  That's not what I signed up for.  They need to GO.  Betty won't take no for an answer.  You see, I'm rather non-conforntational in real life (amusing, right?) So I can't be like "Listen, bitch, you need to GO.  I'm full on-moon-worshipping-drum-beating-nude-dancing-savage-PAGAN"  Though, it's tempting.  I know she's not wound too tight, and I couldn't hack it if I sent her to the nuthatch.  That sounds like a conceit, but you have to understand, she's devoting a lot of time to me.  Not only do we have the regular weekly study, but now she's taken to dropping by unannounced...that's no good at all...I'm digressing again.  So, ok, I can't just come right out and tell her to beat feet.    I'm being subtle about it.  I still gotta do *something* about it, they're killing me.  They're wasting my time and theirs, and it's not pleasant anymore.  Yesterday, like I said, I meditated on it.  I thought about it all day yesterday.  I started with a simple purification, cleaning the whole house physically, then psychically, getting out all the nutso-evangelical-militant-JW vibes.    I suppose, though, ya put enough thought into something, direct enough energy into it, it just sets itself in motion.  She called me early this morning, to cancel for today, because she's not feeling well.  She normally reschedules something right away, but this time she was being nebulous about it.  Do I think I've gotten rid of the JW's completely?  Hehe, I can hope, right?  No, I think Betty will be back, but when she does come back, I'll be ready for her, and ready to send her packing again.

      Epiphany time:  I was meditating earlier, something I haven't done in a while.  I started out going to read, but I closed the book, and let my mind go.  Turned into a full on meditation session.  Good for me.  I discovered a few things.  Thing one:  My life is in  Iss right now.  I'm tired of being frozen.  I want to move forward again.  Thing two:  I need to take initiative, for that to happen.  How am I gonna do that?  This is how:  1) There are a few people in my life that are unnecessary.  Get rid of them.  They're dragging me down, and holding me back.  Time for a good old fashioned banishing.  2) There are some people in my life that I haven't been devoting enough attention to.  Time to make some phone calls, and make nice.   3) Start producing again. I do well, when I schedule things.  I hereby declare that I will work for a half hour a day on The Book.  That should give me some noteworthy progression.  That includes spending more time researching, and dedicating my life.  It's time to clear the cobwebs. Vacuum the crap off the floor, so to speak. and get going with things.  I'm sure all aspects of my life will improve.  When I get going like this, they generally do.

      Oh, this morning, I was pissy.  I went to bed pissy.  Last night, before falling asleep, the mister thoughtfully asks what I want to do today.  I said "I want to sleep late, and wake up to a nice breakfast, made by you."  He says "*snort* You'd have woken up in the wrong house..."  I went to sleep after that, slightly hurt.  I was serious about that.  I just wanted a nice leisurely morning, nice breakfast, someone else cleaning the kitchen for once.  Just a little pampering.    This morning, he forgot to say anything to me, pretty much did his own thing,  till around noon-ish, when he noticed me being terse.  I sort of went off.  Jesus Christ, is it too much to ask to be THOUGHT ABOUT?!  He was sorry, he said "I thought I wished you a happy Mother's Day, this morning...maybe I only thought I did"  Lame excuse, but, at least he was trying to cover his ass.  I'll take it.  Still, no flowers, no nice thoughts, no nothing, till I sorta flipped out. He felt bad.  I didn't want him to feel bad, I just wanted to be noticed, I guess.   After my mini-tantrum we went out for a nice lunch.  Then he took me to Best Buy, and got me that iPod I've been after, as an early b-day/Mother's day gift.   I love it.  I LOVE IT.  Coolest thing EVER EVER.  I mentioned it once, a few weeks ago, and nothing since.  He remembered (but not enough to suprise me with it...I suppose I shouldn't bitch about that, though).  I honestly wasn't counting on getting it, being that it's rather pricy, and sort of a toy.  So, it's cool.  He's off the hook for being a self-absorbed shlub.  He's a spendy self absorbed shlub, so, things even out, heh.  I've been playing with it since.  I can't keep my hands off the thing, haha, it's so incredibly cool.  I feel like a teenager again, walking around with headphones on all the time, hehe.  The best part, though, it's sooo nice to finally have real music in my cars.  (I bought the car-player adapter jobby, too) I hate the radio.  Alden gave me a nice plant, that my mom and him picked up last week.  Pretty red flowers, heart shaped leave, forgot what it was called...and, some cute things he made in school.  He made a jewelery box, painted purple, heart shaped, with some rhinestones glued on the lid.  He presented it to me, and said "for your extra bars and rings, so you don't lose them"  I love that kid so much.  He never fails to make me laugh, the kid is so untypical.  We stopped by and saw my mommy, took them out for dinner.  Was nice, they complained about the meal, but it comes with the territory.  My stepdad gave her one white rose, heh, I brought over two boquets, and arranged them for her, one of varigated pink roses (lighter pink, tipped with deep pink, very pretty) and one of white carnations.  I arranged them mixed up in two of her vases.  I think Earl feels outdone.  Haha, let him, the jerk.  I also got her this primo pedicure kit.  She loves cosmetics, but won't spend on nice ones for herself, she goes for cheapy stuff, so I pampered her a little.  She's a basket case, my mother, but I love her a lot.  We're close.

      I always say "Rule Number One:  Don't be a dick."  As a joke.  Over the years, it's sort of evolved.  Like, Rule Number Two is "It doesn't matter what you do, it matters how you look while you're doing it"  #3 Don't believe everything you read, see on TV, or what people tell you.  You'd think that's common sense, but, suprising what people take as "truth" based merely upon hearsay.  #4 There is no such thing as "common sense"  It should be called "uncommon sense" because so few people exhibit it.  #5 If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.  #6 Jealousy is a wasted emotion.   There's a few more, but I can't think of them right now.  Just stuff I've come to apply to the everyday.

      This is *really* starting to piss me off.  REALLY.  Money is just dissapering out of our house.  A few nights ago, I emptied my pockets, before bed, and left two 20's, a 10, and a wad of singles, in my normal spot.  Got up the next morning, and there was one 20, the 10, and the singles.  Somehow, in the 6 or so hours I was sleeping, a 20 dollar bill went *poof*.  I originally thought the mister grabbed it on his way out the door, because he found himself short on cash, no biggie, we do that sort of thing all the time.  He didn't.  It just dissapeared.  Tonight, the mister used a $100 to pay for dinner.  He got the change, and pocketed it, as we were walking out of the resturaunt.  Didn't think anything of it, till just now.  He wanted to give me the remainder, over 75 bucks (we ate cheap tonight), for various upcoming expenses.  Went in his pocket, and it was gone.  "Did I give you that change yet?", me, "Noope"  No seriously, we shook this house upside down.  It's NOWHERE.  He's hopped in the car and is heading toward the place, now, to check the parking lot.  We left there around closing, there's a chance it could still be there.  He also, recently had $85 in cash stolen out of his truck.  He generally keeps about $100 of petty cash in this box in his truck.  He was only out of eyeshot of it for about 15 minutes, while on a job.  Interestingly enough, an irate ex employee (who knows exactly what he keeps, and where he keeps it) was spotted in that neighborhood, around that timeframe.  Someone is committing mail fraud, with our other address, the one we're not living at yet.  Since the business always used that addy (and is housed on that property, literally) we've always had business checks sent there.  Well, in the past 2 months, they've been disappearing.  About $300-400 worth.  Customers send them out, and they never arrive.  Reliable, longtime customers.  We've been getting all manner of mail for various people (most of them somehow related to the inlaws...)  Those checks went somewhere.  They haven't been cashed, because I'm guessing the person that has them is too dumb to figure out how.  We're not wealthy people.  This hurts.  A lot.  Add all that up, and we're looking at more than a week's pay.

      My stepsister's house was delivered today :D  It's a long time coming, they've been living in this teensy house for years.  Decided to buy some land, and build  a modular home.  All sorts of problems and two years later (sound familiar?  Yeah, we're "racing" haha, to get into our houses) they delivered it today.  She invited the whole family, it was a cool event.  It was supposed to come at 7, and it got as far as the corner, but the road was so tight, they couldn't swing the trailers, with two modules each.  They had to find a guy with an articulator, and have him back the trailers around the corner.  The old Russian woman on the corner was the real problem, they asked her nicely if they could roll back a section of her chainlink, and move one tiny tree (it wasn't landscaped or anything), and she freaked out and refused.  They offered her $1,000.00 for any potential damages.  She wouldn't hear of it.  So, then they had to find the articulator guy.    Alden and I showed up while they were waiting on the guy.  The whole family showed up to watch, pretty much.  My folks, Tom's (her husband) parents, my stepbrother Lou, who I haven't seen in 8 years, and his girlfriend.  They swung this boom crane, and lifted each quarter-section of the house, and placed it on the foundation, like huuge legos.  It was enormously cool.  There's me, ooogling and ooing and ahhing like a big 5 year old, heh.  Good sized place, too.  It'll be great when it's finally done.  Lou, he's an interesting story, that one.  He hates my mother, his stepmom.  I don't know why, though.  I mean, sure she's a force of nature, and sort of a basket case, but he never had to live with her.  She and Earl (his dad, my stepdad) have bailed his ass out of so much shit, it's amazing.  Their house was being foreclosed, my folks took over the mortgage.  His car was being repoed, my mom paid it off.  He owed 2 grand to a shark...my mom "loaned" it to him (hah, she never saw a penny of that).  She got the money out of him for the car, though, because she had to strongarm half of it from him, and half from his psycho ex wife.  Y'see, he had a little coke problem, she threatened to turn him in, if he didn't come up with at least the 3500 to pay for half the car.  She got the rest by going to his psycho ex wife's family, and shaming it out of her.    Anyhoo, allll water under the bridge.  Last time my mother saw the guy, was 5 years ago, when he came knocking on her door looking for a loan (again) this time for 700.  He said "I'll pay you back tomorrow, I just need this TONIGHT, I'll come back here, and you can have my whole paycheck" .  "Good thing" my mom replied, "because tomorrow your father is going in the hospital for chemo, you can stop in and see him, he'd love to see you"  (Earl has cancer).  She doesn't expect the money back, she never really did.  She just wanted him to stop being a fuckup, and make nice with his dad.  That was the last they saw of him, entirely.  Till today.  He laid low for about 3 years, we thought he'd totally dissappeared.  He started getting back in touch with Debbie, slowly, and they sorta got back close again.  That's cool.  Apparently he's all shaped up now.  Whatever.  No one wanted to see the bum, anyway, we were just sorta glad to hear he didn't turn up in a gutter somewhere.  But, today, we hung out.  He's got a longterm girlfriend, of about 6 years, two INCREDIBLE kids, I mean seriously, nicest kids I've been around.  His daughter Sammy is about a month younger than Alden, and his son is a year old.  Happiest, best mannered kids.  His girl is so cool, she was a preschool teacher, now a stay-at-home mom, has her shit totally together.  I kept thinking, NO WAY this is Lou's girl, haha, what DOES she see in him?  Alden and Sammy played so well together, it was amazing.  She has a lot of the same ideas about parenting that I do.  It's totally refreshing to see someone as into teaching respect and courtesy as I am.  Lou makes a great dad, who woulda thunkit.  Heh.  He's a good guy, though, ran into some problems with drugs, fucked up, hit rock bottom, and now he's got his life on track.  I'm totally happy for him.  We've made amends, between us.  His problem with our folks is his own thing, has nothing to do with me.  He's mostly alright to me,  we were close, there for awhile, before he started the drug shit.  (His psycho ex, however is a whoooole nother story.  The big bitch.  6'2  320 lbs.  Yes.  You think I'm kidding, right?  I'm not.  She used to kick the shit out of me REGULARLY, for no reason, but to show that she could, the big bully bitch, and I don't mean a little roughhousing.  I mean like throwing me into walls.   She was a skank too.  Big smelly bully bitch.)  I don't get, though, the animosity toward my mother.  He should be groveling, and thanking the gods that she bailed him out so many times, I know I would be.  I seriously don't get it.  Debbie and I are close, Debbie and my mom are close.  Lou, he can't stand her (and I think he hated me for awhile, too).  The guy visibly winced when he saw their car coming down the road, and Chris nudged him and said "be pleasant".  I don't think knew I caught that.    The race is still on, heh, her house got delivered today, so she's 2 months away from moving in, approx.  My cabinets are shipping June 1, I'm about a month away from moving in.  We made a pact, the first one in the house gives the losers $50 as a sympathy fee, haha.  Nice little housewarming thing.  Interesting day, all around.  Fun, something totally different.

      The party that I slaved cooking for on Friday, was today.  What a fucking nightmare.  I hate going to parties, for starters.  I love having them, hate going to them.     Here's some tips from a professional caterer:  1)  Know exactly how many people you invited, know for sure how many will show up, and plan accordingly.  Try not to err on the side of "too much" when dealing with food, favors, etc.  Causes waste, and is more work for you.  People won't eat as much as you think they will.  She invited 110, expected 80, roughly 40 showed up.  She had enough everythings for 150 people.  She had a lot of everything left over.  2)  While we're on food, KEEP IT SIMPLE.  Make a few workhorses that everyone likes.  If you know everyone likes chicken, make chicken and a few accompanying sides.  Don't make 3 kinds chicken, beef, lasagna, barbecued ribs, kielbasa and sauerkraut, a six foot sub, cold cut platter, sausage and peppers, meatballs, rice, fried potatoes, roasted potatoes, canned corn (?!), grilled vegetables, ziti, 5 kinds of cold salads, etc etc etc...(you think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not.  I think I even left stuff out) NO ONE WILL EAT ANY OF IT.  It's like a law, or something, the more crap you present to people, the less they'll eat.  And the food...there was an assload of it, but it all SUCKED.  Well, the stuff I made was tasty, but I still wouldn't serve it at a party.  The more shit  you have, the more shit you gotta clean up, and pack away.  It's all very simple.  3)  BUY MORE THAN ONE BAG OF ICE  Leaping Christ, it is 90 degrees out.  The soda was 90 degrees, too.  Furthermore, have some water or something handy, because not all of us even drink that shit.  I'd rather do shots of kerosine than drink warm soda.  4) If you have alcohol, have alcohol.  If you want it to be dry, don't fucking have alcohol.  Don't tell some people to BYOB, then wonder why there's 6 guys, wasted, in the corner, and why they're not sharing their case of beer.  5) Sunday Afternoon parties suck, as a general rule.  What kind of real partying can you do Sunday, at noon.  Hell, I'm recovering from Saturday night's debauchery, at that point.  6) Some people like dancing,  some don't.  DO NOT be pushy about it.  She kept trying to drag me out of my seat, and dance.         A) I don't dance to shit music         B)No public dancing when I'm sober         C)WTF, I still had a mild hangover from the night before, AND my stomach was doing a little dancing of it's own, due to the shit food.  *grumble*  7) Don't think that just because you got there, and the food's out, that you're home free.  Parties need to be planned.  They don't just unfold (especially when 70% of the guests hate each other, and no one talks).  Schedule.  Assign people tasks.  Have a schedule of events, i.e Party starts at noon, food comes out at 12:30, food gets cleared away at 2:30, presents get opened at 3, cake and deserts come out at 3:30 party breaks up by 4.  Simple, right?  and CRUCIAL.  They didn't bring the cake out, till the DJ reminded them.  They didn't have her open presents, they didn't even CUT the cake.  They brought it out, people sang, and she wisked it away to the buffet, and plunked it on the table, only to continue dancing.  People were sitting around, waiting for cake, like "WTF" Some other random guest, not even family, took the initiative, and started slicing it up and passing it out.  8) A 75 year old woman doesn't really need a rented hall, a young hip DJ (I'll give them credit, the DJ was excellent), a buffet like spread, and a FOUR FUCKING HOUR party.  You could tell.  She was tired 45 minutes into it.  Fuck, I was tired 45 minutes into it.  But then, it was my own personal hell...  Examine  your motives, when throwing a bash.  Is it really for the person you're planning it for?  Or is it really for you...  9) Four hours is too long.  Way too long. (unless it's a GREAT party, I've seen some last 10 hours, and be great)  Don't freak out and cry when people dissapear 2 hours into it.  Ugh.  I think I'm done.  This cloud has one silver lining, however.  I looked fucking GREAT.  Yes I did.  I wore a short skirt for the first time in about 7 years, and high (HIGH) spike heels.  Black pinstripey gangster lookin skirt, black wraparound style top, and these sandals that were one black strip of leather across the top, with a chain over it and a dog-style chain around the ankle.  They were so hawt, I kept looking down at my feet, thinking "damn, are those my feet? Those are some hawt feet right there!" Felt good.  I'm going to bare some leg more often, I think.  Start wearing some sexy shoes, sometimes.   The other silver lining, is that this one was SOOO bad, now I'm in the mood for a good one, and the wheels are turning.  I see another Legendary Barbecue in my not too distant future.  (I have to pat my back here, my parties are legendary.  I'm talking hot tubs, peeing in the neighbor's convertable, midget porn, cops being called, legendary)  This time I WILL invite the neighbors.

      Rule #8  Just because it fits, doesn't mean it looks good.  Doesn't mean you should wear it.  Lotsa chunkies in tube tops, this weekend.  Heavy people don't offend me in the slightest.  Tube tops, however, should all be rounded up, then rocketed into the center of the sun.

      I've been naughty bad neglectful.  Not just to this blog, but to my online everythings.  I'm alternating busy/apathetic.  When I'm not racing around trying to tie up loose ends, cleaning, packing, painting trim (omfg, there's MILES of trim in my house, I wouldn't have believed it if someone told me.  Miles and miles of contrasting colored trim, painted with a half inch brush.  Definition of tedium, right there), I'm sleeping or playing Morrowind.  I've thought of countless things to write, but couldn't make myself sit and write.  I'll be better about it, I promise.  I'd type more right now, but I'm feelin sorta woozy.

      Today is the one year anniversary of us becoming the official owners of these houses.  June 11 of 2003, was the closing date.  It was when the bank gave our lawyer a check for $75,000.00, and he in turn gave Sr. and Bonnie a check for 33,000.  That was an incredible day.    The reason they only got 33 out of 75 grand, is because the bitch stepmother, Bonnie, decided at last minute, to put her name on the deed of the house.  All the leins and judgements against her, from unpaid doctor bills, bailing her idiot children out of prison (one of which who set the house on fire shortly thereafter, but that's another entry), etc etc, were transferred along with her name, on to the property.  She fucked herself out of the full 75k, which was their asking price.  42 thousand, in leins.  How DOES one manage to rack up that much debt?  I don't know, and I don't care.  It wasn't my problem.  Karma, baby.    That was then.  We immediately went to speak to Joe (yes, the same one from The Brawl) and he gave us a great estimate.  The Tuesday following, we applied for the permits to start rehabilitating the burned house.  That was when Joe got into a fistfight, Jerry Springer style, with the head of the town's building department.  Do I need to mention, that it took almost 4 months, exactly to get our permits?  Yeah.   I know, I know what you're thinking.  A smart person would have fired him then, right?  He was fighting for me, he wanted to make sure the inspector (who, arguably, is a sticky dick wrinkle, and crooked as a question mark) wasn't trying to fuck us.  Well, after the fight, the inspector came over to our house, personally, to apologize to me.  He was rather nice, considering he got assaulted by Joe.    Look how far we've come.  Just look.  :|

      I'm going to link these two things here, for posterity.  I was originally going to post them here, only, but I decided I need a more public forum for my rant.     urlLink The Backstory     urlLink The Brawl   I could say more, but I don't want to get myself all fired up again.  I just want to say, I was utterly stunned, that in a civilized society, a person can take a swing at a customer, and a woman, and not think anything of it.

      I'm not sure why, but I'm anticipating the new server opening up, in AC.  AC has been boring, a minor distraction, at best, for a year now.  Maybe because it's something different.  Maybe because we all have the same chance, starting out new.  Maybe because I'm hoping that people I know will start there, and I'll *finally* have someone to game with.  I don't do well in mmo's on my own.  If I don't have a steady gaming partner, or group, then I'm adrift.  It hasn't been right since the old AC crew, that dissolved in Fall of '02.  Morrowind is good, still, but I powergamed through it, finished the main quest, and now have no desire to repeat all that on this new machine.  I want to reinstall NWN, and FINALLY pick back up on my mod. That thing has been is mothballs so long, I hope I remember where I was going with it.  I just can't find all the CD's :|  If AC doesn't succeed this time around, with the new server, I'm quitting (again, yes, 3 times) and looking for a new MMO, either CoH, or SWG.  I need something social, I think.

      First entry from the new computer.  I love this machine.  Its only flaw is that there are somehow graphics card compatability problems.  Once in awhile it freezes and the screen goes black.  Very strange, very irritating, but I'm working on fixing it.  19" moniter, though, it's incredible, with 18" viewable.  I have to sit 3 feet back from my desk, it's like being at the movies.  The 5.1 surround sound is nice, too.  I haven't had speakers for a year.  It's like being deaf, and hearing for the first time, haha.  It just looks cool, too.  All sleek and black.  It's lit from the inside with green, red and blue lights, and it has this thing called "The Guardian" on the front, which is a blue light, reminiscent of Kit's red light, from Knight Rider (yeah yeah, I know I'm showing my age)  It even pulses and sweeps.  I'm smitten.  I'm in deep smit.  It's a royal pain, however, trying to fix it all the way I like it.  Downloading all the little programs that make my life happy.  Establishing all my favorites, reinstalling all my games, etc etc.  It's a pain in the ass, but a labor of love, I suppose.

      I need something to jump start, here.  Instead of my typical 3 things I did today, I'll talk about the progress since I last really blogged.  On May 26, the house was half painted, no flooring was in place.  Today, the kitchen floor is laid, as well as the hallway, bathroom, and laundry room.  All vinyl sheet flooring.  Every single wall is painted, as well as most of the trim.  There was so goddamned much trim.  If I never have to paint another 3 inch molding, it'll be too soon.  I'm still not done with that, either.  I have one whole bedroom to do.  My son's room is complete, carpet and all.  He inherited a new bed, too, one of those kickass car beds, so we set that all up for him, in there.    Yesterday, we had a lucky streak.  We always check out the clearance sections of Lowes and Home Depot, that's how I got my kitchen sink, half of the light fixtures, plumbing stuff, etc etc.  We're in the market for a 5 foot bathroom vanity, but they're pricy, so we were gonna get a cheapy pedestal sink, or one of those tiny $70.00 jobbers, till we can afford a big one.  There were two TWO (!!) 5 foot vanities!  Wee!  One was sold already (damn, because it was really pretty, white the exact color I wanted)  But this other one...no price on it, the box was beat to shit, but it looked pretty good.  We asked the guy, he came over to inspect it for damage.  There really wasn't any, that we saw, and he said, "hmm, I'll knock a hundred bucks off, it'll cost $278".  Good price, these things normally ran  $400+, but we just didn't have that kind of money, to spend.  We hemmed and hawed.  As we were standing there examining the thing, we pulled it out from the wall.  The bottom of the box was all crushed and torn.  There was a good sized hole in the bottom of the side panel.  About the size of a softball, almost perfectly round hole.  Heh, looked like someone booted it.  We were like "Oh no, look at that, a giant hole.  Nope, not gonna take it"  As we were walking away, the guy was like "huh, that sucks.  This thing is destroyed.  I can sell it to ya for, hmm...85 bucks"  Sold :D.  That, and the flooring we were there to buy, for our kitchen, in stock stuff, had gone on clearance, as well, since I picked it out.  It wound up being about half the original price.  What a great shopping day!  Everything's coming together so well.  The cabinets arrived today, I unwrapped a few, my God, they're perfect.  It's coming up fast.  Two years of working and waiting, agonizing, worrying, spending, paying out, arguing with inspectors, yelling at various workers, and we're coming down to the close of it.  I can honestly say we're on the "finishing touches"  It feels good, so good.  It's all the more rewarding because we worked so hard, wanted it so bad.    It'll pay off so well, once we get this house rented.  A brand new house to move into, and a smaller one, to rent out, and use as a "money battery"  Man, if you had asked me three years ago, if I saw myself becoming a landlord, and owning multiple pieces of property, I would have laughed.    I feel blessed, and lucky.  When this all started, I was bitter, and unhappy about it, it still bothers me.  I can't bitch though, we came out of this so much the winners, it's stupid to be hung up on what's really just water under the bridge.

      Something very interesting about myself, last night.&nbsp; Me+webcam+booze+the right crowd...I can barely keep my clothes on.&nbsp; Throw a felt tipped pen into the mix, and we've invented a whole new style of Drunken Debauchery. &nbsp; Apparently certain parts of my anatomy, remind someone of girlscout cookies.&nbsp; I'm not sure whether to be flattered, or worried. &nbsp; So, I was on cam all night last night, and miraculously, it did not steal my soul, nor did it steal my dignity (the key is, it's all about having the right crowd) BUT I'm still not gonna get one, for home.&nbsp; It would be a matter of time before complete nudity ensued, and that wouldn't be good for anyone.

      Three things I did today:&nbsp; (you're gonna laugh)  &nbsp;  I stayed in bed till 11.&nbsp; I got up at 9, but, instead of leaping out of bed, I rolled over and grabbed my new book,  urlLink Stiff , by Mary Roach.&nbsp; If you have a modicum of morbid curiosity, I highly recommend it.&nbsp; I bought it yesterday, and I'm almost done with it, lively read, impossible to put down.  &nbsp;  I took stock of the liquor cabinet.&nbsp; My mom is out of town, leaving her enormous house, pool, hot tub, very long sofa, big screen TV, and stolen cable, alllll alone.&nbsp; SOMEONE HAS TO KEEP ALL THAT STUFF COMPANY!!!&nbsp; We fully intend to.&nbsp; We're bringing booze, too.&nbsp; Now for the agonizing decision of the day.&nbsp; Mai Tais, or Jamaican Blue...  &nbsp;  I've been neglectful to my householdly duties this week, so&nbsp;I'm spending today in penitence.&nbsp; I mopped the bathroom floor, did the dishes, cleaned the skunky water out from around the dish drain, scrubbed the toilet, etc.&nbsp; All the nasty icky jobs that'll get my efforts noticed.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I haven't been around in over a month, and people are still commenting.&nbsp; I wub joo guys. &nbsp; Some stream of conciousness stuff... &nbsp; I'm happy with myself, untill I see unflattering pictures.&nbsp; Then it does two things.&nbsp; Shatters my fragile self esteem, and motivates me to work out even more.&nbsp; All of a sudden, the lazy pilates,&nbsp;swimming the occasional lap, meandering walks,&nbsp;and meager dumbells I've been halfheartedly doing doesn't seem so effective.&nbsp; I just ordered two workout videos, power yoga, and fatburning pilates.&nbsp; I just wish I could work off the face fat.&nbsp; Tight body.&nbsp; Fat fucking face.&nbsp; Ah well, all I can do about that is continue eating right, and hope it starts melting off.&nbsp; Though, I have noticed in recent pictures, I have got some seriously nice legs.&nbsp; I must wear shorts and short skirts more often.&nbsp; Bag over my head, and a miniskirt.&nbsp; Accentuate the positive, etc. &nbsp; More:&nbsp; My son has thousands of dollars worth of toys, in his room.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; When the TV's off limits (which it is, a good part of each day) he resorts to making mud outside, and playing in that, legos,&nbsp;playing with his shitty dollar store army guys (you know what kind, the teeny green plastic jobbers, that come in bags of 28474272037, and hurt like a bitch to step on), and markers and paper, or some combination of the above.&nbsp; Or books.&nbsp; He's *just* reading, so he'll grab a book off his shelf, and randomly identify words, till he can piece the story together.&nbsp; It's funny, and sad at the same time.&nbsp; Sad, because looking back, "Santa" didn't need to bust the bank, to bring him the 1400 miles of Hot Wheels tracks, and all the accoutrements.&nbsp; Santa didn't have to buy him Leap Pad, Imagination Desk, this electronic thing, that electronic thing.&nbsp; It makes me proud.&nbsp; It makes me poor.&nbsp; I feel dumb.

      Anything that boasts that it can do 15 things, doesn't do any one of them properly.&nbsp; That's a fact.&nbsp; If you're tempted to get an all-in-one printer/scanner/fax, be prepared to have them all either perform those tasks with utmost mediocrity, or, not perform all those tasks, or, just bitch up regularly, and be&nbsp;a pain in the ass.&nbsp; This goes for everything.&nbsp; Kitchen gadgets, car junk, electronics.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp;   It SLICES!! IT DICES!! IT JULIANNES!! Well, no, not really.&nbsp; It slices, sorta, but if you move it like this, it falls apart.&nbsp; It dices, but only after it slices, and only if it doesn't fall apart.&nbsp; And who the fuck is Julianne?

      I wish I could find a place that would deliver a nice&nbsp;ham and cheese sandwich, and maybe a cup of split pea soup.&nbsp; I'm mildly hung over, hungry, not in the mood to cook anything, not dressed, and with no desire to change my situation.  I need a deli that delivers.  This living room is covered with flecks of dried drink.&nbsp; I think I broke a glass, but I don't remember.&nbsp; One is in the sink, both shotglasses, and one is MIA.&nbsp; Ah well, when I step on glass, I'll have my answer.  This is how every Saturday morning goes, more or less.&nbsp; I try to recreate the night before, by going through chat logs, and posts on the boards.&nbsp; I'm always hoping I didn't do anything really embarassing.&nbsp;   So strange, though, because&nbsp;I actually PREFER to do this sort of thing, on weekends.&nbsp; We're too broke to go out, like we used to, and we really can't anyway, with no one to watch Alden.&nbsp; It's either do this drunk, or sober.&nbsp; Drunk is much more entertaining, but the cleanup is a bitch.  I asked myself this a few months ago.&nbsp; Am I an alcoholic?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But, I keep checking, just in case.&nbsp;

      I was thinking about chess.  Chess pisses me off.  Checkers, too, but not so much.  You'd think it's a good game for a smart person to play.  I'm smart.  No, really, I am.  It's funny, I always feel like I have to prove myself, intellect wise.  I used to go around telling people my IQ, but I got sick of defending myself, because those people were skeptical. I don't tell people anymore.      My parents took me to the University of Louisville, when I was 5, for a thorough mental examination.  I have, in my posession, a 30 page report of every aspect of my intellect, as it was when I was 5, i.e. a very long winded IQ test.  Now, I know IQ doesn't mean everything, but I figure, a real idiot couldn't even fake it, to get that high of a score, so even if I'm not all THAT smart, there's  something  there, right?  Plus, it's, like, all I got.  When they find a way to accurately, numerically measure the more accurate 7 intelligences, I'll be all over that.  Plus, I feel like I got wholly jipped, education wise.  Thank you mom.  But, I digress, chess pisses me off.  I never learned when I was a kid. I didn't grow up around "chess people"  No one bothered to teach me.  I finally learned when I was in my early 20's.  But, I was never around anyone who took the time to teach me more than the basic moves.  The guy who taught me how to play, showed me the basics, then beat me in 5 moves.  So, naturally, I didn't really learn.  I've played all of 4 times, since.  3-4-5 moves, and I lose.  I came to the reason why, and this has a lot to do with my intellect, and how people percieve me.  I'm not a quick thinker, when it isn't crucial.  I have to stare hard at the board, and think about it forever.  I'm a deep thinker, but, I'm not that quick.  Generally, decisions I make on the fly turn out to be bad ones, so, I just don't do it anymore.  That carries over to my very meager chess game.  But, then, I get worried about looking dumb, and embarassed for taking too long, so, I punch it, and doom myself.  It's almost embarassing, not to be a quick thinker, most times.  I take a long time to answer questions.  Feels like I come off as dumb.    It's funny, because it seems like I reserve the quick thinking for when it really counts.  I'm excellent under pressure.  Pressure, in fact, is my crutch. I can't accomplish things, unless there's pressure.  I live for it.  That's when I shine.   Yes, I put off my term papers, till the last week of the term.  Yes, I produced flawless 20-30 page papers, completely cited, thoroughly thought through.  Yes, I did nothing BUT schoolwork, for those last few days.  I LOVED it.  I got a CHARGE from killing myself like that.  I've tried doing it the old fashioned way, but, my papers always come out fragmented, rambling, and, well, bad.  I make bad decisions, when I hurry, when it doesn't really count (games, ice cream flavors, etc) but, when it's crucial, when there's pressure, I'm aces.

       It's very pleasant, when someone you really, genuinely like, suprises you with a very nice statement.  Right out of the blue.  Good feeling.  Especially when you know it's not cheap flattery.  Another thing.  When it's hot late at night, and you're laying there with a weak fan blowing on you, it's sticky, you can't get to sleep, you're tired, irritated, and overheated.  Then, you hear the trees rustle, and an instant later, the wind changes and blows a cool, almost chilly breeze, over you.  That's instantly relaxing, and will knock me out, every time.

      Since we're on the house, I think it's time for me to address this phobia that I've developed.  It's packing.   In November, I packed up a ton of crap (since we were supposed to be moving in around last Christmas).  All my books, save for the three that I was reading, all the living room knicknacks, a lot of nonessential kitchen gear, like extra pots, pans, serving dishes, etc, winter clothes, summer clothes, clothes that have gotten to be too big for us, a bunch of Alden's toys...  Just, a ton of random crap, right?  Thinking we were only going to be without these things for a month, tops.  It's almost August.  8 months have gone by, that I've been without that stuff.  No biggie, nonessential, right?  Well, it's that time again, I'm afraid.  I know, deep in my heart that I should start packing again, so we can just hustle over there.  We could be living there in three weeks.  It could also take another 5 months.  We're relying on unreliable people, we have a lot of inspections to go through still, and shoot, I might wind up strangling the plumber, and we all know what a pain in the ass it is, to find a new guy, mid job.  I know I should pack, and be optimistic.  I'm not going to, though.  Not till I have the Code of Occupancy in my hand (or at least processing).  Optimism has gotten me nowhere.

      Remember the progress/no progress entry?  Well, unbeknownst to me, the boss (Joe) walked around the house, last night, checking up on what his guys did (for 3 days worth of work.  They were supposed to be there for 3 days.  6 hours, remember.) And was horrified.  He found the beer cans in the trash, knows we don't drink that shit.  He found the cigarette butts on the floor in the living room  (which even I missed), and he found that the majority of the work was uncompleted.  He fired the two guys responsible.  We thought he just took them off the job, but, turns out, he fired them.  He pulled his best guy (whom I really like, this dude named Peto) from a high $$ job, and will having him complete the work, solo.  Peto is gonna work every day, till the job is done.  It's about goddamned time things started looking up.  It's about goddamned time Joe got his shit together and started acting like a business man.

      I've been bitching a lot about the house.&nbsp; Here's some pictures to throw it all in relativity.&nbsp; Every single room was smoke damaged.&nbsp; The kitchen, dining room,&nbsp;some bedroom, and front of the utility room was actually burned. &nbsp;   The entire heating system was replaced,&nbsp; central AC was added.&nbsp; Brand new plumbing and electrical, as well.&nbsp; Everything was ripped out and replaced.&nbsp; The only original stuff is some of the floors, and most of the outside shell.&nbsp; The roof&nbsp;was ripped down to the rafters, and replaced, along with the burnt&nbsp;rafters.&nbsp; The whole covered porch was replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of behind the scenes work, too, like sagging floors had to be jacked up and joisted, a good deal of mason work, etc.  The interior changed a little, too, like the utility room, the stairs were replaced, and modified, there was a front porch, which was replaced by a front hall, and my son's bedroom.&nbsp; The upstairs was half attic, a huuuuge closet, and a tiny bedroom.&nbsp; We ripped out the walls, moved them way back, and got rid of the giant closet, trimming it to a svelte 2 ft wide. Changed it into a loft, with the bedroom door at the foot of the steps.&nbsp; One of the best features of the bedroom is the 4 ft. windows on opposing walls, turning it into an airy, sunny lofty room with a semi-view.  &nbsp;  urlLink The covered porch-before &nbsp; After the fire, before the work got started.  &nbsp;  urlLink Kitchen-before &nbsp;I wish I had a better panorama shot of the inside of the kitchen.  urlLink Kitchen-today &nbsp; No countertops, sink, stove, or fridge yet.&nbsp; Somehow Pookie managed to get her ass in the shot, too.   urlLink Utility room-before &nbsp;  urlLink front of utility room-before &nbsp; This was a long hall/laundry room thing that you had to walk through to get into the bathroom.&nbsp; We moved walls, and divided the area up, so the kitchen flows smoothly into the bathroom, and all the laundry stuff is hidden away.    urlLink utility area-today &nbsp;We moved the door to the middle of the kitchen wall, and changed the one long corridor into two rooms, essentially.&nbsp; One that leads into the bathroom/laundry room, and one laundry room.&nbsp; Freezer, hot water heater, and laundry stuff is hidden, and the furnace has moved into the attic.&nbsp; That was one of the major wall-moving renovations.   urlLink Bathroom before &nbsp; *shudder*&nbsp; The funny thing is, it was ALMOST that filthy, before the house burned.   urlLink Bathroom today &nbsp;Well, just the vanity, and sink.&nbsp; I'm so proud of the vanity and sink.&nbsp; Since the bathroom isn't a true 5', and the vanity was, we had to cut out a section of wall (after everything was freshly sheet rocked, heh).&nbsp; It slid in there, like buttah, though, and is perfect.   urlLink Living room/porch-before &nbsp;Ugh, these people loved paneling.&nbsp; That door is gone, that wall was moved 3 feet out, to enlarge that room, for my son's room.&nbsp; Instead of the front door being in the room now, there's a hallway.&nbsp; Essentially, we shaved 3 feet off the front of the room (for the hall), and widened it 3 feet.   urlLink From the middle of the living room-before &nbsp;This is sorta standing in the middle of the living room, looking towards the kitchen.&nbsp; You can see where the dining room used to be, and the utility room door.&nbsp; All gone.&nbsp; That dividing wall was yanked, and the stairs were all changed.   urlLink Living room today &nbsp;That's standing in the kitchen entry, looking out across the living room.&nbsp; The opposing wall is the boy's room.&nbsp;    urlLink living room, looking into the kitchen &nbsp; Same room, opposite angle, pardon the dust.&nbsp; You can see how the utility room was altered.&nbsp; This is right around the same spot that the before pic was taken, from the middle of the living room.&nbsp;   &nbsp; To be continued, because I'm gonna run over there and snap pics of the boy's room, front hall, stairs, loft, and more of the outside.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I've decided that July has got to go.&nbsp; Totally superfluous month.&nbsp; I decree that July will hereby be stricken from the calendar, in exchange for two Octobers.&nbsp; October is the best month of the year, we need at least twice the Octobery goodness.&nbsp; July sucks.&nbsp; Hot, sticky, nothing really going on.&nbsp; Now, I know what you're thinking, what about the 4th, what about my birthday, what about your anniversary!?&nbsp;   There's no holidays in August, so, we can just shuffle them all over to August.&nbsp; 2 months is enough for summer, I think.&nbsp; June is still fun, getting out of school, the cool late spring nights, etc.&nbsp; August is a good month for vacationing, getting ready to go back to school, enjoying the early harvests, and that slow, sleepy late summer feeling.&nbsp; July, well, meh.&nbsp; It's like summer purgatory.  Here's to the rest of summer flying the hell by, and fall getting here asap.&nbsp; Three cheers for September.

      The guys were there for 6 hours, yesterday.&nbsp; Two things were done.&nbsp; The cabinets were lifted to the ceiling, and the bottom ones were readjusted, so as to be centered.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; Six hours.  Ok, well, to be fair, they did more than that.&nbsp; They drank four beers, and stunk the house up with cigarette smoke and Lysol.

      Joe's crew is back working next door.&nbsp; For the first time since we had them removed from the property, by the cops.&nbsp;So, progress is happening, again, and that's good.&nbsp; What pisses me off about it, though, is that they were supposed to come last week.&nbsp; The mister was supposed to take a day off, and babysit them in the house, so they didn't&nbsp;steal any more stuff&nbsp;or fuck more shit up.&nbsp; Because that's what they do.&nbsp;  I only allowed them to come back and finish the job, with the stipulation that he would oversee the work.&nbsp; I can't, because I would like nothing more than to pop my thumbs through Joe's eyes.&nbsp; Joe mostly feels the same way about me, and I'm afraid the two of us on the same job would get violent.  So, I backed down, I relented about letting them finish the job, and now my only point of compromise has been ignored.&nbsp; People wonder why I stopped fucking caring about the house, all together.&nbsp; I walked off the job, and is it any wonder why?&nbsp; No one took me serious.&nbsp; No one honors their word.&nbsp; No one does things the way I specify.&nbsp; From missing inspection dates, to not returning phone calls, to blatantly disregarding blueprints, to, well, attempting to kick my ass physically, I simply can't take it anymore.&nbsp;   People who I thought were doing well have dropped the ball.&nbsp; I've been trying to get a hold of the plumber (a former close friend of mine, yes, former, the unreliable fuck) for two months.&nbsp; For every 15 or so times I call him, I get one return call, and a promise that he's gonna be there on a certain day.&nbsp; That day comes and goes, I call 15 more times, he makes lame excuses, sets a new day, wash rinse repeat.&nbsp; He has roughly 3 hours of work left to do.&nbsp; The mister has done everything he knows how to do, so far, there's just a few more little things for the plumber to do, with his special plumber tools.&nbsp; Hell, I bet if we had the tools, we could do that shit.  This project has shown me the nasty underbelly of humanity.&nbsp; Sounds dramatic, I know.&nbsp; Lying, theiving, drug addicted, unreliable, disrespectful, alcoholic, misogynist assholes, the lot of them.&nbsp; At this advanced stage, even the 'good' ones, have made my shit list.  &nbsp;

      I'm starting to believe it, even.&nbsp; So, I've homogenized my little group of eFriends (who are starting to mean more to me, then some people I know irl, but that's another entry, I think).&nbsp; But, they're all on the west coast.&nbsp; Which means, when I'm free to talk (my early morning and afternoon) they're all sleeping.&nbsp; When I should be sleeping (like, after midnight here) their parties are just getting started, or they just settle in for a night of being online.  My schedule is evolving in this weird way.&nbsp; A few factors cause it, like my lack of jobby things to do, the house is in stasis, Alden's not in school, so nothing drags me out of the house at 7 a.m., etc.&nbsp; That's all a fact, but the formative thing is the west coast friends.  I find myself staying up till three, and sleeping till 11.&nbsp; Getting housework&nbsp;, job work, &nbsp;and errands done before three, when they all generally tumble out of bed, and then I can kiss off the rest of the day.&nbsp;   It's a strange, easy going schedule.&nbsp; So far, it isn't causing problems, but it's definitely different.&nbsp; Plus, some people are worth it, seriously worth it.

      Sometimes, as a parent, ya just have these moments.&nbsp;   So, I ordered a new di- er, novelty cock, right?&nbsp; A cute one, from a German company, in the shape of Aphrodite.&nbsp; Got it on Friday, discarded the packaging.&nbsp;   Those wacky Germans included this long pamphlet with a whoooooole range of their other products.&nbsp; Some vibrating, or water proof, some 100% silecone, a myriad of colors LUCKILY, none realistic looking.&nbsp; When I say long pamphlet, the thing&nbsp;unfolded to&nbsp;about 2 feet long.&nbsp; I was amused with it, so, I folded it all back up, and used it as a bookmark.  This morning, I get up, and I found a section of it on the floor.&nbsp; The boy found it.&nbsp; I asked him where the rest of it was.&nbsp; He was like "that paper with all the magic wands on it?"&nbsp; Me:&nbsp; "Yes, yes, that's exactly right, the one with all the magic wands on it. May I have the rest?"&nbsp; He produced it, all torn to pieces, I garbaged it, as I should have yesterday.  I'm so flustered.

      This morning was beautiful. The sun is shining, it was in the high 60's low 70's, perfect. Perfect. I got up early, set Alden up with a nice breakfast of waffles and fruit, talked to my mom on the phone for an hour, and decided to go take a nap. The perfect napping weather. All the windows open, sun warming the pillows.  Alden seemed ok, eating, watching a little TV. All was right with the world.  15 minutes into my nap. "The dog puked in the bathroom, mommy" He's a capable boy. They're his dogs, too. Not one to give up the nap so easily, I said "go clean it up, with paper towels" And that was that.  He comes in a little later and says "I'm waiting for it to dry, it's too slimy." I told him to just clean it up, and make sure he washes his hands really good, after.  After the phone ringing about 6 times, all the interruptions, I decided it was time to give up the ghost, and say fuck the nap. Dissapointing, but I'm ok with it.  The very first thing I noticed was a looooong trail of paper towels leading out of the bathroom (or into) all still hooked together. I counted 14.  Followed the trail into the bathroom, where I was greeted by a the sight of a  small mountain  of paper towels. Every square inch of the bathroom floor is covered in paper towels, some, inexplicably, have clothes pins clipped to them. Topping off the whole scene, is the empty roll standing on end, on the toilet lid. The layers thicken around the middle of the floor, creating an almost plateau-like effect.  "what's this?"  "I didn't want to touch the puke"  "You know, most people can get the job done with one or two paper towels."  *silence*  "pick them all up, put them in the garbage, and I'm taking $3 out of your bank, to pay for a replacement roll. Make sure you clean up the puke, underneath. Wash your hands when you're done, and then come talk to me"  "ok"  No yelling. No voice raising. He's a good boy, a smart boy. I thought we handled it well.  Then I walked into the living room. Background: My living room carpet is a very deep hunter green. Not today, though. Today, it was white, with some green poking through it.  I'm not a screamy mother. I seldom raise my voice. This time, I think I just gasped, and maybe let out a little screech.  "What is all over the floor?" (still calm, though, strained)  "um. powder."  That's when the smell hits me. It's rather mentholated. He dusted the entire living room with Gold Bond.  "WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!"  "It smelled good, and I wanted to trace my toys on the floor."  Oh yeah, look at that, there's outlines of trolls and GI goes. Huh, cool.  "WITH GOLD BOND?! THAT SHIT COSTS 10 bucks a bottle!!!! LOOK AT THIS MESS WHAT THE FUCK POSESSED YOU!?!" (I'd pretty much ditched calm, by now)  *silence*  "*sigh* When you're done with the bathroom, you can come in here and clean this shit up. I'm taking another $10 out of your bank, for the cost of the powder, and when you're done in here, you can spend the rest of the day in your room. You can't seem to be trusted today."  "but..."  "go. now. before I start yelling again."   That wouldn't be bad, if that were it. I wish it were. He finished the bathroom, then I help him in the living room, moving my stuff around, so he can clean better. Then I had to pee.  Bathroom looks pretty good. I disinfected the floor, though, just to be extra clean about it. The kitchen garbage is filled with the spent roll of paper towels, all is well.  Till I opened the lid of the toilet.  Picture if you will, a solid wet mass of paper towels, coming halfway up the inside of the bowl. No water, but, only paper towels. There's more. Perched on top of the paper towels is a neat little pile of poop. So well arranged, you would think someone sculpted it there. The poop was entirely out of the water. It looked like it was drying, there.  I didn't scream. I might have let out a half-barking whoop. Shut the lid. Walked into the living room.  "did you put paper towels in the toilet?"  "yes" (he's such an honest kid)  "knowing the toilet was clogged, did you then poop on top of the paper towels?"  "I had to go"  *erk*  I closed the lid, closed the door and walked back into the living room. He resumed toiling away at the powder, but he wasn't doing so well.  At this point, I was at a juncture. Don some rubber gloves, and handle the situation, without getting too worked up. Then pee in peace. OR Walk past the closed up bathroom, and go pee in the yard. Or, pee in the bathtub. I did what any one of you would do. I sat down at the computer, and bitched to a friend about it. He confirmed that I should, indeed leave the door closed, and probably sell the house. I was getting desperate. I went back there, and stood in the doorway, staring maniacally at the tub.  Just then, the door opened up. Bill to the rescue!!! He noticed the strange look on my face. He came over, to see what I was looking at. I pointed at the toilet lid.  The situation basically took care of itself, from there. He's a screamer. He ranted and raved, and yelled at poor Alden. He screamed, but while he screamed, he threw on the trusty rubber gloves, and took care of the situation. He made Alden stand there and watch while he pulled a full 300 lbs of sodden, shit covered paper towels out of the bowl. He made him tie the bag, and drag it outside. All the while, I was sorta telling the morning's events, backwards.  The toilet got taken care of. I redisinfected the floor, toilet, walls, etc... I got to go pee. Alden was in his room, crying. Bill made some lunch for us.  I had to stick Alden in the shower, after lunch, though. All that shit, puke, and powder, god knows what was on him. He's clean, and calm. I'm calm and relieved. The living room still looks like it snowed.  I'm, like, tired again.  Maybe I should go take a nap...

      I was gonna sum up that ridiculously long road trip story, with this insight:  Harriet is one of those friends.   Bill called her a pork chop.  You gotta trim off a lot of crap, before you get to the good part.  It's good, but, a lot of work.  She couldn't hold out her act for so long, so when it tapered off, and all that was left was the true person, she's good, and a good friend.  Take her away from the audience, and, everything normalizes.  We still laugh together, at those times, cry on each other's shoulders, etc.  We have a lot of deep down stuff in common, and I know my stability is good for her to be around.  Her outgoingness is probably good for me, saves me from being a total hermit.  Despite all my bitching, and all her bizarre personality flaws, they're not without reasons, and she's still an alright person.

      Scroll down and read Dread first, if you haven't already.  I broke this one into chapters.  She pulled up and honked.  I was busy slamming tequila shots, and lamenting to Cao and Xan, on what a suckass night this was turning into, and trying to figure out a way to make some fun for myself.  I took my sweet ass time getting out there too, I lingered over a book selection, had to find my missing hairbrush, count the cash that was in my pocket, double checking all the stuff in my bakcpack, etc.   When I got outside, I noticed that she wasn't in the Durango, she brought her uncle's car, the Merc.  Clean, nice, huuuuge backseat, etc.  That was the first plus.  The second thing was, no kids!  Just DJ, her 14 year old nephew, whom I like.  He's a good kid, funny, sharp sense of humor, pretty quiet.  If I could tune her out, this looked like it would be a decent road trip.  I like going for car rides, in general.  With the right people, it's a cool way to spend time together, see some sites, etc.    The first 40 minutes, she ranted about having to go out at rush hour, on a Tuesday night, and that she was gonna miss her shows, and it was gonna rain, and how much DJ's dad is a bastard for making her take this trip, blah blah blah.  DJ was just like "hey, whaddya gonna do" .   I busied myself making phone calls, ignoring her, reading, joking with DJ, and demanding that we stop for some coffee and food.  Since she was on the phone for most of that time, the music was blessedly off.  She talks on the phone so much, it's awful.  Bitching to her sister, bitching to her husband, bitching to Don, her sister's husband, bitching to her aunt and uncle, that were taking care of the kids, bitching at her kids, bitching to her other friends, etc etc etc.  Once she dried up all her avenues of phone calling and bitching at, she quieted down, and the music went up.  Bill alternately snoozed, commiserated with her bitching, and chatted with me.  He could sleep on a picket fence, I swear it.   We stopped for pizza at a rest stop halfway there, and I insisted on eating in the place.  I hate eating in the car, I get carsick.  We lingered over pizza, salad, dessert...  till she got so antsy, she started pacing.  The rest of the trip up there was mostly cool, she finally calmed the fuck down, and settled into a nice driving groove.  Stopped being ragey, stopped screaming at everyone, and we were having normal conversation, for once.  It was pretty nice.  She even put on the radio, to a mix easy listening type station, so that we didn't have to endure one more goddamned Toby motherfucking Keith song.   We weren't driving the kid all the way home, she and her sister visit so often, and take each other's kids so much, that they have a planned halfway point.  This gas station smack in between their two houses.  That is where we were going, I didn't even know it, till we were almost there.  We were supposed to be there at 8, to meet Don, but we got there at 9:15 (hehe, oops).  Get there, and no Don.  Turns out Don had to work late, and he had only been on the road for an hour.  He'd be there in another hour.  Shit.  So, she started driving all over the area, looking for something to do.  Place called New Paltz, turned out to be a little college town, SUNY was right there, and there were tons of cool little stores, sorta like a New Hope, but, in NY.   Only, at 9:30, they were all closed.   The only thing open was our gas station, a strip club, and a laundromat.  We serisouly debated popping into the strip club, and leaving Deej in the car.  I couldn't do it, though, shoot, the kid is only 14.  We wound up going back to the gas station, and waiting around till 10:30, for Don to show up.  Uneventful.  She paced around and whined about waiting, but that was nothing, really.  The trip home was interesting.  I sat in the front (and controlled the volume knob ;) It was late, no one around to call, no one to put on a show for.  Like, she stopped 'acting' her scary monster persona, and started being a normal, nice person.  We had a deep (two way, for once, rather than me listening) conversation about our similar childhoods, she didn't know how similar, till last night.  She didn't know that I went through, growing up.  I'd heard bits of her story, but now I know more.  I think she takes me a little more serious, now that she knows stuff.  Bill listened, added his insight to stuff, and it was very cool.  We got home after midnight, and I was in a decent mood.  The trip went well, I was reminded more of why I choose to be her friend, and it was a productive evening.  More on that, later.

      Yesterday took a weird turn. Started out normal and slow, changed up midway.  Went to Target with my mom in the early afternoon, normal. Pulled into the driveway, and Bill's on the phone. He said "here, ask her" as I hop out and start grabbing my bags. I took the phone, thoroughly confused, and it was Harriet. You guys remember Harriet...  She was going to upstate NY, to take her nephew home. He was visiting, and his dad needed him home a few days early, to work. She called, because she was looking for a ride partner, so she didn't have to come back alone. 4 hour round trip.  First thing that struck me: Why didn't she call my number? Why did she call Bill? Any other day, he'd have been at work, or driving from the county job, to his first batch of lawns. He'd have been busy, wheras, around 4 p.m. I'd be just getting home from running around all morning. Seemed illogical.  Second thing: I've invited her to hang out about 6 times, since the end of the school year. She's bailed almost every time, save for 4th of July, when we all went and saw fireworks, together. I felt a little used. Don't call to hang out, but call when you need something. I wouldn't normally be so suspicious, but that's the nature of her way, I've seen her do it to people before, and now it was my turn.  Third thing: The woman's ego. She's been a monster to be around, lately. She's a chain smoker, she listens to loud country music, when she drives, and she won't stfu for three seconds. When she's not on her phone, she's talking about how this guy thinks she's hot, or how she flirted with that pizza guy. Her kids are screamy, and I hate them, pretty much. Whenever we go anywhere in her car, it's insta migrane. Between her mouth, smoking, the music, the cartoons blasting on the DVD player in the back, the air conditioner drying out my eyeballs, and the kids screaming to compete with the rest of the noise...yeah, that's an accurate picture of my private hell. Plus, she's road ragey, and drives like a fucking lunatic.    I told her, I'd call her back when my mom left, and I'd had a chance to digest the info.  Now, I had promised to take Alden to this town picnic thing, the National Night Out, on the beachfront, he was looking forward to it. I told Bill, to call her back, and tell her we couldn't go, we were taking Alden out. My mom wanted to take him, also, but I figured since Bill was home, we'd go as a family instead. He balked. He said "But I hate those things, I don't want to go, plus I told her I'd go with her already."  Enter: Suspicion. He HATES going places with her. For the same reasons I mentioned. He's the worst complainer, he's the one that pushes for seperate cars, whenever we'd go anywhere. So, add "why the fuck would you want to go?" to "why the fuck didn't you call my phone?" and you have this growing ball of suspicion.  I did the only thing I could think of. Call him on it, then invite myself. Hustled the boy off to Nana's, and set myself up for a roadtrip to hell. He didn't even realized how the situation looked, but you take this voraciously sexual predator of a woman, angling to be with my husband (whom she thinks is attractive) alone for at least two hours, and you have something that just doesn't look right.  I trust him, naturally. We have this perfect love, perfect trust, thing. Hell, I'd probably let him go along with anyone else, even if I knew for sure they were gonna do something...buuuut, this is personal. I've got it in my mind that this woman is trying to steamroll me, and go after Bill. She's just that kind of girl.  See, I'm normally not suspicious at all, about anything, but she makes me wonder. She calls him sometimes, for landscaping advice, car questions, etc. Sometimes she shows up where he gets his coffee in the AM and buys. Stuff like that. Add to that, we already had a Situation, a few years ago, where a woman was actively pursing him, and trying to cut me out of the picture...and, well, you can see why I would worry a little.  He realized what he had accidentally done, by being so amiable. He just said yes, without even thinking about what it was gonna be like, or that we had plans (admittedly, I hadn't really enforced the whole town picnic thing, he thought my mom was taking Alden). He's very good natured like that, though, one would call him a pushover. Shirt off his back kinda guy.  So, we both went.

      Bill, as Caoilin has arbitrarily titled The Mister (which I like, because it's more concise), is a disaster.  First of all, let it be known, that he is the rashiest mo'fo on two legs.  If he were a female, we could call it "sensitive skin" but he's not, so, he's just rashy.  In the 7+ years we've been together, I don't think a week has gone by, where he didn't have some kind of poison ivy, or plant infection, or reaction, or   something.     He used my Dial Antibacterial wash, the other day,  the stuff I keep around to wash all the piericings. Apparently he didn't rinse well enough.  Sunday morning, he had an outbreak of faint pink bumps across his chest, and arms.  It got worse, throughout Sunday.  By Sunday night, they were getting red, and they were on his arms, back, neck, legs, ass, and...everything in between.  The only spot he didn't have it, was the middle of his back, which is why we think it was the soap.  You can almost see where he swiped the washcloth.  Monday morning, he left for work, and I didn't get to examine him, but when he came home last night, he was bright, angry red, from head to toe.  The bumps melted together, till he was a walking puffy hive.  His face was puffy and swollen, and he had a raging fever.  Poor spotted man.  I made him soup, made him take Benedryl, and some Tylenol, made him shower with baby wash, and I used an entire bottle of Caledryl on him, and made him lay down and go to sleep.  He looked like a tomato, left out in the sun to go over.  He took off of work today, but insisted on working in the house.  He's feeling better, the bumps are fading, and the fever is gone, but now he pulled his back out, moving the range hood.  *roll eyes*   Sometimes I wish I could encapsulate him in a plastic bubble, so he doesn't fuck himself up too much.

      That took me two hours to write, down there.  I slept like the dead, afterwards, though.  It wasn't some confession, or  message to the world, it was what I do with this blog, which is try to align my own thoughts and record my feelings about shit.

      I tried to sleep, but I have this blog entry forming in my head.  It's nagging and keeping me awake.  I'm afraid if I sleep on it, it'll be distorted by tomorrow morning.  I've been thinking about this for some time.  Probably since that really unflattering picture of me went up on ACF.  This whole being fat, thing.  Lets just get this right out in the open, if it was a mystery before.  I am.  I'm big, heavy, thick, rubenesque, lush, curvy, fat, however you like to describe it, I'm it.  I wear a size 20.  I can't shop in normal stores, I have to go to the plus size sections.  I have a 38" waist.  My measurements, in fact, are 40DD, 38, 42.  I'm 5 foot 8.  Try and add all that up in your head, and try not to hurt yourself doing it.   I wear good clothes, and I make extra sure theyr'e flattering.  I spend a lot of time thinking about clothes.  I love clothes, and I really hate to see people poorly dressed.  Clothes really can make a person.   Lets take this a step further, and really pull out some imagery.  I've got wide football player shoulders, big upper arms,  and big tits.  I'm young and I have great posture, so they stand up, and point forward still, I get a lot of compliments about them, and I like showing them off.  I have a faint waistline, and hips...well, no hips.  If I was thin, they'd be described as "boyish" but, I'm not.  So, the overall effect is rather columnar.  Well, a column with huge tits.  My lower legs and thighs are still tight, and I like to think of them as powerful.  They're not covered in cellulite, and you don't have to look to hard to see muscle definition.  In fact, my calf muscles ripple when I walk.  I like looking at my legs, when I walk, I think it's pretty sexy.  I keep them tanned, tattooed, and tight, and I like to show them off.  In the past few years, though, I'm developing a nice layer of fat, around the back of my thighs.  I can't see it, so no biggie, but, it's there.  I have a round, ample belly, which is my second least favorite area (we'll get to my least favorite in a sec)  It's a point of issue for me, because they design girl's shirts, so that the hemline bisects it, and you get this nice roll of flab, hanging out.  I combat that, by wearing a lot of skirts, which skim right over the problem area, or, men's tee shirts, which cover it up.  My ass is strange.  Out of clothes, it's cute, little, and round.  In clothes, it's totally flat.  I have a few pairs of jeans that do it justice, but mostly, it's forgettable.  My face, though.  I talked about that a little before, but, my face really pisses me off.  I feel like that "two faced chick" from Seinfeld.  I look good in one light, but not the other.  I have good face days, and bad.  I have long straight hair, that reaches my lower back, and short little bangs.  I have a widow's peak, and a very pointy little chin, with a slight cleft, that make a perfect heart shape.  In between, are some nice arched eyebrows (I get complimented on my eyebrows a lot, for some reason) almond shaped green eyes, a rounded pug nose, huge full cheeks, pouty soft lips with a very defined bow, and my pointy chin.  Framing all that is a nice layer of fat.  That I hate.  I really really hate it.  It shows up when I don't want it to, in pictures.  I can work on my abs, and keep that ample belly high and tight.  I can do lunges and leg lifts to keep my shit toned.  I can lift, and stuff for my arms, but what the fuck am I gonna do about all this face fat?  Even when I was thin, I had face fat.  So, there we go, there's an honest, in depth description of myself.  Take it without bitterness, without conceit, without self deprecation, without neediness.  It's observation, inventory, and acceptance.  Accept it, or don't, but that's what this entry is about.  My acceptance, and the things that shake it.    Lemme start with being a fat kid.  I wasn't fat till about 5th grade.  As a matter of fact, from when I was born, till about 2nd grade, I was severely underweight.  I weighed 3 lbs 8 oz, when I was born.  I have very fine bones, and a small frame.  I was downright angular, when I was a kid.  We moved to NJ, when my dad and mom got divorced, and my mom stopped being Mrs. Domestic, and started being Miss Catch-Me-A-Man.  She stopped cooking all together, and I subsisted largely (pun! HAH!) on grocery store brand frozen dinners, generic canned pasta dishes, ramen noodles, government subsidied food (gub'ment cheese stains your teeth yellow.) and, the occasional Polish meal from my grandmother.   I am not going to be one of those blame laying fat people, but it is what it is.  I would go days without meat and vegetables, and eat whole pots of mashed potatoes with butter, for dinner.  I developed deplorable habits, and food addictions when I was a child, and I'm only just getting over them now.  So, where was I...5th grade, right.  That was when I first started getting teased about weight.  Before then, I got singled out, because of my accelerated learning, and being in the G&T classes (gifted and talented).  Add fat to bookish, and you have a kid's worst nightmare.  I got bullied daily, from 5th grade on.  I would sit on the playground, reading, and certain kids would mosey on over, and pick a fight with me, just because of what I was wearing, or, shit, for no reason at all.   Let me share a few horror stories, for posterity.  I've never committed any of this to print, before, but I think I'm ready to.  Once, I was at the local park, (I used to live there, just about, it was a block away from my house, and sprawling acres of alone places...digressing) and, I was by myself on a tire swing, standing up, and leaning on the chain, sorta swinging lazily.  I didn't hear them, but this whole group of kids from my school came up behind me. I thought I was alone.  I one swift motion, they knocked me off the swing, and whipped my pants down.  "PANTS" they did it to everyone.  Only, that day...I was wearing these special underwear my mom got me, to hold my tummy in.  They were these huge granny panties.  I've never worn huge underwear since.  It took me (and them) almost a year to get over it.  I feel shamed, and choked up typing it out now.  I was 11.  There was the name calling, the comments, the bullshit.  Kids would look for things to insult me about.   In 8th grade, I went through the classic scene.  One day at lunch, Popular Hot Guy came over to me, and was like "hey, are you going to the prom?"  (we had an 8th grade prom)  I was like "probably"  He said "wanna go with me?"  I flushed...because he really was good looking, and I thought, one of the nicer people around.  He'd never given me a problem before, he generally ignored me...so, I'm thinking, ooh, lucky break, right?  "Sure, I'd like that"  He said (and I'll never forget it to this day, so help me god) "I bet you would, haha, but what makes you think I'd want to go with your lardass?" He moseyed back to his friends, and they all had a good chuckle.   (semi-related side note:  He spent time in jail, later on.  He now lives with his baby momma, in her daddy's house, and get this, she's a porker.  Gogo karma! I love living in a small town.)   That's enough torturing myself.  There was a lot.  I got into about 14 fights between 5th and 8th grade.  All over stupid nonsense.  I was such a doormat, too.   Toward the end of 8th grade, I started evolving, though.  I started hanging out with the boys.  The really smart boys, the fucked up ones, the poor kids, the metalheads, the nerds, freaks, etc.  We all started listening to metal around the same time.  My best buddy Phil had tourettes syndrome.  This guy Artie that I used to hang with, was voted 8th grade validictorian, but, he got busted smoking pot on school grounds a week before graduation, heh.  8th grade.  So, yeah, we all sort of developed a rep.  I did wind up going to the prom, with this kid, who later became my first boyfriend.  We all stood in the hallway in our socks, and bare feet, them in their rented tuxes (for some reason they all wore tails.  Pretty hot, and strange) and drank out of a shared stolen pint ofJack Daniels.  Slagging on the popular kids, getting drunk, and requesting Metallica songs.  Good times good times.  That summer was awesome, I lost my virginity, ran wild, and took ownership of my self.  I started winning fights.  I started dressing like the boys, in flannels and denim, and I learned how to skate.  I stole a Mongoose, and learned how to work on it.  I biked, and skated, and fucked around.  By the time 9th grade rolled around, I was a full on asskicking metal chick.  I went to high school, with a new attitude, and new identity.  I grew a few inches, and leaned out.  I sprouted breasts, and got (meager) hips.  My hair grew out (in 8th grade, I had a bowl cut) so, I stopped looking like a boy, and started playing with them.  When I left 8th grade, I left the insults behind.  I swear to god, I never was insulted about my weight after that.  Just didn't happen.  I barely got into fights, and, our crowd was considered "scary".   So, yeah, I outgrew the fat insults, and I lived it up.  Went on like that for all of my teens.  Starting at 13.  Fast forward to age 20.  I settled down, and gained weight.  Worked nights, ate at a diner every single night, at 10 p.m. Shit food, too, gravy fries, cheesesteaks, just, the worst shit.  I gained 40lbs in 2 months.  The first time I couldn't get my size 14 jeans to button, I was hysterical. I cried all night, we didn't wind up going out, I hid in the bedroom sobbing.  The mister convinced me, that all women mature, and he assured me that my body was just changing, as I evolved into a woman.  Yeah, bullshit.  I got pregnant 2 months later, and by then, I gained fully 80 lbs.  After I had my son, I was all but bedridden for a few months, due to major complications, and I never lost that weight.   Two years later, I had pneumonia, that went untreated, for a month, and bronchitis for over a year.  Long story short, major scar tissue in my lungs, and  I couldn't walk between rooms, without getting winded.  Hello another 40 lbs.   I've always been active.  The health problems laid me up, and I went into the worst depression of my life.  During all this weight gain, the mister assured me that I was still his goddess, etc, still beautiful, but I was very hard on myself.  God, I was so depressed.  Right around that time, too, Tom killed himself, and the whole 9-11 thing, I just wasn't happy for a whole year. Just thinking about it is making me want to cry.  I was a size 24.  Somehow, I got out of that, did two more semesters of school, then the house thing happened. I didn't have time to wallow in my own self pity, after that, I was too busy worrying about being homeless.  The beginning of this year, the mister and I decided to make some changes.  He went on a full on diet.  Lost almost 90 lbs.  I  didn't go on any diet, but I started eliminating poisons from my own regimen.  No junk food, no refined sugar, hydrogenated shit, no more crap.  No more shit food.  Not a diet, but, a descision.  I woke up, one day, at my mom's house, after I tested my blood, on her diabetes thing.  My blood sugar level was astronomical.  Up there around "borderline diabetic".  I dropped 40 lbs, like *that* without even trying.  I'm still not trying.  I'm training myself, though.  I work out now, I do basic yoga and pilates, and I can do 3 miles on treadmill at 5 mph, without wheezing.   It's a good feeling, to be out of breath, but not ready to collapse and die, seeing stars.   I do dozens and dozens of reps with 15 lb weights, daily.(I know, sounds like nothing, but I couldn't go get the mail without having to catch my breath.  Thank you pneumonia.)  I love the control of pilates and yoga, I love feeling my body elongate, and controling myself that way.  I like the power involved, and the concentration.  When I first started, I felt like an akward oaf, now I'm getting more graceful.  I still eat, I don't deny myself much, but the difference is (and there's a big one) food isn't like IT anymore.  My day used to revolve around meals.  Now, I make other stuff more important.  Food addiction is a hard one to kick, because you have to eat to live.  People don't need to smoke to live.  You have to go out of your way to get cigarettes.  Food, there's food everywhere. I have to cook three meals of it, a day, at least.  I used to work in kitchens professionally.  I LOVE FOOD.  I read cookbooks, for LEISURE.  Food science and chemistry is a major hobby of mine.  It's unavoidable, so I had to change my mindset. It's working, slowly.  Slowly.  So, this is where I'm at now.  Acceptance, progress, change.  I'm sort of meeting myself half way here.  I was sick of being a slug, so I'm changing that.  I'm less about losing weight, and more about getting healthy.  I've accepted my size, and for the most part, how the world views me.  Frankly, I think fat is sexy, on me, and on other people.  I love the way my skin feels, and the generousness of my hips. I run my hands over my belly, and like that roundness. I feel fertile, and lush, and goddesslike.  I'm adding grace and strength to that, and I feel good, and I feel like I look good.  I'm owning my fat, once again.   They saw my picture a few weeks ago, on ACF.  First time I've heard nasty, bullying barbs about my weight, since I was 13.  Thirteen years, and the insults have come full circle.  It doesn't hurt, anymore, though, not like it used to.  It used to lessen my self worth, when I was young. I felt like a lesser person.  It hurt, it made me hate, and it made me want to isolate myself, and fight, and I did.  Now, I'm a fighter, and I hate, still.  I look down on those people, like they looked down on me when I was a kid.  It feels, now, though, that these "grownups" have to insult my appearance, because they have nothing else.  They can't touch my logic, or my personality.  They have to go for cheap, easy shots, and attack my size.  How...8th grade, of them.  I wonder, though, would they do it in a real life setting?  Would they attack someone they worked with, in such a way?  Do they yell at the girl behind the counter for screwing up an order, and call her a fat bitch?  Some people do, actually.  When I got into that brawl with my contractor, the first insult out of his mouth was (again, till the day I die, I'll never forget this) "fat psycho cunt"  then "fat dike bitch"  Now, though, it's less about me, and more about society.  Is this what it's about?  Is that all people see?  That's one thing I'm still having a hard time coping with.  What people see, when they see me.  The fat is always a first impression, I see it in people's eyes, in the split second, when we first meet.  It's like "hello fat, hello Lisa"  Fat first, Lisa second.  I make up for that, though.  I look eccentric.  I try extra hard to be 'different' in other ways.  I try to be extra learned, and extra super witty.  I have a great sense of humor.  All these things, I do to eradicate that first impression.  It's my arsenal of self-protection, my way of standing out.      This entry was a long time coming.  I've been dancing around it, for awhile.  It feels good to pour it all out. I think I can sleep well, again.

      I haven't blogged about my parents much, but, I feel like I want to.  I think the thing that's been holding me back is that I have a whole lot to say about both of them.  I'm going to start small, and with the most immediate thing.   Today, I went to go get my nails done.  My mom had Alden, so, perfect opportunity.  She said, "oh, that's cool, I was planning on going Monday, too, with Carrie (her friend)"  I was like, "oh, hey, I'll tag along with you, so I have someone to talk to" .  By her response, I could tell that she didn't want me along, for whatever reason, so I went later on.  That's cool.   What was really cool, is that they were just leaving, as I got there, and I found out that she paid for my manicure/pedicure, already.  How sweet was that?  My mommy hooks me up.  I never ask for a thing, from them, but she's free with the treats.  It's always been that way, though.  I can honestly say, we were poor, when I was growing up, but pretty much, when she had it, I never wanted for anything, ever.  I think it's her way of making up for all the really awful things.  More on that, another time.  But, it's like her apologizing, without having to say "I'm sorry."  So, this evening, we talk on the phone.  I made the offhand comment, that I wish Alden would clean his room here, the way he takes care of his stuff there.  She goes on and on about how tidy he is, and how well he cleans up after himself.  I mostly think she's bullshitting, but that's her way.  So, I said "I wish I could get him to do things like that at home!" sorta joking, y'know.  She says this "Well, his room HERE isn't a tiny little shithole."  I was like "Excuse me? Shithole?"   Then, further..."well, the dogs shit in there, right?  Isn't it all covered with dog shit, and stuff?"  "his room?!" (I was literally gaping, at the phone.  I mean, who the fuck says that?)  "yeah, the dogs sleep in there, right?"  "You think Alden's room is the house litterbox, and all the animals all shit in there? Is that what you're saying?"  "Well, it sounds bad when you say that..."  "Um."  The conversation continued.  She was feigning honest cluelessness at what she was implying.  Like people go around saying that kind of shit, every day.  His room is smallish, and cluttered, but it's because it's filled with toys and clothes.  The animals are only in there to stand on his bed and bark out his window (it overlooks the front porch).  She must see them there every time she comes over, and assume that they live in there (I really don't know where she gets the whole shit thing, except that when we got Pookie, she wasn't housetrained, and shat all OVER the house, occasionally on his rug.)  But, to her, dogs=filth.  So, she sees the dogs in his room, and assumes that it's filthy.  It isn't.  What kind of mother would I be, if I let my son lived in filth?  Just her implying it, like, stings me.  I don't know why, but she really hits those buttons.  She makes these offhand comments about how she dissaproves of my mothering, how I keep my house, my abysmal taste, etc etc etc.    Before I became a mother, she would make snide digs about the house, the husband, etc.  When I lived at home, she attacked my appearance, constantly, my intellect, just...my existence.  Then, 3 seconds later, she gives this wide-eyed look and says (This makes me so angry, I can't even express my feelings about it in words) "Why, I'm sorry you FEEL that way, I don't really know why you're getting so upset..."  She never ever says "I'm sorry"  She's not sorry.  I don't think she's been sorry for anything in her life.  She's sorry that you aren't taking her "constructive criticism" and bettering yourself with it.   It's this daily dance.  She says things that are totally volatile, she's a pushy,  catty, nasty bitch 80% of the time (she's even taken it upon herself to 'decorate' Alden's room, in the new house.  We're letting her, but we're gonna take it all down, when we move in. It's just easier...)  But, the other 20% she's giving, supportive, etc.  She's never  honest.  Never reliable.  And, I'm never sure what percent I'm gonna run into when we talk.   I'm counting my blessings that I moved out of there early on, because I am very sure that we would kill each other.  I'm also lamenting, sometimes, that we live 9 blocks apart.  Because sometimes, that feels way too close.
