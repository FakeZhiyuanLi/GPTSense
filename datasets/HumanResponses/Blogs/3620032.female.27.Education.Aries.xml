      well, it's been a crazy week with meetings at school and getting things ready for the first day of school on monday.  i am very excited about school starting.  we had orientation on thursday so i got to meet some of my kids and their parents.  i have already figured out which kids i will have to keep an extra eye on.  it doesn't take long:)  anyway, we (the other sixth grade teacher and i) will both have 24 students in our class (which means i'll have 48 kids this year).  that's a lot of kids in my tiny classroom but i'm excited because that means more kids to share Christ with.  i'm praying that the kids that don't know Jesus will come to know Him very soon, and the ones that already know Him will be able to grow closer to Him during this school year.  i love teaching language arts and history, but the best part about teaching at parkway is being able to witness to my kids and see God working in their lives throughout the year.  i get so excited thinking about seeing kids accept Jesus as their Savior.  that's why i am there!!

      things to say when someone asks, "why aren't you married yet?"  1.  "you haven't asked yet." (you have to be careful who you say this to!) 2.  "because i just love hearing this question." 3.  "just lucky, i guess." 4.  "it gives my mother something to live for." 5.  "my fiance is awaiting his parole." 6.  "i'm waiting 'til i get to be your age." 7.  "i wouldn't want my parents to drop dead from sheer happiness." 8.  "why aren't you thin?" 9.  "i am married.  where have you been for the last two years." 10. "God still wants to keep me all to Himself." 11. "why do you ask?" 12. "why am i single?  it's a mystery right up there with who shot JFK? and why don't other countries have better toilet paper?" 13. "it's easy to become married - 2.3 million people do it a year.  if you want to pressure me to become something, hey, why not pick something a little more challenging - like an astrophysicist." 14. "according to the u.s. census bureau, good things do come to those who wait."

      i've been lazy today, which has been very nice.  all i've done is sleep, watch tv, and eat.  i figured that i needed one of those lazy days where i did nothing before school starts on monday.  i thought about unpacking my suitcases, but i haven't done it yet.  i have these two suitcases from my trip to mexico that i haven't unpacked.  i got them a month ago, and they've just been sitting there.  i've been dreading unpacking them.  i guess if i haven't needed anything that's in there so far, then i probably won't need anything that's in there any time soon.  i'd like to just throw them away, but i guess i need to unpack them and find out what's in them.  i think it's mostly clothes that are too big for me - clothes i took to mexico and now cannot wear because i lost so much weight while i was in mexico.  i just keep looking at them and hoping that they will unpack themselves.  i guess i will eventually have to go through them.  ok...enough about my suitcases from mexico.  ttfn!

      do everything without complaining or arguing - philippians 2:14  i went to the school today and ate lunch with angie and rachael.  when i walked in rachael's office i noticed that she had written that verse on the board on her door.  then tonight at church the pastor preached on that verse.  do you ever feel like God is really trying to get something through your head?  well, i feel this way now.  i know that sometimes at school, i can be negative about things that are going on, things i have to do, etc.  i think God is telling me to just do what He has called me to do without complaining so much.  i said that when i came back from mexico that i was not going to complain about things especially at school because of what i had to put up with there.  i said i would just be happy to be back at parkway teaching.  well, yesterday, i started complaining about some things, which i shouldn't have done.  so i guess God has just sent me a friendly reminder (twice) that i shouldn't be complaining about anything.  and i realize that when i'm complaining about things, it just stresses me out more and affects others around me too.  so, i'm gonna try to do my best to do everything this year at school (whether i want to do it or not) without complaining or arguing.  cause it doesn't do me or anybody else any good.  wow...that verse has already made such a huge difference in my attitude.  i'm praying that God will help me to obey this verse every minute of every day.   let me add verse 15 to that also. do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe.  that's what i want to be...blameless and pure, a child of God without fault, and shining like stars in the universe.  i think i will put this verse somewhere on my desk so that i will see it and be reminded of it every day.  or better yet, it's a great verse for 6th graders to be reminded of everyday also...so i'll probably put it up on the wall!

      i've been so busy the past couple of weeks getting ready for school.  i think i've been at the school everyday.  i am excited but also VERY tired.  i'm glad that i'm getting everything done though, cause i like to get everything done early so i'm not stressing out right before school starts.  my room is officially ready (YEAH!!!) and it looks great (i think anyway).  it better look great cause i've spent forever getting it ready.  maybe i'll take a picture and put it on this thing if i can figure out how to post pictures again.  now i'm working on all the paperwork (typing, copying, etc.) that needs to be done and my plans.  i found out today that i will have 22 kids in my class.  i'm glad though cause i didn't like it when i only had one or two students in a class when i was in mexico.  i was bored.  well, there is never a dull moment with 22 sixth graders.  i'm so happy to be back here in b'ham teaching 6th grade at parkway again.
