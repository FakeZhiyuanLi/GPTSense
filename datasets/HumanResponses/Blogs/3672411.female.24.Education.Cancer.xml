      What is it about warm weather that turns hetero men into brain damaged "an anvil just fell on me" victims? Very weird. It doesn't even matter if the women are amply clothed, in layers..if the sun is shining and it's May or later there are women all over the city fighting men off with sticks.  Interestingly enough,  urlLink Slash 's Identical Twin asked me out on the subway today. He was hairy, tattooed, not wearing a shirt underneath his leather vest, very afroed, wearing a weird hat and ripped jeans with magic marker drawings all over them, holding a cigarette, and had black teeth. His approach was to get up and stare at my face, then ask me what I was doing for the day. It was hard not to laugh. Ordinarily I'd feel a twinge of guilt about that, but he was awfully persistent..must've asked me five times if I wanted to go out and have a drink with him.     I should've asked what kinda goofballs he was hepped up on. As he was trying to step off the train he crashed into the doors before they opened.

      After having watched the original  urlLink Fast Times at Ridgemont High DVD , I must hail to the chief that is  urlLink Cameron Crowe . He's like the grandaddy of the young person's character film. I challenge any John Hughes fan to duel with me over that one...  Thanks to Lauren and the good folks at  urlLink Shoppers Drug Mart  for giving it to me.  The thing that strikes me the most about Fast Times after watching it a few times again with commentary is how gritty it feels. Contemporary teen movies just look plain lame in comparison...I think this too about the original  urlLink Degrassi Series  when compared to the slick looking junior high series Disney and Nickelodeon are so guilty of.     So apparently the new DVD has all the deleted scenes in it, which i would love to see. However if I ordered it I would have the VHS, original DVD and rerelease DVD. That may be overkill, even for me.

      It's a bad sign when you've been using a laptop for 14 consecutive hours simply because you've got a new toy to play with.  But I do have to confess that  urlLink I love mine ...      urlLink Lucy  is in my lap dreaming as I type this. I guess she knows there's something new competing with her attention.

      ...makes you feel like a woman.  YIPPEE!  I just realised that since my date has been pushed back I can go see the  urlLink Magnetic Fields  concert on July 3.  Who wants to come with me?

      Have I ever been spoiled getting all this time with the cats during the day. Lucy is sitting in my lap right now and I'm coming to realise I'll only have a couple more weeks to bask in their adorable ways before having to leave them for at least a year.  Do you think she knows?     I've also been listening to the song  urlLink Babies  by Pulp a lot lately. Muy depressing.

      Just got back my roll of film from May 24 weekend. There are some funny ones that are along the same lines as my digicam shots:              The rest are  urlLink here .  Also got my new glasses and contacts yesterday. Apparently the original fitting they did on my contacts was totally inaccurate.  urlLink Finally I can see !

      Picture from a farewell outing with Ali last night..we made a  urlLink Rolaids is Relief  stop at Honest Ed's before starting the drinking binge..     Is it just me, or is this Elvis bust the sluttiest thing you've ever laid eyes on? Frosted blue eyeshadow all over the place, runny mascara, bubblegum pink lipstick outside the lines, and blush with 50% face coverage...apparently someone is out to make the  urlLink King  look like a  urlLink crack whore .  We had dinner at  urlLink Sushi on Bloor  (I don't think anyone could argue that you could get more food for $15 with tax and tip), then headed out to some patios in the Annex to knock back some drinks. A very weird thing happened when we were at Future's--I saw this science teacher who taught at my old high school walk by and he spotted me recognising him. I dropped my sister's name to him since science was never my fort√©, then I asked him about his wife who used to teach at my elementary school. It was all very weird. Then after saying goodbyes and such, he swings by his wife to say hello! That was kind of cute.  Yet more proof it's an eerily  urlLink small world .

      Apparently I'm 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration.  Wait, how did that commercial go again?  Here's  urlLink Peter's Blog . The picture he chose was the picture I chose to photo-print at Costco. It came out quite nicely I must say. Annie is showing off her muscular legs in it..very distracting.

      There is positively no logic to the pricing of  urlLink Air Canada  tickets whatsoever.  Our travel agent got me a cheaper ticket to Narita Airport for $845.00, all taxes included, with less notice than we reserved the last one. Go figure.  I collected the letter from my doctor's office (she is still using a  urlLink dot matrix printer !!) stating I am "healthy and free of any communicable diseases".  That's one spot of good news.

      Well, we've hit the first snag due to lack of attention to detail at the immigration office. I got an email from my HR guy saying the officials need an english translation of my  urlLink Latin Diploma  when there is already one on the back of the degree.  *sigh*  Now we've lost a day on the FedEx-ing. I wish people would pay closer attention instead of jumping to conclusions and spazzing out sometimes.

      Thanks to my cousin  urlLink Lisa  for telling me about TalkBroadBand technology.  Check it out:   urlLink Broadband Voice Gateways are cool .  Here's how it works:     This will allow me to have a 'portable landline' with a local 416 phone number (no long distance charges apply) that I just plug into the Voice Gateway from my high-speed internet jack. It can be either cable or DSL. Pretty cool, non?  That's a way to stick it to the Long Distance Service Providers...

      'Twas the last supper tonight with high school friends. Turns out Carmen and I are leaving on the same day..it was still somewhat surreal (I guess it will be until I'm at the airport) saying our goodbyes 'n stuff. All I can say is that I'm so very lucky to have met all of these special people. And no, I don't mean "handicapped" when I say "special". Thank you so much Aliza for hosting and putting so much work into this!!  I hope Peter didn't have a Homer moment from the "Lisa's Pony" episode driving home tonight (" urlLink Homer falls asleep in the doorway, the automatic doors opening and closing on his head.  He drives home and nods off at the wheel. When we return to reality, we see that the car has driven through a fence, and it careens into the Simpsons garage (taking out the mailbox and the storage shelf in the garage).  A falling circular saw clonks Homer on the head, though it doesn't seem to rouse him from his slumber.  Homer sleepwalks into bed, where the alarm goes off nary a second later .")  It is now 5:03 AM. Dear Lord how time flies with these friends! And yet I feel the need to stay up to watch the end of Pretty in Pink. I hate this movie. And yet I find James Spader to be kinda sexy in it. Go figure.  Some highlights from the night:              The rest are  urlLink here .  Enjoy..I'm going to crash now.

      I'm going to create my first proper entry right now for those bored enough to follow my journey. I'm going to write it even though I'm captivated with the IGIA Air-O-Sage air massage boots commercial.  Here's the condensed version of what has happened so far:    November 2003  - Allison applies for JET    February 2004  - Allison is rejected by JET    February 2004  to  March 2004  - Allison applies for various jobs. Allison starts getting discouraged. The terms "eikaiwa" and "cram school" start to leave a terrible taste in Allison's mouth    March 2004  - Allison applies for a position with  urlLink FIA Japan  after seeing an advertisement in the Toronto Star and  urlLink Workopolis     April 2004  - Allison has her interview with FIA Japan - Allison is offered a position with FIA Japan (yay!)    May 2004  - Allison gets her diploma early from the  urlLink registrar's office  after much badgering - Allison submits her work visa application and contracts    June 2004  - Allison graduates. Check out her matronly shoes:   - Allison books her flight to depart on June 29 - Allison continues to wait for the work visa certificate so she can bring her passport to the Japanese consulate   Obstacles along the way: requesting the diploma early (way more of a pain in the ass than I'd anticipated), squeezing the work visa process into such a constrained time period - I'm going to remain optimistic and hope it squeaks through in exactly four weeks. Wishful thinking I guess, but whatever.  Bureaucratic stuff I took care of this month: extending my OHIP coverage into Japan (a shockingly painless process), submitting blood and urine tests to my doctor as well as undergoing a full physical so I could get a letter saying I'm in good health (I finally pick the letter up on Monday), getting my eyes checked to update prescriptions.  That's all I can think of at the moment.  In the midst of all this was a glorious May 24 weekend at Doug's Cottage,  urlLink Sarah's visit to Toronto , social appointments with high school friends, university friends, and all the friends inbetween.  I'm going to also note that while this may look impressive on paper, I have done almost nothing throughout May and June. I've squandered virtually all of these two months sleeping until 1:00 PM, watching tv, surfing the internet, and occassionally taking breaks to pee.  But at long last, the anticipation is finally building! A week and a half left...

       urlLink I sold my soul to rock and roll .  That is all.  Training is wrapping up this week. First day of trainer observation/practice went o.k...am teaching almost all of them tomorrow. Unprepared. Better get cracking.  Move into my apartment right after work tomorrow. Hopefully things will settle down after that. Got nabbed with paying income taxes in Canada. You can't always get what you want.

      Status Report:  Training is going O.K. so far, Visa almost there, ticket sent back to  urlLink Air Canada  by registered mail today (thanks to Christie's boyfriend), start teaching my first classes on Tuesday (somewhat terrifying).   How is it that I manage to get lost every five minutes in a puny 55,000 subarb like Susono? I got off on the wrong side of the tracks, asked a girl if she could help me (she phoned someone who she thought could help me on her cell, then invited me to her house so that her family could escort me to where I was going, to which I could only respond "domo")..thinking that I should backtrack and ask someone at the train station but not thinking that duh..I just put my tickets into the mailbox and that the conductor would be collecting them at the other end. Thinking I was trying to ride the train free we had about ten minutes of banter in which neither of us was understanding the other. Eventually I got across that I had come from Yokohama (quoting the ticket price and arrival time) and he let me through. I gave up on asking for directions. And after all that I could have just crossed the tracks at another crossing.  Yes, I am actually the biggest moron on the face of the earth. Remember that bilge I wrote about people not having any common sense? I take it all back. *I* have absolutely nil common sense. Zero. Nyet.   I did wander around Yokohama a bit before meeting Yun for a quick dinner (thank you for the dinner, S'mores and gossip about Sistah!) and delivering her package. It does indeed seem like the "big city", so I can only imagine what that would make Tokyo if the two merged together to form a mega-Tokyo. It would kind of be like if my gut joined my thighs in some twist of flabby fate. Sometimes bigger is not better.   Total round-trip travel time to and from Yokohama on train = just over 5 hours   Some shots: ( urlLink the rest are here )     Gotta love those t-shirts that also serve as public service announcements.     Yokohama     Sewer     A squatter style toilet inside Kannai station  Questions number two and three of the night:   Why is it that I managed to see the most brazenly drunk old man passed out by the train tracks (he'd very visibly pissed his pants--which I could smell from the other side of the street--and was comatose on the ground with a cigarette in his hand..was tempted to take a photo but while I was fishing for my camera he started making noises), a run over kitten (I literally almost cried--there was blood all over the road and another kitten was sniffing it) all in lil' ol Susono?  I am slowly realising that I am becoming the worst kind of visitor. The kind who speaks no Japanese outside of "Domo", the kind who has made minimal efforts to cram Japanese in preparation for all of this, the kind that nationals have to go out of their way to struggle, help, and slide through. Seems my penchant for bothering/talking to strangers and an inability to communicate are incompatible realities right now. Hope they don't haul me off to the nuthouse like  urlLink Blanche Dubois  because I depend upon the kindness of strangers.   Can't really thank  urlLink Lisa  enough for  urlLink Season Four of the Simpsons DVD's . Despite my misguided efforts to save them for a rainy day I've already almost finished Disc One. The commentaries without Matt Groening seem to be ten times funnier than the ones without him, which leads me to believe he is not much more than a barely-creator. The show's writers and Jon Lovitz do some of the funniest stuff yet for  urlLink A Streetcar Named Marge .   Although deep down I know this will probably change sooner or later, for some reason I feel like the last single person alive in Japan. Every single F.I.A. staff member in Susono I've had any contact with so far has a boyfriend, girlfriend, fiancee, common law spouse, husband or wife. I know for certain two of the three trainers at my location also do. Not sure about the last yet but am not willing to bet against the odds.   To boot, the train was filled with leisurely day-trip couples today acting cute together. Obviously someone is out to destroy part of my Ego!   You know, I've never really apologised or even seriously felt bad about feeling single despite some efforts to make me feel like I'm somewhat handicapped for being so. I could do like Joe from "Say Anything" and say it's "by choice, man" (with the emphasis on "man") but that is only partly true (that is, only if you prefer a self-denial-filled and hazy truth). We are limited by our opportunities a good deal. And if there are only lousy, dead-ass fish left (and who knows, maybe I am a lousy dead-ass fisherman), there go the opportunities.   I also feel like I've made so many mistakes in this arena already. The next slip may be severe enough to lead to an unhappy marriage with fat children and ending in divorce. The problem is you hold out so long for the "dare to be great situation" that may or may not happen.  I think I just need someone fun to be single-miserable with here since Douglas and I are now separated by several oceans (although with the way he's been talking about Debra lately he may be leaving the club soon too). NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! In other words, all I want is for everyone I love to be happy...as long as that doesn't mean leaving me behind.   Hm.   Selfish me is acting out again.   Sure I'm young...I haven't forgotten that, but it's been a year and a half with no inkling of a prospect even, three years since a real boyfriend. I kind of feel like  urlLink Gil  the used car salesman, about to be fired for years of zero sales..and just like Gil I look and feel  urlLink equally ridiculous when reduced to such self-depreciating humiliation in an attempt to hook someone .  It's just been awhile..that's all I'm sayin'.   God forbid my emotional state of affairs when all my friends in Canada start getting married off. God forbid.  P.S. I've never been quite so frustrated as when Blogger auto-added html to the "compose" windows. I just had to re-read and corrected the entire thing.

      Alright, so the mall nearby the FIA office in  urlLink Susono  has this thing with 80's Muzak. Everywhere we walked there was a different instrumental version of an 80's song (all complete with the obligatory saxophone solo). At first I thought they had a random muzak soundtrack on and that it just happened to be a  urlLink Boy George  song but another department had "Rio" going (Duran Duran). Yet another department kept the trend going (can't remember which one now).     Fact of the day: Boy George used to eat at my dad's cousin's old restaurant ( urlLink The Ruins ) in Ocho Rios  Additional fact: "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?" was my Dad's most heavily rotated dishwashing song in the 90's.

      After several huge hurdles I'm finally here in Japan.  First there was the $3,500 open-ended return ticket Dad had to buy because I went in on a tourist visa (my work visa finally arrived two days ago; now it's a matter of going down to the immigration office to get my passport stampled in Tokyo) and they require a return ticket to let you leave. The woman who arranged the ticket at the counter said it's fully refundable - I just have to go to the Air Canada counter in Narita and show them my passport and they'll refund it on the credit card.  I hope that goes smoothly. It had better, because there's no way we are spending $3,500.     There's Lucy the globetrotter on my sister's suitcase (she just got back from Chicago).     There I go!   urlLink Adventures with Air Canada   So after a 13 hour flight, I was off the plane with my luggage by 3:30 PM on the 13th. It turns out the other fellow they hired was in the seat right behind me on the plane. Peter was there to meet us and we couriered our luggage to the office (it arrived this morning all in tact).  They had a little arrival party for us at Christie's apartment (about eight other trainers plus foreign administrative staff all live in this complex) which was nice. I had this lemon-vodka drink that Tony gave me and a beer. After that much dehydration even *I* had the common sense to stop. I gave Peter's kiddies their presents (it turns out he has two daughters, and nary a son...I hope they can find a use for the long sleeved top anyway) who are adorable.  Today I managed to get extremely lost and got the tail end of the lunch that some colleagues arranged. It so happens that one of the people I asked for directions was a student of ours and walked me directly to the office. Score.  Just a note: the roads here are crazy. Sidewalks? What are sidewalks?      urlLink More pictures around the city are here .

      I'm here. It was an exhausting trip but I'm here. My colleagues had a little party for me and the other dude who arrived today. I forced myself to stay up until 11:00 PM (Japan time) and got up at 8:00 AM..I think I'm back on track.  Sister's flaky friend now wants me to courier her stuff to her because she can't be bothered to pick it up. "I'll pay you back".  God.

      Someone please explain to me why some people are so mind-numbingly whiny and lack all sense of reason.  One of my sister's friends went to Japan in late April/early May to teach for  urlLink Nova  with the intention of taking it as an "opportunity to travel for the summer" and then proceed to break her contract in mid-August. Fine. She emails me in late June asking me if I can bring a "small package" for her to which I respond O.K.   provided it is small and light  . She says yes, it is the size of a small shoebox. Fine. Here I am thinking it is insulin or something, as my sister hands me the package today.   It's two litres of maple syrup, one package of KY-type Jelly, two packages of cookies, and EAR WAX 'PICKER' (yes, I'm serious) and a bunch of photographs.  Bear in mind the girl is  leaving to go back to Toronto next month   I said to my sister, you have got to be kidding me. I'm not taking all this crap. She's like why don't you empty out some of your other things to make room. To which I said IT'S CLOTHING THAT I NEED. To which she responded "Well can't you buy clothing there??"  Unreal.  Now I look like the bad guy. I'm taking the crap begrudgingly. Why the hell do I always say I'll do these things, thinking I'll be the  urlLink 5 O'Clock Hero ? I should know better by now.

      I finally have an answer to that question.  So apparently, I'm in the midst of Shimada and Hamamatsu. I'm going to be in a small town called Haibara. The girl who is hosting me during my training week says that there's a large settlement of Brazilians (although I'm puzzled as to whether they would be the  urlLink Japanese-Brazilians who migrated and are now returning to Japan , or Brazilian Brazilians) but at least I now have an address I can ship things to.  I'm teetering over the luggage weight limit for one of my suitcases. I think I'll be shipping my winter coat in addition to some food in my first surface care package.

         So last night I read the Moore article from Dad's copy of Time this week.   One question: what was with the endless comparisons between Moore and  urlLink faux-Aussie Mel Gibson ?  Fahrenheit 9/11 is *not* the Passion of the Christ. Repeat, Fahrenheit 9/11 is not the Passion of the Christ.  Jeez, apparently you can't make a controversial movie anymore without endless comparisons to  urlLink Gibson .

      Phase one of packing has begun. I managed to stretch out the task of packing my first suitcase into five hours or so by taking numerous breaks. It seems the only time I enjoy packing is when I'm using it as a procrastination activity to avoid other (more pressing) tasks.  The only three items I'm bringing in excess are anti-perspirant/deodorant (Degree seems to be one of the only big commercial brands that offers the combination of the two), which everyone has told me is a scarce--if non-existant--item in Japan. The next is toothpaste..O.K..so it's not that Japan doesn't have toothpaste with flouride available, but you have to look around more in order to score so I've thrown in four tubes to get me through. The last is tampons, whose scarcity in Asia I have no explanation for. But then come to think of it,  urlLink there's still much confusion about tampons when it comes to North America .        Naively, I choose to believe that if I put anything inside of a ziploc bag any liquid I pack will stay contained there if anything breaks. Call this the suburban housewife's logic but anything inside of a ziploc bag seems like it's providing an impenetrable barrier to me. Hopefully my work clothes won't be soaked in perfume to prove my theory horribly wrong when I open my suitcase on Wednesday.     So I think I followed  urlLink Air Canada 's baggage rules but the task of pushing the luggage onto our uncooperative dodgy family scale wasn't exactly an easy task (it's small and creaky; the suitcase is huge and heavy).  These aren't very interesting, but  urlLink here's the rest .

      Yes, it's true. Shopping is exhausting. I can hear you all cackling about that right now, but seriously, it is! Perhaps walking around in muggy 31 degree celsius weather didn't help.  Amy and Steve came up for the  urlLink Van Halen  concert Saturday night. No success getting rid of the two extra tickets, but after having talked to  urlLink Lisa  this happened to a friend of hers as well, so they're not alone.  I wish they'd stayed at my place instead of spending $169 on a hotel room though!  But you can't turn back time. I guess the bargains we found more than made up for that expenditure (hmm that's not faulty logic is it..spend more money to make up for spending too much money in the first place..why are we wired this way??).  urlLink H&M  at Fairview was something of a disappointment in terms of the sizing issue. A 32 inch belt couldn't even get around my waist. How depressing. We couldn't find anything larger than a size 8 in there for a lot of great items but that could be because they sold out of them. Was tempted to get a pretty summer halter dress for $9.90 but held back (how many dresses does one really need? I got that $19 prom dress at the  urlLink Sears Outlet  just last week). Amy got a bundle of hair ties for $2 and I got a cheap ass polyester belt, but Steve was the big shopper at this mall. He got a couple of shirts on his way to and from the BATHROOM!  At least I got my sister's birthday present out of the way. I got her a combination skin face system for $89 at  urlLink H20+ . Steve scored on some majorly discounted bath and body gift sets there for under $20 a piece, pleasing the saleswoman (haven't we bought enough?? Even if the other stuff is discounted by 30%??).  The sweetest plum was probably the  urlLink Roots  outlet on Orfus Road. I got a velour skirt for $4.99, a waffle weave boys top for my boss's son for $9 (I estimate his age at four although I can't be positive), a sun hat for $2.99, and a t-shirt for $9 for his two year old daughter.  Check out the weird ass "Whirlyball" arena on the strip of outlet stores though:     Whirlyball. It's the sport of the future!!  Amy scoped out some great things at the Stitches outlet believe it or not. $5 summer sweaters, $10  urlLink Maple Leafs  t-shirt. An incredible amount of neon  urlLink mesh  and "I'm a Hooker named Laverne" wear was spotted here. Does one * really * require a MESH cape slash poncho? You can't argue the warmth factor. You can't argue the style factor. Explain that one to me.  The Le Chateau outlet also had some wicked deals. Dress tops for $2.99, shoes for $15..on top of that there was a 25% discount off everything in the store. We managed to catch the last eight minutes of the sale. I kind of felt like my head was going to explode trying to find something without going overboard. I ended up settling on a $4 top. The frenzy-type music they played really got people worked up and scrambling to get in line before the discount stopped.  On top of all this we got two dozen doughnuts from one of the flagship  urlLink Krispy Kreme 's by my house. Thinking this would not suffice to make us morbidly obese on refined sugars (because you know, type two diabetes is good or something) we proceeded to have an early dinner at the Lone Star. I think I've been to Lone Stars a total of 300 times with Amy and Steve, and we never seem to tire of it. At the last minute they decided to get me some brownie/ice cream cake, which we proceeded to devour against our better judgement. Belt buckles were undone to accommodate.     After dodging lightning we made it back. It didn't feel like goodbye.  All full size pictures are  urlLink here

      I got lost with  urlLink the Magnetic Fields  last night. Herbal refreshments aside, it was a fantastic show. Stephin and Claudia had some witty banter going on in spite of Merritt's series of bad pun jokes (the church they played at was unbearably hot--what with no ceiling fans and stained glass windows that couldn't open and all--so he left in the middle of the set to fetch a portable fan to put onstage after which he said "Well we thought we'd have at least one fan onstage tonight").  Opener  urlLink Andrew Bird  was another standout. I was expecting to hear some cheesy local schmo, like the performer outside the church who was clutching a Jewish "Uncle Maury" type hat while he was barefoot and singing, but was pleasantly surprised by his amazing  urlLink Murray Torkildsen  type voice and talent on the violin.  The Fields are doing a completely different setlist tonight and  urlLink I'm tempted to go again  although I don't think I will, as I'm trying to conserve money my last week here.  Best: Smoke and Mirrors, All My Little Words, I Die  I completely forgot my digital camera, so there's nothing to post from the show..sorry about that :(..but here's a totally unrelated photo from an unrelated performance..

       urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  was very persuasive and compelling, but I have to admit that while you're watching it you can't help but feel as if many of the clips are *very* strategically cut. I hestiate to use the word manipulative here, but I suppose that's  urlLink Moore 's whole point.     I think  urlLink the overtone is pretty much what a lot of people are secretly thinking but not necessarily wanting to believe ..  While the piece is far from flawless, it does remind us of this:   It's all about the money, honey . And covering your ass to keep the money at all costs. But then, we all knew that already, right?  Here's Peter on our way to the theatre:     I'm going to also confess that I have something of a soft spot for Moore. He answered all my emails when I used his film  urlLink The Big One  back in 1997 for a high school World Issues project. He was very encouraging to me, asked me some questions about Ontario and was generally very sweet (maybe in the same way a cantankerous old uncle trying to sway you to their views might be).  I'm still disappointed the  urlLink Rainbow Theatre  matinees were completely sold out. I'm sorry about that guys, I didn't even think to call and/or buy tickets ahead of time, but duh..I guess all cheap people were flocking to the theatre downtown.  Fireworks are going to start soon. Time for me to fetch my earplugs...

       urlLink Amy  needs to get rid of a pair of Van Halen tickets. They're nosebleeds, for $100* a pop (* Note : very negotiable).  Sammy is back if that sweetens the pot.  You'd totally be helping her out..you can email me if you want to hook it up.
