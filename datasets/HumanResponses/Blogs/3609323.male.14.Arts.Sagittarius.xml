						   My friend Kim, one I have become close to in a very short period of time, is going through a hard time with her father. She has got a short temper with her father and the way he acts. He does not do his share of work around the house, instead he forces Kim to do it all. He takes cable away from her, and does not let her do anything on her own. Her parents are isolating her into a frenzy of loneliness, and the recent outburst almost made her cry. This happened right before I called her, and I had to keep her from crying because I would start crying too. Kim went outside to tell her father she was fed up with him not doing anything, and she would not take his crap anymore. After calling her a bitch multiple times, Kim was dragged by her hair, and thrown into her room, which she says: "Was not very comfortable!" Her hands are tied, because if she calls the police and reports it, she will be forced into relocation, and will never be able to see her friends again. (Dont worry, i have read the whole thing to her, and she approves) DIE KIM'S FATHER, NOW!!!!!

						   Today, I went to her (You should know who I'm talking about when i say "her" by now) house and had a good time (Not in that way). But we had lots of fun until she got mad at me. I think I came on too strongly, and she forbade me from making any contact with her, which is very unlike her, who normally loves to be hugged and held and loved on and stuff like that. So i was mopey for the rest of the time, but then when we all came back (Me, Liz, Trevor, and Her) to my house, it all got better again. But soon paradise was fading again, for Trevor's dad came and was mad at him. Trevor was supposed to spend the night, but it was cancelled because his dad wished to speak to him in private, at that  exact  moment in time, it was crappy ("Her" and Liz went home already).

						   I was going to my new classes, and found my old friend Trevor sitting in the row next to me. It had been a little while since we had seen each other, so we had to catch up with each other a little bit. We really didnt pay attention in class, instead we talked to each other. When we got our assignment to do, I decided to join trevor's little group of friends and do my work. This is the beginning of my uhhh ..... corruption. We focused on talking more than our work, something that i have rarely done, and I met all of Trevor's new friends: Liz and *NOT TO BE NAMED*. I soon began to like *NOT TO BE NAMED*, and once I got to know her, the attraction became more and more noticable. I began to think about her all the time, and I can barely keep her out of my head. This hell that I have dug myself into is good yet bad. I have grown closer to her than anybody I have ever known in my life. This is a bad thing because I dont want to get hurt along the way, I have a bad feeling that this is a Romeo and Juliet story that will end in tragedy.
