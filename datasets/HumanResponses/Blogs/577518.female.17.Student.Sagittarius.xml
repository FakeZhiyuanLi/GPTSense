       Now everything is back to normal.    Just like what they told me, form 6 is really different. We need to study by ourselves, teachers are there just to guide us, not command us to do homeworks or revisions. Everything is like a dream, I never expect I can be this far, I thought I will never grow up to achieve anything I dream. It takes 2 years to step in to the university. It takes extra efforts to make a goal, I told myself, I need to be patient, I must work hard and enjoy my form 6. Just call me  kiasu  or anything, I don't care, my goal is 'enter the U'. To those who always look down at and think I'm a loser, I don't care, you go your own way.   Teo get the JPA scholarship, he went to UTM on Tuesday. I will miss him very much! Lee  went to MMU few weeks ago, having fun with his university life earlier than anyone of us and meanwhile try to woo a cute girl in his class. I have no idea how to help him, just hope that this couple will live happily ever after ;)

      And, why am I complaining here? I fed up with my geocities homepage, because I keep on editing the wrong code, and I crack my brain for the background colors, I'm too much. I should let them in the same color.  Blur blur blur blue.

                     urlLink The 100 yen shop  is almost like our RM2 shop in Malaysia. But their shop looks bigger and far more interesting. They sell toys, food, drinks, towel, cartoon bowl and a lot more. If only I can go there, I will shop like a mad cat, because 100 yen is almost RM3.60, so that's cheap and we can hardly find any cheap thing in Japan.  urlLink Yani always drop by at the 100 yen shop with her kids  and her kids really enjoying their time there with those  kawaii  toys. Serena loves 100 yen shop! Wonder whether those RM2 shop will update themselves and sell things like that?

      Don't know why, I have too many annoying people around me. I consider them as my friends, but how about them? It's ok if they absent in my life, I don't need these kinda people to ruin my life. Go away go away, I don't want a  polluted friendship .  My eyes hurt and I can't breathe because of the haze. Ah, this is terrible, I need fresh air, please!   I forgot to thank my friends for helping me last week in the MUET tuition class. I vomited at the class, and they helped me to clean the disgusting  stuff . Here's the list: thanks to Kah Boon, Li Min, Siew Peng, Lit Yee, Shue Ling and Nian Tze. You guys let me know that I am not alone. And to my MUET tuition teacher, mdm Ho, sorry for interrupting the class,  I wanted run to the toilet, but I couldn't make it, I just cannot control myself.   I'm better now, just need to eat less, cuz I will vomit if I'm  overload .   Still need to finish a lot of homework, but I enjoy it. Going to math. tuition later, that's all for today ;)

       HAPPY FATHER'S DAY to all cool daddy out there  :) Drive my mom to market this morning, a bit nervous actually, hehe. My mom sat next to me and looks really calm, that's cool. Then my mom's father, who is my grandpa phoned to told us he will visit to our house later. That's a big surprise actually.   Grandpa just came back from his vacation to China, then he just drop by our house to chat with mom and ask my aunts to come here too. I can't tell you how  kecoh   they were.   And my annoying cousin was here. My mom cook a bowl of delicious mee for her because she was hungry, er, so jealous, hey, that's my mom. Then my mom washed the dishes for her, such a lazy fella (annoying)! Then she came in to my room while I was busy doing my homeworks. Then she sat on my bed, her mom came in, looked at my room and began to criticise about my small little room. "My daughter's room is much bigger than yours, you know?", then my annoying cousin said, "yaloh, my room is much bigger than this." Then her mom said, "You have everything bigger and better than her", oh, she said that in front of me. Then annoying bitch said, "ya, agree. But my body is much smaller than her, so there's the only thing I have which smaller than her". Then both of them laugh and laugh non stop, they thought that's a good joke. Ok, now you shut up, you idiot. I stayed as cool as possible and I was ignoring them. That's still not over yet, her mom went in to the kitchen and told my mom about this not-funny-joke.   Then she sat on my bed again, looking at me, I ignored her till the end. Realising that I didn't talk to her, so she started to stand up and I thought she will left. But no, she began to touch my things. She touched my doll, my comics, my books and other things. Then she took one of my Crayon Sinchan comic out of my room, arg.   Now, I want to tell you, I LOVE MY ROOM VERY MUCH AND I DON'T CARE HOW FAT I AM, THAT'S ME!  When I first moved to my new house, I choose this small room because I love it. I feel unsafe in a big room and a small room makes me feel very warm. I have my own space in this small room. I hide in a small space between my bed and the wall when I was sad and I feel really really safe. That's my room, my privacy.

      Finally, I have  my first driving license ! I passed the driving test last week, and I was a happy-happy kid for the whole week. Yeah, never give up and try and try again no matter what. so after the 4th attempt, I passed the driving test in just 5 minutes. Yippee! ^__^  Busy! Too many homeworks to finish, espeacially math. homework which never come to the end. Ah, I try my best to finish the homework. My friends in science class are really suffer from the sciences subject in English version, good luck people! But then, I'm not better then them, I'm still struggle to understand those complicated math. and some concepts on the business and economics. Life's like that!  P/s: Miss you so much, tomoko. I received your mail 2 weeks ago when the pejabat pos phoned my house to ask me take the mail from them. Actually it was all the postman fault, because he didn't leave the card in the mailbox when he's here and I was not at home. >.

      Lee told me about his problems with that girl, cuz he really not sure whether the girl is falling for him or just treat him as her brother. I told him everything will be fine. if the girl doesn't like you, then forget about her, just be her friend then find another nice girl. That's my theory for love. But this guy just can't let go his feeling for that girl, poor Lee. Wish Lee good luck...

      About my driving test, I pass on the road part and failed the parking section. Well, it's ok, I will try again next week.   Try to finish all the homework by this week, decided to study next week.   Durian season is here, aunt bought 10kg of durians and the smell is everywhere. I spray the perfume everywhere in my room and it's still like those durians are in my room.   Want to blog more, but my brain is blank...   By the way, happy birthday to Yang di-Pertuan Agong! :)

      A little bit moody right now, just like the weather outside. You know you won't feel happy if you will take the stupid driving test for the third time tomorrow. You know you won't tell everyone around you that you are so clumsy and you failed your driving test twice and you were crying under your bed like a baby girl. Ah, what if I failed the test again? Touch wood, touch wood!   :(

       Ah, it's another week! Look back on what I have done during these pass 5 days, the conclusion is: I was as lazy as usual. Just one more week, my first exam will come, gosh, I hope I can manage to do some revision before the exam. Yeah, I'm turning to be a  kiasu  girl!      Kinda frustrated about myself. I think I'm too proud and selfish sometimes. Just like few days ago, we were required to write down few points for the MUET speaking question in 30 minutes, and I couldn't think of one point to support my idea. I thought I was good in this kind of thing, but as a result, I'm not! I'm still need to improve myself, I can't stop right now...      That's all, still have tonnes of homework to finish, tata.

        My teacher, Bio Lee     Went to my old school annual dinner with my mom yesterday. Saw my teachers and had a chance to talk with my Biology and Math&nbsp;teacher, Bio Lee. I used to hate her and never finished her homework. If she's not the one who kept on telling me how bad I was in my Add. Math, I wouldn't improve.&nbsp;I&nbsp;tried and I failed a lot of times.&nbsp;For the SPM, I got 3B for Add.&nbsp;Math, I know, as long as I try, I can achieve what I want. Now, I thank her.     &nbsp;   I told her about my current school,&nbsp;complaining about those teachers who are so sarcastic. She said nevermine,&nbsp;I need to work hard by myself in Form 6 and don't expect anything from the teachers.&nbsp;Haha, she knew&nbsp;my&nbsp;Math. teacher when I&nbsp;mentioned his name, because I was complaining about&nbsp;this boring teacher.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   She&nbsp;was so friendly, I miss her!     &nbsp;    The annual dinner &nbsp;    That dinner was held at my school hall. That's a big new&nbsp;hall, I'm amazed. When I stepped in to that school, everything came back. My memories with my friends and teachers; those delicious food from the canteen... How I wish that I can still be a part of this school.     &nbsp;   All the best, NDC!     &nbsp;    My current school     It's good to have a blog because you can grumble about anything and rate the world with your eyes. About that sarcastic MUET teacher who think that she is so smart, I hate her. She always talk like as if she is the greatest and smartest&nbsp;teacher on earth. She teach&nbsp;with a soft voice, and read everything line by line from the textbook. For those who couldn't hear her, they started to&nbsp;make noise, including me. Then she was unhappy.&nbsp;10 minutes before she&nbsp;left the class, she started to complain about us.&nbsp;She talked in the high volume, complain about our&nbsp;grammar, our attitude, plus, she reminded us that if we are not happy about her, we can go talk to the headmaster and see who will win.     &nbsp;   Hey, you should look at the mirror before you talk, see what reflected in you mirror, is there an angel or a devil. I was totally pissed off with this kind of teacher.&nbsp;Tell me I'm rude, shut up!     &nbsp;    People who I like to thank in this week     Haha, that's a new section of my blog. Well, first of all, I would like to thank my God for keeping me alive. Then I want to thank my parents for everything and my grandma too, of course, thank you for your love. Then&nbsp;my classmates who being so friendly to me, thank you. Then Mei Shan who gave me a great book since she knew I love reading and buy a lot of books, thank you! Then thanks to Malaysia for the peaceful enviroment and thanks to Datuk Seri Abdullah Badawi who amazed me with his interview on BBC.     &nbsp;   Thank You!     &nbsp;   Peace!     &nbsp;

        Ne  w stuff   from    B    l  og  ger  !&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Well, everything is going fine today. Working on my assignment about child abuse, nearly finished it, and then I can finish all my homework by today. Ya,&nbsp;I will  burn the midnight oil  to do all my homework, so that I can have more time to study. Exam is coming soon, need to work hard. Economics tuition teacher told us 'we won't know how smart we are, until we finally sit down to study'. Ya, that's really true. Form six life is all about the STPM examination; good result =&nbsp;IPTA. Of&nbsp;course, I learned a lot of new things in form six, especially things about Business and Economics. Both subjects are interesting!   I love form six!      &nbsp;  Actually I want to share my MUET assignment with other STPM or SPM students out there(if only there's people out there who read my blog anyway). I&nbsp;think sharing is the&nbsp;greatest art in life. We give and take and give and take. This routine run over and over again,&nbsp;then human beings interact with each other, they share the information and after a few routine of this, they begin to share their happiness and laughter together. That's really touching, isn't it?    Ah, I'm seriously don't know what the hell I'm talking about, blah blah blah...

P always jeolous if I'm better than her and always pretended that she's stupid than me; but Mei Shan willing to share anything with me, she's such a good classmate! Thank God! Oh, I love the picture from the quiz (below). Feel so calm when looking at it, and it's very match with this green layout. Ah, I'm tired. Need to study right now, tata~

      Came back from Tesco. Met my friends there and had our lunch in Secret Recipe. Aw, the food there is very very expensive. I spent about RM17.45, included 15% tax. But the food is quite nice.   Maked a lip-balm for Jasmine, everyone was surprise that I can make this kind of thing, hehe, thanks to  urlLink Tomoko .  Refer to the last post, about a friend of mind who hates the gardening, now I really feel like want to give her a punch. Well, when we were eating, my friend want to lend me her spoon for my Fish n chips, but then her spoon was full with meet, so I didn't use her spoon. Then that girl suggest them to buy me a tudung on my birthday, because I don't have meat in my meal. Ah, she is such a unwisdom girl. She talked like a standard one student.   Ah, forget about it.

      There's a girl who gave me a very bad impression about herself.   Yesterday, we planned to join the Natural Loving Club after school. But then I have my tuition on 12.30, so I couldn't go to the AGM. Then she told me she didn't want to go too, because if she join the club, she need to join those members to plant the flowers in school, she said she hate it. You should see the way she said : I hate it the most. You would feel like want to give her a punch.   Hmm, so she hates nature. I always think that if someone hates nature, they don't deserve to live on this Earth.  They breathe the air and they step on the ground, then they hate the nature?

      Just came back from my Economics tuition, wow, now I have four tuition in five days, from Monday to Friday. Well, the tutor from the Economics class is quite funny. He told us about life and  ejek  us a bit, that's remind me about my BM tuition teacher, Mr. Oh. Will send him a e-card later, wonder how is he right now.    urlLink Jasmine  will go to KL in another two weeks because she is offered to be an educationalist(a teacher, I mean). So, she will go to KL for the training for one and a half year, then continue her study in university. We going to have a farewell party for her in Secret Recipe on this Sunday. Goodbye Jasmine, *sob sob*...  There's a Canteen's day in my school next week. And we are forced to order the food from the school. Since I step in to the school, I never eat anything from the canteen. I'm not anti the canteen actually, just too lazy to walk all the way from my classroom to the canteen and squeeze with the students. I prefer stand outside my class and eat my bread with my friends. Now, that's what we call as 'anti-social'. Oh, and I found these two site  urlLink anti-social dot net  and  urlLink anti-social dot org . Waiting for them to update their sites.

      Log in to the chatroom, cuz I feel like want to voice out something, but then, I was totally speechless. For the first time, I'm emotionless.  I feel blue in this sunny day, when everything outside is bright and I'm blue inside. Somewhere deep down my heart know that I'm not that happy in these few days, but I don't know why? Maybe I'm still can't get used to the enviroment in my new school. I miss my old school, those friendly teachers and the canteen.  Ah, I miss everyone...  *Hugs*

Why can't everyone have a happy life? Why some people need to suffer? And some people deserve beautiful life? Is this some kind of discrimination?
