       urlLink     As I eluded to earlier, our backyard is a very interesting if not strange place. With two rabbits, two ducks and a dog there is never a dull moment. The rabbit in the picture above is Scrappy. Believe it or not, Scrappy is the dominant animal of our backyard. Tuff, our Border Terrier, has quickly learned to stay clear of Scrappy. So much for rabbits being timid creatures. On the 4th of July there were fireworks in the little wadding pool inhabited by our web footed friends. This is when we learned that Timon, the Mallard duck, is actually a male. We were right about Rajah, the Peking duck, being a female. All I can say is that it was very noisy and wet. I can honestly say that I get more entertainment in one evening in our backyard than I get from an entire week of television.

       urlLink     Over the past two years my family and I have had many opportunities to explore Utah and Arizona. I am now totally obsessed with this region of the country. The rugged, contrasting landscape is perfect for an amateur photographer such as myself. During one of our many trips I drove past an amazing reflecting pond as we made our way down highway 89 in southern Utah. To my family's dismay I made a u-turn and headed back to photograph the scenic pond. Unexpected pleasures such as this make Utah a great place to visit.

       urlLink      During the past month our family was very lucky to find and adopt a Border Terrier.  Tuff came to us from Scotland, via a breeder in Montana.  We weren't even familiar with the breed until Megan and Kyle visited the puppyfind.com website in search of a breed of dog that would be compatible with our home environment.  I say home environment because we have a small house with a decent sized backyard.  The backyard was already home to two rabbits (both male) and two ducks (one male, one female).  I'm sure I could post a few interesting stories about the ducks.  Another important factor in choosing a breed was whether or not Kyle agreed to be seen walking the dog in public.  No foo-foo dogs for Kyle.  After three long weeks of waiting Tuff arrived at SFO on the first of July.  It was love at first sight.

      I just don't get all of the hype over Michael Moore. I have heard enough about his latest "movie", Fahrenheit 9/11, to know that I do not wish to support him by plunking down $9 to see it. I have talked to a few people who have seen Fahrenheit 9/11 and have accepted it as fact. I have suggested to these people that they do a little research and come to their own conclusions. A good start would be the 911 Commission Report which is free and is available on the internet. Perhaps I will purchase a ticket for another movie and instead watch Fahrenheit 9/11.
