       If you're into cars you'll love the Mercedes-Benz F400 Carving. I was looking through some old car magazines and wow! the wheels till for better turning. Wonder what it'd cost for one of those things. the sides are very similar to the sides of the soon to come Mercedes-Benz McLaren SLR mix. you can see where they came from, but in this awesome concept car, there are so many features, actually, just read the whole article. (for those who are new at blogger the headers are linked)

       Well, moving on from the FIRST competition, we move on to segways!! Both corperations started by the same very brilliant man, Dean Kamen. However, if you don't like the segway, then here's a page you will like:  urlLink How to render the segway obsolete . Now, I personally think having a two wheeled battlebot is not the most clever of things. I think that it's just a waste of time. It says self balancing in the article, I mean, do you want something that is "balancing" to go around trying to harm thing that don't "balance". Come on, even a jeep can ru over these things and crush them! ...and for those of you that like to play video games, you can tell a jeep is not the hardest thing to blow up. Look at the picture! It looks like the back tire of a pickup truck! Well, if you have objections, please be my guest and leave a comment or urlLink email  me and I'll just post you're email and your username or nick name or whatever.

       First of all since I have competed in the FIRST Robotics competition, and need to start posting information and ideas, I thought of where to start and figured why not make it something that would repeate its self, so kind of mix to posts, but anyways, FIRST Robotics was a very very fun competition to both attend and compete in. There is Robotics involved, but not only that, it opens many, many doors for you in the future. Universities from Purdue to ITT Tech give scholarships which total to $3.8 million!!! That means there are more scholarships than there are people applying for them! Not only that but there are a few other parts in the competition! Maketing,3d modeling & animation, web design & graphic arts , and then of course the actual engineering side. Now, I don't want to bore you, so then the last thing I would like to say is, that there are many different awards that you can win and three of those awards, cna take you to Nationals! They range from the Chairman Award (the competition winner) to the Rookie All-Star (the best Rookie, which my team,  urlLink The International House Of Technology , won during the 2004 season) to the best website etc.
