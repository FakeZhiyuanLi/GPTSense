      hey everyone!!! i just found out that apprentice is by NBC not CBS...then why the hell am i so attracted to it??? i guess i know who is working the miracles now...its Mark Burnett. whateva!!! anyway i still luv it ...and will continue to support CBS cause it made survior...thats how i found Darrah and got my wonderful name that i would have never guessed of even discovering ...(p.s. Mark Burnett produced survivor too) just finished pracise on the piano...so tiring ...really drains you even though you r just sitting there moving your fingers.its really frustrating when you can't get ur fingers to run and stuff like forgetting key signature and most of the time stumbling in the middle of the piece...i could never ever go to the exam this way...sure to fail...gosh!!! i'm so ..ireally don't know what to do.guess i'll just have to try my best.today i'm in luv with avril's : my happy endind:Let's talk this overIt's not like we're deadWas it something I did?Was it something You said......You were everything, everything that I wantedWe were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost itAnd all of the memories, so close to me, just fade awayAll this time you were pretendingSo much for my happy endingOh oh, oh oh, oh oh... singing is contagious..anyway gtg to practise again...bb and god bless

      its sunday...dreadful one...the whole house is chaotic once again...practising for piano exam next week. i find the more i practise the stiffer my fingers get..they b come like fat bananas and can't run...what a waste, that i got sick on that week..because of that i had to postpone the exam and lack of practise for just one week makes so much difference...well i'm looking forward to survivor -vanuatu starting in september...now i find the amazing race quite boring but i'll still continue watching it for the sake of supporting CBS...though it is not produced by mark burnett...produced by some other guy...guess i've gtg practise again...smiles and hugs from the mudpig!!!since i'm getting baptised i should practise saying this as James had instructed me to do...god bless and take care>>>haha
