      After the excitement of the last week with my birthday celebrations, this weekend seemed very quiet and boring!&nbsp; Lack of money also helped in keeping us indoors.   Friday night,&nbsp;after dinner in the garden, we drove to Henley on Thames for a stroll by the river.&nbsp; It was quite a warm evening and there were quite a few people around and boats moored up.&nbsp;&nbsp;At one of the impressive houses on the little island in the river someone was having a "garden party" with a jazz band playing under the gazebo.&nbsp; How the other half live!   Saturday was filled up by washing, a trip into town to stock up&nbsp;on Dan's supplies for the long walk followed by a bike ride west along the  urlLink Kennet and Avon Canal .      Having a rest by a lock      Dan standing on one of the big locks along the canal   After dinner in the garden we resumed our "slobbing" position on the sofas in front of a dismal Saturday night TV.   Sunday was another thrilling day of chores!&nbsp; Another trip into town for more supplies for Dan (things he forgot the first time round), a trip to Tescos for our weekly shop followed by a blitz of the upstairs rooms in the house.   And now it's late and the only thing left to look forward to is Monday morning, back to work with a full week ahead!&nbsp; :o(   Still it's pay day on Wednesday!&nbsp; :o)   L x

      I was given a book called,  urlLink 1000 places to see before you die  as a birthday present from my friend Gareth.  &nbsp;  I've only briefly flicked through the book so far but for a travel loving girl like me it's going to be a fantastic read!  &nbsp;  The book features places all over the world and during my quick flick I've already found that I've visited some of the places already (including  urlLink Oahu ,  urlLink Table Mountain ,  urlLink The Ritz Hotel ,  urlLink The Eiffel Tower ,  urlLink Delos  &amp;  urlLink Mykonos ,  urlLink Gubbio &nbsp;and  urlLink Windsor Castle )  &nbsp;  I sure hope I manage to see at least half of them in my lifetime!&nbsp; Our American Adventure next year should cross a few of these off ( urlLink The Bellagio ,  urlLink The Pacific Coast Highway  and  urlLink Yosemite National Park  to name a few)  &nbsp;  Thanks Gareth, I love it!&nbsp; :o)  &nbsp;  Another cool present I got was a  urlLink Portable Voodoo  book from Skene &amp; Jo.&nbsp; It comes complete with a voodoo doll, "magical spell pins" and some voodoo spells.&nbsp; So you had better watch out, upset me and I might just stick a pin in you!&nbsp; ;o)  &nbsp;  L x

      For some crazy reason (unknown to me), in August this year, Dan has decided to leave me at home and walk 130 miles over 8 days! Mad fool!  He has decided to do some good for mankind and has agreed to do the walk in order to raise some money for charity.   His chosen charity is the MS Society as his younger brother was diagnosed as having MS in December 2002.  Anyway, Dan explains it better than me so I ask that you click  urlLink here  to find out all about it and maybe even sponsor him some money?! :o)   Thanks!  L x

      Yesterday, myself,  urlLink Dan ,  urlLink Skene ,  urlLink Johnson  and  urlLink Vix  had an enjoyable day at the races in  urlLink Newbury .   The weather was nice and sunny and we sat on the grass with a picnic from our posh new picnic basket and drank some fizzy stuff while we placed a few bets.   Vix had asked her Daddy for a few tips and while they didn't always pay off she was in fact the only one of us who managed to at least break even.  The rest of us all had lighter wallets.  Johnson did manage to correctly pick a winner but didn't actually place a bet!  D'oh!   After the racing was over, we wandered into the fair town of Newbury for a few drinks before we went off in search of food.  Being a racing day everywhere was full but we eventually found space at Pizza Express.   Opting to have one last drink before heading back we missed the last train home at 10.25pm and faced the prospect of having to pay Â£50 for a taxi but in the end Vix managed to sweet talk a friend of hers into come and picking us up.  What a hero! (and fool if you ask me!)   L x

      Well, I made it to London on time and I'm glad to say that my hair and makeup turned out fine in the end!   I met Dan at Paddington station just before 4.30pm (after being harassed by a stinky drunken tramp who wanted to squash on the seat next to me then pushed me aside when I stood up).&nbsp; My first clue to the location of my surprise was that we would be going to Green Park station. The only place I knew where that was the nearest stations was Hard Rock Cafe but I was told it wasn't there ;o)   We started off with a pint of Stella and a G&amp;T in the Reef bar to discuss the plan for the evening and eventually decided to head off towards Covent Garden.&nbsp; After a wander round and a glass of red wine it was time for the mystery location to be revealed.   We arrived at Green Park tube station and I saw a sign above the exit which give the game away. My birthday surprise was... Dinner at  urlLink The Ritz !   With an hour before our dinner reservation we went for a drink in  urlLink The Rivoli Bar . I ordered one of their famous "Pre-Dinner Cocktails", a Ritz Medley and Dan went for a Mojito.   Soon it was time for dinner in  urlLink The Restaurant  which was a fantastically stunning room.   After placing our orders we were firstly greeted by a waiter with the bread trolley on which was a basket of about 6-7 different types of bread. Bewildered and confused by all the types I stuck to the white ciabatta which was sliced in front of me and then served from a silver dish while Dan decided on the tomato and olive bread.   Next came what seemed to be an expresso but in fact was an appetizer with compliments of the chef. It was a kind of fish soup which I thought wasn't too bad (not being a lover of fish) and Dan thought was very good.   Our starters were served, mine complete with a silver dome cover! I chose the Duck served with broad beans and peas while Dan opted for the Smoked Salmon served with herb blini and creme fraiche. The half of lemon was wrapped in muslin and tied with a yellow ribbon so you didn't get any pips or anything in your dinner!   For our main meal I had Lamb Cutlets while Dan had the Sirloin Steak. Both were served with chunky chips and green beans and both were absolutely gorgeous. The meal was washed down with a very nice bottle of South African Cabernet-Sauvignon.   We couldn't refuse the desserts which were as fabulous as everything else. We both went for one from the chocolate section. Mine was a chocolate and caramel creation while Dan had a   chocolate fondant with raspberry ripple ice cream. Divine!   It was an absolutely fabulous night and if your credit card can survive the damage then I'd recommend everyone to go. We're already starting a collection to go again! ;o)   Thanks to Dan for arranging it for me, it's the best birthday surprise ever and I love you lots!   L xx

      Why is it when you want things to go right, they don't!  ?   It's 2.30pm and I'm hoping to catch the 3.30pm train to London for my birthday surprise. My nice new posh clothes are already to be put on but disaster has struck!    My hair hasn't gone exactly to plan but that's the least of my worries.     My face has decide for some unknown reason as it's never happened before, to come out in red blotches and it feels very itchy. I've already took off the first lot of make up because it look hideous and the 2nd attempt isn't much better. On top of that, because I'm starting to flap around I'm getting hot so the bits that aren't blotchy are becoming red!    Why does it always happen when you want to look nice? If I was going to work then my hair and make-up would have decide to go on perfectly.    Bloody typical!   Anyway, I must get on.   I'm starting to get excited now.  Check back later to find out where I went!  :o)     L xx

      Yeah! Today is my birthday and I've decided to take the day off and indulge myself in shopping and beauty treatments!  Bliss!  This afternoon I will be venturing into London for my birthday surprise with Dan.  I don't know what it is yet but I'm very excited!  All I know is it's a very posh meal somewhere in London.  I'll let you know all about it tomorrow.  The Birthday Girl xxx

      Just been to see  urlLink The Stepford Wives .  I did think it was going to be a "chick flick", which is not a bad thing saying as I love chick flicks, but I have to say I think guys would like it too.  Nicola Kidman looked a bit weird in it though, not quite sure why.  Maybe it was the short dark hair and she was a bit too skinny in it too.  Looked all long and lanky!  Everyone should go and see it  :o)   L x  Oh and there's a cool twist at the end...

      I'm all alone, Dan has left me!  :o(  Dan is off on his  urlLink long walk  this week so I'm home alone.  The house is very quiet and there's nothing much on the telly so I'm bored!  I must be bored becuase tonight I'm off to the  urlLink gym !  Well, when I say gym that is technically where I'm going but maybes not for the right reasons. I have a sunbed booked.  I am wondering if I should go in the gym, for a bit at least, or maybes just for a swim (or even a jaquzzi, steam and sauna)  I'm off to the  urlLink flicks  tomorrow night with Laura to see  urlLink The Stepford Wives  and then I've got 2 days off work to go down to Cornwall and meet the walkers so there's just tonight I need occupied.

      My Mam and Dad came to visit me this weekend.  After a long debate as to what to do on Saturday, we finally decided to take a trip into  urlLink London .  My Dad wanted to go to the  urlLink Tower Bridge Exhibition  while me and my Mam went for some retail therapy.   urlLink Notting Hill  is one of my favorite films and I've always wanted to go to look round the sights used in the film so first stop for us a trip to  urlLink Portobello Road Market .   Many of the buildings and shops used in the film have changed now and are barely recogniseable.   I did however manage to find the famous  urlLink blue door  (which isn't actually blue now) and the shop where William bumps into Anna (and spills orange down her) which has now become a coffee republic!  Pictures coming soon...  L x

      Last night myself, Dan, Ron, Jo & Skene went to the  urlLink The Great British Beer Festival  at  urlLink London Olympia  in Kensington.  I've never been to the Olympia before and was amazed to see it was so big inside, and full of beers!  I set Dan a little challenge whereby he had to drink a beer from each of our home counties. They had beers from both his nearest brewery in  urlLink Southwell  and my local brewery in  urlLink Jarrow ! I was very impressed when I saw that one on the list! The challenge went well and he didn't actually hate any of the beers :o) I didn't do as well with my choice of cider. I did try a Perry though and it was actually my favorite one of the night.  It was a good night and I'm now a big fan of beer festivals (for the cider of course!)  L x

        Whislt mouching around I stumbled across  urlLink JK Rowling's  website which to a Harry Potter fan like myself is quite interesting.  Having not finished reading Book 5,  urlLink The Order of the Phoenix , I felt I had to be careful what I was clicking on in case I spoilt the plot!  The 6th book, which is called "The Truth", has no release date as yet.  I have however discovered that the film of The Order of the Phonenix won't be out until June 2007 which has just scared me to realise that I'll be a 30 year old woman (almost) when it comes out!

      Wow!  A whole weekend of sunshine!  Could it really be summer?  On saturday we had a bbq which involved lots of eating and drinking. My cool 70's style punch bowl made is debut apperance and was filled with my own special Sangria (made with dregs of alcohol we had left over) It tasted fab and looked fantastic! :o)      Me and my supa dupa punch bowl filled with yummy Sangria      Ron drinks a pint of punch      Dan likes his new hat  The night was finished with a trip to  urlLink The After Dark Club , somewhere I don't normally go but was lurred by their 80's night and have to admit, even though it's a manky club, the music was good and I had a great time dancing.  Sunday started with a clean up session which didn't actually take too long (thank god for dishwashers) There was a quick trip into town for some Hagan Dazs ice cream, banoffee and strawberry cheesecake to be precise and to purchase some  urlLink walkie-talkies  for  urlLink Dan's walk .  The rest of the day was spent sitting around the garden relaxing and reading my Harry Potter book.  Is amazing how much difference the sun makes!  :o)  L x
