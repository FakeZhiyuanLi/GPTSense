       I was looking through the contents of our bookshelf today, it’s in quite a sad state, not least because it’s not a shelf at all, it just appears to be a pile of books on a pair of window sills either side of the patio door. It has the usual combination of fiction, such as Harry Potter, mixed with the boring, examples of which include Lawrence Freedman’s Evolution of Nuclear Strategy and the National Rail Timetable, complete with folding map. I even have a 1970’s book on photography with some very retro 1970’s nakedness, but what really got my attention was the handful of self help books with interesting titles like “How to cope with stress” and better still, “the missus” has a copy of “how to cope with difficult people”, how telling !  I just had a quick look on the Amazon website at the self help section, it’s huge, and there are books on building self confidence, books on coping with change, and books on how positive thought will make you get richer, it’s all crazy, I don’t understand what the fascination is with it all, infact I find it all rather confusing, which makes me wonder if I there could be a market for self help books for people who have overdosed on self help. Perhaps Alan Carr, the undisputed master of the self help quit smoking book, can be persuaded to write “an easy way to quit self help” book.  Thomas Harris, who is apparently an expert on this crap, once wrote a book titled, “I’m Ok-You’re OK” it sold fifteen million copies, and is apparently meant to make us understand ourselves better. To be honest Tommy, I’m surprised you managed to even get it published with a title like that, I mean, what’s the point of telling someone everything is alright? If you want to be a success in the self help genre, you need titles like “I’m Ok-You’re a right bloody state” or, “Be nicer to people or they will stab you with needles” you need names to shock people. It’s exactly the same with all these diet books, you have the South Beach Diet, the GI Diet, and of course the Atkins Diet, but titles like that wont shock people into buying them, you need titles like “lose some weight you tubby bastard” and the follow up “lose some weight you tubby bastard – or you’ll die” because it’s only when people discover the true horror of their situation, that they will do anything to change it.  I’m sure we all fancy ourselves as amateur psychologists, maybe that’s why we are so obsessed about understanding how we feel, well I can tell you one thing about psychology, some of it isn’t meant to be understood, a lot of what we do is subconscious, a lot is instinct, and a lot of things have no logical explanation, I know because I did it at A-level, which I feel makes me eminently qualified to discuss the matter in print, and I couldn’t understand most of it, certainly I thought the rats in boxes experiment would have been more fun had we been allowed to administer electro-convulsive therapy.  As I get older, I start to realise that some people are just not happy unless they have a problem, people actually enjoy it, and they probably think about new problems to have, you can imagine the chain of thought that goes through someone’s head, having solved one problem, they have to find another one, they are unable to accept that there is actually nothing wrong with themselves.  I have visions of someone at home one day ordering the self help book to help them stop smoking, after a while, the book works and they are smoke free, but now a new problem occurs, they have put on weight, so they need to get the self help diet book, well that goes down a treat, the cigarettes have gone and so has the weight, but now they feel empty, they have nothing to do so they get a copy of the self help book for coping with change and it goes on and on. It’s a shame, because I fear that people have become so dependant upon others for leadership, and sometimes that leadership comes only from the pages of a book, that they may have actually forgot that they are in control, Alan Carr may have helped you quit smoking, but you made the decision, you had the willpower, you did the hard work.   The self help genre is big business, but it doesn’t need to be, if people could realise that they were in control of their own lives, and that they didn’t need a book to guide them, then we will have succeeded in keeping our individuality, because right now, we run the risk of becoming spoon fed self help junkies, looking for a quick fix of Thomas Harris or John Gray before we go to work, I can see the unemployed nicking car stereos to fund their Atkins habit or students smuggling self help audio books out of libraries in their underwear.  I am going to propose that Mr. Blair brings a motion in the commons, outlawing all self help books, and in their place, I suggest that we encourage people to just deal with their problems without the aid of a book. For example, if you are having relationship problems with someone, talk to them about it, don’t read a book, a book won’t save your marriage, although with some marriages, I can imagine that a book may be slightly more exciting. I think that half the problem with self help books, is that people can get reliant upon them, people actually believe that in some way, this book is going to change their life, it doesn’t occur to them that they have the power to make those changes on their own, because ultimately, when the time is right, they know what they want to do, and they discover they way to go about it.  Finally, if you are a self help addict, please try to kick the habit, I know it’s hard, but remember that the reason you took to self help is so that you weren’t dependant upon anything in the first place, rest assured, you will get over it, it takes time but we have had some success, Winona for example was so gutted after Boyzone split, she became addicted, and had to shoplift to fund her habit, it’s no different to what could happen to you if you don’t pack it in, so please, for me and the tidiness of my book shelf, lets get rid of self help.
