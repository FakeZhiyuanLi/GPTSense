      Not alot has happened. I've been working lately and just sleeping. So again, I'm just posting lyrics I find to be genius.   That day, that day What a mess what a marvel I walked into that cloud again And I lost myself And I'm sad, sad, sad Small, alone, scared Craving purity A fragile mind and A gentle spirit That day, that day What a marvellous mess This is all that I can do I'm done to be me Sad, scared, small, alone, beautiful It's supposed to be like this I accept everything It's supposed to be like this  That day, that day I lay down beside myself In this feeling of pain, sadness Scared, small, climbing, crawling Towards the light And it's all I see and I'm tired and I'm right And I'm wrong And it's beautiful  That day that day What a mess What a marvel We're all the same And no one thinks so And it's okay And I'm small And I'm divine And it's beautiful And it's coming But it's already here And it's absolutely perfect  That day, that day When everything was a mess And everything was in place And there's too much hurt Sad, small, scared, alone And everyone's a cynic And it's hard and it's sweet But it's supposed To be like this  That day, that day When I sat in the sun And I thought and I cried 'Cause I'm sad, scared, small Alone, strong And I'm nothing And I'm true Only a brave man Can break through And it's all okay Yeah, it's okay

      It's been quite the week. Hung out with Sophia and Colleen a few days ago at Barnes & Noble and WalMart... let's just say: who needs sex-ed when you got Sophia and Colleen?? (I think I've found a new pair of hos to call my own [I say that with love]). Also got my tux for SV's prom and wat not (which was yesterday)... Holler. I went with my Amy (who by the way looked like pretty pretty princess in her light blue gown)... Nikita tagged along with us because she thinks we're super cool kids (J/K). I met a few awesome kids (Holler at Autumn, Karen, Warren, Lydia, and the oh so beautiful Joe)... def woke up yesterday at ten or so and went to bed at 6:30 this god damn morning. I attended the after party at SV after the social event, where they had sumo wreslting suit things (STEPH!), inflatable twister (STEPH!), and boxing (STEPH!). Everyone also went to the auditorium to see the hypnosis (or whatever) guy do a show type thing. Quite entertaining to see a big guy think he's got ice cubes in his shorts. It was quite the night. And to Amy: You've proved white girls can dance!!   Today's lyrics are dedicated to Erin Sullivan aka My Buddy for Spring Break 05 (IRELAND!)    ...and soon we cleared the way on the rocky road to Dublin.

      Woke up today (obviously), ate and got ready to head out to get my tux for SV's prom ( I'm going with Amy... hollerrrrrr). This errand ended up taking all of my day. Originally Kim was goin to accompany me to get the tux. Then it turned into Kim, Andria, and me.  Then  it was Kim, Andria, Amy, and me. It later turned into Kim, Andria, me, Amy, Nikita, Loose, Ashley, and Caitlin. Andria then couldn't make it, and Kim and Ashley aren't the best of friends, so Kim dropped out, too. So the actual trip to the mall included: Me, Loose, Caitlin, Nikita, Amy, and Ashley (Also known as my entourage). So the first three went to the mall, and met the latter three there. Caitlin wanted to go to Journeys so we did. And I immediately noticed JB (I saw a big black guy dressed quite conservatively, chewing on a straw... It was obviously JB). He was celebrating his sister Brittany's (Infamously known as Bitty-B) graduation from the 5th grade (HOLLER AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAD!) We proceeded to greet JB, and then we departed. I got fitted for my tux and we wandered the mall and ate. I took a picture of Loose wearing a hat at AE, and we got yelled at because I guess it's illegal to take pictures in stores... which is weird, because we weren't yelled at when we did that in the Salvation Army. I went home, slept a little, read a book for like 5 hours ( The Devil Wears Prada  is a damn good book! Get off your ass, buy it, and read it!)... and now I'm here updating you on my wonderful day.   Darcy, Darcy darlin dear you left me dying,  Crying there in whiskey, gin, and pints of beer  I fell for you my darling dear

      Well today, has been quite the day. Woke up and went to school to take the god damn US History Regents (which was pretty easy considering it was mostly about racism and wat not), and after that went to lunch with the ever magnificent Erin Sullivan (REINA!) and Gina F. (JUICY!) I was on my way to the library to get help with my journal for IB art (SORRY STEVE!), when these hott ass girls pulled up in their nice whip, and picked me up. The driver had an awesome rack... the one in the passenger seat looked absolutely delicious... and the one in the back seat had a great body ( ;-) ). We headed over to caitlin's house to greet the Mrs. and then to Barnes and Noble for no apparent reason. There, the girls decided to play around with tampons. Lucie was mature enough to seperate herself from the other delinquents. After that, we went to Yellie's house for a hot tub soiree. That was quite the event... everyone and their mother was there. ANYHOO, I have a special shoutout for someone I forgot to mention last week: Erin Reina Sullivan:. I've just realized how glamorous and magnificent you are. Ireland won't be the same when we leave it. I love how you put up with my incessant shit and nagging. I    ...es más difícil ser rey sin corona, que una persona más normal...

      Wow... what a day. Rite, so this fat kid won't stop hounding me. I love it when someone thinks their opinion makes a difference when it really doesn't. I'm sure Katie C. and my soulMATE Cait know where I'm coming from (Greetings to the rest of the skinny bitches reading this).  Hm. There are a few things I would like to point out: A) Obesity and having excessive amounts of hair, aren't necessarily a rite of passage associated with puberty. It usually just means your destined to spend the rest of your life making love to your hand.  B) Fat people aren't allowed to voice their opinions on others being cocky, because they don't know about it, considering they have nothing to be cocky about.  C) It's not impossible being friends with a cocky person. It might be difficult for those who don't think highly of themselves, but it's definitely not impossible. D) Some fat people shouldn't be taken seriously. They are complete jokes.   PLEASE NOTE: This doesn't apply to all fat people.      This little piggy went to the market, this little piggy stayed home... This little piggy cried wee wee wee all the way home CUZ HE WAS FAT.

      06/11/2004: "SENIOR CITIZENSIP" Well, today was the last full day of school of my junior year at Binghamton High School. And let me just say, what a year it has been (The best year ever hands down!) I am most certainly going to miss my people in every one of my classes. So I've decided to decicate this entry to people whom I actually like and enjoyed being around:   MUZZI: Nice ass. ('Nuff said.)   Dijana: Oh, my bosomy Bosnian friend. You are honestly one of the only people my age who I admire. You've been through so much and you're an extraordinary bumper and grinder. I  despues de la tempestad, biene la calma     Ashole: What can I say? I LOVE YA!   The rest of the IB Env. Sys. Crew: I'll miss those long ass mornings, intellectual conversations, and steph's random ranting. I    Jessica Diva Puuuuuucek: Girlfriend, you is the one that kept me sane in that clown Kent's class. *Two Snaps* Thank you for always putting up with my nonsense, sleeping, arm in/on your back, rubbing of your shoulders, and my B-S in general. OH NO! NOT THE GUMDROP BUTTONS!    Bobbi Blo  job " STYLE="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;" HREF="http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||job|AA1VDw">Job : Oh my, you've been there for me since day one... literally. I'm glad you are my hag forever and always.    John Juan Mattimore: Although I picked on ya like hell this year in Spanish, I luv ya... ya big H pronouncing conservatist you.   TO THE HOT CORNER IN MATH: You are the sole reason as to why I did no work and failed every damn test. And for that, I thank you. Ya made Phalen's class entertaining. To Raven: LOOK AT THE FAT GIRL!!!! To Inna: I see London, I see France (or Iraq)... And to Katie: Pickety Pick pick, wipe wipe, LICK!   AND FINALLY TO MY soulMATE CAIT, LOOSE-SEAL, AND BROWNIE: There's not enough space on the entire world wide web where I can put into words how much I appreciate you guys. I love you dearly, and I really relly mean that. Thanx for everything. TOXXIC DIRRT '04   06/10/2004: A BRUSH WITH DEATH Well, today was an average day once again... EXCEPT for the fact that I almost died. This band was going to play during lunch on the front lawn of the school, so cait and I decided to go watch. Let's just say, I don't belong in punk/rock shows EVER, but I made an exception cuz I knew some of the band members and cuz Cait loves that kind of thing. We get there, and there's a pretty large group of people there; including those who are "punksters" and belong, and those who obviously don't belong there (Namely my girls Gina F. and Maggie.) The minute I start realizing the music is pretty good, this kid is thrown in my direction (he was crowd surfing)... so naturally, I stepped out of the way. Then, I got caught in the middle of this mosh pit thing... I'm trying to desperately get out (I'm fearing for my life at this point)... I'm getting shoved in all directions... The second I got to safety, Cait pushes me back in there and is like: GO, ITS FUN!... I was shoved around some more, kicked or kneed in my left kidney area... I was clutching my side, for I was in pain... Then, out of the blue, I hear two voices say: NATE'S IN THERE! Two glorious angelic hands pulled me out of the pit, full of nasty ugly people. I look up and it was Maggie and Gina! I WAS SAVED! They then told me I looked terrified and that they knew I didn't want to be there, so they yanked me out. I'm glad I have hot gorgeous guardian angels. I     I whip myself scorned... I wanna hear what you have to say about me, hear if you're going to live without me... I wanna hear what you want... I remember December.

      We might kiss when we are alone When nobody's watching We might take it home We might make out when nobody's there It's not that we're scared It's just that it's delicate

      Well, pretty hectic day. Made up gym, then had a seminar with the Berg on safe driving and the antithesis. It was really sad, I tried not to cry, but when you see a really good friend of yours cry, you just can't help but join in.  EVERYONE: keep in mind that we're not invincible. Be safe.  It sounds like a cliche, but it's so true. Doing a ton of homework that was due ten years ago because I'm a lazy fuck and I like doing nothing to benefit my education. I wish I was like Cait; Motivated, a hard worker, sexy, and gorgeous ;-).  And today, my mom gave me a hardcore lecture on how I need to save money and how my spending habits are horrible. So yeah, she's like pissed at me now. And now I'm bored and I don't feel like typing on here, so I shall find entertainment in the realm known as AIM.  Well an airplane’s faster than a Cadillac   And a whole lot smoother than a camel’s back   But I don’t care how you get to me   Just get to me

      Well, average day today in school. Nothing much has changed. School still sucks. Kent is stilla  cunt rag and a joke. I did go rowing today tho (ROB!), and it was fun. I'll prolly do it again.  Def ended up driving to Wegman's afterwards and had to fucking eat Terimasu with a single chopstick. And now I'm home and  extremely tired. So I'm cutting this short cuz I'm in the middle of conversations with certain special someones. I'll ttyl.   Cold, cold water surrounds me now     And all I've got is your hand    Lord, can you hear me now?

      Holler at your boy. Well, today has been an almost exhausting day. Woke up at 7 to take the fucking SATs (If the SATs are ever to be incarnated into a person, he/she should burn in hell for all eternity), and travelled to CV to take the test. Upon arrival, Erin and I socialized with the other Binghamtonians, and assessed the males from neighboring schools. Our observations helped us arrive at one conclusion: Chenango Forks is infested with beautiful guys. Hopefully hands on research will appear on the horizon sometime soon.  After the test, my mom took Erin home and drove my sis to the mall for her dress. When we reached our destination (Mandee), I wandered off and came across a gorgeous tan thing. The funny thing is he was wearing a CF sweatshirt (ERIN WE  ARE  RIGHT... FORKERS ARE HOTT!)) I also saw Rachel a.k.a. Lolita (I LOVE JEW!). I also unfortunately saw certain people who made we wanna throw up. I later found my mom and went home. Got home, signed on to AIM and had a nice conversation with a certain rower. Advice to everyone (THE 11th COMMANDMENT): If the person you sweat (and vice versa) asks you if you made out with anyone at a wet undergarment contest, the best answer is NO. Maybe this is something widely known to everyone except rowers. IDK. But I'm sure the rower's friend was ecstatic to hear such awesome news. Except... not really. (MACK MODE OFF!)

      Well people, this is officially my first entry in this thing which you call BLOGGER. I would like to thank Mo Cahill a.k.a. Future Hilton Sister #1, for inspiring me to create this beautiful BLOG and for the title: "En Fuego: Latino Heat- El Blog de Nate." Gracias. Today was a pretty average day, went by kinda slow. Abigail and I made a tribute to Valerie in Fashion class on the board, which was so artistic, Picasso would have eaten his heart out (JAILHOUSE ROCK AND SEX!). After school, I went out with Lulu to see Harry Potter 3 (Very disappointing... I feel as if I have a hole in my soul.) Talked to a few people on the phone and realized that we all make big fat mistakes in our lives (You know who you are), and that the world is a reallllllly small place. I also just noticed that it's 11:40 PM (I have SATs tomorrow), this means I must venture to my bed.  PAZ AFUERA  ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT.

I think I'm gonig to Massachusetts next weekend for a family reunion type thing. And I just recently bought a cell phone (FINALLY)... the number is 206-0767, for all of you nosey folks.  I def just got back from an evening out on the town with Loose and Dijana. I was the only person in this threesome without a huuuuuuuge rack. Oh well. We went to see Anchorman (GO F**K YOURSELF SAN DIEGO), and went to dinner at Friendly's (FORGET THE MUNCHIE MANIA... I'LL HAve SOME OF THAT!!!)  My deepest apologies to Sophia and Colleen as I was not able to join them in this evening's festivities in celebration of Marisa's birthday (I THINK). I'm extremely tired, so I think I'll stop typing now.      ...love, love me do. You know I love you. So pleeeeeeeeeease...  love me do .

      The title of this blog is no joke. I AM WEARING NOTHING. I AM WEARING MY BIRTHDAY SUIT.  Anyhoo, I went to work today the QI and did the usual. Emily and I have realized we are the world's worst housekeepers. We ended up jumping on some of the beds, making a landing are out of pillows on a bed an jumping into them in creative ways, and just being horrible in general. After work, I went home (naturally.) My mom left for work, and my dad took my sis and Carlos down to NYC. So again, I had the house all to myself for a whole day.  Later on, a certain guy came over we had some pizza, watched Sex & the City... Let's just say I won't be chilling with that one EVER again. Today is also the day that Rob the Rower :-*(ROB!) leaves for Spain... *tear*... I'll miss you (er, your online persona)... So now (again), I'm updating this blog... and now I'm gonna get dressed and read.      Kosketa minua; älä käsilläsi...

      Today was a regular day... worked at the QI, came home, chilled for a little bit, and talked to the most awesome guy alive (R!)... :-D. Took a shower and wat not, had a friend come over to "keep me company"... JB came over (we watched the lovely Beyonce on TV and assessed individuals based on ASSets), the oh so lovely Sophia came to pick me up so that we could venture on to Barnes and Noble. We roamed (I ate like ten pounds of sugar... and we realized we both know the same Shakkira [AAHHHHHHH!])... Sophia needed a cigarette, so after lighting one, she decided to ask some scary punk guy for a lighter (he was nice enough to lend her one) and she smoked her stoge (ABBY AND VAL!) and we went back in. I ended up buying Jewel's book of poems (which is actually very good) and 4 Blondes (think Sex and the City, but 4 completely different stories in one book). Now I'm home eating cookies and gettin fatt. Ugh.      stop all the world now

      Nothing much has been going on in my fascinating life. Just been working alot and sleeping (doesn't that sound familiar.) Worked with Shakirra yesterday at the good ol' QI, and lemme jus say that girl is fucking hilarious (HOLLER SHAKI!!!!) As far as  amor , things are not looking all that great. There is  one  dude, but I'm not sure that's gonna go anywhere... dunno why, I just have my doubts.  But I am going to make love in a few minutes... to my mattress and pillows. ;-)       donde estas corazon? ayer te busque entre el suelo, y el cielo, mi cielo y no te encontre y puedo pensar que huyes de mi porque mi silencio una corazonada me dice que si

       Eh, today was a regular day... worked at the QI, came home, packed (I leave tomorrow), and I also battled this cold sore (I know... ugh). After packing, I took a nap, woke up and decided to call this dude that I haven't talked to in a while. That turned out to be a very nice conversation (despite the fact that I sounded depressed cuz I had just woken up). So yeah, mid conversation, he decides to talk about his ex for like a second. Didn't really know why. I don't really care if it fits in the topic (as Gina advised), I really don't want to hear about exes. So after that, my good friend @ called me. Apparently her boyfriend fucked two other girls, lied about it... and no one told her, despite the fact that they knew about it. Honestly, people... what kind of world do we live in? IDK. I must finish packing... I have too many pairs of shoes I wanna take and I gotta fit em somewhere. Perhaps I'll watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 later.       Corazon Nate        Loving is good if your dick's made of wood       And the dick left inside only half understood her       What makes her come and what makes her stay?       ... I don't know...

      AHH!!! I'm so tired. I jus got back from an amazing night with some of the coolest people. After a regular day of work at the QI, Emily dropped me off and I got ready to go out. She picked me up and we picked up Loose and Sheila, and then went to Wal-Mart. There, Juliana a.k.a. JuJu Beans met us. She hadnt seen Em in like a bajillion years, so there was lots of hugging. :-) We walked around, I picked up a few things... AND I got a text message from the oh so cool Mark saying that he met John. What John you ask? None other than John Pearis himself. (I KNOW!) After Wal-Mart, Nikita met us all at Hooters for dinner. Em and I had to run back to Wal-Mart cuz I forgot to get my dad's 8mm tape and batteries for Loose. It was tons of fun till we got the bill and scrambled to figure out how we were gonna split the payments and wat not... Then Sheila puked, so she and Emily left... Nikita had to go do something... so JuJu Beans, Loose and I went to visit the ever fabulous Neal at his place of employment Suzy-Qs (or however you spell it)... I must say, regardless of all the teasing and insults we swap, Neal is like beyond adorable. ;-) After some Ice-Cream, melted ice cream and 31 cents later, we left... and now I'm here... listening to GOD aka Madonna, and updating you  on my oh so fabulous life. Oh, and here's a heads up: I won't be updating for a while cuz I'm going to Florida for like a week... so now you know. Ahhh!!!!! Cailtin gets back on saturday (I miss my soulMATE soooo much).... and Rob gets back to Binghamton also on saturday. (Cannot wait to FINALLY get to hang out with him! :-D)  Corazon Nate    "MUSIC -- IT'S PRIMAL AND IT'S VISCERAL ... IT'S ABOUT COMING TO LIFE"

       AHHH!!!!!!!!! It's been so long since my last update. I'm sorry I let my fans down. *tear* Oh well.... alot has happened, but I'm not gonna write every single detail... sooo here's a recap of what's gone down in my life:     Def. got went to a few art galleries and got wasted this past Friday night with Seyma, Katie C. and some other people. Let's just say that black pumps, and Cher have taken on a whole new meaning for those that were there.    A certain someone arrived from a trip earlier than I had expected and that just like, made my year. I cannot wait to spend some  tiempo con el.      NEWS FLASH: Spiedie fest sucks. ["MOM! TIE DYE SHIRTS FOR $15!!!" ... "STOP IT OR I'LL MAKE YOU SLEEP IN THE CAR!!!"]    Corey from PA rocks my world. "TIFFANY? WTF IS TIFFANY?!"     Went to Mass. for a family reunion. Tons of family drama. The Torres clan puts the dys- in dysfunctional. (But Rob's family puts the FUN in dysfunctional!)    I have an ASHOLE fetish. ;-)     Loose is afraid of party snapper things.     I shall never question Emily's driving abilites while she's sober. "BUT YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING!!"    "We're housekeepers. We are the keeper of houses."    "OMG! WE HAVE FOUND THE SECRET!!!!!!!!!" (Oh how I love my Italiana Pimpcess!)     Those are pretty much the highlights of the past few weeks... I'm sure I'm missing a ton, but w/e, you have your own lives to worry about (at least I hope so.) Well, I am now going to bed... I'm very tired... but before I go, I must give a shout out from the heart, TO DONNA MAE: DONNA MAE, YOU ARE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS, THE REASON WHY I GET UP EVERY MORNING... YOU MAKE ME WANNA BE A BETTER PERSON, AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A MAN... I THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU HAVE GIVEN AND DONE FOR ME. I LOVE YOU DONNA MAE!!!!!!!!    This new version won't let me publish my usual signature... so I had to come up with a new one. Here it is:    Corazon Nate       However far away, I will always... :o)
