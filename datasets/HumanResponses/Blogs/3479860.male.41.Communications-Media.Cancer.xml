       Mrs Rasmussen was off on holiday today, and she and I enjoyed the fine weather by doing little else than reading in the garden. Tonight we had a barbecue, but the weather deteriorated somewhat and we had to evacute as it started raining. It didn't really amount to much rain, just darkish, threathening clouds. Then Matthias beat me in Pro Evolution Soccer with a beautiful header on a Beckham corner.

      It's Saturday morning and Mrs Rasmussen is off from work until  Thursday next week on her Mid Term holiday. After a rather glorious  week, it's been raining all morning and everything outside is soaking  wet, including the batch of washing I hung out late last night when  the weather was really nice and warm. Matthias is cleaning his room, and he plans to watch The Fellowship  of the Ring later, which he thinks is very suitable for the weather.  Sofie is still asleep in her room as we speak. I am going into the city centre today to meet a bunch of roleplayers  I found via a website. They meet every Saturday in a book shop in  George Street, and then venture on to play at a coffee shop in Rose  Street. I am hoping to find a couple of roleplayers willing to play  during the week, as I have not played for more than two years.

      How very convenient indeed. This is a feature I could quickly get  dependent on. In the other blog system I used, you had to log on to a  secure site and click 1 million times before your post was online.  This is great, and if this actually appears on the blog, it's working.

      How could I forget to mention it? Last Friday was my last day at uni as a student. I had my Media Law exam last Thursday and then wrapped up another module on Friday, and then, out in the sunshine. I've been in this situation before, but I guess you can never get used to it. It's a mixture of wild joy and crazy angst. What to do now? My gut reaction was to apply for any job anywhere in the UK I thought I could do. But then, I calmed down and thought about my own business. About the dream of being self-employed. You own boss. I still have it. So, there we go, at this point of writing I am officially self-employed. I have a client who needs his website and other things done by the end of June, but after that? No idea whatsoever.

       ...you people wouldn't believe. Not far from where we live lies the small Rosslyn (Roslin) Chapel, and castle ruins, a chapel built by the Knights Templars in 1446 on an ancient Mithraic temple site. I'll say that again: built by the Knights Templars in 1446. The chapel also features in Dan Browns conspiracy thriller The Da Vinci Code. This is an awesome place, awesome! You are in fact standing next to several tombs where Knights Templars are buried, one of which is the chapel's founder Sir William St Clair, third and last Prince of Orkney. And the Scandinavian links doesn't stop here (Orkney was part of the Danish Crone until it was given away as a wedding present to a Scottish Princess many years later). One of the pillars in the chapel depicts the eight dragons beneath the tree of life, Yggdrasil. Huh? Norse mythology in a Christian church? Yes, yes, indeed. The chapel is totally fillled with symbols from ancient religion, freemasons, Judaism and much much more. Brilliant.  urlLink Rosslyn Chapel website

       My friend T gave me a great birthday present: one of those new Google email accounts, called GMail. GMail is going to be a major competitor to Hotmail, and it will feature free 1GB storage. You might never have to throw away emails again, and I know that is something T really likes. GMail is only out in a beta version, and thus not available unless you get an invitation from someone somehow connected to the right channels. The new address is per.fischer (at) gmail.com.

      I just realised that you have to have a Blogger account to post comments on our new blog. I'm very sorry, and apologies to everyone. What really surprised me was that Blogger is owned by Google. Such nazi methods are usually something you encounter in connection with Microsoft ("you want to use this? make an account, give us your details and everything is fine") Sorry.

      I am a year older today, and for the first time ever, the family were not together to celebrate this morning, as Mrs Rasmussen was working in St Andrews. But I opened my cards and presents with the lovely kids before they went to school. Later more cards and emails arrived, thank you all. The weather is truly terrible with rain and storm. Yesterday the Danish football team gave me a nice present when they qualified to the quarter finals in Euro 2004. British television decided to show the match between Italy and Bulgaria instead, morons, so we had to find a neighbor with digital TV to watch the game. Tonight we are having a few friends over for dinner. I am cooking Thai-style lamb burgers in Ciabatta buns, and the buns are raising at this moment in the kitchen.

       Matthias has had the final tests and stuff at Primary school, and he brought home all his things from the last year at school. Among the staments from the school was "Matthias has been a credit to the school", which we thought was very nice indeed.

      Scientists in the US and Austria have at the same time managed to teleport atoms. Or something like that. It sounds good, but I have no idea what they mean. When I saw the graphic explanation, I was even more confused. But it's GREAT. I guess.

      I am going to a graduate recruitment fair today. It's one of those one-day events where companies offer themselves to new graduates, and graduates hope to find a decent job with a decent income. My last 2 million job applications haven't been a success, so I am going along too. There are also workshops where you can make your CV better, as they say. I am still not used to that it is fairly common over here to lie on your CV, or exaggerate, and I can't do it. But the downside of it is that employers tend to look at CVs with a certain scepticism, and who can blame them? My CV is awesome, and that's probably why it doesn't help, I don't know.

      It's a fact. Matthias is going to High School next year, same school as Sofie, who just started S4.  This evening I was attending yet another parents evening at his new school, if not anything else then to buy new school clothes with the proper logo on. When I left home in just a t-shirt, it was very warm sunshine, when I left the meeting it was pouring down and thunder and lightning. I was soaking wet and cold when I returned home.  Four weeks more, then it is summer holidays. Wehee.

      Reagan is dead. He did put his mark on the horrible 80s along with Mrs Thatcher, but making him into a saint is slightly over the top. When Charlton Heston supports a president, it's time to be sceptical. And it's beside the point that Heston was perfect in Touch of Evil, Soylent Green and A Man Called Horse. Having Reagan as president of the World's most powerful nation is similar to letting your hamster drive you to Cambridge in your new Mustang V8. Scary and dangerous.

       We all know and have read the book by Dan Brown called  The Da Vinci Code , so I will not resume it here, only the fact that it turns out there is a plan, a  design , behind the universe and everything. It's called  urlLink PHI , the golden number. As you all know, Phi can be found anywhere - and by anywhere I mean absolutely anywhere. In the human body, in nature, music, colours and physics, to name a few. Even George Clooney is made of Phi relations. It's scary. Phi is linked to the Fibonacci numbers (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34....), and if you divide two Fibonacci numbers, you get Phi. But the big question - and by big I absolutely mean BIG - is, who designed the whole damned thing? God? Moses? The designer from Hell? A fish? An alien from outer space? There is a nice Flash animation of the Fibonacci numbers and the golden section  urlLink here .

      Chickpeas are one of the most wonderful ingredients, and certainly is king among the pulses. Their only irritating feature, if you as I  refuse to buy them in tins, is that they have to be soaked in cold water for at least ten hours before you can do anything with them.  Before that, they are hard as stone and look pretty scary. The fact is, you have to think a day ahead if you want to cook with chickpeas, and yesterday I put the bag of chickpeas on the kitchen to make sure I soaked them before going to bed. But I forgot, only to abruptly awake aroung 1 in the morning suddenly remembering, and then staggering into the kitchen in darkness and pour water over those darn peas. Today's menu is hommous - or however you spell it - homemade hummous, which I haven't made for quite some time because you can buy very good organic hummous in Tesco. The thing is, every time we buy some, it's being eaten in no time. Hummous is a favorite in this family, even Sofie has grown into liking it. Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of Omaha Beach, and BBC visited the town of Bedford in the US, where many men of the A Company came from. The A company were among the first soldiers to try to land on the beach, dodging German bullets and overcoming what must have been unbelievable horror. 97% of the company didn't make it.

      Mrs Rasmussen insists on being called Susanne, at least when she is off on holiday. Granted. Today has been a beautiful day. The kids were off early, as every Wednesday, and we spent time together in the garden - reading, throwing balls and Matthias stuffing his shorts with filled water balloons.

       When I was about 10 years old, or perhaps one or two years older, I loved to read Conan comics, especially those illustrated by the British artist Barry W. Smith. The hero Conan was created by Robert Ervin Howard, a Texan born in 1906 in the small town of Peaster, and he more or less invented the heroic fantasy genre we know as Pulp Fantasy. Howard wrote hard-boiled short stories for Weird Tales Magazine in the 1930s, at a time when other pulp writers, like Lovecraft and Cain, wrote horror or crime stories. Howard was sort of discovered in the 1960s and 1970s, where other writers tried to copy his dark style, but nobody really succeeded. The original Howard stories outshine their copycats by far. Like Tolkien, Howard was inspired of ancient European history and myth, especially Celtic and Irish culture. Unfortunately Howard died far too early when he killed himself in 1936, apparently because of his mother's terminal illness. The story goes like this: Howard typed a small poem on his trusted Underwood typewriter, then got into his Chevy and shot himself in the head. He survived the wound for nearly eight hours, but died 11 June 1936. The four final lines he wrote were:  All fled, all done    So lift me on the pyre    The feast is over    And the lamps expire

      Yesterday S and L came to visit us from London. L is looking for somewhere to stay the next couple of years, as she is starting a BA in Architecture at the art college. Having been in a similar position ourselves, we are glad to help and offer advice regarding where to stay in Edinburgh, and where not, and what it might cost you. L is from the Czech Republic, and it was nice to relive our trip to Prague in 1989, and talk about how things are in the country after the last turbulent decade. We, on the other hand, have decided to go to London next week to visit the guys down there, and to give Sofie and Matthias a good thorough tour de London. We don't have any money, so it's going to be the free offers we are looking for, like walking along the Themes, looking at Tate Modern from the outside, St Pauls, all that stuff.

      Happy birthday, Matthias. We did our usual birthday morning routine with breakfast and presents. Matthias got a lot of clothes, t-shirts mainly, a new cap, a Harry Potter book and a bunch of other stuff. We also gave him a compilation of face-melting rock tracks from Deep Purple to Yes, ZZ Top, Pink Floyd to Tenacious D. Later this morning we are going to see Spiderman 2, and tonight the menu is pork loin. The Sun is shining and the day looks gorgeous.

       Last Monday the DVD version of The School of Rock was released in the UK, and guess who bought a copy? Our very own Matthias, saved from his hard-earned pocket money, and we all watched it again to great rejoicing with our friend R. Afterwards we all listened to classic rock tracks featured in the movie on full blast in the living room, most notably ACDC's Back in Black and Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song. Mmmmmmm. My old electric guitar has been pulled from its deep hiding in a closet and now resides in Sofie's room where it is being played regularly. Life is definitely good.

       My press card to this year's  urlLink Book Festival  arrived today, or "Media Accreditation" as it's also known. I am covering the festival again this year for  urlLink edinburghguide.com . I am not sure who I am going to see this year, but I have booked all the crime writers I could find in the programme, and the playwright Simon Gray as well, and of course Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. The festival runs from 14 to 30 August, and this year's top names are probably JK Rowling, Doris Lessing, war reporter Michael Buerk, Toni Morrison, Alex Garland and Louis de Bernieres. Ian Rankin, Iain Banks and Irvine Welsh will be there as well, as usual.

       We went to Napier University's graduation ceremony today, a marathon event that seemed to transport us all back to the Middle Ages. I was awarded the BA Journalism Medal for "outstanding achievements on your individual Programme of study", which is a great honour I believe. After the ceremony there was tiny canapees and free champagne at the university reception.

      The letter with my exam results came today. I've done pretty well I think. My overall mark from the whole degree is 65.86%. When I look down over all the modules from the past two years, there is only one mark below 60%, and that is 59% in Radio Journalism. Two of the hardest modules, Media Law 1 and 2, have been marked 60.9 and 67.9. I am very pleased with that. The letter says:  The programme board have awarded you the exit award shown below.  Bachelor of Arts with Distinction in Journalism.  The awards ceremony is Friday next week. I will report from that later.

      If you have been a hardcore web user for a while, chance is that you have thrown Internet Explorer away years ago. It's crap, unreliable and generally a security risk to your computer, at least if you are running a Windows product. But many, many people use IE by default. It was there when they bought their computer. It's Microsoft, they are world famous, must be the best then, eh? Wrong. It's easy to prevent IE trouble. Just download one of the other brilliant products and use them instead. If you want to be completely safe, and have the money, use another operating system. Buy a Macintosh computer. You'll love yourself ever after. The truth about IE's ridiculousness has finally arrived in the general media. below is a link from today's Independent describing the problems and the solutions.  urlLink Microsoft's browser dominance at risk as experts warn of security holes

       Our Kia Sportage was having its yearly MOT and half-yearly service yesterday, and everything went smoothly. The tyres will have to be replaced soon, though and so will the brake pads, but so far it's OK. When we came home the fuel gauge was suddenly below Empty. Did they empty the fuel tank at the garage? Hardly, so it had to be something with the gauge. We went by the garage today, and the mechanic had a quick look at it, came back, looked serious, and told us the sender thing inside the fuel tank had stopped working. He kindly asked us if the car was still on warranty, and when we checked it turned out the warranty expires 3 July 2004. How lucky is that? I found a picture of a Sportage same age and same colour as ours.

      OK, now you can post comments without having to make a Blogger account. Let's see how long it takes before I start to get spam comments about medicine and worse things.  June 2004 was the wettest June in Scotland as long as anybody can remember, which is 1953 when they began to write down wetness of months in the UK. Let's hope it's all over now. Tomorrow is the kids' last day at school before the summer holidays, and they want sunshine.  No plans for the summer yet. R is coming to visit us next week, and L is coming early August, but that's all we know. We had plans for France, but it's too expensive. Then Finland. Even worse. UK then.

       urlLink   That's German. It means "the creators" or "the doers" or something. And it's the name of a German boardgame about elections and politics. Sofie, Matthias and I are playing it for the second time. Matthias won the last time, and he is already in front having won the regional elections in Bayern. Die Macher is a complicated but brilliant game by Karl-Heinz Schmiel. It takes a while to get into, but it plays beautifully and with long strategies possible. Sofie plays the Green Party, Mats is the Conservatives and I am PDS, the remnants of the old Communist Party in the former DDR.

      L, not L who came with S a couple of weeks ago but L, have been staying with us for a week, enjoying the warmest weather yet this year in Scotland. This morning I drove her to the airport at the ungodly hour of 5am. That's the good news, because L has to wait 12 hours in Stanstead before the next plane takes her the rest of the way home to Denmark. L armed herself with the world's biggest packed lunch, fruit, drinking water and free text messages. Send us one when you get home, L! I promised a report from our London-trip, but I am still waiting for some images from down south, so it has to wait a bit more.
