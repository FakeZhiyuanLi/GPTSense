      i am stuck on this track, going in circles. willingly, i keep myself here, making endless left hand turns into the same scenery. i see the exit, looming before me, telling me it's time to get off this road, but i falter and remain in place, choosing to stay stuck in this never ending game.   this is my road, my path that i have decided to travel. i can get off anytime i like, i have the strength. don't i?   i am never getting any closer or any further from my goal. the same five mile stretch of gravel cycles before my weary eyes. every now and then i spot a mirage, a slight change in the world around me, but as i get closer it moves away disappearing behind trees of cardboard and words without meaning.   alone in my car, tracy chapman wails, "baby just give me one reason" and that is all i ask. give me one reason to stay on this road. the next exit is closing in and time is short. it's now or never.

      silence spills from screaming lips. acid falls from crying eyes splitting the face and  corroding the skin. lifeless hand wrench and wrangle. blood oozes from the tips of delicate fingernails being eaten by nervous teeth. feet dance, stricken and trembling, moving as if not attached to the body. lungs moan as they reach for breath. neck jerks in agreement to the conversations within. muscles twitch and shudder as suddenly the pain wrecks the entire body.  oh what woes this life can cause on the heart and spirit  of a child's mind.

      psychedelic dreams in a black and white world. fingers reaching beyond what cannot be touched.  insanity for the sane. spinning backwards on my heels. trying to hold on as you fall away.   behind my eyes the lines have blurred. reality is no longer real imagination has taken flight.

      Nothing ever stops No one stops to breathe. Life just pushes  Ever forward. No time to feel Don't even stop to think. Going and going Constantly trudging Against the forces of nature. This city laden in steel, High rises reaching for the clouds Built on the greed and loneliness That comes from that Constant and persistent Need for power and glory. This place -  A beacon for the mongers- Also houses the contrary As lovingly  As it embraces the wealth. The steel and concrete tower over, Taunting you to live here, Work here, BE here. All the while Cold and unphased By the weeping on its steps. The true city of the bi polar, Contrary contradiction of arrogance. Too beautiful to ignore Too unsettling to embrace. To watch it from the outside Is thrilling and spectacular, To exist and survive is a trudging And drudgery of swimming  In a cest-pool of discarded dreams. But the rain washes it all away, And out to the shore  Filled with medical waste The needles of the junkies The discarded butts  Of momentary relief. Around every corner is an addiction- Waiting to take hold Of you neck and pull you down Unto the filthy streets. The drugs, the booze, the sex The pure hunger for the extreme  The desire for the excess. We move in packs Never connecting  Avoiding eye contact Talking and never listening Always lost in the three  Inches in front of their existence Never seeing past their own Cluttered life. Unable to understand their happiness. Avoiding the past pitfalls. Grasping for an unattainable ideal. Refusal to be part of the pack. Separating themselves from  That which can make them feel. These are the dwellers Of this city of bright lights and loud noises. This place that never stops moving. Where time waits for no man And no man has patience for time.

      i have kissed him  in the dark,  in the car, parked behind the building.   i have kissed him  when no one saw, when heads were turned, for a brief second behind the wall.   i have kissed him  at the beach, under the sun, when no one was looking.  i have kissed him  on the playground, on his lap,  wrapped in blankets and laughter.   i have kissed him everywhere,  hidden, cloaked and subversive.  i have kissed him passionately, with every inch of my soul.   i have kissed him and he has kissed me. we have shared moments of beauty  that were never meant to be.   i have seached and sought for embers hot as this,  only to be secretted and shuttered away.   i have hoped and dreamed for understanding such as this, only to be shrouded in lies and treachery.

      voices squawk, bodies flock, they all greedily gather saddistic vultures in gowns.   from each painted lip obscenities slip and sturdy shoes crush delicate fingers.   they dance on this night, a celebration of plight, knowing that together they brought another one down.  left crying on the floor, unable to take anymore, they leave him with giggles as he trembles in pain.   left crying on the floor,  battered and shaken to the core, he knows he will never truly live again.   they dance on this night, a celebration of plight, knowing that together they brought another one down.

      i remember in art school, a project was for us to take the mechanical wheel, go out into nature and without looking at what we were doing, create.  i took custody of my foot pedal potter's wheel and with a few friends went off for the weekend to my folk's property in north carolina. the land was completely undeveloped, meaning we had to crap in plasic bags, and we camped out from friday until sunday.   on saturday, we picked our respective spots on slope of the mountain, settled our equipment and stared at the majesty before us. we didn't play any music, we just listened to the sounds of the woods and the tempo of the  "swooosh, swooosh"  of the wheels.   the object of the lesson was to learn to trust your instincts. as art students, it taught us to believe in our passion and creativity. every peice every student submitted for grades was perfect and clearly reflecting of their surroundings. one girl, that sat in front of a lake, had a wide shallow bowl with ridges on the edge, looking like trees.   with just letting go and trusting myself, i realized that it doesn't matter what the outside opinion of it is, just that i believe in what i have to say, whether in writing, painting, sculpture or mindless ramblings. many people may not view my "work" as good, but i believe in my own creativity.   i don't think too many people are taught to develo pa form of expression. i think if they are, many of the occassions the person gets thwarted with harsh criticism or condemnations at a delicate point in their life. my parents encouraged me drawing when i was a child. that was a great help for me in all of my years - feeling like i always had the ability to express myself in some form. so many kids are bottled up these days, stunted in some manner, confused without the tools to sort it all out. that makes me sad for those kids. no matter how cheezy my pre-teen and teenage poetry was, i could share it with my friends and they would understand how i was feeling. no matter how "empty" my first paintings appear to me now, at that time, they helped me cope with whatever i may have been going through.   kids need some form of creative expression. whether it be music, writing, arts, acting or dancing it doesn't matter. kids need a way to say things they don't understand. they need to be able to learn how to deal with life in a complete manner. sports and educational activities are wonderful, but the arts are as well.   everybody needs to learn how to be able to express themselves without worry or fear of it "not being good enough", because that isn't the point. the point is communicating something that has moved you - it's not a competition. every person's art should be appreciated, no matter their "skill level". if we learned to not rely on outside influence, there would be more artists in the world, exploring their voice, being brave enough to put themselves up to public scrutinty.   somehow a good many people have lost respect for each other's "voices". maybe it's a societal issue, maybe it's a personal issue. for whatever reason, i see artists mocking artists, writers snickering at other writers, and it bothers me. their take on life is different, appreciate it, or, if you have nothing positive to say, move on. don't attempt to squash someone's spirit.   i talked to a friend in tears today because she was openly laughed at for something she had written by the "poetry circle elite". she never wants to share with these people again and doesn't want to write publically any longer, period. that makes me sad. yes, she needs to have more self-confidence but people also need to be nicer.   i have an artist friend that was telling me of a recent show he put on. art is very subjective. some things you get, some things you like and other things you don't. why mock things you don't understand? you can not like it, sure. freedom of opinion. but to proclaim in a loud voice how "infantile" a piece is doesn't help anyone.   i wish people had more support, from their own selves and from the communities they live in.

      familiar places jog my memory - a certain parking lot, a playground or a bar. they bring back images so incredibly clearly. they are the pieces of dreams and times long lost. they remind me of what happiness should be and what is important in life.   one thing about growing up in one town for a long time is the long histrory with it. sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. in the same parking lot i smoked my first joint, had my first driving lesson and it was the first i ever threw up in. in the same playground i did my first flip off the swings, met my friend the first time i snuck out and had the most wholly encompassing passionate night ever. i have history in this place.    i met my first boyfriend at the place where the skaters used to hang out, over there.   i used to wait for the jta [city bus] here when i would skip school.   this is where my friend got arrested for shoplifting when we were on acid.   as much as this city is changing, i can look at pieces of my past that i now hold dear to my heart and remember them. i have so many memories of the beach. that is where i spent the most of my childhood, i didn't go to the local junior and high schools though, i went to a magnent school across town. my friends were from a local all ages club. even though that place itself is now gone, the memories are still brightly colored. the walks to and from at odd hours of the night, crawling back through my bedroom window.    i even ran into someone i met one while he was working a catered event i attended that 5 years ago. he remembered and recognized me because of a tattoo i have.   my point here isn't to ramble on about my childhood and past, my point is this: i regretfully moved back here, now i am finding ways to appreciate coming back to a place with deep-seeded memories. even though there are many times in my past i chose not to revist, there are more that i love to relish. for many years i scorned this place and it's inhabitants, on a populous scale. now, i am learning that it wasn't so much the people themselves, it's the people that i chose.   it is my responsibility to be happy where i live.

      i was recently informed i was added to a will.   i have been doing some serious consideration about my own living will as of late, so for me to be informed by this friend that he put me in his pre-op will started me a-thinkin'.   a will is this piece of paper where we decide, while "sane", who will have what of our remains. why do we do this? because some of our family is greedy? because we want to specially recognize the important people in our lives?  for me, i have left instructions of how long to keep me alive and what not, and am doling out my creative pieces - my writing and painting. i have left these for my family and these for my various friends. i believe those pieces to be things they can most relate to from me.   but this friend specifically, i don't understand how he felt "touched". our friendship was nothing more than idle conversation and relaxation. we went shooting at the range together, exchanged past drug experiences and just laughed.   i met this friend through someone who doesn't like me. i was at a party [when i thought she was my friend] that she hosted and i met this friend and his wife. both very cool people for completely different reasons - which is something i adore about good couples. he and i made promises to hang out - but after all the alchohol, we had both forgotten. he was reminded when the girl-host of the party began to bad mouth me and he called me the next day. the rest is history. we hang out, go shooting and just kill time. i have always been "one of the guys" and it will never change.   so now, this friendship that i never put or felt pressure from suddenly has more weight and importance than i previously assumed - now that i am in this "will", now that i have been put in this place of being deemed "worthy of death's benefits".

      i had a dream where i was happy.   that is not to say that i am not happy now. in this dream, i was complete.   it was a dream of a day, a day in the future, a day i hope for often. it was just a day. i woke up in a bed of soft sheets and warm arms.  his arms . the alarm was making the most annoying sound from my cell phone and i lazily reached over to turn it off, with a grumble. i murmured something to the person i was sharing the bed with and we got up slowly, with the typical scratches, yawns and comments about "decent hours of the morning". the shower was started, the coffee was made and we were eating breakfast, discussing our day as we ran around with egg sandwiches in our mouths, gathing up the briefcases and work tools. the conversation carries over into the car, a mention of a weird dream and off i go, with a swig of coffee before the lingering goodbye kiss, into work.   there are a few emails, both ranting about some issue and then he shows up at exactly the same time he always does. we greet each other with the warmest kiss. we both look forward to this time with each other away from the phones and voices and stresses. we go to the same coffee shop we always go to, make the same jokes about getting the exact same things all the time and have the same wonderful lunch we always do. yes, there were little struggles, but overcoming them brings the joy.   again, both back at work and understanding the particular stress of the day, we send and email or two to help each other get through the day - a reference to a private joke, something mocking a current of stress or any little gesture to show care and concern.   at the end of the day, he greets me at my office, reading or working, as i finish up the day. finally done, he can greet me proper and we head off home, after a quick trip to the grocery store to buy the dinner supplies. the evening is mundane. cooking and talking, watching tv and working, kisses here and there, cuddlies and snugglies at the perfect moments. nothing amazing, but everything perfect. the normal discussion of life obligations and plans we both have made are discussed and sorted out so everything fits. we both rearrange, we both compromise because we understand what is important to the other person.   simple, but perfect.   the rest of the night is something that i will keep to myself, but it was amazing.   the whole dream had a feel of being "everyday", ordinary. that we lived this perfect way, yes with problems, but perfect because we sorted them out. we both took the responsibility and no one was left feeling over-worked or under-appreciated. we understood how each other "is", so the little annoyances or possible "problems" are simply let go if, because that is who we "are".   i don't need money. i don't need fame. i need that. i need the passion for life, the passion for happiness, the passion for each other.

      love. over-written, re-written and under-written. and this is my stab at it.  love is meaningful and meaningless. it's illogical and logical. it's real and a false hope.  love is only as meaningful as you appreciate the relationship and the person you are with. someone's love for you can be meaningless to you if you don't feel the same. because of it, you wake up every morning with a smile, but when it's unrequited or unfullfilled it causes more tears then joy. a past relationship often looks silly when you look back on it years later.  you can love someone for all the right reasons,they can be the perfect person for you - but there are reasons as to why you shouldn't allow it to bloom, but you do. you can land the "catch" and be bored by the simplicity. you can have that "security" but not the fire or the fire and passion with some "struggles".  love is a real emotion. it's a yearning desire to share yourself with this amazing human being in front of you, but it has falsaties attached to it. many people don't understand how to keep love going, how to keep nurturing a relationship, how to play all of the parts for one another as to not fall into a rut. most people don't truly understand the commitment involved. the true, hard commitment to continue to appreciate, be interesting, sexy, be strong, to want for happiness of the other and to want to continue to share your time. love it real, but real love is wanting to do that, to understanding the effort and work that's required to make yourself and your mate happy. you want to re-balance your life just to have that person by your side.   and perfect love is when  both  partners understand that and relish in knowing they will always have each other.

      i was over at a friend's house earlier today when something poignant hit me.   i have lost hope in magic.   it saddened me, to realize that i have rationalized away part of my imagination. i felt i huge leap out of childhood at that very moment. i no longer "hoped santa claus is real, even if i knew he wasn't". i don't have that lurking faith in things unimaginable.  until that moment i had always had a secret hope to have genie powers or tv witch powers. until that thought came across my mind clearly, i had always secretly hoped magic was real. now, it's just something that would make my life easier. "eh." my wish to have telekenesis is to make it so i don't have to get up to get something, not to scare my friends. where did that piece of me go?  i consider myself a child at heart. i play silly, act silly, look silly and just generally let go and laugh. it makes me wonder if rationalizing away god has taken that part as well. stories of magic and god have always entertwined each other seamlessly, on both sides of the coin - magic proving god does and doesn't exist.  have i stolen away my faith in magic by not having faith in a god? now that my belief is very set in the fact that god doesn't exist, not just questioning, unicorns aren't something i hope to be true. i still appreciate the imagry, i love what it represents - but that small voice that would love to see one is gone. it's now replaced with, "i remember when i had hope they were real."  i still giggle at silly things, i still find laughter in a sponge-bob toy that talks, but i fear i have just stepped over "a line" in adulthood, and there is no coming back.

      in this journey of life, i have always had background noise. whether it be the tv, mildlessly droning on behind conversations, dinners and hours spent in front of another monitor, or music, a more active participant in everyday activities, causing me to burst into song or remember a clear event of times past. tv has always allowed concentration away from it, while music screams for attention. in both cases, since i can remember they have been a complete part of my life. in play, sleep, eat, study and creation they have constantly been with me. until recently i started going to sleep with no sounds to accompany me.    once allowed, every image that the outside noise was drowning out filled my closed eyes ceaselessly. every injury, every win - everything i have experienced in my life began crashing in front of my eyes, settling me into a cringing display of want of escape. all of this before i slept. every moment from that day and days passed flashed at horrific speeds while needing relaxation.   i started to avoid sleep until i would literary be falling over in my chair. i pushed myself into some form of exhaustion every day in hopes to side-step the silence. the pictures still flashed before my eyes, but i didn't have the energy to react or attempt to control them. so instead, i would count. yes, the pictures flashed and distracted me, but i decided if i could focus on one simple task, i could sleep. i began counting backwards from 100, every night. i would start over if the images distracted me - teaching myself to ignore these things by laborious tasks. that attempt only lasted a few days. it was horribly repetitive and extremely annoying - and not to mention unhealthy. teaching yourself to ignore yourself isn't quite a positive skill to learn.   back to where i started, avoiding sleep and despising the process, i began turning the noise off during the day. one morning i didn't turn the news on when i got up, and only realized that it was off when it was turned on. during the day, i was re-remembering those images, changing my perspective on them and realizing other definitions than the ones that made me cringe. suddenly i felt creative again. as an art student, you would think i still paint to this day, being it my love and what i went to college for, but you would be wrong. i very rarely paint as i feel my art lacks something important and i rarely have the burst of inspiration. however, once i began playing in the silence instead of trying to fight it, i felt i had something to say. i began to write more, as well. it makes no difference to me if any of it is "good", but the simple fact that i felt as if i had something to say is very important in my life. for everyone to realize we all have a unique perspective on life is very crucial, so for me personally it was a moment of self-realization.   once i embraced the silence, even the pain didn't sting as much.   i won't claim to say that i am completely comfortable with myself, which is all the silence is. there are pictures that make me cringe still, that still bring fresh tears to my eyes, but i can hold those moments dear, now.   i have even grown to accept silence from other people in better ways - lack of communication and response. i still go through the doubt and the fear, but the quiet isn't as scary as it used to be. i have also learned the appreciation of silence in other people. mindless ramblings aggrevate me, conversational competitions annoy me. they always have, but as a person who loves debate, i have always been a more aggressive conversationalist - touting people for pseudo-intelligence barely covering a thick gooey mass of insipidness. as egotistical a that sounds, everyone knows that person who has run just a bit faster, had life harder or makes more money than you - and enjoys telling you about all their better information, all of the time. now, i have swtiched to someone who speaks when i have something to say, not when i need to fill the void. that doesn't mean i am particulary quiet. if it's a subject that i know about, i am a very happily active participant. if something interests me, i am engrossed. i just don't waste my time on conversations on how crazier someone else's day was when clearly 75% of it is a lie.   until these recent days, i hadn't understood how much knowledge is gained from silence. i understood you could learn a vast amount about other people by merely listening to their words and watching thier body language, but i never thought i would come to the understandings i have about myself. i never thought the process could be as easy, either. if i had only realized at the beginning to just let go.   now, when i go to sleep, those images flash before my eyes which turn into stories, which turn into dreams i forget and then, i am awake. it's now a seamless process which requires no effort and is comfortable and soft.   i am coming to peace with who i am and i have come to peace with the silence.

      truth is truth. there is no way around it and there is no way to change it. we try to bend the truth or ignore it, saying, "this time it will be different" but, we must understand it won't.  the tears that fall from my eyes know their source. the sadness of what this truth must be is so much to bear that it's easier to not think and just let the emotions spill forth unfettered. to think and explain the why's and how's only bog me down, leaving me mentally and physically exhausted.  to be truly happy we have to be able to accept truth and not ignore it. we constantly attempt to change what is into what we want, but that isn't life. that isn't the human mind, heart and spirit - that is want of control, something that is a dangerous precipice to teeter on.  i have accepted the truth of what i am and what my life is. i have come to an understanding with the truth of what is and what must be, even if they are two conflicting answers. even if together they bring the ultimate pain and the ultimate joy. i accept that i have made this choice to have the truth tear me up inside. i understand that this is how thing are.  i know my truths.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have you come to understand yours?

      there is a dark sopt, no bigger than the tip of a hair folicle lurking in the back of my brain just waiting to take over. it waits to change my personality, my emotions and my actions. it longs to be the one in control and the one that decides where i go next.  yet the others want to squash it. they want to kill it. they want to risk eliminating "me" for now in the hope that my body will carry on.  i will not allow it.  i will not allow the guessing and playing with my essence for as long as one foot steps in front of the other, as long as it is my eyes that see. i will not allow the possibility for the loss of what i am for what they think i could become.  every step is a new step that i much analyze and reconsider before moving to the next. i do this willingly out of my own choices.  as much as the possibility of hardships exist, i accept they are part of life and embrace them willingly, not wanting to jump too quickly or move to suddenly. i am everything at once. i am all i have shown, all i have spoken and all i have written.  i cannot be me without these things.  i know at times they confuse and compound the facts as life must be, but i move forward with a smile, why can't we all?  i am everything or i am nothing and in this life, i chose to be it all.

      skin to skin innocent hands holding tightly body instinctively repeating the pattern. caution thrown to the wind, hung out the window, held on only by a thin thread of truth.  dangerously close, just a tilt too much can re-enact the plays we remember as often as i breathe.  the prick of the pin at the base of my skull warns me of trouble and keeps me still. the weight of your body held against mine urges me to forget, to please regress.  i don't know what is wanted, what can be gained or how it is good for us to play so close to the edge. one impetuous step and we both fall tumbling down the ravine we have sought to avoid.  dangerously close, just a tilt too much can re-enact the plays we remember as often as i breathe.  we move in time, often too perfectly, one stepping towards while the other must back away. the perfect waltz without any music, our bodies swaying to the loud beating of our impassioned hearts.  dangerously close, just a tilt too much can again destroy those lives we cannot forget.

      we live in worlds that we create. perspectives are skewed and realities are distorted. what we think we see is never the truth because of how we have learned to interpret images for our own benefits. two people can look at the same painting and more than likely they will gather completely different information from it - unless they have been "told what to think".  which brings me to my issues with art history. as an art major, i spent many years in classes telling me what the artists meant by their choice of strokes and color. i was informed of the right answers and wasn't allowed or taught how to interprety the choice of color on my own. that was a "skill" that i chose to focus on myself. even then, red can mean different things to different people. some see it as anger, some joy and some even passion. there are volumes written on color theory. different authors and psychologists telling us how we react to varying hues and patterns. some things hold true, very basic information, that is. blue is a very neutral color. everyone can feel comfortable with a blue. however, yellow is said to be a bight color reflecting joy. i am not personally a fan of the color yellow. to me, it brings warning, caution. it's subjective.  so, how can teachers instruct students on what color "means" when it is subjective? who are we to think that we knew what artists were trying to portray, without the information from the artists themselves. colors, shapes and textures aren't as direct as words. saying "i am angry" means i am angry. however, a distorted circle in hues of reds and blues can cause many assorted reactions by those looking at it.  the best artists i have known aren't "classicaly trained". they aren't ones whose heads are filled with unimportant, so-called facts. the best people i have known are ones that have experienced life for themselves instead of relying on the stories of others and images in two dimensions. yes, scholastic study is important, but knowledge isn't contained in merely books. we need to be balanced human beings, intelligent and world-wise. we need to understand the actions of each other and they only way we can do that is to understand the actions of ourselves. if we don't move around we won't understand action. if we don't understand action we are missing a valuable part of the human existance.

      frustration coupled with indignation stepping forward with trepidation i falter.  words divide a nation a fucked up math equation of you versus me.  nowhere can we be we can you say to me am i allowed to be what is in my heart.  silently i travel skittishly phrasing my words carefully allowing anger easily to flow from painted lips.  accusing me and cursing me you blind your eyes to things you'd rather not see. not allowing the truth to set you free i wait here oh so patiently for a country to wake up and embrace me.  the fcc bans the celebration of beauty behind garbage cans screaming fans cooking pans and holding hands.  instead, we appreciate violence uncomfortable silence and wait for the imminence of joy.  frustration coupled with indignation stepping forward with trepidation we fall.

      i am trying to understand how i can hate and love at the same time, the same instance and in the same situations dealing with the same person.  i adore him for who he is, but hates the decisions he makes, the games he plays, the lies he tells without a second thought.   "but that is who he IS,"  one may say.  "how can you hate him if that is part of him?"   because, i know that isn't his true person. that's just what he has become in these last times and i take my responsibility for some of those things.   "but if he lies to anyone, he could lie to you, just as easily."     i realize that completely, which is why i don't trust him.   "so, let me get this straight. you love him, but you hate him and don't trust him."   as fucked up as that sounds, yes. i choose to hope he isn't repeating those behaviours on me, but i am realistic enough to realize he can be.   "so now what?"   if i knew that, i wouldn't be talking to myself. most days, i want to walk away again. other days, i want to hold on and never let go. it is a pit of confusion i have decided to put myself into because i thrive on the adrenaline. yet, there are situations so far out of my control or influence that irritate me - plans made and broken, ideas shared and then forgotten, promises made that neither of us can keep. i am this tool and no matter how much he disagrees, i know it to be true and yet i still have this naive hope.   "maybe it's time again, to shut the door, and this time for real."   very possibly.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very possibly.

      i have seen the future in the eyes of the morning.  thunderclaps, lightening strikes, downpours of rain, flooding the mind, clogging the heart. the winds will turn sharp pain will echo the land as it rumbles and trembles in fear and discontent. silent storms obscured by words of the sun gather strength in the afternoon's waning light. dance as we may nothing will stop this. pray as we might this is out of control.  what is wanted is not allowed. the truth stings but guilt cuts deep. confusion pours from the eyes of the sky as the weather man grins into the camera. he knows but will not tell. he sees but won't upset. look outside, my friend, look inside. you can do his job, look for the patterns.  buildings collapse needing to be rebuilt. teams come in to decide what to do next. it is time to build anew reconstruction has long since passed. the foundation has shattered the core been broken. now is the time to erect the perfect palace. a place where storms merely shake but not break is to be built again.  the long road stretches out and you, with no umbrella for shelter. limbs break off of trees, crashing into you crashing in front of you. you feel alone but i am there waiting on the other side, with a poncho and a coffee waiting to warm your tired bones. lean on me if you need to rest. scream at me when you are angry. expect the truth when you ask questions. but you will stay solid in your place in the rain. you will not leave your eternal pain.  this storm is yours. created throughout the years. you will embrace it willingly even if your mouth says differently. you will weather the pain and call yourself a man while the one who most needs you is taught just the opposite. you are doing harm.

      she leaned over the sink, rinsing the dye out from her hair, when she felt him come up from behind her, grabbing her hips. she laughed and said,  "can't you wait for just a few minutes? i don't want my hair to fall out."  with a smirk, she leaned over just a bit farther, rubbing her rear into him. she could feel him smile and his hands play around her hips, fingers curling into them.  "you know, i can't concentrate when you are near me," she said.  "there is only One thing you have to think about, right now," he replied.  oh, she was thinking about it, that's for sure. it's the only thing on her mind, day after day. they had been together for awhile and she has never tired of his touch, his scent and his eyes. she could be in the worst mood of her life, but when she looked into those passionate blue eyes every problem disappeared. his hands smoothed her ruffled feathers of stress and his lips took her into bliss - every single time she is near him. maybe it is because their time was so precious, maybe it is because she truly loved him. either way, she wasn't worried about the reasons, she just adored the feelings.  once she was done rinsing her hair out, she piled the towel on her head and turned to face him.  "you were saying," she seductively growled.  he grabbed her shirt and tore it off of her with one great rip, pulled the towel out of her hair and kissed her. she felt her knees go weak and his arms instinctively tightened to hold her up. it was a reaction he had learned to prepare himself for. he was constantly amazed how she reacted to his touch. when he let her go, he took her hand and her brush and she followed him to the couch where he began to brush her long wet hair. she sighed, her head rolling with the force of the brush working through her tangles. she loved the fact he took the time to do the little things for her, shower her with simple yet beautiful attention.  in her state of utter relaxation, she heard the familiar sound she has grown to dread - the sound of her cellphone ringing. she knew the ringtone and didn't want to answer, but she knew she must. with a groan she reached for it,  his  hands still playing in her hair.  after the brief conversation, she turned to him and bluntly said,  "the roomate is on the way home."  "then we only have a few minutes left."  the next 30 minutes were a blur of color and passion and fire, igniting all over her body, leaving her weak and in need of a drink of water and rest. he left with enough time for her to ready herself and the apartment for the arrival of the roomate. something was always cutting them short. maybe that's why their time is always perfect, they are each other's haven that they can't speak about. they are each other's world away from the world. they are each other's secret they must keep. they live in a bubble when together, but worlds apart when separated. yet, no matter the distance, when they meet eyes again, they are locked, together, for just a few hours.

      there is a flower growing in a neighbor's yard that i want to have for my own. i want to cut the stem, replant and regrow it for myself. it is perfect but neglected and overshadowed by the brighter and fuller flower it shares its roots with. the smaller one gives every nutrient it doesn't require to survive to the larger flower, allowing to to grow into the light, full and strong. it balances on the edge of deterioration on a daily basis as the over-powering flower takes and never gives back. i want to separate the smaller more beautiful flower from its strangling partner and give it a life in my home, where it doesn't have to compete for survival, where it is tenderly taken care of.   but what if i kill it?   what if, in my desire to make the flower bloom, it dies? what if the larger flower can't survive without it's self-sacrificing mate? i have killed many plants, many times in the past - so much so i have given up on ever being able to ever grow anything.  i just want to hold its soft petals between my fingertips. i want to be able to remark at its exquisite perfection at leisure. i want to appreciate it like it deserves. i want it to be mine.

      she paces, waiting for the knock on the door. the trivial things in life have been taken care of. her dogs have been fed and walked, she has showered and shaved those parts of her that are so rarely seen by another human and she has cleared her schedule for the day. he knocks on her door, a sly grin playing on his face when she opened it.  "a skirt. niiiice," he remarks.  she knows that he is aware of her reason on this day for wearing a skirt. she is the girl that is always covered.  "do you want to come in for a minute?" she asks, completely sure a few minutes will turn into a few hours.  "later. i have something for you on the other side of closed doors."  a surprise? she loves surprises. she giggles, grabs her keys and things and follows him to his family car. once inside the protective glass and 4 door compartment, he gropes at her legs, reaching above her skirt.  "no panties?"  "none."  "the things you do to me, girl."  he reaches behind her seat and pulls out a large gift bag. she gasps as her eyes get wide, a bright smile lighting up the entire car.  "happy birthday!"  she looks into the bag and spies a little girl crown with matching clip on earrings. she immediately tears intot he packaging and puts them on, batting her eyelashes at him. accompaning that was a perfect gift since her recent accident.  "he's so perfect," she thinks.  she is elated, walking on air. it has been too long that someone has taken such care and proved to know her so well as he did, on this day. she hugs and kisses him while he drives, almost climbing on top of him with driving down the road.  he takes her to a café for breakfast, a spot known for good food and friendly waitresses. she doesn't take her crown off. the entire breakfast is full of innuendo after innuendo. she placing her barefooted toes in his lap, curling them in just the right places. the sunny elderly waitress inquires about a special day, after all, how many 27 year olds do you see walking in for breakfast with a bright shiny crown on.  "it's my birthday," the woman replies.  "oh wonderful! happy birthday! you have many special things plan today, i hope!" she says, eyeing the two of them as if they were a "real couple".  the woman grins at her male counterpart, "i hope so!"  after the gift of the death by chocolate brownie with a candle in it from the waitress, they leave, hand in hand, thanking the eldery woman every so much by leaving a very nice tip. they spend the day as normal couples do, lauging, talking, cuddling and kissing. only, they have limited time during the day to see each other. he must make excuses and lie, where she can't tell her friends one word of the truth. she spends her day, holding his hand, burning the memory into her head since she knows, one day, one of them will grow sick of the lies. she hopes it will be herself first. rejection from any lover is hard, but from a married man, well, it feels harder than anyone else, ever.  she moves his hand up her leg inch my inch as they get closer to her apartment after the full day. silently, he follows her inside to her couch and sits down with her, taking her face in his hands and kissing her so deeply that she didn't even hear his phone ring.  "your wife?"  "give me a minute."  she leaves the room as he talks on the phone for a bit, giving him privacy. he comes to her, wraps his arms around her and says,  "i have to go. i thought we would have had a few more hours. i am sorry."  she nods, not looking at him in the face. when he leaves, he half-heartedly kisses her again, knowing it can't make up for the injury caused.  "i will make it up to you, i promise."  so much time has passed and she is still waiting.
