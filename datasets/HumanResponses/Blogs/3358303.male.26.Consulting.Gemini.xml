      This is a continuation of my previous post...  Bob Metcalf’s law states that the value of the network increases in proportion to the square number of nodes on the network (n 2 ). Metcalf’s law is restricted to asynchronous point-to-point transactions. In Kevin Kelly’s book “New Rules for the New Economy” the value of the network is n n , where multiple synchronous connections are allowed simultaneously.  Complexity theory of network evolution can explain B2B networks. Usually, a B2B is a self organizing network and starts with few connections and through a process called auto-catalysis; they bring more and more connections. These connections form around supernodes. Supernodes go through a growth phased marked by the relative stability of the exchange. As the exchange grow, the system moves goes towards the “edge of chaos” where the exchange loses its utility and stability. Either the exchange falls over the edge (i.e. overcapacity) or recovers and evolves into an agile system.  --The inspiration for this piece comes from this article on Cnet News:  urlLink http://news.com.com/2010-1023-5205844.html

You will enjoy praise and respect from those around you; everybody loves a sucker.

       	 I remember reading something about six degrees of separation. It suggested that we're just one hand-shake away from 300 people, two away from 90,000, three away from 27 million and so on. Isn't that Wild? More on this soon...  If interested, follow this URL below:  urlLink http://backissues.worldlink.co.uk/articles/250100180310/22.htm

      Hello and Ahlan....  As we every beginning one thinks "will this beginning be the real beginning?" I'm not sure but I'm determined. Knowing that in the future I would look back at this post I don't know what or where should I start. I guess I'll leave it like this for now.

      I was logged on to www.takingitglobal.org and found a new thread. It was titled "SWOT Analysis of TIG - Members" it was described as "Submit your thoughts about TIG and tell us what our strengths, Weaknesses, Obsticles and Threats are!"  urlLink http://www.takingitglobal.org/discuss/forumdisplay.html?forumid=1945   This is an interesting development in online communities. Although, previous techniques included message/graphic posting, live chat and polls; giving community members tools to measure themselves is an interesting trend.   Introducing SWOT analysis techniques to advance online communities is interesting. It is usually used for analyzing an organization in-light of competition. However, some scholars in strategy point out some problems with SWOT. An organization can perform a SWOT and with a mono-phonic views (Leaders, focus groups...etc.) They are bound by their mental schema which can cause "blind spots" in their analysis. As the saying goes "If the only tool you have is a hammer, you will see every problem as a nail." -- Abraham Maslow  urlLink http://www.newwork.com/Pages/Contributors/Shelton/Hammer.html   Involving an online community in performing a SWOT on itself is poly-phonic. Yet the diversity of it's members may create conflicting views of opportunities and threats. Conflicts are healthy if the environment is able to harness the power of diverse thinking.   I propose the use of SWOT in online communities but to take it further, by voting in a democratic way on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.
