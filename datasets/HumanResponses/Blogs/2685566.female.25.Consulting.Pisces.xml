      Blah!!! I hate the winter!! I know  hate  is a really strong sentiment, but I've come to the conclusion that I definitely hate the winter and snow and slush and frozen cars and frozen doors, and salt that ruins my car, etc....etc.... I guess all the good weather that we've had up till now has spoiled us. My 5 year goal = move to a warm country!!!  Well, it's a Saturday night and this cold weather has me feeling reclusive. I am not leaving this house unless there's some kind of fire or major emergency. I was originally supposed to go to a show called  urlLink When Sister's Speak  which is usually an excellent spoken word show, but the thought of warming up a freezing car, bundling up, fighting through traffic to get downtown, searching for parking, pay for parking, pay $25 for admission and then coming out of the show to trudge back to the car and once again wait for it to warm up just did not appeal to me tonight. So as promised, I present me.....   Who is  .piscessoul. ??  (I'll give you the basics) .. location   - toronto.. .. sex  - female.. .. age  - 24 [I turn 25 in a matter of months (March to be exact)].. .. eye color  - dark brown.. .. hair color  - jet black (I got a big ole 'fro that I can't seem to tame).. .. background  - my parents are from the island of Trinidad.. .. education  - York University..BA Psychology, CRS.. .. focus  - rehabilitation management.. .. occupation  - student  [I just finished my last semester at University].. .. likes  - You'll learn more about my likes & dislikes soon enough..

      2004 has begun and this promises to be a year of many many changes for me. Hopefully, the year that will impact my future in terms of love, employment, friendship and finances among other things. But in all honesty life (as always) is unpredictable... So who knows what this year will bring.    Why am i here? What is the purpose of this spot?  Lately, I've needed a medium which I can use to vent and express myself. From what I've seen so far, this should be the perfect outlet. I find that at times there are things that I am better able to express in writing than verbally.  So this is just the intro, the bio and my history will slowly emerge. (meaning: I'll post more information about me sometime soon).

      So, I'm on probation at work. My part time job that is. I got bills to pay, so I slave full time during the day, go to school part time  and  work part time at a hell hole.   32 lates for the year. Personally, I think there were more but they just stopped counting after a while. So...my supervisor came at me acting like she was  really sorry to do this  saying that  HR told her  that she has to give me a written warning. Why did she even try to sugar coat it? She knows that I know my attendance sux. She also knows that I'm only there on a part time basis because I need the money  not  because I like the job like half the other suckers in there.  So anyways, back to my original point (whatever that was)...I'm on probation. I have to improve my attendance or else they'll supposedly fire me. (Another load of crap because a friend of mine in the same department has been on probation for over 2 years now). But, I'll play along.   So, I'm home tonite because I start at 8 tomorrow morning. If I had gone to  urlLink Amnesia  and partied like I wanted to, I would have definitely been late in the morning. So, instead...I've alternated between television, the internet, the telephone, and my cds.   Ahhh, yes...my cds.         I went to  urlLink HMV  last night because I  needed  a cd. Sometimes, people do not understand me when I say that I  needed  a cd. I can't even describe it, I just had the urge to hear something new, to purchase something new or even discover a new artist. It just gives me a huge sense of excitement. I must have been in there for over an hour. I kept harassing the dude at the info desk asking him to look up different artists in the computer.  Not ONE damn cd  that I was looking for was in the store. Amel Larrieux was supposed to be released on the 20th...why was there no record of that in their database??  SHYT!!!  I know that the kid was getting aggravated so I eventually left him alone and just started looking around myself. I eventually picked up Wax Poetics'  urlLink 'Nublu Sessions'  and Goapele  urlLink 'Even Closer'  I left semi satisfied but extremely dissatisfied (is that possible?!? It has to be because that's how I felt).  enough rambling...good night...let's hope I'm on time in the morning.....   still anticipating ...Amel Larrieux: Bravebird...  in the meantime rotating ...Wax Poetics &  urlLink Zero 7  'Simple Things feat. Mozez.  ps...i should've f#*&n' gone to Amnesia!!!

      The winter blah's continue... This week is slowly creeping by and I am counting down the days till I leave for Trinidad. Just 28 more days till I'll be basking in the sun enjoying Carnival. Believe me when I say I can't wait.  It's been an okay week so far. I'm doing 2 night courses to complete my certification. I'm interning right now at a private rehabilitation compant and I am learning so much every day. I've had two job offers in the past week, both at non profit community based agencies. One I worked at previously, but they're only offering a short contract and the other is only offering part time. Plus neither is focused in the direction that I think I want to go with my career. My only fear is that I'll  regret  these decisions later on in life. (I don't even want to say the word because my aim is to live life without regrets)...I figure though that these are the choices that life is made of. Remaining in the private field can be risky because ultimately I'll be an independent consultant and my workload will definitely fluctuate but so far it's definitely worth the risk.  However, we'll see......   rotating ....Bilal: First Born Second  and ...Verve Remixed  ...it's almost midnight.....27 days and counting.....

      Last night my celly rang and rang and rang. I have a habit of never turning it off because I want to see who's calling. I forgot I had  promised  a friend I would go to a club with her since her daughter was away for the weekend. But as I already mentioned,  winter kept me home  and my original plan that day was to go to When Sister's Speak which she would not have been interested in since that isn't her thing (read: she finds spoken word and live shows boring). So technically it's not my fault. Don't blame me, blame winter. Last night just wasn't the night to be confined to a sweaty club. And yes, I will tell her that when I  eventuallly  call her back.  So I spent Saturday night with popcorn, my duvet, my couch and a  urlLink dvd  my brother lent me titled  urlLink 5 Conversations about Soul . The film features  urlLink Jaguar Wright , George Clinton, ?uestlove and  urlLink Julie Dexter . The subject matter and concept were both excellent. But the description didn't lie when they described it as a bootleg. Maybe the camera man was scared but his hand shook (and thus the camera shook...to the point were I thought I would have motion sickness) throughout almost every snippet of  ?uestlove.

      Today was another snow day!! The thing about snow days is that they start off great because you experience that initial excitement of knowing you're going to get away with staying at home doing nothing all day. However, half way through the day boredom kicks in. That's exactly where I was at by about 1pm today. I had exhausted the internet, I was tired of sitting on the phone saying nothing and after watching another  urlLink Cosby Show  rerun...television became another blah! All in all, if used correctly a snow day becomes an excellent day to reflect because there's nothing else to do except mull over nonsensical thoughts.  But my thoughts today weren't really nonsensical [atleast not in my opinion]. It began with an email I received from an old  friend  whom I wish I could have gotten to know better before  he  moved. This is a sample of my train of thought....  o/   How is it that certain people know just what to say?  o/    How is it possible that even miles away someone can still make your heart flutter (just a little) ? o/    How is it possible that someone who was in my life for such a brief moment could have had such a profound effect? Permanently elevating my expectations and pretty much ruining me whereby I refuse to settle for anything less than the image  he  presented to me.  So much more has been running through my brain...but I'll stop because I think that presents a general idea of what I've been thinking about all day today.  I've never been in a serious relationship. I've had my share of flings...situations...friends..whatever you want to call it. But I've never really been serious with anyone in all of my 24 [ummm....25] years. I guess, part of self discovery is asking myself  WHY  - which I've attempted to do before. I've come up with excuses, but none that I feel are justifiable answers. Ultimately, I truly believe that it's a combination of fear + stubbornness. Fear of getting hurt, fear of being treated like some of the dumb girls I hear my brother and his friends and my cousins and my male friends talking about. But for some reason  he  had left me thinking of the possibility of taking a chance.  He  challenged me and intrigued me more than anyone I've ever known. It's just unfortunate that  he  isn't physically here for me to express all of the above to him and possibly..............[who knows?? maybe, anticipate more].....  For the first time in the longest while, nothing has been " rotating... " today. [It's now 7pm and usually music is a constant in this house whether from myself or my brother tinkering with his records]. I've been overly caught up in the thoughts above. But I think I've been online too long right now.....It's just sunk in that there hasn't been music in the house today and I think hearing some might make me feel better.....   about to rotate ..... Meshell Ndegeocello 'Bitter'   nahhh, too depressing . I'll spin  urlLink Dwele  'Subject' instead  eagerly anticipating ....Trinidad in 21 days and getting my  urlLink Kobayashi  cd tomorrow [hopefully].....

      Ha! I just checked my email and found out that my night  urlLink class  got cancelled. Grrrrrrrreat. Especially since I wasn't going anyways. (note: snow days are one of the few positives about winter in Canada). I got home from work and spent much needed time in the house by myself....and then they (the parents) came home. They haven't stopped calling my name unnecessarily since they walked through the door. I think they just like the sound of my silent response. Perhaps it tickles them...maybe, they think that annoying me will get me out of this house quicker....HA!! They don't know...I ain't going nowhere, I'm comfortable for now.   On my way home, I made the mistake of picking up  urlLink Krispy Kremes . Yuck!! I have no idea why I did that. I ate one 3 hours ago and I can still feel the sugar slowly rotting my teeth even after vigorously brushing my teeth. I have a diet problem. I don't eat any red meat, I avoid chicken unless there's nothing else at home to eat (which is quite often), I love seafood in general and veggies and fruits. The problem is I  don't    can't don't (sounds better) cook. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem if I didn't live in a house of carnivores. My brother eats anything that can fit on a plate and thinks that the bloodier the better. My pops tells me  he doesn't discriminate ; and my mom (typical  urlLink Trinidadian  that she is) feels that every dish needs a  little bit of salt meat  (read: pork) just to  give it a little flavour . My doctor has also forbidden me to cut meat out of my diet completely because I've been anemic on and off for most of my life.   Last night's menu was spaghetti. Moms knows I wouldn't touch it if she had made it with beef so she made it with ground chicken. Thinking, it couldn't be that bad I decided to be a bit adventurous and taste it. ..............uggggggggggggggghhhh. I felt sick for the rest of the night. I've gotten to the point (since I don't eat beef or pork or chicken regularly) where when I do eat it, I actually feel sick. I went shopping with a friend in the summer and we were looking for a quick bite to eat and after hours of convincing (and the consideration that all I had left after shopping was $3) she ushered me into  urlLink McDonald's  to purchase a cheeseburger which happened to be on their dollar menu that day. BIG MISTAKE!! One bite and that cheeseburger was wrapped right back up and deposited into the garbage. What a waste of a $1.14.  I know it's a simple solution -  start cooking for myself and I won't have this problem.  Believe me, I've tried. In fact, I actually like grocery shopping. I'm a regular midnight customer at  urlLink Sobey's . I just always seem to find myself on the go without enough time to stop and spend time in a kitchen preparing a meal. It's just easier to stop off and grab something or swing by a friend's house who's cooked.   So all this time spent typing on my glorious snow day as resulted in this conclusion:  New Year's Resolution No. 2,229  - No more buying food on the go. Every morning I'm going to pack a lunch and snacks and munchies for work. Every night, I'm going to make it a point to come home and make dinner for myself.  Let's see how long it'll take me to break that resolution.    rotating...  urlLink Esthero : Breath From Another  anticipating...  urlLink Mos Def  (i hear a new album is due in Feb.)

      Last night was fun, but it brought with it realization that I am almost 25. In exactly 37 days, on March 2nd I will be 25.  So, last night I partied with my girls for the first time in  months . I arrived late of course (only because I had a prior engagement). I didn't get to the club till about 12:45 pm. Now it was  freezing  last night (something like -20 celsius), and me trying to look cute ((and not wanting to risk getting my coat stolen from coat check)), shivered outside in the line by myself. As I stood there holding my arms as close to my body as possible, teeth chattering, knees knocking...I asked myself what the hell I was doing there. While I love music and dancing...the club scene in Toronto is  ohh so tired  (to me atleast). Probably because I was hitting half of these spots since I was like 16 and now almost 10 years later, it's all boring. There's no more excitement in getting ready to go, getting in, getting that first drink and seeing all the other regulars. In fact, I initially approached last night with a sense of dread as I got dressed ever so slowly and further procrastinated leaving the get together which I attended before leaving to meet my girls at this party (which also further contributed to my lateness).  By the time I got in (after arguing/flirting with that ever so sexy bouncer at the door who tried to pretend like one of my friends hadn't given him a ticket for me), coat check was full. So I stood in the sweatbox slowly warming up and eventually overheating as I contemplated what to do with my jacket. By the time I had decided to stash my jacket at the bar closest to  our spot , I had consumed two tequila shots, a Coronna and half a Heineken. That marked the beginning of the end..... After being passed a blunt that was circulating, I knew that it would be a  slow  drive home.  I was in my own world as the music pulsated and I danced oblivious at moments to the unbearable heat. Despite my initial dread, I had thoroughly enjoyed myself.   I arrived home safely at 5 am...(obviously: since I'm here posting this today), and awoke at 3pm this afternoon. I love Sundays....next week I'll share with you why.  It's midnite. I started this post at 6 pm. But I got sidetracked and have only now gotten around to getting back online to actually post it.   rotating....  urlLink Goapele: Even Closer   anticipating....  urlLink Trinidad Carnival  which is now 22 days away.

      My computer and internet connection have been down for the last 2 days.  I felt like I was going crazy. I apparently have a  need  to be able to check my email, etc... on a regular basis. I can finally admit it....i am addicted. I think a lot of people have already realized this about me. There have been instances where I've come home at 5 in the morning and  had  to go online. During my little  urlLink Ebay  phase, I was so hooked I would set a timer to make sure I was online when an auction was about to expire.  It's funny, because I honestly don't know if I can imagine my life right now without constant access to the net. Life without the net. You would honestly think that I've had the internet forever. The truth is the internet has only been in my life and the lives of many others for the last 7 - 8 years. However, we've all become so dependent on it that you would never actually know that. I don't even make long distance calls anymore, I talk to my fam overseas through Msn Messenger or icq or just plain ole email. Who mails a letter in this day and age?? If I have to send a document, I scan it...attach it...and click send.....  Sad but true, the blackout this past summer showed me how dependent the world has become on technology. We've forgotten how to do simple tasks without the assistance of a computer or some other sort of technology. I remember trying to call a few of my friends to make sure they were doing okay during the blackout and couldn't get in touch with them. When I finally contacted them once power had been restored, they shamefully admitted that they only had cordless/portable phones in their home and all of these phones couldn't work without electricity.   I also remember going for a walk with my mom and stopping at a neighbor's' house and telling them how we had drank tea and made soup. They couldn't understand how we had done that when we didn't have electricity and were so astonished when we let them know that we had just put a pan on the barbecue and boiled water the old fashioned way. My neighbor (and this ain't no lie) told me that she had thought of that but wasn't totally sure how to heat up the water that way!!!!!!!!!!  ...are we out of touch??? I can admit that to some extent I am...I can not imagine my life without the internet, my cell phone, a car, and other luxuries. However, I'm confident that if they were all stripped away tomorrow, I could and would survive. Unfortunately, there are a large group of people who definitely would have a difficult time living without all of our technological luxuries.   ...rotating...

I have three huge reports that need to be finished before I leave, plus an assignment at school that's due as soon as I get back. I have so much to do....I need to pack and organize summer clothes to take with me. My summer clothes have been packed away and I have absolutely no idea of what I have in terms of clothing. I haven't even pulled out my suitcase yet. Plus I have to buy little gifts for my family (or atleast I would like to). My room is a mess right now, my mom stepped in this morning...looked around and just shook her head. I have LOADS of laundry that I need to do. I wish I could hire a personal organizer to come in, clean my room and organize all my papers and books and clothes and bags and.....everything else that I have strewn all over the place.  I really shouldn't be going away right now due to time & money constraints...but I feel like I really need this break. I might go a bit nuts if I don't escape just for a bit.   rotating...

      This week was long yet short. It started out with me thinking I had soooo much time left to get everything done. But then the days simply flew by and now here I am with two days before I leave.  I need to get crackin'. I leave day after tomorrow and I haven't even begun to pack. It doesn't help that I was out every night from Wednesday night to today. Every day for the last week, I've come home and looked at that suitcase and told myself that I would start packing. And everyday, something alternative came up.  I saw the movie  urlLink City of God  last night.  None of my friends were keen on going to see it and I really wanted to see it in the theatre before it's released on DVD, so I packed myself a bag of snacks and went by myself. I've never gone to a movie by myself. But I think I enjoyed the movie more and was able to concentrate on it and get more out of it because I was by myself. I had a conversation with a friend a few months back who was telling me that he  only  goes to the movies by himself. He pointed out that when you're in a movie with someone else, it's more difficult to keep up with the story line because the person you're with has a tendency to talk to you all the time. Whereas by yourself, the only real distraction is the movie (and where this one was concerned, the subtitles). So, would I do it again? YES, definitely! I think that everyone needs to have days where they spend time with them self and get in touch with them self. That's not always possible when you're constantly surrounded by people.   rotating...  urlLink Kanye West   anticipating...  urlLink sunshine

      This feels good.  I've been in Trindad for a week now and I am thoroughly enjoying myself. The sunshine is a welcome change from the slushy cold Canadian weather.  The speed of life is much slower. It's 4:30 right now and everyone is taking their afternoon nap. It's made me remember that this is the life that I once lived. Taking each moment as it comes and never really rushing or stressing.  But as I sit here typing away, the mosquitoes are gnawing away at my ankles reminding me that in this last week I've grown accustomed to my afternood naps.

      I confess. I cheated. On my plane ride back to Toronto from Trinidad (which happened to be on Ash Wednesday), I decided that for Lent I would give up meat and eat only seafood for the duration of Lent. I was doing fine, considering I'm not that big of a meat eater to begin with. On the plane, I had the salad and at the veggies and rice. I opted for the filet of fish at McDonald's (which isn't unusual since I can't remember the last time I've had a BigMac or Quarter Pounder). I had seafood pasta when I went out for dinner on the weekend. And even convinced my carnivore friend to cook seafood instead of chicken for my birthday dinner. But then...yesterday....it happened. I didn't make my lunch and had to resort to leaving work and driving around to look for something edible. I drove past McDonald's, kept on driving past Burger King, sped past  urlLink Ho Lee Chow  and then before I knew it, I was at  urlLink Swiss Chalet  ordering a creamy chicken soup. Yeah, I know...big deal...chicken soup. But the point is, I felt soooo guilty even after I savoured the soup that I called my mom to confess. (I should have mentioned that we were both doing the 'no meat in Lent' thang). Her response....'Ohh, don't worry about it...I forgot and cheated on that long time ago' [insert trini accent].  So, knowing that I lasted longer than my mother...I don't feel as guilty.  : side notes : I won a free muffin in the  urlLink Tim Horton's  Roll up the Rim to Win contest.  I have a presentation on Monday that I haven't started yet. It's supposed to be an hour long presentation and the library that has all the info I need is closed on weekends. I'm screwed.  I was on time to work yesterday!!! Yay me!! In fact I was 15 minutes early. My supervisor thinks I have sun stroke from Trinidad.  I   need   new music. I'm looking for more joints from  urlLink E-3 . Any other suggestions??  I'm horrible at returning phone calls. I need to figure out how long is too long to just say f*ck it and not bother calling someone back??  However, I hate it when I make the effort to call someone and they don't call me back.  My household finally sucked it up and made the switch from dial up to cable. Guess What?!?! That ish was installed last Tuesday and my email still isn't working!! Note to self: commence hate mail to  urlLink Rogers Wireless . Not having access to my email is frustrating as hell, especially when it has become my primary means of communication.  Finally, I may get shot by every Black person for saying this. But I am  not  feeling Ruben Studdard's song 'Sorry 2004'. Quite honestly, I think the song is wack and is pretty damn annoying.   ...rotating....  urlLink Ellis Hall III aka E-3   ...anticipating....  urlLink Graduation

      Yeah!!! The weather is getting better. I'm so happy. I love spring, fall and summer. I wish I could find a country that only has these three seasons. Any suggestions??  How come  urlLink HMV  still doesn't have the new Amel Larrieux cd? Every time I go in there the staff looks at me like I have three heads. Why?? Because I always come in looking for a specific cd that 9 times out of 10 they've never heard of. The dude thinks I'm a bit of a fanatic because I call and come in person  and  because I was able to spell Meshell Ndegeocello for him. [I see nothing weird about any of this by the way].   And why are they more than willing to order it for me on the condition that I pay $30 plus tax for it up front. Now, I've paid more than $30 for a cd on numerous occasions. But!! Hmv.com has the cd listed for $19.99....so why the (&(^% is it so much more to order it in store???  So umm, I am now 25 years young. [But, I tell everyone I'm 21]. I don't think I look or act 25. But then, how does someone who's 25 act?? Or look?? Who knows, maybe I should move out and start doing grown up things [what are those??]. Moving out is definitely in the plans though. [give me 5 years...lol].  I'm at work right now and since my boss has been away, I've changed the radio station...rearranged our desks...and overall, developed some horrible work habits [such as posting in my blog during the workday] that I need to discard before she returns in a week.  What else....  This week is  urlLink Canadian Music Week . I checked the schedule and found  nothing  of interest. Except maybe for the  urlLink Graph Nobel  show. But I think that it's tonite and I have to work till 10 pm at my part time job.  Speaking of my part time job. I really need to concentrate on improving my attendance and punctuality now that I'm back from vacation. I've been on time so far but I already called in sick once since I've been back. I got to work on getting up on time on Saturdays so that I'm at my desk and ready to go by 8 am.  I need to go shopping and get some spring/summer clothes.  urlLink The One of a Kind show  is coming up at the end of March and the  urlLink Clothing Show  is coming up in May. I've noticed that the trend right now is vintage looking clothing that stores like  urlLink Urban Outfitters  sell at ridiculously high prices. I'm planning on buying my ass a sewing machine to make my own shit. I've already made a really cute belt that everyone goes goo-goo over and I've modified some of my parents old clothes to become my own creations. So my next step is to teach myself to sew. Who knows, maybe I'll even sell some stuff and ridiculous prices just like Urban Outfitters. [hahaha...yeah right!!]  I just realized that I  still  haven't received my Kobayashi cd. I think it's time to start harassing these people to make sure I get my cd.   rotating....  urlLink MadLib : Stevie  anticipating.... SPRING!!! and SHOPPING!!!

        Daily Extended Horoscope  March 02, 2004   Birth Date........... March 2, 1979   Birth Location..... North York, Canada   Sun Sign............ Pisces    There's a joyful method to your madness. Anyone who's on your wavelength will pick it up right away. Pleasure seekers find each other, joining forces to make noise and raise dust. As long as you're happy, you're ripe for the perfect adventure. Stay active and you'll be creative. One is impossible without the other. Discovery and delight are as natural as breathing, as basic and profound as taking a walk on a lovely day. Grow and celebrate among the people that you adore. Anything that you do is fine with them, partly because you're so uniquely different from all others.     It's too early in the day for me to really reflect on what this day has held so far. So I'll be back tonight (or maybe tomorrow) to give a full report.  Until then..... Happy Birthday to Me!!!

      One thing that I refuse to be subjected to is ignorance and arrogance. I haven't really spoken to my father since November as a result of this; and yet another person is on the verge of being locked out for the same reason. In 2003 I decided to stop subjecting myself to unnecessary stress. I was previously the type who easily forgave any wrong doing. I've never been one to believe in 'sorries'; if you didn't  really  mean to do something then either you would not have done it in the first place  or  you wouldn't need the word 'sorry' to express your remorse. Since you can't change the past, I've adopted a new philosophy of learning from my mistakes so that I'm not placed in the same type of situation with the same person again.  So ummm, yeah. I'm back from Trinidad. I was welcomed back with the usual chaos and I'm wishing I had never returned. I've only been back for four days and I'm already out of breath as I struggle to keep up with the rat race of North American life.   rotating...

       Sunday, March 7, 2004       Pisces Daily Horoscope by Astrocenter.com    Recent events in the department of love and romance may have you feeling as if you are simply not getting your needs met, dear Pisces. Remember that other people aren't mind readers the way you are. If someone's behavior isn't sitting right with you, tell them so. Romantic partnerships shouldn't be something that you make personal sacrifices for in order to maintain. They should be something that uplifts and supports your dreams.    Even though I have a tendency to read my horoscope daily (however, never at any set time of the day), I find them to be questionable. From my experience: if you read your horoscope at the beginning of the day, one goes through the entire day relating events that could possibly occur to the predictions outlined in the horoscope. If you read your horoscope at the end of the day, (regardless of how shitty it was), you find a way to relate everything that has happened to the predictions of the horoscope.  Irregardless, I guess I find some sort of strange comfort in regularly reading my horoscope. I can't describe it. I don't necessarily believe everything that is written/predicted. Perhaps, in some way it fictionalizes ( is that a word?? ) my life, making it seem semi interesting.  So, I went out last night and had a  horrible  time because when I got there I started to feel ill. Too make matters worse, at the end of the night (read: 4 in the morning), the line up to get my coat at coat check was outrageously long. A police officer yelled at me to leave; so I yelled back that I was going a f^%&'n place without my jacket. Dude at the coatcheck lost my jacket stub and I didn't end up getting my jacket till about 5:30 am (yup, that's right an hour and a half  after  I had given him my stub).   I don't mind getting home at 6 in the morning if the night was enjoyable. But when it's a shitty night, and you've spent the majority of the night wishing you were already at home...getting home at 6 in the morning just means that you'll be grumpy the next day.   ...rotating....   urlLink John Legend   ...anticipating....

       urlLink    Last night was mother daughter night.  Moms and I saw 'Adventures of a Black Girl in Search of God'.  We both left the theatre raving about how much we enjoyed the performance and were particularly impressed by the actress - Karen Robinson - who portrayed Rainey Johnson.  I completely related with her doubts and questions.  It's odd, because like her I was 'raised in the church'.  My mother has always been a very active member of her church and I know that it saddens her that I have seemingly given up on attending with her on a regular basis.  I've tried time and time again to explain to her the reason for my displeasure/distaste with some of the activities that I've experienced in her church, as well as the dislike I have for the ongoing gossip and controversy that I have observed there.    But, I'm off topic...Let me first tell you a bit about the play (in case you have not yet seen it). The story revolves around a character by the name of Rainey Johnson who is from a Black township in Ontario (Canada) called Negro Creek. She is mourning the death of her daughter, the death of a mother figure and is trying to sort out her relationship with God.  Throughout the play her faith is questioned and she ponders the basis of her beliefs.  Now, I should tell you that I was raised as an Anglican but attended Catholic elementary and secondary schools.  Although I may have taken it for granted at the time, I definitely value the education that I received in religion during my elementary and secondary education. I particularly value the encouragement of one religion teacher who urged all of his students  not  to simply accept any and everything as truth. Because of him, I have always asked questions and believe that questioning better enables me to justify and strengthen my beliefs. (However, I know that not every question may result in a definite answer). Anyways, based on the guidance bestowed on me by this religion teacher, I was brave enough to question one of my Sunday school teachers in church one day. (Note: This was probably while I was in the 9th or 10th grade). She had asked the class to rate our belief in all events in the Bible on a scale of 1 to 10. She went around the circle with every rating in the range of 9 or 10. However, when she got to me, my response was 7.  She then proceeded to ask me to provide a reason for why I had chosen 7; of course I explained to her that there were many occurrence in the Bible that I had questions about and also had recently been learning about the theory of evolution which did not seem to follow with the proposed creation story outlined in the Bible. Not once during my response did I say that I did not believe; my only statement had been that I had unanswered questions. Yet, instead of attempting to provide me with a valid response or justification, this Sunday school teacher chastised me for even questioning any event that I had read about.   This is turning into a much longer explanation that I had planned. To cut it short, from that day forward I distanced myself from the formal act of simply going to church. That days events and other events that came afterwards left me wondering whether these so-called church going Christians were really at church for the right reason. It seemed to be a charade where they sat in pews rocking and praising one moment and then as soon as they stepped out the door, they were whispering, gossiping and criticizing. However, unlike Rainey, I've simply realized that I don't need to be in a specific building to maintain a relationship with a higher Being and I don't need to broadcast to the entire world that I continue to try to build a relationship with that Being. But I am still searching....whether it's for God or for my Self, I really don't know.   ...rotating...   urlLink Red Star Sounds Vol.1: Soul Searching   ...anticipating...  contentment

      Pisces Daily Horoscope  ----------------------------------------- by Astrocenter.com  The attitudes of others towards you, particularly close friends, may seem to be changing, and you aren't likely to be sure about what this means. The fact is, dear Pisces, you are changing, and some of your friends may like what you're becoming, and others might feel less comfortable. You can't stop what's happening - and in the long run it's going to be a very positive process. It just may be difficult now. Bear with both your friends and yourself.

      I can't believe it's mid April.  In fact it seems like just yesterday that I last posted in here (as opposed to 3-4 weeks ago).  This month has been extremely hectic due to night school finals and work and it's been impacting my health.  I was off sick for about 3 days one week and then was off for the entire week of Easter because I had the pleasure of having to have a root canal done.  I need to start taking better care of me.  Funny, I think I said the same thing in a post at the beginning of the year.  I have the day off tomorrow and I am going to the doctor for a full physical.  I'm just anticipating the list of things that she will be lecturing me about.    ...rotating... De La Soul - AOI: Bionix  ...anticipating...   urlLink The Roots concert  on May 13

      Life continues to be hectic.  So much has been going on, in terms of preparing for graduation and entering the 'real world'.    Yeah, that's right. The 'real world' - a world where I no longer have any medical benefits, am working three jobs to try to get my foot in the door and am faced with bill, Bills and More BILLS!! I'm not ready. You see I can admit to the fact that I have been spoiled. I live at home and admit to the fact that I make a very minimal contribution to the house. Don't get me wrong, my parents do not support me, in fact I've had a job since I was in the 8th or 9th grade. But at the same time, I haven't really been paying them back for their support of me.    So here's the update: Night school is officially over.  My internship has hired me on a part time basis. I'm still working part time at my other job and still struggling with attendance/punctuality issues which have intensified because I now rush from job A(internship) to job B amidst rush hour traffic. I've taken on a 3rd job for which I am still in training (which by the way is unpaid). I'm hoping to quit job B by June, because juggling all 3 is killing me softly.  The happier stuff: I went to the Okay Player tour this past Thursday.  That was my release. Lately, I have been craving good music and live music.  I can't wait for more shows as the summer progresses. Now back to the show...the doors were scheduled to open at 8.  However, our calculations (which were based on a precedent set by other hip hop concerts that we've attended) left us assuming that the show wouldn't start till about 10, the opening acts would perform for about 45 minutes and then the main attraction would hit the stage at about 11  (which we still judged to be early).  Anyways, that being said, we arrived at the venue at about 10:30 only to find that the Roots had been performing for about 45 minutes already.  As I said, this was my release, my moment to exhale. And believe me when I say I haven't truly been able to do that for the last few months.  I enjoyed the concert. There were a few slow moments. And it was amusing watching the security wander through the crowd with their flashlights, looking for Chronic smokers to throw them out. It was even more amusing to see the mixture of people in the crowd (95% preppy white kids). But I enjoyed it.    I heard through the grapevine the Goapele is supposed to be doing a show out here next month, and I will definitely be there.   rotating...  urlLink Amp Fiddler - Waltz of a Ghetto Fly   anticipating...  urlLink The Clothing Show

      This is my fourth attempt to post in the last couple days. Twice yesterday, just as I hit the climax of my post, the power went out. So as I mentioned, this is my fourth attempt...if something should happen during this post, i will not be trying again.  So here's a summary of the content of my last three post attempts: - i quit my part time customer service job that I've been holding down for the last three years. - i was ecstatic when the time came for me to walk out the doors of that place for the last time. - i think my managers felt the same way... - i'm going on an eastern caribbean cruise in mid October!  I swear there was so much more content to my post. But right now, my energy just isn't flowing in that direction.  In fact, that was one of the major reasons for my quitting.  In fact I'm tired now.  Since I quit, I've been trying to catch up on all the sleep I can.    rotating... Soul Mosaic: Dj Greyboy  anticipating... convocation

      Ever since I quit the part time gig, I've been spending more money. Money I don't have. Working on a Saturday, I didn't have the luxury of being idle on a Saturday. Now that I'm home on Saturdays with nothing to do, where does Ms.Soul find herself? Shopping. I cleaned out my closet, yet I've filled the vacant spaces and ended up having to buy more hangers. If I keep going at this rate I will be broke before the end of summer.  Don't get me wrong, I love everything that I've purchased. Every single shirt, skirt, earring, bracelet, shoe, camera...I LOVE IT!! I've always been a shop-a-holic, but now that I have the time...the habit has gotten just a tad bit more noticeable.  Maybe I should get myself a part time gig in retail. But then, I don't think I have the tolerance for retail customers.  Dealing with them on the phones was bad enough, much less having to actually see them face to face.    On a side note, I'm very excited about winning a contest recently.  FREE VINYL!! Nothing beats that. I've already decided to give it to the bro as a present.  Moving even further off topic, the  urlLink Downtown Toronto Jazz Festival  is on. Last year I missed out, but this year I am definitely going to be checking the  urlLink Beady Belle  show on Sunday. Even if it means going by myself.

      Have I mentioned how much I hate the real world? If I haven't, let me say it right now....I hate the real world. In this so called 'real world', I no longer have extended health coverage..I have ongoing debt..I wake up Monday to Friday wishing it was Saturday or Sunday..i'm forever irritable..i'm jealous of friends who haven't been 'lucky' enough to make it to the real world as yet..and i always feel like i've never had enough sleep...  Moms thought I was joking when I said it...but i was dead serious. I don't think I'm ready for the 'real world' and I don't know if i ever will be.   I think one of the thing that weighs the most on me right now is my lack of extended health coverage and the knowledge that in my field working basically as a self employed/independent consultant, I won't have health coverage until I purchase it myself. And because I'm just starting out and trying to work my way up...I can't afford to buy it for my self now. This realization hit me with a left hook a couple months back when I had to have a root canal...which hurt like hell...and then got the bill in the mail a couple weeks later...which hurt even more...  Then I got hit with the right hook a couple weeks ago when I sprained my foot (the how, when and where is a whole 'nother story) and again got slapped with the bill for the meds my doctor prescribed.    *sigh  If only I could fast forward a couple years and a few more zeros to my bank account.  If only...  *phew...there, I'm done venting...  There's a few other things that I need to get off my chest (namely my co-worker's comments the other day about the area that I live in)...but i'll save that for another day when it's raining.

      I swear raccoons are evil. Especially the ones in my neighbourhood. I've had a strong suspicion for a while now. But tonite I found the evidence that I needed.  It's Caribana weekend, so I've been partying since Thursday (and still going to work for 9 am each morning). So today consisted of work, stopping by my aunt's bbq, hitting my homegirl's house smokin' and having a drink, repeating the same thing when other guest's arrived and then finally heading home to enjoy a quite evening sitting outside smokin' and enjoying the weather.   Note, I am in my backyard. No one else is home, all of my neighbours are asleep. As I am sitting there, I begin to sense that I am not alone. I peer out into the darkness of my back yard and discover 2 pairs of eyes staring directly at me. Raccoons!! I sit back semi relieved that it's not a skunk and they will go about their business and leave me alone.  I am human right? Dominant? Bigger than them? I sit back and continue puffing. All of a sudden, I notice that 1 pair of eyes is moving. Diagonal to where I am sitting yet towards my house.  I continue to look at the other still pair of eyes. This pair remains unmoving for a moment, staring right back at me, seemingly unblinking. All of a sudden I realize that this pair has also begun to move, again in a diagonal yet towards my house.   My backyard has sensor lights which turn on with the detection of movement. All of a sudden, the sensor closest to where I am sitting flashes on.  Let me tell you, I have never moved so fast in my life.   I was up. Inside. Screen & Glass doors closed. Bar Down. Locked. Before I had even seen the shadow below the light.  No way was I going to let 2 disgusting raccoons take me down.  I'm telling you, Racoons are evil. They saw me come out, sat there in the middle watching me, planning their attack, and then swiftly attacking.  Believe me, raccoons are evil.

      Now, please note the above title must be said in a certain way. It is not 'it's car-ni-val'. NO! If you are familiar with soca, think Destra Garcia. Phonetically, say 'is cah-na-val!' There, you got it. That's lesson one in Trini lingo...lesson two will follow shortly.   So yes, Caribana is here. For those that don't know, Caribana is Toronto's Caribbean Carnival. I say Caribbean because it has evolved to encompass all islands, all people, supposedly boasting unity. (I say supposedly, because as always there is the behind the scenes politics...between the city of Toronto and the organizers of Caribana;  urlLink within the organization itself  [an old link, but BELIEVE ME there hasn't been much change since 2002], between islands and of course, between promoters of the local parties.)   While Caribana does not even compare to the festivities of  urlLink Trinidad Carnival , it is still an event that I desperately hope is able to survive. Not just because of the economic benefits of this festival to the city of Toronto, but because it promotes a sense of culture that I need to instill into my children (whenever they arrive). If you've never experienced Carnival whether in Toronto, Trinidad, New York, Miami or DC; believe me, you don't know what you're missing.   Anyways...despite my love for the festival, I've outgrown some of the events that I used to frequent in my younger days. I just can't tolerate the club hopping from Thursday to Monday night. The chilling out on Yonge Street till 6 in the morning, the feteing on the parade route all day Saturday and then rushing home to get dressed to hit a club right after. Not only can my body not tolerate it, but I look back and seriously wonder how in the hell I was affording that entire weekend when I was not working and still in school.   I still experience a sense of excitement and anticipation as Caribana draws closers. You see, it's not just about going to the events. It's also about the people who come here...the aunties and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews. The fact that everyone is in a good mood despite whatever negativities may be occurring in their life. The reunion of friends and family that you haven't seen in ages and those that you KNOW you only see at this one time every year. They don't come for Christmas, they won't send a card for your Birthday, but come carnival time...they magically appear. Acting like they've been right around the corner the entire time.   I love it!! This is my culture, this is my life, my history. The bacchanal, the feteing, the wining, the politics, the false sense of unity, I embrace all of them as part of my history.   For anyone interested in learning more about Trinidadian political and social culture, I recommend picking up books by  urlLink Earl Lovelace . While his writings are supposedly fictional, there is a historical basis to all the events that occur and I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the characters were historically based as well.   All of the above being said, here's are some links for Caribana related events:     urlLink Toronto Caribana    urlLink Kingdom of Soca    urlLink Island Boyz    urlLink Irie Music Festival    urlLink Mas Toronto    urlLink Fete Net    urlLink XClusv    urlLink Toronto Lime   urlLink Drunkin Masters    urlLink Warner &amp; Associates       Let the festivities begin!!     rotating  ... urlLink IRS: Welcome to Planet IRS     anticipating  ...LONG WEEKEND!!!
