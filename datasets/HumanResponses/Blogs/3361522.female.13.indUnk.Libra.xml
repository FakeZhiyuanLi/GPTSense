      Hey guys! I'm at my grandpa's house right now..Aunt Michelle is home from Hollywood for a year so she can go to John Hopkin's School to become a nurse. She drove across the country in six days and has only been here for about a week. It's good to have her back. Too bad Tomas went back to California..that would have been awesome if he would've stayed here, but I understand why he didn't. His house, his job, his family..all back in California. Haha he gave the landlord 2 weeks notice to move out of his house, because he wants to find a different place..well, he didn't find anywhere to go, so the landlord said that if the girls that were looking at it today didn't buy it, then he could have it. Well, they won't buy it..that's a fact. He took a dead cockroach he found at work and stuck it on the counter in the kitchen to scare them off..and I am almost positive it worked. :D Haha..yeah, today was the mock trial. It was horrible..the prosecution had a great opening statement..and ours wasn't so great. They got Agent Chambers in a few things..(BECAUSE RACHEL WASN'T THINKING haha)..they tried to get Lori Lorcin, but Autumn was pretty good..the only thing was the whole year/month thing. It was in the store for a YEAR, but in a display case for a WEEK. That was the information that the jury did not get..if they would have, I think that we may have won. Anyways, Kevin was being such a jerk today..to everyone. Me and Kristin especially. He's one of those people that is "never wrong". And when they are, they don't admit it. I hate people like that. And he thinks he's so much better then everybody else, but no, he's definitely not. Not with the way he acts. But whatever, as long as I have no classes with him next year, I'll be fine. So here's my schedule for next year...  1 semester..   B1 - Health (even) (Miller)      - PAC (odd) (Nickel)   B2 - Earth Science (Lockhart)   B3 - Graphic Arts (even) (Heiser)      - Basic Foods (odd) (Wampler)   B4 - Hon. American History (Minnich)  2 semester..   B1 - PE (odd) (Hubert)      - Photo (even) (Mellinger)   B2 - English (Zimmerman)   B3 - Geometry (Schwartz)   B4 - French 2 (  not  Ditenhaver :D)  Ok, that's all for today folks. Adios!

      Hello all. Last night was fun. A bunch of us met at Panera for dinner and (of course) coffee. Haha we had a blast! Tonight, a bunch more of us are going to John and Candy's! Yay! Haha and when I got home last night, Ralph, Jer, and Elliot were here and we all watched the Flyers game (they lost 2-1). We ordered pizza from Gio's and it took an hour and a half to get here and then they brought the wrong one..so half an hour later, they come back with the right pizza. Haha I asked Elliot what the bacon cheeseburger pizza tasted like and he goes "Bacon cheeseburger." I guess if you ask a stupid question you'll get a stupid answer. Well, I have to call Kendra and let her know about tonight, so I'm gonna head out. And after discussions with Abby, Elliot, and Meredith, I'm over   him  . After quite a while, I'm fine. Haha yes, I have moved on..to older..*ahemLyleMillerahem* haha, no, I'm good..nice and single. Ahhh, this is the life. Haha   ilu ... abby

      Hey guys! Tonight everyone went to Logan's house to watch Miracle and eat pizza and hang out. Yeah, Lindsay and I were walking around the neighborhood the whole time. We ended up getting lost, being chased by the stupid biker people, being attacked by a dog, having fireballs thrown at us, writing kozup a note and putting it on his car, and learning from Abby that tall guys are better kissers than short ones. Haha, so tonight was a lot more fun than I thought it would be, but that may be because we weren't in Logan's house with some certain people. One thing that I've been wondering about though...what is Meredith's surprise? I have no idea what it could be. It's something made out of wood and only Abby and Emily know what it is. Logan won't tell anyone else. It's something that Logan has never given anyone before (except maybe Abby, I'm not sure). She'll get it at Promo, so I'll find out then. OOOOO kiss the clock! Haha and the clock doesn't have cooties (Aaron)...and you have mine. But they don't taste like anything without the owner and I still have to get your cuties haha. That was funny..Anyways, back to tonight. Me and Lindsay were gone for like almost 2 hours and someone said something about there being a rapist in Boiling Springs, so Meredith went looking for us with this huge stick. They called around the neighborhood to see if we were at anyone's house. The guys were riding their bikes around trying to find us -- haha they were like freaking out! I felt to loved! Haha wow that was definitely the best night I've had in a while. Ok, well I'm not gonna write in here anymore parce il n'y a pas plus parler. I'll talk to you all later, guten nagen!  ilu ... abby

      There are those times when you just feel like running away...when you feel so away from the world. You just need to find a way to get out...get out of all these lies. Sometimes it's just too much to take...to take all the lies. You know it's not true, but you want to keep believing those lies because they sound so good. You want them to come true. You just want everything to turn out right...but it never does. Everything changes. People change. You just want them to come back. When they say, "You've changed, when will the old you come back?", my answer is easy -- I'll come back when you do. It's funny the way dreams work out. They never turn out quite the same way you dreamed them. They twist and turn and dissappoint, leaving you wanting so much more. I don't know which to blame: the dream itself or the reality that dissolved the dream. Dreams of a happy family -- one that doesn't fight over the stupidest things. One that's honest to each other. They don't hide deep secrets. Dreams of the sweet talk being true. But they're lies...all lies. I keep telling myself that I'll be fine...that inside, I'm fine...that my life is perfect the way  everyone thinks. I'll just keep putting that smile on my face. Maybe someday, someone will notice that my whole world has been a lie lately. "How are you?" "Just a little heartbroken, but I'll be fine."  Maybe someone will notice that this world that I've built of love and cheer...it's just killing me inside. Maybe someone will look into my eyes and see a world of hurt that's dying to come out. Tears that are waiting to be cried. Maybe someone will offer their shoulder for me to cry on...someone who cares. Lately, nothing has been going my way. Every time I think I've found a way out of this hole I'm in, it's just another lie. I don't know how much longer I can take this.  ^That's the note I wrote during math class today. Just had to get my feelings out somehow.

      Hello all. How is everyone? Good, I hope. Today wasn't a bad day. School was boring, but the French final was soooo easy! I thought it was going to be hard, but it wasn't. After school, me, Courtney, Trish, Lexi, and Kat went to the weight room. It was..interesting. Kozup was bugging me and Courtney. No, I don't like Kevin. I never will. He's like my least favorite person -- ever. He came up to me at lunch today and was like, "Do you hate me? Why do you ignore me?" Because you're stuck-up and think you're better than everyone else, that's why. Haha no one tell him I'm saying any of this. Anyways, I get my schedule for high school on Monday and I'm really excited..I might have basic foods with Aaron! Haha that will be so much fun! And then I went to Elliot's baseball game..they were up by one when I left. Lyle Miller plays short-stop..mmm. Haha he's so fine. Well, je vais aller mange ma glace.   ilu ... abby

         Hey guys. How is the outside world today? I don't think I would really know. Somethings been going on inside this head of mine, and I don't really know what it is exactly. See, when I fall, I fall hard. And it takes so long for me to get back up. I try and I try, but I keep falling for all the sweet talk. I need to learn to be my own person and not believe everything that I'm told. I just want to be able to keep my heart from getting hurt again. That seems to be the time-line that my life is following. Well, I'm sure that none of you care about this, so I'll move on..     So tomorrow my French class is going to the cafe! I'm so excited! Haha I wish the other class could come too, that would be so much fun! Courtney, we could so take over the lake haha. But, the only bad part about going there as a FRENCH class, is that we have to order in French. Go figure. Ok, well I'm off to study for my science test, I'll talk to ya later, bye!      Love always,      Abby

         Hello everyone. This is my first blog. There's not much to say either. Just that I've been hurting lately. My family is breaking apart at the seams. The whole thing with Tyler and his medicine is killing everyone. It's so hard to live like everything's okay. No one really knows what I am talking about because I haven't told anyone except Kendra. This is slowly tearing me apart. I have to sit back and watch everyone aim to kill, and miss. They land a little closer each time. I'm just waiting for the day they'll hit the target. I feel like that day will be coming oh-so-soon.       With all that said, I'm not doing too bad. My life isn't spinning around in circles anymore. I know what I want, all I need to do is get it. I would explain more, but I have to get going. I'll see you all tomorrow at school. Goodnight.

      So I talked to my dad about everything..he's the one I run to when I feel like the whole world is closing in around me..and he told me something that I don't think that I will ever forget..    Don't create waves. Let the tide roll by itself. I screwed up last night..big time. But I can't take it back..all I can do is apologize and try to earn my trust back. Losing this trust may have been like the worst thing that's happened to me in a while. He was the one that I would go to when I needed to complain about guys or not being able to open my Java Ice..or when I needed a shoulder to cry on. I guess his reaction was just what I needed to get me thinking straight again. Ok, well I'm gonna go get ready for tonight..a bunch of us are going to the erm.."Philip Bongiorno Conference Center"..yeah, we're going to Pen-Del for the night..Kids Camp..hehe it'll be fun..Tim's the lifeguard!!! I haven't talked to him for such a long time, hopefully I can say hey..and I think Pete may be a counselor..so that'll be cool too..and Mike may be a camper..wow, it'll be a little family reunion! Haha, yeah, I'll ttyl, bye!     Oh, and thanks to Tay for the talk..thanks, I needed it. It's Wednesday..Courtney will be home soon. :)     -me

      Good morning all. Meh, I should just say "Morning," because I'm sure how good it really is. Last night was the worst of my life. I did something stupid out of spite and jealousy and it came back to bite me. "You broke trust with me." Those are the words that will follow me for the rest of my life. If I could do anything to take it back, I would. If I had the chance to take it back, I would without a doubt. Aaron, I am so sorry. I know that I broke your trust, and I'm so sorry. This is the maddest that you have ever been at me, and it's killing me. :\ I'm so sorry..  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday All the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one that catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is       you        Meh, okay, I'm going outside..there's so much on my mind, I can't take it. I'm not strong enough for this.

I'm sorry I didn't talk to you sooner..  I think I may have started WW3 in my youth group..maybe 4 and 5 too if I'm lucky..ok, well I'm gonna go patiently await my verbal crucifiction. ::gulp:: bye..  -arb

      Hey everyone! I haven't written in here for quite a while. Last week was Creation..it was such a blast!! Saturday was the best of all..during the Newsboys concert, they did the song, "All God's children sing glory, glory, hallelujah, he reigns." They did it as a worship song instead of an upbeat song..if you looked out around you, everyone had their hands up in the air in worship and all of sudden 3 shooting stars flew across the sky. It was so amazing..like God had everything planned out..it was just breath-taking. Well, a lots on my mind at the moment..I'll write more later when my head is on straight..I can't take it right now.  arb

      Hey guys! I don't think I've written anything in here for a while, so I figured I'd do that today. Not much has been going on though. Monday, I sat around and watched tv all day because I felt like a lazy bum. Yesterday, I cleaned, did laundry, and went for a run. Today, I'm at my moms work for a little bit. I told her I would help her cut out these meal tickets for the Harley Davidson Birthday Bash that's on Saturday. Tomorrow, who knows, I'll probably go to the pool. And on Friday, I'm going to  Panera  for lunch! :D Haha that place is the best! Yeah, last night I watched Grease twice. Haha Aaron's got a thing for Cha-cha. Psh, and he thought he's been an angel all his life. I may have only known him for a year, but in that year, he's shown me that he hasn't been an angel all his life. Haha Aaron, name your car Grease Lightning! And thanks for being a great friend..I've needed that lately. Yeah..haha anyways, moving on. I talked to Kendra a lot yesterday..and so did Pete. I don't know what's going on in my head. One minute I'm feeling absolutely empty and then the next minute I've got so much old feelings in me, I'm like, Wow, I really miss that. I was cleaning my room this weekend and I found my pipe cleaner heart, my singing teddy bear, my poems, and pictures from the famine and from the Valentine's Day Dinner. Those were probably the best times of my life. Wow, do I miss that. Maybe someday, I'll have it again..maybe. Haha Kendra.."Hey, I had this great idea..!" Haha yeah, that would really be nice, wouldn't mind it at all. Lol kidding, kidding. Ok, well I have to go help my mom because that's why I'm here, but I heard this song yesterday and I thought I'd put it in here..check it out..   ilu ... abby  yet another day seems like it's wasted you don't feel you're any closer to the prize a dead end job where there's no future praying that tomorrow things won't be this way things will get better, this I promise you and I know that you won't feel this way forever things will get better, this I promise you and I know lonliness won't last forever yet another day, another tired morning you're catching up to your intentions you're thinking life has to be easier than this maybe tomorrow things won't be this way lonliness won't last forever i promise with all that's in me to leave this emptiness behind    promise :: spoken

      Hey all! So I was listening to my dcTalk cd this morning and I really like this song..so yeah..here are the lyrics.  Hello, goodbye I wanted to say but I guess I Don't have the strength to speak tonight It's tricky sometimes When you wanted to run, you'd always hide You can't find the truth behind the lies  Another day and I'm on my feet But the street feels like it's sleepin' I'm on a mission and it ain't too sweet  You're the reason I'm afraid  Said, you're the reason I'm afraid      But I want you to know   It's killing me   I think I gotta let go   Cuz it's killing me   You're gonna do what you want   But you better believe   It's killing me     Love never dies It's the reason that I won't compromise But sometimes you fall before you fly  I've seen it comin' for quite sometime I don't know what you're thinkin' How can the two of us walk in stride If we dont see eye to eye  You got me all messed up inside     But I want you to know   It's killing me   I think I gotta let go   Cuz it's killing me   You're gonna do what you want   But you better believe   It's killing me   Ok, yeah..I like it, so that's why it's in here. Umm..haha I spent the night at Jestine's on Tuesday..that was a lot of fun. I pretended to call Aaron and she believed me..it was great. She's like "You're such a good liar!" And we went to bed, got up, and played ping-pong and field hockey! Haha I suck at ping-pong..yeah. A lot. Alicia: THE BEAM TEAM IS WIMMING! haha And we went to the pool and Buck, Aaron, Jeff, and Matt were dunking us like crazy! Haha I bet you I got dunked like a billion times..Buck is INSANE! Haha it was definitely fun. We all put that sun tan oil on and the water was beading up..that was funny. Ok, well I'll see y'all at the pool later this week..ILU!!!!    -me

Haha oh, right, that was me and Lindsay. Well, tonight, it's at Lindsay's, so I don't have an excuse to get lost..I'm like there all the time. And Jon/Kozup don't live there, and Lauren won't be there, so I don't have a reason to go for a 2 hour "walk" tonight. But you gotta admit, that was a fun night. Lindsay, we had so much fun! Almost killing Kozup when he saw us the whole time! Oops. Ok, well my mom wants me to cut out these dinner things for her, so I'm gonna go, I'll ttyl, bye!  ilu ... abby  "oo, I love the way you, love the way you love me.."

      Today was a day unlike any other. I made Meredith cry in math class. Jestine said I should make my letter a book..or at least give it to him. But if I gave it to him, yes, it would get things out in the open, but it would cause so much more heartache. And I don't need any more of that. I've have more than enough lately. In my letter I was talking about my eyes. The way they change colors..it just makes them so pretty. And I wonder how he could notice that much, but not notice the pain that's hidden behind them. Maybe his own eyes hae blinded him from the truth..blinded him from everything except whats "real". Heh, maybe. Haha my new favorite 10th grader said that he wasn't going to stand by and let me get hurt by some punk that messes with my head. I'm like, I LOVE YOU! Haha I'm so glad I'll have cool people to protect me next year..I have a feeling that I'll be getting myself into a whole bunch of sticky situations that I will need help getting out of. Ok, well dinners ready, so I'm gonna go, I'll talk to ya later, bye!  ilu ... abby

      I absolutely LOVE this song..  Crazy Mary is a slow girl who looks up to no one.  Would do anything for a cold one.  Wishes she could find her way home.  Got the look on her face and the stare of a ray gun.  We walked by everyday and I wish there was something I could do for her.   Maybe if I took a little time to talk then she'd heal a little if she wants to.   She can run but let's teach her how to walk away now.   I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll laugh a little if she needs to.  There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind.   She watches the world pass her by like a freight train.  They all call her the same name.  Laughin' as they point and stare at her.  So she crys out to God up in Heaven, been prayin since she was 11.  For Him to send someone to meet her there.   Maybe if I took a little time to talk then she'd heal a little if she wants to.   She can run but let's teach her how to walk away now.   I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll laugh a little if she needs to.  There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind.   And no one knows the thoughts, the dreams,and the ideas she's got and contains inside.  She's broken apartand her heart is still lookin for somewhere to feel alright.

      Hey everyone! So yesterday, I was talking to a very wise person and I said that when I get mad, I have been given the oppurtunity to be mean. But that very wise person said, "No, you are given the right to say or do something stupid that only makes matters worse." I realized that I tend to do that.. a lot.  Love and appreciate the time that you spent together. Stop thinking about what could have been.   She said life could be so simple if people learned to pray.   I love you. Those three words have my life in them.   I'd like to run away from you, but if you didn't come to find me, I would die.   The best feelings are those that have no words to describe them.   Your voice makes me tremble inside and your smile is an invitation for my imagination to run wild.   She talks just like a woman, loves just like a woman, she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.   Please tell me you're just feeling tired.. cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break.. I'll wait until tomorrow.. Maybe you'll feel better then.. It seems worth the while to see you smile.. So quiet, exhale.. Another wasted breath.. Again it goes unnoticed.   The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return.   Once in a while, in the middle of ordinary life, love gives you a fairy tale.   When you love someone, all your saved up wishes start coming out.&nbsp;   Time passes slowly and memories fade, but the vision of my love holds true to this day.   I wish that there weren't people like you. I wish all angels could be true.   If your wishes wouldn't die, or if your heart couldn't lie, if maybe you wouldn't cry, then you could let your soul begin to fly.   Give up, it doesn't get better. I would know, I've been wishing forever.   What is love? Is it something I once knew? I always thought love was me and you.&nbsp;   Wishes, wishes, they don't come true. Wishing on wishes to be with you.   So that's it for now.. I've got to go print out a picture for Lindsay and then I'm off to my mom's.. maybe I'll write more when I'm there. See ya!  &nbsp;&nbsp; Love always .. abby

      I know that they are just trying to protect me, but I don't need it. I don't need people telling me what to do, where to go, who to be, and how to feel. I can do things on my own, choose where I'm going on my own, I can be my own person, and I certainly can feel on my own.. I've been doing that for quite a while. Yeah, sometimes, I do get hurt, but if I didn't, I wouldn't know what true love is. Sometimes when you fall in love, you fall too hard. And when you fall hard, you hit the ground and sometimes, it's so hard for you to get up. Ugh, guys, I'm trying.. but to no avail. :\ Just keep trying..  we never talked about it because you never even cared and what you really wanted i never even had  because what may seem right and what may be wrong seems out of sight in this place we belong giving everything  giving everything for love I'm finding out that it's not enough there's nothing left between you and I I'm finding faith but losing us where worlds collide  together we seemed perfect a fairy tale for show and looking on the outside you'd never even know  that we're just not right when compromise is wrong seems out of sight in this place we belong giving everything  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       Hey guys.. not much has been going on here.. I haven't really done much of anything this summer.. so I've had plenty of time to think about everything and I've realized that nothing is going my way. It's like nothing ever happened, like I never mattered, everything is just.. fine. But I'm tired of everything being fine. I want to stand out, to be more than just a memory. I want to be real, but he's already got that I guess. Well, while I'm trying to save my world&nbsp; from crashing in, I heard this song today:    &nbsp;  Beauty queen of only eighteen   She had some trouble with herself   He was always there to help her   She always belonged to someone else    &nbsp;  I drove for miles and miles   And wound up at your door   I've had you so many times but somehow I want more   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved    &nbsp;  Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   I know I tend to get so insecure   It doesn't matter anymore   It's not always rainbows and butterflies   It's compromise that moves us along   My heart is full and my door's always open   You can come anytime you want    &nbsp;  I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain    Look for the girl with the broken smile    Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved    She will be loved     &nbsp;  I know where you hide   Alone in your car   Know all of the things that make you who you are   I know that goodbye means nothing at all   Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls   Tap on my window knock on my door    I want to make you feel beautiful     &nbsp;  I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   And she will be loved    &nbsp;  Please don't try so hard to say goodbye   Please don't try so hard to say goodbye    &nbsp;  I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Try so hard to say goodbye    &nbsp;  Love always .. abby     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Hey guys. These past few days have been, well, interesting. My mom got into her house last night, but I think that will change when he realizes that she was there. And some more great news on my mom's side of the family.. Josh. Last Monday, he got sentenced to 5 years in prison. He served one last year after it happened..&nbsp;so he has 4 left. You know how much he's going to miss? Bill's graduation,  my  graduation, Aunt Michelle's graduation, Mike's graduation. 4 years is a long time. And he's not in one of those local 10-person jails.. he's in the state prison. No more dealing with the little guys.. he's moving on up to the  big  one. I don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard to take all of this is, but sometime's I feel like it's too much. No, I always feel like it's too much. He's my cousin! I can't take this anymore.. I don't know what I did to put myself into this hole. I feel like the whole world is crashing down on me and I am not strong enough to stay standing. I gotta go get ready for tonight.. I have to keep myself busy.

      Oh yeah.. here's another song.   For all those times you stood by me  For all the truth that you made me see  For all the joy you brought to my life  For all the wrong that you made right  For every dream you made come true  For all the love I've found in you  I'll be forever thankful baby   You're the one who held me up  Never let me fall  You're the one who saw me through it all   You were my strength when I was weak  You were my voice when I couldn't speak  You were my eyes when I couldn't see  You saw the best there was in me  Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  You gave me faith 'coz you believed   I'm everything I am  Because you loved me   You gave me wings and made me fly  You touched my hand I could touch the sky  I lost my faith, you gave it back to me  You said no star was out of reach  You stood by me and I stood tall  I had your love I had it all  I'm grateful for each day you gave me  Maybe I don't know that much  But I know this much is true  I was blessed because I was loved by you   You were my strength when I was weak  You were my voice when I couldn't speak  You were my eyes when I couldn't see  You saw the best there was in me  Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  You gave me faith 'coz you believed   I'm everything thing I am  Because you loved me   You were always there for me  The tender wind that carried me  A light in the dark shining your love into my life  You've been my inspiration  Through the lies you were the truth  My world is a better place because of you  You were my strength when I was weak  You were my voice when I couldn't speak  You were my eyes when I couldn't see  You saw the best there was in me.  Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  You gave me faith 'coz you believed   I'm everything I am  Because you loved me   I'm everything I am  Because you loved me

      Hmph.. I just talked to my mom.. and things aren't looking up at all. :\ I can't get into it now, though. I don't know how things are going to look like in a month or two. Maybe at Pepere's or maybe in an apartment. I don't know. Well, here are two songs that have been on my mind lately..    i love you with all my heart .. abby  Whose eyes am I behind? I don't recognize anything that I see Whose skin is this design? I don't want this to be the way that you see me  I don't understand anything anymore And this web that I'm tired of  Is taking me right up these walls That I climb up to get to your story It's anything but ordinary  And when the world is on its knees with me It's fine And when I come to the rescue I get nothing but left behind Everybody seems to be getting what they need Where's mine? 'Cause you're what I need so badly But I'm anything but ordinary  Can you save me from this world of mine? Before I get myself arrested with this expectation You are the one, look what you've done What have you done? This is not some kind of joke, you're just a kid You weren't ready for what you did, no . . .  And when the world is on its knees with me It's fine And when I come to the rescue I do it for you time after time Everybody seems to be getting what they need Where's mine? 'Cause you're what I need so badly But I'm anything but ordinary  I think I'm trying to save the world for you You've been saving me too We could just stay in and save each other  I'm anything but ordinary.. I'm anything but ordinary..  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  They read you Cinderella; you hoped it would come true. That one day your Prince Charming would come rescue you. You like romantic movies; you never will forget. The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet. All this time that you've been waiting; You don't have to wait no more.   I can love you like that. I would make you my world: Move Heaven and Earth, if you were my girl. I will give you my heart, be all that you need; Show you you're everything that's precious to me. If you give me a chance: I can love you like that.   I'd never make a promise I don't intend to keep. So when I say forever, forever's what I mean. I'm no Casanova, but I swear this much is true: I'll be holding nothing back, when it comes to you. You dream of love that's everlasting. Well, baby, open up your eyes:   I can love you like that. I would make you my world: Move Heaven and Earth, if you were my girl. I will give you my heart, be all that you need; Show you you're everything that's precious to me. If you give me a chance: I can love you like that.   You want tenderness; I've got tenderness, And I see through to the heart of you. If you want a man who understands, You don't have to look very far.   I can love you; I can: I can love you like that. I would make you my world: Move Heaven and Earth, if you were my girl. I will give you my heart, be all that you need; Show you you're everything that's precious to me.   I can love you like that. I would make you my world: Move Heaven and Earth, if you were my girl. I will give you my heart, be all that you need; Show you you're everything that's precious to me.  I can love you like that. I would make you my world: Move Heaven and Earth, if you were my girl. I will give you my heart, be all that you need;

      Hey all! I haven't written in here for a while. I left for the Pocono's on Friday morning..and we hung out at the pool all day. We went to Red Lobster for dinner. The next day, we went to the Raceway so that Pappy Ralph could race the stock car..we were there until 2ish. On our way home we saw this guy get hit by a car and Nan got out and helped the guy. His arms were broken.. on one arm his muscles were hanging on the ground and the other one just had cuts the WHOLE way up his arm. His leg was broken.. it was bent so weird.. his foot was like, backwards. It was gross, but the only thing that saved his life was his helmet. We went back to the hotel and then went to Lonestar for dinner. On Sunday, we went swimming and on our way home, we stopped at TGI Friday's..and then Bruster's, but not Cold Stone. :( I came home and went to Kristin's..we played manhunt and I had to chase Andrew up a tree without falling down..which was hard, but I did it! Haha, it was fun.. and I taught everyone how to play A-hole..or Crap (thanks to Lindsay and Kristin). Then we played American Idol.. and then we watched Aladdin! LINDSAY, HE IS SO MINE! Or I could have Eric.. or Phillip. One of those three. Haha we are so doing that for Halloween. Ok, well it's lunchtime..I'll talk to you all later, I love you!    -abby  ps lindsay.. she's human! cpooch! haha

      Hey guys! Today has been pretty uneventful. My brother is being a brat with Mark and Grammy is about ready to smack them all. She unplugged the tv as punishment and when she left, they plugged it right back in. Stupid. But whatever. Hmph. Two years. I'm talking to Meredith and she's depressing me. In two years, Aaron will be gone. But that's okay..we'll go visit him at Messiah..because that isn't too far away at all. Aww..Aaron's my buddy..and he claps loud..but that's okay..me and Mere sing loud :) Ok, well this is cool..check it out.  You say we've got nothing in common No common ground to start from And we're falling apart You say the world has come between us Our lives have come between us But I know you just don't care  I see you, the only one who knew me But now your eyes see through me I guess I was wrong So what now? It's plain to see we're over I hate when things are over When so much is left undone    love always .. abby

      Hey all! How are you? Well, today was pretty good. I went swimming for 3 hours, got a shower, went to see Shrek 2 with Lauren, Brianne, Kristin, Emily, Sarah, and Kendra, and then I came home. Since then, I've been doing absolutely nothing, but I'm ok with that. I'm kinda tired though and my back is killing me, but that's not really anything new. Now, I'm singing Christmas songs to Kendra. Oh, I like this little quote thing       Once in a while,      In the middle of     ordinary life,          Love gives us a     fairy tale.      I just thought that was cute. Ok, well I don't really have much to say. Ok, we're not going swimming. Me, Peter, Kendra, and Stevie..we're not going swimming and I have to say, I'm okay with that. I'd wear my skiing outfit anyways. Aniles? Cafe? Lake? Hmm.. probably. Alright, well I'm done babbling for one night..I'll talk to y'all later. Bye!     love always,       abby

But that's ok..then I went up to Matt's room and he played the guitar for like 3 hours..it was a lot of fun..he's really good! Eww, but then he threw his bloody pick at me..it was soooo gross! Bleh..but then I like fell asleep..I was really tired and he was playing Aubrey and it was so quiet, I just like slowly started to fall asleep..and then he put on an Anti-Flag song..it was so loud! After that, he put on that stupid BIRD song..I thought I was going to die..haha and I broke his guitar that his mom wanted him to keep..that was funny. I forgot to give Matt Jr. back before I left..and I have another one of his necklaces too. When I left, everyone else got there (thanks Adam). Marshall was like, "Hi Abby, bye Abby!" Erg..that was annoying, but that's ok..Odie, Tiki, and Moe LOVE ME!!! Haha then I came home, watched Save the Last Dance and ate some cookie dough..and now here I am.      I see your true color shining through    I see your true color, that's why I love you    I see your true color shining through    I see your true color, that's why I love you  It was a cute movie..ok, well I'm really tired and my back is killing me..so I'll see you all in the morning, g'night!  love ... abby

      Why, hello everyone. So last night, I didn't see Pete, Tim or Mike. Haha no family reunion, but that's ok..I thought that we were going to KIDS camp, but we went to YOUTH camp..that's why I didn't see any of them. Haha but while we were there this guy sitting across the aisle from us kept staring at me and Steph..haha it was really scary. =O And on the way there, Julie's like, "Amber isn't a virgin," and I'm like, "Well, I'm not either." But I meant to say that I was..yeah, so came out wrong. Candy was like, "EXCUSE ME?!?" Haha, oops. And today I went to Little Buffalo..and I fell asleep without and sun-tan lotion on and I REALLY got burnt..my legs, my back, my butt..ow. It hurts to sit down.  Blondie3535: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! ice is cold on my butt! pixiemoe08: do you have any clothes on?!? Blondie3535: no im running around the house naked  Blondie3535: =O  Haha..that was funny..so I'm sitting here talking to Kaila, Kate, and Kristin (heh KKK) and listening to Christmas music while watching Save the Last Dance. Girls can multi-task very well :-D Ok, well I'm gonna grab a sandwich or something little before I head over to the Clugh's for the night..that should be fun! I'll ttyl, bye!  love always ... abby

      Hey all! Yeah, still working on that long letter I promised you all, but it's in the works. It's coming together.. a little slowly.. but I'll have it on here by Friday, I hope. Speaking of Friday, sorry Jon, sorry Emily, I can't go to either. I think I'm going to Big Spring to watch my cousin's band concert/dinner thing. If I don't do that, I have to go to a camp fire at Camp Thompson to pick up my brother from his camp. So today has been pretty boring.. ONE WEEK UNTIL PRESEASON. Ahh, so not ready.. I told Lindsay that she has to come over here to go running with me.. seriously, she does.. or else we're both going to die. But I HATE running.. just like Autumn said on Friday night when she was over: "I don't like any kind of running.." Amen to that. Yeah.. no one is on right now.. I think tomorrow I want to go to the pool, but I don't really know how that's going to work out. Well, I'm leaving now, because I'm bored.. so uhh.. bye!  Lindsay, call me if you want to go running!!!     Love always,       abby :*

      One more day of hockey camp.. and then a week and 3 days of relaxation.. and then I die. This is going to suck. Well, next week, I guess I'm not going to sit on my butt and do nothing becausethen I would REALLY die during preseason.. so I'll have to run next week so that I kind of am in running shape.. then the cross country trail won't be as bad. Today, I did the crab walk, somersaults (they KILLED my back!), and cartwheels.. but then we had payback haha. Everyone is even now :) Hmm.. I am so excited for the football games.. those are always the best. Our first game is against Big Spring, which is cool, because 1) Stevie plays for Big Spring, 2) We'll kill them and 3) Brett's playing in the band.. so that will be awesome.. I'm excited already! Then we play Big Spring in hockey a few days later.. so that'll be fun.. triple dose of Bubbler beatings, I hope. Oh, I read this today and I liked it.. so I'm putting it in here..    If it's really over, there's nothing I can say   I'll do my best to hide the pain and turn and walk away   But do me one last favor and pretend you're hurting too   After all we've been through, it's the least thing you can do  Alright, well I'm all chloriney from being in the pool all afternoon.. so I'm going to get another shower and I will see some of you tomorrow at hockey and I'll talk to the rest of you later.. Love you!      - Abby

      Hey guys.. how is everyone? This week is hockey camp at the school.. it's going pretty well, but I hate playing defense.. I suck.. more than usual. Haha and it's so hot.. but we'll all get used to that.. in two weeks preseason starts.. and that is going to suck. REALLY suck. They don't call it "Hell Week" for nothing.. I'm  soo  nervous.. I hope they don't cut people.. that would be awesome! So I read this really cool little.. thing.. I don't really know what it is.. just a letter, I guess. But I really like it, so I think I'm going to put it in here tomorrow. It really makes you think about some things, I have to edit and add, but it will be awesome after I'm done with it. It's long, but it makes for some good reading. :) Ok, well I think I am going to go.. I will talk to you all later..  I love you!     .. arb ..

      Hey all! Well.. yesterday I went to Hershey Park with Dad, Sarah, Tyler, Courtney, and Greg.. it was fun up until I passed out and then my shoes got stolen. It was a really weird day.. :\ And today, church was at Trine Park.. Evan got another fever, so we came home.. and here I am. I don't have much to say because not a whole lot happened.. and my heads kind of up in space..          WALK FOR LIFE!! IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, LET ME KNOW!!!        On the way down      I saw you, and you saved me from myself    And I won't forget the way you loved me    And on the way down    I almost fell right through     But I held on to you
