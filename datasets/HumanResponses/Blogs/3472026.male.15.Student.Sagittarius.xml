      You know what's sad? This is my 18th blog I've written. Hopefully, this will be my only one I use from now on... Go to  urlLink   visit my previous blog.  I really am getting sick of GameFAQs "Best. Game. Ever." contest. Basically if a game is going up against a Final Fantasy game, you know the other game is going to lose. I really hope GameFAQs makes another contest excluding all of the games that the SquareSoft (or SquareEnix if you give a shit) fanboys would usually vote for. What I really hated was that Doom (One of my all-time favorite games) actually won once, then went against Final Fantasy III, and lost. You damn well know that if the Final Fantasy was'nt in there, Doom would have been in the finals. Ah well, I can dream, can't I?

      Apparently former WWF/WCW wrestler Bam Bam Bigelow is going to be opening up a ice cream stand in Pennsylvania. I'd be excited to see Bam Bam return to WWE in a ice cream truck and challenge Terry Funk in a "Ice Cream Retirement Exploding Cage Death Match". I'd pay to see that match.

      I was watching Conan O'Brien last night, and they re-aired the episode with Lorain Bracco. They mentioned when she met Salvador Dali. I loved it when they showed a picture of him every time they said his name. Could someone please tell me where I can find that picture of him? I would really appreciate it!

      I can't believe it. WWE has awarded their world title to John "Bradshaw" Layfield. The world title is given to people who the company believes can "carry the ball" and lead the company to new heights. With Layfield holding the title, the company will reach new lows. Remember a couple weeks back when I said that Layfield did a Nazi salute in the middle of the ring? Well, apparently WWE was supposed to punish him for his actions. I guess a world title run is a punishment for a wrestler who did a Nazi salute in Germany, and attempted to rape various younger talent backstage.  Knowing WWE's booking skills however, Layfield will be a  FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME! FIVE TIME WORLD CHAMPION!  Oh well, my opinion does'nt matter since I am just a "Geek who uses the internet".    Song of the Moment:   Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out

      I joined the NWA-TNA Street Team today. Looks like I will be promoting NWA-TNA's brand of pro wrestling. Personally, I believe that NWA-TNA is everything that WWE should be. NWA-TNA has faith in their younger talent. I would love more than anything to see people like AJ Styles, Low-Ki, Christopher Daniels, and The Amazing Red in WWE. If they did come in though, they would probably either be stuck on HeAT/Velocity or sent to the development camp (Ohio Valley Wrestling). Plus NWA-TNA has faith in the talent WWE didn't have. I love the attention that NWA-TNA gives in people like D'Lo Brown, Raven, and K-Kwik (Ron "The Truth" Killings). I really don't think that WWE would have put Raven in the main event scene since they believe he doesn't have "drawing power". Bullshit. Raven was one of excess biggest stars. I think if the writing staff wasn't so far up Triple H's ass, they would definitely have a spot for the lower talent. To paraphrase the great Jim Cornette...  I'm The Dork Knight, and that's my opinion.   urlLink       Song of the Moment:   Black Sabbath - War Pigs

      First off, I would like to state that I am sick and tired of the WWE wrestling personality know as John "Bradshaw" Layfield. Ever since he developed the persona as a arrogant stock market financialist, I have hated him. Recently on tour of Germany, Layfield did a "Heil Hitler" salute in the middle of the ring to rile up the fans. You have to be the biggest moron in the history of the world to do something that low-class. Who cares if that makes the fans hate you even more? What about the people who lived through things like that? Oh well, WWE doesn't care. They'll probably have him beat up a homeless person next week. Whatever. At least justice was served when CNBC fired Layfield from their network. You know what's funny though? At one point, I thought of Layfield as one of my favorites. I loved watching him wrestle with Ron "Faarooq" Simmons as the A.P.A. (Acolyte Protection Agency). Sadly WWE broke the team up. Maybe Layfield will go back to being a "beer drinking bad ass". I can dream, can't I?  I feel like playing The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for some reason. Oh well, see you later!    Song of the Moment:   The Cure - Love Song

      It's been quite some time since I've talked about the pro wrestler know as JBL. Since the time I talked about him on this blog, (CHEAP POP!) my opinion on him has changed. When I see him in the ring, I still cringe. However, I believe that the JBL character has changed. Instead of insulting different ethnic groups, he just acts like a pompous ass. Two weeks ago, he was challenged by Undertaker for his title. I did chuckle a little when I saw how JBL reacted to the Deadman. "I'm sorry, I can't fight you at SummerSlam, I'm... Um... Going to face.... SHANNON MOORE, yeah Shannon Moore at SummerSlam!" At least he is trying his hardest to make himself a "Cowardly Champion".  I just picked up "The Big Lebowski" today. That is a great movie...    Song of the Moment:   The Beatles - Golden Slumbers

      I have no clue why I am referencing a line from the old show "The Critic" in my title for this entry, but oh well.    Apparently WWE has released the Samoan wrestler "Rikishi Fatu". I could'nt be happier. In WWE, Rikishi was just a overweight joke. All he really did was just dance around, and rub his ass in people's faces. According to various online wrestling news sources, they "released" (Another word for fired) him because he was milking an injury he had recieved not too long ago. While on the injured list, he wrestled at a indy wrestling show (Which was run by his uncle Afa The Wild Samoan). If he had such a bad injury, then why did he fight at that show?

       Rick James passed away this morning at 9:20 AM in his sleep at his Los Angeles home, per his spokesperson. He was 56 old. He is survived by his 3 children and 2 grandchildren.  Last month, he performed his hit “Fire & Desire” with Teena Marie at the BET Awards. He had finished an album and was preparing for its release next year. He was also in discussion with various studios for a movie based on his life.   Born in Buffalo, NY known as the King of Punk Funk, and the bad boy of Motown, Rick James blended the hard core funk of his predecessors’ James Brown, Sly Stone and George Clinton with the Rock and Roll theatrics of the Rolling Stones and Kiss. Rick James was the quintessential “Super Freak,” a term he coined in the 1980’s with the multi-platinum song he wrote, arranged, produced and performed sharing that same title. The single catapulted the album Street Songs to #1 on the R&B charts and #3 on the popo charts. This mega-talented, multi-Grammy and American Music Award winner played at least five different instruments and had not only sold in the millions himself, he had written and produced songs for the likes of Eddie Murphy, Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Teena Marie and Smokey Robinson, all selling in the millions as well. He had licensed his work for the use of sampling by artists such as  Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu and MC Hammer, who’s sample of “Super Freak” for the hit single “U Can’t Touch This” made Please Hammer,  Don’t Hurt ‘Em the biggest selling rap album in history.  Credit: www.rickjames.com   A few days ago, it was announced that Dave Chappelle was going to make a movie about Rick James. Looks like it won't be happening. :(  We'll miss you Rick. :(    Song of the Moment:   Rick James - Superfreak

      I've been reading online that Chris Benoit will be dropping the World Heavyweight Title at SummerSlam. Even though I was strongly against WWE putting the WWE Title on JBL (I still somewhat am), I am not against the WWE giving Orton the World Heavyweight Title. Why? Even though he hasn’t been around in wrestling that long, I believe that he deserves the title. Orton  CAN  works a crowd into hating him. When Orton developed his persona of the "Legend Killer", he has slowly; buy surely made me a fan. When Orton spit in the face of my hero Mick Foley, I was extremely upset. However, when he did that, he cemented himself as a credible "Heel" (In wrestling lingo, it means bad guy). When Orton fought one-on-one with Mick at WWE Backlash following their three-on-two match at WrestleMania XX, it instantly became one of my all-time favorite matches. Foley may have lost, but Orton proved that he was worthy of someday becoming the World champion because of all the bumps he took. He did things like having Foley throw him off of the stage, and having him land on thumbtacks... Yes, you read that right. Thumbtacks. Believe me, those things are said to hurt like hell.  All in all, I believe that Orton could very well be the future of wrestling. Sure, Orton will never be as good a champion as Benoit, but he'll be pretty damn close.
