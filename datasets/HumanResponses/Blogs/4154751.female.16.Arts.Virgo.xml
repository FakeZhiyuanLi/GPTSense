       ok well. first post. basically this is my secret blog, the one none of my friends know about. i'm doing this because there are things that i think about that i dont really want to talk to them - or anyone, for that matter - about. but then again.. this keeping to myself thing is just eating me inside out. so instead i choose to cast this blog message thing out into the void. maybe someone will read it, maybe not.       some background on me : my name's mei-ling. it's chinese, after soong mei-ling, the wife of chiang kai shek. i'm 16 years old. my mother's chinese born in malaysia, my dad's british born in england. so i'm a mutt. i live in hong kong, always have. when i was 8 my parents divorced because of my father's infidelity. things pretty spiralled downwards from there.       well. the thing that i'd like to unload today is kind of a cliche teenage angst. basically, a week or so ago i was in a club, open bar, and i was dancing, and then all of a sudden i started making out with a guy. don't worry, i knew him. he was a friend of a friend who was visiting from the states. and i had thought he was cute, yadda yadda and i  seized my oppurtunity.  haha.. yes..       so anyway! we got to second base (as juvenile as that sounds). and the reason i'm all weird about it.. is that i'd never done anything like that before. i mean, i've only had one real boyfriend in my life (we went out for 3 months, i dumped him) and we'd only ever kissed. and we was my first kiss. my first kiss when i was 16 to my boyfriend, and then second guy i ever kiss i dont know and i get further with him than the boyfriend. weird.      ok so the real thing that's been getting to me is the next day we just acted like nothing happened. (i'd actually been advised to do this). so when he didn't talk, i just assumed he didnt want to.. or i dunno. i dont get guys.       i always wait for guys to make the first move. partly because i'm scared - guys arent normally interested in me. but mostly because from what i've learned about them, when it comes to vulnerabilty and 'talking about things' they scare off easily. obviously i know there are exceptions. so when it comes to talking and stuff, i think it's wise to just let them take their time, but them going up to a girl is going to be less traumatic and messy than vice versa. ad i sure know for a  fact  that i'm going to be the least traumatized, what with me history. so, when he didnt talk about it, i let it be.       but then! a couple days after we went on a boat trip, and afterwards, after i see him probably for the last time ever, i learn that he said (in a surprised manner) "actually nobody's talked to me about it." so... what does this mean? he was waiting for me to talk about it? he wanted me to? ughhh!! so confusing. i know i shouldnt even be thinking about it, because there's really no point. he lives in the states, i'm realistically never going to see him again. so why am i constantly dwelling?! i hate this not knowing thing.       so yes!! hard to get all my thoughts together.. this might be a little incomprehensible. but oh well.
