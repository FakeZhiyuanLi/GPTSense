      I'm back from Alive which is a really big relief. Even though I had a really amazing time, I am so glad to be home because it was so muddy and disgusting being there. But man did I have a good time. I even met famous people!!!! Actually I met one famous person and just saw a bunch more.  Kirk Cameron was there. He gave an amazing seminar that really made a lot of awesome points on evolution and such. His story about his life was just so amazing. He taught me a lot. Afterwards I got his autograph then waited around after that to get a picture taken with him. Me, Holly, Kelsey, and David were the ones in the picture. David kept going back and talking to Kirk about either A) his wife or B) Jerry Seinfield. It was so hilarious.  I made a lot of good friendships on this trip, too. I made pretty good friends with Sarah Mangipane. She's really cool. I also got a lot closer to Kelsey and David and Andrew and Angel (grrr, I know, but I couldn't help it) and Amanda and everyone else that went. It was fun. Except for on the last night when SOME PEOPLE wouldn't let me sleep.  The bus was actually a lot more fun. David Castle and David Zambron amused themselves by burping into a megaphone repetedly, David Zambron timed Shane Pritchett as he peed in a gas station restroom because he was sure he could pee for more than one minute (he only got to 45 seconds), and in the next room over Andrew Heberling was peeing (and just to let you know, the next room over was the girl's bathroom; he claims the boys line was too long, but all people who know Andrew probably know better than this).   Some of the other cool peeps I saw were Mercy Me, Stacie Orrico, Switchfoot, Pillar, Rachel Lampa, Lakita Garth (who was this really awesome speaker), Mike Williams (another really awesome speaker, but not as cool as Lakita) and, Of Course, Kirk Cameron. Every time I think about meeting him I feel like pinching myself.  I'm gonna get my pics back in a couple of days, so that'll be really awesome. Then I can actually prove to people that I met him and saw Stacie Orrico. I didn't take pics of the other people, but I did take an entire camera's worth of pictures on the bus. So that'll be good. And a bunch in my tent.   Well now that I've written about an entire novel, I think I'm gonna leave the rest up to your imagination and laugh in your face because I MET FAMOUS PEOPLE!!!!!!! And I also now have a better understanding with Christ which is what I was hoping to accomplish. That was the best part. All of you atheists out there, DONT BE!!!!! Life is so much better with God in it. There's this tremendous amount of comfort in your life and it makes you feel so much better about death because you know exactly where you're headed. Its great.   Peace out, Dwarlings...

      Wow. I'm incredibly tired. Like really really really tired. But I have to stay up late tonight and get ready for Alive on Wednesday!!!!!! I'm packing so much crap I have to be sure it will all fit. It's for five days, tho, so if you think about it it's probably a good thing that I'm a little over-prepared.   Tomorrow is Holly's 16th birthday. She sucks; she's gonna get her license and crap really soon and leave me in the dust. Bitch. No, I'm just kidding. She's not. But I'm still mad at her. I got her present for her today; a dvd and cd case. And I got her this one notebook thing a long time ago with this gay pig thing named Olivia on it. Sorry, its this thing we have about Olivia. She's our bitch.  Well now I'm gonna go watch Best Week Ever because it is the AWESOMEST show ever. They make fun of crap on it and it's really good. They made fun of Harry Potter the other night; man, I was like laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. It's really mean, but dang is it funny.   Meet you over the river...

      Well that's it. I'm no longer a freshman. I'm so glad about that, too! School sucks. At least it did. Now I no longer have Algebra. Even if I failed the exam, I still won't have to re-take it because they average out semesters and I gotta B last time. So that's good, anyway. I can't wait til I can actually have a chance to get an easy A or B in math. Before, just to get a B, I had to work really hard and I hate that. What can I saw, I'm a lazy butthole.  I'm really bored right now. I think I'm gonna watch "Pirates of the Caribbean" right now cuz I LOVE that movie and I feel like watching hot pirates run around. Especially Johnny Depp!!!! Whooo is he a babe!!! Him and Orlando Bloom swordfighting; it's like a woman's wet dream fantasy. Sorry if that's nasty, but if guys are allowed to think perverted things about women, then girls should be able to about guys. At least that's my point of view.  Well now I'm bored and kinda tired. The MTV Movie Awards are on tomorrow night and I'm really excited!!! Love those things.  Have a nice rest of your life.  (One week til Alive!!!!!!)

      Wow, I cannot believe that the school year is really over. At least it will be tomorrow. I am really excited. I totally cannot wait until I really don't have to go back for a whole summer! It's gonna rock!  Only 8 more days until Alive!!!!! I super excited. I've never really been on anything with a church before and it'll be great to get a chance to become closer to God. I really need to go here to strengthen myself. Plus, my friend Holly got me really into this Christian band called Relient K which is a really awesome band. My fave song is "Sadie Hawkins Dance". IT's awesome!  If I clean my room out really good over the summer, my aunt's gonna let me get it painted. So man am I gonna kick some butt!!!! I'm gonna go for this like burgendy/pinkish kinda color I saw in this magazine. It's really cool and I think it'll look good in my room. Hopefully anyway.  WEll I gotta go; last day of school being tomorrow and all. Me and Hol are gonna go out to eat tomorrow after she finishes her 7th hr exam. I'm exempted, but math is tomorrow. I'm gonna pray really hard so that I can maybe get help from God on doing good on it! WISH ME LUCK!!!!  See you all on the flip side.

      Tomorrow I have to take my first exam of the week. I'm really not looking forward to it. It's kinda hard to look forward to it when it's an exam and those things aren't really things most people look forward to. Okay, now that I've confused everyone alive, lets move on.   I saw a friend with a blog, so I was like "awesome! lets make one!" so I did and thats why I'm doing this now. I'm sure no one will prolly ever read this, but that is a ok with me cuz it just kinda takes my mind off things.  On the 4th I went and saw Harry Potter with my pal Holly and her bf Andy and his ma and sister. It was a pretty good time. Then we went to eat at the Olive Garden. Andy's mom was really nice to pay for all of that. I was really respectful of that. We had fun.  Well now I'm officially tired. I don't have to go to school until 10:30 tomorrow cuz I'm exempt from two exams, but then that stinkin gay 4th hr exam had to pop up and now I have to go or else I prolly would have just skipped the whole dang day.  I guess I'm leaving. Adios.

      I came back from Mackinaw City early this morning (like, midnight) after seeing a play and eating out. It was actually pretty fun; something I wasn't really expecting. I went with Stephanie, Katie Reed, and Kelsey Moore. It was completely free; the play, lunch, dinner, and anything else we wanted if we had enough money. They gave us $25 and we could spend it as we pleased only it was suggested that we use it on, like, meals. I ended up buying lunch at Burger King, a buffet supper, and a Frappicino (I lllllloooooovvvvveeeeee those things!) The play was a little lame but it was still cute and I enjoyed it. Plus, IT WAS FREE (if you didn't already get the memo). &nbsp; Today I didn't really do much of anything. I watched a little television, finished my book, and am now watching "I Love the 90's" and eating a cookie. Awwww, what a life. Guess what?????? ONLY TWELVE MORE DAYS TIL I GO TO CALIFORNIA!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hahahahahahahahah....I'm going, you're not!!!!! Hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!! &nbsp; Okay so that was a little mean. Sorry to rub it in your faces...not. Hahahahahahahahaha. &nbsp; Peace out, A-Town...

      Aloha...  Yesterday night Katie Reed called and asked me to go swimming with her. So we went to Horst's house and swam with her cuz Justan. It was pretty fun. Even though I accidently kicked him in the face! But he was trying to flip me over while I was resting on my noodle. Bad move. Then he whacked me in the face with a different noodle. And then Katie jumped in the pool and right when she did the power went off. It was hilarious! She thought she caused it to go out!  Then I spent the night at Katie's house. We crashed pretty early but we weren't exactly sure what time because the power went out at her house too and screwed up the clocks. Even this morning we didn't know what time it was! Then we went back to Horst's. We waited with Justan, Tyler Coats, and Jared Miller until Justan's mom came back home so we could swim. Then he went to football camp and me and Katie swam for like 5 hrs! We were doing flips and crap and being complete losers but it was so fun! We'll prolly go again sometime this week.  I'm going to Cali in two weeks!!!! I'm bummed because I'm gonna miss the fair and Katie's barn theater play, but I'm gonna make her mom take pictures. And the fair always makes me sick anyway. I just wanted to see Holly's horse shows and stuff.  Holly's camping this week so I don't have anyone to confide in. Stupid loser. Oh well she'll be back soon. Me and Steph and maybe Katie are going on this free play thing on   Friday. It'll be fun.   Aloha...

      Today I haven't really been doing much. I started another sort of blog thing at www.xanga.com but its not quite the same as this one. I'm sure I'll prolly update both of them just as regularly.   I noticed today that I have a tan! It's so cool that I actually tanned!!!! I never thought it was possible. But the downside to this is that I know have two different tan lines. I assume that these tanlines come from wearing different stylings of shirts while on the workcamp trip (i.e. I wore sleeveless one day, a cutoff the next, a wifebeater the next, etc.). I look kinda funny though.  I went swimming a little while ago, right after lunch actually so I guess it was actually a few hours ago. Wow does time fly by when you're on the internet. I think I'm gonna start e-mailing my pals from workcamp just so that they know I still remember them (even though I'm sure some of them aren't even home yet).   I'm gonna get going know and read or watch tv or write or draw or something along those BORING lines.   Adios amigos...

      I just got back from group workcamps in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was actually a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. I made a lot of new friends from all over and I also grew closer to a lot of people from Sandusky. It was great.  We worked in groups to help needy people across the city. I was in a group of 6: Myself, Sophia (from Wisconsin), Megan (from Maryland), Cory (from Georgia), Dustin (from Ohio), and our group leader Jennifer, who was in her thirties, from Virginia. It was awesome to meet people from all over. I shared conversations with these Arkansas people who liked listener to my Northern accent. By the end of the week, tho, it was a little more Southern since I was around Southern people so often during the trip.   Some of the people from Sandusky that I made better friends with were Katie Reed, Chelsea Guildenzopf, Justan Horst, Jill Morningstar, Jordan Loding, and just other random people. We seemed to all get along pretty well. When we weren't working we were at this school just outside of Indianapolis and we had seminars and devotions and stuff like that. Free time was my favorite. Then on Wednesday we had a half day and went shopping. Some people went to the mall and others went to the movies, and blah, blah, blah. Shopping people: me, Ashley M, Jordan, Justan, Katie, Andie, Chelsea...Movies: Jill, Beth, Grant, Leslie...Other People who went to other places: Martha, Kathy, Mark.  When we went to the mall we all spent a lot of money...most of us spent all the money we had with us. Ashley Mezo spent about $100, Justan spent like $120 (on 4 things!), and the rest of us all spent about $20. Then we ate out at Stake n Shake. Thats my new fave restaraunt. The shakes are soooooooooooo good. I had a chocolate/vanilla shake. It was delectable.   Overall I had a great time. I also bonded with Leslie who was the girl's chaperone. She's pretty young (about 23 or 24) and we could all talk to her. There were some emotional nights and some really funny ones but altogether I just had a nice time.   Now I'm gonna watch television. Until then...

      Hey there. Right now I'm in California. It's been pretty fun so far and I've been having a pretty good time even though right now I'm pretty pissed off. Just at "certain people" but I won't say who those are. Not yet anyway.  I've seen quite a bit. I'll put it in order for y'all...  Day One: We flew into L.A. from Detroit. Then we went to Anaheim, got a hotel, and went out to supper. After supper we came back to the hotel and watched the Disneyland fireworks because our room looked over all of Disneyland. It was a great view. Then I went back to my cousin Andrew's apartment and my aunt and uncle stayed in the hotel.  Day Two: Got up pretty early and went to Venice Beach. It was fun, I got to put my feet in the Pacific. Then we went to Santa Monica which was BEAUTIFUL. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. We rode on the roller coastar at Santa Monica pier and walked around. Downtown Santa Monica is soooooo nice. I wanna live there someday.  Day Three: BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!! We hiked in Griffith Park to the very top of a mountain where we had a clear view of the Hollywood sign. I actually had fun hiking! I made it up to the top first out of everyone in my group. Then we went to downtown Hollywood. When we were driving down Sunsent Blvd. I saw the club that Johnny Depp owns!!! "The Viper Room" is what its called. Then we went to the Kodak theater which is where they have the Oscars. I sat in Johnny Depp's seat!!!!! It was LOVELY!!!! Then we walked down the Walk of Fame and saw the stars with the famous people's names. Then we went to Mann's Chinese Theater which has all of the handprints outside of it. I put my hands in Judy Garland's, Marilyn Monroe's, and Shirley Temple's. Then I put my feet in Arnold Schwartzinager's, Bruce Willis's, Tom Hanks's, John Travolta's, and Robin Williams's. That was sooooo coool! I took some pics of Drew Barrymore's star on the walk of fame and I even saw two famous people!!!!!! I saw this one lady who was in the movie "Rose Red" at Mann's and then I saw Jojo!!!! She was in the car next to me on the way there.  On this day we also went on the Hollywood homes tour. But we did it ourselves instead of going on the bus cuz we got a Hollywood homes map. I'll list the houses that we saw:  Aaron Spelling The Playboy Mansion Babyface Sheryl Crow Wolfgang Puck Phil Collins Osbournes House!!! (my fave!!!)  Then later on we went to Brentwood which is just outside of Hollywood and went to this one place where we walked around and saw another famous person!!! This was someone I didn't know, but she's from the movie "A Mighty Wind" and she did look pretty familiar.  Day Four: Did some more Hollywood homes tours (actually a lot of these homes weren't in Hollywood, most were in Beverly Hills, some in West Hollywood, some in Westwood, and some in Bel Air). These are the people who's homes we saw this day:  Pauly Shore Leonardo DiCaprio Donatella Versace Tobey Maguire Michelle Lee Keanu Reeves Britney Spears/Brittany Murphy (it was Spears, but she sold it to Murphy) Charlize Theron Winona Ryder Halle Berry Larry Flynt Michael York Ben Stiller Bob Barker Billy Idol  Then we went to the Getty Center which is this big artsy museum thing with plants and photographs and crap like that. It was pretty boring but it had nice views of the entire city.  Day Five: We went to Huntington Beach which is a very cursed place for me!!!!! First I got taken under by this huge wave and almost died, then I got whacked in the back with a surf board and I couldn't breathe for a little bit, then I stepped on a jellyfish, then I cut my arm on a rock, then I got the worst sunburn of my entire life which hurt so bad I couldn't even sit down.  Lets just say I don't like Huntington Beach.  Day Six: We went to Laguna Beach which was pretty bad for me because I had to wear pants and a t-shirt so I wouldn't get more sunburnt. I wanted to go swimming so I wore my shirt in and almost died in the undertow. The waves here were HUGE, the biggest I've ever seen, but only right up at the shore so no one was surfing (thank God). It was okay.  Day Seven: We went to San Diego and went to the zoo. Mostly we just walked around and looked at a bunch of animals and I tried not to get more sunburned. It was pretty fun. I liked our hotel; we had two suites. It was big but I couldn't sleep all night cuz my sister snored.  Day Eight: We went to SeaWorld which was soo much fun. We rode on a roller coaster that got you all wet called Atlantis, then saw a dolphin show, then saw Shamu, then saw a sea lion show (the best) then we went to see a 3D movie which was the scariest thing ever for me cuz I hate those things. In between all that we saw otters, manates, polar bears, penguins and sharks too. It was really fun though.  Day Nine: We went to a Wild Animal Park in San Diego which was pretty cool. I got to feed and pet a giraffe and came pretty darn close to an elephant. It was nice but really hot so everyone was really tired. But I had a somewhat okay day. Then we came back to Anaheim and stayed at my cousin's apartment again and swam and watched "Hellboy" (a really weird movie) and ate Mexican food!!! YUMMY!!!!  Day Ten: That would be today in which we aren't doing anything. I'm on my cousin's computer and everyone is gone to Fries (a big computer store) except for me and my sister. We wanna go swimming later but I don't know if we will. My sunburn is better (it mostly turned to tan) but now on my back it is starting to peel. We leave to come home tomorrow. I'm soooooo ready. Even though California is fun, it's starting to get boring. I miss my friends and my cat and SCHOOL believe it or not. I cannot believe that, but I really do. I wanna see everyone again!!! And now I've actually got good stories to tell everyone!!! and a tan!!!!!  Well, I'm going to go soak myself in juices...
