      Father Lord hear my cry I can't seem to get things right As I look to You I feel so dry Help me Lord to see Your light  As I trod this journey on Earth Lord make me realise the wrong I've done Let me know my every worth  Remind me that I am Your son  O Lord since You've chosen me  I will never let You down A faithful child I will be  Lord give me strength to last the rounds  andrew.

      Lord You seem so far away A million miles or more it feels today And Though I haven't lost my faith I must confess right now, that it's hard for me to pray  * But I don't know what to say   And I don't know where to start   But as You give the grace   With all that's in my heart  ** I will sing, I will praise    Even in my darkest hour    Through the sorrow and the pain    I will sing, I will praise     Lift my hands to honour You    Because Your Word is true    I will sing  Lord it's hard for me to see All the thoughts and plans You have for me But I will put my trust in You Knowing that You died to set me free * **

      As I am trapped in this shadow of darkness Filled with anxiety not knowing what to do Lord please show me Your mighty prowess Give me strength and carry me through  Many a time I feel like giving up Just letting go and never returning But Lord I pray You'll fill my cup Quench my thirst keep my heart burning  And even in my darkest hour I'll remain as firm as can be Lord give unto me Your great power That I may stand by You eternally  andrew.

      Hide me now, Under your wings Cover me, Within Your mighty hand  When the oceans rise and thunders roar I will soar with You above the storm Father You are King over the flood I will be still know you are God  "When I cried out, He answered me, and made me bold with strength in my soul." Psalm 138:3

      Committing my life, my all to You I dont wanna do this all alone Indeed You'll be there when i call To me You'd make Your presence known  Trials and temptations i may face I'll offer them all up to You Take my burdens away from me That I may always start anew  Days are numbered as they go by Destruction is widespread, people die Save us from this sinful world Show us Your mercy, hear our cry  andrew.

      I'll never know how much it costs To see my sin upon that cross  Here I am to worship Here I am to bow down Here I am to say that You're my God  Even when things are looking blue I'll never hesitate to look to You Cos' I know You'll be there for me To strengthen me and pull me thru'  asean schools sounded damn fun when i heard frm the ppl who went. too bad im so lousy i cant even smell the airplane exhaust when it takes off. i feel like im wasting my time in school. in track. i wanna move on. but where to..? dang.
