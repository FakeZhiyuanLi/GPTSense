      It seems that I am missing 3 hours from a humanities class.  This, plus the 12 hours I'm already having to take to graduate will be a real bummer.  My only hope is to find a class that will sub in its place.  I know when I registered last semester, I had this humanities class mess fixed.  I guess I'll be going back over transcripts to find out what subs there again.  :-(

      Ok, so I've nearly made it to the end of the week.  I think I almost died about 45mins ago.  I had to go to the dentist for a regular checkup.  Everything went fine until she came at me with the floss.........

      I hope I can make it through the week.  I finally got my network candidate finished late on Monday.  Now I just have to convince the rest of the group to use it :-)  Not that it's the best, but I put a ton of time and effort into it and I don't want that wasted.  SQL test tonight and then I should be set for the rest of the week.  Maybe then we can focus on buying our first house.  Hopefully one that has a yard for the dog!

      My wife and I went out to my buddy's ranch today.  The dog thought he was in heaven.  It was definitely the biggest back-yard he's ever seen.  Anyway, the tanks(people outside of Texas call them 'ponds') are full and I caught a nice size bass.  I'm either doing something wrong or the fish just weren't biting today.  All that matters is that we had a good time.

      One day of Spring Break is already over.  I just realized this will be my LAST Spring Break, unless I decide to go back to school at a later date(doubtful).  After finishing school, I want to concentrate on getting some certifications behind me.

      We got to go to the track meet yesterday.  It was a typical track meet, rainy and cold.  Anyway, we got second in the 800m relay(I think that's the right event).  I would have liked to have seen the field events, but they got rained out.  I don't understand why you can't throw a shot or discus in the rain.....

      Not much going on today.  We'll probably go to my little cousins' track meet this afternoon.  Hopefully it won't be raining.  Speaking of rain, do the weathermen actually have a clue?  They never know when anything will happen....

      The UPS man brought by a nice surprise today.  He brought my new Sony Ericsson T226 cell phone.  I got the Free Upgrade reminder from Sony Ericsson in the mail a few weeks ago and I really didn't think I'd get it.  Nothing is ever free anymore.  We'll see about this one.  My old phone(is 7 months old?) is being donated to my brother.  He wants Bluetooth for his TG50 and I suppose his laptop.  It should be fun for him to use.  Bluetooth really didn't live up to my expectations, maybe it will with him.

      Wow.....  In lab tonight, we found out that during our practical last week, one of our group members accidentally deleted one of our OUs.  That meant that I had to fix this foul-up before we could finish tonight's lab.  So we spent the good part of 45 minutes just getting back to where we should have been in the first place.

      It's Saturday and we've seen all kinds of houses this weekend.  Some were good, some were old, and others smelled like old people or dogs......:)  Just kidding...well, not really.  We have about 3-4 homes that we really like but one had an offer made today!  It's a really nice 3 bedroom with a small yard and the dork that was there before us apparently liked it too.  Oh well, so goes the house buying problems....

      Well, it's Friday at about 2:20 AM.  We leave at 3AM to get to Austin by 4:30 or 5AM so that we can get through security and get on the plane.  I have yet to go to bed so this will be a very interesting couple of days.  See you on the flipside.  Awake: 16 hours  Note:  I stayed awake about 30 hours total.  I cheated and slept about an hour on the plane.

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while.  It's been a very hectic two weeks.  Classes are closing up and we've been talking with realtors and mortgage people.  We fly out Friday to NC to go and look at some houses.  I hope I get to sleep this weekend.  I've got 4 tests between Monday and Tuesday of next week, 2 assignments, 2 projects and a lab practical that are all due on or before Tuesday as well.  Oh well, there's plenty of time to sleep when you're dead.....

      The whole class thing got worked out yesterday.  It seems I do have all the hours I need.  I've never met an advisor that knows what he/she is doing.  Why do they always put the dumbest people in the most important situations in your life?  When you have a baby, do they call in the garbage man to deliver it?(not that garbage men are stupid-they just don't know anything about being a Dr.)  Anyway, it looks like I'm set to graduate this summer.  It will be so nice to be able to go to work, come home, and have no homework!  Oh, and then there's the whole money thing.  They actually pay you to go to work, unlike school....

      In a little more than 24 hours, Sam will be a doctor!  Although I'm not terribly excited about the dinner tonight, it will be nice to see family and friends.  I only hope we can stay in touch with all of them over the coming years(friends that is).

      Only two days left until Sam is officially a doctor....  I just can't believe it.  One, I can't believe it's already been four years.  Two, she'll be a doctor....a real doctor.  She is way smarter than I'll ever be and I'm so proud of her!  Updates and pictures to follow!

      The house situation seems to be going well.  We will close in late May.  Now I just have to survive moving again.  We are starting the packing situation and there is junk all over our apartment.  The dog is crazy because he has no idea what's going on.  He's scared of all the boxes and everything that we get out of closets.  With any luck, we'll be completely packed and ready to go by late next week or early the following week.
