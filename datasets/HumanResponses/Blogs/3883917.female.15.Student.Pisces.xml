      A lot has happened since I wrote my last entry, which I wrote on Wednesday I think...hmm, idk. Well anyway, Thursday I slept most of the day b/c I was up until four in the morning with Lilo, Tay and Amanda and then woke up at seven, Thursday night I went to High Point *claps hands like a retart* ...Friday I hung out with Nick until I had to work, and the interesting stuff starts on Saturday. I woke up around nine, of course I set my alarm because I'm lazy and usually wake up around ten or eleven...but whatever, my dad said we can't wake up that late because we just don't "function right as a family" or whatever, I kinda see what he's saying but come on...I'm fifteen...So anyway, I wander around outside and shit until it's like ten thirty, so then I take a shower (the whole process of clothes hair and makeup takes about an hour and a half) so around eleven thirty I'm done with all that shit and I go and call Nick to see what's up and if we're hanging out. It was Chrissy and Mike's fourteenth birthday so duh I was going to be there before Nick and I had to be at work...so I go to his house and help clean and stuff (for some reason their house is really fun to clean) but before that him and I were in his yard whistling with the grass in our fingers (anyone who's never done that was deprived as a child). So anyway his mom rushes out of the house with the "WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON" look on her face, she's like "What were you guys doing?" And I held up a blade of graass and she's like "Oh, I thought you guys killed a bird or something..." yeah for some reason I found that really funny. So anyway, it's like four now and people start showing up (Mike's band, Chrissy's friends and a bunch of relatives)...at the time Nick and I were upstairs with Chrissy and her friends, sitting in her room (he was shittin around with her new guitar) but once they left we came up with the bright idea of throwing this HUGE inflatable palm tree out her bedroom window (it's three stories high and it faces the backyard, where everyone was) oh MAN that was so funny and then Kathy thought Chrissy did it so she yelled at her, oh man  good times  so anyway now we're on our way to work and we realize that it's&nbsp;a WEEKEND GAME and we were supposed to be there at three, so we were two hours late...our boss wasn't so pissed but well my parents were, so for some odd reason they drive me back to Nick's for some more of the party, he talked to Haley on the phone (read the first entry, she's 18) or whatever the fuck was going on (I really just don't care anymore) idk his aunt called him up the hill (we were having a "love" moment down by the lake with the sunset) and he's just all happy OH YEAH HALEY'S ON THE PHONE and shit...it seemed like he was nervous about it too, but then when I was talking to his aunt (Haley's mother) while them two were on the phone he kept pulling me closer for God knows what reason, kinda contradicting if you ask me but I really don't care. So later on we cuddle on the couch and stuff and then my mom came, everything seemed okay at first but then she started screaming about me for being late to work and well uhh I had already taken the heat and stuff, she had me to the point where when we pulled into my driveway I was in tears and she thought I was "playing games" with her or whatever, but finally my dad talked with me and everything got fixed. You can never depend on having a talk with my mom without feeling like ripping her head off in the end, nothing EVER gets solved I swear...then yesterday (Sunday if you're a retart) we all went to Water Carnival and had a pretty good time, it made me completely forget about Haley and everything but oh well. It actually didn't hit me again until a minute ago, I don't know why...damn, I'm like gonna break down right now. I don't know why it's bothering me so much, it didn't before...this like came out of nowhere. I'll write more when I get over this...

      I know every once in a while I'll comment on how my relationship with Nick is going...and depending on my mood and what's going on in my life (even if it has nothing to do with him) it could be really nice or really heart-breaking. Like every other relationship, we've got some quirks to work out and knots to untie...who doesn't? And I personally think we have an awesome relationship compared to some of the other ones I know of. We love and respect eachother so much, we trust in God to make our relationship (and hopefully, someday, our marriage) exactly what he wants it to be, we make healthy decisions together, and we always put the other one first. I felt, until two days ago, that there was  still  something missing. I wasn't sure what it was, and it didn't bother me too much until I couldn't just casually talk to him anymore. Whatever it was ...it was getting in the way of us talking, which is the necessity in every relationship...especially ours. I couldn't talk to him without saying something that I truly didn't mean or something I'd regret later. Somehow he has enough power (and passiveness, which isn't a good thing) within himself to still be loving and understanding towards me when there's something wrong with me or our relationship. Two nights ago, he finally talked to me, and let everything out. (Which, quite honestly, I'd been waiting a few months for.) He told me exactly how he felt about everything I do (no details really, he spoke in general). One of the only things he felt that we'd be better off if I changed was if I would stop holding him back from doing stupid stuff. If any of you know Nick personally, you know he's had at least eight or nine near-death experiences in his life (irronically none since we've been dating), and when he told me that, even though it was before we were going out and I was still with someone else... I wanted to do all I could to stop him from doing anything that could kill him.  He's been in car accidents, bike accidents, his lungs almost failed him a few times, he almost fell out of a window when he was a baby...everything near-death I could think of he had already experienced. So much as him sliding down the railing of a stair case scared me. But he helped me remember that, him being a little rascal&nbsp;that he is was one of the many reasons I fell for him in the first place. Every dumb risk-taking little thing he did in front of me took my breath away (and believe me, to this day I don't know why) ...but why would I try to take that away from him? I've come to realize he's been more so much more cautious and he values life&nbsp;so much&nbsp;more since November when I decided to finally be with him, and it hit me that  I don't have to worry  so much about him anymore. There's still a huge piece of me who wants to hold him tight and keep him from anything that could hurt him, but if it's who he is to&nbsp;get out there and take chances all of the time, why would I try to take that away from him? I love him so much, I've been in love with him for a while now...and that's one of the  biggest&nbsp; treasures  God has sent to earth for me, I'm not going to risk losing it. I'd like to try to keep him safe, but I also want him to be happy. So that's one thing I'm working on at the moment, along with being a better daughter and a more caring and understanding to my environment and the people who I live with/choose to live with (my friends) and such...I know it's going to take a lot of time, energy and prayer, I wasn't born the nicest person...but there's nothing God can't fix. Anyone who reads this, please pray for me...I'd like to be a better person in the eyes of God, and I can't do that without prayer. And remember, two people in prayer sends 10,000 angels in flight...(as opposed to 1000 for one person) so yeah. Thanks for reading, and praying if you did. I'll write more when something comes up. PEACE!

      I came home from camp Friday night. I have to say, it was pretty awesome. So many things happened that I thought were impossible. (And that excludes myself walking on a tightrope.) My favorite day was Thursday...which wasn't all that great in itself, but the service that night was amazing. The praise and worship in the beginning was cool and everything, but it really wasn't much different from all the other nights (except for Joe Cala break dancing *melts on the floor*) the service was so boring...everyone was seriously  falling asleep  in their seat. (And we were sitting in folding chairs, so they weren't that comfortable. That's how tired everyone was.) The service ended around 11, and usually by that time we all go back to our cabins, chill out for another hour and lights out at midnight. (11:59 actually. Don't ask.) But the band got up and started playing another song...and then another song...and then another song... about the fourth song I actually started getting into it again. Two singers from the band fell to the floor, after about 5 minutes of shaking and praying. That's  never  happened before, the band falling down...not even at the retreat in March. Everyone with the small exception of me and a few others were paying attention; everyone else was falling asleep (litterally) on the floor and whatnot. One of the camp guys (strong Christian) came up to the front, and just started talking...slowly everyone's heads lifted up, "I'd like to teach you something tonight. Matthew 26:40 says 40Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. 'Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?' he asked Peter. 41'Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.' The glory of God is in this place tonight. Your flesh wants to fall asleep on the floor, but your spirit wants to say here. The only thing Moses ever asked of God was to see his glory. This was because Moses had seen  everything  else. He saw the burning bush, a defeated Pharoh, the part of the Red Sea, the only thing left for him to experience was the glory of God. At the time, for whatever reason *i can't remember it* God couldn't show Moses his glory. In Matthew 26:40, God showed his glory to Jesus and the two disciples. The two disciples, being flesh unlike Jesus, could not keep awake. They could have seen something so amazing that night." And I knew at that moment what it meant. All of my peers and I had the chance that very night to experience the glory of God. What a privilege. Something even Jesus' disciples themselves couldn't stay awake for. I won't say what happened after that. I left in tears, I'll say that much. But that night, I knew for sure  I had experienced the glory of God.  It was the craziest/most wonderful thing I've ever felt, heard and seen.&nbsp; That's&nbsp; my camp memory, people. The ride home from camp the next day was awesome. My mom was stressed out because she got lost finding the camp to pick us up, I was stressed because of things I won't mention...but we found out Vinny was gonna be in our car, I was like "Oh God..." but he was like the funniest thing I've ever seen. Him and Steve (Steve is one of the nicest kids I've met since Nick) were putting my lotion on their legs (it smelled like girl stuff) and imitating comercials off TV. Vinny fluffed up the hair on his legs and's like "Yeah, the chicks dig this..." And he'd call Kyle on the cell and be like "Oh Kyle I want you so bad...at the next rest stop you have to feel my legs." And at the rest stop they were poll dancing together...God, it was great. Camp was awesome; I can't wait until next year. I'll never forget the friends I made, the lessons I learned or how horrible the food was. Thanks, to my friends, my parents and God for making it a week away from home worthwhile. Yesterday, Nick and I had some problems...but we talked and we're okay now (problems after 3 weeks of not seeing eachother...wow, that's unheard of) I still feel a little weird about the whole thing, I know it's nothing serious but I just want this feeling gone. Well, I'm gonna bounce...thanks for reading, I'll write another entry when something important happens. PEACE.

      It's quite amazing, but Nick and I are more than fine...hard to explain but I promise I will when I get back from camp. I'm living in about five hours and coming back Friday night. It's not going to be too much fun...but hey, at the moment I really need God and I know it's not true but I feel like I lost him over the past month or so because of some dumb stuff that went on. When I come back, I'll find some time to write an entry on, first, what happened with Nick and why it's okay now, and then about camp. A GIGANTIC thank you to all of my friends who helped me this week...Tay, Allycia, JJ, Chris, Ben, Kurt (yes even you), Dani, Christa, Sarah, and Diana...just for diving into the fight just to make things better again. It worked. I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH, I didn't know I had so many friends until this week when you all helped me out...thanks for the prayers, the listening sessions, the advice, the hugs, EVERYTHING. Well, I'm off to camp, PEACE!!

      I'd say it's a strange title for a first entry, but I suppose it fits. My boyfriend Nick has been in North Carolina for a week now. I've been doing okay with it, keeping myself occupied with chores, work, redoing my room (and actually moving into a new one), shopping, ect. He's in this huge beach house with his family, some relatives and a few friends of his parents who also have kids. Kids. Sure. They're girls who are 16 and 18 years old. (I knew this is what it would be like before he even left.) He told me I could trust him down there, and that I wouldn't have to worry about him.  Before he left, he gave me his cologne because he said he wouldn't need it where he was going to be. I left my bag at his house that day, so after he left I went to his house to go pick it up...it had a short love letter and a burnt CD with all of our songs on it. He has called me every night so far, and everything seemed pretty okay. He bought me a bunch of stuff, he's always whipping out our picture and telling people about me...whatever. Well, last night, he calls me...of course in an area where there's almost no reception (which I have to say after a while I was beginning to enjoy) telling me how him, his brother and one of the girls sleep in a room together...how they walk on the beach at night together, and how they stay up until 5 in the morning together. The whole however long we were on the phone, he talked about them. It was all about those preppy bitches. Needless to say, I was upset. I just sat there and faked every last "I love you" and "I miss you", while on the verge of tears, and at the same time trying not to freak out on him on the phone. So after we got off, I'd say it was around 10:30, I went online to talk to my friends about it. Since my circle of friends (I must say) is very unique, I got different responses from all of them...irronically (that was sarcastic) contemplating each's personality. Christa was all laid back about it, "Eh, he's having a good time...when he comes back just do something to turn him on and make him happy so he'll forget about them." Sarah was all "GOD GOD GOD GOD GOD GO TO GOD FOR HELP GOD GOD GOD" down my throat, Dani goes all spiteful on me "Oh, I get NO credit at all I give you help for all of your guy problems blah blah blah" I wasn't mad at any of them, because well they ARE my friends and like I said their responses are their personalities...the reason why I became friends with them. I finished a conversation with my friend Joey about it (who kept coplaining about being single)...he helped me out a lot. After talking to all four of them, I made a decision not to answer his calls for the next two nights (and after that I'm going to summer camp for a week, so I won't talk to him or see him there either) just to give me time to cool off. That night, I took everything that reminded me of him...the stuffed animals, his sweatshirt, his cologne, I put it all outside my door just so maybe I'd be able to sleep that night. (Which I didn't anyway, but that's besides the point.) I took his necklace off of my neck (he lets me wear it) and dropped it right into the lizards cage. I turned all of our pictures around, took the CD out of my CD player and broke it, I did everything I could. I woke up in a little bit better mood, but still hadn't changed my mind about what I was going to do. As long as I get through today without answering the phone, I'll be okay. Tomorrow I'm gone all day, Tay's sleeping over, and then we're going to church and then to camp from there together. I told my sister Karissa about the whole thing (b/c we're like best friends) and I kinda joked around with it to make us BOTH feel better (she had a hard time with some stuff she was trying...she's also working on letting go of this one guy she's liked for a long time who just moved)...I went into my room to take some pictures down from the walls (I stated before I was moving into a different room) and every one of him I took down...I don't know, it was the strangest thing...I didn't feel anything. I turned on the radio, and ironically in the matter of 3 hours all of our songs on that CD played (between the two stations I listen to.) I keep thinking about it, I just can't get it off my mind. To be completely honest, I don't know if I'm learning from this, or if it's driving me crazy...

      The title has almost nothing to do with the entry...in my mind it does but well because I'm lucky enough that you can't read it you wouldn't understand it. Anyway, enough with the nonsense (litterally)...lately  I've been walking the narrow path with a broken legs and a few injured friends.  Diana's switching schools, Sarah's having problems with Dan that he doesn't even know about yet, Bryan doesn't even know Dani exists on this earth...one of my best Christian friends is now dating a pothead. What has this world come to? *rolls eyes* Diana and I had a very deep conversation last night, about how she's switching schools and how people are starting to forget about her already...and  it sounded so damn familiar , and soon enough my feelings for Vernon and Charter eventually surfaced. I came to realize actually a while ago that my time was up in those places, but I still long for the same surroundings, the same people, even the same noises and feelings...I get chills just wondering how I ended up here, in this place. I know I would never go back for good; I've accepted the fact that I might be spending the rest of my life out of my comfort zone.  Who says I won't learn to like it and learn from it?  Haha, me of course. Just kidding, but I'm still having a hard time accepting what God handed to me. I know it isn't, but  it feels like it's too much for me.  I know God would never do that to me, it still feels like way too much on my part....eh, I'll eventually get over it. Nick's on the phone, we might hang out today, so I'll rite more later.

      I just read through (kinda skimmed actually) all of my entries...I probably sound like a skitzo. May I clear that up? Thank you. Very few of you (I have to say only members of the female sex) know that I take everything to an extreme. Even if it's already extreme, I feel the need to take it more extreme. (And I'm asking for specific prayers for that.) I still do and always have loved Nick through everything we went through...and every situation was magnified if you heard it from me. *Hides behind a rock*...I don't know how he puts up with me every hour of every day. This week there were a lot of ups and downs for me when it came to our relationship. I kept most of it hidden, I told some to Aaron (but I'll get to that in a minute.) Monday Nick and I went to see the Village...I was expecting it to be all scary, a movie where I'd have to hold on to him and  bury my head in his shoulder to muffle the screams , but well that didn't happen. It actually really sucked. But I still had a really good time; we checked out the little stores in the town and went out for pizza before the movie. And we bought some Big Red at Right Aid *big smile* ...Monday was a good day. Kelly decided at her first football practice that she wanted to quit. *shrugs* not my problem. Anyway, Tuesday my mom and I went shopping...and then I found out (for the second time actually...he told me a week before that but I forgot about it) That he was having this two night sleepover with his band and then going to the fair with them on Friday (because they were playing there). I was kinda upset and stuff because I wouldn't talk to him much or be able to see him at all, but I lived with it. He had a pretty good time there and realized how many friends he really  did  have. Tay and I arrived at the fair at noon for him (but by the time we found him it was like 12:30) I was so happy to see him...we hung out a lot of the day, he played "Slide" for me,  he won me a huge plush turtle  from one of the stupid carni-games...we just had a really good time. And while his band was playing, I was like smiling ear to ear...and then Aaron yells in my ear (because yeah it was that loud and it sounded like a whisper) "And YOU were dissappointed when you found out he was in a band." (That was the thing I talked about with him)...I was so proud of him, he did so good...his voice got a little scratchy and stuff, but other than that he did awesome. He left early so we only hit a few rides...one of them we did together was the zipper, and at one point when it went upside down we kissed and it was pretty cool...he had to go home early but we still had a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, we have to go to church and work but we still get to hang out for a few hours. I feel like we really need it. I think we're at the point in our relatioinship where we're growing so much together, but we're doing so much we don't have time to talk about it. So some down-time tomorrow (which we haven't had since like May or June) will be good for the both of us, but we'll see how it works out. Evertime I look at him, or even it's so powerful where I just have to think about him and it feels like I need to have his arms around me. Like I need to be protected by him from anything I'm afraid of. To feel his strong arms around me, keeping me from anything that could hurt me.  It's an awesome feeling , except for the part that the only time I think about it is when he's not there. Okay, enough of the mushy talk. I got a turtle on Wednesday and I lost it somewhere in my house. Actually, I think my dog ate it but no one in my family agrees with me. Oh well, I'm still praying that I find him alive but I don't think that's gonna happen. He just like disappeared while I was taking a nap. Well anyway, It's almost nine...I just got back from Lori's house and I think I'm gonna call Nick. PEACE!
