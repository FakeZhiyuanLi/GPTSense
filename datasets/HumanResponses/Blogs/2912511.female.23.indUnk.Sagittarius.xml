      so it's come to my attention that you have to have a password to comment.  what's that all about? i didn't make up a password. but i'm on it. i'll figure it out eventually!  until then just email me and let me know whats up i guess. and asha - we still need to chat!  i got it worked out - but just make sure you put your name on the post cause i guess you have to post it anonymously. so i want to know who you are when you say something!

      hey everyone. this is the first day of summer break for the kiddies.  they both have playdates this morning though. and tomorrow and friday i am OFF cause the family is going into DC for the weekend! so i'm pumped about getting to sleep in and relax in the middle of the week. then next week starts camps and swim teams and fun times.  only 9 days till i get back to ohio. i will be in columbus from 9pm friday night until around 3 or 4 on saturday. brent and i have to get back for his friend's 4th of july party.  it's this really big deal.  and then brent and i are volunteering at camp on sunday for registration!!! i keep forgetting we are doing that, but luckily brent remembers. alright, time for my shower and then off for the day of running around with the munchkins! love you all

      so summer is getting here. the kids only have 3 more days of school! then i'm not sure how i'm going to fit int the laundry and the grocery shopping while being with the kids at the club all day. i'm sure i'll figure it out but it might take a week or two of trial and error.  only 15 days till i get to go home to ohio then on vacation with brent and his family! i'm so excited!

      hey everyone. today has been a rainy day. the kids are either at school or a dr's appointment so i'm doing the kids laundry and trying to get some reading done.  i still need to DESPERATELY do my laundry, but who knows when that will happen.  my friend cassi may be coming to ohio with me when i come in for tabi and jordan's wedding.  brent probably will be working still during the wedding so cassi will probably be my date. i'm excited for her to meet all my friends and see where i lived.  but that all depends on what her job situation is like. so she might not be able to come in then, but hopefully sometime.  not much else is going on. i'm hoping to take the kids to the zoo sometime next week since they are done with school on tuesday and dont start their camps and swim team till the following week.  i may be getting a haircut but i'm not completely decided yet and cassi and i are starting a one-on-one study - we are reading mere christianity first and then we'll go on to another book. let me know how you all are doing! (MORGAN - i got the invite to your party but sadly i will be in connecticut - or i was depending on when the party is ... i forget ... but thanks for the invite!!)

      so there is a hazardous waste day this saturday in greenwich, ct (about 10 minutes from my house) and i just don't get it. what do you do at hazardous waste day?  do the kids get to jump in big piles of hazarous waste? is there bobbing for apples?  are they celebrating hazardous waste or saying we need less of it? well, sorry folks - i know you all want the scoop but i will not be attending hazardous waste day. i will be helping cassi pack. if you could keep her in your prayers that would be great. she is still looking for a job and hasn't had any calls back yet.  she's getting a little anxious.  and she's a really awesome person so she deserves it! all i had to do was mention that i was homesick and she was like "well what are you doing tongiht?" and i was babysitting but she came over after i put the kids to bed and we talked for like an hour just so i didn't feel so lonely.

      so i'm homesick again. i think i just need to get out in the middle of the week.  cause my weekends are great and i'm happy, but during the week i feel really isolated.  i think i am getting out tomorrow night which is good.    i'm trying to get into a workout routine, and it just isn't working. i either want a nap instead (cause that's REAL active) or i am crazy busy with stuff for the family.  but today i am working out! and i'm going to try and join a rock gym, but i think i should wait til after the summer is over cause the kids being out of school wont make for an easy time of me getting to go climbing during the week.  i found one close by but i still have to check it out.    so july 2 i fly into columbus around 9 pm. who's picking me up? and can brent and i stay with someone?  anyone want to do something that night or the next morning before i head up north?

      so asha wants an update on how i'm doing. and since apparently she is the only one who reads this anymore i will appease her. i'm doing wonderful.  i have one really good friend and some other good ones.  i'm getting rides to the airport from these people and it saves me tons of money and gives me good quality time with them.  and i found a service that is almost joshua house.  they have cool worship and relevent talks.  tonight we learned about a christian perspective on women. (they are doing a series on tough topics and it is really good!) i miss everyone like CRAZY but this is starting to feel like it could be home.  cassi is a great friend and friday i think we are going to do a sleepover at my room with movies and food and fun.  our friend sheree is going to come too hopefully.  cassi just got laid off though so pray she gets a good position in the area.  it's not a bad situation (why she lost her job) it's just tough cause this is the 2nd time it has happened to her.  so we are working hard to get her a new job and i am going to help her pack next saturday.  i'm so excited to be making friends that it is going to be hard to leave.    so basically things are going well here, the job is good, but i still miss ohio and the people. still planning on being home around next february unless things change. but i could see myself staying longer just cause i do have friends and am not completely homesick anymore. love you all! let me know if you read this!

      alright, so i woke up at 8:30 this morning (saturday) and was totally rested.  waking up early all week means you can't sleep in on the weekends. grr.  oh well. i'm hanging out with cassi and kysa today.  2 fun people.  it should be good. and tomorrow the kids have their piano recitals so i kinda have to go to that unless i want some sad kids on monday.  and i want to hear them cause they are so cute.  and then i'm helping out with cafe again i guess (according to cassi) at blackrock.  thats the church that is as close to j-house as i will ever get without it being the real thing. it's a young adult service with cool worship and a young pastor.  although the people dont seem as friendly as they do at j-house. but of course i know lots more people at j-house and it's been a while since i was new. and all my friends at j-house welcome any new person they see!  oh well. have a great weekend. hope to hear from you soon!

      so it was SO good to go home for the weekend. brent and i spent the whole weekend together. doing basically nothing but it was just good to see each other.  sorry to the rest of you ohio people that i didnt get to see. i will be in on july 2!  hey - nash's - can brent and i crash at your place that night so he doens't have to drive 5 hours after a week of camp (we will obviously not be sleeping in the same room!) - let me know if thats cool or if i need to find some place else for one or both of us.   being in ohio was good but it was also REALLY good to come home to friends who pick you up from the airport.  it was so nice of cassi (and jill) to drive down to get me.  it was really a blessing cause it saved me almost $100 and i got to spend time with new friends.  keep up the prayer for friends thing. it's coming along nicely but i could use a few more (you like to have options ya know!)  i also got sick this weekend so working today was not so fun.  i went to bed at 9:30 last night and slept for 9 hours and i was still exhausted today but i wasn't tired when i could have taken a nap. then the kids were constantly doing all the things that drive me crazy and i worked overtime.  it wasn't all that bad - it was just a long day. so i'm gonna go check on francesca, dry my hair, and go to bed.

      hey everyone. after an AWESOME week with Brent and his family i am back at work in connecticut.  brent and i went to tennessee to hang out with his parents and brother and his brother's gf.  it was great - even if sean almost killed brent with the boat. that was a little scary but we all lived!  we did a lot of hiking and picture taking.  we also did some rock hounding (i think that's what it's called) with brent's dad and it was actually kinda fun.  we found a ton of ruby's and some other cool stuff!  we also got to just be lazy all week and that was the best part. i didn't have to wake up early and wake up kids. i could just get up whenever my body said it was time.    well i hope all is well with everyone.  i'll see most of you at tabi and jordan's wedding in a month!  can't wait to see everyone all together again.

       alright, so i've been in CT for 5 months now and i FINALLY met some guys to be friends with. this is right after this guy (one of the pastors for sanctuary) spoke at church and he reminds me SO MUCH of john nash that i almost started crying at church cause i missed john and all the other guys so much. so i went to a help day with sanctuary yesterday. we got to clean out this REALLY old and dirty basement. basically we swept up about a ton of dust, dirt, and coal dust and moved lots of old furniture into a dumpster.  then we went and had lunch and helped fix up this really old baptist (i think) church. we did landscaping and scraping paint and stuff. which was great cause the pastor said it would have taken them about 6 months to get all that work done without out us.  so it was great. but the point (besides it being great to help these people) is that cassi and i finally met some guys. we met this great guy danny who we just clicked with and he lives really close to both of us.  so we have a guy friend! we also met this guy chris who is nice but we didn't click as well with him. and then we kinda met this other guy johnel, but that is a story i am not allowed to really tell. all i will say is we met him at Outback -- you can speculate from there cause cassi will kill me if i post that story online.  but we are not exactly sure how that one will turn out - i will keep you posted.   so how is ohio? i have been missing it a lot and i just realized that things will probably never be the same for me in ohio again.  they might be, depending on how life goes, but as things are looking now i dont think things will be like they were - which is really sad cause i miss all of you so much!  i could have been happy living in columbus my whole life... but i guess God has different plans. it's funny how life changes so dramatically sometimes. and you think you can eventually go back to how things were (or at least close to it) but you really can't. it makes me really sad to think that i might never just be able to hang out with you guys (amanda and john, beka, asha, and EVERYONE) again like we used to.   well, i'll be in columbus on friday for tabi and jordan's wedding!!! so i will get to catch up with you all then. i love you guys so much and i miss you like crazy! hope to hear from you soon!
