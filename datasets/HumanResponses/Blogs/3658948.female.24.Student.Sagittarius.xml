      Man. Guess what? I got fired. To be really honest... I'm profoundly relieved. My boss was (and still is) a snotty, manipulative bitch with atrocious spelling and grammar in addition to a massive inferiority complex. My first day off the job I was a little stunned, kinda pissed because I forgot my favorite pen in the office, but otherwise thrilled at my new block of free time. And the freedom has only gotten sweeter.  However, I'm being careful to remain occupied and active despite my unemployment, and not to fall into my old pre-employment "ER" addiction. (No, Noah Wyle or the Croatian guy didn't do it for me; oddly enough, it was "Rocket" Romano, the little snide bald guy that turned my crank. I know, he's old, short, bald, and not even remotely attractive -- or at least, that's what everyone tells ME. I liked him because he was the only non-schmaltzy character on the show, he had those hot little forearms, the best lines ("What's the matter? Is Prince Harry in rehab again?"), and a lovely bald head. To be bald with a gorgeous skull is really something, especially with his bone structure. But hey, I'm over it.) Killing Romano with that stupid helicopter ruined that series forever, even though it was already swirling in the crapper by the time he kicked it.   On Friday I'm supposed to finally get my Desserts for Democracy bake sale off the ground. The proceeds are supposed to go to the John Kerry campaign, but honestly, I don't like him. I don't care how many medals he's won in what situation that I most likely couldn't have done were I in Vietnam; politically, he's a big wuss. The only thing I like about him is his wife -- apparently she's got enough backbone for the both of them. Yes, Howard Dean was too politically inexperienced to maintain frontrunner status, but I don't think Edwards should have dropped out. After Dean, I liked him best. The idea of Dick Gephardt becoming Veep irks me, because then it'll be TWO wussy Democrats in the running, and I am sick to death of seeing my party bend over for the Republicans. I'm thinking long and hard about emigrating to Canada, but I figure, hell, THEY'RE the ones that suck, why should I leave? Also, their version of the neocons may win prime minister elections, thereby ruining that option as well. Hmmmm.

      Thanks for posting. Here's the text of your post, so it's immediately visible to anyone who arrives:  I really don't like Democrats who won't hear dissent such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, Maxine Waters, Charlie Rangel, David Bonior, Nancy Pelosi, Alan Dershowitz, The entire cast of CNN, The entire NBC news organization, the entire news organization of ABC, the entire news organization at CBS, the entire staff of Washington Post, the entire staff of the New York Times, Jimmy Carter, Madeline Albright, John Podesta, Hillary Clinton, Tom Daschle, Chuck Schumer, Jay Rockefeller, Robert Byrd, Ted Kennedy, Dick Durbin, Herb Kohl, John McCain (yeah, he's a Democrat), Jake Reed, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Carl Levin, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Martin Meehan, and many others.  I'd also like to answer your second post, as to why American Indians think we're solely entitled to describe ourselves as Native Americans.  Although I don't feel as though I'm able to adequately answer for ALL American Indians everywhere, it's partly because we're not really Indians - people from India are Indians, and to describe myself as an "Indian" creates a bit of confusion, because no one from my family has roots there. There really isn't a correct term for the tribes who lived here when white people came (if you then decided to call us "tribes," there are tribes in Canada, New Guinea, Mongolia, and other countries, so that, too could be confusing), so "Native American" is the designation that is so far the most accurate. And we consider ourselves entitled to it because that's who we are.  Regarding your first post about Democrats who refuse to hear dissent, I also can't answer for any of the people listed with confidence, because I don't know or represent them. However, I think Tucker Carlson of CNN's Crossfire is a strong conservative, as is Lou Dobbs, Wolf Blitzer, and possibly others I'm forgetting to mention. Have you written to the people you've listed with your views to see if they've agreed or disagreed? Since you just left those two posts, I'm not sure entirely what your views are, or if I'd wholly disagree with all of them.  The reason why I listed those people is because their hatred and intolerance toward those they disagree with scares me. When Ann Coulter says, "We should invade their country, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity," or that every brown-skinned man should be regarded suspiciously, it goes against the principles the Bill of Rights and Constitution were founded on, and reminds me of the scary period in our history when the U.S. Cavalry systematically slaughtered Native American Tribes during throughout the 1800's during the period of Western expansion. When Tom DeLay, a.k.a. "The Hammer" comes down on fellow Republicans for stepping out of what he views as the party line for Republicans, that scares me. Why does he have so much power in Congress? What ruling entitled him to it?  There are Republicans I like and occasionally agree with, such as Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas (thanks for the apology, and your efforts to get it passed in Congress), Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska for calling 'em as he sees 'em, and yes, John McCain. He's not a Democrat because he has a spine and votes with his conscience -- he's a Republican because he believes in fiscal responsibility, opposes abortion and supports the NRA anmong other things. And Olympia Snowe rocks, too.  As Paul Wellstone said, "Politics is not about left, right, or center. Politics is not about money or power games, or winning for the sake of winning. Politics is about the improvement of people's lives, lessening human suffering, advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and in the world." Through their efforts in the House and Senate, most politicians have proven him right. But by hating those that disagree with them, screaming over their opinions during televised debates and backroom arm-twisting, pundits and politicians such as Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich and others are bringing this basic notion into question.  And if you do ever write Tom DeLay, ask him how his shelter for disadvantaged kids is going. Last I heard, it was just an empty lot overgrown by weeds.

      This blog will someday accompany my cartoon website when I get it up and running (I lack access to a scanner, but trust me, it'll happen).  It's not that I don't like Republicans; in fact, I'm related to a few of them, and the ones I've met are pretty nice. It's just the really hard-core ones that scare me (Tom DeLay, Bush administration, Ann Coulter....blah blah blah), particularly the ones that refuse to hear dissent and really, really hate dirt-poor minorities like me.  Anyway, post when you find me (even if it's bad, but if you fuck up your spelling, expect to be made fun of), and come on back when you can.

      Courtesy of The Hamster (www.the-hamster.com) by Eric Hananoki, here's a scary excerpt of Michael Savage bloviating for Bush:  SAVAGE: You know something; I'm voting for Bush, I just made up my mind. There's nothing in this for me. I'm a white male, I'm a white, male, married heterosexual -- I don't want the Democrats. Everywhere I turn, there's another hot coal in my eye. For example, today's DNC calendar of public events included lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender meeting, the disability meeting, the ethnic meeting, the American Indian meeting, the Asian/Pacific Islander meeting, the Hispanic meeting, and the African American meeting -- God bless 'em, they're entitled to their meeting, I'm entitled to my vote, they're not my party, end of story. And that's it. I'm not voting for a party of ethnic minorities and women and immigrants. I will not do it. And if I thought for a moment that they had changed their direction, if I thought for a moment there was a new Democrat Party that was more centrist and more focused on the real issues of today, I would have considered, well, maybe sitting the election out, or voting for Kerry -- no, I'm not.  ME: Obviously, not all Republicans are this fucking creepy. But why haven't any prominent Republicans made media statements disavowing Savage's blatant Nazi views? "I'm not voting for a party of ethnic minorities and women and immigrants." Who does this freakshow think he is? He's descended from immigrants. I guess you can't really expect any actual logic from pundits and radio personalities, but dammit, he went too far. What is even more frightening is that this guy has thousands of fans who are overwhelmingly young, white, and male. Thousands of 'em.

      I recently returned from a week-long vacation in the Washington-Idaho panhandle area, specifically in Seattle at my sister's apartment and at the Coeur d'Alene reservation, where her husband is enrolled. Before actually seeing Seattle, I assumed it would be a city full of hippes and yuppies and not much else; I was right about the hippies and yuppies, but Seattle is beautiful in its own right, and well worth the trip. What I liked about it was the widespread tolerance toward dogs. I was surprised at how many stores allowed dogs inside, and it seemed like every other person on the street had a dog with them. Even in Barnes and Noble (a huge, two-story building -- ohhhh yeeeeaaahh), a number of dogs were sprawled beside their owner's chairs or snuggled in their laps while they read.  Pike's Market was overwhelming, but fascinating. Apparently it has three levels, but I only got to see one. The major drawback are the public bathrooms, which are unbelievably gross and always have long lines in front of them. I guess that's not surprising, because the market itself is a crush of people and vendors. The brief glimpses of fruit, fish, flowers, vegetables, etc. that I was able to see amid the crowd looked better than what you'd typically find in a supermarket, especially the flowers. They were arranged in big, satisfying bunches wrapped in white paper, with dahlias the size of grapefruits mixed with various other lush, varicolored flowers I couldn't put a name to. I didn't get to see the guys throwing the fish around like I'd hoped to because there was an enormous crowd around that area, but oh well.  The thing about Seattle I found a little difficult was its lack of the usual fast food restaurants. On practically every other block you can find a Thai restaurant, and there are various other small-business restaurants as well that you can't find anywhere else. That's cool, but if you're trying to haul ass to the airport and you want a sausage egg McMuffin, you're screwed. Yes, I'm all for breaking down the fast food monopoly in favor of healthier eating and a better climate for small businesses, but dammit, I'm a North Dakotan and I want my meat and potatoes. If I stayed there longer, I most likely would have adapted to some extent, but hell, sometimes you need a little grease.  Which brings me to Dick's. One night, my sister and her husband took me out to see "Anchorman" in Spokane (It was fucking hilarious. All those pompous movie reviewers who graded it a C+ really need to loosen up. I give it an A. My favorite part was when Paul Rudd -- I forget his character's name -- put on that jaguar cologne and everyone in the office started retching and heading for the door. "It smells like a used diaper full of Indian food!" "It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair!" "It smells like Bigfoot's dick!" Ahhh hahahaha. Anyway, the other movies I'm excited about seeing are "The Village" and that Exorcist prequel), and afterward took me to Dick's for a snack because everything else was closed. It was just like McDonalds, but nothing had been microwaved and therefore it's a little bit better. I'm guessing they hadn't changed the frying grease in awhile, though. My brother in law said that there are two Dick's in Seattle, and that everyone went there to graze at night. Dick's is extremely cheap. The burgers are about 69 cents each, and it seems like a retro-70's establishment. However, it looks like it would really suck to work there.  Coeur d'Alene (northern Idaho) is also really pretty, but in a pleasant, uncrowded, rural way, unlike Seattle. There's a big lake on their reservation, and the mountains are much smaller than the ranges surrounding the reservation. It was extremely relaxing after Seattle, but the real entertainment value was listening to my brother-in-law go off about tribal politics on his reservation. Actually, the politics on my rez are slightly worse, but I can practically guaruntee that every reservation has a few crazies installed in key areas of tribal government that make life miserable for damn near everyone else.  Anyway, it was fun. I never got around to the Coeur d'Alene pow-wow, but my brother-in-law says that there are very few vendors there, which is my main reason for going to pow-wows. I mostly like to check out the jewelry and beadwork, and occasionally eat an Indian taco, if it's worth it. Yeah, the dancing is fun to watch, too, but I prefer to move around and shop.

      Fortunately, I found a place to live off-campus, but comfortably close by. Unfortunately, it's in a skeevy part of the city, and I've yet to see how clean it is. It's a one-room efficiency apartment, partially furnished with a security lock on the outside of the apartment. I doubt anything bad would happen, especially since&nbsp;I've resolved to be a lot more serious about college this time around. I'm trying to&nbsp;see my shitty neighborhood as incentive to get my ass home at a decent hour, so hopefully that'll stave off any weird incidents.  John McCain has been appearing on a string of talk shows recently; a few nights ago it was Jay Leno, before that, the Daily Show, that putz Tim Russert, etc. Despite his evident lack of&nbsp;improvisational humor, he's still a guilty pleasure. I've never seen McCain in full throttle, but stories from my brother-in-law (he was once involved in Indian gaming politics in Arizona, and has now moved back to his own rez) indicate his tantrums are really something to see. He's got that rare mix of guts and principles that I love to see in a politician, but I guess everybody has to play the game at some point. It's not the blatant lie, "I'd really like to see Bush get re-elected" that gets me, it's the footage of him during the Bush/Cheney ad that makes me ill, and his campaign appearances with Cheney that send me scurrying to the bathroom. Yeeeeech. As has been often stated in the media and exemplified in Cheney's own behavior (i.e., telling Leahy to fuck himself), he's an evil, conniving, inhuman prick -- can't McCain see that?? McCain's Wikipedia entry shows a picture of him in navy dress whites accepting his medals on crutches, his hair prematurely grey and his legs nearly folding beneath him. Contrast that with Cheney's statement regarding his activities during the Vietnam War ("I had&nbsp;more important&nbsp;things to do," or something along those lines), and it seems almost obscene that he's letting himself be pandered to the voting public in this way, with these people. I don't doubt his courage, integrity, or any of his other qualities&nbsp;that turned me into a secret McCainiac, but I do wonder why he's falling in with those freakshows.  Oh well. He's human, I guess, and even Paul Wellstone had his flaws.  Still...
