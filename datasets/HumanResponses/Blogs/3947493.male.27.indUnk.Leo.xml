            Where to begin?  How about at the beginning and when I get to the end, I'll stop.      Sounds  urlLink Logical , no?                        Well, my oldest friend, Travis, said to Blog and they will come.  Who they   are   and why they would want to hear what is in my mind I do not know. I guess they are you. I am not sure what I am going to write. However, if you like it, say so. If you don't, say so. I  urlLink promise  that everything you read will be true, and that is about the only thing I can promise. Therefore, here goes something that I never thought I would do...

        I thought I should start my and your journey into my world with a little clarification or background.       I grew up in   urlLink Georgia  , spent the first 21 years of my life there, now I live in   urlLink Las Vegas  .          BIG DIFFERENCE!        The West is no where as nice as the South in my humble opinion. Sure, there is more to do out here. However, it is not as personal. The pace is too fast. The people are not as friendly. Even Nature itself seems to be a little empty. I guess since I live in the desert that could be the reason for that. Don't get me wrong, the mountains out here are beautiful. They are my saving grace. I just miss the richness of the woods and the history that seems to envelop almost every inch of the South. In the South you can drive down almost any major road and see historical markers, I have yet to see one out here. I have no family out here, except for my wife, and few friends. I guess that is why I named my Blog what I named it.       Let's talk about my wife. She is wonderful. She is the most honest and good person I have ever known. She loves Vegas. She grew up here. Her family is here. Her lifelong friends are here. She wants to be here. She sucks. *Just kidding* We have been married for almost a year. I will say right now, marriage is great, but hard. I think that is what makes it so worthwhile. Don't you think that most things in life that bring the most fulfillment and joy take some work? My wife and I truly love one another, but have two different homes. That is going to take some work. I know that my world is with her. I know that life would feel broken without her. She is the reason for my journey.       I ask you, dear readers, how do I make the place I live my home? Is it possible? Am I being selfish? Perhaps, as I write in this forum both you and I will find out.

         Well, yesterday was my birthday. 27 years old! God, I am now in my late 20s. Time it does a pass. I can say, however, that I have done things that I have I wanted to do. Yet, there is so much more.       I have been  urlLink Hang Gliding  over Lookout Mountain. I have Parasailed over the Gulf of Mexico. I have yet to go 2.7 seconds on a bull named  urlLink Fu-Manchu , sorry  urlLink Tim McGraw  moment there. I found my soulmate, hence my wife. I found my kindred spirit, hence Sarah. And I found my best/oldest friend, hence Kid_Lysol. I have performed on stage in High School and College. I have held a job as a DJ for numerous radio stations. However, I still feel a little incomplete. Want to know why? Well, I will tell you anyway.       No kids. I still have not created life with my Audra. I truly feel that something is missing without a little rug-rat around. I mean, I need to pass on some knowledge to someone. Honestly, my wife and I have thought about it. However, we are waiting to when we buy a house. What do you think about these names? For a girl, Rylynne. For a boy, Cohen. These are the ones we like. I really feel that God has kept me on the Earth for this reason. He wants me to have children. God could have taken me a few times by now, and yet I still live. He must have a plan.       Anyway, my birthday went pretty well. My wife took me to  urlLink Nine Steakhouse  at the  urlLink Palms . Good stuff! 12-Ounce Filet, yummy! Plus, she wore a red dress that would make a  urlLink blind man  blush. I only wish I had a picture of her in it. Of course, if I posted it she would kill me. Then the last paragraph would never come true. Sorry, dear hetero male or lesbian readers. By the way, my wife looking as beautiful as she did last night reminded me of why I moved out to Vegas.       If anyone wants to hear something different check out  urlLink Ben Folds . No, it does not sound like his song "Brick". Give it a shot!

       *Spoiler Alerts*         If you are planing of seeing  urlLink "The Village" , then do not read this post!        Okay, so yesterday I went to see  urlLink M. Night Shyamalan's  newest attempt to prove he is not a "One Hit Wonder".  Well, this does not prove it.  Some may disagree and say that "Signs" was great, but they will not convince me of that.  However, since we live in America that is your right.  God bless you and your voice! For me, I felt the acting was contrived and forced.  The only silver lining was,  urlLink Bryce Dallas Howard .  Funny thing, she did not even audition...Mr. S just talked to her and said I want you.  He chose wisely. (Just for fun, click  urlLink here . LOL)  She seemed geniune and truly engrossed in her role.   urlLink Adrien Brody  did fairly well, but it is not hard to play a the type of character he played.  I mean, all roles are a challenge, but his character did not have much depth.  I will say his facial expressions were great, and sometimes I felt for his character.   urlLink Joaquin Phoenix , played Joaquin Phoenix great.  He is like a better version of  urlLink Keanu Reeves , but not by much.   I think the main problem, was that I honestly figured out "the twist" in the first five or so minutes.  The twist is that The Village takes place in the modern world, not the 19th century.  OOOOhhhhh scary and clever.  It seems a group of people who all had terrible things happen in their life decide they have had enough and decide to start a colony like the good ole' days.  One of the people's father was apparently a "Bill Gates" type guy, so when he was killed there was alot of money in his will.  Therefore, that is where they got the money for their new utopia.  The Village is surrounded by a hidden fence on the other side of the forbidden woods.  On the modern side of the fence, is a private road that encompasses ten square miles.  There is a patrol service, so no one jumps the fence.  Also, and this is the "yeah right" part, apparently they paid off government officials to make the area a no-fly zone.   Okay.   Anyway, the elders of the village decide that they must keep their children from journeying into the woods.  Thus, the creatures.  Which are just well made costumes.  They planted recording devices in the woods to make the sounds of the creatures.  Who changes the batteries?  When do they do it?  How are they not seen, considering that there is a watch tower at the edge of the woods?  They don't answer these questions.  The kids are scared to go through the woods, so they don't.  Except for Joaquin's character, he wants to go.  He also is in love with Bryce's character who is blind.  Her blindness is important, later.  Too make a long story short, too late.  Adrien's character who is retarded, maybe from inbreeding, loves her too.  He stabs Joaquin's character badly.  That scene was well directed and acted!  Joaquin's character is about to die, unless someone braves the woods and goes to the towns.  Hence, the trouble.  If anyone goes, they will learn the truth.  Well, almost anyone.  Bryce's character wants to go to save her love and they decide to let her go.  Her father tells her the part of the truth.  She, and two other boys head in to the woods.  The two other boys get scared and head back to the village.  She goes on.  She makes it over the fence after killing one of the creatures, which makes her believe in the legend again.  The creature is actually Adrien's character in the costume, and after he is dead, his dead body being brought back from the woods proves the beasts exist too.  Oh, and since Bryce's character is blind she knows nothing of the real world.  It ends happy.  Okay, the story is somewhat original.  That is the best part in the movie.  However, its execution is terrible.  The movement is slow and ill-paced.  All the characters speak in an old fashioned way.  You mean, all the elders were able to change how they were raised to speak that easily?  C'mon.  I have lived in Vegas for almost two years and I still say Y'all... no one else here does.  No one uses contractions, one of the elders would have to slip up.  The buildings and tombstones look to new or well-made.  Everything in the movie seems just off.  Maybe, just maybe, that was his point.  Who knows?  There are too many things that are forced in order to move the plot or even justify the story.  It is not a horrible movie, just slow and contrived.  If you want, check it out.  Eventhough, I told you the story I am sure you could figure it out quickly anyway.  "Sixth Sense" was good, "The Village" not so much.

        Well, Kid Lysol's Silent Parade has inspired me to be a copy cat. However, maybe I can put my on spin on it.   Movie Quote:   urlLink "Office Space"  Bob 1: "Looks like you been missing alot of work lately." Peter: "I would'nt say I've been missing it Bob."  urlLink Listen Here    Song Lyrics:   urlLink Ben Folds'  "Give Judy My Notice" "I knew, if I made it easy for you." "You'd settle for me, yeah, eventually."  My Words: Here is a poem I wrote entitled "Dependence".    Disclaimer: All poems featured on this website are copyrighted by the Library of Congress under my name. We now bring you your regularly scheduled poem.         Waiting,     That's the worst part.       Or is it the fulfillment?  Hoping, It consumes all you are Nothing else is allowed.  Praying, Knowing that it is futile. But it is your only recourse.  Counting, The cliche minutes in frustration. Causing the time to barely pass.  Loving, Is it the reason for your pangs? Or is it merely dependence?  Depending, An action of selfishness? Or is it something more profound than love?  Ringing, The sound that awakens your heart. Or does it simly feed your destructive habit?      What does everyone think? Holler back!

      Hello,  Well, I just got a Game Boy Advance SP.  I know, I know, I am too old for such childish toys.  However, I implore you to think about the joy you had in your childhood and to realize that sometimes you just need to revert.  I really feel it is a good, harmless, and reasonable stress-reliever.  I guess I should go work out or explore nature or something, but it is always over one hundred and five in Vegas.  I think that is 'nuff said.  Here is the point of this post.  Game Boy Advance SP, good system, yet old graphics and game styles.  That is just what I needed.  I *gulp* own a Sony Playstation 2 and a Nintendo Game Cube, and I never play them.  I just don't like all these new crazy games.  They are beautiful, they are extensive, they are intense, they are hard as hades.  Granted, some are really fun and all that.  However, I just don't have the patience or time anymore.  I would rather plop in Super Mario Advance 4 and relive the days of Super Mario Bros. 3.  That is one fun and addictive game.  That is Side-Scrolling done well.  I also am enjoying the Metroid games as well.  Sometimes you  have to take a step back to take a step forward.  This little blast-from-the-past device is a wonderful little distraction from the hustle and bustle of daily life.  Even my wife likes to play it from time to time, maybe that is why she gave it to me.  Her drug of choice is even further back...Pac-Man!  Dear Readers, I tell you what...go out and buy a Game Boy.  There is a lot of games out there, a good amount of the Atari games, numerous original Nintendo, and a bunch of new stuff.  I guarantee each person will find something that they can veg out to.  Plus, there are great times that the Game Boy come is handy.  Here is a small list.  Waiting at the Doctor's office, taking a long flight, getting stuck in traffic to the point where you can take your eyes of the road, when you can't sleep and you have no books.  Those are just a few.  Until next time, take care or yourself and each other.  Sorry, Jerry Springer moment.

       I decided to make this a weekly installment. Basically, like Kid_Lysol's urlLink  "The Deafening Silence",  I will have "Closer To Home". I will list a song that makes me feel something...Some sort of emotion. It could be sad, thought-provoking, happy, honestly who knows. Plus, I may include one of my poems (like tonight) and other things. Tonight, dear readers, I am going to list song lyrics to a very underrated and forgotten band,  urlLink "Sister Hazel".  This is a song off their 2003 album  urlLink "Chasing Daylight",  which I would be willing to bet (and I live in Las Vegas) no one has heard.      Best I'll Ever Be      Words by: Ken Block          I miss you   I miss being overwhelmed by you   And I need rescue, I think I'm fading away   But I keep thinking that you'll wake me up with a whisper in my ear   I keep hoping that you'll sneak in my room      So I wait and I wait   And I run old scenes through my tired head   Of the days we laid by the school and said forever   Was that the best I'll ever be      I miss you   I miss talking all night long with you   And I need this to find a way to your home   My love can you hear me   Have I been hoping loud enough, wishing hard enough   Can you see me when I'm asleep all alone - alone      So I wait and I wait   And I run myself in the same old circles   I sit and I stare   And I run old scenes through my tired head   Of the days that we laid by the school and said forever   Was that the best I'll ever be      Can't keep my hands from shaking   Stumbling through the wreckage again   But you're gone      So I wait and I wait   And I run myself in the same old circles   And I sit and I stare   And I run old scenes through my tired head   Of the days that we laid on our backs and said forever   Was that the best I'll ever be   Was that the best I'll ever be   Was that the best I'll ever be    What do you think? Everytime I hear that song, I get lost in the past. It brings me back to a place in time that, honestly, I wish I could forget. No, not forget, just change. If you have known me for a long time, then I think you know what time in my life I am talking about. Well, perhaps   who   I am talking about. My favorite line is "I miss being overwhelmed by you", I think that is one of the most incredible feelings in life. That feeling of being so moved by someone that they seem overwhelming. It scares you how much that person means to you and how powerful those feeling are.  I have those feelings for my wife now.  She is incredible and I am blessed to have her.  I truly love her. Let's move on to a poem...Shall we? We shall.       Yesterday's Friend     Written By: Ryon Collins (Copyright on file with  urlLink Library of Congress )         I never know whom to hurt   I always know how to though   The pain they feel is my own.   It is the only release I know.      Did the future already pass?   Is tomorrow gone away?   Yesterday is my only enemy,   Although I am His friend, they say.      Could you love the one you hate,   If the hate became too mundane?   If the passion became too alive?   Try not to, and be consumed by pain.      This should never be read.   This should forever be known.   My life is theirs to consume,   Yet my sorrow is all that is shown.      Be still in the pale strained light,   For Yesterday's friend is always near.   He remains in the darkness,   He remains in sight, though not clear.      Just listen to His cry and feel His love. He needs the present, like nothing else.   The path He chooses is neither worn nor new,   It has always been there, waiting, but what for?      Again, what do you think? Does either of the above works move you? Do they bring you back? Do you think, "What the hell?" Let me know. Until next time...      Quote of the post...   "If you cry yourself to sleep, does it rain inside your dreams?" From "Ava" by  urlLink Retrospect .
