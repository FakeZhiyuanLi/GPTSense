           Okay so today I slept in until 11:30 and then studied for my SAT's and then cleaned my room and the stupid stuff I am supposed to do first before I can get online.  My dad is out of town, Libby's "party" is tomorrow and I am really excited.  I found out that hoops wasn't invited to the "party" but hoops thinks that they would just be bored.  Besides it was only just supposed to be a get together but we had to say it was a "party" for me to go.  Well over and out!             Love Lily

            Okay, Monday, first day of vaction but when I woke up this afternoon it was a different way to spend my vaca.  My mother first had me study for my SAT's and then my mom made a list of chores for me and my sister to do.  My sister is always in a bitchy mood and it irratates the crap out of me.  I can't wait until I go to Libby's house on Wednesday.  I get to get out of this house!  AND PARTY!!!  I mean act nicely and watch educational movies and tv shows.  H-E-L-L N-O!  My mother thinks that I am going to do something soooo bad if I am with Libby or Aqua.  I trust both of them and if they are doing something bad, then I will have the guts to them they are.  But I don't think that I am that stupid to do something like....have sex, drink, do drugs.   If I want to just get high then all I have to do is eat skittles and drink a A&W root beer.  Oh well my sister is getting more bitchy as my dad bugs her about getting a job.  Looking at colleges for me parents are excited and sister gets jealous.  At this point I can't deciced how my summer is going to be.

       So today I wake up at 12:30 in the afternoon, I like sleeping in so deal with it.  So anyways the past month I have been quite busy...went to oregon, go to parties, and gettting everything ready for my party, PLUS me and my friend Aqua are planning a Harry Potter party, to celebrate his 16th birthday.  That is going to be really fun.  I found out just yesterday that the 6th Harry Potter book is going to be Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  Wow! Some of my HP fan/friends have been wondering who the half blood prince is?  I would like it to be James Potter, which means that harry is too.  Oh well my friend wants it to be Sirius Black...aka padfoot.  But I think any of the marauders should be the prince, EXCEPT WORMTAIL! Damn to the depths with him! Well got to go find some more gossip....
