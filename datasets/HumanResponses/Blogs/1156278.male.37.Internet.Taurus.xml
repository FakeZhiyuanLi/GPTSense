       Clear and present danger?  I watched the RTL4 and NOS news this morning (for those not familiar with these channels: they are Dutch TV-channels) to get a glimpse of the State of The Union, as presented by Pres. Bush last night.  Well, what can I say, it couldn't be more clear: the US is gonna atack Iraq no matter what. They don't need proof or a smoking gun either:  "Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent," Bush said. "Since when have terrorists and tyrants announced their intentions, politely putting us on notice before they strike?"  What this means (in my humble opinion) is, that if you just label a country as a terrorist state, you can just do whatever you like.  I just think Bush wants a war to distract the US citizens from all the internal (economic) problems...  Another interesting titbit is of course the the formation of a "Terrorist Threat Integration Center" to collect and analyze foreign and domestic intelligence information. The FBI and CIA were widely criticized for not cooperating and communicating before the September 11, 2001 attacks.   The office supposedly will be based at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, with CIA Director George Tenet in charge, administration officials said.   Again, to me this clearly points to the start of a government within a government. The kind of shady powerfull organizations you usally see in movies like  urlLink Enemy of the State (1998)  or  urlLink Conspiracy Theory .  Now, I am not a US citizen but I do feel connected with the US, not in the last place because I have some family there and a close grilfriend.  All in all I do worry a lot about the results and repercussions that will follow the start of the war.  "It is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong" --Voltaire (1694-1778)

        Blogger sucks!  Nice free service I thought. Well publishing something to my page seems hardly possible: although Blogger states "upload succesfull", it turns out that checking the FTP log actually states it DID NOT work.. Grrrr...

       Where is the smoking gun?  Call me suspicious, but why can't the UN produce a smoking gun when it comes to the evil empire Iraq? Maybe Iraq isn't half the threat the US wants the world to believe.  On the other hand: if they (they as in 'the US') really want a war, you would think they can 'invent' the proof they need. Afterall: they were able to blame Lee Harvey Oswald for the murder of John F. Kennedy back in the 60's.  So how hard can it be to forge some documents and convert them into the smoking gun they need? Or  plant some evidence in some strategic places.  Last week they almost got there when they found some obsolete, forgotten warheads. The US claimed it to be warheads for missiles, but anyone could see by just looking at them that these 'warheads' would only be good for the scrapheap.  I am very curious what Bush will tell the world today when he addresses the congress and the American public.  I, as a European, am very intrerested to find out how he will deal with it.

       USA to act alone?  Just read this article on CNN ( urlLink Powell: U.S. prepared to act alone ).  Is it me or is this whole deal just getting more and more out of control?   A collegue of me send me a cartoon about the whole Iraq situation that is rather funny. I will try and add it here (through the magic wonders of FTP).  Anyhow: my 2 cents worth: they should have finished the job years ago when Schwarzkopf had the chance. In my opinions (but who's intrested anyway) this is a darn farce anyway.

        Monday Alert: another week coming up!!   Mondays really fuck up my life (pardon my French). I get up in the morning, slowly forcing my body to actually move to the bathroom. Looking back at me on the other side of the mirror, I see some freak with small eyes, exploded hair, yawning like I'm trying to get a new world record. O yeah, it’s Monday alright.   Monday tells you 2 things:   A. Your weekend is over B. Work, Work WORK!  A typical Monday for me looks a bit like this:  7:45am - Starting up movement-coordination brain cells 8:05am - Starting shaving feature (trying not to bleed myself to death) 8:15am - Dressing up (damn, my shirt is wrinkled again) 8:20am - Feed my cats auto-drive system kicks in 8:30am - Make sandwiches for work 8:45am - Starting driving ability system to commute between Almere - Amsterdam 9:20am - Boot up my Apple Powerbook G4 Titanium (first smile of the day) 9:30am - powering up coffee-mechanism control center 9:35am - Life support enabled (after 2 coffee, milk, 3 sugar) 10:00am - Main act-react system online 10:30am - Speech enabled (more or less) 11:00am - Finally I wake up mentally, I find myself sitting at my desk. I’m at work, Arrrggh...  And I just know millions of people go through this same routine like me!  I'm *NOT* a morning person. I can stay up late (4am) and sleep all day. When I'm behind a PC (like now, writing this) I can sit there for hours forgetting the world around me. A social life? Where can I download that? Let's face it, I am a sorry ass GEEK! And I need a vacation.   On the positive side: I do like my job. It's demanding since we have a rather small team, but it's challenging because of that.

       "A true Gadgeteer"   All right folks, I have a confession to make: I’m a slave of modern technology. If something cool and new comes out, I just have to have it. Ok, I do not own a state of the art plasma TV or stuff like that (I am not a millionaire), but I do own 2 Pc’s, 3 PDA’s, 3 phones, my car is equipped with GPS, I have internet via cable (and my own network), I work with Windows, Linux and OS X, etc. etc….  So when I finally saw the brand new  urlLink Sony Ericsson P800 mobile phone this weekend, I had to have it. In the US you can’t get it yet, but you can  urlLink pre-order the P800 here.  This is the ultimate gadget: it’s a phone and PDA in one and it is not half as bulky as, lets say,  urlLink the XDA from O2  or has the problem its doesn’t work in Europe (like the Tungsten from Palm).  Among the cool things:  - pops-up a photo of the person calling - give every caller its own ringtone - can play midi, wav and MP3 (as ringtones) - polyphonic - has full PDA capabilities - built-in camera (max 640x480) - Handsfree from the handset (flip it open and it turns on the mic)  And so on…  So now I start taking little pictures of all the people in my phonebook: that’s one of the coolest things so far… For instance: when my office calls me, I see a picture of the building and I hear Beavis scream: “I am Cornholio, I need teepee for my bunghole”.  I think the expression is: a fool with a tool is still a fool…

       The number of the beast  In all the commotion around the upcoming war in the Middle East, people regain new interest in all the biblical and other mystical prophecies that surrounds these global events of epic proportions.    Although I consider myself not religious in a biblical sense, I do find these prophecies - or better said: the interpretations of the prophecies – very interesting (one look at my DVD collection will reveal some movies with a very religious theme).  So I dug up some interesting things on the net. Let’s start with the bible, King James Edition in English, and look up Revelations:   "16:13: And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14: For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 16: And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon."   Now, off course we can interpret this in various ways, but some say Armageddon is placed in the Middle East and the three spirits are the armies of the US, England and Iraq. So they are there to spread the war all over our world.  Fascinating stuff.  One of the countless websites that says its on too the explanation of these things is this one:  urlLink Count the Number of the Beast: Who is the Antichrist, The Beast of Revelation 13? . The author is also a guy who developed “(…)a new holistic method of prophecy(…)  to do his own prophecies.  Off course (and this is pretty obvious) he has a page stating Osama Bin Laden is the antichrist:  urlLink Count the Number of the Beast: Who is the Antichrist, The Beast of Revelation 13? Osama the "Destroyer" . How lame can you get? I also think that the picture of the painting has been tampered with (I will try and verify this, since it’s a Dutch painting).   TCPA, TPM, DRM and the number of the beast?  Again a quote to start with:    “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads (Rev 13:16): And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name (Rev 13:17). Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six (Rev 13:18).”    “Ok,” you ask yourself, “how the hell – pardon my French – did this guy mix computers and religion together?”. Well, hang on this is an interesting theory that actually binds Microsoft, the US government and computers together.  When I hypostasize (hmm, I had to look up that word in a dictionary) about the number of the beast, I must say  I rather believe the Mark or number of the Beast will be a (financial) identification system that the Antichrist will establish during the tribulation then a person. He will use the Mark as a tool for controlling all aspects of society.   Well as I see it, TCPA, TPM, DRM might be part of that.  First let me explain the terms TCPA, TPM, DRM;  TCPA = Trusted Computing Platform Alliance TPM = Trusted Platform Module DRM = Digital Rights Management  In short this is how it works;  TCPA will make copying software (or digital assets in general) impossible whether or not the copying itself is legal or illegal. In Holland for instance, the law says that anyone is entitled to make a copy or backup for personal use of any medium (CD, video, DVD whatever), as long as I am the owner.  TCPA will block anything the owner of the original (i.e. Microsnot software or music) doesn’t want you to do. TCPA will also prevent (the same) software from running on more than one computer.  The core of it is a chip called Trusted Platform Module or TPM. TPM is just a super-CPU-ID that will also contain - next to a unique identification number – a cryptographic key and some checksums. Its like a mega-dongle (a dongle being a hardware key. It's a secure, copy-protected device supplied with software that plugs into a computer port).  Just like with a steel ball on a demolition crane the TPM in itself is harmless: it’s the chain connected to it that makes it dangerous. The chain in this case is called Palladium and is propagated by … Microsnot!  By matching serial numbers of software with the PC it runs on, the same serial will never work on another PC. Music, movies and other files will be chained to your PC by use of the TPM chip. Copying or trading these files to another PC will be impossible; copying to systems without TMP won’t work either.   Did I say PC? Well TPM is not just good for PC’s. Mobile phones, PDA’s and anything else more or less electronically can have a TPM chip.    Which brings me to the part that says: “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name”  And that number is not 666, it’s the unique identification number TPM will give you! And it will make it impossible for you to buy or sell something unless you have a TPM!    Other views please?  Some folks believed the Beast number was to be a certain year. Because of this, the year 666 AD was looked on as the date for the advent of the Antichrist. When that date came and went, the year 1666 was then looked on with dread. Nostradamus pointed to the year 1999 as an inverted 666 year.  Because the Beast number will have something to do with the Antichrist's name, people all over the world have been busy working equations to figure out if every world leader of their day has a name that can be made to equal 666 in some way. Guess what: depending on how you figure it, 666 can be made to add up to just about anyone's name.  I even have heard about a number of superstitions or phobias about this number (all from the Internet). One person refused to ride in a car because the license plate had 666 on it. Supposedly whenever some people go shopping, and the cash register reads triple six in anyway, they add something like a stick of gum to go past the unholy number.  When President and Mrs. Reagan moved out to California their house number was, you guessed it, Six Six Six. They had it changed to 668. When a governing body, like the UN or Congress, produces a bill numbered 666, it receives a good going over by prophecy watchers to see if it has a connection with end time events.  Now on the other hand, the next time you receive your water bill and upon opening it, you discover it comes to Euro or $ 6.66 or you realize you've used 666 cubic feet or cubic meters of water - don't go pulling your hair out. Unless it has a direct connection to the Antichrist or is some special message from God, 666 is just another number that randomly comes up.   What can I say: I just love conspiracy theories!   Next time I have time for it I will focus on the Pale Rider.   (…)and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth(…)   Ps: if these ramblings don’t make any sense: don’t worry, I wrote them while doing lots of other things during this day, like cooking, cleaning, eating, ironing and watching some movies.

       Give peace a chance - Point of no return  At the same time I’m writing this, probably a thousand other people are also filling their Blogs with the same words: Give peace a chance. Although I did not attend any of the so many peace protests that went on yesterday (see:  urlLink CNN.com - Cities jammed in worldwide protest of war in Iraq - Feb. 15, 2003  and  urlLink CNN.com - European protesters fill cities - Feb. 15, 2003 ), I do support the effort to keep peace.  Even my girlfriend in the US did attend the peace rally that went on in here city ( urlLink Tallahassee Democrat | 02/16/2003 | Hundreds rally against war ) and I bet she never ever did something like that before.  One of the reasons I did not attend the peace rally that took place here in Amsterdam, is the fact that I do not believe they make a difference: only voting does. What I mean is that they should have some referenda about these subjects. Just let people vote directly.   I mean: let’s stay realistic here: Bush already invested a couple of billion to get soldiers and equipment over there in the desert; he has reached the point of no return already: backing out now will mean he will loose face and I think that nothing else frightens Bush more than that.  And while we are on this subject: it is so blatantly obvious that Bush is measuring with two measures. Go figure: how else can it be that he is going to attack Iraq but not taking action against North Korea? According to the CIA they already have nuclear capabilities ( urlLink CNN.com - Tenet: North Korea has ballistic missile capable of hitting U.S. - Feb. 12, 2003 ). Iraq on the other hand has not: at least not proven yet. They don’t have even have a nuclear plant (like North Korea does). They might (emphasis on might) have some materials to maybe construct one. But they certainly do not have it yet.  What’s the difference one might ask? Well I can only think up one word: oil.

       Unraveling Donnie's mystery  Before I start raving about the peace protests that went on yesterday all over the world, I will just start with a lighter subject;  Yesterday I  bought the Donnie Darko DVD. Yes, it’s true. I shelled out some 20 Euros (at this moment it’s the equivalent of about 23 dollars, since the Euro went up) and bought me the “DTS Special Edition” supposedly “loaded with extras”.  Ever since I discussed the movie on Feb. 3rd, I couldn’t help being (and staying) very mesmerized by it. There was another coincidence that I didn’t mention here yet. When I gave the movie to my colleague to watch it, the next day when he gave it back to me, he showed me something really funny;  As it turned out he had a newspaper clipping with him from that very same day, discussing the DTS Special Edition of Donnie Darko. Weird huh? Remember this movie came out in 2001. The odds of a newspaper writing about it in 2003 are very small!  Anyway, it was a very positive critique about the movie but very negative about the extras on the DVD. In fact it said it spoiled the mystery of the movie. I didn’t have time yet to watch all of it with the director’s commentary on, but I did watch the deleted scenes already. One of them is rather unveiling; it’s a short sequence that shows that the medication Donnie is taking is actually a placebo.  As soon as I get time I will get back on this issue, but it’s fascinating already to watch these deleted scenes (with the director’s commentary).

       Getting there  It feels like the war can break out this week. Bush's war retoric isn't going to end soon and we just know he wants to start a war. Whats up with that and whats up with Korea? Are the US afraid to tackle the problems they have with Iraq by diplomacy? They are not doing anything war-like against Korea.   Movie freak  I watched Donnie Darko again the day before yesterday. Then I gave the film to a collegue of mine to watch it: he liked it too. I will buy this movie soon. Its about $20 but worth every penny. I am a DVD addict now. Ever since I got my widescreen TV and my DVD home theatre I can't control myself and I just keep buying movies like crazy. Have a look at my collection here:  urlLink DVD Profiler's My Profiler Collection . Is that slowy getting out of control or what?

       "In measuring a circle one begins anywhere"  Ok, its 23:45 on a Monday night and I just saw a movie that left me puzzled way beyond usually. I pride myself in being rather a movie buff and I own a fast growing library of DVD's including the Sixth Sense.  Now, I have seen some Sixth Sense rip-offs like "The Others" but none of them came close to leaving me behind with a very very disturbed feeling like this one did: "Donnie Darko". There, I finally said it.  I never ever heard about it, never ever saw a preview or anything else. When i rented the movie I did it because finally it went from the A list (which costs like 4 Euro's to rent for just 1 day!) to the B list where you can keep the movie a week.  Already I know I will have to see it more than 1 time this week because it is so damn intriguing.  For those that have no clue whatsoever I'm talking about, go check it out. If you only read the plot synopsis you just know how strange it’s going to be!  "Donnie Darko needs to take his meds (he seems to be a schizophrenic). He starts seeing a tall, mutant rabbit named Frank, who leads Donnie to do bad things at night because, well, the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Frank also saves Donnie from a jet engine that falls from the sky and crashes into his bedroom, not to mention turning him on to time travel."  If you seen movies like Memento or Fight Club or anything that compares to those you will need to see this one.  The famous (or should I say infamous) Rotten Tomatoes has some really funny comments on this movie from some magazines:  "reels the viewer in like a black hole, like a quicksand hourglass." "Think Rushmore meets Twelve Monkeys and you're on the right lines." "... has 'cult classic' stamped all over it." "It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen before, and it sets a great tone that takes you places you've never been before." "Puts the comparable American Beauty to shame." "A stunning blend of sci-fi, psychological thriller, and dark comedy." "There was no easy logline for Donnie Darko. That’s probably why it was doomed to become one of 2001’s best movies no one heard of."  When a movie is this controversial it usually means its either a great piece of art or something you will see sold for under $10 (or Euro's) real soon.  And what do I think? Let me sleep on this one. I just know I will be back on this one soon!

       Bizarre coincidence?  Sometimes life is so weird. I was reinstalling a PC of a friend and I put XP on it. Now you might know that XP has this login screen with little icons on it. You can change them and replace them with a photo of yourself if you want. It seems that XP chooses a random icon to represent the people that can login. I created 2 users so I had 2 icons.  Now here comes the bizarre coincidence: XP choose an icon of.... the space shuttle! I could *not* believe my eyes but it is true. Go through the icons and you will see there is one that is the space shuttle at take off.  Life IS more bizarre than any story!

       The Final Frontier  Wow. Thats the only word I can think up for now. This afternoon I received an e-mail alert by CNN stating that NASA had lost contact with the space shuttle while they were on their re-entry to earth. Needless to say this is again a big tragedy. I still remember when the Challenger blew up years ago. Now the Columbia is gone and with it a fine crew of 7.  Off course this will set back all the missions planned for this and coming years. I'm sure they don't allow any shuttle to lift-off untill they have a clear idea what caused this. Since they broke up or exploded on re-entry my first - non expert - idea would be that the heat shield got damaged and as a result the shuttle exploded. But who knows? One thing is for sure: there won't be any round-trips to the ISS soon (unless they need to get the people of it or transport some food and other things.  Given the curcumstances (a war is at hand)  I wonder what will happen now: will Bush just go on or will this tragedy slow down his plans?

       When looking back one is always right   Nothing is easier than looking back on things and analyzing them. Such is also the case with the war in Iraq. People that were against the war (like me) are afraid that many innocent people will get hurt. But now it seems it’s a walk-over for the US. I wonder how much longer the war will last.

       “There is nothing more frightening than ignorance in action – J. Von Goethe (1749-1832)”  With the war going into another day, this is a truly interesting quote that popped into my mind. The Iraqi’s seem to be able to hold back the US and British army more than we expected and this will make it more and more difficult to tell when this war will be over.   Just a dream?   In the night the war started I woke up in the morning from a dream I had. Well, actually it was more of a fragment of a dream. The fact that I woke up from it and remembered it actually, was in itself very unique. Usually I don’t remember anything I dream. So this was pretty special and the subject was also very frightening.   My dream consisted of a vision – or image – that popped into my mind together with one thought.   The setting was very apocalyptic: the image was that of a giant mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb and then the blast impact rushing towards me. Then came what I can only describe as my final thought: “Oh my god the stupid idiots finally did it”.   Then I woke up. When I turned on my TV I discovered that the war had started and together with the image from my dream this gave me a very uneasy feeling that day.   Off course this dream and thought might come from the many movies I’ve seen. In particularly a scene in Terminator 2 pops into my mind. But all in all it was rather a weird experience.

        11 hours, 11 minutes to go  According to my countdown clock we are now 11hrs, 11 minutes away from another Gulf war. At least, that is what we think: given the circumstances the US and Brittain (I keep forgetting them all the time) might attack earlier. This morning I spoke to a friend of mine who is an officer in the Dutch army. He said that it is no accident the US did choose this date to attack. According to him it is an advantage that it is full moon right now. Even though the US troops are technologically very advanced, they can use the extra light from the moon when attacking. Night vision doesn't work in complete darkness, contrary to popular belief. In fact they work the best with a full moon. So do all the electronics in the fighter and bomber jets. Off course these kind of considerations go way beyond normal people like me. It sounds as a pretty clinical approach. But in times of war that is the only option.

        "I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong." -- Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)  With a new Gulf war on its way in the next 24 hours, I can only think up this quote from this famous British philosopher who also was a know pascifist. Who are we to decide for another person - let alone another country - what is right and what is wrong? Now, we all know Saddan Hoessein is an evil dictator who exploits his own people. However, starting a war is not the solution to the problem, since it will hurt innocent people that have part in anything going on.  That the war was coming was obvious: and I quote myself from my February 16th blog:  "(...)I mean: let’s stay realistic here: Bush already invested a couple of billion to get soldiers and equipment over there in the desert; he has reached the point of no return already: backing out now will mean he will loose face and I think that nothing else frightens Bush more than that.(...)"  This is the reason he never even put up a vote in the UN and why is going to ignore the UN.   Now, another big issue in my mind is: who will have the power to stand up against the US next time? It seems the US is the only super-power left in the world that can ignore the rest of the world (UN) and do whatever it wants...   In retrospect this is all because of what happened during the first Gulf war. The Following is an excerpt from the Encarta Encyclopedia:   The Gulf War, August 1990 - February 1991    The Iraqi-Kuwaiti border had been the focus of tension in the past. Kuwait was nominally part of the Ottoman Empire from the 18th century until 1899 when it asked for, and received, British protection in return for autonomy in local affairs. In 1961 Britain granted Kuwait independence, and Iraq revived an old claim that Kuwait had been governed as part of an Ottoman province in southern Iraq and was therefore rightfully Iraq’s. Iraq’s claim had little historical basis, however, and after intense global pressure Iraq recognized Kuwait in 1963. Nonetheless, there were occasional clashes along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, and relations between the two countries were sometimes tense.   Relations between the two countries improved during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), when Kuwait assisted Iraq with loans and diplomatic backing. After the war ended in 1988, the Iraqi government launched a costly program of reconstruction. By 1990 Iraq had fallen $80 billion in debt and demanded that Kuwait forgive its share of the debt and help with other payments.  At the same time, Iraq claimed that Kuwait was pumping oil from a field that straddled the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border and was not sharing the revenue. Iraq also accused Kuwait of producing more oil than allowed under quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), thereby depressing the price of oil, Iraq’s main export .   Iraq’s complaints against Kuwait grew increasingly harsh, but they were mostly about money and did not suggest that Iraq was about to revive its land claim to Kuwait. When Iraqi forces began to mobilize near the Kuwaiti border in the summer of 1990, several Arab states tried to mediate the dispute. Kuwait, seeking to avoid looking like a puppet of outside powers, did not call on the United States or other non-Arab powers for support. For their part, the U.S. and other Western governments generally expected that at worst Iraq would seize some border area to intimidate Kuwait, so they avoided being pulled into the dispute. Arab mediators convinced Iraq and Kuwait to negotiate their differences in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, on August 1, 1990, but that session resulted only in charges and countercharges. A second session was scheduled to take place in Baghd&#257;d, the Iraqi capital, but Iraq invaded Kuwait the next day, leading some observers to suspect that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had planned the invasion all along.   The United Nations Security Council and the Arab League immediately condemned the Iraqi invasion. Four days later, the Security Council imposed an economic embargo on Iraq that prohibited nearly all trade with Iraq. Iraq responded to the sanctions by annexing Kuwait on August 8, prompting the exiled Sabah family to call for a stronger international response. In October, Kuwait’s rulers met with their democratic opponents in Jiddah, with the hope of uniting during the occupation. Fewer than half of all Kuwaitis stayed in Kuwait through the occupation; of those who stayed, some formed resistance organizations but with little effect.   Any armed attempt to roll back the Iraqi invasion depended on Saudi Arabia, which shares a border with both Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia had neither the power nor the inclination to fight Iraq alone; if the Saudi government invited foreign troops into the country to attack Iraq, however, it risked appearing to be under their influence. Saudi rulers did eventually open the country to foreign forces, in large part because they were alarmed by Iraq’s aggressive diplomacy and because U.S. intelligence reports claimed that Iraqi forces were well positioned for a strike against Saudi Arabia. Other Arab countries, such as Egypt, Syria, and the smaller states along the Persian Gulf, feared that even if Iraq’s conquests stopped at Kuwait, Iraq could still intimidate the rest of the region. Western powers supported a rollback of Iraqi forces because they were afraid Iraq could now dominate international oil supplies. Finally, other members of the United Nations (UN) did not want to allow one UN member state to eliminate another.   Beginning a week after the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait and continuing for several months, a large international force gathered in Saudi Arabia. The United States sent more than 400,000 troops, and more than 200,000 additional troops came from Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, France, Kuwait, Egypt, Syria, Senegal, Niger, Morocco, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. Still other countries made other contributions: Turkey allowed air bases on its territory to be used by coalition planes, and Japan and Germany gave financial support. The initial goal of the force was to prevent further Iraqi action, but most countries were aware the force might ultimately be used to drive Iraq from Kuwait.   The Iraqis tried to deter and split the growing international coalition through several means. They made it clear that their adversaries would pay heavily if war broke out, and they hinted they would use chemical weapons and missile attacks on cities, as they had against Iran during the Iran-Iraq War. Iraq also detained citizens of coalition countries who had been in Kuwait at the time of the invasion and said they would be held in militarily sensitive areas—in effect using them as human shields to deter coalition attacks. Iraq eventually released the last of the foreigners in December 1990 under pressure from several Arab nations.    In an effort to weaken Arab support within the coalition, Iraq tried to link its occupation of Kuwait to the larger Arab-Israeli conflict in the region. The Iraqis argued that since the UN had not forced Israel to leave Arab territories it occupied during and after the Six-Day War of 1967, it should not force Iraq to leave Kuwait. The Iraqis further implied they might leave Kuwait if Israel withdrew from the Occupied Territories. Several Arab countries responded positively to Iraq’s statements; however, most of these were states such as Jordan and Yemen, which were not part of the coalition. Only in Morocco and Syria did government support for coalition involvement weaken as a result of Iraq’s initiative.    The coalition’s greatest military concern during the closing months of 1990 was that Iraqi forces would attack before coalition forces were fully in place, but no such attack took place. The coalition was also troubled that Iraq might partially withdraw from Kuwait, which could split the coalition between nations eager to avoid fighting and nations wanting to push for full withdrawal. The United States in particular feared that signs of progress might lessen the resolve of some coalition partners and so discouraged attempts to mediate the crisis. Iraq’s uncompromising stand helped build support among coalition members for the American hard line.    On November 29, with coalition forces massing in Saudi Arabia and Iraq showing no signs of retreat, the UN Security Council passed a resolution to allow member states to “use all necessary means” to force Iraq from Kuwait if Iraq remained in the country after January 15, 1991. The Iraqis rejected the ultimatum. Soon after the vote, the United States agreed to a direct meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and Iraq’s foreign minister. The two sides met on January 9. Neither offered to compromise. The United States underscored the ultimatum, and the Iraqis refused to comply with it, even threatening to attack Israel. For the United States, the meeting was its way of showing the conflict could not be resolved through negotiation.    A large minority of the U.S. population opposed military action. Opponents were concerned that the armed forces would suffer large casualties and argued that the only reason for the invasion was to guarantee a cheap supply of oil. Many such opponents thought economic sanctions would eventually force Iraq to leave Kuwait.  President George Bush maintained that larger political principles were involved and that economic sanctions would not work. He also argued that the UN resolution gave him the authority to use military force. Other Americans believed the president did not have the constitutional authority to order an attack without a congressional declaration of war. On January 12, 1991, the U.S. Congress narrowly passed a resolution authorizing the president to use force, nullifying the domestic debate.    When the UN deadline of January 15 passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, a vast majority of coalition members joined in the decision to attack Iraq. A few members, such as Morocco, elected not to take part in the military strikes. In the early morning of January 17, 1991, coalition forces began a massive air attack on Iraqi targets.   Although the coalition air forces often used very precise weapons, the attacks caused many civilian casualties and completely disrupted Iraqi civilian life. The third task, weakening Iraq’s ground forces, was larger still. The coalition used less sophisticated weaponry to strike Iraqi defensive positions in both Iraq and Kuwait, to destroy their equipment, and to undermine morale. After five and a half weeks of intense bombing and more than 100,000 flights by coalition planes, Iraq’s forces were severely damaged.   In an attempt to pry the coalition apart, Iraq fired Scud missiles at both Saudi Arabia and Israel, which especially disrupted Israeli civilian life. Iraq could thus portray its Arab adversaries as fighting on the side of Israel. The strategy failed to split the coalition, in part because the Israeli government did not retaliate. Iraq also issued thinly veiled threats that it would use chemical and biological weapons. The United States hinted in return that such an attack might provoke a massive response, possibly including the use of nuclear weapons. Iraqi ground forces also initiated a limited amount of ground fighting, occupying the Saudi border town of Khafji on January 30 before being driven back.   One month into the air war, the Iraqis began negotiating with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) over a plan to withdraw from Kuwait. Had this initiative come before the start of the coalition’s attack, it might have split the coalition; now it simply seemed a sign that the war was weighing heavily on Iraq. The war made diplomacy difficult for Iraq: officials had to travel overland to Iran and then fly to Moscow to ferry messages back and forth. Sensing victory, the coalition united behind a demand for Iraq’s unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.   LAND WAR   On February 24 the coalition launched its long-anticipated land offensive. The bulk of the attack was in southwestern Iraq, where coalition forces first moved north, then turned east toward the Iraqi port of Al Ba&#351;rah. This maneuver surrounded Kuwait, encircling the Iraqi forces there and in southern Iraq, and allowed coalition forces (mainly Arab) to move up the coast and take Kuwait city. Some Iraqi units resisted, but the coalition offensive advanced more quickly than anticipated. Thousands of Iraqi troops surrendered. Others deserted. Iraq then focused its efforts on withdrawing its elite units and sabotaging Kuwaiti infrastructure and industry. Many oil wells were set on fire, creating huge oil lakes, thick black smoke, and other environmental damage. Two days after the ground war began, Iraq announced it was leaving Kuwait.   On February 28, with the collapse of Iraqi resistance and the recapture of Kuwait—thereby fulfilling the coalition’s stated goals—the coalition declared a cease-fire. The land war had lasted precisely 100 hours. The cease-fire came shortly before coalition forces would have surrounded Iraqi forces. On March 2 the UN Security Council issued a resolution laying down the conditions for the cease-fire, which were accepted by Iraq in a meeting of military commanders on March 3. More extensive aims, such as overthrowing the Iraqi government or destroying Iraqi forces, did not have the support of all coalition members. Most Arab members, for example, believed the war was fought to restore one Arab country and not to destroy another. The United States also worried that extending the goal would have involved them in endless fighting.   The Iraqis achieved none of their initial goals. Rather than enhancing their economic, military, and political position, they were economically devastated, militarily defeated, and politically isolated. Yet because the government and many of the military forces remained intact, the Iraqis could claim mere survival as a victory. The surviving military forces were used a short time later to suppress two postwar rebellions: one involving Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq and one involving Kurds in the north.   Almost all of the casualties occurred on the Iraqi side. While estimates during the war had ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 Iraqis killed, Western military experts now agree that Iraq sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 casualties. The coalition losses were extremely light by comparison: 240 were killed, 148 of whom were American. The number of wounded totaled 776, of whom 458 were American.   CONSEQUENCES OF THE WAR    The end of the fighting left some key issues unresolved, including UN sanctions against Iraq, which did not end with the war. On April 2, 1991, the Security Council laid out strict demands for ending the sanctions: Iraq would have to accept liability for damages, destroy its chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles, forego any nuclear weapons programs, and accept international inspection to ensure these conditions were met. If Iraq complied with these and other resolutions, the UN would discuss removing the sanctions. Iraq resisted, claiming that its withdrawal from Kuwait was sufficient compliance.   Many Western observers believed the victory was hollow because Saddam Hussein was still in power. At first, when Hussein was greatly weakened, Western powers believed a rebellion might succeed in overthrowing him. Meanwhile, potential rebels within Iraq believed they might receive international help if they rebelled. But when the Shiite population of southern Iraq rebelled shortly after the cease-fire, they were greeted not with international help but with Iraqi military forces returning from the southern front. It quickly became clear that the rebels would receive no international help, although several governments gave them verbal support. Under the terms of the cease-fire, which established “no-fly zones” in the north and south, Iraqis could not attack the Shiites with airplanes, but could use helicopters, which they did to great effect. Spontaneous and loosely organized, the rebellion was crushed almost as quickly as it arose.   The defeat of the Shiites made the debate over helping Iraqi rebels even more urgent. Ultimately, however, most Western governments decided that if Hussein collapsed, Iraq might disintegrate, ushering in a new round of regional instability. A short while later, Kurds in the north of the country rebelled, and they too received no help. The Kurds were able to withstand Hussein longer than the Shiites, in part because they had a history of organized, armed resistance. In the end, though, the Kurds achieved only a very modest success: a UN-guaranteed haven in the extreme north of the country. No permanent solution—such as Kurdish self-rule—was negotiated.   Elsewhere the effects of the war were less severe. In Kuwait the prewar regime was restored, and in 1992 the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, honored his pledge in exile to reconvene the country’s parliament. Palestinians in Kuwait fared poorly after the war, in large part because Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and other prominent Palestinians had endorsed Hussein and his anti-Israeli rhetoric. Blamed for collaborating with the Iraqis, most of the Palestinian population (estimated at 400,000 before the war) was expelled from Kuwait or forbidden to return.   Following the war, thousands of American soldiers developed mild to debilitating health problems, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, short-term memory loss, rashes, headaches, blurred vision, and aching joints. The symptoms became known collectively as Gulf War Syndrome but their cause was unknown. Speculation about the cause centered on exposure to chemical and biological weapons; experimental drugs given to troops to protect against chemical weapons; vaccinations against illness and disease; insecticides sprayed over troop-populated areas; and smoke from burning oil wells ignited by retreating Iraqis. The U.S. Department of Defense originally stated it had no conclusive evidence that troops had been exposed to chemical or biological weapons. However, in 1996 the department acknowledged that more than 20,000 American troops may have been exposed to sarin, a toxic nerve gas (see Chemical and Biological Warfare). In 1997 the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suggested the deadly gas may have spread farther than previously thought, affecting perhaps hundreds of thousands of troops.   The UN continued to maintain most of the economic embargo on Iraq after the war, and several coalition countries enforced other sanctions, such as the no-fly zones. As hardships to the Iraqis mounted, the consensus on sanctions decayed. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Kuwait insisted on maintaining the sanctions, however, arguing that many of the hardships were the fault of the Iraqi government. For example, the sanctions allowed Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil for food and medicine if it also designated some of the revenue to pay for damages caused by the war. Until December 1996, Iraq rejected this deal as an infringement on its sovereignty. Hussein also complicated matters by mobilizing forces on the Kuwaiti border in late 1994 and by interfering with the work of UN inspectors. This interference nearly led to renewed military conflict in 1998, but a UN-brokered agreement allowing the inspectors to resume work averted the immediate crisis. Reports that Iraq was continuing to block inspections prompted the United States and Britain to launch a four-day series of air strikes on Iraqi military and industrial targets in December. In response, Iraq declared that it would no longer comply with UN inspection teams, called for an end to the sanctions, and threatened to fire on aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. Through early 1999, Iraq continued to challenge the patrols, and British and U.S. planes struck Iraqi missile launch sites and other targets.

       Queen's Day; the Dutch national garage sale day   Ok, for those not familiar with the ‘Dutch way of life’; today is Queens Day. We celebrate the birthday of our Queen (well, actually the birthday of our Queen’s mum) and this is a national holiday so everyone has a day off.  We celebrate this by means of the largest outdoor garage sale you can imagine. Everyone cleans there attic or garage and tries to sell all the rubbish they didn’t want to throw away with the garbage. But that’s what most of the stuff is: garbage. You’ll find the most stupid things on a day like this: old clothes, toys, books and old electronics. You name it, and someone is trying to sell it.  It’s really funny how you can sell junk to someone else that probably will try to sell it next year.  Anyway: I’m kicking back and relaxing by watching some movies and editing my webpage (like this blog) and just enjoying my free time in general.  So from this place I say to everyone: Happy Queen’s Day!

       It’s all in the game   One last post on the verge of another month. Lately I have been very busy with another hobby of mine: online gaming. I play this game called Soldier of Fortune II “Double Helix” rather vigorously. That’s why I haven’t been writing or posting a lot in my Blog.  Playing games is a way of escaping reality I guess. Things are not going so well at work at the moment and releasing the stress by killing some people (virtually of course) is one way of dealing with it.  The reality is that the company I’m working for at the moment is in deep financial trouble. We work a lot for advertising agencies and it doesn’t come as a surprise that they haven’t been spending a lot of money lately. In all reality we can say that the Dutch economy (as many others) is in trouble.  Because of that my company is going to restructure and in the same process they are merging with another firm. In fact it’s the 3rd time they reorganize in one calendar year. For me personally it’s the fourth time in one year after leaving Lost Boys in January 2002. On June 26th the people that will be fired will hear so. Since I have a 6 month contract (after having a year contract) they can simply not extend my contract and that is not the same as firing me; that means I will not get any unemployment benefits. A scary thought.  But back to SOF2 as it is called. Since the end of 2002 I’m playing this game rather fanatically and I also joined what is called a ‘clan’. Basically a clan is just a group of people that play online games (as opposed to the Klu Klux Klan whore are just a bunch of raving idiots). My clan is called Cool & Temper and our ‘tag’ (yes, I admit it either sounds childish or it sounds like being in a gang in downtown South Central LA) is *[C&T]*. People are supposed to put their tag in front of their name so people can see you’re a clansman.  I must say I rather enjoy it and you also meet a lot of people (mostly in the virtual world). I even bought a PC recently (a HP Vectra VL600) and converted it into a SOF2 clanserver so now we can play on our own server. All in all a pretty cool way of spending some time. Especially since I always like to tinker around with PC’s.  Well I guess we’ll meet again in June. Stay tuned!

       Freedom and justice for all  Today is Liberation day in Holland. And although it's not a national holiday anymore (God knows why?) a lot of people have the day off to celebrate the fact that the Allied countries (mostly the US) saved our butt in WWII. There are a few open-air concerts today and of course the TV is filled with the usual movies like "The Longest Day" and such.  Looking out of the window of my work (its cold, clouded and looks like rain), listening to an oldie (A Forest, The Cure) on my iTunes, makes me a bit depressed. However I am working on some documents that need to be finished soon and the fact that I'm alone in the office will ensure I'll cover some ground here today!  It's days like this that music is my inspiration and coffee my brother in arms.  Catch you on the flip side!

       I did it again. I bought myself a new toy. While my girlfriend is on the other side of the ocean buying a house, I decided I wanted a digital camcorder to record our trip to Paris were we will be as of June 9th. We had a camcorder with us when we went to New York in 2001 (just a few weeks before the September 11th attack) but that was a NTSC camcorder that Carrie got from a collegue. Well, this time I bought a camcorder myself. I bought the  urlLink Sony DCR-TRV33E , a nice 1 megapixel MiniDV camera with a 2.5" touchscreen, DV-in and out, S-VHS in/out, USB streaming, memorystick etc.etc.. All in all a nice package witch lots of options and the camera received good reviews.  I had my choice of camera's narrowed down to the Sony and the  urlLink JVC GR-DX300  which is one of those really small cigarette box camera's. The JVC got the camera of the year award from a magazine called Media Totaal and I must say I liked it a lot. It has a 3" screen and weighs less than the Sony. It also has a 1.3 megapixel camera mode instead of 1.03. But the design in general seems less ergonomical than the Sony. Besides that it has the microphone on top of the lens and not in front of it which makes me believe that the sound would be less than with the Sony. Also, filming with the screen open will consume lots of energy, so my choice would be to film using the viewfinder. And the JVC only has a B&W viewfinder but the Sony has a color viewfinder. Besides that: when holding the JVC I found that one is very likely to cover the microphone (on top of the lens).  Together with the cam I bought three tapes, another battery (the stand one will allow you to film about 30-40 minutes) a nice camera bag, a UV-filter and (shame on Sony) a firewire cable that wasn't included. Also, I tried the camera with the brand new iChat AV from Apple (cool!) which turns the cam into a webcam. And the camera works like a charm with iMovie thats included with Apple OS X.  All in all, I'm ready to enter the movies!

        Ok, the 26th passed and I’m still employed. Al lot of my colleagues got fired though. Some I know pretty well. They offered me a new job as ‘client services manager’ – whatever that may be. They said they want to extend my contract with one year, so I guess that is positive.  Most people I know that got fired were from the sales department. Another guy was from the IT department that I work with and he was a ‘programmer’ (although he wasn’t any good at his work he was still kind of a nice guy).  I didn’t mention this yet in any of my Blogs, but I bought a 15” TFT screen about 2 weeks ago. I bought it from one of the sales guys at my work (Pieter). Well, he got fired too. So now when I work behind my PC I have a constant reminder of that. The TFT screen was only 190 Euro which is ridiculously cheap. I’m very happy with it since it makes it possible for me to actually watch my screen when the sun is shining into my office in the morning. Some people that got laid-off worked for more that 25 years with the company and one guy was even fired one year before he could retire early! It’s a dog eat dog world out there.  Some other news this week was that my girlfriend (Carrie) bought a house. I have no idea if I mentioned this before but she is an American and lives in Tallahassee, Florida. That’s also were she bought the house. Apparently it’s a cinder block house (we use bricks mostly and re-in forced concrete) with three moderate bedrooms, a small kitchen, two bathrooms and a swimming pool.  Needless to say that I’m very excited for her (in fact I’m sponsoring her a bit too). I’ve been in Florida (Tallahassee) quit a few times over the last years  - ever since I met Carrie - and I really love the US and Florida. Although it can get there a bit too hot for my likings. One time I had to change a flat tire and it took me over twenty minutes or so because I had to get into the shade every 3 minutes because I got fried out there.  One of my favorite places to go (and this is a tip for those visiting Florida) is  urlLink Wakulla Springs . It’s the largest natural well in the world and it’s really beautiful. Just look at  urlLink this picture   and also  urlLink this one  . Anyway: now I haven’t lost my job I’m pretty sure I will go to the US in December and help out Carrie with her home and visit Wakulla!  Ok, that’s all for now ffffffolkssss….

       "Slaves can't be fired: they get sold"    As I mentioned in my latest blog my company is cutting jobs. This week, thursday the 26th to be exact, it's "bijltjesdag" as they say in Dutch. Roughly translated this means it is the day when people will get 'the axe' - a nice euphemism for saying they wil get a pink slip. As I explained before I can't be 'fired' in the legal sense of the word. They can just say they will not extend my current contract. In which case I will not get any unemployment benefits and will roughly have a month to find another job.   Because of this sword of Damocles hanging above each and everyone's head (in some departments every 1 out 2 people will be fired) the mood at work is all but great. I have great difficulties - like my collegues -  to motivate myself to go to work every day. Off course I have been looking around for another job ever since they announced the restructuring, but so far I had only 1 job interview and the sorry bastard never ever called me back (the guy was supposedly from a professional head hunters & recruiting firm but turned out to be all BUT professional).   Today's newspaper alone reported of more then 9100 lay-offs at the Dutch defense department (our 'army'). And another 6000 jobs will be cut at some IT-firm here in Holland. Let's face it: the Dutch economy is in bad shape and it's not going to improve soon. That's for sure! The outlook isn't that bright and since I'm 36 I better find something with a future soon! I do not feel like job-hopping till I'm ready for my retirement ("pensioen" in Dutch).   Oh well. Recently I got some money from my savings account from the last 6 years at Netcast and Lost Boys and I'm afraid that I will have to use that as a buffer untill I fiend something suitable. In between my girlfriend is trying to buy a house (which I finance a little as well), I'm trying to get set for our vacation in July (we're going to Paris) and I am contemplating of buying a digital videocamera (which off course I will or will not do if the 26th truns out bad for me).   But enough of the complaining: at least I will see my girlfriend again in a few weeks time! Tomorrow I have to bring my car to the garage for its first 20k tune-up. For now I figure I might watch some TV of play SOF2 for a few hours... Anything to escape the thought of losing my job.... Escapism at its best (or worst).   Keep you guys posted!

      Wow, I just had a few perfect days of vacation with my sweetheart. Between July 9th and the 14th we visited Paris, the city of lights. I took the car and we arrived there in a few hours (we left at 8am and got there at 2pm) driving through Belgium, taking the A1 toll road.  I really enjoyed myself and I think my girlfriend did too, although we didn’t have enough time to do everything we wanted. For instance, before we left I wanted to visit Mont St. Michel, a small peninsula on the west coast of France. But we never went there. One thing about the French: they do not like to speak English. With the exception of the few people working in the tourist industry they do not even try to speak English at all.  I know a few words French and I can even translate a few words, but when they start talking to you it is so hard to follow because they talk real fast. Luckily we managed and were able to do most things.  I had the idea to drive around Paris to get were we wanted, but once I got there I parked my car in a garage and never tried to get it out. We just took the busses and the subway to get around (besides that we mostly walked). Man, those Parisians drive like crazy. Years ago I went there with my school and we stayed for a week. I remembered from back then that no car in Paris is without dents or scratches on them (and I mean every car; even Rolls Royce’s). Well it was still the same!  They just park everywhere they please: even on zebra’s and on sidewalks. In fact we had a hard time going through with the wheelchair. Paris is very unfriendly for people with a handicap. It is a very good thing that Carrie can still walk and only needs to use the wheelchair after she walk’s a few miles. Otherwise it would have been impossible to do some things, like visiting Versailles for instance.  The roads there are filled with holes and are made out of cobblestones and that’s almost impossible to ride on with a wheelchair. As said we managed and so we had a great visit to Versailles, the Louvre, the Eiffel tower, the Sacre Coeur, Centre Pompidou and the Notre Dame and lots of other parts of town.  Most Parisians turned out to be very nice and even helpful some times. The prices for drinks however, are outrageous! A single glass of beer would range from 4,50 to 6,50 Euro (about 5 to 7 dollars). Food is about the same price as in Holland, so essentially they only screw you on the drinks.  And boy, we did need lots of drinks there: it was about 33 degrees Celsius (about 88 Fahrenheit) while we were there and I was drying out the first few days. Luckily we picked up some bottles and I kept myself drinking a few liters a day. Off course Carrie is used to these temperatures and I kept telling myself how lucky we were for having this weather. It was so hot that most fountains were turned off. Only a few were left running and that was a shame sometimes.  We left Paris on the 14th (a national holiday) and arrived in Almere around 5pm. The next day we spend some quality time and visited my family.  Finally my girlfriend had to leave on Wednesday morning, so we got up at 3:30am and left for the airport. I sure regret she couldn’t stay a few more days and miss her already.  Oh well. I guess I have to make arrangements to visit her this winter. Florida is always a nice place to be when it’s winter.

      Want to listen to streaming audio? Do you like lounge, triphop, downtempo fuzed jazz and other music? Then check out  urlLink SomaFM , it is listener supported, commercial free Internet Radio. I listen to it at work, at home and about everywhere else where I have internet.  I really love Internet radio. You can listen to it almost anywhere (if you have internet) and the cool thing is that there are so many channels out there that are "special interest" which means a lot of so-called "non-mainstream" music. One of my other favourites used to be  urlLink Massinova  but they are offline now because the guy running it did this through his work and they stopped supporting him. Massinova was even cooler because you could request songs and you could keep a list of favourites.  Anyway: enjoy the stream!

      This morning I had a close encounter with a real life bloodsucker and it nearly gave me a heartattack! Want to know what happened?  Ok, I was in my study editing some video that I shot way back in '97 when I first visited my girlfriend Carrie in Florida. I was just making some nice scene cuts and adding a few effects, when I noticed the noise coming from my guest bedroom. It seemed as if my cats were tearing up the place or - which sounded the most logically - they were fighting each other.  So I yelled a few times in the hope they would cut it out. Since they still seemed to be jumping up and down and making lost of noises, I decided to get up and walk into the room and kick them cats out so I finally could go on editing my video in peace and quiet. And then it happend.  As I strolled into the room a little fluttering animal flew towards me when I least expectated it! it was a BAT outta hell! I wasn't prepared for it and it almost scared me into a heartattack! You see, I live on the 4th floor (3th floor if you count the floors as we do in Europe) of an appartment building and its in the middle of town. I never have flies, bugs, mice or any kind of critters around here - except my two cats. How it got in is beyond me: it must have crawled in throught the window that was open just a bit.  Man, did it scare me! Not that I'm afraid of them (this one was just about 2 inches): I just wasn't prepared of finding a animal in there! My cats were going nuts about it, trying to jump it and running all around the room. So that was the sound I heard. The bat itself didn't make any noise and was just fluttering around trying to avoid the cats. As it would hang on to the ceiling (in itself an accomplisment) I tried to figure out how to get it out there. Bats are known to sometimes carry rabies and other diseases so I figured I could not just grab it.  In the meantime I got on the phone and called my sister to let her know of my close encounter. While on the phone the little bat flew in between the window and the blinds and my cats were desperately trying to attack it. Once on the window ledge it was quite helpless since the can't walk but just crawl and slide a bit. Anyway: I figured I had to get it out quickly before my cats would hurt it.  The problem was solved quickly: when the bat was hanging from the ceiling again, I went up there, opened the window and it went out just like that!  But boy did that little sucker scare the hell outta me! I had enough exitement for this sundaymorning :-)

      Mondays really fuck up my life (pardon my French). I get up in the morning,  slowly forcing my body to actually move to the bathroom. Looking back at me on  the other side of the mirror, I see some freak with small eyes, exploded hair,  yawning like I'm trying to get a new world record. O yeah, it’s Monday alright.   Monday tells you 2 things:   A. Your weekend is over B. Work, Work WORK!  A typical Monday for me looks a bit like this:  7:45am -   Starting up movement-coordination brain cells 8:05am -   Starting shaving feature (trying not to bleed myself to death) 8:15am -   Dressing up (damn, my shirt is wrinkled again) 8:20am -   Feed my cats auto-drive system kicks in 8:30am -   Make sandwiches for work 8:45am -   Starting driving ability system to commute between Almere - Amsterdam 9:20am -   Boot up my Apple Powerbook G4 Titanium (first smile of the day) 9:30am -   powering up coffee-mechanism control center 9:35am -   Life support enabled (after 2 coffee - with milk and 3 sugar) 10:00am - Main act-react system online 10:30am - Speech enabled (more or less) 11:00am - Finally I wake up mentally, I find myself sitting at my desk. I’m at work, Arrrggh...    And I just know millions of people go through this same routine like me!    I'm *NOT* a morning person. I can stay up late (4am) and sleep all day. When I'm  behind a PC I can sit there for hours forgetting the  world around me. A social life? Where can I download that? Let's face it, I am a  sorry ass GEEK!

      CNN.com reports:  urlLink Texan, 91, arrested for bank robbery - Aug. 14, 2003 . I guess you are never too old to be a fool.  Apparantly it wasn't the first time he did a robbery:  Rountree left a prison in Florida, where he was the oldest prisoner in the state, about a year ago after serving a three-year sentence imposed on him for a 1999 bank robbery in Pensacola.   He was caught holding up a bank in Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1998 when he was 87, and given three years' probation.   Police said he always used the same tactic -- walking unarmed into a bank with a note saying "robbery", then trying to flee in a getaway car parked outside.   In a prison interview with the Orlando Sentinel in 2001, Rountree said he had been a businessman in Texas but had fallen on hard times.   He said he robbed his first bank when he was about 80 because he wanted revenge against banks.   "A Corpus Christi [Texas] bank that I'd done business with had forced me into bankruptcy. I have never liked banks since," he told the Orlando Sentinel. "I decided I would get even. And I have. Banks are the easiest things in the world to rob."   Police said Rountree, who was not armed, asked a teller to stuff money into a large envelop with the word "robbery" written on it.   A witness took down the license number of his vehicle and he was arrested on a highway about 15 miles outside Abilene. He did not resist, police said.   If he is convicted, Rountree faces from two to 20 years in prison.

      Ha, sometimes I suprise myself. I already booked my next vacation and I also got my tickets this week! This time I decided not to mess with renting a car and driving over to my girlfriend; I just transfer in Atlanta and fly to Tallahassee in a hour! I fly on December the 22nd and return on January the 4th 2004.  The suprise this time came with my tickets: a booklet with all kinds of info on what I can take with me and what not. Also they made sure that insurance doesn't pay more than 10-20k in case you die due to a terrorist attack..  Ever since september 11th flying has become such a hassle. First the US government requires you to agree to give all kinds of personal information and they also ask that from the airlines. With it they can see who you are en what you are doing.  The idea that they can see what kind of meal you had on the plane (for me total irrelevant) is just too much. Big brother is watching you, that's for sure!

       urlLink CNN.com - As power slowly returns, the questions begin - Aug. 15, 2003   The above article is a nice example of how authorities always try to blame others for mistakes and problems.  Since I'm not old enough to consiously remember the poweroutage in new York in '77, this one is having more of an impact.  It was really weird seeing all the footage from a blocked up Times Square, people running around with flashlights and candles.  Good to see though that - once again - New Yorkers are not in a state of panic.  The power outtage in New York comes at a moment that we just had some outtages here in Holland as well. This was caused by a heatwave we had and people were using way to much electricity and the power plants had problems cooling their turbines.  However: it does match up with the scale  we had them in Holland.  I do agree though, the big question is: how did this happen?

      Talk about viral marketing! Recently a friend of mine told me to check out some new software that makes it possible to make VoIP calls (VoIP = Voice over IP) to anyone on the internet. Now, this has been around for years already but usually its a big hassle to set it up  especially if you have a firewall our router.  Without getting to technical; VOIP (which is also possible with MSN Messenger, Netmeeting etc.) uses so called port numbers to communicate (a port is an endpoint to a logical connection and the way a client program specifies a specific server program on a computer in a network). Usally the ports are blocked by your firewall or router. And if you have more than 1 PC behind a router, it's even almost impossible to use VOIP programsbecause of problems with NAT (Network Address Translation).  Besides that: usually these programs use some central server (i.e. Netmeeting) to find other users. Now there is a new program called  urlLink Skype , from the makers of KaZaa which promises a zero-configuration VOIP, P2P telephony solution that should work with any firewall and should be completely hassle-free. Off course I was eager to find out if it works and I downloaded it immediately.  As the makers promised, the installation was completely transparant: even the usual tweaking of the microphone and headphones didn't occur. Just a straighforward install. Then my firewall (I installed it on 2 of my 4 PC's) asked if the program was allowed to connect to the Net and off course I answered yes. Ok, so fa so good. Next I called the guy that told me to get it. Now he lives in Holland so it wasn't a real long distance call with lots of traffic on the net.  To my suprise the quality was as Skype promised: crystal clear with no delays or echo's. Next I called two other guys I know: one in Sweden and and in the UK. Again: no delay's and a crisp, crystal clear sound. We even experimented with talking to each other while downloading some huge 40meg file. Although we experienced some little hickups (much like with a GSM phone) the quality still was excellent. Later I talked to a guy that has a 64k ISDN dial-up link and it still sounded perfect. According to the makers of the program it should work even on a 33k3 modem connection. All in all: impressive, even though this is still just beta-software.  In conclusion I would like to recommend people that want to save money on their long distance phonebill to get this program. If you have a broadband connection thats on 24/7 anyway, just download it and be amazed by it! Its worth your try.  Oh, and did I mention yet that all calls are fully encrypted against evesdropping?

      CNN reports this morning that urlLink 261 music file swappers are sued  but also that an amnesty program has been unveiled. The federal lawsuits and amnesty program are the latest moves by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in its fight against illegal music file trading on the Internet. According to them filesharing is responsible for a 31 percent drop in compact disc sales since mid-2000.  So what do you do? First they tried to put the companies out of business that were making programs to share (like Napster). They did succeed in that; most filesharing sites were using a central database with users and it was easy for the RIAA to take measures against that. But then they didn't count on the ingenuity of programmers; they found a way that made it very difficult to track the people: peer-to-peer (read this article for an explanation of  urlLink P2P networks).   But now they also declared war on P2P and they are - for the first time - trying to sue individuals. Off course they know that this is just scare tactics (it's impossible to sue millions of downloaders); and it also is the kind of tactics that you'd expect from an industry that is corrupt and rotten! If you want to know more about the RIAA and the way they conduct themselves, I suggest you visit this website:  urlLink mp3 is NOT a crime.org .  For instance, according to the article  urlLink "CDs and the Scarcity Principal"  the RIAA is making prices artificially high by both controlling distribution and production.   However the RIAA is really ridiculous when it comes to explaining what and how they do to track people.  For instance: the US media has bought the RIAA's "ingenious" and "surprisingly technical" approach to identifying how to tell the difference between mp3 files which were obtained from legally purchased CDs and those which came from "pirated" sources.  What they say is this: "By comparing the fingerprints of music files on a person's computer against its library, the RIAA believes it can determine in some cases whether someone recorded a song from a legally purchased CD or downloaded it from someone else over the Internet."  Duh?  Since a digital copy of an mp3 is NOT a perfect copy of a CD track (in spite of what the industry has led so many to believe) once it's been created and placed on the Internet, each recurring copy of this file WILL be an EXACT duplicate of the original mp3. If this were not true, the RIAA's statement would fall apart at this point in the logic. If it were altered in any way, this entire wild theory about hashes and digital fingerprints would be quickly proven false.  I don't want to be overly technical here, but ask yourself this: If the mp3 was not created from a legally purchased CD, where the hell DID it come from?  What can the origin of an mp3 file be if no one possessed the physical CD? Magic? It just appeared on their computer one day? They hacked into the recording studio's computer? Broke into the studio in the dead of night and stole the master recordings?  If an mp3 was not created from a legally purchased CD, then there's only one other possible source - the record label itself, if not the artist.  Do the $4 billion a year in free promotional copies have different digital fingerprints that the legal CDs? Can you tell a shoplifted CD from one which was legally purchased?  Unless the recording industry itself is responsible for creating mp3s from the master recordings and distributing them over the Internet, ALL mp3s MUST, by definition have come from purchased CDs. To entertain any other definition is really dumb.  Anyway: I could go on and on, but I suggest reading this funny analogy called: urlLink The MPAA, RIAA, and Fellatio .  And to all RIAA jokers out there: GO F* YOURSELF!!

      This weekend I almost bought a MP3 player: the  urlLink iRiver iHP-100 . This neat little machine at first seemed some good competition for the Apple iPod. It is very nice looking and has some interesting features. For instance it has built-in radio, 16 hours playtime (or so they claim), optical in and output and you can record with it. It also supports most current formats including WMA. They sell it here at the local Media Markt for about 475 Euro. It seemed a good deal.  But now there is the brand new  urlLink Apple iPod  in 10-20 and a whopping 40 Gig!! It offers more space for less money... Way less money...  I mean: compare it: 10gig for 475 or 40 for 499!  What the iPod lacks thought:  - built-in radio  - WMA support  - Digital i/o  - 8hr play vs 16hr?   Anyway, I'll have to rethink it a bit... But I do love the looks of that iRiver. Especially the cool blue display (on both the player and the remote).

      Last September I wrote that I almost bought the iRiver iHP-100 MP3 player. One of the problems I had with it, was the fact that was just 10 gig. Well low and behold: there now is the  urlLink iRiver ihp-120  which packs 20 gig of discspace. They just released it on oktober 14th. Here is the  urlLink CNET iRiver iHP-120 Review .  Also, the price tag was a bit steep (at least here in the Netherlands): Euro 475,-. Yesterday I walked into the Media Markt (a huge electrical appliances store here) and saw they lowered the price of the iHP-100 to Euro 399,- which still is way to much since the iHP-120 is priced at U$ 399,- (list price; so you can get it for lower prices than that). With the current Euro - Dollar rate it is just not interesting to buy me this baby in the Netherlands. Although, there is a Dutch website that claims to be able to sell the player for 449,-  Euro (see:  urlLink MMport . The lowest price I have seen on a US site is $365,95 but then they do not have it in stock.  So maybe I just have to wait till I go to the US and buy me one there ;-)

      It is out now:  urlLink Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne : PC game play at its best! I just bought it yesterday and I played it already for hours! This game is truly a great combination between action and cinematics. If you played the previous Max Payne, this sequel is a must buy!  If you were diasppointed in the Matrix game, you now have a chance to see what " bullettime"  really was meant to be! This game was the first one to really capture the action style that made the movie The Matrix so great. The storyline is that of a film Noir and just adds greatly to the gameplay! This game was one of the reasons for me to buy a faster and better videocard and PC!  If you have never played it: buy Max Payne 1, play it and then get part 2.  Payne to the Max baby!

      If you read my Blog you might have noticed that I installed a pre-release of OSX Panther earlier this month. Well, it had some problems with it that I didn't anticipate. For instance, my browser (Safari off course) didn't accept any input from my keyboard anymore (which is a bit of a problem when typing an url) and it also ignored my scrollwheel on my mouse. Also it seemed that my bluetooth was completely gone. Other than it seemed to run smooth and I have to say that it also fixed some annoying problems (more on that later).  Off couse since Panther comes with Safari 1.1 it could not just reinstall Safari or bluetooth (its part of the OS). Luckily the final release (or "Goldmaster") came out a few days later and was spread very soon thru the new fast filesharing protocol called  urlLink "BitTorrent" . And low and behold: after I installed that version I had no problems with Safari anymore; is working smooth as ever. My bluetooth however is buggy as hell. I'm aleady addicted to Expose.  A lot has changed and its not only the obvious stuff like the look and feel of windows. For instance; if you close System Preferences it really closes (it stayed open in previous versions). The control panels (in system preferences) have changed to. Also Panther has a better way to switch applications (apple-tab) and together with the new versions of DVD player, Safari and others its really an improvement! Not to mention things like File Vault (encryption of your user files), Font Book (view your installed fonts),   Most impressive however, is the fact that somehow it seems they tweaked the OS so it even runs smoother on the same hardware! Thats right: with "that other OS" you need new hardware whenever they change to another version. With Panther it seems that my PowerBook G4 667 mHz runs better and not slower!  And they finally fixed one big annoying thing! With previous versions of OSX my PC would lock-up if I forgot to disconnect from a network server and just put my PowerBook in its bag. Now you just get a error and my G4 doesn't lock up anymore! Hurray!!

      Say you have shelled out some $30 for the DVD LOTR Two Towers and you want to loan out that DVD to your neighbour. Wouldn't you be mad when they return it with scratches on it? I rent a lot of DVD's and when you get them they look like crap. It is as if people use them as a frisbee or a coaster or let their dog chew on it. That's the reason I just make a bakcup of my DVD's and give the copy to whoever wants to see it. That way I make sure my DVD's stay in perfect condition.  Now, you ask yourself, how the heck would you make a backup of a dual layer DVD that can have about 9gig of data on it to a single layer DVD that has about 4.22gig of data? Well I discovered it is pretty easy. What you need is a program that can extract the movie and then processess it (i.e. shrinks it) so it wil fit on a single layer DVD-R/+R/-RW/+RW. For that reason I bought  urlLink DVD2one . It is a kick-ass program that will copy either the full DVD (with all menus) or just the movie to just one single layer DVD-R/+R/-RW/+RW. And the best news: this program is available for either Windows users and Mac OSX users!  The catch is that you need a pre-processing tool like  urlLink DVD Decrypter  to "rip" the DVD to your harddisk, since DVD2one can't do that, and also need a tool to burn the DVD like  urlLink Nero Burning Rom . But the combination of these tools is way better than the programs that supposedly do all-in-one.  The benefits of this wonderfull piece of software are:    World's fastest video compression engine. Process a movie to fit on a single recordable in a matter of 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the speed of your computer).   Makes movies-only copies. Why waste space and image quality on unnecessary intros, menus and language tracks?   Makes also full disk copies. For those who want to keep those fancy menus and intros.   Powerful join mode. Useful for putting multiple episodes of a (tv) series or joining both sides of a flipper on 1 disk.   Written from scratch, it's not based on any old code, libraries or existing opensource projects.   Time critical parts written in assembly, for the highest possible speed.   Burn the movie with your favorite recording software!   Both PC Windows and Mac OS-X versions available.    So, if you have the same idea about leaving your precious DVD's intact, I would say: shell out the money for DVD2one and never be afraid to get your DVD back as a coaster ;-)

      People who have read my Blog before, know that I have a very nice Apple Macintosh Powerbook G4 from my work. I had a choice between a regular laptop or the slick and sleek G4 - running OSX which is basically a Unix flavor OS. Well, for a technology freek like me that was a clear cut choice. I got the Mac.  I have been a real fan of OSX from day 1. It is by far the best OS in terms of stability for a laptop I have seen so far. I have run many different OS systems from DOS, WIN 3.1 up to XP Professional. I also like to experiment with Linux, which I think is growing into a great alternative OS for Intel based PC's.  Well, Apple is steadily making OSX into a prime OS for their PC's. So off course I'm very keen to get my hands on the new version of OSX: Panther. And 've got it! As I type my G4 is running in the installer in the background and I can't wait to start testing it. It's not the official release yet, but it is Build 85 and supposedly it's one of the final release candidates.  I'll keep you posted on my experiences!

      So far this weekend seems like its been an early Xmas! It't 10:45 in the morning and while I'm making this Blog - sipping some fresh java - I'm enjoying my brand new superfast ADSL... Thats right: this weekend I already got my new fast ADSL. And when I say fast, I mean FAST. Lightning fast... Blazing saddles fast... I'm talking warp 10!  Ok, you think: this guys is over-reacting. Well, my ADSL is 8(!)megabit downstream and 1(!)megabit upstream. And I downloaded a Linux .ISO image that was 660megabyte in just 16(!)minutes last night! When I had cable it took me at least 1hour and 20 minutes to do that!  The deal is I wanted to be able to run my own servers. I had Internet access by cable but then I was not allowed to run my own servers or even connect more than 1 computer to my cable (UPC). Then a friend of mine said he was getting rid of his cable (UPC) because he was getting ADSL from  urlLink Demon Internet . He said he was going to pay half what he paid for with UPC and in return he would be twice as fast! So natuarally I thought I'd check how and what the deal was. So, then I saw that for just 10 Euro a month more than I pay right now for my cable, I could get the fastest ADSL possible.  I enrolled 2 1/2 weeks ago and figured it would take at least 3 weeks or so. But when I checked the track & tace pages I saw they send me my ADSL modem already and that they also approved my line. And low and behold: yesterday morning (saturday) I got my modem, splitter etc...  So last night around 6pm I figured: what the heck, let's put that thing together. So I managed to install the splitter (a bit of a hassle) before my ISDN line (I have ISDN) and when I was ready doing that, I figured: let's see if the modem works. When I proceeded to connect my modem, it worked fine. But also I noticed that suddenly the light next to the ADSL label was burning... Well, supposedly I should have to wait for my phone company to actually activate my ADSL. But as it seemed it was already activated! And when I connected the modem to my router, I did get an IP address! Wowie!  So now I have superfast Internet!!  Like I said: it's like an early Xmas this weekend!

They provide a truly indepth view on this matter. No aspect of both OS's are missed. I would make it the "Geek-link of the week".

      Call me a gadget freak or a technology addict, but I did it again. I ordered a iRiver iHP-120 MP3 player and in anticipation of it arriving (this or the following week), I also bought the Sennheiser PXC 250 noise cancelating headphones ;-) that I want to use with this beauty. For a review of this gadget, check out the  urlLink Sennheiser PXC 250 review by PC Magazine . As I write this (at my work - mind you) I'm listening to a soundtrack from the movie "Trainspotting" (Dark Train by Underworld) and I have it cranked up with the noise cancelation turned on. It blocks out the irritating sounds of the AC at my work more than adequate! So I bet I will be enjoying it when I fly to the US later this year!  Only bad thing about it is that I probably paid a bit to much for it, since I know see all kinds of adds where it sells for about 10-15% less than what I paid :-( Anyway: back to the iHP 120 that I ordered. I found it was way too expensice until I stumbled upon a way to buy one cheaper. The makers of DAPreview did some communal purchase action and so I got the opportunity to buy it for at least 60 Euro less than the cheapest store here in Holland. I know: if I import one from the States, it might be chaper, but (import)taxes will even out the advantages.  Anyway; I keep you posted on when I get it! In the mean time enjoy  urlLink this comparison between the iHP-100 and  the Philips HDD100 . from DAPreview...

      Ha, caught you off guard huh? You're wondering: what the hell does that mean? Well, for those nog familiar with Dutch traditions, instead of Santa Claus, we have "Sinterklaas". And guess what: basically they are the same! You even pronounce the names almost the same.  I don't know the exact origin of Santa Claus or Sinterklaas real well, but supposedly he was a figure that lived in the 4th century a.c. in Myra, Turkey as a bischop. According to the legend he saved his village from starvation, resurrected three kids that were dead, and gave gifts to the poor people. He supposedly died on December 6th 343 a.c. In 1087 his remains were moved to Bari in Italy (but for some reason in Dutch tradition he came form Spain).   The fact that he gave gifts etc. became a tradition that we Dutch celebrate in December 5th; "pakjesavond". Kids that behaved good all year get presents and the ones that were not so good are supposedly put into a bag and get whipped with a stick and then are taken back to Spain by the black helpers of Sinterklaas ("Zwarte Pieten").  Anyway: this goofy tradition has been around for many years and almost every Dutch kid grew up with this myth, only to discover that Sinterklaas doesn't exist and it all was just a big scam.  So how did the Americans wind up with Santa Claus? Well supposedly an American preacher called Clemet C. Moore described the red suit that "Sinterklaas"  was wearing, in a poem called " 't Was the night before Christmas"  and thus introduced the Dutch legend in the United States of America. And in 1773 the Dutch introduced him as St. A Claus.  So, the truth of the matter is that the modern Santa Claus is a conglomeration of sources, a legendary being that has evolved over the years. Along the way, pre-Christian legends, the story of St. Nicholas, Dutch immigrants to America, Washington Irving, Clement Moore, Thomas Nast, and the Coca-Cola company, all made their contributions.  If you want to read a very good indepth piece on it, check out:  urlLink The Origin of Santa Claus and the Christian Response to Him .

      Wow, it has been an extremely busy month of November here at my work. So busy I didn't even have time to follow up on my story from November 9th. I didn't even have time to post my experiences with my iRiver iHP-120 or my superfast ADSL. All because because I was so wrapped up in my work with deadlines and very demanding customers.  On the bright side: it's now December 1st and I will be with my honey in exactly 21 days ;-) But untill then I still have a busy schedule since I have to wrap up some stuff at my work.  But back to the iHP-120 ;-) I'm listening to it right now; some track called Trance Nation 2002 in MP3 format. I have about 10 gig of music on it and I still have 10 left so I can really use it to the fullest. I put all my favourite music on it and I have room left for some regular files. It's very handy that I can use it as a portable harddisk as well. with the USB 2.0 interface transferring files is a breeze and even with USB 1.1 it's pretty acceptable.  Anyway: the last week was a low point as far as it goes with health etc. Even though I didn't call in sick I had a bad cold and I was having a slight fever. I guess that pure willpower kept me on my feet. It could not have been worse timing for me to be sick, so i decided to just take a few extra aspirins and bite the bullit. I haven't called in sick this year, except for 2 days in July when I came back from my Paris trip.  Anyway: it's 10 past 17:00 and I'm ready to pack up my stuff. Tomorrow I have some dorky training from my work (some sales-training) and I already know I'll be in a coma after the first hour or so. I better go prepare for that mentally.  Blog you later!

      It's a grey monday morning and I'm sitting at home behind my PC. I'm not at work because I have a rather irritating problem: I can hardly walk because I hurt my left foot. So what happened?  Well, since two weeks I'm jogging/running again. I signed up for this as part of my news years resolutions. The goal is to run the 10km on May 2nd when we have the marathon of Almere. I haven't done anything fysical for the last 2 years so off course I have no stamina whatsoever. We train two times a week: wednesday evening and sunday morning. Last wednesday we did a so called "interval training" which is meant to enhance your stamina. Afterwards my foot was already hurting a bit, but I knew I had 3 day to recover, so yesterday morning I just started to run again.  I had a few hestitations but I started out running. We were supposed to run for 30 minutes, but after 15 minutes I just had to stop. I could not run anymore and even walking hurt like hell. Afterwards I could barely drive home cause even pushing the clutch hurt me. Luckily its only a few minutes drive.  However: I bought a brand new printer ( urlLink Lexmark i3 ) saturday, but it turned out a DOA. So I had to  go exchange it. The shop were I bought it (Media Markt) luckily has a huge parking lot next to it so I didn't have to walk that far. After taking a few painkillers (generic over the counter stuff) I just embarked and went to exchange it.  I always am a bit hestitant to complain about pain and such since it's so relative (my girlfriend has chronic pain), but let me tell you; you really appreciate the fact that you can walk and run once you feel how much such a simple task can hurt. So when I got home and installed my printer, I was happy to put my foot up and start relaxing.

      Well, it seems a long time ago that I “blogged” something. And you’re right. Since December 6th I haven’t had much time to do anything an now I just returned from a 14 days vacation in Florida with my girlfriend Carrie.  Right now its 0:06 and I have a bad jetlag. This is the reason I’m writing this entry in my nice Blog. I guess I will tell you guys all about my trip later. For now I’m getting a melatonin capsule and hope that it will help to put my biological timer back on track.  Lucky for me I have the week off so it’s not that bad a start at all.  Oh, did I wish all you guys & girls out there a happy new year yet? I didn’t? Well: here you go:  Happy New Year!

      Today it was February 29th; a leap day in a leap year. And for a lot of people the only time in 4 years they can celebrate their birthday. A  leap year is a year in which an extra day in added to the calendar in order to synchronize it with the seasons. Since the tropical year is 365.242190 days long, a leap year must be added roughly once every four years (four times the fractional day gives ). In a leap year, the extra day (known as a leap day) is added at the end of February, giving it 29 instead of the usual 28 days.  In the Gregorian calendar currently in use worldwide (except perhaps the Russian and Iranian calendars), there is a leap year every year divisible by four except for years which are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. Therefore, the year 2000 was a leap year, but the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not. The complete list of leap years in the first half of the 21st century is therefore 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032, 2036, 2040, 2044, and 2048.  The extra rule involving centuries is an additional correction to make up for the fact that one extra day every four years is slightly too much correction (). This scheme results in the vernal equinox gradually shifting its date between March 19 and 21, being shifted once every leap year, and then being abruptly shifted in non-leap centuries.  Confusing? Well I know I was when I read this.  Anyway: I will not have a chance to write my Blog on Februari 29th until 4 years from now: 2008. Wow. I'l be 41 then.  Some trivia: In any ten year period, what's the minimum number of leap years? What's the maximum?  Answer:   Minimum: 1 (2097-2107 would only have one leap year, 2104! 2100 is not a leap year (as explained before). Maximum: 3 (1996-2006 would have 1996, 2000, 2004)   Also: 2004 is a leap year, with 29 days in February. February has five Sundays - it starts and ends on a Sunday. Between 1904 and 2096, leap years repeat every 28 years which means that the last time February had 5 Sundays was in 1976 and next time will be in 2032.   Have a nice leap year!

      Ok, this is a Dutch only blogpost... It's about the chaos on the Dutch roads following some snow. Only in februari 1999 there was more chaos: 975 kilometres of traffic jams.   Sneeuwval leidt tot extreem lange files    Uitgegeven: 26 februari 2004 07:25  Laatst gewijzigd: 26 februari 2004 11:43     DRIEBERGEN -  De hevige sneeuwval heeft donderdag tijdens de ochtendspits tot extreem lange files geleid. Omstreeks 08.00 uur stonden er 63 files met een totale lengte van 860 kilometer, aldus de meldkamer van het Verkeerscentrum Nederland. Alleen op 8 februari 1999 was de verkeersellende nog groter: 975 kilometer file.   Ook de Nederlandse Spoorwegen ondervonden veel hinder, vooral bij de hoofdstad. Tegen achten liep het treinverkeer naar en van Amsterdam Centraal volkomen vast.   Na enige tijd kwam het langzaam aan weer op gang. Een woordvoerder van ProRail sprak van "een blizzardachtige situatie", waardoor op veel plaatsen wisselstoringen ontstonden. "Het is bar en boos."    Schiphol   De luchthaven Schiphol ondervond ook hinder. Om 07.00 uur kon slechts één baan worden gebruikt. Twee uur later waren alle drie banen weer in gebruik. Tijdens piekuren heeft Schiphol drie banen nodig. Intercontinentale vluchten hadden het minst last van de vertragingen. Wel waren er toestellen die naar andere Europese luchthavens moesten uitwijken en vielen er vluchten uit.    Files   De langste files stonden op de autoweg Amsterdam-Den Bosch. Richting hoofdstad stond er omstreeks 08.30 uur 57 km file tussen Deil en Holendrecht en in omgekeerde richting tussen Holendrecht en Culemborg 43 km. Ook op de A12 tussen Den Haag en Arnhem was het motto langzaam rijdend en stilstaand verkeer. Tussen Veenendaal en De Meern stond 39 km, tussen Gouda en Lunetten 35 km. Om half tien was de totale lengte van de files bijna gehalveerd tot 388 km.    KNMI   Het KNMI had een weerwaarschuwing uitgegeven. In heel het land zou het door sneeuw en bevriezing glad zijn. Die waarschuwing geldt ook nog na de ochtendspits. In de loop van de dag kunnen er nieuwe sneeuwbuien vanaf de Noordzee het land binnentrekken.   De weggebruikers hebben zich volgens de ANWB goed aan de omstandigheden aangepast. Tot 08.50 uur hadden er volgens de KLPD 75 aanrijdingen op de hoofdwegen voorgedaan. De ANWB meldde dat de Wegenwacht het niet drukker had dan normaal.   De KLPD gaf omstreeks half zeven het advies thuis te blijven als dat kon. Door de sneeuwval waren op dat moment de wegen praktisch onbegaanbaar. Korte tijd later werd dit advies ingetrokken.

      Well It's one of those days again: one inch of snow, slippery roads and miles and miles of traffic jams. Obviously I am not trying to get to work since even the Dutch police caution everyone "to "stay home if possible". Luckily I'm in a position that all I need for my work is an Internet connection and e-mail ;-)  Well mostly: sometimes I have to admit that being in the office is more handy, but let's just say that for now I'm happy being home: I've turned up the heat, have some fresh coffee and some lounge music in the background...

      Ok, I know what I want for my birthday! I want the ultimate GEEK wear: a ScotteVest, and more specific the  urlLink ScottE TEC Sport Jacket . Yes thats right, this blazer makes James Bond look like a moron.  I always have found it hard to carry all my stuff with me. At least women have a handbag they can stuff with their toys. But we men are always stuck out there with our wallets, cellphones, pda's, MP3 players, sunglasses and what have you. And if you stuff your regular blazer - like I do - you will find your pockets start ripping like nothing before.  So this baby is a real good invention. In fact  urlLink ScotteVest  has much more functional and innovative wear. Yep, it seems that that even President Bush has one. Normally a reason NOT to get it, but hell, for once he had a good idea!  Now I only need to figure out what size I need...

      It's tax season and I need to finish my tax form by April 1st. Luckily in Holland our "Belastingdienst" (the Dutch IRS) is fully automated so I can just fill out some electronic tax form and just push a button: presto!  When I compare this with other countries (i.e. the USA) we are much more automated. For instance electronic banking: I have been doing that for 7 or 8 years now. My girlfriend can't do it that way yet (at least not as easy). Weird because the concept of electronic banking and using the internet for it, is a concept that came from the USA...   Movies galore   Right now I'm in a movie copying frenzy: I have lots of DVD's lying around that need to be copied. Ever since I got my new PC with DVD burner it really made my collection grow. Right now I burn most DVD's first on DVD-RW(+/-) so I can see if it is working right, then I just burn it to a DVD-R (or +R).  Lined up are: Triggermen, Master and Commander, Kill Bill Vol. 1, Den of Lions, Blind Horizon, Crime Spree and last but not least Matrix Revolutions.  Speaking of Matrix Revolutions: it really sucked! I mean: why the hell did they kill both heroes? The whole movies series was evolving around the love story between Neo and Trnity! Ok, they saved mankind (Zion), but why not end the series with some positive message where boy gets girl? Although: the silly thing is, that they do leave open the possibility for Neo to return (afterall; it is not all clear if he died or not and even the Oracle says they "very probabaly" will see him again).  Anyways: the effects were awesome but the ending did kill the good feeling I had about it.

      A word of advice: if you plan on using Norton Systemworks 2003, do *NOT* install Norton Goback. If you mess up your system, it will make thing WORSE than actually help you!  I just spend the last 4 hours trying to fix my sisters and brother in law's PC that they bought only 3 weeks ago. When they bought it, I loaded it with stuff like Norton and some DVD burning tools. I also installed Goback. I figured that it would give better protection in case my sis (or her kids) would mess up their PC.  However, this tuesday the PC crashed (XP Home edition) and after that it started to get into a vicious circle of rebooting, starting and the rebooting again. Off course they tried the restore option that Goback suggests. However that just didn't work and they called me.  So when I inspected the PC I saw that after Goback gave its prompt (press space for restore options), it just didn't start and would reboot again. First I suspected that somehow the MBR got damaged or just the NTloader wouldn't work.  So I booted from the XP cd, went into the recovery console and just used the FIXBOOT command and then the FIXMBR command. That didn't work and by doing so I also wiped the special Goback bootstrap. I didn't know it yet, but that just put me into more shit. Somehow the driveletter were XP was appeared as I:\ and not C:\. This started me to suspect it was that damn Goback because 1 time I had the same problem with a W2K machine that had Quarterdeck Bootmagic installed.  Using the recovery console I figured out that the volume (not the partition) wasn't accesible anymore. I then used PEbuilder to make a special XP boot CD with some diagnostic tools but again: I could not acces the volume. Even after making it the active volume.  Then I decided to just use Partion Magic to examine the harddisk. Well there it was: the harddisk wasn't accesible for this program as well. I decided to look up the fysical info for the harddisk: it turned out to be a type 44.  So, using google I figured out what was going on. Goback loads its own MBR version and also changes the identifier for the harddisk from 07 (NTFS) to 44 (RAW). And neither XP or most tools can access it! Or so they think because in reality its just the identifier and it's not really type 44 disk.  Now all I had to do is change it back to 7. But how? I looked again with google and came upon an article: it seemed that a tool called ptedit.exe could do this. And I had it since I have Partition Magic! Praise the Lord!  So about 4 hrs and a lot of sweat later, I managed to fix the problem simply by two clicks and a OK button, and it just restored XP as it used to be with all files etc. intact.  Needless to say I immediately removed Goback. Norton really fucked up there! They should not mess with the damn harddisk identifier!  You have been warned!

      This morning, on my way to work I got caught up in slowing traffic near the point were the A6 motorway changes into the A1. While I was slowing down I noticed the red X above one of the lanes and before I even could think aloud "probably an accident", I got passed by an ambulance zooming by with all lights and sirens on. Obviously the accident just happened. After a minute or so I got close to the spot where it all happened. Just 100 yards before I got there, I could hear the dreaded sound of a helicopter, wich means there was a severe trauma going on and the trauma team got called in.  When I finally drove by the spot itself I saw three cars piled up but that wasn't the reason why the trauma team was there: about a hundred feet futher a motorcycle was piled up into a heap of scrap and near it the medics from the ambulance were holding the driver's head stable. Although I only saw it for a second it seemed that the guy still had all his extremities attached (once I drove by a motorcycle accident where the guy got decapitated). So it was unclear how much damage he had.  It send some chills down my spine: I never liked motorbikes just because you are so damn vunerable if anything happens. No airbags, no cage surrounding you, no rollbar etc. etc.. sure: it might be a fast way to get form A to Z and during summer it probably is one of the coolest ways to get around (besides a convertible of cabriolet as we call it), but the chances of surrviving an accident are very slim.  The problem is that the last few weeks traffic is getting slower (hollidays are over and people are returning from their sky trips etc.) and the weather better. So lot's of people are getting their motorbikes out and try to elude the traffic by zooming by. A lot of the drivers are unexperienced or take to many risks trying to pass the traffic jams too fast.  Well, I saw the result of that this morning. Again.

      I just heared a very amusing story from a collegue that travels a lot to the US. Last summer he went to visit some relatives in Pensylvania. He met some other Dutch people on the plane that traveled with him from the airport to this little town. On their way, in a rental car, they accidently ignored a stop sign and got pulled over by a squad car.  The officer asked his traveling companion, who was driving the car at that moment, for his drivers licence. He also asked him why he thought he got  pulled over. Since in Holland you can ignore a stop sign when there is no traffic coming, he answered that he didn't know. When the officer explained the situation (you always stop at a stop sign even when you don't see anyone for miles around), the guy aplogized to the officer: "Sorry hoor, I didn't knew that".  The cop got agitated and asked him "What did you just say?"  so again he said: "Well, I said: sorry hoor, I didn't knew that it was illegal." The cop got even more angry now and asked him to step out of the vehicle. By now his traveling companion started to wonder what the hell was going on and why tyhe cop was getting angry.  Then suddenly he realized it: "sorry hoor"  is a typical Dutch expression. When you pronounce it in a certain way (depending on the Dutch accent you have) it sounds like: "Sorry, WHORE". which is, off course, pretty insulting!  Luckily he could explain it to the cop who had a good sense of humor and could even laugh at the situation.

      This past week Wednesday evening (March 31st) turned out to be a scary evening. After I went out for dinner (Chinese) I arrived at my home at about 8:45pm. I changed clothes and slipped into my training suit and started to zap through the channels (nothing on as usual). Then at about 9:15pm my doorbell was ringing. I could here from the sound that someone was actually at my door and not downstairs (it rings differently and my camera turns on). So I went to see who it was.  There was my next-door neighbor from number 109 (I'm 111). She was standing in the hallway with her girlfriend who was holding her baby (about 9 months old or so I estimate) and she had this panicky look on her face when she gasped out of breath: "Fire! I have a fire in my kitchen, what do I do?". She was standing there holding her cell phone which still had the power plug attached to it, dialing 112 (the Dutch equivalent to 911).  When I looked behind her into her hallway I could see and smell the smoke coming out of there, but there were no flames - yet. I didn't panic at all but asked her what it was that was burning. She explained that they smelled something and then when they looked they saw the kitchen was filled with smoke and it came from a little pan she had left on with some oil in it.  Anyway I told her that it was best to go outside and warn the other neighbors on her way out. I went back into my apartment, think up what I could do. Grab some belongings? Get my cats? Obviously if the fire would go big I could do nothing about it. I also called 112 - just to be sure they got the call - and after that  I just unplugged all my computers, my TV stereo and other stuff and got my shoes on, grabbed my mobile and my keys and went outside.  On my way out I passed some cops (they patrol on bikes here) and told them they should go to 109. They also started to bang on the doors and evacuated everyone. Two minutes later I was outside with about half of the other people from my apartment (12 families live there).   The firemen arrived and just rolled out there hoses and went in. From the street I could not see any flames at all so in had a feeling it wouldn't be to bad. After all: we cook electrical here and she didn't have a vent above her stove. Usually those vents catch on fire and make things worse. A few minutes later I saw them open some windows and also the kitchen window. I could see the ceiling had turned all black from the fire.  They had everything under control but I could not go back yet: they examined the air first and after another 20 minutes or so I could go back in again. Boy did it STINK there!  Luckily no harm done no casualties and I could start up everything again....  Off course I am going to install some smoke alarms and check on my insurance!    Coffee Junkie  Ok, I admit it: I'm a coffee junkie. I have been using a regular coffee machine for some time now, but if I just want 1 cup I have to use instant coffee which I dislike. So this week (thursday April 1st) I decided to treat myself and I bought the latest invention around. A  urlLink Senseo Crema machine .  Great coffee and you can get a cup within 3 minutes! Downside is I do drink more coffee now and I suspect it's not so healthy.

      I just realized that Blogging (before it was called like that) has been around for quite a few years. In fact, they were called .plan files ("dot plan").   A .plan is basically a file which a user on a UNIX system (well, generally UNIX or Linux systems) can put into their "home" directory. This file is there so that the user can describe themselves, write a log, keep a list of things they have to do etc. Using a utility called "finger" it is possible to have a server return the contents of this file by passing it the user's email address (i.e.: "finger john@idsoftware.com")  During the development of the PC game Quake, programmer John Carmack of id Software started using his .plan file to keep the users updated of his progress. This idea snowballed until the whole id development team were using them, and many other developers followed.  Many important events have been first announced in .plan files, from staff changes and child births to the first mention of new games (like Quake III Arena or Doom III).  Since this so called "finger" protocol got out of fashion (mostly because it was targeted a lot by hackers) it isn't used that much anymore and steadily got replaced by .plan files that were published on the WWW and subsequently called "blogging". But thats just a new word for the same thing in my opinion.  A typical .plan from John Carmack looked like this: John Carmack Feb 23 2000, 18:41:51 (GMT) johnc@idsoftware.com id Software - Lead Programmer 	  Name: John Carmack Email: johnc@idsoftware.com Description: Programmer Project: Quake 3 Arena ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2/23/00 ------- This is a public statement that is also being sent directly to Slade at QuakeLives regarding http://www.quakelives.com/main/ql.cgi?section=dlagreement&file=qwcl-win32/  I see both sides of this. Your goals are positive, and I understand the issues and the difficulties that your project has to work under because of the GPL. I have also seen some GPL zealots acting petty and immature towards you very early on (while it is within everyone's rights to DEMAND code under the GPL, it isn't necessarily the best attitude to take), which probably colors some of your views on the subject.  We discussed several possible legal solutions to the issues.  This isn't one of them.  While I doubt your "give up your rights" click through would hold up in court, I am positive that you are required to give the source to anyone that asks for it that got a binary from someone else. This doesn't provide the obscurity needed for a gaming level of security.  I cut you a lot of slack because I honestly thought you intended to properly follow through with the requirements of the GPL, and you were just trying to get something fun out ASAP. It looks like I was wrong.  If you can't stand to work under the GPL, you should release the code to your last binary and give up your project. I would prefer that you continue your work, but abide by the GPL.  If necessary, I will pay whatever lawyer the Free Software Foundation reccomends to pursue this.

      A dream has ended... Portugal beat us 2-1. We didn't even score ourselves (a Portugese player scored for us)... It was an exciting game, I was on the edge of my seat, but they were to strong for us. Portugal, who is hosting the European Soccer tournament really had the benefit of playing in their own country. Almost every decision the referee made was in the advantage of the Portugese :-(  Oh well, back to normal again. The Portugese will face off with winner of the match between the Tsjechs and the Greek...

      Wow, another barrier taken: we beat Sweden! After a breathtaking 90 minutes we still had a Mexican stand-off. So we had 30 minutes more playtime (extension). After that it was penalties. If there is one other trauma in the Dutch soccer history, its taking penalties. The last 4 times we had to do this we lost. Basically our team sucks at penalties. So everyone in Holland was holding their breath when we had to continue.  But this time we we kept it  cool. Cooler than ice. Our goallie, Edwin van der Sar, was undoubted the hero of the match when he stopped one of penalties from the Swedes. I was watching the match with my sister and brother-in-law and it really was very exciting. The new generation of players did not suffer from the traumas from the past. Van Nistelrooy, Makaay and Robben all did their job. The only one missing a penalty for the Dutch was Cocu: he hit the goalpost.  Pff, next we have to beat Portugal in the semi finals on the 30th...

      It's been a stormy day here in Holland. Literally: a rare summer storm sweeps across our nation today. Just as our Dutch soccer team swept the Latvians of the field: 3-0. But, as I mentioned before: this time it was not in our hands: if the Germans would win from the Tsjechs, we would loose anyway. But today the impossible became possible. Even though the Tsjechs played with, what is considered a complete B-team, they beat the Germans 2-1!  It could not be closer than this. And to tell the truth, it was a nervewrecking match. As always the Germans had a very good comeback in the second half of the match. In Holland its a well known fact that the Germans are never beat until the whistle blows and the referee says its over. I couldn't help myself zapping from the Dutch match to the Germans, every ten seconds or so.  It is only fair to say that, in all reality, the Latvians never should have been a problem for the Dutch. They played even poorer than the Dutch throughout the tournament. But in reality the Dutch haven't played that well either. Last Saturday they finally played a bit like they should, but we still lost. Today we dominated although there were a few scary moments. Particular after the break when the Latvians had three big chances.  When I zapped back and forth between the two matches I got more and more anxious - to my own surprise. Usually I'm not a huge soccer fan, but this kind of important match is always a different experience.  Having said that: if I would have to make one prediction, I would predict that it would not be surprising at all if the Tsjechs will become the next European Soccer Champions of 2004. They do have a hell of a team and a really smart coach.

      Today is "our" last chance as a soccer nation to go for the title of European soccer Champion of 2004. After a 1:1 stand-off against our German "friends", we played a good match against the Tjechs. Even though we started with a 2:0 advantage, we managed to loose the match 2-3. Mostly due to a very questionable player change from our Dutch coach "Dick" Advocaat.  So today we need to win big from Letland if we want to proceed to the quarter finals. However, if the Germans win from the Tsjechs, we still loose because we won't have enough points in our Group D (we only have 1 point, number 1 are the Tjechs with 6 points).   In other words: half of the outcome is chance, half of it is our deal.  I, for one, will not shed a tear when we loose. The way I see it we do not deserve to go on to the quarter finals since we have not displayed any outstanding or special qualities. The big suprise of this tournament are the smaller countries that normally do not score to well. I'm talking about Letland, the Tjechs and even Portugal.  Looking at the scores so far (not that I am an expert), my prediction is that the semi-final probably will have the French, English, Sweden and the Tsjechs...  Too be continued....

      Ok, this is NOT a joke, I repeat: this is NOT a joke! Remember Harry Potter's invisibility cloak? Well, a professor at the University of Tokyo has created an optical camouflage system that makes anyone wearing a special reflective material seem to disappear. Here's how: a video camera records the real-life scenery behind the subject, transmits that image to a front-mounted projector, which then displays the scene on the reflective material.  It's the darnest thing I ever have seen: It's like the special effects you see in movies for real! I admit I thought it was a hoax or a joke, but as you can see for yourself at the following links it really exists! Off course the technology is still in its early stages, but anyone can see that its just a matter of time before it really will be applicable (the japanese professor thinks it will be around 2008).  Check it out:   urlLink TIME Magazine: Coolest Inventions 2003, Invisible Technology .   urlLink cool video's of the invisability cloak .  Again: reality seems to catch up with fantasy...

      Let's face it: Microsoft Internet Explorer is the standard browser for 98% of this world. But there are a lot of issues I have with MSIE in regards to what other browsers have to offer. For instance: I'm completely addicted to tabbed browsing (something I started to like once I tried out Opera). Also, built-in ad-blocking and pop-up blocking (also something Opera offered years ago) is a nice option.  For those looking for an alternative to MSIE, look no further: just download  urlLink Avant Browser, a tabbed browser with Flash Filter, Popup Stopper, Cleaner, Web Search and more.  It just does what I want and adds some good options. It's just MSIE with smart features! And best off all: it's free! No ad-ware no nags, nothing.

      With the European soccer cup in full swing, some memories pop up about the famous – or should I say: infamous – World soccer cup final of 1974. Ever since WW II there has been some animosity between the Dutch and the Germans. It’s the same kind of animosity that exists between the British and the French (although their history goes farther back then ours).  Back in ’74 the Dutch soccer-team definitely was the underdog of the tournament. We never got far and usually we stranded way before the semi- or quarterfinals. But that year it was different. We had the best teams in years (most notably we had Johan Cruyf, the Dutch soccer player who is as famous as the Brazilian Pele was in his days). We managed to make it into the semi-finals in which we defeated the Brazilians (the number 1 favorite for the world title).  We had a complete new system/concept in playing, which was dubbed “total soccer” that also involved a new rule that we used to our benefit regarding “off site”.  Anyway: the final was a thriller of epic proportions: Netherlands vs Germany. Even though I was only 7 years old at that time, even I still remember the outcome of the match.  After just 3 minutes we got a penalty against the Germans and scored. So it was 1:0 for us. We played liked lions but in the second half the Germans managed to get a penalty as well: 1:1. And, in the last minutes of the game they got another goal and we lost 1:2.  We all felt like the Germans had stolen out title! The Dutch team played at a constant pace from the start of the tournament and had proved that the system and the players were a perfect match. Our coach, Rinus Michels aka ‘The General’ aka ‘The Sphinx’ had turned a bunch of players into a machine that ran perfectly.  All in all it was a trauma the Dutch would never loose and even 30 years later there are hordes of people that still remember the ordeal.  It wasn’t until the European Soccer Cup of ’88 that we regained a bit of our self-esteem by becoming the European Soccer Champions.  If only we could become the World Champions!

      I just spend another weekend being totally absorbed by my computers. It all started when I wanted to upgrade my main game computer to Norton System Works 2003 and also installing Norton Internet Security Professional.  Now, I have had my fair share of computer problems with Norton (if you can’t remember check the March 26 blog called  urlLink Norton Goback, Go Away ) and this wasn’t going to be any different. First I just tried to upgrade. This didn’t work well. Then I tried to uninstall all Norton stuff. That didn’t work well either.  After going to the usual registry hell, I just gave up and tried to go with the free-ware versions for my firewall and virus scanner. But that gave some other troubles. I used AntiVir-personal (you should too: it’s for free and it works good), but for some damn reason it just didn’t install right.  It took me a few hours literally to hack it. Now it’s running and so is ZoneLabs ZoneAlarm.  Bah! I just hate PC’s sometimes. Word of advice here: stay away from Norton 2004. 2003 versions work better and with less hassle!

      Why is it always so hard to start working again after a vacation? I came back this Saturday from Florida, and starting this Monday was pretty annoying. I kind off walked in like a zombie and even three mugs of coffee later, I didn’t feel very alert.  It also turned out that some people I work with suddenly are on a holiday too, even though they said they were not going for a while. Annoying too, because its not like I can decide on all kinds of things without conferring with them first.  Anyway, tomorrow its Wednesday and we are at the middle of the week: only two more days to the weekend. By then I should have my blank DVD’s (I ordered 100 since I ran out of them) and also my Maxtor OneTouch 250 firewire/USB 2.0 external hard disk. I ordered it today because I really need to backup my PC and want to store some files.

      Jet lag is a bitch. Flying back from Carrie is always the worst; I loose a day and it feels just like that. When I arrived yesterday, I felt pretty ok. I slept for one and a half hour and stayed up till 11:30pm which is good I think. But this morning I feel like I have a bad hangover. I got up at 10am after sleeping real good (I only woke up twice) had a large coffee, but still it feels like my engine hasn't started.  I guess what adds to the jetlag this time, is the fact that I had a 9 hour lay-over at Atlanta. So basically I was up at 5:45am and we rushed to the airport (God, I hate saying goodbye) and I arrived at Atlanta at 8:30am and had to wait till 5:40pm. So I walked around the airport (Atlanta is huge) and shopped around a bit (bought myself yet another watch, this time a nice Nautica).  So once I got on the plane I was pretty tired. As always I don't sleep real well on a plane, I kind of doze off for a few mintues I guess. They showed two movies I enjoyed: "Fifty first dates" (so funny!) and "Man on Fire". Both were good entertainment.  Anyway, I just put my  urlLink vacation photo's online  online for you guys to enjoy. Gee, I do like New Orleans but next time we should go there when its not +98 degrees (36 celcius). Then we can go see more of the town without melting like some popsicle ;-)  Starting work tomorrow again: brrr, I don't feel like that at all. I better chill out some more today ;-)  Blog you later!

       Car trouble (1)   &nbsp;  The last week of my vacation here started with some anxious moments. My baby was supposed to go to work at 8:30 am, but less than 2 minutes after she left her home, she pulled back in to the carport. The car was running real weird and it didn't even want to stop running when she turned the key off.  &nbsp;  A little panic struck me (and her too I'm sure). One bad thing is, that I know absolutely nothing about car mechanics. I do understand how they work and stuff, but whenever I pull the hood open I can barely distinguish the battery from the other parts. Sure, I know how to fill up the screenwash or put some more oil in there, but other than that I'm pretty lost.  &nbsp;  Now, my brother-in-law on the other hand is a bit of a car wizz. Lets put it this way: what I know about computers, he knows about cars. He is rebuilding an old BMW 3-series right now, and he really is doing a great job.  &nbsp;  So, when Carrie pulled up there I could only give her a sheepish look and try to think what the heck might be wrong with the car. I checked (so I thought) all the fluids, and they seemed ok. Now there was one little thing that should have warned us: the engine had been running pretty hot and when I pulled the hood open (before we left for New Orleans), I saw some smoke coming of the engine (oil burning). Also, there was a huge puddle of what looked like water and oil beneath the car under the carport.  &nbsp;  However: since we checked the oil before (when we left for New Orleans) it seemed like that could not&nbsp; be oil, but radiator fluid - or something. Carrie told me that the puddle started to grow when she had her oil changed at Superlube some weeks ago. We talked a couple of times about it over the phone and I suggested she would check if the bolt that is underneath the car was screwed on the right way.  &nbsp;  Anyway, we decided it was best to have the car towed to Action Auto and have them look at the problem. I feared the worst, since it sounded like a major problem (maybe a belt or something). So after waiting for more than one hour for the tow truck, the guy asked us what was wrong with the car and checked the oil again.&nbsp;And sure enough:&nbsp;there was no oil left in the engine.  &nbsp;  Now, as everyone knows, that is a sure way to kill your engine. So we could only hope that this wasn't the end of the car. Luckily Carrie drove it only for 2-3 minutes. Any longer and it would have died for sure. So after the tow truck left she took Zach's (her son) car to work.  &nbsp;   Mosquito cost   &nbsp;  While waiting for the verdict on the car, I mowed&nbsp;Carrie's front lawn. Since I had taken a nap for 1 hour (hey, I'm on vacation you know) it was about 12:30 when&nbsp;I started to do that. The middle of the day and probably the hottest moment. Boy, I think I lost a gallon of sweat there. The grass was pretty high and the lawnmower - that otherwise works great - died on it about 20 times. And sure enough: the mosquito's really started to follow&nbsp;me around and were trying to eat me alive. They even follow me around while I'm in the pool!  &nbsp;  Funny thing is: I never ever had a problem with mosquito's - in Holland that is. Ever since I visited Florida for the first time however, it seems that I am allergic for the American version of this pesky little critter. And what a drag it is: once bitten the bite mark turns into a huge purple/red spot and itches like crazy. I know a thing or two about how mosquito's work and I am sure I am allergic to the stuff they inject into my bloodstream in order to prevent my blood from clogging up. It works to good I guess, so that's why it looks so bad.&nbsp;Not to mention&nbsp;it itches like hell.  &nbsp;   Car Trouble (2)   &nbsp;  Finally Carrie called me and told me what the&nbsp;verdict was on the car. First she tricked me and said it was 4500 dollars to get it fixed, but then she explained that in actuality it was two bolts (or nuts) on the engine that weren't tightened up enough, so the motor had been leaking oil all the time! The big puddle under the car, after all, was oil. The charged some 80 dollars for fixing it. Not bad, considering things could have been a lot worse!  &nbsp;   Indian Dinner   &nbsp;  The day ended with us having a&nbsp;nice dinner at Curry and Wine. "Us" included Carrie's girlfriend Denise. Denise used to work at the same place Carrie is working. While Denise was having some vegetarian food, Carrie and I chowed down on some chicken curry. I had the spiciest version of the Chicken Korma, but compared with what I am used to it was actually the mildest dish I had in a while. Nice, but not as spicy I was into.  &nbsp;  Afterwards we dropped a video at Blockbuster (Mystic River - excellent movie) and proceeded&nbsp;&nbsp;home to watch the movie Monster. One of the saddest movies (next to Mystic River and Monsters Ball) I have seen lately. And so ended the day.

      I just came back from New Orleans after a three day visit there with my girlfriend Carrie. Boy, it was a blast although way too hot for me - and suprisingly also too hot for Carrie (her being from Florida)..&nbsp; &nbsp;  To our suprise New Orleans looks a lot like some European cities we visited. Mostly I could see a resemblence to Paris in some ways, which off course isn't surprising since New Orleans exactly means wat the name says: its&nbsp; a&nbsp;new version of the French city Orleans. &nbsp; Anyway, we went&nbsp;around town, had dinner in a fancy restaurant&nbsp;(Oliviers), went to Acme Oysters, seen the Missisippi river, the Audubom Aquarium and&nbsp;last but&nbsp;not least, we gambled some money away in Harrah's Casino. All in all it&nbsp;was a fun time and we&nbsp;stayed in a great Hotel (Iberville Suites) for a good price. &nbsp; I will be putting up&nbsp;some pictures from the trip shortly.

      I guess everyone remembers that feeling you got when you were a little kid and it was just 1 day before your birthday and you were waiting for that 1 gift you wanted. That feeling of anticipation that gave you little butterflies in your tummy. Well, even though I'm 37, I still get that feeling from time to time. Today it's because I am expecting the arrival of a new toy/gadget: a brand new digital camera.  After holding back 4 years, I finally decided to give in and buy myself a piece of the new digital photography era: an  urlLink Olympus C 765  4 megapixel, 10x zoom camera. I was looking for the right balance between options and usability, meaning I want to be able to take the no-brainer snapshots, but also be able to control everything. I looked at some ultra-compact camera's too, like the Pentax Optio S4i and the Sony Cybershot DSC T-1 and the Canon Ixus 430 and 500.  See, my problem is that I used to my Olympus OM-2N SLR and I did my own developing and printing for a while. But going on a vacation and taking all that equipment with me, just wasn't practical. And ever since I saw the first digital camera's and how easy it is to digitally retouch your photo's, I knew that one day I would have to go digital too.  So I was looking for a good compromise between options and ease of use and stumbled onto this Olympus (which I think is funny, cause a few years ago I considered them to have lost the digital race).  Update: while I was writing this the postman rang twcie and delivered the little box! Time to unpack my present ;-) In a few hours I will update my blog again....  In the words of Ren & Stimpy: Happy, happy, joy, joy. Happy, happy, joy, joy.

      Well, I guess I should not try to make any predictions anymore. The winner of the EU Soccer Cup is..... Greece! I would have bet on the Tjechs to win, but I would have lost (Portugal beat the Tjechs). The amazing thing is that Greece is like a soccer lilliputter. They never ever got into any final and never ever won a tournament before. They were always the first country to get out of the tournament, but somehow they stumbled through this EU cup. And now they beat the Portugese 1-0. Just one lucky moment to decide a match.  The Greek are really going out of their mind now and parties are all over the place (in Greece that is). And I just read that some Greek guy who lives in England won 400.000 Euro's by betting on the Greek. They were 80-1 when they started the tournament and this guy must have had psychic powers or something to pick the most unlikely winner of all!  There is no second place, winner takes it all.

      Only 8 more days, then I'm on the plane to visit my honey ;-) Two weeks vacation to try and forget all the stuff going on at my work. Last summer Carrie (thats her name) visited Europe and we went to go see Paris. This year we will go on a (short) trip to New Orleans. I am very much looking forward to this.  A lot of fun goes into looking for information on this nice town. Well, I did find a nice website (albeit a bit shallow) called: urlLink Things to do in New Orleans . Carrie lives in Florida, Tallahassee to be exact, and thats a pretty nice town too. I love the old buildings there and the scenery. This year I will make sure that I take enough photos for my website.  The first time we met we went on a trip to Pensacola beach and I think that the buildings and architecture I saw there will be pretty much the same as in New Orleans. Oh well, guess I have to go see for myself ;-)

      What nobody expected, happened. The Greek beat the Tsjechs and will face the Portugese this weekend in the 2004 European Soccer cup finals. Its amazing because the Tjechs so far had won every game and the Greek never ever before even got into the quater finals, let alone the semi finals!  Its going to be an interesting match for sure: the Greek who have nothing to loose and the Portugese that are organizing the tournament and are playing for their own countrymen.  I don't dare to do any predictions for this match... We'll just have to see

      Yes! It's FRIDAY again. Thank God, another work week is over! The fact that it's friday always is good for lifting spirits at my work. Also, since it's vacation time everyone is either  gone or about to go (the running gag when people come to our department is: "Look here, this is our tech-department. Currently everyone is on a sabattical") it's a bit more relaxed here than usual.  We have had two tropical weeks so far, with temperatures in the 28-34 centigrade ranges (82-93 degrees) and this weekend will probably be like that as well. At my home its about 27/80 degrees. Enough to make me sweat when I wiggle my big toe. Funny thing is that last year around the same time, we had a heatwave as well accross Europe. That was the year that Carrie and I were in Paris. A lot of older people in France died that year.  Given the fact that we are all talking about global warming I find it strange that so few European households have airconditioning in their homes. Especialy the old folks homes. In the US you find an airco in almost every home. So if the whole theory about global warming is true (which I doubt, but I'll provide a link on this subject later), chances are we will have some more heatwaves in the near future. And if that is true, why not install more airco's?  I, for one, am very happy with the airco in my car. Really: I get in the car with the same big smile as I get out.  Oh well, enough about the heat. It's friday and I will talk to my sweety again tonight. Another highlight of the day. So all in all its gonna be a good start of the weekend.  Cheerio!  ps: I keep getting questions from people what a Blog is. Well, to be short, its a abbreviation for WeB LOG. I consider it to be more of a online diary, but as I mentioned in a previous blog, in my opinion it originated from people using a .plan file.
