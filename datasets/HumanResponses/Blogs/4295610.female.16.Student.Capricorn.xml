        wow! today was really shitty! i was having a regular day. go to work & pick up my check. go to the bank. cash my check. yada yada! drop my sister off with my mom. Then me and Kelcie were on our way to the mall to do some "back-to-school" shopping. and we ended up getting into this huge accident. and now my car is so fucked up! the front end is all smashed in. honestly, i have to admit...i think the accident was my fault. me and Kelcie were listening to our music and driving. there was a HUGE ass line at the stop light. the line of cars was moving but not that fast. the car in front moved forward. but i waited a minute or 2 so i could move up furture. the line kept moving and i was a little behind. i pushed on the gas peddle a little bit and i had my foot on the brake. i kept rolling down the street and i wasnt paying attention to the road. i was looking at Kelcie who was sitting in the passenger seat. then! Kelcie screamed for me to brake. i immideatly stepped on the brakes &amp; we were both hoping that it was going to be one of those "in the nic-of-time" sort of things. but it wasnt. it was to late. i had hit the car in front of me. the front end of my car is all smashed in. it is totally fucked up! i was also rear ended a little bit. but no damage was really done to the back of the car. i got so freaked out i started crying. the lady in the van that "i" rear-ended was very nice. she was thankful nobody was hurt and that we were all okay. but, i kind of wish that my dad would be more understanding. when he first showed up the FIRST thing that came out his mouth was -- "How the FUCK can you do this? What the hell were you thinking?" -- it wasnt...are you okay? are you hurt? nothing like that! noooo! i sware to god! i think he cares more about the stupid ass car then he does about me. he tell me he loves me. but, i dont believe him. he is never even home. and when he is i am always gone. meh! oh well. humm...well i have had a really shitty day and i am hella tired. so i'm out!
