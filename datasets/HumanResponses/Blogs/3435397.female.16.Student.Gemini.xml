      Hey Hey Hey! Alright so Last night was our rugby game! WOOT! It was awesome! We did so good it was the best game we have played yet! And it rained the whole time! It was awesome I loved it so much I had a blast playing and taking people out but today I am so freaking sore! Jackie and I were streching today while we were waiting for drivers on our breaks and whatever.  My neck is super sore but hey I should have streched after! Today we had our drivers test I am pretty sure I past but if I didn't have the review I swear I would have failed all because of Jackie! lol jk Hun I wouldn't have! But it was pretty easy. I fell asleep last night studying but meh it was okay today. I didn't want to get up though but I survived!  Shocking today I actually kind of talked to the person who I am not really liking to be around most(he knows who he is) and I didn't hate him as much today as I have been I think the grudge is slowly going away! Now I must eat I am starving but I think I might watch   Love actually   but I am not to sure it didn't look to good last night but I could try to watch it today! Write more in a bit though! Later Gator

      Okay so I just found out the reason why my priest from my church hasn't been there in forever! HE WAS CHARGED!!!! Okay if you don't know what I am talking about I am not sure if I even do well here is a  urlLink link  to that its so weird. The best people in the world could yet be the creepest! Now I called rhiannon and she wasn't home and I was crying because this is the worlds biggest shock hang on I am going to call michelle! Okay...She wasn't home this isn't good! I'll call Ashley! Alrite so Ashley was home and I got it all out I feel better.  It's weird the person who you thought was the greatest ever and gave themselves right to God you would never guess a thing like this! Anyway I have to go my mom and I are going to watch another movie Later Gator!

      Okay, so I noticed some people have problems with the way I type and how horrible my English is.  Well right now I am not doing great in English and I guess you know why because GRAMMAR FUCKING SUCKS ASS!!!!!!!! opps is that caps sorry I don't give a shit! And I used a lot of exclamation marks who cares?! If you really have a big problem with this instead of embarrassing me on my own website tell me in person, msn, or e-mail me! That's why you aren't going to the football game with me! And I don't give a shit about your 'pet peeves' I have enough of my own that I don't have to worry about yours. I don't look at your site you don't look at mine if you have that big of a problem with it! Later Gator  P.S. I asked you once to stop and not to worry abou it politely but after that last comment I am sorry but that just kind of pissed me off and when I get pissed off I am a bitch! Okay my Christian side really didn't show writing this but I feel a lot better!

      Alrite so I will start off with a rose!  Last night was the extra curricular awards banquet and I must say everyone looked amazing! Well all but 3 who were sitting in front of us and didn't even change their clothes from the ones they were wearing that day!  But oh well I'm not their parents so nothing to be worried about!  Later one in the night IMPROVE did a little thing for us and it was great! Right before that my dad left so I decide to just laugh and not care! Which I did!:D And today at school Mrs. Banga apologized for Mr.Puscus not being there and he should have told someone or her so she could have presented it to me and she felt very bad and Mrs.Hrazney shook my hand because no on did last night and we both kind of laughed at how big of jerks teachers really can be!  I had a lot of stuff I really needed to talk about but now I forget:S! That's not good! Oh so today Brett Wylie won Tickets to the first rider game right?! Well he doesn't like the riders so he gave them to me! But one big problem! I don't know who to take with me!!! There is Ashley, Michelle, Megan, Jackie, Taylor, and Neil were all possible choices but one problem Neil will probably think its a date but I know he likes football well I am pretty sure since he wears a football bunny hug or so I think That's what it is because I was talking to Dan and he said something about sundevils I think play football I just know the sweater has a smiley face sunshine one it so I don't know I am guessing its football and he tried out for the team last year but he will probably think its a date when two friends are just going to watch a football game and Then there are the girls and I know if I pick one and not the other they might get mad because they are girls and it always happens I am guilty for that this is so hard to choose!!!!! ARGH!!!! I NEED MORE TICKETS! Hey shawn if you read this do you like football? NOT A DATE! lol Rhiannon I know if you were in Regina and didn't have your own tickets I know I would ask you with out a doubt but now....I don't know what I am going to do:( its like I am picking my soccer team okay whose the best kicker....? whose the best goalie? LIKE I DON'T CARE!!!!! I JUST NEED ONE FRIEND WHO NO ONE WILL GET JEALOUS OF AND THAT LIKES FOOTBALL!!!!! When Jason asked if he could go with me I should have just said yes! I am so stupid! ARGH!  Anywho until I know what else to write about I am out  later gator!

      So...You know how we have been having that crazy rain? Well it decide to be super gay today! And rugby was canceled and well Taylor and I wanted to go home so we were walking to Shawnee and rhiannon and oh it started to sprinkle as we were walking out the door then it started to pour when we got by the church and then it started to hail when we crossed the street right after we passed some other church.  Anywho and then one of us was wearing beige pants and said on no! And we all looked at her and started laughing so hard! I must say that walking in the rain with those guys was a blast and a half! lol Oh! When we all looked at her Shawn didn't because he wasn't allowed we wouldn't let him! lol! It was great fun! I must say that when it rains I will always think of us all trying to be dry!Now that I am done bragging that I spent a awesome night well walk with rhiannon, Taylor, and Shawnee I should get to the part of my day where I really need to bitch! You know what is really stupid is when people that are 15 and have a boyfriend decide that they love their boyfriends and want to marry them! And the worst part is they say it about every guy they meet!  Like I really want a boyfriend but I really don't see my self marrying a guy I met when I was 15 and marry him when I am like 30 are they saying that can see anyone else? It's so stupid! Yah I am going to marry a guy I have know for what like 2 freaking months?! Wow I hope you have a loving future together! Better yet send me a post card from you honey moon when you freaking 18!!!! I think I maybe just jealous or something.  I JUST DON'T KNOW!!!! It all started with one stupid guy who was far from even getting a chance to date at all! Tonight I spent with Rhodes, and Shawn and Rhiannon and well lets just say it was a grand party! lol first the rain then the pissing off Spencer "You can't type!" - Taylor  "I can to type!" - Shawn *Shawn typing* "don't worry type" LOL! The funniest thing ever!!! My abs are perfect now! lol good times pissing off Spencer:D lol!  I must say I hardly spend time with Shawn but I really should spend more with him as if ummm lets seee.....2 1/.2 hours with him in one day defiantly isn't enough!  So as if rhiannon and I should spend anymore time together we go bottle/can collecting in the well rich end of the city up in the north lol and we go into this very familiar bay...hmmmm;) But the familiar thing didn't come running down the stairs ripping open the door and say "hi;)" lol and the thing wasn't as hot as we remembered....Maybe because it was a woman.....hmmm:P lol it was an awesome night I must say my friends and I have way to much fun! OH and rhiannon and I got at least a good 15 beer boxes from ONE house lol it was great then the another gave us $5 because she couldn't get to her bottles so rhiannon and I went for ice cream....mmmmmm to Planet Ice Cream....mmmmm.  Anyways I am out  later Gator!

           Okay so I have had a pretty busy life lately and I really want to write again today since it was like my first non-busy day for a while!:D       Lately my life has been full of traveling.....From Vancouver, to Calgary and Banff(good trip but like Rhiannon said very very emotional)  And it started a trend....Things aren't going so great anymore:(*tear*) Anywho, My friends who have been there through everything thanks a bunch because right now is a time of need and you guys are there:D.  I love how when life just gets going great you are getting over the fact that you have lost almost 6 people in under 2 years and then no one dies or disappears for so long like I don't know almost a year I think.  Then a good friend of yours his grandma dies when you are away on a trip and you come back to find out your great aunt who you JUST VISITED over Easter who was perfectly fine happy and loving like all aunts now she probably couldn't tell you from a pet dog who has died.  One more person gone and I loved her so much.  I didn't really know her but I still love her so much!  My cousins Jessica and Teresa I know you guys probably wont see this but just to let you guys know I love you so much and if my mom would let me come with her to visit you I would be there and I would help you get through this because my grandma was like this too and I know the feeling and I really really miss you guys! I love you so much and never for get it!     Okay so I should stop before I have people feeling sorry for me PLEASE DON'T!!!! This is my way of getting everything out and I don't want any I feel sorry for you comments its not me so please please don't! alrite?!      Hey you guys who got positions on SRC I love ya and good job.  For my friend who didn't no matter what I still love you! You're just to good for them lol!  Rhiannon I have a few good ideas too...We have to talk!;)      I have become a book worm thanks to RHIANNON WARD!!!! GRRRR You lol jk.  I have liked those books but when you read 3 in one week there is something wrong with you.  Lol! I am not buying any for a while...I need my money for stuff for the summer and if I spend it all now....I might be in trouble:S lol anywho! I am out I need to shower and I have to be in bed;);) by 10....Parents lol  Later Gator

      MOST BORING MAY LONG EVER!!!! OH YEA!!!!! This is the best weekend ever I swear!;) LOL it sucks asssssssssssssss! So I just went to a movie with my bitch little sister and my mom who doesn't love their mom? She paid so it was good! Anyway I saw  The Prince and Me   it was pretty good I guess right.  Well let me change that it was very good but very fairy taleish:S. You meet the ever so very very freakin hot guy and then you find out he is prince he asks you to marry him you say yes blah blah blah then you leave him and he comes and finds you. you know the rest! So you see if all relationships were like that it would be oh so very realistic....Maybe I am just jealousy that I cant have a decent guy....*sigh*.  I will stop felling sorry for my self I guess. For all you non-single friends of mine(MEGAN!!!!) Hold on to those hot guys of yours because if you let them go they might come back from their palace or not and just say fuck her! Any Hot French chick would like a piece of this......NOT!!!! Anyway sorry I am kind of in a bitch/hyper/crazy/I don't know kind of mood today.   WEIRD!!!!!  So......I bought a new swimsuit today...Another one appropriate for camp! YES!!!! I started this thing that for every pair of shoes I own I need at least one swimsuit.......at least I don't have as many shoes as Josh(sorry dude). OH!!!! Here is the song that Neil gave me the other day:D One Sweet Day By: Mariah Carey Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say And now it's too late to hold you 'Cause you've flown away So far away  Never had I imagined Living without your smile Feeling and knowing you hear me It keeps me alive Alive  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Darling, I never showed you Assumed you'd always be there I took your presence for granted But I always cared And I miss the love we shared  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Although the sun will never shine the same I'll always look to a brighter day Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep You will always listen as I pray  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say  It's A very very good song I can tell you that much! Anywho I am out I have freakin homework like no other and I have to clean my room which looks like my suitcase exploded after Calgary and Banff Later Gator!

To start toned I just hung out with family lets just say this was the WORST MAY LONG OF MY LIFE!!!!! I got to see my uncle tho.  But then I found out his girlfriend who he has been dating I don't know forever off and on and has been living with him hasn't slept in the same bed as him since there were here last like 3 months ago.  So my question for her is what made her decide that this amazing guy deserves to be treated like shit.  Thanks uncle for coming to visit us it was great! That stupid bitch needs to watch her back because the Pastl's can be nice one min and the next she wont know what hit her! TREAT YOU BOYFRIENDS HOW YOU THINK HIS SISTERS WILL TREAT YOU!!!! GRRR! As well tonight I went to my aunts who I thought was the most controlling person ever and she really isn't that bad!:D it was fun!

      Hey!  The car wash was great I got soaked from head to toe but it was super super fun! I had soap in my hair, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, under my arm pits. IT WAS EVERY WHERE! It was still super fun.  For some odd reason josh was there but he was fun to hang out with and marlin and robin! It was a good time! Tonight I watched the Hockey game and clearly Calgary should have won.  That goal people said was in I think that he kicked it in sorry guys but that's what it looked like and it wasn't touching the ground so it wasn't a goal.  Tonight I made a bracelet that Ashley taught me to make on our trip to Calgary and Bambi it was fun!!! It took me forever to make that bracelet but it was tons and tons of fun!   I think you guys might think I am crazy wrighting a Blog every single chance i get but the thing is I am not going to be here all summer and it will be really hard to write when I am not here:( don't worry though I will try as hard as possible to write one every chance to let my friends know how I am doing and that I am going to miss them very very very much! I love you guys a lot and there are only so many days till I am gone! Promise me one thing guys you will have so much fun!!! You will party hard and have an amazing time! I love you all!!! *MUAH*  Later Gator

      So today was Friday and what a good day I must say! LOL It was very slack and kind of upsetting at points but very very slack! I did nothing all day went for lunch with Rhiannon and Ashley because my dad didn't make lunches last night so we went for lunch with my dads money and then we came back to the school and sat out side in the nice nice sun! It was awesome!!! I noticed that tease and Josh were together. Does Josh know yet? hmmmm awe it was so cute!  Anyway I went home after having a slack filled day and sun tanned while make posters and then I had a nice cold cold shower which felt nice.  Then I packed for the relay for life what a packing experience I was talking to rhiannon and michelle and packing!!! It was fun!  That night I went and danced my ass off again and we did awesome I must say! We did really really good! Didn't screw up once and the power stayed on the whole time!!!  After my last dance I met Michel and her parents at the front door and went to the Cancer Relay for Life and I must day it was amazing.  We all dressed up like Holy Family's Super hero's and it was awesome! We looked amazing and had a lot of fun!  There was the one thing I must say I loved most we had a flash light well it was Shawn's and it was a lion? I think yea! It was super cool I loved it! Hey Shawnee how much did you pay for it?! And where did you get it?! That would be perfect for camp man!!!:D LOL I am getting super excited anyway I should go to be because I have to do a car wash in I don't know under 12 hours Later Gator!

      Hey! Okay so all day today I danced and danced well only for 2 hours but still that's long! LOL and it was fun! And then tonight is the recital and my mom had to go to Vancouver so my Little sister and DAD did my hair okay! That's a little wired! But we had tons of fun getting me ready! LOL that night was fun! My friends and I hung out for one of the last times we went out side and watched the hockey game on a hand held TV!!! YAH! LOL it was a good game and brought a lot of excitement to us! LOL we had a blast that night.   We just got off stage on Thursday night and we were in our room talking when all of a sudden there was a bang and the lights went out all we could hear was screaming little kids and then after 5 min the emergency lights kicked in.  It was really scary.  So after about 1 hour and 45 min of talking to my aunt and uncle, watching skater guys and ect. They eventually decide to cancel the recital because the lights never came back on.  I am super tired so  Later Gator!

      I am so pissed off! First my Aunt dies and my parents wont let me go to the funeral and I found a way I could help my aunt and let her know how much I love her and I am going to miss her and my fucking parents wont let me do it! You know because I was "bitchy" on Sunday when I got home from Ashley's when I all I wanted was to hear the answering machine! I am so upset! Why can't I help! Do parents not understand the feeling of wanting to help people?! I hate them so much some times! I know I love them deep down but its so deep down I don't know if I can find love for them now! My mom leaves tomorrow till Sunday for the funeral I think its going to be a living hell while she is gone my dad and I really don't get a long and after this decision I really don't see us getting along any more!  Why is he being so gay! I had to miss my uncle Jackie funeral last year because of all and now I have to miss my Aunt's funeral because my family is fucking gay! I wanted to have fun on Friday night instead of dancing comming home and wishing I was dead! I would have been with the worlds greatest people ever and now I don't get to even walk one lap at all because my Dad is gay!!!! Later Gator

      One day someone was saying to Rhiannon how bad things happen in 3's well whoever that was is right! First Lisa's grandpa died, then Devins grandma and now my great aunt who was basically my grandma since she died.  Things are very stressful right now I can't go to the funeral I have to stay home because of dance and choir so my contribute to cancer is to do the relay for life.  If anyone wants to sponsor me that would be GREAT! It just hit me now that I am NEVER going to see her again and she meant so much to me and for some reason when my mom told me today I didn't cry when I told rhiannon or michelle I didn't cry when I told my sister and she was freaking out I didn't cry at all! But now I can't stop I don't know what it is maybe it is that I have to make stupid cookies and go to dance and miss two days of school but god why does this have to keep happening?! I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me but I need to stop crying somehow and this is the best way to do it is to let it all out on the internet for the world to see.  I just want people to stop dying I want cancer to go away and never come back and I don't know but today at a meeting we were talking about people who have died and I didn't even start crying then! Like I just don't know what it is!  I don't want to anything anymore I just want to sit on my couch and watch TV. I don't want to go to dance tonight or make cookies! I HATE BAKING!!! Oh well live will go on I feel a bit better Later gator!

      You know why mud is so fun to play in? Well I am just guessing here but I think its because we all love to make our parents mad so the easiest way to do it is to play in the mud! And without the mud what would we do?! With all this rain we can play in the mud all day and night! It's so fun! Right! Well mud mud the magical stuff the more we play the more...I don't know you finish the rest alright?! That's your job for this comment! I just wish that It would stop raining so that we could play rugby or something! It would be super fun! I am kind of mad right now so I am going to go later gator!

      Hey! Alright so this weekend was way better then last by far! Friday night was a nice night at home relaxing after a very exciting rugby game and then Saturday I hung out went to drivers came home and did papers then I went to Ashley's place we hung out there with Amber, Travis, Justin, Bunny, and I.  It was super fun we played with the kitties we jumped on the trampoline that was fun! We even named the kitties! The fuzzy one is Lily the one with its eyes close together is Shania and the Black one is Electrode? I think and it means Amber lol! I wanted one so bad but my mom wont let us get one even if I take care of it and pay for everything I want Lily or Shania I love the color of them! My famiky just doesn't like cats I guess THING TO REMEMBER!!!!  Never ask Amber if she is in gymnastics when she is jumping because then she falls through the springs! lol!  We watched   Texas Chainsaw massacre  . What a movie! lol it was good but very scary its not something you can watch more then once because then you know everything that's going to happen.  I kept trying to tell myself that the movie wasn't real I was so fucking scared but then its based on a true story that has never been solved so it wasn't working that well! Ash and I found out 10:30 on sat how good Pina - Coloda smells! It smells like coconut and EVERYTHING that smells like coconut smells so good! And tastes so good well not really but I don't know lol! Anyways! Then Ash and I stayed up way to late and slept till 12 and we had to eat and shower and get ready SUPER fast! lol.  It was a night to remember! Then we picked up my little sister for the Rider game and she brought a friend HER FIRST GAME AND THE RIDERS WON!!! lol it wasn't that great of a game but it was still fun! I saw Mike Switika(??) there and we were looking for Jason Weist but couldn't find him but then I later found out that he was sitting 4 rows infront of us LAUGHING because we couldn't see him!

      Alright so...... School has been school what else is it? I have a math test tomorrow that I just remember meh! I really don't care anymore! LOL anyways today in math was the funniest thing ever!!! I was at the back of the room looking at my marks when I got pushed my Brendan Hoordichuck.  Then Chris started pushing me not big deal and I was like everything you push me I am going to push Brendan. After a few minutes Brendan didn't even look at me and punched me and hit me right in the boob! I was in so much pain and was laughing so hard my eyes filled up with tears! At first he was laughing because he thought I was Ryan Wild well sorry Brendan he doesn't have bob's! He looked at me after a while and had this shocked look on his face and then just started saying sorry over and over again all class.  Chris was shocked too I think so was I! It was so funny I don't think I laughed so hard in my life!  It was funny! I tried to hit him a few times today but I feel bad hitting people and I am not strong enough! LOL! But I must say I kind enjoyed the hug I got when he was saying sorry! OH! He also said after he thought that he didn't hit Wild because I was to soft! LOL! It was pretty funny!Ashley I got to see his hot tummy and you didn't! LOL SUCKER!!!! Anyway Later Gator

      Hey Guys! Okay so today I am 16 it really doesn't feel that different from 15.  LOL today Ashley was brave and got her ear pierced it was awesome!  And I got mine done too! It didn't hurt at all after it kind stung and was hot but that's it and it only hurts when I touch it so if I don't touch it, it feels like an ear! LOL After that Ashley and I were walking towards the school and there was NEIL! He was taking us to Value Village where he spent a shit load of money and I bought all of two shirts! They were so cool! One said Fat Cat on the sleeve and had paw prints all the way across the front of it and the other said "Lumsdon Duck derby" and it had a duck that was bright colors on it! I had lots of fun today!   My math final was really good.  It wasn't easy but it wasn't hard it was a math test! LOL the best way to explain it! Tonight when Ashley was over we went bike riding/I roller bladed and we got a real work out well I did(stupid freakin hills!)  When we got home Candace(older sister) was here and we talked a bit, took Ashley to her grandparents and then I went to my sister softball game.  Her boyfriend showed up so she hung out with him for a bit.  I don't think he is getting any play the because she was kind of I don't know more buddy buddy with him! BUT MEH! All the better! When I got home from the softball game I thought I should return some of the phone calls I got when Ashley and I were out including my sister-in-law Jody called! So I called her back and I talked to my brother and Jody for a long time! It was really good because I missed them so much and my brother actually told me he loved me and I usually have to say it so he can keep his other brother coolness it was really sweet how he was like "Anyways I hope you had a cool birthday*pauses for a long second* I love you!!"  I was really happy him and I haven't been on the best terms LOL! The best thing is that in sept.  My brother and his family are all commons out to Regina for a week and if I talk my parents into it maybe missing a few days of school may be in order.   I want to thank everyone for wishing me a happy birthday and say sorry for being kind of ITS MY BIRTHDAY SO LET ME HEAR IT!!! Kind of Erin today LOL! Today is My day and My NATIONAL HOLIDAY!!! Love you all very much I hope you had a very good Erin's Birthday as well. Oh yea! And to you people who might be showing up tomorrow I will say sorry in advance if you need to go pee please stay upstairs because my basement is a mess and my room well I don't know where it is anymore!  P.s. This whole it's my birthday so lets hear it! Will be over by Sunday I PROMISE! P.s.s. My birthday was made special by all of you people who love me(I hope) and care for me(I hope!) P.s.s.s. For you people who don't listen! Please no gifts if you are showing up tomorrow I really don't need anything right now! Later Gator!!

      Well I am sure they do but now they don't!  So I am been mixed up with my emotions so much right now its weird! I want to be happy because now Neil cant hook me up with anyone and because its my birthday tomorrow but I am almost sad because the guy Neil wanted to hook me up with is hooked....But why am I sad? Today I saw them together for the first time and I was sad?!?! What the hell is wrong with me?! I don't even like him at all!!!! This is so stupid! And I had a chance to go with Neil to Value Village but I didn't go.....What was I thinking?! ARGH!!!! I feel so bad because I went and told this guy that I didn't know who he likes but I knew right and then I played stupid and he told me he liked me and then I didn't respond to him because I realized how big of a bitch I really am! So Steve I am sorry for last year when I told you to ask Jackie out because I was sure she would say yes but the truth is I just wanted to see you get shut down.  Sorry dude I am a bitch!  Sorry Matt for playing stupid and hurting you once again I am a bitch!   I found out a really good friend of mine well her Grandpa died the other day and I must say I love her a lot and I am so proud of her because she told me that morning and when I hugged her she didn't cry.  She didn't cry at all that day when we talked at lunch she wanted to but she didn't.  She didn't cry the next day when we were talking at lunch but she felt like it.  I think she is very strong.  I know if I found out right before I came to school that my grandpa died I wouldn't have been able to do it.  So Hun I love you so much and I am so proud of you and if you ever need anything these next few days I am so here for you!!! I want to say sorry to Neil for saying no today when he kept asking me to come with him to Value Village but then again he has Jessica to go with him but I am sorry for being a Bitch but icon I would have been horrible company today.  Sorry Hun! Spencer I am not sorry LOL you see you never seem to listen and I feel bad for being a bitch and I am sorry I do bitch at you but sometimes you deserve it.  I think Devon would agree with me on this one I feel bad for Jackie when you push her even if it isn't hard but I am scared that she is going to get hurt she is a lot smaller then you and sometimes guys don't know their own streaking.  So I am sorry for bitching but you need it sometimes.   I don't know who I missed for sorry's but guys I am sorry for a lot of the stuff I have done this past week when I was talking with Jackie and michelle after school yesterday I kind of realized what I was doing and I noticed how big of a bitch I am and when I come back after the summer I am going to be changed.  I am going to try and not be a bitch to any of you guys. I want to say thanks to Michelle, Rhiannon, Ashley, Megan,  and Jackie who have been there to help me realize this and For just being there for me to talk to when I need it.  Thanks so much you guys always make me smile when I am down.  You guys are the best people ever and never forget that without you guys being there I would be nothing right now hell I could be getting high with....never mind but still okay thanks for everything! I don't know what I am going to do about my cell phone.  I have told my mom and she said she will pay for it and stuff but I feel its my own responsibility to fix it.  I broke it and I should fix it but I don't know how to do it with out my dad finding out or how to do it without my mom seeing how big it is.  It really isn't that bad its not like I need a whole new phone or anything but this is just messed up.   I also have to find a way to tell my mom that tomorrow right after school Ashley and I are going to get our ears pierced and I know she will want to kill me but I am paying for it and its my gift to myself so I don't know what to do.  My life is fucked up right now my emotions are messed and well maybe I am like a Black Jelly Bean with no emotions? Later Gator

      Okay so today I find out two people who I don't really know have a crush on me....Its okay kind of nerve racking though.  I am scared I have never had two guys like me at once...That I have known of! One of them I know I would NEVER date but still I thought we were friends! Well maybe both of them I would never date but I don't know! I kind of just want to have a guy friend I can talk to about everything and not worry about them thinking that they never have a chance or they are jealous of some other guys.  I had a jealous boyfriend once and it sucked because he hated my best guy friend!!! I really don't know what to do about all of this.  Why are crushes or boyfriends or whatever so hard to understand or  talk to! It's like now that I know they like me its like they don't want to talk to me or something! Its so weird! I am so not ready to grow up.  I think I am going to stick with being just friends with all the guys I know so that this doesn't screw up anymore friendships. I also found out the other day that my BEST GUY FRIEND woulnd't mind being more then friends.  Now what do you do about that? I am spending the rest of my summer with him and I have kind of had feelings for him since I met him two years ago but this is so hard! I never know what to do about guys! Mostly this one because we both said that we didn't want to be more because we were scared that we would hurt our friendship.  I have so many mixed emotions about guys right now I don't know what to do or say........I really hate this!!! Crushes SUCK ASS!!!!! They screw up everything!!!  I also talked to a really good friend of mine from the 3rd grade today! Man did I miss her! Holy I talked to her and her family and her have changed so much! I even invited her to my 16th birthday only 3 days away!!:D Michelle I am so excited for you to come! Your birthday is tomorrow so this should be great!!  Later Gator.

      Hello folks!  This is your friendly neighbourhood guest writer speaking with a message from your captain Erin Wetherill.  As you all know (probably) Erin left today for Camp Monahan and will certainly not be back to post for a long time.  Her last wish (before she left that is) was for me, Rhiannon, to post one last little message.  Here goes nothing!   Taylor Rhodes : thanks for  everything!  =)  Jackie Myers : You're my smile when I'm down.  Ashley Wirtz : You have always been there.  Megan Jack!:  (your new nickname) My farie! or how do you spell it? That's WRONG!! (we looked in the book!)  Jessica Dieter : Say cheese!!  Michelle Antonio : Don't dye your hair without me and towels!  Christine Goetz : Who is going to be my beautiful while I'm gone? or yours?  Regan and Rory Filyk, Nick Faye, and Braden Karchewski : I love you guys like a fat kid loves cake (only chocolate)  Chris Brown : Because of your piece of string I will never lose my ankle!  Conrad Ford : I am so going to buy a Ford truck when I am 25 and name it Conno and it will be my Conno!  Devin Pacholik : I never knew how big of a sap you really are! I love you!  Spencer Miliokas : please keep Jackie in one piece so I can see her when I come home.  I will really really really really miss  Mike Switka !  He means the world to me, and I am so happy I met him!  Mike I love you and can't wait to talk to you!  Thanks guys for always being there.  Without you, I wouldn't be able to live!  You mean the world to me!  That's all folks!

      Alright so today is my last post from now till Whenever I get a chance to write one! LOL I am starting it at 4:26 and I will write a lot! LOL I am really going to miss most of my friends! I am kind of glad to go because now I will notice the things I hate about some of them is really what I love! I need my space and well I will get it for sure! I am going to miss everyone a lot but hey I will be back on weekends to see you hopefully.  I think I made my decision to not go to YLC and to wait till next year I think that's my idea because this year its my first time on staff, Jackie wants to come out that weekend, its the "X" and my cousin is coming out for his first time and I don't want to break a promise! Alright! So I just wanted to let you all know that ahead of time.   So! Tonight Neil brought by a kitty that we are taking out to camp tomorrow she is so cute her name is Pumpkin and I love her and she is my baby!!! LOL we spent tonight with Taylor and Megan.  We had tons of fun! Taylor put corn rows in my hair which I love! And I look sexy! LOL eh Tay! I have my last final tomorrow and Neil is giving me a ride home to get the kitty after school so Marilyn and I can head out right after school.  So I will be saying all my good-byes at break! Don't worry guys if I don't go to YLC I will be in Regina ONE night a week!:D or in the Fort LOL.  I will miss wrighting and talking to all of you and don't be afraid to leave a comment! LOL talk to you all laters and have wonderful summers.  Later Gator for a while! Erin Wetherill

      This is so hard I can't even write right now. I want to go to YLC camp but there is a problem....The problem is my cousin is coming out to monahan the same week and I promised him I would be there.  Jackie and Ashley also want to come out that week too.  And its the same week as the "X" and right now I don't think I could be out at camp with one person.  So I am really not sure what to do because I want to be there sooooooo bad! I want to meet people and all I hear is good things about it! I also lose nights off during the week and I am thinking about just not going to ACYC or Celebrate anymore.  Maybe I am to old or maybe it just isn't my thing anymore.  Something is bothering me and I am not sure what it is anymore.  I want to blame it on everyone else but its no ones fault no ones but my own.  I just think that some people think they are better then me because I don't get straight A's and I don't do everything with my church and I stopped going to church all together. But wouldn't you when you found out that your priest was charged? I am so scared to go back in that church I was there Thursday night for the first time in 6 weeks.  This whole experience has turned me away from church I still have a strong faith in god but I can't be at any churches anymore.  I mean Breanna Anderson was the liturgical Director this year and she didn't go to ACYC, Search, Celebrate, or YLC so do I have too? I don't even know if I want to be liturgical anymore.  When something like this happens to you with your priest wouldn't you be freaked about church and god and everything too? I don't know if I can't get my $150 back from camp or if Jen found a replacement for the week I wasn't going to be there then I will be at camp but if I can and she hasn't found a replacement I don't think I will be.....Later Gator

So yesterday was fun I spent the whole day at my elementary school watching my sister play softball.  It was so fun! cept I got really bad sun burn on my face, shoulders, neck, and legs.  It was really really nice out to watch softball games!  Then I came home at around 4:00 and I didn't want to shower before a bunch of people came over but I didn't smell to yummy and I had made hamburgers, cakes and Veggies for 2 hours so I thought hell everyone will be coming over in half an hour so why not shower fast! SO I DID!!! And I smelt yummy after!!! LOL it was a nice shower it was cold and nice! I saw Michelle parsons and she doesn't really look different but she does a little she is so pretty!!!!! And she was wearing more expensive clothes then me!! So she has changed and I loved seeing her.  Unfortunately she had a really bad head ache and wanted to leave early but as she was leaving Mike showed up! I saw him from the kitchen trough the front door so I bolted around the house and ran outside down the driveway and jumped on him! Thank god I didn't kill him or make him fall because it would have hurt! LOL!  So I said goodbye to michelle and then I went back to where everyone was and after about 20min they all wanted to open presents.  I am going to tell you what everyone got me and who was all there.

      Alright so here it is my summer so far.&nbsp; I met this guy who changed me a lot my opinion of life and how I live it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He changed my attitude and a lot more of me.&nbsp; I have changed a lot and I feel like a better person a way better one because of him.&nbsp; His name is Scott and he is old.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; just kidding he isn't that old he is 21.&nbsp; I am told by others he is a jerk, Ashley, and I could do better.&nbsp; But those people don't know him like I do and I don't know him like they do.&nbsp; I know he can be an ass but hey I will make an ass out of myself when I get hurt right? right.&nbsp;  Life at camp isn't reality.&nbsp; It's nothing like reality.&nbsp; I have been in two programs. Cannoeing and Arts and Crafts.&nbsp; I have had kids as well for 2 weeks.&nbsp; Swim camp and Scampers who I loved a lot!  I have been very busy I was home last weekend and I am home this weekend but for all my other weekends the first one I went to Michelle's(a girl from camps) and I got very drunk and there was a little 90210 going on but hey that got fixed.&nbsp; The weekend after I went to Cupar for a Cupar Gopher Drop.&nbsp; Lisa and I got into the drinking side even though we are under age and once again got really drunk.&nbsp; So I took a break and next weekend I am going to the "X" with a bunch of camp people then MAYBE Michelle's cabin for her birthday.  OH YEA!!! MARK IS 18!!!!! YAY!!!!!  I have made a lot of new friends out at camp they are amazing people I love them so much! We have had the best time and I have gotten really close with them.  But most of all I really miss all of you guys! It's super hard being out there.&nbsp; I don't have any of my best friends to talk about things like the age difference and how bad it is or how people out there are getting on my nerves.&nbsp; But I must say I and all the Lakeshore guys(who are going to Edmonton assholes!) and Jessica deserve this 3 day weekend! WE NEED IT!!!!!  Yay for counting down the hours with Tj. And going crazy with Mark.&nbsp; Jen and Matt never put us three together for program groups ever again.&nbsp; We are HORRIBLE PEOPLE!!!!! LOL.  Thanks Barb, Tj, Kate, and Mark for an awesome 3 days. Thanks Lakeshore for the great experience I never knew how freaking crazy Tj really is LOL!  Anyways I need a lot of sleep and I have a lot to do in 3 days so Later Gator!!!!
