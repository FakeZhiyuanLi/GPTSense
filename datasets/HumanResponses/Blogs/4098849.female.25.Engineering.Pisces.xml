Have you ever asked your self -- "is there someone truly right for me out there?,  a soul mate, and if so, why should I assume that I'm going to find that person right here, conveniently living in my city?"  Well, this is a beautiful story about a beautiful new way of falling in love and the best part is, this story is true.
  
Chapter 1
 
Strangers in cyberspace
 
 
Yes it happened to me in the spring of 2000. I fell in love, true butterflies in my stomach, shaky legs, sweaty palms love. And I found my love in the most unexpected place, in cyberspace!  It was a friday night, I had stayed late at the university, I was in the office where I was doing my social service after classes, trying to finish some homework, it was after 9:00 pm. so I called my dad to come pick me up, I didn't have a car at the time. I put my books away and I was about to turn off the computer but instead I decided to jump to some other web site looking for distraction, I went to this philosophy chat room but I can't even recall which chat room or how I got there in the first place. There were only 5 people in the chat room including me and the atmosphere of the conversation that was taking place was very heavy and boring so I decided to start a conversation of my own with "Anaximenes" and that's where it all started. Today I don't even remember what we talked about but it wasn't anything important or personal cause I only stayed online for about fifteen minutes. For some reason I gave this mysterious character my e-mail address (not that I advise anyone to do so, you know you have to be careful online kids) anyway I didn't see any harm in it at the time and it was difficult for him to get any personal data from my e-mail so I said what the hell, he's not going to write to me anyway, I'll never hear from this guy again.
  
Funny thing but the very next day I got an e-mail from "Anaximenes". I really think this was the moment when I fell in love even if I didn't know it at the time. It was like love at first sight or in this case, love at first e-mail. There were many things about his letter that attracted my attention, his style of writing was so correct and straight to the point, he seemed sincere from the start. The way he introduced him self and gave me the short version of who he was trilled me because we had so much in common. Because of this I decided to write back and in a similar matter I said hello and told him a little bit about my self. 
  
After that first e-mail a friendship began between us, we would talk about our careers most of all, he would help me with my computer classes homework, recommending books and helpful web sites. I also enjoyed talking to him about philosophy, politics and science. He became my first and only e-mail buddy. 
Very soon we started talking more about our lives and about our selves. 
   
At the time we were both in a relationship mine ended in february of 2000, his was a long distance relationship, it came to an end when he realized that we had fallen in love. By that time we would meet in the chat room almost every day. One day I realized that I just couldn't get this guy out of my head, I would think of him, at least twenty times a day and would rush to school just to check my e-mail, waiting anxious to find an e-mail from him. 
I realized then that I had fallen in love with my computer and that this love was more real than any love I had found in the flesh. 
  
The day we decided to start this crazy adventure of love, started out like any other day. We met in the chat room at the stipulated time but this time there was an uncontrollable urge to tell him how I felt and been feeling about him for a long time, crazy as it was I was in love! So that day I told him how I felt and I found relief in knowing that he felt the same way. The truth was that we fell in love with each others dream, which in fact turned out to be the same dream. 
  
I fell in love with his words that reflected his thoughts and the person he really is. Funny thing about the internet it's as easy to tell the truth about your self as it is to lie, you just have to choose the way your going to go, if you go with the truth the result is strong relationships that are as real as having the person right next to you.

        I am a Mother.  

I am a mother! 
Whether I have one child or many,  I am a mother. 
Whether my children are grown or infants, living or dead,  I am a mother. 
Whether through birth or c-section, surrogacy or adoption,  I am a mother. 
 
Nature is energized with the power of Mother Love. 
Every time I comfort a crying child, 
Kiss a boo-boo, 
Brush away tears, 
Tell my child 
Yes you can 
I believe in you 
You are strong 
You are special 
You are loved, 
Every time I 
Soothe a crying infant, 
Comfort a frightened toddler, 
Soothe a nervous child, 
Listen to an unhappy teen, 
I am sending that energy out through the universe. 
 
Every time I hug instead of hit, 
Speak gently when I want to yell, 
Give up my sleep, my peace, and sometimes my sanity, 
And give when I wish I could take, 
I am helping 
The Earth to spin, 
The winds to blow, 
The tides to ebb and flow, 
And the spirit of Hope to beat in the heart of Humanity. 
I am a Mother, 
And I rule the World.

       1. "Geeks have greasy skin and pimples." 
        
      Actually everybody can have oily skin and acne problems not just geeks. Most people think this because geeks are less interested in their appearance than other guys and they don't care about a few pimples.
  
2. "Geeks are boring"
  
     Geeks are about the most interesting people because they are well read and they study just about anything. They always have something to talk about if you give them the chance. The only thing is that most geeks are so involved in their studies and projects that they have very little social contact, because of this they appear shy and they don't know how to act in social gatherings. Best thing is to talk to them one on one rather than in group.
  
3. "Geeks are bad in the sack cause they never get laid"
  
     This one is the most horrible of all myths, it gives geeks a bad name and it's totally untrue! And this I can and have verified my self (you know me being married to a geek and all...) So listen up ladies, geeks are great in bed! They are the perfect lover because they know their body very well, they have seen a lot of porn, they are willing to try just about anything that you want and they really listen. If you talk to your geek about what you like he'll master the technique fast. 
Another very important thing they don't try to satisfy them selves first, they give you your money's worth! They have a lot of self control and only let go when they are sure that you are satisfied.
  
4. "Geeks are weak and everybody pushes them around"
  
     Yeah well maybe in high school because in the real world (where it matters) they always come up on top. Geeks have all the knowledge in their field, science is in their blood. Let's face it knowledge is power and that is what geeks have, not to mention the money that follows.
  
5. "All geeks think about is computers"
  
     Not true, when they are not thinking about computers they think about sex. Oh and Star Wars lol.
  
Geeks Rule!
