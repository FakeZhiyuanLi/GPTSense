      Yeah I've been super busy with exams and such but school is over now so enough talk of that. I have blue hair now and it's fantasmic. It is the coolest thing I've done involving hair. Hmm let's see what else. Oh yeah, I got Modest Mouse's Good News For People Who Love Bad News. It is a great CD. The moods it gos through is awesome. You've prolbably heard Float On if you listen to some indie radio stations. This os one album that should be taken as whole instead of song by song. It is fantastic. Tomorrow I'm gonna chillax with some buddies. Hehe I watched Bubba Ho-tep yet again. I'm off now. -Satisfied Gavin You have a boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year.

      God I love Bubba Ho-tep. I fell asleep watching it last night. Today I'm feeling loads better. Literally it was measured and it came out to a load. So nothing good happened at the mall. My item I was questing after was unavailable. I met by friends sister who works there. Other than that no revelations occured. However I hate the transit system for West Vancouver...because it sucks my ass. I waited for 40 minutes, which is actually short from past experiences, for a bus way behind schedule. Oooh and I had sushi for dinner. BC rolls rock. If they played guitar they would bust out some Page inspired solos. Mmmm BC rolls. So there's my insane diary. -Hip-happening Gavin I could have lied I'm such a fool.

      Ooooh wa ah ah ah.  My flu-ish feelings of the past few days have culminated into a sickness and let me tell you its not so great. However to comfort me Bubba Ho-tep arrived today so I'm gonna take some joy in watching that tonight. Oh and I set up a Gmail account with much thanks to my sister for hooking me up. Kids on the streets today would be like "Yo funkdaddy. Thanks fo' that ghetto fresh smack. Werd." 1 gigabyte of free storage. It's lovely. So not much to talk about here today. I may pop down to the mall tomorrow. If I'm up to it. So uneventful is todays special word. Uneventful...AAAAAAH!...Yes I miss Pee Wee Herman's Playhouse. -Under The Weather Gavin There are no monks in this band.

      Well for the most part it was. I started the day feeling a tad sick, but for the most part I got over that. I just hope tomorrow I don't feel like this. So yeah one of my best friends is getting jaw surgery(bad) but gets to skip exams to do so(good). So today we had a little shindig to wish her well. I got my tickle on if I do say so myself. We watched some Samurai Jack cause we're uber-cool. After that I started reading Fight Club because its a kick ass wicked movie and I wanted to see the book it was noveled after. 1 week until I have blue hair. It's gonna rock my socks off. Ooh and Anthony Kiedis is releasing his autobiography soon. That'll be a gem to read. So today had a rocking swing to it. Bye my non-existent as of yet readers. -Happy Gavin

      Ok I'm the advice guru in this love...well it's not a triangle it's a friggin octoquad. There's so many angles here theres no word for it. It's as if no one can just be nice and just honest and open about their feelings. They have to go and say I'm not talkign to her cause she's sort of into someone I never made known I was into but she should have guessed anway. I mean how do you respond to that? Wow your an idiot just talk to them? If only it was that easy. They have to just make me be the messenger. So if anyone out there feels my pain or has been in this situation drop a comment. It'll be kooky fun. -Annoyed Gavin

      I swear today nothing happened. Except I just had a wicked sneeze. I love those things. You just feel refreshed and happy after a really good sneeze. I've been playing guitar and bass for about three hours straight now. I realised how much Queen truly rocks. I mean who really cares Freddy Mercury was gay, he was an amazing singer and a cool dude. So I sort of got kicked out of science but not really and went to the cafeteria and hung out. There's one really annoying kid that was with us but he sucks. I had fun anyway because I ate chips and learned. Its annoying how you know the material but they have to spend about 7 classes going over it and giving you assignments that just waste your time. What's the deal. Ooh I found the most heinous pen in the world. It's about 11  inches in height coloured like an american flag and at the top is lady liberty. It's not a pen it's an eyesore. I also had a talk about my karmic beliefs with two people who could not just go with me and I got highly frustrated. If you read this you two this is me glaring. *evil eyes* Yeah so that's my day in a nutshell. Fairly uneventful yet still fairly entertaining. -Gavin I made a cool song about a blueberry muffin. Totally sexy and svelte.

      I had much caffeine and not much of sleep. So combine those two elements and you get an insane lunatic that replaces the mild mannered student regularly seen. I call him g-squared. I don't know why. So exams are coming up and I'm gonna feel the stress soon. At the moment I currently do not care. All I'm doing is waiting for Bubba Ho-tep to finish shipping from Amazon. Yes that's right the kick ass Bruce Campbell vs a mummy movie. In about two weeks my hair will be blue. I'm considering a mini mohawk in Chili Peppers Tribute of course the blue is for Flea. I'm gonna put some crazy pictures of it up when I'm done and have figured out how to do so.  I'm going to go jam up some bass music for now. Toodles -G

      Hello people of the world. This is my message to...you. From this moment on this is my forum for everything wild and crazy in my life. Or it will be lame, either or. So as you can tell I like the RHCP gods of rock!!!!! They are my masters. I play guitar and bass totally in this wicked rockin band. As of yet we are unnamed, but that will change soon! I'm hyper right now. Hmmm, Cheese.  My next posts will be far more structured I just thought I'd scare you all. Boo!!!!!! Ha...hahaha.  Good night all you kung-fu hippies. -Reverend Doctor G-Squeeze PS: I like roller skates. PPS: That's a lie I friggin' hate roller skates.

      Howdy folks, does it sound like I'm on old time radio? I went cliff jumping today. Mmm thats some fun stuff, my buddy sort of sacked himself on the fall tho, so that must have sucked. Last night we had a campfire and some kids came down and we partied. Then some batards had to bring alcohol and cigarettes. So in the end someone's cigs got stolen and they were bitching about it and I knew who did but I had said I wouldn't say. So this chick goes off the deep end at me. I almost smacked, lucky for her I'm too beautiful to attack her myself. It's stupid the way people get over their substances. Above all today I have to do her a favour and return the crap she left at the fire. I should just toss it in the lake and forget about it but I'm too damn courteous. Other than this incident the summer has been kick ass. I got my hands back on a bass so I'm enjoying it. See you all at a later date. If any of my pals read this I miss you guys like crazy. If any of my enemies are reading this, punch yourself in the sac or the female pain equivalent. -Slightly Frustrated G I went to bed and didn't see why everday turns out to be a little but more like Bukowski.

      That song needed to be alluded to. Yeah going up to the annual event at the Shuswap lake so my blog will go unloved for awhile. Summer isn't goof for this little guy. Yeah, things have been going good for the most part, I'm going to miss my buddies while I'm up there but a few of them will join me. I look forward to wakeboarding and jamming on the guitar and bass stuff. It's gonna be good. I'll make a post about Farenheit 9/11 first chance I get. That is a movie you should go see. If biased and one sided it is still an incredibly powerful movie. -Tired Gavin I've been dying to meet you, there must be a devil between us
