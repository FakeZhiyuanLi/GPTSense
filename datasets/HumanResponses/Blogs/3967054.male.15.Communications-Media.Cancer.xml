      At first, the thought of saying goodbye to the Stanistics was unfathomable. It was at the end of a long tunnel. I pushed it out of my mind, because these were people I have known since birth. I would lay there in my diaper, next to Diana, and Gracie. Awe at the birth or Lauren, and Angélica, and listen to a young Angé tell me how we would marry in a few years. A few years ago, we went to Myrtle Beach with the whole "CW Post Crew" (dubbed this because our parents were all alumni from college). It was a very memorable trip, and we became closer then ever. Now they are moving to North Carolina, and it all seems so sad. Then I realized, I don't know them anymore. I dont KNOW them - who they are, what makes them smile, and what makes them laugh. On the ride up, I blasted Madonna in my ears, as I thought that over; that I would be saying goodbye to people I didn't really know today. Suddenly, as we walked to the restaruent on Mott Street, I realized: I know them, but it is them who don't know me. My sexuality pretty much defines me. And for people who don't know about it, I put some kind of shell in front of me. I never showed them the real me, and I never came out to them. In fear of how they would react, or losing these friends forever, I shut them out. And I inevitably lost them, because THEY lost ME.  Dinner proved to be something I hadn't expected. When I think of HopKee, I think of: dirty Korean waiters, who need to learn how to use deoderant, dirty utensils, cramped and underground hideout, disgusting food, and people who I feel awkward with. I wasn't expecting to have fun, but I did. The food was good: ungchoy, chow fung, and white rice. Hearty Korean cuisine. And I laughed every single minute I spent with the CW Post Crew. I guess I was wrong; we both knew eachother, what makes us laugh, and smile. We discussed the memories we had of Myrtle Beach, and of all of our inside jokes over the years. 15 years of inside jokes, and memories, all summarized and compressed in a few hours. It was quite the farewell.  When we left HopKee, we walked the damp streets of Chinatown. Rain was still washing away the worries of everyone on the street - and we walked over to Little Italy. The streets were closed for a rained-out festival, and the hard rain calmed to a smooth drizzle. We stopped at Ferrara's, an amazing Italian bakery, and I had two scoops of pistachio ice cream, and a fork-full of Gracie's tiramisu. It all went down my throat smoothly. Then we hit the streets of Little Italy and Chinatown. I purchased a Von Dutch visor, which I like very much, and everyone else bought those trendy Chinese chanclas.  On the corner of Worth and Mott Street, the darkness etching shadows on our chiseled faces, and rain mixing in with tears, we said goodbye. A finale that will seem to last forever. But deep within our hearts, we know that distance cannot seperate the souls of the CW Post Clan.

      The situation in Sudan and the surrounding Darfur region makes me want to vomit. It is horrific and disgusting. What is more disgusting is the fact that the international governments are doing nothing. Kofi Annan is begging, and the United States does what? Sends over Colin Powell. That didn't do...well...anything! We can go into Iraq to "liberate their people" and take their oil, but god-forbid, when an actual humanitarian crisis emerges, we do anything to help. For those of you who don't know what is happening, the Arab government hired militias, called Janjaweeds, to go across the country and kill, and torture any members of the african tribes. Rascism between the blacks, and arabs was caused by some economic problems in the 1970s. The actions of the Janjaweed has affected more the 1 million people, and is called the greatest humanitarian crisis to hit Africa. The UN calls it "borderline-genocide". Rwanda II. And yet the international community is doing... the US is doing.... you guessed it - pretty much, nothing. Even though, ten of thousands lay dead, a million fleeing the country, and starvation common among everyone. Africa has become a slaughterhouse. As if the effect of AIDS wasn't bad enough for the region.  I think the most atrocious thing these Janjaweed members are doing, is raping the women and female children. The family values in Sudan state that rape is unforgiveable. And the victims of rape are ostricized by their family, husbands, and friends. As if it was their fault that they were raped!  The United States refuses to give more money to the UN AIDS fund, and will not forget the billions of dollars of debt the african countries find themselves to be in, but cant afford to repay.   But today, I read in the google news that the government of Sudan sentenced 10 members of the janjaweed to amputation of their limbs, and life in jail. Somehow, despite all of the torture they have done, and all of the lives they have taken, feel that they are victims of their government. The government hired them to do this. They told them. The government, in addition to these men, need to pay. And why do they need to lose their limbs? This government is turning away from one atrocious line of events, to yet another. I am not happy yet. I think when it comes to most, if not all, African affairs, I will never be happy with how things are dealt with. An international court needs to step in, and take action. A new government is needed to watch over the country of Sudan, and the biggest economies in the world need to help out a bit. Let's stop building new sports stadiums, and start helping people who need it most.

      Martha Stewart, the queen of perfection, and home accessories, lied to the government about how she sold Imclone. Oh my goodness, she LIED! When she lies, we send her to jail for 5 monthes. But when Bush lies, we send our children to fight a war in Iraq. I think sending Martha to jail is wrong. Jail is supposed to be a place we send people who are a threat to society. If anything, Bush poses much more of threat to the people of this country than Martha does! And why are we spending tax payers' money to keep in her jail? It's a waste of money. If anyone of us found ourselves in the same position she did, we would have done the same thing - sell our shares in order to save our money. Don't deny it - you love money, and we all have friends in benefitial places. Martha was trying to live the American dream, with her money, her success, and her line of products. And now she has found herself a prisoner of politics and the hate of the public. People LOVE to HATE her. She is perfect, she is rich - she is everything we want to be, and because she is caught of this, she needs to be stoned to death! Martha Stewart lied about her shares of Imclone, and she is going to jail. Clinton lied to us about his extramartial affair with Monica Lewinsky, and he was impeached. But when Bush lies to a country, he gets a war. Bush is a murderer, something that is far worse than anything Clinton or Stewart ever did, and he gets no consequences!   But after Martha was sentenced, she compared her jailtime to that of Nelson Mandela's. Mandela was thrown in a South African jail, and beaten everyday for 26 years for conspiring to overthrow the discriminatory Apartheid. Martha is going to jail for lying to the US government about her dealings with her shares of Imclone, and is being sentenced to 5 monthes in a waspy jail. I can totally see the connection, Martha!  *rolls eyes* Look hun, I disagree with the reason you are going to jail, but do not push my limits. Your case has no connection to that of Nelson Mandela - unless your Kmart line is suppoed to liberate the people of a hateful regime. Which I doubt was your plan.  My room is painted in Martha Stewart paint. And I am repainting my room next month. And I think I'm going to buy more of her paint! I have never bought anything else from her line, but now I feel like supporting her! Free Martha!

      I love people who think they can wear spandex, or a bikini, but really should refrain due to their weight. Be proud about your size, but please, do not wear xxsmall spandex pounds. I think it's great you're 300 pounds! - just dont wear a bikini. God had a plan when he created spandex, and those people need to realize that they were not meant to be apart of it. Today at Great Adventures, it was like the monthly meeting of the Overweight Spandex Wearers Association. Painful. And it's not like there was any kind of warning, because you turn around, and BAM - huge woman in a bikini - or 400 pound woman wearing a tube top of the Puertorican flag, shaking her ass for everyone to see. It brings tears to my eyes...  So today was my doctors appointment. Just an annual checkup; so i woke up at 11 am for my 12:30 appointment. Everything went well: I arrived and signed in, and waited awhile until they gave me the little cup to pee in. And I just stared at it, thinking, "SHIT! I don't hafta go right now! This is alot of pressure to put on one person!" But I walked to the bathroom to try anyways. They strategically place the restroom on the other side of the waiting room, so you got to walk that long stretch, and people are looking at you, and then at the cup, and sneering. Like, "Eww, you have to pee in that." But I tried to hold my head up high, and smile at the grimacing faces around me. Once I arrive to to bathroom...I still could not manage to pee. So I waited 'till after my physical - in the end, everything is worked out. I didn't need to get any shots. My blood test (where they prick your finger) didn't hurt as much as I thought it would, and my physical was okay. But it turns out that I have minor scoliosis- something that is common in growing teens. I need to go back in 6 monthes for him to recheck my back. My mom is going to call the orthopedist for an appointment as well.   Afterwards, mom took me and Jenna to Barnes&Noble to get summer reading books: The Red Badge of Courage, The Killer Angels (sparknotes- i refuse to reread it), The Old Man By The Sea, and Stargirl (wasn't on my list, but I never found out how it ended, so I bought it). My boo boo on my finger was biting me, so I bought a cool Caramel Frap at Starbucks, and it suddenly did not bother me at all.  :-D  I came home, and was on the computer for a little while and my uncle knocks on my door. "Wanna go to Great Adventures with us?" YEA, how did you know I was lusting for it last night? Dude, thats awesome! So I went. Viper beat the shit out of my neck, probably not good for my back either. Medusa was fucking awesome, as well as Nitro. On the line for Medusa, the couple in front of us confused me. The guy had a puertorican flag tattoed on his arm with the name 'Latoya: My PR Princess' under it. The girl with him was wearing those huge bling bling earrings with her name in it: Sandra. And she had the name "Linda" tattoed on her neck. Are they having 4-way orgies?! Also, listening to the ghetto people get off of Nitro is fun. "OH MY GAH! Dat waz liike fuckin amazing!" "DA-amn bro'!" "Mah hea' waz liike *makes popping sound*!" We brought Christopher to the Looney Tunes Seaport and he rode rides while we shot water at people on the log flume by Skull Mountain. They have this thing were you pay a quarter, and you can dunk water on unsuspecting riders. It's amazingly fun, and eventually people line up and take turns shooting them - all laughing in unison when the shot hits the bullseye.  The sun set, and we said goodbye to Six Flags at 930. Came home and took a shower. And here I am, ending my eventful day talking to my friends, and blogging.

      The baby blue cover, with the simple etchings of a yellow star, and green female stick figure begged me to read it. Jerry Spinelli's Stargirl. It is such a beautiful story, and I can't wait to finish reading it. If it was a human, it would have silky hair, smooth skin, and tender lips. It would laugh against the thunder of a raging storm. We'd sit in the forest nostalgically, and create memories that would last a lifetime. All written on pages... 75 pages in, so I expect to finish it in about 2 more days. If Stargirl were a human, I would be having an affair with it now, under my sheets.  That's pretty much how I spent my day: reading. I woke up late, which isn't a mere surprise anymore, rather a part of my daily routine. My everything bagel was a nice difference in breakfast, considering I've been eating either Cheerios, or Rice Krispies every day. I emailed Colleen at camp, and told her that Janet Fitch had written a book in 1996, one that we will both need to read simultaneously when she returns. Waiting by a cell phone for Sam to call me about fair plans got blown over in a swift sigh when I decided to rather spend my night reading.   The painful reality of my summer reading has hit me as they lie lifeless on my desk. Eww...civil war novels. Gross. I would much rather engulf myself in the life of Ingrid and Astrid. Or Stargirl. I'm going to procrastinate it a little longer though. At least until I finish Stargirl.   Madonna is serenating me now, while my thoughts drift. Under my sheets: I'm thinking of love, and life, and adventure. Sunsets over wooded lands, or the waters of a peaceful ocean. Of beautiful flowers, and soothing kisses melting in my mouth like Hershey's chocolate. Like a moth to a flame, only I am to blame - you're to have, not to hold. To look, but not to see.

      Just when you thought it was safe to go outside, the media is reporting that Michael Jackson is the father of quadruplets. Jackson denies the claim. But Mike has a niche for lying - "i never had plastic surgery" - "i have a skin condition that is causing my pigmentation to become lighter" - "i did not touch that boy" - "i am not the father of quadruplets". Stop lying! We know you are morphing your body so you can look more like Peter Pan, the nose totally gives you away on that one. And please, pick a race: are you black or white? Do we need an anthropologist to come in and study your bone structure? Oooohhh, riiiight, you didn't touch that boy... you only had sleepovers where you slept in the same bed! It appears that with that record, you are the father of The Jackson 4! The first thing I thought of when I heard this was, "Wait, the brothah has a fucking penis? And it's NOT plastic??" I didn't even know someone who is borderline male-female can produce sperm. Michael Jackson is in a race, and sex, all by him self. He redefines weird. He is a nonconformist who is in his own category. Even Cher cringes at his hairstyle - ouch. Not to mention Marilyn Manson, who sucks his own penis, is saying, "Da-amn Michael, what the fuck is wrong with you?!" People right now are probably praying for those children - and so do I. But I feel worse for the mother. She has his toxic sperm inside of her! His mutant children are growing within her body. How do you heal that mental scar? Which one of the 12 steps is going to ease the pain? How could a woman volunteer her ovaries for the sperm of Michael Jackson? He is unfuckable, and mistreats children. But I guess one day, she'll have a great story for a bar. "You had sex with a gay midget?! Oh yea? Well I banged Michael Jackson!"   Just when you think it can't get ANY weirder with him... it ALWAYS does. What's next: Michael Jackson Inpregnates Self?!

       urlLink  Picture of Queen Elizabeth That I Am Talking About   Fashion reflects what one feels like on the inside. Well, to be frank, Liz looks like she is dying painfully. It's just as simple as that. When people see that picture, the first thing they usually notice is how short she is. Nuh uh, bitch; not me! The first thing I saw was her horrendous shoes. If we can even call them shoes... boots.... clogs.... . They aren't even flattering; they show her disgusting cankles! I don't know what is worse: her patent leather go-go boots, or that dress? *grimaces* Was she trying to hypnotize someone with that dress? You would have thought that someone would have got in her face and told her, "Foo' THERE ARE TOO MANY DOTS ON YO' DRESS!" I love how those pearls match her hair, which looks stale. It looks like a wig - gone ghetto. Pull out the doo-rag, please. You can tell her face has been deprived of makeup, because it lacks all human color whatsoever. This is the perfect example of a person who literally got dressed with her eyes closed, and none of her advisors had the balls to say, "Da-amn, you look fucked up, bitch!"   Queen Elizabeth II has been found guilty of a fashion faux pas, and should stab herself with that sword as a result.

      This is a follow-up to: Don't Go There Martha  After being sentenced to 5 monthes of prison time, and 5 monthes of home confinement for lying about her dealings of Imclone, Martha Stewart told Larry King that she is going to write a book about her trial experience. It will act as a guide for those who are undergoing the same thing. She says is will cover how to choose a lawyer, how to behave, and how to attend an interview. Because we all know that we don't know how to behave in the court room - we're a bunch of barbaric monkeys! Ironic too, how Martha never attended HER interview, but is willing to give tips. I can just imagine an excerpt from the book: Remember ladies, you can't wear a horizontal striped outfit, and make sure your nails are prim and proper. Only a real woman wins her case! *insert corny smile* OR: When baking brownies for the judge, remember to use triple fudge chocolate chips instead of nuts. Nuts upset the mood of the brownie, where as chocolate chips will only enhance it's taste and texture. If your judge is a respectable woman, try making a homemade candle for her. Avacado extract candles are a great choice, because their aroma can enrich any room.  I think it's great though how Stewart is using her jailtime to her advantage. This book will most likely rack in a hefty profit.

      Bush & Kerry are currently tied.       Hmm...well at least Kerry is taking home more of the swing states. You pretty much know my opinion about this election. I am anti-Bush, and a volunteer for the Kerry campaign...who do you think I want to see win? Duh.  The 911 Commission released it's 500+ page report. Available at bookstores for 10 bucks.       I'm hoping my dad will take my to Barnes & Noble so I can purchase it. And read it. I'm kinda skeptical though. They put absolutely no blame on Bush at all. In my opinion, him and his administration deserve some of the blame. All I needed to do was watch the 911 commision interview with Condi Rice to know that. And the August 2nd memo that the president didn't read (he was busy golfing, and vacationing) was definately damning. If you saw the news today, you would see that Bush was very happy to see no blame was put on him. I think this report is more politics than it is truth. Which is sad.  Helicopter crash killed 3 soldiers.       Such a shame. They were probably kids waiting to come back to go to college.  War funding is dwindling.          Poor budgeting, Mr. Bush. Shouldn't have lowered taxes... shouldn't have waged wars. Shoulda coulda woulda...  Forest fires in the west are getting worse.           Uh oh...we seem to be reliving summer 2003.  Dr. Stephen Hawking has changed his black hole theory.        Interesting...i can't wait till he releases his updated edition of his book so I can read it.  Army announces 94 more prisoner abuse allegations.        sigh. not surprising.  Video released from the Pentagon shows the 911 hijackers passing through airport security.        did they have any weapons on them? why weren't they stopped? it doesnt take an idiot to take away a knife from someone who is going to board a plane.  Gotti Jr. was indicted for hiring a hitman.      well, that apple didn't fall far from the tree.  Sudan government tells UK and US NOT to take militairy action within the country.      US and UK should take actions through the UN. although, hearing the Sudan government, the ones who hired the janjaweed, say "back off" kinda makes me skeptical of their interests...

      Margaret Cho has been uninvited to the Unity 2004 Event in Boston, which will be happening around the same time of The Democratic Convention. This uninvitation was sparked because of the media's frenzy over comments said by Whoopi Goldberg. I think people need to understand that as artists, their job is to comment on culture. As a comedian, and a citizen of the United States, Goldberg has the right to say whatever she wants. The Kerry Campaign is distancing themselves from Whoopi, and other questionable comedians, because of critisism from the conservative media, and Republicans. It may be shocking, but comedians are like that at times. Instead, the official kickoff of Cho's "State of Emergency" tour will be at the Apollo on August 28th.   Oh, and by the way, I didn't hear any one cringe at Dennis Miller's gay comments about Kerry and Edwards at a recent Bush rally. The media must be so caught up in its right-wing frenzy, that it ignored it completely. Because God forbid we ever say anything against the beloved ruler of our Theocratic Democracy.

      I just finished Jerry Spinelli's  Stargirl . What a great book! It was so human, so loving, and so moving. Forcing you to reexamine the life you lead, this book contains the power to change lives, and bring peace and love into hungry souls. Starigirl is one of the most human charecters I have ever come across in literature. If you prick this book with a needle, it will not only cry, but it will bleed.   Quotes:  "[Stargirl] is more than we are us."  "That was no saint kissing me."  "When a stargirl cries, she does not shed tears, but light."

      The US Congress has deemed the situation in the Darfur Region as genocide. The Janjaweed continues to burns villages, rape women, and mutilate children. Despite the fact that they Sudanese government has claimed they unarmed them.Tony Blair is drafting plans to send troops to Sudan. The UN has drafted a resolution concerning this situation.  All I have to say is: the UK and US should not go in. Let the UN do its job. In the situation where Sudan defies the UN resolution, I dont know whether I agree with US and UK sending troops over yet.

      As you can see, the look of my blog has changed. Thanks to boredom at 3 am, this is my way to welcome in August. While the layout is the same, the colors, and some of the cool features are new and improved.  Some of the new features include new smileys, like this one:     How awesome is that emoticon? Pretty neat, huh? And this one:      Sah-weet! Another new addition to the blog is the poll you see in the middle of the right tab. (below the WMDs counter, and before the the quotes). The question will change every week? month? i dont really know yet; and will be more exciting than the generic question on it right now. Feel free to suggest poll questions, and obviously, participate in the poll. A new daily humorous cartoon can be viewed by clicking the button in the tab located below the quotes section. And a counter at the very bottom of the right tab will count visitors based on their IP addresses. What do you think of this new design? Tell me by commenting on this post, or posting on the chatterbox. Or IM me.

      I went into the city on Saturday and had such a great time! It was my birthday gift from Titi Yvonne, and Uncle Richie. I wore a crisp orange polo shirt, with my Abercrombie choker. My khaki shorts were accompanied by brown Aldo flip flops, and black Gucci glasses. I felt as hot as the thick atmosphere; I thought the black road was going to steam when my liquid joy hit it. We picked up Aunt Marisol in her uptown apartment, and drove down to park in Chelsea. We spoke of life, what we intended to buy, and what stores we were going to hit, as we walked to Citibank, and then a hole-in-the-wall pizza joint. I broke my 40 hour vegan pact once the cheese hit my palette. I wasn't too upset because my goal was only for 24 hours. I almost doubled it :D   Titi Yvonne (after coming out of the bathroom): omg, the toilet is overflowing. we need to leave now.  so we did... in fear that her urine would clean the dirty floors. the place was beyond gross. im surprised i even allowed myself to eat there. it doesnt even compare to the chino-cubano place we went to for dinner though. After pizza, we walked over to Barneys Co-op. The men were all gay - not a surprise when you hit any high fashion places. That is such a perk about shopping in the right places in the city - all the men who care about fashion are gay. So you can actually silently hit on people, and get hit on silently right back :D  The mannequins were decked out in beautiful coutour, ranging in price from 180 dollars to thousands. I walked over to the mens department, and checked out the Marc Jacobs, and Ben Sherman racks. The stuff was nice, but I wasn't in love with anything, so I passed on any purchases. But I did get my first glimpse of the hot Jack Spade canvas messenger bags. Then I walked over to the womens department to see what Aunt Marisol was looking at - a jacket. Very nice, with a look of something Arden B would sell. It was 380 dollars, so she didnt get it. But she decided to deck out the mullah later - which I'm glad she did, cuz it was a deal. Then I went to the skin care corner to see what products they sold. I recognized some Anthony stuff, which I've seen in Bath & Body Works. You know - the one where he charges 8 dollars for fucking lip balm. I was browsing and a gay guy near the hair products, who obviously worked there, said to me, "Are you looking for something in particular?!" Imagine a tone gayer than Jack on Will & Grace.   Me: Nah, I'm just browsing. Thanks though.  Him: Okay, well hang out with us! We're so much fun! (pointing to his coworkers in the department)  Nice guy. Gayer than Elton John's orange glitter suit. Gayer than a man wearing Mac makeup. But he was nice. And he was fun. And his eyes were so beautiful - he actually wasnt an attractive man - but his eyes were like a blue ocean. I've never seen anything to compare it to. We proceeded to leave Barneys - no body with any items yet. But this was only the begining of a spectacular day. Loehmanns was only a few blocks away, so we stopped there. I looked at some Calvin Klein suit pants - then dismissed it when I realized I had no use for them. Then I just browsed until I found the Marc Jacobs stuff. Wool grunge sweater, neon 80s-style jackets, workout attire. Nothing I was really looking for. But that is where I so celebrity #1 of the day: some hot guy from American Pie. He was also looking through Marc's stuff. I don't know his name, but my aunt did tell me later that he was from the movie. So yea... then we left. Again - I bought nothing. From there we walked all the way to Bleeker Street, which is the wonderful location of the three Marc Jacobs boutiques. On our venture over to the mens boutique, we saw celebrity #2: Meredith from The Bachelorette with the guy she chose on the show. My aunt was trying not to hyperventilate, as she is an avid fan. So we arrived at the boutique, she was hyperventilating because she had just been feet from Meredith, and I was hyperventilating because I was in the middle of beautiful coutour. It was amazing. I instantly fell in love with the "Marc Jackass" shirts - but they were 180 bucks. And for a tee, I'm not willing to spend that much. But I did  purchase two shirts: one with an Andy Warhol-style portrait of Hilary Clinton in red, on a white tee shirt (size: large. price: $55, no tax. all proceed go to The Friends of Hilary. [and i am such a fan of her. I LOVE HILARY! *deep breath* ok.]) and, a black shirt with Marc's skeleton sketchings all over the front (size: L. price: 100. all proceeds go to: the marc jacobs fund? lol). In particular, I liked Marc's political twist to his new clothes. For example, the Hilary shirt. And other shirts like one that said "Mad Cowboy Disease" with a picture of Bush, his various "Vote" shirts, Kerry yo-yos, and Bush administration playing cards (similar to the Iraq cards, except with members of the Bush administration; Bush being the Ave of Spades).  I sported my Marc Jacobs bag across town, and I felt so so so happy. He is my favorite designer for those of you who haven't picked up on that detail yet. We walked from Greenich Village, to the heart of Soho: Downtown Broadway. Prada, Armani, Bloomingdales. It was oh so great! Bloomingdales is unlike any store I have ever been - ever! You are first greeted by its spectacular facade facing the street. Pure white, with white columns - its so elegant. When you walk in, the floral scent of ritzy perfumes fills your nostrals. You walk past the makeup department; the men wearing thick stripes of blue makeup across their face - branding their homo-and-transexuality. I took the escalator down to the mens store, and searched out for Marc Jacobs' rack - and I found it, and the same exact skeleton shirt I just bought. For the same price, 100, but...but...but.... it was on sale!!! 33% off! That meant it was about 66 dollars! So I check my Marc Jacobs receipt..."exchange, or store credit only". So what do i do? I sat down in the huge Armani Casa chair, it's black leather arms hugging me, and I cried. And cried. And cried. Once I had let everything out, I went upstairs to the shoe department to find my aunts, and my uncle. Marisol was wrapping a Pucci scarf around her head and looking at herself in the mirror, while Yvonne was trying on the latest Prada heel. And I wondered if THEY would purchase it, and then find it on sale. *sigh* On the way out of Bloomingdales, I saw the Jack Spade messenger bag again - and fell in love with it even more. It came in an array of various colors: red, orange, yellow, black, white, navy, purple. It definately more expensive than the messenger bags at Old Navy, but I think once I save enough money for it, I will buy it. Afterall, Jack Spade's bags are even more revered than his wife's - Kate Spade. We left the building, and walked over to Union Square to meet David, Aunt Marisol's boyfriend. Then we were walking around the city like chickens without their heads. In need of food, we stopped at this chino-cubano place. It was stark, empty, and smelled putrid. But we ate their anyways. I ordered vegetable lo mein, and avacado salad. First time I've ever had chinese food, and cuban food at the same time. I must say, I was dissapointed with our choice in places, because I under the impression we were going to eat at Victors Cafe,  which offers 5-star cuban cuban cuisine, with clientelle ranging from Gloria Estefan, to Marc and Jennifer Anthony. Oh well.  During dinner we heard on the radio that there had been an explosion in Times Square. It was very brief. Just a woman announcing that there was an explosion, and nothing more. And I wasn't the only one who heard this - we all did. And we were worried, considering you could see the lights of Times Square in the distance from the resteraunt windows. We hadn't felt anything; no shaking. Later, though, we had confirmed that there was no explosion. Maybe an electrical fuse, or something small of that matter. But certainly nothing catastrophic, or terrorist related. We finished our food - which was mediocre - and left. We finished walked down the block, as I pondered over chinese people speaking spanish; it was definately the first time I've ever witnessed such a person. The adults talked among themselves, and when we reached the corner, we snapped a few photos, and said our goodbyes.   I fell asleep in the car, and when my Aunt Yvonne and Uncle Richie dropped me off at home she told me David had broken up with Marisol that night. I said, "Thank you for the memories!" And I walked to my door under the stars, thinking about how David picked such unfortunate timing, and wondering if my Aunt Marisol was crying on her hundred dollar pucci bandana she had just bought...

      A night with K-Mac, among others, has led me to these words of wisdom: I am hot, and everyone is subconciously attacted to me. Okay, so I've been thinking, and I've come to the conclusion that lesbians grandmas are awesome. And I wish my grandmother came a la dyke. Okay...I am done now.

      visions of greatness images haunting the mind whispers  of a future that cannot be seen of a cool breeze that has yet to brush our skin  we reached  for the unreachable we ran until our body failed we prayed to a God who may not be listening  but we have these dreams that push us along the way these hopes that fill us with power this faith that we will rise above and taste freedom  toiling for justice bleeding for hope dying for love what Fools we may be breathing truth in a sea of lies and so we will drown  yet love lies before us all we can do is take the step forward justice rests on the horizon all we can do is squint at its beauty stumble forward and know someday they'll feel the warmth upon their skin and smile in thanks to the souls who beat the path that lead to freedom  -Enrique Duques  This poem really touched me. Enrique is gay.

      Okay, does this gif not sum up what I'm all about?     yes - i think it does. Okay...so I'm bored out of my mind right now! I'm listening to my eclectic playlist:  Accidentaly in Love by Counting Crows The City of Angels Soundtrack The Best of Celine Dion Wicked Lara Fabian Supermodel by RuPaul  Take My Hand by Dido The Nearness of You by Norah Jones Turn Me On by DJ Kevin Lyttle  So right when you listen to a song that is so smooth and sad, the next song is pretty much a fashion runway song; which make you want to dance. Yay.

      I go on the school BBS to read this poem a friend wrote:  There are a few things You just shouldn't do Like telling someone you love them When you don't know if they love you My friends have been hurt by this And I'll admit I have been too It's just too bad for us, I guess That the problem is nothing new  We help each other through it Time after time it's the same It's like we all just never learn That such feelings aren't a game We can't just blame it on Cupid And say he'd better work on his aim And we can't just hide after we say it We can't be overwhelmed with shame  I know the feeling that I get The restlessness, I know it well The need to share how I feel It can be so hard not to tell My friends have to remind me Only I can break the spell And if I choose not to then I'm stuck And I've locked myself in that cell  I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't Waiting it out is the worst part But it's still so much better Than letting him break my heart So I keep it inside and only tell my friends It's the only choice I have that's smart I'd rather be silent and strong Than let him tear me apart  I hate myself sometimes For always feeling this way Even though I won't tell him I'll still rehearse words to say In this situation there's no black and white The only colors are shades of gray And in this in-between place I pretend I like to stay  I don't want to be thrown back Depression's never fun I'd rather come out at my own pace There's no race here to be won And I'll go through some hurting By the time that this is done But this way I'll get over it And still be able to love the sun  I hate it in the shadows They always make me feel so bad And if I let him put me there For a long time I'll feel sad Then when my friends get sick of it They'll tell me I make them mad But it hurts me so much more To pretend that I feel glad  So I'm saying this to warn you To watch out for things like this Things you shouldn't say or do Because there's too great a risk Even if it seems like it could work You might not find that bliss So just look out for big mistakes That could keep you from things you'll miss  -Sandi Gammon   I read this about an hour after my last very depressing post. And at the exact moment i finish reading it, the song I'm listening to sings, "It was only about an hour ago..." How fucking ironic is that?! And then I thought about the Friends rerun today on WB, when Monica tells Rachel not to tell Ross that she is still in love with him. "Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them, and not have them say it back?" Oh God, is this an answer to what I've been longing? Silence? Or is this just another stab into my already confused emotions? Dammit.

      ...is loneliness. So it really, really IS. Thank you Ingrid - for no truer words were ever spoken. I've come across this feeling for the second time... . The words of Sarah Mclachlan, Norah Jones, Barbara Streisand, Celine Dion all ring hollow in my ears. No Good Deed is quite suitable for this mood. My heart is now cold. It is a frozen icicle. And only the warmth of love can save it. But when it does, it will only melt it into a puddle of emotion. Like right now - small drops forming that puddle.  Love humiliates you. And hatred cradles you. Let this hatred flow within me, because I am tired of giving myself to you. I fucking love you! And I hate this feeling. I hate always thinking of you in every minute of the day. I hate dreaming of your touch. The thought of it stains my skin blue. I hate being arms length from you, and yet you're untouchable. I hate you for being someone I could fall in love with. You are the swift carpet beneath my feet. I hate how you bring me to my knees. They sob tears from this rough cement. I hate how every tear I shed was because of you. I hate love. I hate your smile. I hate your kind hearted self. I hate all the time we spend together, because it puts me further in this trance. I hate your style. I hate the great things you do in life. I hate the sweet words you say to me; the encouragement, the jokes, the stories, the small conversations - hate them all. And yet I cherish them all. I don't know what I would do without you. If I could, I wish I had the will to never speak to you again - yet I can't bare to inflict more pain upon myself. It would be like a death within my soul. That is how I know it's love.  I hate the fact that you're in my life. And I hate how you don't even known it's you. Because I fucking love you!  Reality has hit me. And it hit me hard. And even though I can feel its impact, I'm still in a daze. I don't know how I'm going to move on - and get the hell over your sorry ass. I have the opportunity to start dating a male model - but I know that if I start kissing him, I'll only be thinking of you. They say the universe works in favor of love. Well, what is it doing for me? I'm crippled. I'm so weak. I need love or I will bleed to death like a heart without a body. I suddenly appreciate the art of Frida Kahlo so much more; her artistic and visual connections between her love for Diego, and physical and emotional pain. Frida was in pain for her whole life -- and I wonder... am I going to be just like her? Or will I need to form an Ingrid-like facade to pull me through this? Afterall, Ingrid murdered her lover with the petals of an efflorating oleander...its poison soaking within his skin. What the hell is happening to me?! For such a strong person, why am I so fucking weak??  Appropriate Kahlo painting:     "You know when you see a couple embracing in the park, and you want to feel so happy for them because they are in love - but you just can't find it within you?" -The Perks of Being a Wallflower  I've proven that I am mentally insane after midnight. Save me.

      1.) Umm...has anyone seen the Bush ads? The only people "enjoying life" are white people. The only minorities are in uniform, or working for the white people. What is the subtext to that commercial?  2.) Can you tell Chris Mattews to shut the fuck up?! He keeps going on an on comparing Theresa Heinz Kerry to coffee. How she is an acquired taste, and how the first time he tasted coffee, he hated it. But now he can't get enough of it. omg he is so proud of this pathetic analogy. Turn on MSNBC right now, and I bet you he is still talking about it. Because it's all he ever talks about.  3.) Apparently that bitchass Ann Coulter was at the DNC. Umm why? Someone gave her a press pass. So on her column, she titles her article "Here at the Spawn of Satan Convention...". How the hell do people take her seriously? She is a fucking lunatic! I wonder if she is talking at the RNC... I mean, even some Republicans think she is totally mental. She's only a rascist, homophobic, anti-feminist. (check out her insanely warped ideas at www.anncoulter.org, if you dare!)

         Condoleeza Rice - I was always trying to like her. She got that jacked name, the god-forsacken afro-mullet, and she is a bad ass in so many ways, but why does she have to use her powers for evil? Why can't she be on our team? Is it possible that she really intends to defend the ridiculously tragic misadventures of our embarrassing Commander in Chief? There are not enough smoke and mirrors anywhere to distract us all from the appalling fact that the government has failed its people so grievously, so selfishly, so stupidly. Not even David Blaine can make that shit disappear. But in the end, Condoleeza is still a stupid bitchass. Behind every dumbass president, is a woman giving him bad advice. So I've decided to compile a mini scrapbook of hot pictures of Condi. Too bad I couldn't find one of her in a bikini...ow ow.      "Yo now...I gah what in mah teef?"    "Nuh uhh biznitch! Don't you know I am Condi, and I will kick your bony white ass in a second. Mmm mmm nah!"    "Yay, I got me a tax cut!"    "I am one badass Oreo cookie!"    I'm sorry, I wouldn't eat Condoleeza Rice even if she was the last woman on earth.     Have no fear America; Super Condi is here to save you!    "BLAGRRRRRRAHHGRR...I am possessed!!!!"    "What'd yah say?!?! Naw see...NAW. I'll bitch slap you from here to Iraq!"    "RAWR! --- Like my hair? It's SO Oprah meets Al Sharpton!"    "It was a costume mishap! Really - it was!"   Ow ow... flash that boob Condi !

      Life is a bitch. Just so happens that some bitches.... are nice. A few days ago I was sad, and now I'm uber happy. Life is so great sometimes. This afternoon was great! I went to see The Notebook with Brittany. Her first time, my second. Her reactions were great. She would gasp, put her hands to her mouth, and beg me to tell her how it ended because sitting through the drama was painful for her. I kinda teared towards the end, but I didn't bawl like I did the first time. Are you kidding me!...the first time I saw it I was stumbling out of the theatre, gasping for air, and crying to the point where my face was bloodrushed. It is such an amazing movie...go and see it! Today's weather was so beautiful, the clouds were perched high in the blue sky. The green trees raised their arms up to praise the heavens, and the birds were flying above beautiful Freehold. Now! Okay - we walked over to Nordstrom Cafe and I had a Blue Cheese and Pear Garden Salad. Yumalicious like whoa! Brit and I talked, and caught up on life. Gossiped about the forensics freaks. Hem hem...jess...hem hem...sanicola. Ew. Oh, and it turns out that Dan's sister and mother found out about his wiccan-ness. Ugh and they got into a fight. :'( They are so ignorant, they fucking threw away his Wicked soundtrack. Because Wicked is so fucking Wiccan! Ignorance yeilds hate! Do they honestly think that neopagan religions are satanic cults. What the fuck people!? That makes me so angry! I hate hate from first hand experience. Well, at least Dan has Diana's house right around the corner if he ever needs help.   My grandparents went on a date to see The Village today; their first time to the movies since The Exorcist came out in the 60s, i believe. (aww moment) 1, 2, 3! AWWWW! Okay, eww I hope they didn't suck face in public. That would be an eww moment. I honestly love my grandparents, because they are so eccentric it is positively awesome! She called me this morning to inform me that the psychic on the spanish channel says that Kerry is going to win. The same psychic who said Al Gore would win, and that whoever was in the White House would die. Umm yea, those things really happened. And she really believes it. She takes this psycho woman's words as THE word, amen! This is like the weirdest thing she has done since she planted plastic flowers in her garden, and stayed up all night to make sure no one stole them. Not even joking.   Tommorrow I'm heading over to my cousin Patty's house. She is married with monstrous kids. Max, 5, and (omg i forgot his name :-[ ), 3, are just ADD-crazed kids. And they are angels in Pattys eyes. I love Patty to death, because she has this awesome personality. But I dont know how I'm going to deal with her kids. Here is an example of how crazed Max is: he tortured the family dog one time by opening and closing a sliding door on his poor tail. Because of this Amber, the dog, had to have her tail amputated. The kid is going to murder someone, and spill apple juice on me! I dont know which scares me more! Hopefully it will go well though, because I love Patty to death.  Dunno if I have plans tonight, prolly not though because of the camp banquet robbing me of my friends! I really wanted to see Garden State, but it's all the way in Monmouth Mall, and I don't have anyone to go see it with. So yea... hope you all enjoy your weekend. All in all, today I learned that life has a funny way of treating us. It is such a bitch at times, dragging us to the lowest of lows; but at other times, it's chocolate-y sweet. Like a perfect song. A perfect star. A perfect melody. My friend Laura says that some people have souls... I hope someday I will discover mine, and build upon it. Maybe share it with people all around the world with as little as a smile. Ahhh, life.

      As you know, I am very vehement in my disapproval of the death penalty. I think it is inhumane, and disgusting. So here is an exposé on American executions. Think you are educated about the death penalty? Think again. (WARNING: THIS ENTRY IS GRAPHIC!)  Let’s start with the methods that are used in this country to put someone to death.  1) Firing Squad – In Idaho and Oklahoma, the firing squad is an option. In Oklahoma, this method is authorized only if a current method is found unconstitutional. Idaho authorizes it only if lethal injection is impractical – such as if the inmate was a heavy drug user and finding a usable vein is difficult. Utah also offers this method, but only for inmates who chose this option before it was eliminated. All three states offer lethal injection as an option.  If the members of the firing squad have good aim, death comes fairly quickly from blood loss. Sandbags are placed all around the inmate to soak up the blood.  2) Hanging – New Hampshire and Washington offer this as a way to execute an inmate. Both have lethal injection as an alternate method. New Hampshire only authorizes hanging if lethal injection cannot be used. Washington gives the inmate the choice between hanging and lethal injection. The prisoner would be weighed prior to the hanging to attempt to avoid a botched execution. If the rope length is incorrect, the inmate could be decapitated, or fracture-dislocation is not rapid. Other reasons for fracture-dislocation to not occur would be strong neck muscles, an unusually light weighing prisoner, or the noose not being positioned properly. When fracture-dislocation does not happen, the inmate dies from slow asphyxiation, which can take up to 45 minutes.  3) Gas Chamber – Arizona, California, Maryland, Missouri, and Wyoming use this method. Wyoming will only use it if lethal injection is found unconstitutional. People sentenced to death in Arizona before 11/15/92 can choose between lethal injection and the gas chamber. California gives the inmate choice between lethal injection and the gas chamber. Maryland gives the inmate the choice between lethal injection and the gas chamber as long as they were condemned to die before 3/25/94. Missouri statute leaves it unclear just who chooses the option – the inmate or the Missouri Department of Corrections. The inmate clearly does not lose consciousness immediately. They are aware and in agony for most if not the entire time. Their eyes pop, their skin turns purple, and they start to drool. Death comes from hypoxia (the cutting off of oxygen to the brain).  4) Electrocution – Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia use this method. Illinois and Oklahoma only offer this option if lethal injection (or in the case of Oklahoma, hanging as well) have been deemed unconstitutional. Until recently, Nebraska only used electrocution. Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Virginia let the prisoner choose this method or lethal injection. Arkansas lets inmates choose (if convicted before 7/4/83). All others must use lethal injection. Prisoners in Kentucky convicted before March 31, 1998 can choose lethal injection or electrocution. All others must take lethal injection. In Tennessee, inmates convicted after 1/1/99 must use lethal injection, those prior may choose electrocution.  In electrocution, it sometimes takes more than one jolt to kill the condemned. Sometimes their eyeballs will pop out and rest on their cheeks, and in some cases they have caught on fire.  5)Lethal Injection – 36 states, plus the US military and the US government use this as either the sole method of execution or as an alternative. The states not already mentioned as using this method are: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas.  With lethal injection, death results from anesthetic overdose and respiratory and cardiac arrest while the condemned person is unconscious.  Or are they unconscious?  The chemical pancuronioum bromide, which is widely used for lethal injections, could leave the prisoner wide awake and unable to speak or cry out as they slowly suffocate. The drug paralyzes skeletal muscles, but does not effect the brain or nerves. In fact, the American Veterinary Medical Association condemns the use of that drug in putting down animals “because the animal may perceive pain and distress after it is immobilized”.   Now what do you think about executions?

      We went to Westchester Union Square Hospital today, which is near Tremont Street in the Bronx, to visit the almighty sexiness that is my greatgrandmother. She looked good - the nurse says she has a gallstone and that the doctor would talk with her tommorrow about removing her gallbladder. :-/ I dont know... surgery is very dangerous with 90 year old women because of the effect that anestesia has on their body -- it has the potential to kill her. But apparently, the stone is very large and painful. Even though she is getting medicine from the IV, she is doing well, and is rather perky. She fussed over the card we gave her - "No soy negrita!" The woman on the card is fucking tanned, take. a. chill. pill. She would joke around with me, "Eres feo." Then she would laugh. "A quien do you belong to?" I would point to her and say, "You." and she would giggle in her old woman cackle. My cousin Iris, who is around 65 years old, and in the last stage of emphasemia, was there too. Iris and abuela are really close (live in the same apartment building), related as aunt-and-niece. Iris utilizes an oxygen tank, with wires that go up through her nose, and give a heavy sigh with each inhilation. Only 30% of her lung mass is usable - she will die soon. But boy-oh-boy, you have not lived until you see someone with emphasemia laugh. I guess we took her breath away with our funny stories, and memories. My sister was under the age limit for visitation by four years - so she waited downstairs with my dad. I said goodbye to abuela, considering this may be the last time I ever see her alive. Afterall, Andy Warhol died from complications of gallbladder surgery. *cringes* And for the second half of our visit, I swapped places with my dad, to watch Jenna. We sat in the small eatery next to the first floor waiting room. I ate the rest of her swiss cheese sandwich, bought cheese doodles, and then refused to eat them when I discovered they were made out of corn meal. Corn does not equal cheese in my world.  Dios me bendiga , I guess I'm  chocha like that. I played I-Spy with Jenna. I told her to look for something red, in a room were 95% of the things were horrifyingly red and pink. When she couldn't guess, I told her she lost, and tried to read more of Hemingway's The Old Man & The Sea, then stopped because I wanted to kill myself. Hemingway's stories = Nesdill story.  We drove Iris home from the hospital. She almost suffocated in the car because my mom was wearing perfume. In the end she was okay, and I listened to Celine Dion on the ride back home. We stopped at Burger King, and I wound up eating french fries for dinner. Fuck that shit - I told my parents that if I ever got a gallstone, they would be paying for my surgery. The fries were so damn salty, I worry that my body will now retain water, and my feet will swell up.  Dios mio!  Today did give me alot to think about though. Reexamination of life, its values, its mysteries, its horrors, and so on. I realized that if she were to die, what unfortunate timing it would be. But then again, I guess there really is no  good  time for a funeral. Staring at her lifeless body would scare me though. I learn to hold onto what I have, and be grateful. Because one day, I may turn out just like the sexiness that is la chula de bronx - my greatgrandmother.

      Saturday: I woke up at noon, and we were at of the house at 2 pm; on our way up to Old Tappen, NJ (Bergen County). It would be a day to visit my cousin Patty, her husband, and her two sons. We drive up Fred Street, where she lives, and it looks like a scene out of The Stepford Wives. I was waiting for Glen Close, Bette Midler, and Nicole Kidman to pop out and give me some Stepford cookies, with some Stepford milk; with a pearly white smile and untouchable hair. And maybe they would help me spell out "Big Jew" on their front lawn with pine cones. Mark, her husband is jewish, and she converted when they married 10 years ago - that is why I say that. He wasn't there yesterday because he was in Isreal. Insanity - why would anyone go there now, of all times, among all this violence. Anyways, I have yet to come across a home more beautiful, and large, as Patty's. Her husband is a millionaire stock broker, and oh boy do they live life well. In the afternoon, the adults and I stayed inside to share stories, while the kids were outside in the pool with Etna, their maid. She had this huge Silver Pallette cheese and cracker spread out for us. The adults drank wine, and I just enjoyed my grapes. Again, I have never met anyone who can tell a story like Patty; she has her voices, and her actions blocked well, as if she was going to perform in a forensics round. But it isnt reheresed of course. She told us about the time when she had to speak in front of a court, and she had made the mistake of wearing low ride pants, with a pink thong. Ouch. But it's okay, she can pull it off. She may be 37, but she doesnt look it at all. Skinny, beautiful, and energetic. Then, there was this other time when she went to a makeup session with some ritzy makeup designer, and she was the only woman there who was not plastic. You just need to see her "surprised eye lift" or "botox injected lips" imitations. lmao, great stuff. "And when I was walking out, I checked my little goodie bag they gave me, and there was a gift certificate there for a face lift! Wow, so the makeup industry and cosmetic surgeons are now in cahoots...jeez."  Most rich people are very phony because they feel they have a certain type of air that they need to carry along with them. But Patty is totally not like that. She is the true boriqua, and will tell any stranger where they can go, or what they could do to themselves. But she still has great taste. Mark bought a plasma tv for his gym, so she got an allowance. So she spent it on a beauitufl 1754 antique dining room table from Boston, a Guatamalan antique coffee table for the living room, and an antique Asian furtniture peice for her unfinished formal living room. Gorgeous! When dinner was ready, we all moved outside to the east-wing porch. It overlooked the pool, the playground, luscious green grass, and beautiful landscaping, as well as the tall trees of a forest her house backs into. It was so beautiful. Dinner consisted of arroz con pollo (i took out the chicken), spinich keish, corn on the cob, garden salad with feta cheese, and pasta salad. It was very delicious - and for dessert we had fruit salad, coconut custard pie, five-fruit pie,  and apple pie (which she warmed up so we could have it a la mode). Chocolate ice cream melted upon my slice of apple pie, and I enhaled it, while quenching my thirst with some exotic type of coffee. I dont know what kind of coffee it was, but it definatey had a bite, and nutty twist - very good. The maid cleaned up, and we talked for the rest of the night. I think the weirdest line of the day was, "I dont like leather seats, they act up my hemmorhoids." My grandfather said that at dinner. You definately look at people differently whenever they say that. In fact, there is a theory that if you make the person you like say, "My hemorhoids popped this morning." you will never find them remotely attractive again. I can see why - very gross. But comments like that make my family what it is.  Patty is my stepford cousin. She is beautiful, skinny, loving, funny, warm, and lives in a beautiful house with a breathtaking backyard. And yet she is not robotic or fake. She is a real person, who wants to help the world. And she will do that with time. I realized she wasn't fake when she showed us her newly renovated master bathroom. It is huge, about three times the size of my room, with windows that span an entire wall up. The wall being about a floor and half high - maybe two. And I asked her, "Why don't you have curtains?" And she responds, "I like to give the deers something to look at." Hahaha, okay wow my family is so outrageous. I know I was kinda worried yesterday about her energetic kids - who I swear must have ADD or ADHD. But they mellowed out. Mind you, they still had energy, but it wasnt violent, and was easily controlable. And I feel most, if not all, kids are like that around their ages. So I kinda gave the adults a break and hung out with the awesome 7 and 3 year olds. They showed me their dragons upstairs in their rooms. And when I hear the word "dragon", I think of some fire breathing moster who will smear blood on my precious clothes. Or something that will pee on me. But in reality, they are cute little lizard-like animals. Max gave them some fucked up names, I dont even remember them, but they are really out there. He insisted I hold one, and plopped it down on my hand. I just examined its beautiful scales; they were so perfect and beautiful. His chest went up and down, and he just looked at my with his black eyes. They were so beautiful. But then Max put the other one on his shirt, and it climbed up his chest. He wanted me to do the same thing. Heh, not on my Armani. So I didn't. I had fun though, and I hope they enjoyed my company. I mean - who doesn't enjoy a little bit of Joe!? *cricket cricket* Ok...well....yea. We left around 1030, and as we meandered through the dark roads of Old Tappan, my mother's voicemail alerts her. Two phone calls: Sonya (my greatgrandma's home keeper), and my Aunt Yvonne. Apparently my greatgrandmother is in the emergency room. My sister starts to cry, even though she has no idea why she is in the ER in the first place. I felt so much anger towards my sister, and my mom who was obviously nervous. Why are they so selfish? They will be the first people to claim they believe in fate, and that God controls death --- yet they don't want her to die. Why? If you loved her as much as you say you do, why can't you just put your trust in God? She is 90 years old, its going to happen to her soon. If it is really her time to leave this world, then be that as it may. I know I took advantage of every minute I was with her, as if each was its last. Why couldnt you do the same? And that is why I felt anger. Don't they realize that life is fragile, and that tommorrow may not be there? Life is like sand slipping through your fingers; take advantage of its smooth, yet rocky texture until it is all gone. I may be a very deep, artistic, emotional, fragile person -- but when it comes to realizing life's philosophies, mysteries, and wonders, I sit back, and let whatever is going to happen to me, happen. So on Sunday, today, I will be spending my time in a musty Bronx hospital room, around people who just don't know how to let go.

      I watched Lost In Translation in complete darkess last night. I hated the movie - but loved being in such darkness. Darkness really calmed my boredom, and depressed mood. The movie was horrible though. The direction was good, but the acting was bland, the plot was slow to unfold, and the screenplay had no purpose. Sophia Coppula does not deserve the praise, or the Academy Award for that movie. Because of the Yankeee game, Big Brother 5 was delayed until 1:37 am. Talk about random time. So me, being the Big Brother whore that I am, stayed up to watch it. Chappelle's Show came on at midnight - amazingly funny. Then at 1230, Frida came on on Starz. I saw the first hour of it, considering I had to see Big Brother. But from what I saw, it is such a great movie. The acting was great, the direction was excellant, and the script was very accurate. They explain most of her paintings accurately, and the emotions she was feeling. The story of Frida is powerful, and from what I saw of the movie, it looks effective and superb. Now all I gotta do is actually finish watching it next time it comes on tv. When Big Brother ended at 237 am, I was kinda bored. I didn't want to go to sleep, and no one was online. So I spent a half hour writing 2 haikus. Here's what came of that:  -1-  rose petals look up to the white sun. you and i, this gray thunderstorm.  -2-  when i look into your eyes, angels' wings are sharp. i bleed helplessly.   Number 1 was inspired by Janet Fitch's poem found in White Oleander. You guys should know what I'm talking about since I share that poppies poem with everyone. Okay, so I went to sleep and woke up at 930 so I could leave for the Bronx at 1030. I went with my Grandma, and Mom to see my greatgrandma. She is home now - they opted not to do the surgery, but to let her pass it naturally. On the drive up, we hit some traffic at the George Washington Bridge, and my grandma got so frusterated, the spanish curses rolled off her tongue. It was quite amusing. When we arrived in the Bronx, before we went to abuela's apartment, we stopped at a deli to pick up some cold cuts, and italian bread. The man who served us was the hottest middle aged man who I ever saw. Ow ow. We then headed over to her apartment, where we spent about 2 hours talking in spanish - the older women telling funny stories. Iris was there - and I felt so bad, because she was laughing so hard. And I was kinda worried for her. But she seemed to enjoy herself. The drive back was hell !!! We hit the big storm on the cross bronx; it was pouring and hailing with thunder and lightning. Once it died down, we hit a second storm in Old Bridge. Overall, it took us 2 and half hours from the bronx to freehold. HELL! UGH! But I wrote 2 more haikus! All inspired by the bad weather:  -1-  lightning flashes in thick gray mist. lovers caress, enveloped in rain.  -2-  skies open, broken heart gushes liquid crystal: mother nature cries.  Here I am now. I'm gonna watch Will & Grace, and Seilfeld reruns. A new Amish In The City comes on tonight too! Woo hoo! I want comments and critisism on my poems bitches!
