      The Big Day has arrived  Tomorrow, our little family is being scattered to the four corners of the earth as M heads for NY with her sister to see her ex sister in law, while the boy and I are catching an early flight from Exeter to Malaga. M has a place to stay and has bought tickets for a "Show"while we have no accomodation or onward transport booked at all. On arrival in Malaga, we will head for the port and book a ferry to Melilla in Spanish north Africa. Then we'll stay the night there. The next day we plan to catch a bus to the border and then make our way to the nearby city of Nador. We will then catch a bus, if possible, to Fes. If we can hire a car there even better as it makes us independent. Once in Fes we will head south to the Middle Atlas where Barbary Apes (I told him we could go to Gibraltar for them, but apparently they weren't exotic enough) apparently await us plus the edge of the Sahara. A car will be hired from Fes if need be. There is a geocache on the way south so that will be a nice distraction. A second night in Fes will then precede, hopefully, the trip in the return direction. I suspect it is cramming too much into a short period. Obvious worries are lack of transport to/from Fes at times that arrive at the destination at a reasonable hour. The only schedule I have found would have us arrive in Fes at 2am, not a pleasant prospect with no hotel booked. Also there is some doubt about return boats from Melilla to Malaga: if they dont return on Sundays for the Monday am flight we are screwed. Our last trip away together, 2 years ago, from Helsinki to Devon by public transport, resulted in a similar rushed trip, from Helsinki to Talinn, Riga, Vilnius, Warsaw, Prague, Munich and Luxembourg, by bus and train. Maybe it's him, maybe it's me. I blame the boy. His new Dell PC arrived today. The contents of his desktop are all over the floor, while the PC has pride of place. One day he will clear up. The 4th member of our family, H, is staying here in town and will come up to feed the cats while we are away. She left (eventually) a year ago (oh what grief she caused) when her baby girl came along. She's happy in her flat with her man, but every now and then she needs the space and comes to stay up here. I wont be doing this for a few days. I'll report back. A

      Geo cache failure plus self-hypnosis  Party last night in the big city. Well, Exeter, which to us in the sticks IS the big city. We took the MG which I was allowed to drive at alarming speed (telltale sign of alarmingness being the gritted teeth and white knuckles from M in the passenger seat). Fine birthday evening in pub and Indian restaurant meant a 3 am finish (where did the time go?). Bright and early this morning we set off for our 3 stage City centre geo-cache hunt, which we negotiated successfully until it came to find the actual thing. Two attempts under the watchful eye of curious passers-by lead to an unsuccessful conclusion. I have suffered from what is termed Irritable Bowel Syndrome for donkeys years but this weekend it was particularly uncomfortable. However, a moment of inspiration took me to the Self-hypnosis book and 10 minutes of exercise with it made quite a difference. I don't believe in it, of course, but hey, if it helps a little bit, it can't be all bad. If anyone who reads this has any tips about IBS I love to hear from you. That wasn't "Irritable Bowel Syndrome for Donkeys", just Irritable Bowel Syndrome, BTW A

      The Incompetence of Transport Planners I deal a lot with public transport in my job, and also use it a lot, as everyone should. This ensures minimal use of the old BMW. Normally, M and I go in to Torquay together in the car and I come home on the train, because she stays on to do overtime or go to the dentist/gym/hairdresser, while I come home at a reasonable time. Fridays, we normally drive home together as she finishes at 4.15 on a Friday, a very wise and sensible time to finish, if you ask me. Also, one Friday in 4, I give a lift to someone to a meeting in the afternoon, and then take them home, before picking M up, which was what was scheduled for today. Also today, M was having her hair done after work so I would have to repark the car after the meeting, so she could pick it up, and then i would catch the train home. Unfortunately, having parked the car, I realised that I didnt have time to walk to the station. Solution? Go to the pub and wait for the next train. Problem? Didn't leave enough time to get to the station. So having missed the train, with a long wait to the next, I decide to head back to town on the bus to catch M with the car. These buses are all brand new, disabled friendly lowfloor buses that Stagecoach have just kindly introduced. On a ten minute frequency. Yeah right. 25 minutes later one rolls up, followed shortly by another. I know it is scientifically explained why buses hunt in twos (or even threes) but I always have this naive hope that it wont happen to me. It would have been easier to take the car (or even two cars as we werent coming home together) and that is why so many people take their cars and sod the pollution and the congestion. If I cant do it properly, then who else will? The other moral is: dont go to the pub if you are waiting for a train.  Andy

      Public Speaking and teenagers  Today, the day of the great "Torbay Transport Summit", attended by Councillors, public transport operators, council officers and other interested parties. I have been allocated the role of leading a workshop on Social inclusion and access for all. So I turn up late and settle in at the back for a good read of the paper (in particular an article on the sayings of Muammur Ghadafi, apparently a certifiable loony who needs a good slap). My guts are utterly rotten, so several trips to the loo are in order. Additionally, a former councillor is attending who has forgotten his papers and his lighter, so several trips to the back door are in order for a fag. After lunch come the workshops and they don't go too badly. We get a little off topic and I am not sure if a few eyebrows aren't raised in boredom or disgust, but they all seem happy in the end. Then I had to sum up my bit to the whole meeting, during which I get a freeze, where brain and co-ordination cease to function. Struggle out of it with the "and that was it and I'm sure we'll be taking your suggestions forward in the future" manoeuvre and at one bound I was free. Not a bad do , but I will always hate public speaking, especially without notes. Good job there's not much chance of my daughter getting married soon. i'd hate to embarass her like that. Talking of embarassment, having returned from Tesco's tonight, we are greeted at the door by the boy saying how I'd embarassed him by sending off a travel form of his to his mum (who is rich and left home when he was 9 months, and frankly, has never paid maintenance), without the required £25 fee involved which the boy was going to pay himself. One, I have little memory of sending the ruddy form without the £25, even if I knew it had to have £25 attached, two I wouldnt have deliberately embarassed him, third, who does he think pays for everything round here. Fourthly, he has the front to have a go at me about M for commenting about points two  and three, to me, (and not to him). She, who has not a horrid thing to say about anyone  and who has been extremely kind, tolerant and generous to him. Especially when I think about the shit he has taken off his mother, and off my evil former girlfriend. I will slap him a great deal if he does it again. Teenagers: ask one now while they still know everything.  Ooo that was a rant. Now over

      Gloss paint, bosses and young children  Gloss paint is so annoying. It doesn't cover properly, it gets everywhere, it doesn't come off your hands, it ruins the brush and you have always run out of white spirit just when you need it. Also the bottle of washing up liquid gets covered in the stuff, Get rid, that's what I say. And it gets on the floor. The boss, at a loss as to what last minute preparations for tomorrow's "transport summit" he should make, gives me the task of running a "workshop" called "Accessibility and Social Exclusion". OK, I know something about it, but, in my present state, I am really not up to doing "public" things, what with depression and terminal shyness and things like that. I also have to wear a suit tomorrow. god. damn. ekk. I would really like just to be left alone in my little box. But then, why would they pay me for that? As for the little girl, young Melissa, aged 1 year and 2 weeks, cried when I tried to take her from M tonight. She even prefers her own mother to me. Fickle, these kids.  She'll be buying her own presents if she doesnt realise where her responsibilities lie soon. She just doesnt see where her proper priorities are.  Andy

      Traffic  Trust it to be my luck that the day I have to go into Torquay twice in the morning is the day that Kingskerswell is closed. Kingskerswell is the only way to get into Torquay, without going on the back roads. It's the A380 from Exeter. The sea is on 2 sides and so there is no other way. A bypass for Kingskerswell has been mooted for years but has been continually delayed. Personnel changes at the Government Office for the South West, among other things, like lack of money, and the fact that Devon County Council dont care,as they will have to pay for it but it doesnt help a town in Devon (Torbay is unitary) have meant it has always been forgotten about. So, this morning an accident meant it was shut. 1000s of motorists were therefore forced to choose another route, if they weren't stuck already (it took some people 2 and a 1/4 hours to get to work). We merrily set off to Torbay Hospital (for my daughter's post natal gynaecolgical progress report) and noticed the horrendous traffic coming the other way and related this it to the accident reports from Kingskerswell. A good 2 mile queue. The exam was short sweet and painless and allowed young lady Melissa to wander around the ward and charming the patients as she went while she waited for her mum. Having dropped M off for work after the hospital, I took little Melissa and H my daughter home, hoping the queues would have subsided.No chance. However, as the divertees did not know the route, I took the usual country and village lane routes and skipped a good 200 cars length with very little delay, except for the bridge at Shaldon. Anyway, what took the rest half an hour, took me 10. A victory for local routes and local people, as they say. Of course, I then had to get back to work in Torquay, but starting work at 11 holds no fear for me. Oh no. Nothing wrong with a 5 hour day and a 1 hour lunch break. Ha!

      Creating a Video Suite  I have recounted how we narrowly avoided sending 600USD by Western Union to an address in London in order to facilitate the purchase of a laptop for the boy, from the US of A (or helping some scally to purchase a kebab shop in Islington, more likely). The boy continued his dream of IT heaven by ordering a PC and DVD rewriter from a reputable company in Cambridge (in Cambridgeshire ie a proper way of buying things on this microwave thingy). Unfortunately, when he rang them up today, they revealed that no screen was included in his package (more careful scrutiny may have revealed this). Having cancelled it, and received email confirmation of the cancellation, he rang "Dell" directly and was rewarded by a call from an Indian call centre.The nice lady talked him through it, and even wished him a personal "goodbye" while I was talking to her, which was sweet, he can be very charming when he wants. They didnt take the boy's "electron" card, so muggins had to use his visa card to purchase a box with a DVD rewriter and a flat screen. That's now in the post and hopefully will arrive before we go to Morocco in a few days. The whole point of this is to kickstart the boy's budding video career by letting him make sk8bd videos, something he has previously done with great success (wit, technique and humour being his strongpoints). Previously he has got by by using a "canopus" box to download his movies back to VHS (and that took me 9 months to sort out), after creating his movies in "Ulead". Now he will be able to do it direct to DVD. His new camera also supports "in" so he can download the finished version back to DV tape as well. I wish him well. He wants to create his own website to promote his movies. Obviously the financial risk is now mine (to the tune of £550) but, hey, I've got his electron card in my pocket. With the PIN. hahahahaha. Mine forever. I hope it works out. He's my boy and he gets what he wants (just like his mother, who has married a millionaire ie not me). I am so glad he lives with me, he's a joy.

      Geocacheing Day First time geocacheing with a GPS today. I had waymarked the cache and the car park. With M having a soft top car, the car park was a doddle, although the speed was a trifle different than that indicated by the car's speedo. On top of Haldon (where once I used to kid the children there were wolves in the forest, and perhaps for a minute they believed me). A scramble downhill through uncharted pine forest led us to be more patient and use the actual paths cut through the forest. There were few paths so finding the cache was relatively easy. M found it, for the second time, by her sheer determination to dig through the undergrowth and dead leaves, plus a large amount of common sense. We found a travel bug, which is currently imprisoned here before me, awaiting his trip to Spain and Morocco. On the way back to the car, the GPS took a rather alarming attitude and insisted we take the opposite direction to where we knew the car was stationed. I checked the co-ordinates and they were right so I dont know what was wrong with the little blighter. M assumed they tell you what to do but I assured her they were not as bossy as that, so we overcame it, found the car and went shopping in Exeter. If we had obeyed the GPS we would no doubt be being eaten by wolves at this very moment. Anyway, the bug is 465048 if you'd like to track it. He's a little troll called Mr Haldon B Gonk.

      4 generations and yet another death  Mum and dad are here this weekend. I have already recounted how the flowers were delivered 4 days early for Mothering Sunday. However, flowers given early have enhanced mum's weekend by being on display in their bedroom all weekend. Today, my daughter(and her daughter) were around for the day and all 4 generations of us took the morning train for Torquay to visit "Living Coasts", the marine aviary at Torquay harbour. We have never been, even though we work in Torquay. It was very impressive, despite the foul weather. Unfortunately, during our visit, an incident occured. We saw staff scuttling towards some scene of crisis and we assumed some scallies had broken in and were doing the usual stuff that that Torquay scallies do, but no. An unfortunate wader type bird had decided to change ponds and land in the enticing waters of the seal pool. Needing no encouragement, a seal took its opportunity and took the unfortunate bird from beneath and behind (no doubt a male seal). All that was left were feathers. There were few witnesses. After that, lunch was delicious(not sea bird), as was supper, much later at the local Italian restaurant. the only downside was the 3/4 hour wait for the bill. I would have walked but the parents were there. You have to show some maturity now and then. The Garmin etrex GPS showed us the way home with startling accuracy, but since we already knew the way, it was a trifle superfluous. More development needed, I feel.  Andy

      Shopmobility  I am lucky enough to chair the Shopmobility facility in TXXXXX, which a has 3 shops, loaning scooters and stuff to disabled people. Being charities, they have to raise money, because the council can't pay for everything, and they are run by volunteers. Each is fiercely independent. So they had a joint do in February which raised loads of money, some of it done independently, some of it on the day. You wouldn't believe the squabbling about how the money ought to be split. The ones with the most initative made the most money whilst others made less. Of course, each wanted to take away the rewards of their own efforts. Compromises will have to be made, and I'll have  to be in the middle to sort it out. I wish they'd realise we are all in it together. Even though I am the only one being paid. They all have their own empires, and I, like a proper emperor, can only advise and lead by example. Andy It's so depressing sorting all these conflicting things out

      Being 21  We had a visit this evening from a young woman. She was accompanied by her boyfriend/partner and their one year old daughter. She's 21 today, so I dug out a bottle of champagne from the Hutton cellars and we celebrated while trying to stop the little girl escaping, or touching bad things or generally getting into bad scrapes, as one year olds do. The little girl is very very cute. One of her tricks is to "adult surf", reaching out from adult to adult until she reaches the object of her desire, usually a cat. Anyway, most 21 year olds would probably be out celebrating, hiring village halls for a party or getting blind drunk in the pub. Not this one. She is off home at 10 to 8 to put her baby to bed, not even accepting the offer of a fine veggie chili (courtesy of M, thank you very much, my dear).She's had a hard time, this woman, as she has chosen to have a baby at a young age and live on benefit, as her partner doesnt work (he rarely leaves their flat), and she chose not to have a career or go to college. They get by and the baby is flourishing. They have a soon to be lovely flat which they are busy (and very slowly) rebuilding from the inside out, even though it is rented. It's taken them a long time to get a decent home after bitter arguments with her father, being chucked out of another flat, at great expense, and various "incidents" with the boyfriend. I think she has made some bad decisions in her life. Anyway,  she gave me a lovely kiss before she left. I have known her since she was a baby. She's my daughter and I am very proud of her.

      Buyingstuff off the microwave/internet thingy  1 ebay, to buy a GPS which I finally win. It takes 5 minutes to pay for it using paypal which is so easy. Unfortunately, I had forgotten that the account uses by bank account and not a credit card so I'll have to go easy til payday. Also I have to wait for the GPS to arrive (from California) so it's still on trust. Anyway, seems like a piece of cake. So far. It's worked before with my Leicester City dvd.  2 Western Union. The boy spots a compaq laptop with all the stuff he wants on it for video editing, from some organisation in Minnesota. $600 post free to the UK which has got to be 1/3 the UK price. Excellent. Drawbacks: they want payment by Western Union which involves giving 600 USD (and how many 17 year olds have access to 600USD just like that? 600UKP possibly but what a palaver) to a travel agent who Western Unions it to an address in London. Then you email the company in Minnesota to tell them what you have done with no apparent guarantee that the bloke in London isn't off down to Islington to invest in a new kebab shop? Rubbish it seems to me, in this day and age. However, the attraction of a new laptop for £350 seems pretty high and might be worth the hassle and risk. Doesnt seem right it's so difficult though. Bleedin Yanks. 3 Buying flowers. Get the flowers for Mother's Day on the internet, all the way from Jersey. It's just as easy to see what you want on the net and then ring them up which I did. Give them the details and wow, the stuff arrives. OK, they were a bit enthusiastic, and I am now in possession of a box of flowers when my mother doesnt arrive here until Friday, but, what the heck, it's paid for and I've got the flowers.  The message? Who knows? I haven't been ripped off yet and its nearly as much fun as actual shopping. And cheaper. Finally, the boy says he has wiped a load of "internet files" to speed the computer up. Obviously this is normally a task to be reserved for when one is drunk and/or angry. Hence when I did it, it resulted in my deletion of Outlook Express. When he did it, it resulted in a much faster computer and everything works. I still say my way is best.  Andy

      Four Journeys and a Funeral  As I said yesterday, we went to a funeral today. It's a long drive from Devon to Amersham, so we set off early, just after the boy left for school. M drove, in her lovely MGF (reassuring to know that MGs are still noisy, rattly, prone to leaks and vaguely unreliable). The journey was uneventful and we were able to have lunch in an Amersham pub without too much pressure of time. Parking was difficult at the crematorium. The 2nd journey involved John, who lived with G for 7 years before she died. I dont know him well but loved the brief day in the Scillies we spent with him and G a couple of years ago when several of our party spilled our breakfasts onto the floor of the pleasure boat, due to the extreme state of the waves. He knew she was very ill before they started but persevered nonetheless. He could barely speak at the crematorium, he was so utterly devastated. I could see his shoulders wrenching up and down, with his dad and brother comforting him. His journey still has some way to go. The 3rd journey was G's. Her cancer lasted for years and cost her dearly. So many of her workmates turned up to say goodbye. Over 100. (sometimes at the crematorium, NO-ONE turns up. How sad is that ?). Lovely service and Me , M and M's sister were the last to leave the chapel, so silly and emotional were the three of us. Journey 4 and I drove back down the 303 and A30. What a lovely country we live in with its hills and mists and sunsets. Converted cinema to a pub in Chard provided a sufficient cooling down spot for a chat, a rest and a recollection of G and her tragically short life (aged 52). As a footnote, I won a Garmin etrex GPS on ebay today, and the boy tried unsuccessfully to pay, by Western Union or Moneygram or something, for a laptop from the USA. The good people at the Post Office asked him what the rate was for the dollar. Like yeah, 20 to the pound man, I would have said, but maybe that wouldnt have worked. Surely it's up to them to say what the exchange rate is?   Andy

      Money and death  On the subject of money, the boy had his birthday on Saturday. Among other things I bought him a new DV Camera to replace his knackered old one. I shared the vast cost with his mother, who lives in The Smoke and had said she would help pay for the repair to his old one. He wasn't expecting it cos he thought he was getting a brief trip to Morocco (which he is, and we'll do some geo-cacheing. I will return to this another time.). His reaction was great, a real treat from a 17 year old. The cost of repairing the old one was nearly as much as the new one. Anyway, I banked his birthday money into his current account at the Post Office (so he could transfer it to his ISA - at 17 he has an ISA!). Sunday he presents me with another £115 in cash which he has saved from his part time job as crockery hygiene technician and trainee Jamie Oliver, so I had to go back to the PO today to deposit further ill-gotten gains (though well earned, really). This does not prevent him asking me to insert 20p into his lunchbox so he could afford a hot choccie at school. Careful with the pennies and the pounds will look after themselves (or dad will). Then I catch him fretting whether he can afford a laptop, having rung Dell to get a quote for his specific desires and having to balance that against his wish to go travelling. A choice I would like to have. Against that, tomorrow, M and I are going to a friend's funeral. First one of our (nearly) generation. Ill for years, G finally succombed last week, to her husband's great great sadness, and all who knew her. Not old enough to die and very brave, she will be missed. The worries of youth and the worries of the adult. What can you say? Enough, already.

      OK. Hello. I don't suppose anyone will read this. Today, M and I took ourselves off to our first geo cache. I had printed directions as we don't yet have a GPS and I knew the area well anyway, just over the estuary in Shaldon. M didn't really believe me about geocaching so when we parked at the end of the empty car park, she nervously said "Is this "dogging"?", which I thought was a little strong, Stanley Collymore being nowhere in sight. Anyway, up into the woods, through the mud. Find the bench and the trees but no cache! Eventually, M comes up with it, buried in the dead leaves, under a tree trunk. We opened it, looked at the cute stuff, signed the book, and I left an old thruppenny bit(which I quite treasured), plus some rain and mud, as the weather was appalling. After that we drove to Stoke Gabriel, which is posh, for a jolly lunch. Cooking supper tonight, I accidentally flicked the boy's steak on the floor, just as he came into the kitchen. Unfortunately, the "5 second rule" (ie if it's on the floor for less than a minute, it doesn't matter- (copyright- the Merman)) didn't count as he is a teenager and very fussy. He might not do any washing up at home but he sure knows about hygiene!. Then I served it up with blood in it. Not much, but enough. (I never ever cook steak as I am a vegetarian), which sealed its fate. A tragic end to the steak, but, lo, a vegetarian teenager. Hooray. Maybe I'll try this again tomorrow

      Anger. Despair. Horror I've just seen the TV pictures of Americans and British "Soldiers" treatment of Iraqi people, with their piles of naked people and the grinning faces of the American soldiers. These are real people like you and me. My fingers can barely type. And I bet those pictures aren't the worst they could do. What the hell is this country doing being involved in this? I've seen nothing more disgusting since the film of people launching themselves from the top floors of the World Trade Centre on 11/9. I don't have words to express my disgust. It is medieval in its horror. Representatives of the "free world" and "democracy"? In your dreams. What is going on?  There will be a reckoning for this outrage. And it will be you and me that catch the consequences. Usual internet expressions of outrage will not do. I cannot contain myself. Fuck them. I am so angry.  Andy

      An Atmosphere, and a long ride home  Normally, I cadge a lift to work with the good lady, and catch the train home afterwards. Today was the same. Today, however, I was not in a good mood, and after a couple of minor incidents, which at the time,I considered life threatening, e.g. driving the wrong way in the car park in order to attain the habitual space, but not stopping for oncoming vehicles, I was thoroughly grumpy. Having voiced my opinion (and normally we are unbelievably sweetness and light, a happy example of true love), I stumped off to the office. Months of understaffing ensured that I was still deeply concerned about the lack of progress on various projects I have neglected, which did not add anything positive to my mood. Yet again, though, I was deeply impressed by my new colleagues attitudes and grasp of their tasks. I was impressed by their ability to humour me and to not make cutting comments about my ignorance of subjects about which they seem so much more au fait than me. I think I am being treated like the respected old duffer who sits in the corner, but once fought at the Battle of Omdurman, or whatever. It's never happened to me before. Usually I just feel like the kid, and everyone else is older and wiser. It's the stuff which I have let build up which depresses me. Anyway, work over, I amble to the station, catching the train by a whisker. Unfortunately, the signals between Newton and Teignmouth are broken, and we limp lamely along, stopping every few yards. I know they have to worry about safety, but it took 40 minutes to do 6 miles. Surely, in broad daylight they could just do 20 mph and keep a lookout? After all, there was nothing in front of us. Too much safety culture and a lack of resources to sort it out quickly. Anyway, all the trains are now passing the back window very slowly and hooting carefully as they find their way in the murky darkness. On my eventual return home, I detected a distinct atmosphere over the strong words that were spoken this morning. All peace and light on the surface, and it is probably just me, but it is not the usual happy atmosphere. It is all in my head, I suppose. One fly in the ointment is the boy, who is obviously bored with his A-level homework and insists on walking around behind me, looking at what I am doing, and criticising. grrrrr. More strong words, and he is gone. For now.  Andy

      A long journey and meeting a fellow blogger  400 mile round trip drive to Warwick, to take The Boy to his South American eco-tour adventure interview. 99% of drivers obey the LAW and vacate the outside lane as the BMW approaches, which was good. Did a cache site in Warwick before lunch, and then head into town for chips and beer. Warwick is gorgeous and very small, hence I had no problem meeting fellow blogger JG who rang me when we were no more than 10 metres away. A lovely chat ensued, discussing family life and the like (and what a pleasure it was, JG), was foreshortened by having to meet The Boy from his interview and getting to meet the eco-tour team. Seems he can go (I should think so for that price!), as long as he and his mother can come come up with the dosh (which, to be honest, he is more likely to come up with than she, cos he really wants it, and he has two years to earn his half, whereas she is just plain rich).  No work done today, obviously, although I sent the Council's new anti discrimination policy to the design team, so they could have a laugh about it's non-corporate appearance (these things are important!), and in the absence of the Boss, and me, no doubt everything went swimmingly at work. The journey back was uneventful, although I was challenged by a Mercedes van/people carrier that was doing 95, towing a trailer, which is actually 45 mph over its official speed limit. I have learnt to respect Mercedes vans as they are very very fast and necessitate doing a ton to outpace them, which is expensive and provocative to those all so rare men and women in blue. Another good day. This is becoming a habit. Andy

      Being out of the office  For four days last week, I had meetings away from Torquay: Taunton, Taunton, Brixham, Exeter, Plymouth. Naturally these were far enough away to make it difficult to get to the office. When I come back, I find over 350 emails are waiting. Having filtered out the spam( oh puhleese, I don't want to look at your crappy porn website, and I really dont think I need a penis extension, from what I'm told anyway), ie most of them, and then being ruthless with the rest, mainly football related (and besides, if we are going to get relegated, then I strangely have lost a little interest), I only have to print out a few, (which I leave in my in-tray for attention later). Plus, I am invited to the management team meeting, in the absence of my boss. Also, there is a divisional meeting with the entire floor present, there is little time to do the usual necessary things like checking out the usual websites (like SimonG.org etc). What was good, though, was that the three new team members were getting on splendidly and achieving things and actually doing the things we should be doing. Which is a great change and lifts a great weight off my mind as my conscience can take some time off. They are keen, knowledgeable and hardworking, which means we chose well when employing them and are likely to score well when we get inspected and when we have to submit status reports to the government. Excellent. Not only that but they tolerated my return, were even welcoming, and asked my advice (in the absence of the boss). I'm in charge, and the crew are excellent. What a lovely feeling.

      What a lovely day  Conference in Plymouth, about building regualtions. Ho-hum, nuff said. Finished at lunchtime (with a lovely lunch and a bottle Becks. £2.75! Cor blimey guvnor). Did the weekly shop at the adjacent Sainsburys and headed of for a convenient geo-cache moment a couple of miles away near Plympton. Found it OK. But what a lovely walk! Through the woods, birds singing their hearts out, a buzzard circling overhead, lovely views, planes landing at Plymouth's mini-airport, and the warmth of the April sun. All in work time. I then sped home up the A38. How come that so many people dont understand the law? A BMW behind you and you get out the way. Simple. Oh no, not this lot. Content to pull out without signalling, or content to drive their effing tractor on a dual carriageway, or content to drive at 75 in the outside lane. I ask you. If I was in charge...... Anyway, when I get home, my lovely partner takes me up the pub and lets me buy her a LARGE Chardonnay. It is lovely apart from the large number of drunken oiks playing on the beach (yup, the pub has a beach. Top place, Teignmouth).  Andy

      Public Speaking  Some weeks ago, my boss and my colleague "volunteered" me to speak at a meeting of SW highway engineers, on the subject of "Shopmobility". It's something I know something about as I chair the local one. However, public speaking is something I really cannot do. I just freeze.  Anyway, I prepared the speech and someone did me a power point thingy, and what with one thing and another, like a couple of meetings over the least few days which prepared me to speak out in public, I had convinced myself I could do it without too much anxiety.  When it came to it, I was last on, following an opionated but witty speaker. I walked up to the front, turned on the Powerpoint thing, had a sip of water, and tried to talk. One: my hands would not stop shaking, even though I told myself I was not nervous. Two, I poured water over the previous speakers jacket, which was on the table; Three: my mouth turned to cotton wool, and I realised I was within seconds of completely drying up. Four: I realised my script was too formal and I should have done my own Powerpoint notes and just ad-libbed around them. Five: I departed from my script, missed loads of stuff out, and forgot to press the mouse for the powerpoint. Anyway, I finished, got applause (relief? Sympathy? Who knows?) and sat down. The bastards made me stay at the front to take questions with the two earlier speakers, and I even got asked a question which I answered well. So. Even if my mind tells me I can do it,my body fails me. What does that remind me of? I think Shakespeare had something to say on this subject. It was a cock up but a great weight has been lifted as I no longer have it to look forward too. A lesson has been learned. A

      Working Hard  Today. I drove to a meeting in Taunton. I drove cos I also had a meeting in Brixham. at 16.30, making the train and bus not an option. Yesterday, I had a meeting in Taunton as well, but then I took the train. Bizarrely, the two meetings were in the same hotel, making me worry that I had got the arrangements mixed up somehow, as the meetings were totally unrelated. Even stranger, a woman from Cornwall had the same two meetings but she had sensibly stayed the night. Oh, how roles in Local Government get mixed up. Other authorities have whole offices dedicated to the two different subjects, but not us (Freight routing and cycle benchmarking, if you must know). Anyway, en route between Taunton and Brixham, I was warned that a Guide dog using colleague had been let down for a lift from Torquay to Brixham for my second meeting so I offered to pick him up. By driving at hugely illegal speeds and fighting my way through the congestion, I picked him up and made the trip for a visit to Brixham Museum to check its accessibility for the disabled. Pretty good, I must say, as long as you stay on the ground floor. Much better than before, when it had steps and all sort of obstacles. After that, the local Wetherspoons for supper, and then home. A 12 hour day, which is a lot for me.  The boy needs more Spanish lessons with his tutor. He seems to have negotiated a payment truce until his mother's cheque arrives, which sounds good to me.

      Kids  Some lovely people made some kind comments today about my bringing up my kids. It happened a long time ago when my then wife decided to take off, even though we had children of 3and a 1/2, and 9 months. OK, I was doing nightshifts, 12 hours at a time and she wasn't working, so we were struggling e.g. 6 months behind with the mortgage. Nonetheless when she decided to go, just before Christmas it was a shock. And she left for another bloke, (neighbour as it happened) She also took 6 months to leave the house, during which I would be up for work at 4am or 4 pm (the shifts rotated between nights and days) and she wouldnt be there (Oh how my mother loved being woken at 4.30 am to come and babysit. What words must have been spoken when the ex eventually rolled in!).  Anyway, it all went through that she was to have the kids. It went to court and I was to pay her vast amounts of maintenance. Things moved on and I too met someone else. I was also doing most of the childcare (it was a long time ago so I dont remember the details. A lot of sick notes I suppose). One weekend, she was actually going to look after the kids while I went away with the new girlfriend. We met up, she said it was inconvenient that weekend. I stood up, in the pub, swore loudly (unheard of!) and said I would have them (since I was doing most of the looking after). She sheepishly agreed and I never paid a penny of the maintenance. Unfortunately, nor did she afterwards, even after becoming stinking rich.  Now it's down to individual transactions between the kids and her when they need something, and often they get something eg, it used to be just trainers, my daughter has got driving lessons (although the dipstick failed her test) and the boy has got the promise of an "educational" 16 week holiday in the Andes. He even got the promise of a £100 worth of Spanish lessons towards his A level tonight. It's on her terms, not theirs, or mine, but at least (although, note the word "promise") it is coming through now. My estimate, is that what with selling the house after the divorce, giving her 10K to set herself up, and her not paying what the Child Support Agency (God bless them) said she should, she must owe me £80,000. Which she has got, thanks to her husband. Thank goodness for Spanish lessons! Screwed like that, you are screwed for life. However. We speak to her. I am proud of my children (proud enough to lend my lovely daughter yet another tenner cos her dole cheque hasn't come through, (get your bloody boyfriend to get a job, that would help!) and because it would be inconvenient to get her mother to give her a tenner cos her mother is in London, and we aren't, and send the boy off to another private Spanish lesson tonight, even though he has irritated me to pieces tonight  Nuff said. Kids are good, but they are a trial if you try it on your own.  A

      Qualifications, oh, and children  Looking through a previously unseen magazine today, I read a short article and realised it was a blurb for doing an M.Sc in Inclusive Environments (or summat) in 6 easy modules at Reading University. It looked ideal for where my so-called career is going and would get the Council loads of ticks for being "good".  I mentioned it to my boss and he immediately fancied it too. I rang them up, got the cost (£1000 per module thanks very much) and 5 years to do it. Now I have to persuade "Human Resources" that it is a good thing to do so they will pay for it. Suddenly I have a purpose! I am now at meetings elsewhere for 4 days in a row so I won't be able to confirm I can do it, but hey, me, with an M.SC? What's going on? On another subject, the boy is planning to go to South America and has been persuaded by his mother to go for a 16 week escorted tour in his "gap year", which wont be until 2005-2006. She has promised to pay half and he must earn the rest. The organisers have called him for interview next week (oh how the moneyed classes live). In Warwick. And how do you get to Warwick from Devon? He discussed this with his mum who seemed to be saying he should take 3 days off school so he could catch the train to London, have her take him up there, then come back on the 3rd day. Right. While he is about to start his 1st year A-level exams. I dont think so. I said I would take him if necessary, but I am not allowed to talk directly to her, he says, in case I have a go at her for messing about etc. which, OK, I have done recently, but I dont normally and often have long chats trying to squeeze some money out of her to help bring up the kids. Nowadays, they do that sort of negotiation themselves. However, being forbidden by the boy to speak to his mother doent prevent me, and yes I am now driving him to Warwick. I'm paying, too. I knew that would happen. Never pays a penny if she can help it, that woman. That's how she gets to be rich and I get to be poor. Men bringing up kids? It's not right. I've been doing it for 16 years and I'm still rubbish at it. A

      Being odd  Carrying on the theme of having access to the MG, I took the opportunity of visiting a cache on Dartmoor today. A long walk up a road ensued. Eventually I came across some walkers in front of me who were going slowly. I had my hood up because it was raining. The man in front turned round and shouted at me. "What?" He shouted again. "Sorry?". Turns out he was shouting at someone behind me. God knows where they came from. Having a pee probably. Anyway, I felt a dick for talking (shouting) to someone who wasn't speaking to me. Then I looked for the cache which was by the path, keeping a lookout for other walkers because looking for a cache on your own in the middle of Dartmoor can look "odd", or even "decidedly fruitcake". The shouting people eventually came along so I walked on, until they were past the site and then I ambled back, whistling innocently. Of course, they dithered and dithered, and so did the people behind, who also seemed to have bladder problems involving a sly pee in the nearby gorse. Anyway, I found it, without falling in the river. Came home, did the washing up which I had surprisingly missed when I left the kids there earlier, and welcomed M off the train, which is only 2 minutes walk away. Nice to have her back, nice to see the back of my daughter who has spent the whole weekend here, and the boy has gone to work, making hygienic the plates of those poor souls who eat the "food" in the restaurant in which he works. At least the plates are clean when they have their food put on them. A

      Magic Moments  M is away this weekend (visiting Southend Pier or something) so I have free access to her yummy MG. I took the opportunity to put the top down and cruise at dangerous speeds to Exeter to do a little trivial shopping. On the way I did a lovely cache on Great Haldon. Anyway, on the way back, I was stuck behind this rather slow car and it was getting a little frustrating. Then, as we approached Teignmouth, something magical happened. If you know Teignmouth, you approach it from the Haldon hills like coming down in an aeroplane. There it is, laid out before you: the town, the sea, the port, the estuary. With the sun out, and the roof down in the car, it was gorgeous, with the blue sea glistening in the distance. Then, with no warning, Jonathan Ross played "Pretty Vacant" by The Sex Pistols*. Wallop. Volume up (and the MG packs a good stereo), the car in front evaporates in the blink of an eye, and there I was in heaven. Fantastic. Everything was right with the world. I do live in a nice place.

      Teenage Boys  Exhibit One: Interviews held over the last few days have enabled us to employ an 18 year old lad as a technician, in preference to the recently qualified degree holders who had also been interviewed, because he was willing, clever, had the right experience, and, unbelievably had been working VOLUNTARILY at a charitable travel information service for FOUR years. We found this remarkable and like him very much. Also, he is less likely to move on as some of the more ambitious degree holders might want to do. OK I havent interviewed many people before but he's the third person i have been involved in interviewing and the first two are very successful (even brilliant) so far, doing all the stuff that we have been unable to do because of lack of people like them. Exhibit two:  Young Viscount Hutton, ie my boy, worrying about doing 5 A levels and what if he fails them. He works so hard but is unconvinced of his own abilities. Also worrying about whether his long term ambition to go to South America will come off, and whether his long departed mother will honour her promise to help him go on a 16 week escorted tour to said continent in 2006 (her suggestion), with 50% coming from his "gap year" earnings and 50 % from her. The tour she suggests is very costly, but I am sure it will be worth it. Why she has to put conditions on his dream is beyond me. I have brought him up, she merely has buckets of money from her 2nd marriage which she has failed so far to use on my (oh, and her) children. (I think he may come to the conclusion he may do it under his own steam, without having to satisfy her conditions) . Anyway, it seems to me that teenage boys can be very lovely. No doubt an iffy position to hold these days, but that's what I find as a  parent and employer (of sorts). A

      On the subject of Twinning  The very first post-war effort by two European cities to join hands in friendship dates back to 1947 when Bristol Council sent five 'leading citizens' on a goodwill mission to Hanover. On their return home, the Bristolians duly resolved to start sending food to Germany while Hanover, eager to reciprocate in some way, decided to send back music. A choir of students went to perform in Bristol the following year.  The idea spread quickly in the years that followed. It was thought that if people of different nations got to know and understand each other on a personal level by meeting in their normal environments, even their private homes, then the horrors of war would never be repeated. Also, if one city ever needed help or advice it could be more easily and unbureaucratically given by another city than, for example, by national aid programmes.  Oxford and Bonn were next in tying the knot, Reading and Dusseldorf followed suit, and the first German-French twinning, between Montbeliard and Ludwigsburg, came about in 1950. 1951 saw the establishment of the Council of European Municipalities hoping to promote a European spirit at grass roots level, encouraging the idea that Europe needed to unite in order to rebuild. Above all, it recognized the autonomy of--and democratic s tructures within--local government as the base of any democratic state and as a means actively to rule out the possibility of another dictatorship. Local government was to act as a mediator between people and national government, with a view to influencing national foreign policy over time.  I lifted some (well, all) of the above from the internet but i think it shows the ideals which set off twinning. It might not be so relevant now, but I think the idea of Europeans talking to each other (and people from other continents, where such arrangements occur) can only be a good thing. Most municipal reps stay in their counterparts' houses and enjoy their counterparts' hospitality, at each others expense. What's a very few quid of Council tax payers money (in the scheme of things) compared to happy relationships with our fellow humans from other countries? All strength to its arm, that's what I say. I am all for people of different cultures talking to each other.  This in response to Mr Thirst ( stay cool, my old friend) I have no responsibility for Twinning. My employing council is twinned to Hellevoetsluis, Hamelin and probably somewhere else. It's one of those things where, if you don't do it, or don't know much about it, it seems silly. But I think twinning is good. However, I have doubts about people having to wear hats on these occasions, as I am told that is what is expected. It seems wrong to me. My one twinning occasion did not not involve hats but it did involve drinking lots of (privately funded) whisky and watching telly in the back of a BMW 775 (which is as big as a space ship).

      Employing People Interviews today and tomorrow for our new boy/girl/peasant. 2 of the three were really good and I'd be happy to take them on tomorrow. Then a fly in the ointment: a chap with a disability who had applied was not given an interview. Apparently, he should have been given an interview if he had fulfilled the "person specification", but not the "job specification" ie if he was a human being (obv) but his qualifications were irrelevant. We had actually gone to Personnel and asked them if we should interview him, but were advised no. Now they say we should have because he mentioned his lack of interview to the job centre and they told the council and now the bugs in Personnel say it might threaten our 2 star rating with the government (whatever that is). Strikes me as a poor and patronising way to get disabled applicants an interview. So I phoned him up, told him we had misapplied the policy, and would he like an interview? Unsurprisingly the poor sod said no thanks.  Now I work with disabled people and I aint got no axe to grind here, but I really dont know anyone who would support a policy of interviewing someone if there are better qualified candidates.  To  prove me wrong, M and her boss are interviewing for designers at the same time. They were told to interview a very overqualified guy with one leg. Turns out he might be the very person they were looking for, and wouldnt have had the interview without the policy. I'm a git, but aint that always the way?  A

      Bollox Man Utd 1 Leicester City 0 Damn. Rubbish. We should have stayed in and not gone to the pub to see it. Oh well, geocaching yesterday gave me an evil ache today, but that shows my age. "Bleedin' Hill" in Worcestershire is a very tall place and I ache lots. 5 people have visited my cache since Saturday when I left it. Shopmobility Committee hit me today, even though I had forgotten to send out the minutes cos of being away and then injured. We met anyway and it was implied that it was some sort of  sexual injury that had got me incapacitated. Not true. As if. It was the fall off the roof that did the damage. Plus having a life. Interviews tomorrow. For a new tea boy (or Monitoring Officer as we call it). Me and J are doing them. How do you choose between 6 equally eager young people? I hope the new bug is OK. J is taking over and I see my career here as nearly over. J is good, clever, and well organised. Good, because I am tired.  I am exhausted A

      What a productive weekend. Left first cache on the Teign estuary on Saturday. I think my sister thought I was a bit mad. On Sunday, M and I drove to Evesham in the MG, leaving the boy to fend for himself. Took 2 hours, which I thought was good, but M said it was illegal. Had a fun party in rich friends' manor house. Today we went caching on Bredon Hill, which I presume is really called "Bleedin'" Hill cos it is very high. They all gave up but I found it. Came down again, and I didnt slip or fall or anything which was pretty good, for me. Then we went to the pub again and I drove back in 2 hours which, again I thought was pretty good. Two illegal things happened: we were overtaken by a Metro when I wasn't concentrating and everyone knows they are not allowed in the outside lane; and there was a horsebox in the middle lane of the M5 which is totally against the law as they are banned from the roads between 6am and 12 midnight and are NEVER allowed beyond the inside lane. Oh, and although we left the boy here on his own, there are few signs of him having been here. Also the police were taking a serious interest in the scallies next door. I do hope the two are not connected.  A

      Complete Idiot, or Living it like Rod Hull and Emu  Next door has scaffolding up so they can do the roof. Because of the shape of the houses, some of the scaffolding is in my garden, with the walkway just outside the 2nd floor window of Hutton Towers. After the men had gone home last night, I decided it would be a good idea to use the scaffolding to clamber up the tiles of my own roof to clean a sash window on the 3rd floor that is otherwise impossible to clean. After all, the scaffolding walkway was nearly next to my roof.  So I stagger up the slates carrying a bucket of water and clean the window, throwing the excess water at the window (and all over the slates). Too late I realised I had made the slates all wet and slippery. Facing the inevitable, I disappeared from the view of those at the window and slipped and fell down the roof and onto the scaffolding walkway, luckily overshooting the gutter and the large gap. All M, the boy, and his mate heard was a crash. Apparently the boys turned white. They rushed out the bedroom and down 3 floors to the cellar and the garden door, expecting to find a body spreadeagled on the concrete. In the meantime, the idiot on the roof got up, brushed himself down, and pretended it was all planned. 30 feet below three anxious faces peered up. Having realised that I had probably hurt myself (there was blood on my shirt), I climbed back in to be met by an amazed, if relieved, audience.  Wounds: a gouged wrist, a grazed elbow, a gashed and bruised thigh, a bruised calf, and a backache. Reward: 2 pints of Directors Result: From M's reaction, I think she loves me as well as thinking she lives with an idiot.  And a clean window  A

      Back  So. We are returned from Morocco. Everything went with seamless ease from getting the metro from Malaga airport to the city centre, to finding the port, getting the ship to Melilla, finding an hotel, crossing the border (a 3rd world hell for those Moroccans trying to make a living by trading across the border). Anyway. We hired a car in Morocco (£300 cash deposit thank you very much) and drove to Fes, through amazing scenery, almost alpine and very green. We got to the new town, and for a second hesitated. Long enough for a man to get in the car to offer to find us a hotel. Which he did, and very fine it was too. He also found us the secret place (not signed) where you can buy beer and wine. What a star. A visit to the medina found us very lost (which is normal) but perseverance got us safely back. In the morning we headed south in the fog and rain. The suburbs of Fes are amazingly French. We could have been in France, not Africa. Did a cache, and then went into the Atlas mountains (via a ski resort that could have been in France to), Saw lots of monkeys in the trees and on the road. Then we crossed the Middle Atlas and hit the desert. People (Berber tribespeople)everywhere, standing, squatting, waiting for a lift, shepherding, all in this parched desert with few signs of habitation. A most bizarre place. I recommend the drive from Ifrane to Missour and then north to Guercif for the sheer beauty of the mountains and desert. Anyway, we returned to Melilla (getting screwed for money exchange by a Spanish change establishment) Melilla is lovely but very isolated. Returned to Malaga overnight. Gorgeous city. A quick trip to Torremolinos proved that this is still a place to avoid if you dont like tower blocks by the sea. In the afternoon, we went geo-caching up at the castle which was successful and took us places we would never have been otherwise. In the evening we came across the Palm Sunday "La Pasion de Malaga" procession which was very bizarre: hundreds of people in robes and pointy hats with holes cut for eyeholes. Quite sinister. This morning, I discovered the way to get a teenager out of bed is to show them the wriggling cockroach on its back, on the floor of his hotel room. Works wonders! A brilliant trip. No rows with the boy. A great adventure. Looking forward to seeing M when she gets back from NY  Andy

      The visit, shopping, caching and buying art.  Having accommodated the ex last night, and finding sleeping places for the Girl and her daughter too, so that my children slept under the same roof as their mother and me for the first time in a very long time (once very 10 years or so is enough), we bade farewell to the ex in her long drive in her Chelsea Tractor back to London (via the new pad in Dorset, which I feel is a trifle too close). It was then my duty to take Boy, Girl and Girl's Daughter to Matalan and Tesco, where boy got a new pair of jeans, Girl did her weekly shop, and I brought a new bin from Matalan which looks expensive, but wasn't. Dropped Girl and shopping (and Girl's Daughter) off and headed with M to Exeter. Starngely, the skateboard shop was shut on a bank holiday, so dumped Boy at station for journey home to do REVISION. Found THREE caches in Topsham and Exmouth although the weather was complete pants and M had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the car. I need her ferreting skills for the final search though. Lunch at the Passage House in Topsham (I say lunch, but we had already had a picnic, prepared by M, and it was past 3 by the time we stopped for BEER). On return to the great Metropolis of Teignmouth, I recall the great Teignmouth International Arts Festival, being held at the Community College's new Arts Centre, and to which M has expressed a desire to attend. Wonderful. We focus independently on three works by the same artist but smile sadly when we see the prices. The Artist appears to be popular already. However I do spot one by another artist which I covet. It is now paid for ("Oh, I haven't got my cheque book. Have you got yours, dear? You have? How fortunate") and can be collected on Saturday. I never ever thought I'd buy pictures (What use are they?) but it gives me a real glow. I've no idea if it is any "good", but it looks good to me and M which I suppose is what is important.

      Picture This  It is Sunday lunch. We are at the pub and have had to come inside because of the showers. This is an embarassment as people who live here tend not to sit outside because that is for the grockles. The pub is not exactly trendy or tasteful. In fact it is distinctly rough. We knew this but some strange charm has dragged us back. Around the table are myself, LadyH, The Girl, The Girl's Daughter, and umm, My Ex(The Girl's mother), and her daughter (ie The Girl's half sister). Oh, and their dog, which is of some strange and expensive breed with straggly hair and big feet and who can't sit still. A guy is on the PA doing reggae covers, which is all very well except we weren't expecting any entertainment and conversation becomes impossible, especially with the dog and the Girl's Daughter being extremely energetic. We are accommodating the Girl's Mother tonight, which is a trifle difficult (we got divorced 16 years ago). At least my other ex (of 10 years) isn't around. Yet. She doesn't live very far away. Oooh the thought: cats in a sack? Or universal condemnation of my good self?. I suspect the latter.   Yesterday, LadyH and I went to Bideford by train and bus. An excellent day was had by all and the public transport was superb. Bideford appears to have more pubs than people, so well worth a visit, if you like that sort of thing.  A

      Dead Men Walking  Today is the day where I go to attend the disabled people's Access Meeting, where a group of people bang on about the council, and a particular street in Torquay where there is a people/traffic conflict and about any other subject under the sun that they banged on about the previous month. Fortunately, the chief whinger/gossip-monger/exagerator/take-things-out-of-all-context-and-proportion person was not there so we were all happy. I give a lift to a wheel chair user to these meetings, and have to help her in and out of her chair, and the car. Her husband is dying of cancer and hasn't got long to live. I mentioned him here some time ago.  When I got her back to her house, he was there at the door waiting to let her back in. He is no longer capable of of lifting or helping and spends most his time asleep and avoiding eating. He has never looked well, but now he looks like a tall hunched skeleton. What do you say to someone like that? Apart from "Hi, Chris, see you soon" in a chirpy voice? His wife, the one in the wheelchair (stroke victim), seems to be taking it well, although how she'll cope without her husband/carer I dont know. I think she has good family and friends around her. A friend of mine suggested that clean sheets and a vase of freesias were the best thing to have in that situation. I think he is right. I hope Chris has them. The MacMillan nurses will do their wonderful work.  On the way home we stopped at the Coombe Cellars pub on the Teign estuary. Obviously it is a terrible thing to have to sit out on the terrace, looking west up the river towards Dartmoor, with a pint of BEER, knowing there's no rush to get home because the boy is away. We got talking to a retired couple from somewhere near Chesterfield. They must have been in their '70s but were obviously fit and healthy and loving their freedom. The husband had recently fallen 14 feet from a ladder and landed on his back on concrete. Fearing the worst for his spine, he realised he hadn't broken a thing, although his insides were a little messed up. He just finds tennis a bit difficult at the moment. What a lucky man! I'd like to have a retirement like that. Chris won't though.  Andy

      The madness of people  1 Daphne used to live next door. She was taken away to an old people's home 3 or 4 years ago. We haven't seen her since. However, her phone still rings occasionally(we can hear it through the wall). Who rings her that doesnt know where she is? And who pays the line rental?  2 Dorothy used to live the other side. Then she died. The council obviously have some influence on the house as some scallies now live there. The younger children, aged 6 or 7, seem to spend an inordinate amount of time out in the very small back garden, which has no plants or flowers, hitting bricks with hammers and wrenches. I dunno.  3 The Boy came in, all fired up about going to see his mum in London. No clue as to why this has suddenly come on, because he has not discussed it before, except he probably wants her to buy him something. Train arranged, tickets to be purchased tomorrow (at my expense, obv), persuade a friend to cover for his Saturday washing up job, all sounds iffy to me. It's good that he wants to see her.  4 There was once a guy at work, who could sink two bottles of wine, or 8 scotches, at lunchtime. He left.  5 There was a mate of mine at work, who lost his mum and his dad, and took to drink. He took more and more time off work and went completely off his tree. When he was hospitalised, I had to clear his house and assist in the fumigation(literally) of the ruins and cleared out more gin bottles than you could shake a stick at. This included the bottles he had left in his desk and his lap top case. Obviously, his suffering was far more complicated than I can describe here. Anyway, his house debugged, he came out of hospital, gave most of his possessions away, never came back to work, and has now sold up and has moved to Sheffield, where he came from originally. He is dry, fit and healthy (and well rid of me no doubt).  6 As a weekend activity, M and I are going by train and bus to Bideford on Saturday, a place she has not visited before. We may stay the night. (Burglars note: The Boy is away too)  A

      Other People's Children  The boy is determined on a holiday in Turkey with his friend Megan next month. He has been frustrated by age restrictions by the travel agents (they are 17 and 16), but amazingly, we worked out a flight plus holiday package of our own where only parental consent was required. Spanner in the works comes from the Megan's mum who doesnt want her daughter going to Turkey. Alternative destinations are at an inflated price, or to a destination the Boy doesn't want to go to ie any other Mediterranean destination. I suggest they try alternatives acceptable to Megan's mum, but the Boy doesn't want to know. I hope they will reach a compromise but at 17, this seems diificult to do for the Boy. We spent the evening in grumpy discussion as to how to get his hols off the ground. None of the suggested compromise appears acceptable to the Boy. Poor old M. The Boy is not her child, and in fact he has had to deal with his real mother, who was there until he was about 15 months (we still see her) and my former partner(who still calls herself "mum". She left 5 years ago). M finds it very hard to deal with his teenage attitude, having had no experience herself, and he not being her child. I find it hard enough myself. Anyway, M is tearful tonight, and I can understand her frustration. She can't say too much in an angry way, and she finds she blocks her emotions off, which is Not A Good Thing. It will be sorted, and soon. It's only a boy's holiday for god's/invisible friend's, sake A

      Crossing the Border  I was invited yesterday, by our local Train Company, to a meeting in St Austell, where they would be discussing a bid to get money to rebuild St Austell Station. This was because I am trying to get money to refurbish Torquay Station, which is horridly boarded up, and the guy at the train company thought it would give me a good view on how complicated you can make the process. Anyway, I live right by the station, which happens to be on the same line as St Austell, and with one change, has a frequent service between the two. Needless to say, the railwayman insisted on going by car, and so passport in hand, I got a lift to Cornwall.  A smooth ride down, we checked out the station (where, of course, he gets to park for free), and headed for the meeting, which was very interesting. I fear I have bitten off something which, if not larger than I can chew, is at least going to be very complicated. No matter. On the way back, we visited Liskeard Station, which is also being rebuilt, for lunch (a scrummy fried egg sandwich), which was free for me, and which he will claim expenses for. We drove through parts of Cornwall I had never seen (usually by-passed on the way to the far west)and very nice it was too. All in all, a lovely day, made all the better for a lift back to lovely Teignmouth, which although very hazy today, is warm enough for the boy to come back to get his swimming stuff, so him and his mates can go jumping off the quay. Which is fun. Apparently A

      Internet Wizard  I spent today working at something that has been worrying me for a long time: the forthcoming deadline for the Council's new website to go "live". I appear to have been delegated to upload our section's stuff, and as I had had one training session, the contents of which I had already forgotten, and I didn't know where to find half the stuff required, I was becoming a little panic stricken, especially as my PC appeared to be missing some vital software.  Anyway, I spent the day loading documents, filling in tree structures, loading pictures and maps, having .pdfs formatted, creating links, editing old text. It all seemed so easy. Except it wasn't and I didn't do any of it. It is lucky my friend Juan was there to do it all, while I watched, and fetched stuff off my PC I thought needed to go there.   I also asked my new colleague Nellington for a PDF about Business Travel Plans. She found it but it was laid out wrongly (for four sides of folded A3, so the pages were in the wrong order for my requirements). I asked her to ring LadyH, who just happened to be the one who had PDF'd it in the first place. Within about a minute, the reformatted PDF appeared, as if by magic, on email, all ready for putting on the website.  Calling LadyH to comment on her rapid performance, I wondered aloud, that perhaps doing Graphic Design wasn't as difficult as she made out when making excuses as to why stuff I'd asked her for took such a long time. I think I am in trouble. She has just got in. Lucky there are some new flowers and supper already prepared. A

      All set today to do the "Topsham Ten pub crawl" geocache challenge, in the absence of M who is away at the NEC at the "Good Houses" exhibition, or somesuch. Phone call from The Girl reveals an interest in being away from the flat for the day (in which never going out boyfriend intends to watch the Grand Prix). "OK, be ready to catch the train in 10 minutes" leads to a record getting dressed and the baby too and we meet at the station, on the first day of summer train services (we don;t have Sunday am trains in the winter). Glorious views of the sea and makes me realise that every day can be like a holiday here in Devon. I am not used to it after 15 years. We get to Topsham and start the challenge, beginning at "The Bridge Inn", the only pub in the World that the Queen has visited. This was the correct place to start, as it happens as it is a little isolated from the rest. Calling at the next nine, mostly closed, as it is Sunday, we establish our co-ordinates for the cache, only to find them apparently over the River Exe, with no bridge. So a "no find" there, then. My daughter, I presume, thinks I am a loony (she has seen me set a cache, but never find one). However, a pleasant lunch was had, (although baby was a little troublesome, to say the least) at the Passage House Inn in Topsham. The Girl would like to live in Topsham (wouldn't we all?) but I suspect she will have to get a job or find a rich benefactor, just like her mother did (benefactor, not job, obviously). Little M has discovered running, which is amusing, but very troubling on station platforms and involves her and a trusty adult in lots of exercise, because the direction is entirely unpredictable. The journey back was uneventful, but, as I said before, the views of the sea, sky, cliffs and beaches are unbelievable. One day, I will move back to an inland residence, and all this will just be a happy memory. A

      Noises  Last night I tried to add photos and stuff and got really frustrated when it didn't work, so none of that nonsense tonight. Instead, I will relate the tale of the tatty fireplace, which is situated in this self-same room. It's been sanded and generally attacked until the original wood now shows through, after teenage painting experiments had turned it yellow. Teenagers' experiments, more exactly. Now it has been sanded, it needs a couple of pine panels to disguise the horrid 1960s hardboard panelling which was used to make it smaller (god/invisible friend knows what's behind that panelling). Fortunately, a helpful neighbour left some unused skirting board by the bins for the garbologists (©Bill Long, Torquay Council Refuse Collector, retd.) to collect. I rescued it, cut it to suitable lengths, ("Stop bleedin' sawin', you're as bad as the neighbours, it's nearly 11 o'clock" interjected the lovely Lady H, not born in Essex, but one might think so). Obviously, the new panels need nailing into place. Bang, bang, bang. Lady H is now up in arms: "stop it, you don't know how much that is like the neighbours, banging at this time of night". The new panels are lying peacefully by the fireplace, awaiting the new morn for their affixation. We do have weird neighbours. I recall helping them move in. It was midnight, as if they were fleeing from some enemy. Since then we have had a stolen car abandoned by them in the street, visits from the police, rows at 1am, stereos turned up full on a sunny afternoon in the garden, plus various other minor offences to be taken into account m'lud. I can see why M is peed off with my noise. She got quite grumpy, and I assured her I wouldn't maon about that in my blog, ahem. I can also see she looks funny in earplugs and eyemask too, when she is hiding from neighbournoise. Now she is having a lovely scented bath with candles, which is very girly. I turned down the opportunity to follow her in the bath (although I may go and barge in). Next door are due to start any second. It was probably a good thing I didn't fix the fireplace.

      Frustration and Joy  I have just spent hours trying to scan one photograph. I can see it on my screen, but can I save it as anything but a useless .ini file? No. M can't do it either. It's all rubbish this software and very frustrating. I am thinking of taking up the abacus and using the Royal Mail instead. Additionally, I blogged and it got lost, despite pressing all these new buttons that blogspot have introduced to upset people. Hence this is blog the second, abbreviated.  However, my daughter, the one who lives in a flat with the boyfriend who doesn't go out, the daughter who has caused me so much grief, the mother of my lovely grand daughter, did someting secret today, and didnt own up until it was over...    She took her driving test.   For the second time.        She passed  Good girl.

      An Evening Out  The Access Meeting in Torbay has an occasional night out to test pubs and restaurants for their accessibility for disabled people. I attend as a council officer, who is not disabled, (well OK i feel pretty bad sometimes with depression and other stuff, like IBS, but not disabled).  Tonight we returned to a pub in Babbacombe which has apparently made some improvements since our last visit,with the intention of awarding them a certificate if they had done what they said they would do. Unfortunately, they hadn't. No large print menus, no tactile toilet signs. The access is level though,and they had made a small alteration in the disabled loo, and the standard of service was good and considerate (that's 90% of the battle). Oh yes, the spanish waitress scared us all when no-one claimed a "sizzling steak". She was very frightening. I'm glad my omelette was OK cos I don't think I would have wanted to complain to her) I don't think they deserve a certificate yet because there are lots of things not yet done. How do you deal with someone who announces (quietly, through her brother) that her husband will be dead in two months through cancer. That man is her chief carer and in my friend's life is irreplaceble. She has to use a wheelchair and is completely incapacitated on her left side. He never comes out with us but her brother and children do. They all seem resigned to it, but they left early to be with him. What a rotten world. No. That's how it is and all the best to them for coping. Brave people. A

      A Busy Day  First thing this morning, the bigwigs from the Government Office of the South West pay us a visit to discuss the council's Local Transport Plan. Apparently we are the first to show them our draft Annual Progress Report for this year and we pressed all the right buttons, so that's half the battle in winning lots of transport funds for next year. Then on to our Shopmobility committee which I chaired with my normal quickfire skill and had it wrapped up in three quarters of an hour. Back in the office I spent far too long in a certain chatroom, where certain insinuations were made about my clandestine meeting with a certain other chattee. The threatened duel fortunately failed to materialise. (Incidentally, I did once strike up a relationship with a woman I met on the internet, but it was only for a weekend, and it was through a common football interest, strangely). Then, it was to a community meeting with a large nimby contingent. Amazing how much anger can be expressed by people who are ignorant and suspicious, and how the normal rules of politeness can go flying out the window. Leaving there knackered, I met M and we left for home about 7. The day not being over, it is dole tuesday and the fortnightly visit to Tescos with H and the Puke Monkey (who didnt fail to live up to her name). Having fed the boy some frozen rubbish, we drove the 6 miles to Tesco. Finally (or so I thought), Microwave supper in a few minutes.Oh no, it's an oven job, so I don't eat until 10 which is late for me. After a laugh with Gordon Ramsay and a restaurant in Esher (a place not too far from where I was brought up in my teenage years) I am now blogging at nearly 1130. Unfortunately, I am also assisting with General Studies A Level revision,(exam tomorrow) which involves thinking and stuff cos the boy is having trouble with the maths. Oh well. Tomorrow is another day A I dont think I'll need too large a vodka to get me to sleep tonight

      Strange Creatures  Last year, M and I went camping at Symonds Yat, a beauty spot on the river Wye, near Ross on Wye (strangely). The popular side was fully occupied so we drove a long way round and found a caravan site which did camping. Well, the sign said they did but the bloke at the entrance seemed quite surprised when we asked to camp, and sent us to the corner of a distant field. Lots of other campers turned up too, so perhaps that man at the gate had a very short memory. In the morning, early, I walked along the river looking for a suitable private place for a swim. After 20 minutes, the path came to a stiop at some houses, so I turned back, noticing a goat and a pig in an enclosure. Walking on, I turned around to see the goat following me. No amount of persuasion could make it stay in its' little home. It followed and followed, past the camp site. I thought I lost it and had my swim, only to see it eyeing up my clothes for a quick chew. Quickly leaving the water, I went back to the campsite, where I spotted it's friend, Pig, eating the grass by the loos. Not wanting to be blamed for this demonstration of porcine and goatish independence, I scuttled back to the tent, where I alerted M to the prescence of Goat and Pig. Obviously, when she went to check, she found no trace of such animals, therefore believing me to be a fantastical delusionist. Weeks later, I was walking from work to the station, when I came across some students waiting at a bus stop. They were being molested by a small crow. Shortly thereafter, as I stood in merriment, watching their distress, a person called and whistled the crow, which then returned to its' owner. This weekend, M heard what she thought was a duck in the street outside. On closer investigation, she found the cat, Monty, stairing intently at a squirrel he had trapped in a neighbour's porch. Having removed Monty, the squirrel/duck was induced to high tail it for the nearest tree. Funny things, Animals

      The World Seine Boat Championships  To the beach today. It's only 300 metres but we never go, just like when you live near London you never go to the theatre etc. Why would any normally sensible adult human want to go and sit in a crowded, hot place to be uncomfortable and get covered in sand? Anyway we did. In the company of H and little M. I took LM to the water's edge and then had to decide either to let go of her, cos I still had my shoes on, or hold her back. There was a distinct possibility if I let her go that she wouldn't stop, as the water was warm, and she'd end up in France. Fortunately I was rescued by more sensible people, ie M and Little M's mum, H, who took on the task of letting LM paddle, get covered in sand, eat sand, rub sand in, apply sun tan lotion and sand, throw sand, etc etc. My job was to buy ice cream and bucket and spade (and I was allowed one drink of BEER). It was so rewarding to see the two favourite women in my life (ie my daughter and my partner) play with Little M and get on so well together. Later, after showers and baths, H and LM went home. I sat enjoying the sunshine in the garden until next door's put some dreadful technodrumandbassrubbishbollox on, outside. Outside!?! B*stards. I had words. Strangely, it kept playing even after they went indoors. Later, during snooze, H and LM turned up again. Presumably LM's father decided that H had showed too much independence by going out for the afternoon and so they had a row. Now H and Little M are staying with us for the evening, night etc.  Little M is really becoming her own person and happily watched Lion King (intermittently) while her mum was on the phone to her mate. At least H got a break, which I presume her boyfriend doesn't allow her. Oh, and the World Seine Boat Championships? It's like powerboat racing. Without the power. No noise. They're a long way away. And when they say "world", it's really a Teignmouth thing.

      The pub on the beach  Living by the sea, we have the wonderful facility of having a couple of pubs on the back beach, which face west up the estuary towards the sun setting over Dartmoor. Wow, you may think. Unfortunately, the people who inhabit the tables outside seem to be of the most freakish kind. They look weird, mostly a very unhealthy look, a diet of chips and McDonalds; most have spent all day in the pub and are therefore not at their best, especially when it comes to looking after the numerous small children they have acquired. Some really ineffective parenting. Its going to be a vicious circle with their kids; the conversation is not of the most entertaining kind, involving swearing, and talk of violent incidents ("I 'it 'er, an' then she....." etc). There was even a Status Quo in Australia t-shirt. Oh, and a woman with a pitch black mullet. And it was a genuine mullet. Oh please. The staff are incredibly miserable, until suddenly they surprise you with a smile. 5 minutes later you find they have finished their shift. Ah, that's why. Sad.  Leicester City are playing Arsenal tomorrow in their last game before division one. I am thinking we will lose 6-0. This will encourage a freakish Leicester victory in reality before we go down. Perhaps.   A

      Cats, and the presents they bring  I was cleaning the kitchen floor this evening (having given the servants the evening off) as an alternative to going to the barbers. Both barber shops are shut on thursdays, which is dreadfully annoying. The kitchen floor is covered in very attractive white lino (with a few small black squares in a symmetrical pattern)which has the fatal drawback of always looking filthy. This is only mitigated by the fact that it was cheap because the teenage checkout assistant charged us by length and not square meterage (and we weren't telling him). Cleaning the floor reminded me of what a filthy eater the kitten is. She drags her food all over the floor, where bits of "meat" set hard and have to be vigorously scrubbed off. Over the years, cats have brought me many presents. Once, I was given half a squirrel. More recently we have been given a goldfish (dead, whole), a rat (dead, whole), various mice (dead, whole; dead, two pieces; alive, whole), and various birds, mostly live. Christmas day saw the presentation of of a whole dead mouse which was very festive. As they don't tend to speak English, I thought this, in particular, showed a great understanding of the seasonal spirit. It were lovely, with the sprouts and stuffing etc

      Giving Up Smoking  M has been gently chiding me about smoking for some time, as has the boy. The girl smokes too, but not with the daughter in the room. My friend has given up with the aid of numerous nicotine minty things (OK, 5 days given up which hardly counts). It seemed a good idea last night that I should give it a go, as it is a pretty obnoxious habit, especially for other people. Long ago, I smoked at work (when the phone rang, with a coffee, when a lorry got back, blah blah ie all the time). In my present job, I only smoke at lunchtime, as I can't be arsed to go down 4 floors to stand outside the back door, and in the evening when the lager flows.  Recently I have taken up buying "duty free" (ahem) rolling tobacco which means I smoke even less as I can't just pull a fag from the packet anymore: I have to stop and make one. After discussions last night, during which I suggested I would try to give up, I have had only one rolly since yesterday. It is becoming very tempting to light one up as Blogspot.com have promised easy photos on a blog, while making it impossible to do any such thing. Such stress means I might have to take up smoking. Damn (in an Eminem stylee)

      The Middle Ages  I am currently reading a book about the English Language. It goes into immense detail about how our language has changed over the centuries. In 800 the writen language looked like German, with verbs starting with ge- and ending in -an, and with odd looking letters, which pressing alt+numeric keypad doesn't help. I think it would help if the pronounciation was made clearer, but of course they didn't have tape recorders or digital video cameras in those days. Anyway, during Old English, the Vikings arrived. Setting up their Smørgasbord shops and generally messing about with AEnglish as it then was. they had a massive and unusual influence on the construction of English eg word order, pronouns etc which dont change very easily. Words change but not grammar. The verb at the end of a sentence try putting!  The Normans just brought a load of unnecessary words about cooked food and stuff, mostly for the upper classes. The rest of us stuck with anglo-saxon.  The other middle ages concerns my first direct acknowledgement in general coversation at work, that I have a grand daughter, as in, "the other day, my grandaughter did .......", in front of the Young People at work. Got the zip up cardy fleece, the Beemer, the gadgets, the increasing grumpiness (I was told off by M for grumpiness this morning), I even got the phone call from the little one's mum (still not admitting the "grand daughter")because my voice would stop the Little One's whinging. It worked, apparently. I'm not a grandfather, I'm not midddle aged, I'm not 45. I'm 12. Soddit.

      Racism, Anti immigrant rubbish, and no-one seems to fight back  Recently, our local newspaper has been running letters from a variety of people who consider the country is being swamped by foreigners, who think that we'd be better off "not being ruled from Brussels", that "asylum seekers" are here to "steal our jobs". In particular, the local candidate for the BNP, who is a school governor in Brixham (a school governor?? How did that happen?) This view appears to be supported by a number of national newspapers and even the home secretary. I'd like to remind them that this country is not being "swamped" (try standing on top of the Wrekin and ask where the "swamping" is. Look for a non-white face in Torquay, or Brixham).  Everyone in England is "descended from Romans, from Britons, from Anglo Saxons, from Danes, from Normans, from Poitevins, from Scotch, from Huguenots, from Irish, from Gaels, from modern Germans and from Jews, a people so mixed that there is in it hardly a man who can point to seven generations of purely English blood, it is almost absurd to use the almost obsolescent word "race". These fellows are ourselves"*. A famous hero of the patriotic Englishman once wrote that there was no good reason to abandon "the old tolerant and generous practice of free entry and asylum to which this country has so long adhered and from which it has so greatly gained".** Since then we have gained the wonderful contribution of people from the Indian sub continent (Chicken Tikka Masala the most popular restaurant meal); the Caribbean; Turkey; Afghanistan,; Nigeria; Somalia; Palestine, amongst a hundred others, many of whom are fleeing persecution, torture and rape, as well as trying to better themselves, or support their families. Immigrants are people just as you or I. All strength to them, as they benefit our economy and culture while making better lives for themselves. They are as "English" as we are (or will be soon) Quotes from: *Ford Madox Ford ** Winston Churchill

      An afternoon with the Gub Monster  Taking the day's events into our own hands, rather than wait for the "What are you doing today?" phone call, we invited the girl over for the afternoon (her man dosn't leave their flat very often). She brought the milk monster©, which for copyright purposes we will call the "Gub Monster". "Gub" is the word used when the little one (also known as "Puke Monkey") wants her breast feed. We took them on the train to Dawlish Warren, that reknowned den of iniquity and destination of holiday makers from Coventry and Brummagem. Since they have demolished all the little huts selling utter tat on the Warren, the place has been redeveloped with a few new buildings. These include a large new shop (selling tat), an amusement arcade, and a pub. The buildings are all rather lightweightly constructed as their foundations are based on sand and gravel. After a visit to the fairground by the station and a ride for the Gub monster and M on the little train, we proceeded to the shop, where I spent a tenner on some tat for the girl and her offspring. Said offspring selected a rattly wheely thing on a stick which, with great difficulty, she was parted from for 5 seconds in order to scan it. We then retired to the pub and sat outside. M bought the drinks while the girl and I wiped the rain off the benches with a (unused) nappy. I thought it would be jolly to steal the new rattly, sticky, wheely thing from the Gub while she was busy getting soaked playing in the standing rainwater on the other benches. Silly Me. The world's largest tantrum ensued, which included: throwing herself to the ground; banging her head on said ground; screaming; making quite amazing tantrum faces; refusing to take the rattly, sticky, wheely thing back; and generally making a fuss for at least 10 minutes. Wow. What a fine temper. She spent the rest of our time there trying to escape and Gubbing. Discussions included subjects such as "how nice my ex is i.e. my ex girlfriend" (a subject upon which I declined to participate. It is dangerous when your partner starts to talk about your ex, and even worse when they start to get on with her: what if they find they have something in common? It doesn't bear thinking about), and how much their boyfriend/ex partner drink/drank too much and how awful they were and thats why I will leave him/why I left him. Fortunately in this subject I was gently treated ("you might drink, dad, but you can handle it/you might drink, lordhutton, but you dont change into that raving beer monster that he used to"). Anyway, on our journey back to the station, I managed to spend a further 20 quid at the Tat shop on the girl and her girl. Quite how, I dont know. At least someone treats them now and again. I dont envy her, stuck in their flat all day, not going out much, entertaining him and his family, him never going out. Oh well. I was supposed to be making supper but now M has had to do it. Whoops, I better run. A

      What a lovely day  If I turn my head, I can see the small coasters waiting for the tide to come into the harbour. The sun is shining on the sea and the rooftops. I can even see the back window of my daughter's flat, where she lives with her daughter and her man. Today, we went to Dartmoor, and I was allowed to drive the MG with the top down, and failed to find a cache (I blame the leaf cover) but we had a lovely walk and saw a very new foal. Later, we shopped at the organic farm and Safeways and spent a fortune on Not Very Much. Which was displeasurable. However, we then found a lovely pub at Tuckenhay, where BEER was provided by M, which was most gratifying. We then set off on a short walk through some mud, and I was able to set a new cache called "Up Bow Creek" while M slept in the sunlight. Later, the boy failed to show for his tea before his work at 6.30. I drove along the prom to look for him and his skateboarding mates, in order to remind him, but he wasn't there. As I got home, he arrived back too, having got back on the train from Paignton (well, I didn't know where he'd gone). Needlesstosay, I had to drive him into town to his job in the restaurant. Without any supper. Such are the rewards of having no responsibilities. Look. It is so gorgeous living by the sea in May, when the weather is good. Top. Fab. Brilliant. it is like being on holiday every day. mmmm A

      On my own  Today, the boss didn't show. I found out why from his daughter (who worked her last day at the council today). The boss's wife had slid off up to Swindon to arrange a loan to finish fixing their house (the previous loan having apparently financed trips to Africa and Australia, a new car, and putting three daughters through University simultaneously). She also bought a new car without telling the boss. Hence he too fled up to Swindon to check it out. So I was On My Own in the office today. OK, the team were there but they are in the next room. This gave me the opportunity to enhance this page with a new template and a few links, which I spent an hour and a half doing, and did all On My Own, using all that technermerlogical stuff like Hyper Text Meta Language and stuff. And it worked! (and Carol liked it) This evening, M is off out with her women friends at some Thai restaurant over the water in Shaldon, to which I will be driving her shortly. She is catching a taxi back. Once I have dropped her off I will be On My Own, as the boy has gone out. He is off to get a Chinese meal before going to work at his hotel for old ladies. Ho hum what to do? Blowtorch the paint off the fireplace? Chatroom? Clean the bathroom? Do the ironing? Go to the pub? Cancel my subscription to Sky Sports cos City were relegated? Choices choices choices. Sometimes, Being On Your Own is quite good A

      A mistaken present  M has decided that the fireplace in this very room needs stripping of paint to restore it to its original wooden beauty. That needs Nitromors(c) or a blowtorch. OK, so I buy a blowtorch today, (a blowtorch seeming the easier option), gas powered and whoomph, it seems a good'un. I present it to her, as a special romantic present, for her to commence operations with. Unfortunately, her ladyship is apparently used to (from a previous marriage) an electrical version of a blowtorch without real flames (which doesn't seem as much fun) and refuses to use her new present. Now it appears to be my job to treat the fireplace as the new blowtorch is too dangerous and scary. Hmm me think fire good. Me treat house with new gas powered blowtorch. Fire for hunter gathers.  We shall see. A

      This ain't right  I did a whole blog yesterday, about our day with my daughter and her daughter, and M's brother and his wife and son and our meeting at their rented holiday home in the South Hams, and wonderful the place was, with beautiful houses and a great games room.  Chief amongst the features of the blog was a German survey showing that male BMW drivers had more sex, on average, than the drivers of any other sort of car. A fine survey it was too, and so good to see such accuracy in the polling community. Unfortunately, the blog failed to publish itself. I have tried to make my blogging idiot proof but it appears to have been ineffective. Today, I have been on a course on how to load stuff onto the council's website, using something called "obtree". Also touted as being idiot proof, it aint cos it hasn't been tested on idiots. I am in the trainer's "black book" because I asked her if she offered a typing course after she made a number of typing errors (after several other comments, obviously). She was a good trainer and now I know how to do it. I think.  Also, today, I proved a teenager wrong. Fantastic. New t-shirt: "Ask a teenager now, while they know nothing". Ha! A

      Nothing to rant about  Today, we took Holly and Little M down to a very tiny place in the South Hams to visit M's brother and his wife. They are on holiday from Albrighton, near Wolverhampton where they live. They have a nearly two year old called Toby. Little M resisted being sick in the car, which is a new experience. The cottage, and it's neighbouring conversions, were gorgeous, tastefully done and beautifully equipped. The little ones played football on the lawn and generally had a good time together. It's funny to watch new walkers stagger about on an uneven surface. The games room was great: the pool table took old 10ps and 5ps, and the table football had us breathless. The trampoline was great for adults and babies as it was sunk in the ground and surrounded by netting: I didn't hurt myself once, although my leg is sore now. After lunch, Little M, threw up between the cars, and a remarkable vomit it was for a one year old. It had the classic ingredients of a 2am Pavement Pizza, with all the right lumps. She takes after her mother, who once had to clean up the pavement below her bedroom window, after a busy night. She was 15 though, so Little M has an advantage of many years. I do believe that one Henry the Thirst had to clean the windows of up to 4 fellow residents once, when he threw up out of his Berlinerish apartment block on the 5th floor. One tiny downside was that I was unable to set my new cache as the sleeping needs of Little M took precedence. The Great Upside was that, in the pub, once we got home, I read that a German car magazine has done a survey that says that men who drive BMWs have more sex than any other type of car owner. A fascinating result, and so reassuring to see a magazine survey that fully reflects reality. M was unimpressed, as she only has an MG and has gone off for a snooze. They didnt survey British cars, but if they did, she would see she is up with the Beemer owners, poor lass. haha. A

      Rant  It seems to me that the fashions of the 1930s continued through the second world war, and that today we are confronted by the rise of the corporatist power and the fascist association of government with big business, big architecture etc that WW2 was supposed to have halted, yet it continued (eg the Bankside power station, now the Tate, that was built in the '50s yet is a classic fascist design). Big companies (especially from the US, who benefited most from WW2) control almost everything, The government seems to be obsessed with PFI and kowtowing to the Americans. No notice is taken of the threat to introduce GM crops, which nobody (surprise!) seems to want, of the power of Tesco/Asda etc and their control over the food we eat, of the expense of PFI and the cost of denationalised companies and their charges for water, gas, education etc. Our own local government is responsible for barely 4 or 5 per cent of their own funding, the rest coming from central government. We are democratic in name only. We can be poisoned by the food we eat; blamed for being obese yet allow fatty, salty products to be advertised to our children; have cancers caused by irresponsible industrial and agricultural processes; go to war against the wishes of the vast majority of the population; have people tortured and killed in our name; have a media that poisons our minds about people from other countries (and I include in that poor people, tortured people, persecuted people), all apparently wishing to come here and claim non-existent "benefits" ("swamped"?, I don't think so)(barely enough to live on, ask my daughter): ooh what a swamping we got when the EU expanded by 10 countries. Oh, and French people, and Germans, our close and lovely neighbours  so maligned by our media (why do journalist think we are so racist, and why do they encourage it?) It is so saddening to see our "Labour" Government going along with this: introducing ID cards (no defence against "terrorism", yet also, essential in the fight against "terrorism") , taking part in the Iraq debacle, imprisoning people with no trial or lawyers, showing such a lack of independence towards big business and the Americans, encouraging the privatisation of essential services, such as schools, the post office, the railways, the NHS. It has got to stop. Yet when the only politicians worth voting for behave like this, where do we go? People think you are mad when you say these things. They have captured our language and our power. It has got to stop. Fight back. Think local, buy local, believe in your fellow woman or man, whether he or she is from Leicester, Paris, Warsaw, or Calcutta. It's the only way to win. Have a nice day. And I can live with City being relegated.It weren't unexpected. A

      A bucolic day  Caching on Dartmoor. Found two. The weather was not the best and we were swathed in cloud for most of the day, which rather spoiled it as there were some hints of good views. Tempted by a walk around Venford Reservoir (constructed to meet the watery needs of the burghers of Paignton), I was persuaded that lunch at the pub in Holne was more important. M can find any excuse to avoid a walk if lunch beckons.  We heard a cuckoo at one place, a sound I haven't heard for years and years. I had to tell myself it wasn't a pigeon at first. We shared a ploughman's and ate loads of cheese of varying blueness and runnyness. A lively plateful. Plus beer and Chardonnay. I persuaded my daughter that today was not a good day to take her to Tesco's, just because she had received her dole cheque, as the bank holiday traffic was awful and I needed to sleep.  Oh well. Not much to report. Memories of those torture reports keep coming back though. I cant see this having a happy ending. A

      Hen’s Teeth											 If one were trying to partake in Consecutive Number Plate Spotting (CNPS) and felt one was falling behind, the following scheme would suggest itself as one to ensure a rapid catch-up. Hire a luxury coach, sit in the front seat, well above other traffic and stock up well with sandwiches and coffee. Then, instruct the driver to drive the streets of the area along all the main roads, and visit some of the major tourist attractions and car parks in order to survey the massed ranks of passing and parked vehicles. A recipe for rapid progression in the CNPS stakes.  Except that.  Not one, not even a possible one, was spotted. Every other number you can mention, oh yes. Loads  I could save up for a possible return visit. But number 14 is not out on the streets today. I was going cross eyed with looking. Nothing. Zilch. De nada. Nichts. Zero.  Disembarking from the coach, downhearted and tired eyed, I wandered wearily back to the office.   And then…  A coach, parked at a hotel carried the magic number. It was from Lincolnshire, which leads me to believe there has been an historic embargo on the issue of “14”s in this area.  Having brought the issue of CNPS to the attention of the boss’s daughter (“I always thought you were a really interesting person, Andy”) and my sister (“What? Are you sure? Are you 5?”), and my mate Jen (“ I always thought of you as a little eccentric, if not autistic”), I am becoming a little worried.  15 here we come.

      Bringing up Kids  Many years ago, The Previous Lady Hutton decided to leave Hutton Towers (or the 2 up 2 down, then known as Hutton Towers, opposite a factory in Kingston Upon Thames). I was working 12 hour day and night shifts, which presumably contributed to the decision, and suddenly found myself having to call my mother at 4am to look after the two children , aged 5  and 9 months, when I was due at work at 6, because TPLH wasnt home from carousing with her boyfriend (we shared the house for 6 months after her announcement, just before Christmas). As I was the only source of family income, I had to continue to work. TPLH took me to court and won custody and vast maintenance. However, she became increasingly unreliable in her availablity to look after the kids and eventually I stood up, in public, and said, "well just fuck off then, and I will look after them". Shocked, she said "OK". Since then we moved far away. Well OK Devon, via Reading. I have had 4 au-pairs which, in the early days were vital, as both me and my new partner worked. One was a supporter of M. Le Pen in France, one was a loony and had to be sent home. These were many years ago. The new Lady Hutton, to whom I attached myself fairly shortly after was rather domineering, and although we had some good times, usually on holiday away from the children, the rows became worse as the girls (hers and mine) became teenagers. Police were called, knives drawn, shouting matches continued, I hid in cellar with BEER to avoid the arguments. Eventually, appealing to my philanthropical nature, I was persuaded to go to Cologne in July 1999 for the Jubilee 2000 demo, a good long weekend. Which was good. On coming home, I had no furniture, and my sister was there, spitting feathers, having been summoned, in my absence, to look after my children, and to witness the removal of my furniture. TPLH2 having moved out. I hadnt a clue. Eventually, I was allowed the house, she got the endowments. A good deal IMHO TPLH2 occasionally keeps in touch with the boy and girl, but less frequently. We see TPLH1 fairly often, as the pain has subsided and the children need to see their mother (ahem, who has money and sometimes pays for things for them. Pity she could never pay maintenance. I dont think TPLH1 approves of her daughter as she is rapidly turning into Trailer Trash as she spends all her time in her flat with her non working boyfriend. I cant say I disagree, as she turns into an intolerant and grumpy young woman. Nice daughter she has though.  The Present Lady Hutton is wonderful and fortunately has no interest in having children. She tolerates mine. A

      Why My Girlfriend Wont Walk Home With Me  Saturday comes and time for shopping. The non-supermarket campaign continues and we venture into town on foot. Alas, we realise that the car is needed to use as a repository each time we have enough to carry, so M returns to fetch her car. We fill up with jolly things and cart them back each time to deposit in the boot. However, it becomes clear that it is difficult to purchase certain items that don’t come from other than a supermarket. Frubes, for instance, salad cream, and chocolate spread. Oh well, we all must make sacrifices. Also chicken is hard to get hold of, as the two butchers are both chains and do not, apparently, have good records in producing non-industrial meat. Personally, I don’t touch the stuff, but others need their flesh, so an alternative has to be found. Also an alternative needs to be found to having to bring the car the few hundred yards into town, in order to dump the shopping bags each time.  Later, having taken the train to Exeter, we are again lumbered with bags of stuff. Neither of us appear to have purchased much for ourselves, but the boy has done well (football, tennis balls, Rough Guide to the Costa Brava and Map, ooh he gets spoilt). The chicken problem was solved by going to Marks and Spencer (OK, technically it is a supermarket, but what woman can resist going in there? Therefore, I have to accompany her). M&S is so middle class that the chicken couldn’t possibly come from anything so mucky as a factory, could it, darling?  Oh, and why wouldn’t she walk home with me? Because I was sensible, and bought a shopping trolley with wheels. It is the sports version, with two wheels, not four, and it isn’t tartan or leatherette, and it hasn’t got a zip, and it folds down, and it is big enough to get a body in (only if you need to, obviously), and it will save us having to take the car into town. Jonathan Ross has at least one. Nonetheless, this is one step to grandfatherdom too far, and I am condemned to walking home alone, instead of being allowed to accompany M to the car. She wont allow herself to be seen with me and stands nervously in the greengrocer’s (note correct use of the apostrophe, all you greengrocers), eyeing the trolley disdainfully. On my return to the house, the boy shakes his head slowly, and eyes are raised heavenwards. Oh dear. From being 12, I appear to have reached 65 without stopping. One moment I was a happy dad bringing up his kids, next, I am a grandad, with all the trappings. It all happened so quickly. One good thing is that I don’t have any slippers. Yet.

      Moan   I dragged myself back into work today, still very much under the weather. I was confronted by over 200 emithers, 50% of which were spam, using the “business address” loophole (“Hi, my name is Jen…” , “Viagra without prescription…” (hey, who needs Viagra?), “ Add three inches…” etc etc). Another 30% were from my Leicester City mailing list, another 15% were legit regulars like Channel 4 news, leaving, ooh, at least 5% of any immediate relevance.   This lot cleared, it was time for my regular monthly punishment where the disabled access group go over the same frustrating grounds of why Torbay is such a rubbish place. They even got into a rather racist vein today (“It’s ever since we had to cater for those foreigners that “Gents” and “Ladies” has been replaced by those figures of a man and a woman. They can find their way to the Social Security alright. I was born in England….”blah blah blah, cringe. You can guarantee they know zero "foreigners" and especially none finding their way to Social Security, but hey, the country's built on ignorance and bigotry, and disabled people are no different).  The woman I have to give a lift to the meeting, a rather large wheelchair user, was in the chair as usual (as in “chairwoman”). She had fallen on Monday and cracked her head on the bath, hospitalising her. At her own admission, she looks terrible, and told me not to laugh, which obviously I did, and told her she shouldn’t have got in a fight after last night’s football debacle. Her husband is now in the hospice but they let him out for the day and I saw him briefly at the restaurant where I picked her up. Green, fragile, and not really there. There are plans afoot to send him home to die, with a carer for the pair of them. I have talked about these two before, but, wow, do they have it bad. (And their son’s wedding is coming up, and the fiancee is heavily pregnant). My friend seems to be coping and would rather her husband was in the hospice as there is no way either one of them can look after the other. Life seems to happen all at once to some people. I never dreamt, as a Transport Planner (ahem) that there would be so much social work involved.  I think I am happier arguing with the railway company about their 130 errors in the new timetable. 130!  A

      The Wrong Shirt   When England lost to France, I was wearing my slightly soiled England T-shirt. Obviously, that wasn't going to be worn again, so I wore the "On les aura" "Philosophy Football" t-shirt for tonight's match. This tactic failed as you will know from the penalty shoot-out result against Portugal. Other unsuccessful tactics were M lying upside down on the sofa, hiding her head behind the TV guide, and the boy waving his baseball bat around randomly (which I eventually had to prevent, at some cost (teenage boy, uncertain father)). Also, England appeared to score when I was out of the room, so I left the room quite frequently (fag breaks). Sorry. It didn't work. Moron flags taken down. Ingerlan' should have won. B*gger, cos we should have gone further. "We"? well, you know, football gets to you. They might be overpaid bastards, but it feels like they are our overpaid bastards.  Still not well, spent day feeling useless, as a burst of energy could have achieved so much eg painting. I did nothing except make supper and feel rotten for it. You can't achieve much when you are on the loo all day.   I also spent a long time changing the appearance of this blog. If it don't work, please tell me.  A

      The Sights of the M5  I felt a trifle under the weather this morning, so a day off was in order (I wouldn’t  want to spread any bugs amongst my noble fellow-workers, after all). So a lazy morning ensued, during which I fielded a phone call from the Boy’s year head. He wanted to complain about my letter to him, requesting that he sanction the Boy’s week off in July, when he is going to Spain with his mate. Unsurprisingly, he was aggressive, talked to me as if I were some snotty kid caught smoking in the bike shed, and made no mention of the positive parts of my letter, merely nit-picking about “factual” errors in my letter (which weren’t “facts” at all, as I had deliberately hedged my language with “apparently”s and “it might be“s – that’s one of the benefits of working in local government: the art of “diplomacy”). He  refused to “approve” the time off , in spite of my assertion that children are anyway entitled to up to 2 weeks off per year (which is true, and verified by a headmistress and an ex teacher, and besides, the Boy is 17 and doesn’t actually have to go to school if he doesn’t want to). Sounded more concerned with his record keeping and tick boxes to me. Not a nice man, and left me feeling thoroughly shaky and downhearted and glad I am not still at school. At least bullies at work can be dealt with, with the protection of Unions. The responsibilities of parenthood, eh?  Anyway, on my brief shopping trip into town, I called at the bookshop (we have a very good one, which is more than you can say for our neighbouring metropolises of Torquay and Paignton). I picked up a copy of “Othello”, ordered by the Boy and by some famous historical bloke, and could not resist “M5 Sights Guide” by Mike Jackson and Kristina Thimm, a guide to everything you can see, or are within reach of, from the M5 motorway from Sandwell to Exeter. This is Anorak City. From factories and shops to churches and caravan parks. It includes the Willow Man and the papier mache camel (now 21 years old!). They even interview security guards at roadside distribution centres. Teignmouth to Birmingham will never be the same again. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have tickboxes for the sights you have seen, but, very wisely, it has on the cover, a warning: “DRIVERS – DO NOT USE WHILE TRAVELLING”. Good advice.  A

      Upton Snodsbury, Pinvin, Libbery, Flyton Flavell, Wyre Piddle, Sheriff's Lench and Peopleton  Are all villages in Worcestershire that we drove through or nearby today on the way to our friend's house in "the Lenches". I know these must have made sense to Johnny Saxon but they look strange when written down in modern english. A brief stay at the friend's house saw us emerge with enough veg from their garden to open a greengrocers. What a healthy week we will have.  Earlier, we had met up with the lovely Mort and her lovely parents to do a cache at Aqualate Mere, near Newport (Salop). It is a wonderful thing to meet someone you have only ever met on the internet. One may get a feel for what people are like on the internet, and each time it has happened to me, they are completely different from what I expected. It was really great to meet them and we hope to do it again sometime.  After finding the cache, we had a very pleasant walk to the Mere, which is virtually invisible from anywhere as it is surrounded by woods and reed beds. The bird hide is a good place to see it, although the people that had previously logged the birds they had seen, must have been lucky (or delusional). We saw two ducks. Then two more ducks flew in and frightened off the first two. That was it. No eagles, condors, flamingoes or pterodactyls. Nothing. Most disappointing. Nor any thin men with hairy feet.

      The Day I Kissed a Headmistress  Off to Shropshire to M's nephew's 2nd Birthday Party. Obviously I tried to make the long slog up the M5 as interesting as possible by finding a fellow speedy partner to whizz up the motorway. When this failed, I find tailgating outside lane hoggers while doing 95 is a fun distraction. At the party, a great time was had by all, including dozens of other 2 year olds whose dads are at RAF Cosford nearby. Yet again, M's brother and I seemed to spend hours constructing the little lad's new toys. This time it was a tractor which refused to be built. Luckily, after about half an hour we decided to read the instructions.  The two year olds took about two hours to find that sharing is good. Then they discovered that golf clubs make good weapons......  M's dad and step-mum arrived (M is actually older than her step-mum, which is slightly weird). The step-mum has just been made a headmistress. Big responsibility: all of 27 kids in rural Bucks. That was when I got to kiss a headmistress. Not a thing many people have done, I imagine.  The availability of plentiful supplies of BEER didnt prevent me taking time off to do a nearby cache, although it was a long walk, during the course of the evening. Later, M and I strolled back to the B&B, a little the worse for wear. We managed to miss the 2nd half of the Holland - Czechland match as we stopped off to lie in a field watching the sun go down. I think we gave the man walking his dog quite a shock when he stumbled over us in the long grass. The B&B was lovely, though. Much better service than you'd normally get in a hotel  A

      Mussolini's chin,and painting the stairs.  Apparently, Mussolini poked his chin forward to make him look more powerful and sexually attractive, like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. M says, that when I do it, it doesn't work for her. On balance, I suspect she's right.  Another thing: I ripped up the nasty carpet on the cellar stairs today.Ooh it was filthy. Painting over the steps was problematical as it has to be done from above, as I dont want to spend the night in the cellar, while waiting for it to dry. The cats will no doubt do their best to tread it through the house.  A

      Blackberry and Apple Pie  Today, I met my Shopmobility co-ordinator and her friend at Yates's in town to present Yates's with a certificate. This is because their pub is very accessible to scooter and wheelchair users and the staff are really helpful. After an espresso, I make to leave but am persuaded not to, and end up with a 2 & 1/2 hour chat and a couple of pints of Stella. It makes for good customer relations with the co-ordinator and takes me up to lunch time. Back at the office, emails dealt with and necessary printing produced (the one at home is knackered), I leave early to take some photos of Torquay's derelict railway station. This gives me the opportunity to get back early, take the printer to be fixed and order the addtional stuff we need to add the PCs to the Broadband modem. And also to be back in time for the football. Ahem  Before I leave, the boy rings, in his usual irrelevant manner, to request he has custard with something tonight. An ideal opportunity to use the frozen apples, blackberries and pastry purchased from the farm shop at the weekend. During half time, the pie is made. I am in fear of how the pastry will be because I ended up flattening it by hand as it and the rolling pin appeared to have an unstoppable attraction. 40 minutes later, out it comes, with perfect pastry. And how yummy it is. The Boy even comments as to it's loveliness. Thank you Farm Shop.  The last two nights, I have taken a late dip in the sea. The first night was spontaneous and therefore went unnoticed in the local seafront community. Last night, the rolled up towel was noted out and back.  "Enjoy your swim?"  "Lovely".  [Aside]"He cant have enjoyed it much, he was so quick".  Actually, because I didnt wear my glasses in the water, and it was nearly dark, I slipped on an underwater rock and grazed my leg from toe to hip, so I got out quite quickly. More subtlety required if I go tonight.

      Marine Aquarium, Plus Broadband.  Access meeting today in Plymouth followed by a visit to the National Marine Aquarium to check for disabled access. If I was in need of easy access, handrails, proper signing and information, indication of gradient change in dimly lit corridors and access to all areas by lift, then I would struggle. Yet it's only 6 years old. Lovely fish, lovely concept, poor in detail.  Broadband: We have the modem, we have the wires, I want to conect two PCs through the BT modem. BT want nearly 200 squids for a new box. Google tells me I need a Network Interface Card per computer plus an Ethernet crossover cable and I suspect we already have the NICs. Is this right? And are BT trying to pull a fast one on a technermological novice such as myself?  A

      A sticky evening   A doubt has been cast on my nearest cache, so I set off on my bicycle (a rare treat) after the football to check it was still there. A glorious evening ride along the sea wall towards Dawlish ensued, as the setting sun glistened upon the sea, with the cliffs and railway being cast in shadow. Sometimes you can see Portland Bill from here but I was probably a little too close to sea level tonight. There was no-one about, and the cache was easily located.  It being so warm, I decided to take the first swim of the year. The sea was calm and milky warm. The swim was wonderful, soothing and relaxing. One of the chief benefits of living here IMHO. A short cycle  home in the balmy evening air and all are ready for an early bed (except the one watching “Resident Evil”, but I really don’t want to know about that).  Earlier, I attended an “Equalities Policy” meeting at the Town Hall. I really live in a different world from these people who speak in a language of policy and jargon and action plans and “best value”  etc. I would prefer to stay clear.  I raised a laugh though when the lovely Director of Social Services said she thought someone looked “too young” for a particular post. “Ahem you may be in breach of the ageism policy, page 16” I quipped. Oh how we fell about.  Tomorrow I am fortunate enough to be able to attend the South West Access Forum, which involves a visit after lunch to the National Marine Aquarium at Plymouth Barbican. Free lunch provided. Nice.

      New addition  Welcome to the world to Leo Spalding, my nephew, born today at 1245pm.  Additionally, the new rail timetable between Exeter and Paignton ensures there is no departure from here between 8am and 10am to Paignton thus ensuring dozens of people arrive at work ludicrously early or ludicrously late, and up to 150 schoolkids miss their exams. Apparently the connection at 0854 at Newton Abbot is not a connection as the train to paignton is likely to pull out just as your train gets in, thus ensuring the two hour gap. The two trains are run by the same company you say? Tough. Well done Wessex Trains, and welcome to the world of your parents having to drive you to school. Your train home, incidentally, does run, but is helpfully not in the timetable. Except it doesnt run on nights like tonight thus ensuring a 45 minute wait. Congratulations all round. I love the privatised railway.  Supermarket stats: 0 CNPS stats: stuck on 4 Football stats: Sweden 5, Bulgaria 0 Furniture stats: 4 chairs and a dining room table  A

      Families and “Oh for god’s sake”  M and I drove to Totnes, intending to collect the dining chairs we’d bought yesterday. Of course, we had to buy the table that went with them (of course, my chequebook is open my dear), and that prevented us from going caching as you cant leave the car in a car park with the boot open with stuff sticking out for two hours without it getting nicked.  An afternoon building chairs and painting and generally doing the house up was interrupted when the Girl arrived, with the usual attachment, just in front of my snooze. Oh well, an eventful few hours was had with the little one running amok in the house. For a one year old she is certainly developing her own personality, and is becoming a very amusing little girl. Slightly worrying is her habit of crashing her forehead onto something hard when she is having a strop. However, she can also bang her head on the floor while standing up, which is such a comedy move that she gets short shrift from her amused audience. They are staying the night because him indoors is “grumpy”. We don’t have much choice I suppose. An acquired pleasure. In the mean time, my sister rings, saying her boy is accused of credit card fraud via the internet, while he and his mate are cat-sitting at next doors house and borrowing next door’s credit cards. My sister is upset and emotional and convinced of her boy’s innocence. Obviously, this is not the first time this has happened to Pay pal and e bay and they are sympathetic and helpful. It turns out that email addresses used, and the goods ordered, are nothing to do with her boy and all to do with his scally mate (although her address was used for delivery (she is out in the day)). So, brilliant for her boy’s innocence and her belief in him. And hopefully he will dump his dodgy mate. In the meantime, neither my mother or my little sister can be contacted, because I suspect little sister is having a caesarean because her due date was a week ago. Good luck to her and my I be the first to say “welcome to the world”, to my new nephew. England: Stephen Gerrard, Emile Heskey, David Beckham. For god’s sake. What were you doing? What a farce.

      Trainspotting  Today we took the Girl and her Girl for a trip out to Totnes. My chief aim was to set a cache, whereas M's and the Girl's aim was to look in the shops. We were also going to look at the regatta on the River Dart as recommended by a colleague who was participating. All aims were achieved: the cache was set by the river; we saw the regatta and it was dreadfully dull (the spectators seemed to consist entirely of families and friends of the participants, yet another thing about which I know nothing); we got to the shops where I was allowed to buy the Girl and the Girl's Girl some new clothes. Additionally, I spotted a closing down sale at a furniture place (oh silly, silly me, I should have known it would cost money) , and we are now the proud possessors for four brand new Charles Rennie MacKintosh style dining room chairs which we can collect tomorow, it being slightly impractical to bring them home on the train. After that we went back to the station where I had a long chat with the Girl's Girl, (aged 15 months) before getting on a very late Virgin Voyager, the first time the two of them had experienced such a train. Changing trains at Newton Abbot, I had further conversations with the young lady. She will go as far as waving at the train if I will too, but does not appear to watch with fascination as the trains arrive and depart. She was more interested in the rooks on the track looking for food. Perhaps trains today are just too dull. A

      Metro Maps of the World  My new books arrived today. The Boy thought it was extremely amusing that one was “Metro Maps of the World” and took the mickey. Actually it is quite a good graphic history of how public transport information is conveyed to its’ customers. Take the incomparable way Beck created the London Underground map and compare it with the chaos of New York or Tokyo maps.  It did spur me to think, though, that the map book is the sort of thing my father would like (and hence the derision of the Boy). Do men grow more like their fathers as they grow older? I can certainly think of a few things, like grumpiness, gardening, the same tone of voice sometimes, grandadish cars, interest in things past eg steam trains, a certain pleasure in seeing their children/grandchildren go home at the end of the day. Some of these things are a natural part of getting older, others are really like the things my dad does uniquely. I’m actually quite different from Dad: I can’t get my head round books about the insides of battleships or histories of military uniforms, he can; he has been entirely monogamous since he got married 46 years ago, whereas I have not (not entirely my fault, I might add); I can express my emotions via tears and talk, whereas I’d be most surprised if he ever did; I can look after my self and do housework which he does extremely reluctantly; I don’t need telling about housework, unlike my dad, who is told in no uncertain terms;  I brought my children up, whereas I suspect, my mother brought her children up The Boy, who has finished his first year A level exams today, when it was suggested he might be like me one day, guffawed. Maybe he’ll be like his Grandpa. The other book was a book of massage, seemingly innocent from the blurb, but a cornucopia of soft porn on the inside. Something to share with M later, I suspect;-) A

      Wild Man on the Loose  It may be recalled that Shopmobility had a scooter “withheld” yesterday, by a person who was later arrested. The scooter was recovered, but the person, sadly, has not. Whilst in the “Hope and Grope”  (not it’s real name but a good enough approximation) at lunchtime, an older looking man, clad bizarrely in a blue waist length hospital style smock, and fitting the description of our thief, comes in and is refused service. He argues that he can’t be banned because he hasn’t been to Torquay for 10 years, but the two women behind the bar are adamant. He argues and argues in an odder and odder fashion, claiming  discrimination against his disability, amongst other things. What disability? He is obviously a bit strange and apparently has a habit of upsetting the other customers. His disability appears to be mental illness and I can see his point, but a pub is a pub, and upsetting the customers is not what it is about (or perhaps it is because they are notoriously understaffed and provide a dreadfully slow service). Discrimination against disabled people is fairly common and needs to be sorted, but in this case I could see their point, especially as it was becoming clear that he was our abuser and thief of yesterday. Eventually he wanders off. Later, it is reported to me that he has visited the Council’s shop again, where the police are again called but he is not arrested. Trying to warn my volunteers at Shopmobility, I am too late as he has already been round there to give them a hard time. Other people have also seen him shouting and remarked upon his strange hospital style attire. For safety, I rang the two psychiatric wards at the hospital, but they are not missing anyone, and couldn’t fit his description to anyone they knew. I am really concerned for my volunteers as they are  [choose one or more] old, disabled, female, isolated from the main shopping area, on their own. They are volunteers and are not paid to put up with this abuse. Hopefully, he will drift off as suddenly as he drifted in. He needs help, but who is to give it? A

      Torbay Shopmobility – Annual General Meeting (scooters for hire to disabled people)  For my sins, I am chair of both Torbay Shopmobility (Torquay, Paignton, Brixham) and Paignton Shopmobility (who as they were established 10 years ago, maintain a stubborn independence, although they do deign to send a rep to the main committee). Today was the AGM. The signs weren’t good:   This morning I had a call saying a scooter had been stolen from Torquay Shop and the matter reported to the police. Some punter had returned long after closing time with his scooter and was understandably told off by the volunteers who had had to stay on to take the scooter back.  Said punter objected to this and took the scooter and hightailed it for the hills. This morning he turned up at the Council “One-Stop Shop” to complain about his treatment, that he was withholding the scooter until he had got satisfaction and to find out if the Council would take action on Shopmobility. We were called but by the time we, and security, arrived, he had fled, still in possession of a £2000 scooter belonging to a charity. Disturbed by this, I looked round town for someone fitting his description, but to no avail. Later, I got an upsetting phonecall from the co-ordinator, who was on duty on her own in the shop (but fortunately being visited by our local scooter supplier and repairer). She had been visited by the same disgruntled punter, who had demanded his £2.50 deposit back, without actually returning the scooter. When, unsurprisingly, he was refused, he became abusive, even drowning out the co-ordinator’s voice as she tried to speak to 999 and giving her a really hard time(and my co-ordinator is a tough cookie. At least she had someone with her). The police eventually arrived and arrested him and took him, babbling, away. There was talk of him not being born on this planet and all sorts of stuff which I suspect means he will be down the psychiatric unit tonight. He had already been spotted at the town centre charity for mental health problems. As it happens, the local homeless centre reported that the scooter was hidden in their car park (although he wasn’t a resident) and so we were able to retrieve it. I am now having to spend a lot of money on linking the shop to the shopkeepers security radio system, which will protect vulnerable staff.  There was a fire alarm in my office while I was trying to deal with this.  (On other occasions we have had a scooter stolen, by a local druggie (Scooter not recovered); users driving into shop windows and breaking the glass, and blaming the scooter (they are plastic bodied and do 4 mph max!); scooter users driving recklessly through pedestrians (we ban them when reported) and someone reversing into a lake: hilarious, but fortunately a passer by saved them from drowning).  Anyway, we got to the AGM (see heading) only to find the room wasn’t booked. I swear I did it months ago, but it was by phone, so who can tell? Luckily, the hallkeepers are friendly and flexible, so we get the room.  Reports got through, anecdotes exchanged, committee resigns and re-elected as before and all is hunky dory (Except I am still chair, but, hey, it was unanimous). Finalise the joint constitution at last (it’s taken years (see determined Paignton independence, above)).  Except that my friendly neighbourhood councillor points out we have passed the constitution with a meeting of 8 when the constitution demands a quorum of 10. Simple: alter the constitution. Done. Perhaps I could get a job in Iraq? Apparently they need a constitution.  Finally, it took me two hours to get home, because I wouldn’t stand at the bus stop waiting for a bus, thus missing two while I walked two miles to the station. This made me miss a train which led to me having to wait for an hour for the next one. It should have been half an hour but they were all late/cancelled/broken/diverted/down at the station all in a row.   All in a day’s work.  A

      A Day by the Sea  We live by the sea. I can see it if I look behind me, through the open window. But we have little to do with it on a day to day basis, apart from to see it and marvel at its wonders and changes. I don't know any fishermen, or coastguards, or lifeboat men, or people who do the rowing races, or people who work at the docks. Today was quite different. I had planned to set a new cache at Dawlish Warren, so we caught the early train (we are blessed with a summer Sunday morning service) and got off at the Warren at 10.30. There was a thick sea mist, which came only to the water’s edge. On the brief train journey we glimpsed sailing boats drifting mysteriously in and out of the mist. At the Warren, the mist was thick and cool, drifting over the station and the caravans. We walked past the little development of fruit machines, pub and shop and on to the beach. Already, the beach was quite busy with hopeful sunbathers, stripping off in the mist, trying to absorb the thin rays piercing the cloudy shroud (Peotry, as Molesworth might sa). Further on, still shrouded in mist, and away from the crowds, we could hear an invisible microlight to the left, and, bizarrely, bagpipes (bagpipes!)  playing “Scotland the Brave” to our right. Towards the tip of the Warren, amidst the skylarks and Turnstones, the mist cleared to reveal Exmouth and the “Jurassic Coast” in all its’ glory. M settled down for a read, while I set off to set the cache. Having returned from a successful mission, we sat and picnicked. The Warren is by no means a peaceful place: in spite of the very few people around, and the extreme beauty of the scenery, we heard, in addition to the earlier microlight and bagpipes, dozens of light aircraft; more microlights; jet skis; a military jet doing a fly-past for Exmouth D-Day celebrations; maroons at Exmouth also for D-Day; various fishing boats chugging past; trains hooting; sirens from the sailing club; the loud speaker from a pleasure boat tout drifting across the water. If we had been deaf, it would have been gloriously peaceful, warm and almost Mediterranean. Having had enough of that, we rejoined the sweaty throngs of caravanners enjoying the half term break and risked a quick pint at the beachside pub, amidst the tables of abandoned lunches and empty beer glasses. I do object to paying well over the odds for a couple of drinks (£5.28 for a BEER and a small Chardonnay), and then having to sit among a load of grotty plates and glasses, and people who overeat and over drink and leave their dogs and babies exposed to the bright sunlight. When will we learn? While we were on the beach, B&S rang, and offered us some mackerel that S had caught that morning out with her dad and brother. In all the years I have lived here, no-one has ever offered us local caught fish, so I gladly accepted. Now delivered, they are marinating in the fridge. As I write, the sun is going down over the golden sea,  and the swifts are buzzing madly past the window, I can see the back window of my daughter’s flat shining in the evening sun, The Boy is watching Spanish TV programmes (it helps with his revision, apparently), and M is getting on with the painting and housework that I should have done earlier.  Only the thought of work tomorrow gets me down.... A

      Having No Insurance  M and I took The Girl and mini M to a first birthday party in Torquay, today. We went on the bus, where mini M entertained some of the passengers. Arriving at the party we were regaled with food and drink (as it should be). While we were there, more and more kids arrived, of varying ages. They all had a wonderful time, as far as their own little problematic personalities would let them. The recipient of the first birthday party, young Jack, is looked after for much of the week by his dad's mother, who is also a foster carer. Many of the guests were also foster carers, who brought along there own broods, and they all got along swimmingly, with some strict instructions ("you won't get it if you ask like that , young lady"). One of the foster mothers was talking about smelling smoke this morning (early, around 7am), and eventually chiselling out one of her kids who was setting fire to things under the bed. She lets none of her foster kids go out alone to the shops, and for good reason. They buy matches. Apparently, no Insurance Company will insure her because of the high risk of her kids. Therefore, if her house burns down, she is not covered. Some kids are so disturbed they will thoughtlessly burn or kill, and there are people out there who will try to look after them. I am sure they are well paid, but it's not my cup of tea. Well done foster parents.  A

      Shopping without Supermarkets (II)  Having decided to get by without the supermarket this week, I set off into town (with the car as I am blowed if I am walking back up the hill with all that stuff). I visited 8 different shops and returned to the car three times. The order of the shops was erratic cos obviously the shops aren't in the same order as the supermarket shelves. I visited the butcher, the baker, the health food shop, the fishmonger, the pet shop, the greengrocer, the deli and the offy on trip one, having picked up the newspaper from the cafe at the station on the way down. I bought some lovely things that I wouldn't normally get from a supermarket (eg Orkney Herrings to go with the Aquavit that my ex brought down last weekend, and some Gentleman's Relish for toast). Once home, I realised that some things that present themselves as obvious at supermarkets aren't present when walking round town ie I had missed loads of stuff. However, price wise, things were looking good, probably cheaper than the supermarket. It only took an hour, used less petrol and was quicker than driving the usual 6 miles each way to Tescos. Trip no.2 I walked. Starting with the pub on the beach, where the grockles were behaving themselves in the glorious sunshine, I visited the cornershop (where else can you get frozen peas?), the £1 shop How does that work? What about inflation? Will it become the £1.02 shop?) and the toy shop for more pirate gear (I now have a dagger, a hook, a compass, a telescope and a pistol, oh and an eye patch). I got nothing done at home but a most enjoyable day. You can talk to shopkeepers in a way that is not possible at the supermarket. I probably wouldn't touch their politics with a barge-pole, but it is good fun to have a josh and some friendly banter. It was also very healthy in that I got loads of exercise. I will do it again.  It took most of the day in the end, but not a penny to the big bad supermarkets. The herrings go really well with Aquavit mmmmm  A

      Shopping without supermarkets  The three of us have come to the conclusion that it is better to eat properly without Supermarkets. It started with The Boy wanting to stop eating Nestle products (is that possible?). Then we all got thinking, and actually we are fairly good anyway, although lazy in things like microwave meals. M, The Boy and I all work, and at different times, so meals can be dificult. Supermarkets boast about how they force prices down, supposedly for our benefit, but really for their own enormous profit, thus forcing: farmers out of business; the loss of traditional crops and animal breeds; the homogenisation of all our food by shape and colour and not by taste or nutrition; the addition of vicious fats and sugars into ours and our children's food; the exploitation of 3rd world farmers; unnecessary transport of foodstuff across the country and around the world with all the pollution etc that that causes etc etc. Oh, and proper cheese. I miss that. The plan is to use the local greengrocer as much as possible, bearing in mind they are not organic necessarily but we have used them for years and they are a one shop local business. Secondly, the local health food shop, also a small local chain, for basics like rice, pasta, butter. Thirdly the local butcher, as long as it is not LLoyd Maunder (who make the pasties etc for the supermarkets, and, alledgedly, with dodgy meat. I wouldn't care because I don't touch the stuff. Meat, that is). Fourthly by thinking of local sources of other supermarket stuff eg loo roll, baked beans, canned drinks for lunch boxes, choclit, although, actually the sourcing of this stuff might be worse than say, recycled loo roll, or organic drinks from the supemarket. Anything else will have to come from the supermarket, whether tis  Sainsbury or Tesco, but ideally, a whole week with no supermarket input will be a good result. I think it won't be too much more expensive either. I have a whole day off tomorrow to investigate this, which could pull the rug from under the whole scheme because I can't do that every week, and if we are away, the whole thing falls apart. There is an organic farm shop about 10 miles away which has most everything, and isn't that much more expensive (also their lovely organic bread goes off in 24 hours. Oh! just like in France where it goes stale quickly too, but hey they have a baker in every village, which is how it should be. Perhaps they need to put more chemicals in it;-) but I dont think the additional fuel and pollution cost make it worthwhile unless we are driving past, which is a shame. Just shopping carefully in our own town makes a lot of difference. Any advice welcomed. A

      Lurrve  M and I have been together for 4 and a half years (and yes I can do days, hours, minutes, if required) and I love her to bits. We got together barely 3 or 4 months after we had split up from previous partners (she from her husband of a dozen or so years, who left for someone else, and me from my partner of about 10 years who moved out one weekend, with my two kids watching, while I was in Germany doing Jubilee 2000. She didn't move out for anyone else, but just because she thought one of us would kill the other, at some point. Wise woman. My daughter wished she'd done it 10 years before).  M wont get married again, she says, because she doesn't want to be hurt like that again, but I would marry her, like a shot, just as a sign of commitment, and because she is , to me , so wonderful. She wont say she loves me very often, but saves it up for when it's needed. Last night she said, as we were cuddling up for sleep, "I feel safe". How good is that?  A  Yes, that was wet and weedy, but, hey, so what?

      Football  I can't seem to get into supporting England. They were pretty mediocre tonight. I like football, but it always seems to be so messy, and always, somebody scores when you are looking elsewhere. The concept of supporting your country as opposed to your local/birthplace team seems difficult to me. Perhaps it's a tribal thing and a country is too vague for that. Perhaps I just don't like patriotism with its history of exclusion of "other" people. I am can be proud of my country when it does, or has, good things, such as beautiful countryside, but I can't support my country, "right or wrong". Supporting your own town team seems much more acceptable. Leicester can't invade Iraq, or commit atrocities, (although their players can be accused of crime, they didn't actually do it) but as a team they can get promoted and relegated, which in the scheme of things seems much less harmful to the human race. Perhaps in the end, human life needs to be lived on a far more local level, and an end to multinationals, and superpowers. I can't see it happening soon, though. Flying England flags from cars and dressing kids in England shirts. Stop it, it's not right, and just shows you shop at Sainsburys like everyone else. The Boy and I were in Latvia a couple of years ago. Virtually every house had the Latvian flag flying. Understandable if you were celebrating Latvia's independence after 50 years under the Russian jackboot, but a little frightening if you didn't fly the flag, or if you were a Russian immigrant. Maybe Latvia is small enough to be a tribe. M likes football, a remarkable quality in a woman, I think. She comes from a completely different angle, though. She supports West Ham, because her dad supported them (because Jimmy Greaves played for them), but also Watford, because they were her local team. She'll also do Leicester, except when they are playing Watford. We have been in both home and away ends at Watford vs Leicester. Also she'll insist on watching TV football then drift away, but I do that too. One team for me, the town where I was born. And that's how it should be. A

      Heavy Metal  Arriving back from the pub at about 20.30. next door scallies are playing some sort of drum and bass at a trillion decibels. My revenge is to play MC5 "Kick out the Jams" at level 25. Unfortunately this is curtailed by M, being hot on revenge, but cool on embarrassment. So I have to endure it with the door closed. Shame.  Tomorrow, I was supposed to deliver 20 documents to both of Government Office South West in Bristol, and Department for Transport in Victoria. Bristol has been diverted to Plymouth, apparently,&nbsp;but train tickets have already been booked. Therefore, tomorrow, I will travel to Bristol for no reason in particular and then go to London to deliver the documents&nbsp;there. Luckily, it means I may meet&nbsp;my lovely children at Paddington on their return from their mother's holiday pad in Suffolk and accompany them back home. What a happy coincidence.  CNPS stats: an annoying 28 Child stats: 0 Music Stats: Kick Out The Jams, Mother.. (oops doorbell) Computer Stats: Computer Repair Man has enabled broadband on J's PC upstairs with the new router but has been unable to link it to my rubbish PC downstairs (running Windows&nbsp;Rubbish ME). This means Internet contact is dependent on J being away. Which he is.&nbsp;

      Learning to Fly   Holly, Justin and Melissa have gone up to Suffolk today, by train, to visit Holly and Justin’s mum, who has hired a holiday home near Southwold. It’s the first time they have crossed London on their own, but they have achieved it successfully. They are now settling in for a couple of days with their mother (and in Melissa’s case, grandmother tee hee). I am proud of Holly getting all the way on her own, as she doesn’t travel much, mostly being stuck in her flat with her agoraphobic boyfriend, and she has had to take loads of luggage for herself and the baby and fight her way across London on the tube. She used to travel up to London fairly often to see her mum, but taking one train and being met is different to getting across London with a pushchair and luggage. So. Good for her. I hope it will make her want to get away from this small town a bit more and make something of her life. Justin, I’m not so worried about, as me and him (and M) have travelled extensively, and he knows his way around. It is strange having none of my family around. They are both fully fledged independent now, and can get on with their lives without me worrying about them or mithering too much.  M has insisted on doing the housework tonight. I have been used, with previous partners, to doing most of the cooking and housework myself. Since I have been with M, I seem to have done less and less, making me feel a lazy bugger sometimes. I don’t get to do the ironing, the dusting, the washing up, cleaning the bathroom. I have never been with a person as considerate, thoughtful, and hardworking as she. I am not used to it even after nearly 5 years together. (My parents also recognise this and treated her with the admiration she deserves at the weekend). I just get to sit around smoking, drinking and reading. Which is good, but I will have to get myself a hobby. Having children and a house to look after for 20 years has left me slightly hobby-less. Ah, yes, perhaps I should break out the model railway, down in the cellar. It may need some investment as it has been mothballed for quite some time. Time for me to get a new life also.  Last night, out the front, in the street, a pair of young seagulls were bleating madly. They had grounded before being able to fly, having lived on nearby rooftops. Accepted policy is to grab them and chuck them up on to a wall or garage roof, where they have a chance of being fed and not being savaged by cats (aka Monty, who is as big as a dog). M went rushing out, replete with umbrella to protect herself from marauding parent birds, to catch them and put them somewhere where they would shut up. They wouldn’t have it and shied away. I caught one a few weeks ago, but these were older and more canny. I joined M, still with her umbrella and pursued one up the street. It ran and hid in a neighbours yard. The other one, also unwilling to be caught, ran before me, but then took off, achieving the seagull equivalent of the Wright Brothers feat at Kitty Hawk, and flying a few feet and landing on the grass in safety. That one will survive and I’d like to think I taught it to fly. M, on the other hand, with her umbrella, is not Mary Poppins, and she was unable to leave the ground.

      Kids  Saturday Morning took M and I to Ferring in Sussex, a journey completed in 3 hours, which I thought was fair. Parents had established camper van&nbsp;in convenient parking space on West Sussex's only piece of undeveloped sea front, so we huddled behind the wind shelter against gale force winds awaiting the arrival of my sister, brother in law, and neice and nephew, ready for the barbecue that eventually had to be held back at the house, out of the wind.  Eleanor, aged 7, accompanied me in establishing a micro cache by the sea, and we then went to watch the helicopter which was giving 5 minute rides along Worthing sea front (85 squids for 3, thankyou very much). As we watched, the passengers boarded, and I swear the pilot deliberately flew forwards towards us, with his blades spinning perilously close. "Scary" I said. "I wasn't frightened" said she. Served her right the ice cream van's freezer was playing up and she got a runny ice cream. Eleanor is going to Paris tonight with my M&D. Lucky girl.  Leo aged 6 weeks,&nbsp;spent the afternoon snoozing in M's arms. She would have made a wonderful mum, but that is another story.  Toby,  aged two, M's nephew, came down from Telford to an 80th birthday party in Guildford on Sunday&nbsp;(previously, I had found a cache in Guildford and recovered a brand new "Saxomastraw", left by my good friend Henry the Thirst. I tried to entertain the children with it but I couldn't&nbsp;seem to get it&nbsp;to make a noise. Funny, that). Toby gleefully helped himself&nbsp;to the buffet long before anyone else, and dumped his treasures half eaten on the table. He smiled happily, a rare sight, and so cute.  Maisie, also two, was at the party. She was born with dislocated hips, but seems fine now, except for a streak of contrariness and a desire for revenge.  Melissa was at home when we arrived back&nbsp;and stayed the night. She got a pushchair from Great Grandma (aged 64, poor woman) which she leapt upon with great delight, and charged up and down the hall. Poor teddy was petrified. Eleanor (above) had donated a shopping trolley which Melissa wasn't supposed to have yet, but she found it anyway and tantrumically gained possession of. That's one thing she and I now have in common, apart from being directly related to her mum, a shopping trolley. Look out Teignmouth! Melissa came to Tescos tonight. She was the Puke Monkey, as usual, in the car. I was taken 3 times around the shop by her, as her mum got their shopping in. Oh to be 16 months and be amused by someone blowing on your neck. (Actually, that sounds quite nice).

      &nbsp;  I went over to Shopmobility this morning because the co-ordinator had called a volunteer meeting. We sat out on the pavement watching the traffic go by. It went fine. I noticed there was a water leak coming from the pavement next door at 11.15, I reported it and by 11.50 the engineers were looking at it. Amazing. After a happy lunch with the guys and gals from Marketing and Design, and Th e Tourist Board, I went to survey the local CAB office for disabled access. Not good (1st floor, no lift) but they offer their services by other means so not too much of a problem. My route back to the office involves going to the multi-storey car park and catching the lift to th 5th floor where you can exit via a bridge to the other entrance (the car park is built by a cliff). As I was walking to the entrance, a bottle hit the ground and exploded right next to me. I jumped and looked up nervously in case of other missiles and saw an oik leering down ("uh huh huh uh uh". Baseball cap. Twat). I went up to the 5th floor exit. They were hanging about and appeared to go into the adjacent hotel, which was a bluff as they didn't get in. They saw me so I made the obligatory pretend phone call to piss them off. They came out of the hotel and wandered off. I called the hotel but they weren't residents, but they would gladly have helped castrate the little shits if they had been caught. This evening, after the Boy came in with minimal notice for food before work (microwave macaroni cheese, supermarket having been unavoidable this weekend), we went to the pub. Sitting on the quay, we overheard a phone conversation to an "Amanda" (boss's wife's name), "lord of the rings"(boss's house has an LotR name) and "not for 18 years". Seems that friend of boss 's wife is calling&nbsp;her old friend and we are there! eeek!. We butt in when phone call finished and it is true, 'tis the boss's house she is seeking&nbsp;and she has not seen her friend for 18 years. We give her detailed instructions on how to find boss's house.&nbsp;On her departure, I called boss and wife. Seems like they are hysterically amused about the coincidence. But. Sounds like they were avoiding friend for these 18 years and I wonder how our help will go down. Ooops. Away for the weekend now. Driving to Sussex. Lots of holiday traffic. Oh goody.

      Working at Home  I took yesterday afernoon off, ostensibly to "work at home" but actually to let Computer Repair Man in. Trouble is, he didn't show. He is still waiting for an email from Someone Who Knows These Things to tell him&nbsp;how to fix my Router and defeat the evil software of BT. I therefore actually felt obliged to do some actual work. While at home. I ended up working until after 9 oclock, but I ended up getting the whole document completed, a task I had allocated to today. This working at home seemed so efficent and productive that I thought I might do it again today, tidying up the loose ends of my lovely policy document. The Boss believes in "working at home" for himself (although his extension still seems to be taking a mighty long time to construct) and could hardly say no me doing the same, especially after I had told him I was working until 9pm last night. So. I had a bit of brekkie, had a lie in for a bit, listened to the radio, took the post in. Just a like a day at work really.   I have also discovered that the scally next door plays his dreadful "music" (it was Nellie today) just as loud in the daytime as he does in the evening ("bom, boom, boom..."). Also, that The Boy does not let daylight ruin his slumber until after midday.  I have now finally finished the document ready for running it by the Director. (I have added quite a lot of things which sound very good but I expect he'll rip it to shreds) &nbsp;It's one o'clock and the whole of today's work is done. I think I will award myself the&nbsp;afternoon off. The sun is shining, the seagulls are calling. I think I will retire to the pub on the harbour for some BEER.&nbsp; mmmmm

      A Busy Day &nbsp; A 7.30 start gets me to the Citizens Advice Bureau in Torquay for an 8 o'clock&nbsp;meeting about their proposed new building in Paignton. They would like my input on accessibility and I find myself co-opted onto their steering group for what could be a million pound project. Wow. How did I walk into that one?  A short walk back to the office and I get summoned by the Director to discuss the Directorate's "Equalities Policy", which is basically non-existent. The result is that I have committed myself to writing it. Ouch! Then, straight into a Team Meeting which drags on, but we all seem to be doing pretty well. My colleague has a policy of upsetting a local Transport Consultant which seems to be working and makes us all happy as they are a manipulative and aggressive bunch. We are helping them get a bad reputation with developers, which can't be bad at all. The boss refuses to stay focussed on the meeting and keeps rambling off on one of his stories, each time my other colleague (whose turn it is to chair the meeting) invites him to speak. Together we keep him in order, but I don't think he's too impressed when I say "fooocussss, Pete, foooccuussss". Then I rush out to get M's car, put the roof down (of course) and come back to collect 7 boxes of Access Guides (newly received, free to us, funded by advertising) for delivery to Torquay Museum, Living Coasts ("See Penguins Fly"), and the Shopmobilities in Torquay, Paignton and Brixham. Only 24 more boxes to get rid of. Returning the car to the car park, I rush to the station to catch the 13.29 train (afternoon booked off) to get back for Computer Repair Man, who takes an hour and a half investigating why BT Broadband wont work on my new Router Modem (so me and the boy can both get Broadband on the same phone line). It seems BT insert some text that demands the Broadband can only be accessed using BT's kit. A cunning commercial wheeze that hopefully tomorrow he can overcome. He has also discovered that, by using BT Broadband, we have opened ourselves to widespread internet abuse by advertising when we are on the internet (alledgedly), something the firewall didnt pick up. "A seive" he said. hmmm. Thanks for fixing that! In the meantime, The Girl (and the daughter, and I will have to update her to the "Young Woman") and The Boy are supposed to be off to visit their mother, who is holidaying in Suffolk next week. This involves a train journey to Ipswich from Devon. The Girl's phone call and the Mother's phone call to the Ticket booking line both end in an Indian or East European call centre which can't recognise the trip as a valid journey and can't offer anything except single journeys, at vast expense (we are looking at over 100 pounds each, each&nbsp;way!). I walked down to the station but the ticket office has just closed. I try the local train company customer service and the man there, who I could almost literally see raise his eyes to the heavens when I mention the call centres, advises me of a suitable time and price and suggests I ring Great Western who will provide the bulk of the trip. I do this, they answer first ring and are very helpful. There are no really cheap tickets left but there are some Not&nbsp;Too Expensive ones. I pass this advice to my ex, who successfully books them (why should I pay? She wants them to go to Suffolk). Hooray. And now, it is time for tea. Made by me. As usual. A&nbsp;

      A Grand Day Out &nbsp; The Girl and her daughter came up this morning, as invited, and we caught the train to Newton to visit "Air Fusion", an annual event featuring local bands held in the park by the station. All very low key at noon time but we expect it gets busier later. Melissa, who is 16 months old is&nbsp;not really old enough for&nbsp;any of it,&nbsp;meanders over the entire area following whatever takes her fancy, adult in tow. Strawberries are her great favourite at the moment so we all come away with various pink stains that she has deposited. More interesting is the little kiddie park outside, which at least has swings. &nbsp; Lunch followed at&nbsp;a nearby pub, where fortunately Little One fell asleep leaving us in peace to discuss the world, and whether the Girl could afford to run a car if she could a find one. With her own efforts at saving, and help from her (exceedingly rich) mother, and maybe the promised contribution of an excess car from her grandparents, it would give her some independence and get her out of the flat more often, even taking her to see her friends and do her own shopping. When Little One is&nbsp;older there might even be camping.&nbsp;We shall see whether she is able to make the savings she plans (I know you are reading this, my love), but I am sure getting a job might be more helpful in the long run. When you have a young child, having a car opens new worlds of things you can see and do, so I hope it all works out. And hopefully not too much at my expense because I hope I have done my bit. Well, OK, there will always be more, and who can resist that Little One, who can say narna, and BEER, already. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      A Lovely Fete &nbsp; Having collected the car from car hospital this morning, and handed over the keys to my house to pay for it (why isn't there a car NHS?), we did the shopping in regular non supermarket style (walking round and round town, going back to shops where we'd missed things, or had to return to as the shopping was too heavy). Kath at the greengrocers is retiring and moving back to Birmingham to be near her Grand kids (the ultimate sacrifice!). After lunch we drove to the edge of Dartmoor to do a lovely cache by a reservoir (I was careful not to pee in the reservoir, because ultimately it comes out of the taps at home. Constructed by Torbay Borough Council in 1907). We then stumbled upon a village fete at Bridford,&nbsp;a village on a No Through Road, so never visited. After a couple in the pub, we strolled down to the fete, which was in the grounds of the Old Rectory and very posh it was too. An enormous refurbished Victorian House, and acres of lawn and field. Lots of stalls&nbsp;selling plants, cakes, books etc, kiddies games, guess where the wine comes from, donkey rides, a cow to touch. Everybody appeared very moneyed. No farmers with weird facial hair and check jackets, no oiks, all just very naice. Strangely, all the stalls were amazingly cheap. Boxes of old books for a £1, an old fashioned clamp-on mincer for 10p, a pith helmet for 10p, a soft toy polar bear for 10p. Just stuff that normally you would be paying far more for, even in a charity shop. Seems they didnt really need the money. Lucky people in that part of the country. M said it was her perfect weekend day out so that was good. Glad to see her happy. A&nbsp;

       It's a Funny Old Job   &nbsp;  Today, I have done a variety of things at work, none of which appear to have much in common with each other.  First thing I attended a "Transport Briefing Meeting" with councillors and officers. I was sitting in for my boss who normally makes notes of proceedings. Therefore it was I that had to take the minutes (I also had a paper to present but, what the heck?). They discussed this and that: parking for motorcaravans; a busy roundabout; a footpath that the hospital put a building across; The Local Transport Plan Annual Progress Report; a couple of petitions received from various gruntled and disgruntled members of the public; making a one way street, two way. A mundane selection, I am sure you will agree. After that I escorted the lead councillor to the design office where he checked the final draft of the Annual Progress Report. The front cover is a gem, in my opinion: a photo of 21 brand new accessible double decker buses lined up on Paignton sea front. A bit of a coup for this area which tends to be neglected, transport-wise.&nbsp; I would have put a picture in here but I cant make that picasa stuff work. Doh! After that, I printed off the forms for a review of my colleague's probation period, dropping a spurious and unlikely copy of my comments on her desk. That'll gee her up when she come back Tuesday morning.  &nbsp;  Lunch with the newspaper and BEER was pleasant.  &nbsp;  I fielded calls from Shopmobility, where I am the boss; sent off an email with a list of parks I want assessed for disabled access; another to Notwork Rail asking when a local railway footbridge would be repaired (it's only been nearly 3 years since some intelligent and well adjusted citizen tried to burn it down); discussed with a colleague the installation of CCTV at the same railway station (we've had the cameras sitting in a cupboard for two years waiting permission to put them up)&nbsp;and received a box of leaflets which I had written and commissioned&nbsp;for lorry drivers showing which roads we would like them to stick to. Now I have to organise getting them distributed.  &nbsp;  I am also guiltily putting off looking at the department's "equality policy", which when compared to the other departments' policies is brief and fairly incomprehensible. In fact it&nbsp;IS brief and incomprehensible even without being compared to other directorates' policies. Oh well next week.  &nbsp;  A bit of a mixture, and if I didnt do some of it, no-one would at all.  &nbsp;  That sort of sounds like I do a lot but, actually, I think I spent most of the day skiving and looking forward to the weekend.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The Boy is Back  He has returned. Arrived back safely at Gatwick late last night, they were collected successfully by my dad and then dropped off at Fleet services this morning to arrive back this afternoon. I dont know much about what they did, but they watched no TV, had breakfast at the same cafe each morning, ate either lunch or supper at a restaurant, and visited Barcelona and Taragona. He jumped off a cliff into the sea, and was just getting into being at the beach when it was time to come home. He spent most of his money. I tried contacting him on his phone but it appeared to stay off all the time, so it is a relief he is back safely. Not that I would have nagged him, but it is a relief that he is back. Even if he is a fairly non communicative teenager (ie I have to squeeze info about his holiday from him). What he doesn't know yet is that M has just booked a week in Crete for the 3 of us. She didnt actually tell me until after she had booked it. I didnt even know she had been to the travel agents. I am assuming that as I didnt know (I really didnt, I thought we were staying in Devon in August), that I won't have to pay for it. Won't that be nice? As far as holidays are concerned, nobody seems to talk to me. A

Your baseball cap will be shredded and used to stuff cushions.  Section 3c All vehicles towing caravans are forbidden from all public roads between the hours of 6am and midnight.

      Sharing a sand-bar with a Brazilian  Off to Cornwall we go. Due to the rubbish weather, we checked in at the hotel and went off for a lovely evening in the pub, The Logan Rock at Treen. None of us fancied an evening of Shakespeare at the Minack theatre was about 400 yards from the hotel, preferring to drink lots of BEER instead. Friday morning, we went to the campsite and pitched our tents and went for more BEER at the same pub. Then we purchased the makings of a picnic, including more BEER and made our way down to the local beach, where we have been many times and where the ashes of M's mother and grandfather were strewn from a local rock. I had with me my new camping chair which was very comfy and a lot better than sitting on the sand getting gritty. As the sun moved round I had to keep moving out of the shadow of the cliff. I the end, I moved the chair to the waters edge, where I fancied myself as some sort of Dirk Bogarde figure in the film "Death in Venice". Others fancied I looked a bit of a loony. Time will tell when the photos come.  Later, I paddled out to the sand bar that forms as the tide goes out. There were only two other people on the sandbar, a woman and child. I didnt speak to them, but I could tell she was Brazilian. What I havent said, and I hadn't known before,and no, we didnt participate, is that this has become a nudist beach, mostly populated by wrinkly people, but by a very few younger people. That's how I could tell that this woman on the sand bar was Brazilian. I'm sure some of them were in the pub later but I didnt recognise them with their clothes on. A

      Camping In a Gale  It's still raining, it's windy and cold. The boot is packed full of camping gear, our bags are packed. Destination: a bleak makeshift campsite in a field overlooking the Atlantic Ocean in the far south west of Cornwall, a destination favoured by M and I even before we met. I have packed the wellington boots, as is traditional for July camping, plus extra blankets and woolly jumpers. And hats and scarves.  Certain people, not hardened in the ways of camping in the Cornish countryside in July, are having second thoughts.   Contingency plans are formed. Telephone calls made. Certain rash promises are made. Alas No Room At The Inn. Or at the second choice. Someone is made to search the internet. A large Victorian pile overlooking the Minack open-air theatre is selected. And Bob's your uncle. A lovely hotel booked for M and I and her sister and her partner. The camping gear is still in the car, but hey? What's the chances of getting M to pay for a second night too?

      ODing(1) on jargon and initials.  Today I half invited myself (no-one else would go) to a meeting in Exeter with the SRA(2). I arrived late as I had got the start time wrong and had erroneously chosen a short term P&D(3) space from which I had to remove my car. They talked about RUS(4) and CUS(5) for the GW(6) region. The people from DCC(7) and the RA(8) talked about RSS(9) and RPG(10). Certain matters needed to be taken to the RATOSG(11) (pronounced Ratsog). I really think I was the wrong person to attend. My boss plus one above him should have attended. Coming home early (and I couldn't be bothered to drive past my house and back to Torquay to the office). I tried to overcome the problems caused by getting Broadband (and I know I have mentioned this before). BT(12) have kindly supplied a modem and I have successfully connected. In order to get the boy's PC on Broadband too, and to eliminate having to pay for dial up (and I won't know who my phone provider is if I get rid of NTL(13) dial up), I have purchased a router/modem and a length of network cable (ADSL)(14). The BT software can't/won't cope with this so if I try to use the router, the software won't connect with the internet. I hope the local computer shop will help out (they have before). I hope all I need is to fiddle around with the background progamming stuff and alter a line of text somewhere. Then when he comes back from Spain, the Boy will have a nice new Broadband connection to his bedroom. He deserves it, even though I don't know if he is even still alive after, hopefully, jetting off yesterday. My IBS(15) today has been so horrid, I haven't known what to do with myself. I have been to the WC(16) well over a dozen times, and the pressure has finally eased off at about 5pm(17). I feel nearly normal, and a couple of beers have helped. I won't moan but it can really get you down. Gales and rain! And who is going camping in Cornwall tomorrow? Us. That's right. The wettest and windiest part of the country. It's only 100 miles from here but it has gradually got worse here all day. Looking outside, the sky is brightening and the rain has stopped. I hope that this will new weather will reach all you folks up country soon. The sea is still grey with white rollers though.

      Empty Nest  Well. It's finally happened. The Boy has left on his Spanish Holiday. Paid for and generally organised by him. The house is quiet. No supper is being prepared in a hurry, because he has forgotten to tell me he is working toninght. M is still at work, slaving away on an 80 page document that my team have given her for emergency publication.  The Boy has gone to the Costa Brava with his mate Megan. He's had plenty of practice at foreign holidays. Me and him have travelled from Helsinki to Teignmouth by overland public transport (I got one more passport stamp than him, somehow. I can still get "wind-up" mileage out of that). We have travelled Spain and Morocco together. We have had holidays in Greece and Turkey and France with M.  This time, though, he is on his own. Him and his mate Megs are in charge. They arranged a lift to Gatwick with her brother because it was cheaper than the train (especially as I seem to be collecting the fuel cost), and this morning they went. The only nod to adult support is that my dad is, hopefully, collecting them from Gatwick next Tuesday. At midnight. (Thanks, dad). They are probably touching down at Girona at this minute.  I have bought that Boy up, in the absence of his mother, since he was 9 months old (with the help of Au Pair X4, M#1 (harumph) and the wonderful M#2).  One hour after he was presumed to have left the house, I checked to make sure they were on their way alright. His phone was turned off. I think independence has arrived (And it's very quiet). My Mothering Days are nearly through.  A

      Technermology  First my mobile packed up and refused to restart. It took days of negotiating with the phone co and their local shop for them to replace it. The fact that the shop is 15 miles away didnt help. I'd also managed to save all my numbers to the phone, not the SIM, so every single number I'd saved to the phone was lost.  No sooner had I got that sorted then the PC decided not to accept the CD to install Broadband. So the PC had to go away, along with the printer which was also U/S (funny how they pack up just after the warranty expires).  In the meantime I purchased a "router" to link mine and the Boy's PC to the microwave thingy. Trouble is, the BT software only likes it's own modem and not the router's. If there is any help out there, please let me know.  Broadband is successfully installed, however, if only on this PC. Not sure it makes any difference  CNPS stats: 19

      Cardiff/Caerdydd  On the train to a conference in Cardiff today. Somehow, I couldn’t read the clock this morning and ran down to the station as the train arrived and the departed. Rousing M from the bath, I collected my keys and drove to Exeter, where I watched my connecting train depart as I arrived on the platform. The following train arrived in Bristol to catch my 3rd train by the skin of my teeth.  On arrival in Cardiff, and being overcome by the grandeur of the city, and the size of the Millenium Stadium, I decided that exploring Cardiff was more important than any rotten old conference. What a lovely city it is, with the stadium, the civic hall and the other lovely buildings. A proper capital city (something, I feel, that Dublin, for instance, lacks).  Why not a trip to Barry Island, to pass the time? Lovely journey on the train through some heavy industry and some areas busily trying to regenerate themselves. So much derelict and, and forgotten heritage. Odd bits of railway leading down to forgotten dockyards. The train screeches and squeals round to the terminus which gives the appearance of arrival at a long neglected part of the east end of London. There are two massive resort/funfair things there, both of which appeared to be closed (This is July, for invisible friend’s sake!). It felt like the end of the world and also very Welsh: the tables and chairs in the elegant Art Deco style pub were all in a rows, something I have noticed before about Welsh pubs. A few groups of school kids were sitting in the sun, but apart from that, there was a general air of decline and lost glory. Lovely views though. Back in Cardiff, the announcements were all in Welsh then English, although I am not convinced anyone could actually understand the Welsh bits. Blah blah blah First Great Western blah blah blah Llundain Paddington blah blah blah.  No disrespect to any Welsh speakers but I wonder how useful it actually is. At least they try.

      I had a friend but we fell out   I met this guy at Uni and we became good friends. He was a year older and doing an interminably long Masters which he strung out for years. We went our own ways: I got married and had children, he set off on his travels and a series of relationships which he couldn’t sustain (I can talk, my marriage ended, as did my second long term relationship. Just slower motion, that’s all). All this time, he was travelling, smuggling, taking stuff, a bit of a wanderer. He made enough (more than enough) money, through various dubious deals, to buy a nice flat in Battersea, where he smoked dope and played his music loud, while being a social worker. I visited often, and he always nagged me to travel. I never felt I could as all the time I was bringing up my children, and trying to maintain a long term relationship with my ex wife and my other ex. (We were such good friends that he knew my ex-wife was seeing someone else before I did). He had no responsibilities and no children. Eventually, he persuaded me to go to Helsinki with him, to travel back overland. (Originally it was St Petersburg, for which I paid the money for visas. I also got the plane fares). We agreed that I took my lad, then 15, could come. We met at Liverpool Street and went up to Stansted. We had a few beers. Arriving at a freezing Helsinki, we found the Youth Hostel easily. We then went to find a bar which would allow a 15 year old in. Job done, he insisted on more drinks, while not bothering to get any markka. This seemed a trifle odd as he was always well off. He wanted to get away to Estonia the next day but I wanted to look around Helsinki first. I offered to meet him a day later, but this, and a comment from me that paying for everything (visas, flights, hostel, drinks) seemed to be a one-way street, set him off. He insulted the people in the bar, he wiped the Boy’s hat in spilt hot chocolate and was generally nasty, threatening and paranoid. Having enough of this I took the boy back to the hostel. He returned shortly after, whining that I had left him alone with no money (was that my fault?). He started punching me in front of the Boy who by this time was really frightened. My arms hung by my sides. I went to reception to ask for a new room and was offered a choice of return to room or Police. Blood was flowing, so Police it was. In the mean time, he had "barricaded" the room with all the wooden furniture, so I didn’t look a complete dickhead when the armed police arrived. We slept in an already occupied dormitory elsewhere and in the morning, we watched him walk off alone. I have never seen him again. The Boy and I toured Helsinki, in the freezing cold (the effin sea was frozen in Helsinki), to give him a head start. Then we headed home overland to Calais. He wrote to me once, saying he now had a child, and was working part time so he could be at home to look after it. I wrote back, but never received a reply. I don’t like to push it. The Boy wouldn’t approve: who likes to see his dad getting smacked up? I do miss him though. An old friend isn’t like an ex lover. I’d like to see him one day. But I don’t know if I forgive him or if he has forgiven me.

      Family Weekend  I met the kids at Liverpool Street Station, after their brief trip to their mum's. H had got quite upset with her mum who refused to take them into Ipswich (train to London every 15 minutes) and took them to the local station (train every two hours) , got the times wrong, and generally caused them to be 3 hours later getting back to Devon ("Oh it doesn't matter if you are a couple of hours late for work, dear". It bleedin does if you get paid by the hour and could easily get the sack for not showing up. It's all very well if you capture (sorry, marry) a millionaire and have never had a proper job in your life but other people have to work. Great fun spending extra hours travelling with a 16 month old baby with you, too).  Anyway, I met them and the four of us travelled across to Paddington, where it was a long wait for the next train west. It was also a very popular tain, resulting in the boy and I standing from Reading to Taunton. Anyway, I was very proud how my little extended family coped. Later, H and her little one rejoined M, the Boy and I and some chums to watch the carnival. There's a line in Neil and Tim Finn's current single about "everyone that I love being all in the same place" (or something) and it was like that. I was quite overcome.  Saturday too M and I to the beach to watch the gig racing (rowing) and our friend's boat came second. H and the little one joined us and we took Little One off to play on the beach. I must admit it is the first time I have buried a baby up her neck in sand. She seemed to enjoy it though. Usual mess with ice-cream after. Happy baby rinsing for her mum to do after (sand and icecream).  Sunday, two free tickets took us to the zoo. H and Little One came along. The Tiger was hiding, the gorillas and heffalumps are quite smelly. I suspect Little One is too young for the zoo. It is quite difficult to stand 6 feet from 3/4 tonne of bison and be more interested in the rock on the ground, but she managed it. Apart from that, Paignton Zoo is a good way to spend 3 hours. During our visit, the boy rang asking me to drive 10 miles to pick him up because his bike had broken and he was 2 miles from home. Naturally, I declined (suggesting a taxi)  and felt bad for the rest of the visit. When we got home, the bike appeared to have fixed it self, thus demonstrating the benefits of firm parenting.   No internet at home currently so limited time at work.
