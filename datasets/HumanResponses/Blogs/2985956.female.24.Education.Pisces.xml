       WHY I REFUSE TO WATCH BET, YET MUST CHECK IN EVERY NOW AND THEN TO VERIFY THAT SUCH A PROTEST IS NECESSARY   last night around 22.45 or so, i was in bed flipping through channels searching for something to capture my limited attention span, when something that appeared to be a greek stepshow gave me pause.  halting my thumb exercises for the moment, my suspicions were immediately confirmed.  quickly, i wondered:  who could be televising a stepshow at this hour?  it couldn't be mtv's true life:  i'm going to freaknik; according to my mental cable rolodex, they had stopped showing reruns of that episode quite sometime ago.  and it definitely wasn't vh1, for lately their programmers seemed only to possess the ability to televise "the fabulous life of the hilton sisters," and "awesomely bad hair."  (to vh1's credit, i must add that they did recently rerun that whitney houston special which i, being the whitney and bobby fan that i am [more on that some other time], greatly appreciate.)  it must be that i'm watching, i concluded with great dismay, BET!!!    now i am proudly anti-BET.  but anyone who's a bonafide __fill in your own tv channel here__ hater knows that you have to check in every now and then to make sure that your "activism" still has a purpose; and believe me, when you watch as much tv as i do, intentionally  not   watching a particular station  is  activism.  what if, for example, BET had actually become worthy of the words from which its acronym derives?  i had to make sure i still had a reason to be mad.  one good thing i can say about BET:  it never lets a sista down;  it always gives me some shit to be mad about.  this stepshow was a segment from "college hill," apparently the first "black" reality tv show in history.  i remembered that my friend, candace mentioned it a while ago, but i had yet to actually see it.  here was my chance.  ok, ok, lemme get to the point...  well, i guess if you're going to be a black reality show, you gotta talk about fried chicken, right?  and you better believe that was the topic of discussion during the segment i saw.  see, this stepshow was a part of a certain hbcu's homecoming festivities (apparently, "college hill" is set on the campus of southern university, hence the show's name....duh).  anyway, after a performance by the hip hop group youngbloodz, we see some of the cast of the show hanging out backstage.  one of the female characters is pregnant; several people are shown touching and talking to her stomach.  watching this, i said aloud, "goooooooooooddamn."  here we have, on BLACK ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION, the first all black reality show on air, set on the campus of an historically african american institution of higher learning, and one of the cast members is visibly very pregnant, hanging out backstage at a rap concert like a doggone groupie.  now that's what i call black entertainment!!!    need i say more?  ok, i will.  where in the hell is the NAACP?  oh yeah, they're giving IMAGE awards (jesus h. christ!!)  to mo'nique for her work on "the parkers," and queen latifah (she's my girl and i love her, but i gotta go here) for "bringing down the house"...wasn't r. kelly nominated?  i know mfume made the move to  keep nominations "in house", but the damage has been done.  if there's such a paucity of responsible portrayals of african americans in the media, then don't give out awards... you mean to tell me that jesse jackson--who got his drawers all in a bundle about "barber shop"--is mum?  yet i am to resist criticizing black leadership?  sheesh!!!   but i digress.  back to the chicken...  so this same pregnant woman in those "commentary segments" that always accompany these reality shows, continues to mention how she keeps taking chicken--which was apparently for the performers--from backstage.  the segment went something like this:  a bunch of black people backstage, cut to pregnant woman saying something like, "i took some chicken and a bottle of water."  back to some other black people backstage, cut back to p.w., "i took some chicken from them too.  i guess i shoulda felt bad, but the chicken was good."  another shot of black people backstage with voice over commentary saying that this rather large black guy--who is apparently also a cast member--had the audacity to eat some of the food intended for tyrese, another performer.  that food, of course, was chicken.  i guess we can at least be happy that they didn't show anyone actually eating the chicken.  there was, however, a watermelon seed spitting contest...just kidding.  was it necessary to dedicate the entire last segment of a black reality show to chicken?  were there not enough black women to choose from that were not pregnant? must the first black reality show on television look like my eighth grade basketball games my dad recorded on our old skool camcorder?  will there ever come a time when i'll have to watch BET for more than 15 minutes in order to get mad?  granted, i only saw the last fifteen minutes, but i'm not willing to bet my spring quarter's stipend that it was any better.  i wish i could just blame viacom, but (un)fortunately, the show is produced by kenneth "babyface" edmonds and his wife, the folks who brought us the movie, "soul food."  now perhaps i should give babyface a break.  after all, he does have lenny kravitz envy, and kravitz wasn't even picked up by the black team during the racial draft on "chappelle's show."  what's most devastating to me is that it's also produced by chrisopher scott cherot, the dude who wrote and directed "hav plenty"--the movie i spent most of my undergraduate years watching incessantly for no apparent reason other than 1) i was too cheap to buy a copy of "coming to america," and 2) perhaps it speaks to me in the same way alanis morrisette speaks to my cohort, shannon.  now cherot and babyface's wife are light-skinned, and babyface, as mentioned above, models himself after someone who was drafted by the jewish team, but for all intents and purposes, these folks--let's remember the edmonds' appearance on mtv's "cribs," where babyface proudly showed that his family kept kool-aid packets in their pantry in order to show that they were indeed still a black family, you know "keepin' it real"-- are black.  shouldn't they be producing something a little bit more, um,   responsible ?    i'm just sayin'... we just can't blame the man anymore can we black people?    maybe i should just stop watching tv.  i will now step off of my soapbox.  thank you for your attention.   next time: omarosa (yeah, goddamnit.  i watch the apprentice, too.)  later.    does anybody read this shit?

      ok, right.  so i just went through all this signing up stuff, and now have nothing to say.  ain't that some shit?  this is much harder than i anticipated.  i just got caught up in the sexiness of the idea of expressing myself publicly i suppose.     i'd never heard of these blogs until last night when a fellow graduate student mentioned that several other students in the department actually maintained these online "journals."  being the follower that i am, i immediately created my own account with, unfortunately, nothing really important to say.  peer pressure is such a bitch.    i'm supposed to be writing an abstract.  later.

       WHEN RACISM AIN'T REALLY RACISM, AND OTHER REASONS WHY MY PEOPLE OCCASIONALLY GET ON MY NERVES...(WARNING!  THIS BLOG IS ESPECIALLY INARTICULATE)   unabashedly, every thursday night i watch the apprentice.  granted, i understand that the whole donald trump aspect--among other things--means that i should not be addicted to this show, but i am.  and would you know that the donald played me?  yes, folks, he played me.  now...as a, um, racialized viewer, when watching gameshows and whatnot, i root for the black people.  i don't know why, i just do.  perhaps i believe that if they win somehow that's a credit to the race or whatever, but what's important here is that i am generally inclined to back the colored folks.  that was, until i started watching the apprentice.  omarosa.  sweet jesus!!!  i knew my whole "raced viewer" theory was going straight to hell when i saw the first episode.  introducing herself, she stood in front of the capitol--or some other government building in dc--arms crossed proudly saying some shit like, "i'm omarosa, and i'm from the projects."  wtf?    for the six or so weeks she was on the show, she proceeded to get on my--and every other viewer in america--last nerve.  one episode in particular, she called a white female contestant racist after, according to how the scene was constructed, this contestant said to omarosa, "that's the pot calling the kettle black."  now we all know that that phrase has no racial origins.  so at the time, omarosa just continued to irk me.    once omarosa was "fired" last week, she started making the rounds on the talkshow circuit.  on the view, she revealed that her cry of racism was not a response to the "pot" but to the "n" word.  this part, according to omarosa, had been edited out.  not to be outdone, ericka (the white contestant who believed that omarosa was indicting her as a racist) showed up on the view the next day to defend herself.  now...i'm not going to say who i believe.  but i will say that occasionally i think my folks cry racism when it ain't really racism.  so...i have decided to provide several examples of when something may be a racist statment or have racial undertones, and when it may not be, in order to prevent future confusion:  1) not racist/racial:  someone (not af am) who you don't know very well, say at an english department gathering, asks you to dance.     racist/racial:  someone (not af am) who you don't know very well, say at this same english department gathering, asks you to teach them how to dance.  2)  not racist/racial: in the midst of a conversation tells you they went to a restaurant and at some point mentions that the restaurant was a soul food restaurant.      racist/racial: tells you that they had the best fried chicken and collard greens last night, and y'all weren't even talking about food, or even talking at all. (that actually happened to me.)  3)  not racist/racial:  while reciting a rap song someone  fails to bleep out "nigga" (in your presence).      racist/racial:  in greeting you says, "whatup nigga?", as if they forgot the historical connotation of non-blacks using that term.  **caveat:  occasionally people say inappropriate things to be funny, but essentially just come off as insensitive assholes.  i'm not advocating violence, but i do support humiliating them in such a way that is educational.  stank you smelly much

       IT'S NOT LIKE I SOLD THE KID CRACK...REFLECTIONS ON THE APPRENTICE   kwame and bill in the board room fighting for the job.  trump asks, "bill, why should i pick you?"  bill says, "because of the blood running in my veins."  hmm...now what could that mean?  are you, dear bill, saying, you deserve to win because you are white?  a good old boy who got the task of running an exclusive country club while kwame gets stuck being in charge of a jessica simpson concert.  interesting.  i f*****g omarosa's guts...she sold a brother out.  why is it that during the opening credits kwame goes from looking quite serious to smiling?  what's that all about?  scared of a black man looking threatening, i guess...  omarosa is crazy.  kwame is so professional.  did i mention that omarosa is crazy?  wow... i love ericka...she called omarosa a liar while sitting right next to her.  nick is the most boring reality tv show peronality ever.  did i mention that omarosa was crazy?  whatever shall i do now that i no longer have a thursday night show to watch?  that is all.

       WHY I HAVEN'T BEEN WRITING LATELY...AND MORE REASONS WHY BLACK PEOPLE ON TV GET ON MY DAMN NERVES.   spring has sprung which means, in my dismal ass life, that the final quarter of the skool year has commenced.  this is my last quarter of coursework as a player hating degree student, which basically means that after june, i will become further isolated from reality, and fully (re)incorpated into yoknapatawpha county.  that said, i must somehow muster up the courage to ask professors to be part of my orals committee.  it sounds simple, but this shit is big.  i mean, it's kinda like proposing, asking someone to participate in making the relationship more intimate.  i mean, basically you're going to be hounding the prof for that whole entire hour of office hours they offer you...the fields go something like, major:  late 19th-early 20th century american (basically from twain to faulkner with a little james, cather, wharton, and negroes in between); minor:  late 20th century american; minor:  race theory from like the colonization of the country now known as the US to post Civil Rights movement.      anyway...back to the apprentice.  it's the season finale this week.  apparently this is an affirmative action television show, as kwame is part of the final two.  big ups to the donald.  i mean, he could be like all those other reality tv shows who have people of color on just for show.   like, does anyone really believe that the bachelor is  really  gonna pick a sister?  of course not.  but i digress.  last time, i gave omarosa a whole bunch a shit for being a big fat liar; her dishonesty was confirmed on the oprah show, but that's another blog.  yet, it would be entirely unfair if i didn't give kwame a lot of shit, and boy does the apprentice give me ammunition.  1) how many times do i need to see kwame's package through his boxers?  everyone else answers the phone either fully clothed or with a robe on.  yet i must consistently receive the network tv full frontal whenever kwame receives a message from trump's secretary.  2)  is he the only male who does pull ups in his off time?  good lord, if i see this mofo exercising in a wife beater one more time.  ATTENTION EDITORS:  SLOW MOTION IS HARDLY A NOVEL TECHNOLOGY.    3)  episode planet hollywood:  now, normally i don't do this but uh...i was at medici the other week with rachel and salinda--along with other members of the department--and somehow, after discussing faulkner kitsch and tag team orals exams, talked about this particular episode of the apprentice.  this one aired during the earlier part of the season when the men were getting their asses kicked.  on the day that the men managed planet hollywood, they had issues with getting patrons to come into the restaurant.  to counter this, they decided rustle up some business by having an auction.  yeah, i said it, auction.  see, this whole have kwame jackson sign your basketball thing was doubly offensive.  first, in order to drum up business, this nigga was willing to forsake the name drop ("i have an mba from harvard") and pretend to be a basketball player.  when asked by trump if he lied, dude simply responded, "no, i just told them that i was kwame jackson from charlotte, north carolina."  yeah, unh hunh.  all those little white kids from bloomington, illinois visiting the big city for the first time thought you worked on wall street, hence the reason why they purchased a basketball in the planet hollywood giftstore and subsequently had you sign it.  now if that wasn't bad enough, kwame's boy troy somehow got ahold of a microphone and started yelling on the streets of new york, trying to get people to come see kwame jackson.  why is that problematic?  well...1) troy is white, and 2) he has this accent that, although he's from idaho**, sounds southern.   now i'm not saying that it was a slave auction, i'm just saying that it was scarily reminiscent of one, and hence was in bad taste.  i thought they taught stuff like how to recognize the racial components of certain situations at harvard.  of course, should i really be looking for ethics and more intelligent decisions on a reality tv show that is so capitalistically driven?  yeah...my bad.   **let me also extend my issues with the narcissistic ass new yorkers on tv, who, in the following case, seem to represent the attitude of the city's populous.  IDAHO IS NOT A SOUTHERN STATE!!!  look, i know new york is an amazing place, and you should be proud to live/be from there.  but that doesn't mean that your ignorance about the rest of the country is validated by your arrogance about your city.  i mean, dude, saying shit that not so subtly implies that there's no other place worth knowing other than new york is just pretty stupid, and further shows that you didn't pay much attention in geography class.  you should really just know where other states--and countries, maybe-- are (besides new jersey and connecticut).  so then hopefully, when you mention that someone is from the south that they're actually from the south, and not, say, from idaho.  that is all.   anyway, i'll be in the bathroom lamenting over the rumor that whitney and bobby are splitting up.

       IN SEARCH OF MORE MIND POLLUTION...WHY I NEED TELEVISION   i realize that i'm going to have to talk about my dismal ass life now that the apprentice is over.  because of this, dear reader (i learned how to address the reader like that from stowe), i apologize.  yet to keep this blog going, i must write with some relative consistency.  so...  yesterday while trying to avoid finishing the blithedale romance,  i got on  urlLink friendster  and started looking up people i used to know.  so the first name i put in was this woman i'd gone to school with since maybe elementary school.  i remember being like best friends with her in 2nd grade or something;later, in 8th grade once i'd transferred schools, she ended up sitting behing me in our honors english class.  then, during my junior year in high school, we saw each other in the halls, but you know, by then we were running in different circles.  the conundrum is as follows, do i send her a little message saying something like, "hi.  i don't know if you remember me, and i know we haven't talked in 50 years, but i was looking through my high skool yearbook, and came across your picture.  i put your name in the  urlLink friendster  search engine, and bam!  there you were.  how about we catch up?"  i guess i feel like this kinda breaks that "here's my number, but don't call me rule."  i mean, do people really look up old pals and genuinely try to reconnect?  would i be forced to reminisce on things i have no desire to recall?  like, i just want to say hi. do i run the risk of feeling required to continue to be on speaking terms with someone i used to know in my former life?  basically i resist doing this because it would publically acknowledge how lame i am, and i don't want to have to deal with that.  my private humiliation will suffice.  i have no desire to readily admit to anyone who knows me outside of this blog that i am bored enough to google the name of old high skool mates during my free time.    granted, this over the top trepidation i have about something so simple is contingent upon the idea that there is a public which holds an opinion of me.  which means, i suppose, that i actually believe that there are those who think highly (or lowly) of me in such away that allows them to spend time and brains cells considering me.    i have thought myself into paralysis.  what narcissism!!!  damn, i need a tv show to bitch about.

       TIP DRILLS, SPELMANITES, ETC...OR, E'RYBODY GOTTA PRICE, SOME ARE JUST LOWER THAN OTHERS   (i really like parentheses.  they rock... but  before i bitch about something else i saw on tv, i just wanna give a shout out to anne's friend who reads my blog.  honestly, i didn't think anyone read it, but now that i know that i have at least one reader, i'll try to blog more frequently.  perhaps i'll even make the writing better.  but what's important here, i suppose, is that i'll have to start watching tv again.)  before my abstinence from television began, i happened to catch BET uncut, a show i used to watch back during my insomniac days.  basically, it's a video show that airs all the nasty, raunchy videos that they don't show during the day.  while watching it, candace (she wrote her b.a. on this video girl issue) and i would talk over the phone to each other, analyzing the music videos while making snides ass remarks and other comments we called "cultural criticism."  the show compelled us to consider possibly getting a cable access show where we recorded segments of shows from television, and supplied a voice over of our thoughts.  anyway, it was the only show on BET i allowed myself to watch.  i suppose i enjoyed being appalled.  anyway, a couple of months ago, i caught the show for the first time in a while.  and i saw the now infamous nelly video, "tip drill."  shocking.  now i'm from indiana, the basketball and corn state.  my understanding of the term tip drill is completely affiliated with basketball.  there are no basketballs in this particular video.  (apparently, the term "tip drill" is one that describes a female who has a nice body, but unattractive face.  i don't get it.  maybe i should think harder.)  there is, however, a scene where nelly, or another one of those thug rapper guys (i got that line from a cee-lo song; i'm not really calling them thug rapper guys), takes a credit card and slides it up the crack of a woman's ass.  (i thought in a later scene that this same woman had given him a receipt, but i found out it was just toilet paper... j/k)  hmmm.  altough there are other things to complain about and protest (women dancing on women for the pleasure of men,thongs, etc.), this whole credit card garbage was most appalling.     in the spirit of having some damn respect for themselves and others, the women of spelman college (atlanta, ga.) recently protested a scheduled visit to the campus by nelly.  apparently the emcee intended on coming in order to fundraise for his organization that helps kids get bone marrow transplants (4sho4kids) that he started because his sister (yeah, he has a sister) needed one.  nelly, upon hearing about potential acrimonious interactions with the student body (no pun intended...well, maybe it is), decided not to show.    as a result, there was a meeting held on spelman's campus in response to this clip, as well as the overall denigration of women in music videos.  responses ranged from 'it's not like they forced her to do it,' from a morehouse student (is anyone surprised?), to these rappers need to be more responsible.  BET, of course, refuses to not air the video, or cancel the show.  a rep from the company implied that the show was just a little too popular to do that.  not like i expected anything different from the channel that brought us cita.    i applaud the women of spelman for deciding to protest nelly's visit despite the fact that this particular visit was inspired by good.  further, they gave me an opportunity to reflect:  1) what the hell makes you agree to have a credit card swiped down your ass?  2) what the hell makes you think to swipe a credit card down somebody else's ass?  3)  sure, they didn't  make  her do it, but that argument is so old.  that doesn't abdicate nelly, or the producers, or the directors, or BET, or anyone else even remotely involved for objectifying women.  when she was younger, my little sister probably would've let me push her down the laundry chute, and i wouldn't even have had to pay her.  that doesn't mean i should've done it.  4) ladies in these videos:  having a credit card swiped down your ass is not going to lead you into acting.  sure, they call you video models on mtv, but in reality, most of us call you, ahem,  video hoes .   i'm not saying calling you this is okay, but don't give mofos reasons to denigrate you.    5) just because we didn't see your face (did we?) doesn't mean it's okay to do things one wouldn't normally do.  hell, i don't think my mama could pick my ass out of a line-up, but you best believe i'm not going to do something so embarrassing that my only available excuse is, 'it's not like they knew it was me.'  6) sure, if you didn't somebody else probably woulda.  but did you ever consider the idea that if all of you didn't, these rappers and video directors would have to try something different, like say um, being creative? don't help perpetrators perpetrate.  7) how much did you get paid?  objectifying yourself for less than 10K is stupid.  have you no shame?   8) number 7 was a joke.  that is all.

       I USED TO LOVE H.E.R.: MORE REFLECTIONS ON HIP HOP...THANX, LATIFAH.       whatup, lubna!!! (had to get that out the way.)  after bitching about videos hoes and whatnot, i got all nostalgic and crap thinking about the glory days of hip hop.  no, no, i'm not talking about the hey day of bad boy and puff diddy pop shiny suit man, p. diddy.  nor am i speaking of the sugar hill gang and all the rest (i wasn't born yet).   i'm talking about the days of yo' mtv raps, of bet's golden age--video soul, video vibrations, rap city w/ chris thomas, video lp with sherry carter and madeline woods.  i'm talking about the age of ladies first.  i'm 24 (2/22--buy me presents), which means the late 80s and early 90s were my formative years, the moment when i first became strung out on tv.  for a long time, fort wayne didn't have a black radio station--at least, i don't remember one--so i relied on cable tv and the shows dictated by my summertime teenage babysitters, to receive my lessons in black popular culture.   i fell in love with hip hop when folks merely thought it was just a (j.j.) fad (and we're here to rock), and fortunately for me, when i was coming of age, women were rocking the stage.  (did that rhyme?)  before the age of bling and (ahem) gangsta rap, hip hop was in a 'black nationalist' moment.  public enemy, b(oogie) d(own) p(roductions), x-clan, etc. all taught me to blame the white man for the plight of black people other than myself, who didn't happen to have upwardly mobile parents who could live on streets like stowaway cove or cedar branch trail.   more importantly, unlike my younger sister, whose feminine hip hop influences were lil kim, foxy brown, and trina, i saw women such as mc lyte, monie love, miss melodie, and queen latifah on television donning crowns instead of thongs.  instead of, "i used to be scared of the dick/now i throw lips to the shit/handle it like a real bitch/heather hunter, janet jack-me...," i heard, "the ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked/those that don't know how to be pros get evicted/a woman can bear you, break you, take you/now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to/a sister dope enough to make you holler and scream..."     it took a credit card getting swiped down a woman's ass to get me to realize how fortunate i am to have had such alternative images in hip hop, the music that purportedly defines my generation.  granted, the politics of 'black nationalism' are controversial and debatable, and i'm not claiming that these women--or all hip hop groups at this time--espoused such a political stance.   nor am i downplaying or ignoring the misogyny(homophobia, etc.) that has seemingly always colored hip hop.  but i'm so appreciative for having been born during a moment when the queen ruled hip hop.  because of that, no matter how many bringing down the house sequels she makes, i'll always have much love for dana owens.  i'm so thankful for that moment in hip hop because it allowed a space for a group of women in hip hop to flourish in front of my eyes.   not only were women present, but they had voices, and they weren't merely relegated to the ass-shaking background.    i have a nagging suspicion that none of this is true, and that i'm just getting older.  pretty soon i'll sound even more like my mother, arguing how the french fries at mcdonald's and the popcorn at the movies used to taste so much better when i was coming up.  perhaps i've merely constructed this golden age to link it with my embarrassment  and disappointment with the current state of music i love.  i have only ever been defiant for hip hop.  (when i was in third grade, my dad confiscated a public enemy tape--yes, a cassette tape--i got from a school friend.  i had to sneak to watch rap videos because my parents banned us (my bro and sis) from rap videos around the same time they told us we couldn't watch the simpsons, which i haven't seen since.  i blame lil sis for the latter punishment, she should've never told dad to eat her shorts.)  that said, i suppose i should thank the age of bling.  that's how i re-discovered how dope songs in the key of life was, the pain in what's going on, and the hypnotic nature of exodus.  besides, if it weren't for the tragic state of hip hop, would i have anything to bitch about?  nevertheless, i shall...proceed...and continue...to rock the mic.  that is all.  later.

       POETS, POETRY HEADS, HELP A SISTA OUT   aight.  so my senior year in college i took a creative writing course, and during the poetry section, my teach gave us this collection of poems.  there was one poem in particular that (ahem) "spoke to me".  the problem is, i don't remember the title, and i lost my copy of the poem.  i thought it was by louise gluck (who is so dope), but i think i'm mistaken.    here's a synopsis (as i recall):  it's about this chick gets kissed by this drunk guy at a bar, and she says something like, you're drunk old man, go home. then she goes on to say that when she feels her lover's kiss (as compared to other kisses), she gets all weak, and then there's the phrase saying that she, or some part of her, "liquefies to milk"--the part i found really powerful.  the poem is very short, maybe two paragraphs.  very crude, indeed.  but i try.  if you help me find this poem, i'll give you a dollar.

       THINGS I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS WEEKEND   --why can i no longer google my blog?  --is there seriously, for real, a new, african american centered sitcom on abc called the big house?  did the title of that show really get through the network hierarchy?  i mean, are you telling me that nobody thought twice about the series' title?  i'm not all that smart, but i might have asked something like, "don't you think we should change the title, since the big house is a colloquial term for jail? i mean, that this show stars a young black male, and since not a whole lotta people are going to the big house faster than young black males, don't you think we should maybe change the name?"  or, i might have said something like, "wasn't the term big house used by the enslaved to refer to (ahem) massa's house during those glorious antebellum days that are now gone with the wind?"  the racial and juridical implications of such a title, it seems to me, are hardly little known.  but, i guess the title may actually have something to do with the show.  i mean, it's not like i've actually seen the show.  gosh, i'm sounding more and more like the naacp everyday.  i bet if the show lasts an entire season, it'll get nominated, and will probably win, an image award.  --similarities between paula abdul and j.lo: 1) both are all right dancers and can't sing, yet seemed to make a helluva lotta money doing both. 2) at some point, their ethnic/racial origins became non-existent.  i mean, when's the last time j.lo was latina?  puerto rican?  nobody even mentions her last name, the prime indicator of her genealogy...am i the only one who recalls that one spread in jet mag. about all the "racially ambiguous" female performers of the early nineties (abdul, carey, et. al.)?  well, i coulda just make that up. 3) both dated black men (arsenio hall, p. diddy) with serious mouth-area issues during the prime of her career.  seriously, money did not make either one of those men handsome.  more dateable?   yes.  but handsome?  no.  besides, does p. diddy have that much difficulty keeping his bottom lip in the same vicinity as the top one?  he makes too much money, and is too damn old to look like  2 year old....oh yeah, and arsenio hall's gummy ass smile scares the shit outta me.  *pumps fists and barks circa 1991* 4) both, at some point, irked the hell outta me, causing me to waste brain cells theorizing why they were rich and famous.  still, i think paula abdul is way nicer.  and i almost regret (no, not really) that i've associated her with j. to the lo.  i mean, ms. abdul played a very significant role during my formative years as both an entertainer (i loved that video with that cartoon cat, plus she was a laker girl back when majic "i don't really have h.i.v." johnson starred for the lake show), and as the dance mentor for the pre-boob flashing janet miss jackson if you're nasty (who, i might also add, i busted my lip and broke my glasses for by trying to imitate that chair stunt she does in the pleasure principle video in my parents basement).  and when it was all said and done, when it came to the music, paula took the songs and made them her own.  --who the fuck greenlighted the movie soul plane?  the same people that told jamie foxx that his hair (in the previews of the movie, breaking all the rules, or some lame ass name like that for example) was ok maybe?  i mean, if we're going to hold onto a racialized, essentialized notion of the (black) soul, does it have to be so pejorative, and um, well, ghetto?  --if someone could very craftily and peacefully remove the following people from such a public position, the world, and my life, would be so much better:  kobe bryant, usher, karl malone...  --speaking of usher:  this muthafucka...  --where are all the cool, sane, unequivocally attractive honeys who wanna date me?  --why am i the only person up on van hunt?  --where the hell is RES?  --i'd like to somehow incorporate the following lyric into my daily vernacular, simply because i like to say it: who the hell is this emailing me at 11:26? tellin' me that she's 36-26/plus double-d/you know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee...  --ashton kutcher gets about a million props for punking tichina arnold, vivica fox, and tisha campbell at the same time.  --dave chappelle.  nuff said.

       HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EL HAJ MALIK EL SHABAZZ       on my 13th birthday--or 12th, perhaps--i dragged my dad to kay jewelers in southtown mall so that he could by me a 14K gold X charm and rope chain as a present.  i had been eyeing it for months, hoping pops would get it for me soon.  (interestingly, the jeweler had the charm in one of its outside display windows.  pretty smart, i think.  they were really trying to cash in on the early nineties malcom x/black nationalist kitsch movement.)  i suppose i wanted such amateur bling to represent my new black nationalist stance.  several months prior, my dad had also purchased "the autobiography of malcolm x" from waldenbooks (the one in glenbrook mall).  (my mom got really pissed b/c he got it for me in hardback, and not paper.  she thought he could've spent the difference on something i immediately needed, like, um, a pair of pants.)    i read the auto the same summer i'd read roots, queen, and exodus--i must have been really into big, long (at many moments boring) books, excuse me, texts about oppressed people.  i had also become further enamorated with hip hop, and started writing wack-ass raps in a notebook, trying to be an emcee.  the point is, malcolm's story had a profound affect on me.  despite the fact that i wasn't a young urban black male, and i really wasn't poor--the 'rents were just beginning to move on up--the auto made such a heavy impact on me, that i had to preach the word of malcolm whereever i went.  i won my class, school (memorial park), and city (fort wayne, beeyotch) speech contests with a speech on malcolm.  i memorized and randomly inserted quotes into conversations i had with my fellow pre-teens.  i drove my teachers--especially mr. reed, my homeroom teacher--crazy.  i recall one time, we were discussing the rodney king ordeal in homeroom, and mr. reed had the balls to say that we hadn't been shown the whole tape.  immediately, i began channeling the "i charge the white man..." quote of malcolm's, letting mr. reed know that we (the black kids in the class) weren't gonna tolerate such bullshit from the white devil.  (interestingly, that was mr. reed's first and last year of teaching.  i think he went back to colorado after that.)  gosh, i was such a militant geek.  perhaps it was what people said about him that made/make him so appealing.  partly, i think i was attracted to someone we didn't learn about in school.  by that time, i had been so inculcated with the non-violence of king, that anything even remotely characterized as the antithesis of such a pacifist, non-christian approach i flocked to.  malcolm made me feel anti-establishment.  and i think, for the first time, i felt i was beginning to have a serious opinion about race, and what it meant to be black in america.  i would go on to read the auto another six times by the time i was 16.  i haven't picked it up since.  but i've often thought about  how different my life would've been had i not read the auto when i did.  although it has waned at times, i have never lost the passion that inspires me to study and talk about race. yet that more than likely is the most infinitesmal impact malcolm has made on any life.  i don't know many who loved his people more than he.  so that's why every february 21 (the day he was assassinated), and may 19, i  gotta give big ups to my main man, malcolm.    shit.  did i just get sappy?  happy 79th, brother malcolm.         on a lighter and more narcisstic note, malcom x's birthday is one of only three non-government sanctioned famous birthdays i remember, michael jordan's (feb. 17) and toni morrison's (feb. 18) being the two others.  not even bob "rastaman" marley (feb. 6th, i think) made the list.  hmmm...why are all the dope people aquarians?    other famous may 19 birthdays:  kevin "the kid" garnett, nicole brown simpson, and grace jones.

       FOR POSTERITY'S SAKE:  REFLECTIONS ON 17 MAY   this past weekend, i happened to catch one of those tavis smiley think tanks on cspan.  you know, the ones with all the supposed black public intellectuals who sit on a stage and talk about the state of black people?  the topic of this one was, of course, the verdict of brown v. board, and its impact 50 years later.  after listening to laini guinier and elaine jones (i know she headed up the legal defense fund, but the chick got on my goddamn nerves) have verbal sparring matches, tavis asked one final question to this first panel:  what will we do in this day and time that will cause such a discussion 50 years later?  perhaps yesterday's events in the state of massachusetts are a start.  50 years to the day after the supreme court made their unanimous decision concerning segregated schools and the notion of separate but equal, massachusetts became the first state to issue same sex couples marriage licenses.  now, i'm not attempting to draw correlations between the civil rights movement, and the quest for gay rights (that's a different blog), but i do think it interesting that the two events would share the same date.  i was listening to npr on the way home yesterday, and people were reciting letters that had been sent to president ike after the brown decision.  so many of them claimed that such a ruling would basically ruin american democracy as we knew it.  interestingly, similar sentiments were echoed concerning gay marriage.  those representing the conservative sect complained that allowing same sex couples to marry would cause irreparable harm to the sanctity of marriage, while simultaneously destroying the institution itself, and perhaps, society as we know it.  not that the latter is such a bad thing.  none seemed concerned, however, with the 50% divorce rate--the percentage of which, i'd venture to guess, is directly derived from heterosexual divorces.  well, none of the panelists mentioned this at all.  i wasn't really surprised. i mean, it's not like i expected a panel mostly of black people talking about black people to mention gay people--it's not like there are gay black people, right?  but i do sincerely hope that 50 years later, the events of yesterday can be considered in some of the same ways we consider brown:  as an opportunity to correct wrongs, as the right and obvious thing to do.  i hope our children (not mine, really.  i have no plans to actually bear children), are surprised such a controversry brewed over granting people rights they always should have had.    the demise of democracy, and the institution of marriage will not be brought about by same sex couples, i'm sure.  the world didn't end fifty years ago; a whole bunch of gay people got married yesterday and the joint is still spinning.  if democracy is ever going to be threatened, i don't think we should look to gay men and lesbians.  i'd bet such a threat will more than likely come from a straight white guy.  and he'll probably live on 1600 pennsylvania avenue in dc, or somewhere close to there.  anyway, congrats to all the newly married couples--both gay and straight.  i think it's kinda crazy to pledge yourself to somebody for the rest of your life, but i congratulate you nonetheless.  btw, civil unions are bullshit.  next time:  why i'll never get married, to a man or a woman.

       THE 'BURBS   i've been living in chicago for almost two years, now, and i'm afraid that i've become a bit homesick.  it's not that i miss the monotony of the 'burbs.  i don't really miss the quiet nights.  i do, however, sincerely miss the conviences of living so far out.  for example, i miss...  -- meijer :  you have not lived until you've been to meijer.  if you ever meet someone, and they say they live by a meijer, you know they live on the outskirts of the city.  that's how big meijer is.  it's kinda like living by the airpot.  i used to be able to walk to meijer.  our meijer was so far out, it had a stable for horses, b/c amish people would shop there...you haven't been shopping until you've been to meijer.  you can christmas shop at meijer.  at meijer, you can have your oil changed, buy a tv, a gallon of milk, get some shoes resoled, and pick up chinese for dinner.  meijer has about 50 check-out lines.  i saw the first self check-out lines here about 8000 years ago.  i can't believe the city is just now getting them.  meijer inspired the creation of SUPER-wal-mart.  that's how big that joint is.  boy i miss it.  -- sam's club :  i will never eat the following cereals b/c of sam's club:  crispix, smacks, cheerios, and frosted flakes.  this is where you go to get the 80 roll of toilet paper.  it's economy-size heaven.  you need a membership to get in, and you should also have a minivan and about 3 hours on your hands, because that's what you're going to need to shop sufficiently.  once my parents took me, and my lil bro and sis, and left us in the car while they shopped.  several days later, they returned.  in normal circumstances, this would be abuse, but you gotta realize that you can't have kids to go to sam's club.  so you either spend money on a baby sitter, or leave the rugrats in the car.  kids will hinder your shopping experience.  and besides, the little ones could get crushed by the paper towel.   -- steak and shake :  you can usually find a steak and shake by a meijer.  it's fast food, but not really.  they're open 24 hours a day, and i love their burgers and fries.  they even have real milkshakes--made with ice cream and milk!  you have to try steak and shake if you're ever in the 'burbs, ask my friend candace, who had never been to steak and shake until i took her to one in indiana.  don't be in a hurry if you go to the drive-thru, though.  they don't start making your STEAKburger until you order.  believe me, after your first one, you'll crave 'em.   -- free fucking parking lots :  never in my life had i actually had to pay to park to see a damn movie.  part of the allure of the cineplex is its monstrosity, showing about 800 movies on 750 screens, selling buckets of popcorn so deep you need scuba gear to eat it, sodas so large you need a straw about a mile long, and parking lots so big, you need a shuttle to get from your car to the door, you know, like at amusement parks:  remember you're at scooby 3B.  but not in the city.  in the city, you either search for about 2 hours looking for street parking, or park in a garage that costs you money to get out of!  i never dreamed that i'd be paying for both my movie tickets and my parking ticket.  and never, ever did i imagine that free parking on tuesdays would be a perk for going to the movies.  -- driveways :  sometimes, i won't go out the house b/c i don't want to lose my parking spot.  other times, when i leave i pray that i will find a spot within a block and a half from my apartment door when i come back.  with driveways, you don't have to worry about that.  with driveways, you can leave anytime you want, and come back with your exact space still there.  you don't have to worry about being boxed in by two strangers' cars.  you don't have to think about street cleaning, or parking meters.  no more theorizing about how the space either in front or behind the fire hydrant is the best.  alleys, i'm afraid, do not suffice.  it's all about the driveway (that you park on versus a parkway which you drive on.  weird).   -- real supermarkets :  here are the minimal requirements to be considered a SUPERmarket:  a cafe/coffee shop, an extensive magazine/book section, a deli that has value meals, a humongous bakery, butcher, and produce section, about 30 check-out lanes, a pharmacy and a video store.  the baggers actually know how to bag.  they're not some old farts looking for extra income who can't help you take your shit to your car.  no, these are high school football players, strapping young men who--before they lifted a cereal box-- the management made sit and watch a video on how to bag groceries correctly:  cans on bottom, bread on top!  they ask paper or plastic.  that, folks, is a real supermarket.      -- themed subdivisions :  subdivisions are small communities that share the same common space.  occassionally called additions, these are what give the 'burbs their sterility, for all the houses look the same.  often, there will be a sign at the entrances of these neighborhoods.  they have themes, like camelot, or avon lake.  the streets will be beautifully named, with monikers such as "lancelot way" and "falling leaf drive."  i used to live in a subdivision called, chandler's landing.  there was a dock at our entrance, and several manmade "lakes".  our streets had maritime themes.  we lived on stowaway cove; the main street was drakes bay run.  as a rule, the speed limit is always 15mph.  this, folks, is oprah's demographic.  soccer moms live here.  this is the manifestation of white flight.  and there's usually a meijer about 5 minutes away.   i could go on...super target, dairy queen, the mall, clean streets, mini-malls, the free standing kohls we used to get our school clothes from....

       I'M GOING TO SEE SHREK 2 TONITE!!      ...and i can't wait.  i heard it was great, from two good sources (lil sis, and mollie).  and since this is the only movie eddie murphy has been funny in since like 1990 (with the exception of bowfinger.  i'm super excited.     this excitement has caused me to mention a few of my favorite movies.   the lion king      we named our dog nala.  'nuff said.   coming to america     my most favoritest movie ever, "oh there they go. there they go. every time i start talkin 'bout boxing, a white man got to pull rocky marciano out their ass. that's their one, that's their one. rocky Marciano. rocky Marciano. let me tell you something once and for all. rocky marciano was good, but compared to joe louis, rocky marciano ain't shit."   madame x      moms turned me on to this movie.  lana turner's kinda dope.   to kill a mockingbird      the first book i ever really loved.  rachel's writing a paper on it that you should all read.  i was really sad when atticus (gregory peck) died.   moonwalker      he's the king of pop, there is none higher.  sucka emcees should call him sire...this flick has the full-length version of the greatest music video ever, smooth criminal.  i'ma poor some jesus juice (hee hee) out when he goes to jail.   zoolander      you don't think i know what a eugooglie is?  janelle and i drank coffee and watched this and  drumline  like 800 times over christmas break.   a bronx tale      my all-time fave mob movie.   jackie brown      ordell to jackie, "i bet you come in here on a saturday night, you need nigga repellant to keep 'em off yo' ass."  beaumont livingston is one of the greatest character names.  ever.   i got a little carried away with all the pictures, hunh?

       ZORA IS ROLLING IN HER GRAVE...IN OTHER WORDS, HALLE IS JANIE     okay, so the other nite i watched oprah, because i promised my mama i would.  we needed to verify that oprah was really doing what she was doing.  no, not marrying stedman, or proclaiming that she and gayle have in fact been more than best friends for quite a long time (wink wink).  what i wanted to make sure of was the fact that halle is indeed janie.  now if you've known me for more than a year, you know i've bitched about this before.  meaning, at some point during my bitching about  monster's  "make me feeeel goood"  ball , and halle's subsequent oscar win, i griped about the fact that oprah decided to fucking cast her as janie in her movie adaptation of  their eyes were watching god .  here're a few reasons why i'm mad.  --i know she gotta lotta money, but i'm sick of oprah buying the rights to all the good af am books and making them into movies.  i mean damn, first  the wedding  (also starring halle, which wasn't that bad), then fucking  belooooooveeeeedddd .  jesus, stick to your demographic: soccer moms.  some shit ain't s'posed to be a movie.  and if it's gonna be a movie, please don't cast muthafuckas who cain't act (or keep a man...now that's harsh).  in the words of q-tip: now why you wanna go and do that now, hunh?    --there are about a gazillion other fair-skinned black actresses in hollywood that could do the job, like, way better: lynn whitfield, that light-skinned chick from soul food, michael michele, that one chick from er who kinda sucks, lynette "tragic mullato" mckey, even vanessa williams. i'll even take jada "i married well" pinkett smith, or jasmine "whitley" guy.  hell, what about tisha "a whole lotta yella wasted" campbell.  i mean, with all her power and apparent concern about the lack of people of color in the media, oprah could even take this opportunity to audition and cast new talent...if all else fails, cast angela bassett and make her lighter by makeup or something.  --c'mon, man, we should know from her previous roles ( losing isaiah ,  jungle fever ) that halle berry can only kinda (emphasis on kinda) play a crackhead.  i suppose i should be happy that oprah didn't cast herself.  maybe she's figured out that her recycled miss sophia  act wouldn't work for this role.      i could go on for days...  by the way this   is not a picture of zora neale hurston.   in other news, my house negro act was a hit.  (details inside.)  speaking of...did another black person just win american idol?  wow.  i thought it was pretty amazing that a fat black dude from alabama became the "american" idol.  then again, her name is fantasia.  so i suppose her winning is equally amazing.

       I'M SO SORRY YOU'RE SUCH A BITCH:  REALITY TV SHOWS I LOVE THAT YOU SHOULD, TOO   but first, some logistics. --i can't write sad love blogs anymore b/c my mom gets all teary, and sends me long emails.  can you believe she called me enigmatic and hard to get along with?  jesus.  --i just want to say that alvin ailey is the shit.  especially for 10 bucks.  (you can get into shows at the auditorium theater for 10 dollars w/ a school id.  and they're some good seats, too.)  although this was my first time going, my faves are: treading (modern dance meets cirque de sole), juba, and revelations--particularly the "baptism" part.  --and finally, is mase really back?    anyway, back to tv.  as you probably well know, i used to be a tv addict, but now i've somehow been able to discipline myself to only about an hour on the weekdays.  that said, you also know that for a while there i was entirely consumed with the apprentice.  now that it's over, i've had to rely on reruns of chappelle's show to get me through.  of course, i'll always watch golden girls, and i've recently discovered just how funny roseanne is.    last week i saw some previews for this new reality tv show, superstar idol.  it airs on the wb--remember when they used to show all those lame ass black shows?--on monday nights.  here's the premise:  it's like american idol, only in reverse.  instead of dissing all the really bad people, the judges (tone loc, vitamin c, and some random white guy) dis all the good people, and convince the bad people that they're great.  after the preliminary rounds, they have the american idol sing-off, with an audience, dancers, the whole nine.  thing is, everyone--including the audience--is in on the joke, except, of course, the contestants.  the goal is to see if they can make it to the final rounds b/f any of the contestants find out.  how sadistic and deprave...my kinda show.  then again, how could these mofos not know how bad they are?  i'm merely watching this for the big "gotcha" at the end.    i don't watch survivor, the bachelor, or all that crap.  but, here are some reality tv shows that are really worth watching:   airline --this is the best reality tv show-- ever.  it follows the daily grind of southwest airline employees (at both midway and lax airports) and the customers they encounter.  they've dealt with everything from drunk passengers, to a man who had on no pants, to a black woman who was VERY pissed b/c the airline apparently fucked up her wedding dress.  check it out monday nights on a & e.  and if you don't have cable, you should get it just for this show.   the it factor -- before queer eye, i watched bravo for this show.  i don't think this one comes on anymore, but before airline, this was the best reality tv show ever.  during two different seasons, it followed the lives of struggling actors in new york first and then la.  these actors would leave auditions, and shit like, "joe didn't get the part," would flash on the screen.  you saw these people just broke; one girl started cleaning her friends' apartments just to make ends meet.  what i liked the most about this show, was that it wasn't fabricated, the way those other, "i wanna be a ____" shows usually are.  bravo was not helping anybody out.  and the fact that these folks were out there struggling everyday to accomplish their dream of becoming actors was really admirable.  the 7up guy b/f he became the 7up guy was on the show, and we got to see him when he finally got the part.  we also, unfortunately, got to see lisaraye's lame ass for an entire season.  despite that, the it factor was great.  i hope they bring it back soon.     the amazing race --now this is the only show i still want to go on.  i'm trying to convince my lil sis to come with me.  anyway, about 11 teams of 2 people (like sisters, friends, couples, etc.) race around the world to different countries doing a variety of tasks.  the object of the game is to not be the last group to make it to the pit stop and thus be eliminated from the game.  the sooner you figure out the clues to accomplish the tasks, the sooner you get to the pit stop, and therefore get to leave earlier on the next task.  in the finale, the last two teams return to america and run to the finish, the winner receiving like a million dollars.  what a great way to see the world--very quickly.   the restaurant --i really only like to watch the reruns on bravo.  (i like bravo a lot.)  but it basically follows this guy chef rocco, and his dream of opening an italian restaurant in nyc.  it's a very hectic and jarring show.  i like it a lot.  and i hear that the newest season is better than the last one.   gay weddings --with boy meets boy, queer eye, and this show, bravo was definitely attempting to bring the "gay" lifestyle to the mainstream.  anyway, this basically chronicled the lives of same sex couples organizing their weddings.  i think this might've been a one time deal, so if you didn't see it, you lucked out.  but you might catch a marathon every now and then.  i hope sonia and lupe are still going strong.   stage moms and dads --i heard the nutter family was on oprah.  anyway, the title itself is self-explanatory.  from a tone deaf fifteen year old whose mother thinks he's the next pop star, to a 5 year old girl who eats pixie sticks in order to have enough energy to make it through the pageant, this one is pretty interesting to say the least.  and yeah, duncan nutter is pretty nuts.  ***you should also check out the mockumentary  significant others .  now that shit's just funny.  what channel, you ask?  bravo, of course.  THIS JUST IN:  THERE'S GOING TO BE A QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GIRL!  YIPPEE!!!

       I NEVER DREAMED YOU'D LEAVE IN SUMMER...   for the most part, i've avoided talking about my personal life.  mostly, i've done it because i find my life to be pretty boring and ordinary; truly, there's nothing in my life really deserving of all my complaints.  but on a night like this, when the cable's out, and i'm feeling pretty lonely, i can't help but think of how not so long ago, my apartment didn't feel so empty...  i'm a super introvert; i have major issues making new friends.  spending most of my time at u. of c. doesn't really help this; it further exacerbates my social awkwardness.  for the most part, then, my phone doesn't ring, except for maybe my younger sister, who generally doesn't have shit to say.  and the very few friends i have aren't the frequently talking on the phone types.  granted, i'm sure i have the type of personality that causes me to involuntarily alienate myself.  despite my general comfort in being alone, i have as of late wished for a cohort of people in and around the chi that i could hang out with...but i digress.  all of that said, moving to chicago last year was pretty tough.  i only knew one person in the city--candace--and embarking on a life in academia sort of forces you into isolation if you don't fight it, therefore making it kinda hard to make friends outside of skool, unless you try with all your might.  although i'd met some pretty cool and supportive people, my first year of graduate skool put me in a state of mild depression and severe anxiety.  and though i do quite enjoy living alone, returning home to an empty apartment, and my closest friends several hours away only worsened my situation.  i started to feel that i wasn't going to be able to cut it, and i thought seriously about returning either to fort wayne, or my parents' home in cleveland with head down and tail in between my legs.  there was nothing, and perhaps more importantly, no one in chicago who gave me reason enough to stay.  that was until sometime in early may.   long story short: an awkward moment after a class turned into an email ,which turned into tea, which turned into a date, which turned into a relationship, and, a reason for me to remain in the second city for the summer months.  to put it in a rather dramatic term, this person (there'll be no names here) saved me in a way.  i had never really been in love before, but when fort wayne's own fell, she fell pretty damn hard.  needless to say, this relationship became intense very quickly.  and although still low-spirited, i finally had something to look forward to.  i had so much anxiety about finishing up work for skool, that i spent most of the summer depressed and in love, wasting my days playing yahoo pool, watching personal tlc and golden girls; eight hours a day waiting for my loved one to return from a day of actually doing something productive.  i would awake early in the morning, send 'em off to face the world, stare at my books, and promise to start my work at the top of each hour--until it got too late to start of course, at which time i would promise to begin early the next morning.  i felt like a dog waiting at the window for its owner to return home.  that's how depressed and in love i was.  by the time skool came around though, things just soured.  maybe it was the fact that mario's italian ice closed for the season, or perhaps that we were, zodiacally speaking, exact opposites.  a lot of it, i think, was the fact that by september, both of us had the u. of c.'s dick back in our asses.  whatever it was, we became horrible people, doing and saying terrible things to each other.  and now, a little more than a year later, i'm sitting here blogging instead of sleeping, and we barely speak to one another.    i'm thinking, perhaps i just don't know how to deal with losing the high of infatuation.  such a feeling was exciting, but it also made me really stupid.  after those three months, we both endured things we shouldn't have, the only excuse being, "well, i was in love..."  yet no matter how stupid i was/am/will be, right now, i want last summer back.  it's still two weeks before the skool year is over, and on this night, the nostalgia seems unbearable.    damn memories.  even i can't escape those without feeling something.  however can i return to being emotionally detached?  then maybe nights like this wouldn't be so hard.  (did i just post this shit on the internet?)  next time: back to tv.

       GREATDAYNDAMORNIN'      (today i played it safe/cards are in my favor...) i've had an absolutely atrocious and horrible week (yesterday was crazy/mysteries i know now, now i know...) but today, for the first times in months, it seems, i had a good day.  granted, until a couple of hours ago, i had been up for 2 days straight, the fatigue didn't bother me today.  i gave my presentation on  the street  this morning, and i think i was relatively successful.  my prof gave me great feedback, and for the first time, i felt a degree of satisfaction after giving a presentation.  that kinda sucks when you think about the fact that i've been doing this grad skool thing for two years, now.  but i'm not going to let that get to me (don't get confused about it/just try to do your thang/'cause in the end gotta know just how to play the game...).  in even better news, prof. goldsby also agreed to be on my orals committee.  although i don't have any of the lists started, solidifying a committee makes me feel some sense of accomplishment.  it goes like: major:  american lit. from 1940-present, "the rise of the hyphenated american"--d. nelson major/minor: from realism to modernism, "american literature from 1885-1936"--j. goldsby minor: race theory, "discourses on race from 1865-present"--k. warren --i hope they'll let me do two major lists (30-30-20), instead of (40-20-20-).  we'll see.  (i wonder if some of the profs in the department would be offended if they knew that i occassionally affectionately refer to them by "hip hop" nicknames i've given them.  for example...j/k, you'll have to ask me.  i've learned from  urlLink jett .)  anyway, i have an even greater appreciation, respect, and admiration for ann petry, even though i want to pronounce her last name pee-tree, you know, like that one dinosaur's name in  the land before time .  as a humorous aside, when i went to see that movie as a young child back in the late 80s or early 90s, i'll never forget when one of the dinosaurs jumped out of the water, hence scaring the main character (little foot?), a little kid in the theater said, 'he scared the shit outta him.'  that shit was funny...why is it so funny when kids curse?  but i digress.  but if you haven't already, you should read  the street .  and if you have, you should read it again.  in other news, i read in  red eye  today that don king's been going around the country drumming up voter support for bush.  apparently, the conservatives feel that king will establish a link for republicans to the african american constituency.  these mofos are even more out of touch than i thought.  oh, well.  i've learned a helluva lot this week.  i search for answers often/i paid the price for many/still long for happiness/not promised to the plenty i've gotta go on...  0 papers down, 5 to go.

       IT'S WEEK TEN, BABY!   which means, in a sense, absolutely nothing.  i still have like four papers to write before the september first deadline.  and, somehow i screwed myself about 2 and a half months ago by signing up for the last presentation of the quarter in my birth of the cool class.  i have to present on  the street  by ann petry. realizing that i never have to take a class again, however, is quite wonderful.

       HAVE IT YOUR WAY...SIKE      so anyway, after several quasi-productive hours at the library yesterday, i headed back up north for some grub, and to  sleep.  realizing that i didn't need to eat yet another cheeseburger, i decided to go to kfc, not that that's any better, but i promote diversity.  anyway, i pull up in the drive-thru, and order a #3 with mashed and baked beans for my sides.  can you believe this nigga had the nerve to be like, "it's about a fifteen minute wait for the chicken." i repeated, "fifteen minutes?"  he was like, "yeah."  being so tired, i just pulled off.  but i kept thinking, why did he say 'the chicken' like they served some other main course?  and why is it a fifteen minute wait?  i mean, it's not like they had to go in the back, kill the chicken, clean it, and cook it.  like...when's the last time kfc served chicken?         after that, i drove to the burger king by my house.  i ordered something that was obviously--not ostensibly, obviously--on the real, permanent menu.  can you believe dude was like, we don't have that anymore?  it wasn't even on the promo menu, so, like why don't they make it anymore?  then, when i asked for a hi-c, he 'corrected' me saying, "you mean, pink lemonade?"  i'm like, 'yeah,' even though the pink lemonade was hi-c pink lemonade.  to make matters worse, when i got home, nearly all the toppings were missing, even though i only asked them to hold the tomatoes.  i was s'posed to have onions, bacon, lettuce and cheese.  these mofos gave me a hamburger with sauteed onions on it.  i suppose it was my fault, though.  i mean, these are the same people who put no cheese on my double cheeseburger.  contrary to popular belief, special orders do upset them.  change your jingle, man.  this shit woulda never happened at steak 'n' shake.  0 papers down, 5 to go.

       GATHER 'ROUND PARTY GOERS AS IF YOU'RE STILL LIVIN'...      so last nite, candace, rachel, aaron, and i all went to see slick rick, biz markie, and doug e. fresh.  they were playing at the vic for like six bux!  no...you don't seem to understand.  i saw slick rick in concert!  why don't you get it?  i saw slick rick goddamnit!!!!  but how we got in is an even better story...or at least just as good...  so, although we originally planned for 8:30, it was decided that we shouldn't go to the vic until like 9:30.  since candace and i are closer (she lives around the corner from me), we got there at about 9:15.  by this point, the line was already around the corner.  candace and i stupidly stand in this line, get frisked, id checked, only to find out that all the people in this line already had tickets.  so we go to the box office, but there's this sign that says, "tonite's show sold out." so i go up to the lady to see if we can buy will call tickets that don't get claimed, but she's like no b/c they've already paid for them--which doesn't really explain to me why i can't buy those tickets, but whatever.  the point is, they ain't have no tickets.  so i call rachel to tell her to just go home.  but candace is persistent.  all the people around us are scalping tickets, so by the time we decide to act similarly it appears as though we're screwed.  we walk back down towards the line, quietly looking for folks willing to sell.  in the meantime, we look around and talk about people, considering that maybe it's because we don't look "hip hop" enough that we can't get in.  anyway, i'm pretty much ready to give up, but candace convinces me to walk back to the box office.  we see these two girls who had bought four tickets from someone earlier.  candace noticed that they seemed to be willing to sell.  so i ask them if they have four tickets i can buy.  the girl's like yeah, and says she'll sell them to me for 24 bux, meaning she makes no profit.  this RANDOM ASS black dude comes  up and says, i'll pay you 45.  hesistation.  i look down.  i look up and say, 'i'll give you 30.' and she's like okay.  i gave candace my 20 (i'da bailed her out, if she got arrested), and called rachel to tell her to get her ass back there.    long story short, i bought my first pair of scalped tickets.  dad (he was a police officer for 25 years) would be so proud.  anyway, we got 4 tickets for like much less than one ticket would have cost.  next up: jill scott aug. 2 @ hob.

       UM...    urlLink     urlLink Which Historical Lunatic Are You?    urlLink From the fecund loins of Rum and Monkey.     Which Historical Lunatic Are You?  You are Joshua Abraham Norton, first and only Emperor of the United States of America!  Born in England sometime in the second decade of the nineteenth century, you carved a notable business career, in South Africa and later San Francisco, until an entry into the rice market wiped out your fortune in 1854. After this, you became quite different. The first sign of this came on September 17, 1859, when you expressed your dissatisfaction with the political situation in America by declaring yourself Norton I, Emperor of the USA. You remained as such, unchallenged, for twenty-one years.  Within a month you had decreed the dissolution of Congress. When this was largely ignored, you summoned all interested parties to discuss the matter in a music hall, and then summoned the army to quell the rebellious leaders in Washington. This did not work. Magnanimously, you decreed (eventually) that Congress could remain for the time being. However, you disbanded both major political parties in 1869, as well as instituting a fine of $25 for using the abominable nickname "Frisco" for your home city.  Your days consisted of parading around your domain - the San Francisco streets - in a uniform of royal blue with gold epaulettes. This was set off by a beaver hat and umbrella. You dispensed philosophy and inspected the state of sidewalks and the police with equal aplomb. You were a great ally of the maligned Chinese of the city, and once dispersed a riot by standing between the Chinese and their would-be assailants and reciting the Lord's Prayer quietly, head bowed.  Once arrested, you were swiftly pardoned by the Police Chief with all apologies, after which all policemen were ordered to salute you on the street. Your renown grew. Proprietors of respectable establishments fixed brass plaques to their walls proclaiming your patronage; musical and theatrical performances invariably reserved seats for you and your two dogs. (As an aside, you were a good friend of Mark Twain, who wrote an epitaph for one of your faithful hounds, Bummer.) The Census of 1870 listed your occupation as "Emperor".  The Board of Supervisors of San Francisco, upon noticing the slightly delapidated state of your attire, replaced it at their own expense. You responded graciously by granting a patent of nobility to each member. Your death, collapsing on the street on January 8, 1880, made front page news under the headline "Le Roi est Mort". Aside from what you had on your person, your possessions amounted to a single sovereign, a collection of walking sticks, an old sabre, your correspondence with Queen Victoria and 1,098,235 shares of stock in a worthless gold mine. Your funeral cortege was of 30,000 people and over two miles long.  The burial was marked by a total eclipse of the sun.

       O, I WISH I WAS IN DIXIE!  HOORAY! HOORAY! IN DIXIE LAND I'LL TAKE MY STAND TO LIVE AND DIE IN DIXIE AWAY, AWAY, AWAY DOWN SOUTH IN DIXIE!      everybody knows i'm an arizona tea crackhead.  i first got strung out on the green tea a couple of months ago.  but the other week, i saw this "southern style" sweet tea they had at my local 7-11, so i thought i'd check it out.  now i'm not from the south, but i think it's pretty damn good.  i mean, i had a lot of sweet tea at my family's reunion in montgomery, alabama a couple of years ago (i peed all night), so i think i'm a pretty good judge.  needless to say, i was quite sad when i saw that i may need to be offended by arizona's packaging.  last saturday, when i was passing time away with my family in bryant park in nyc, i noticed that this can of tea contained an image of a plantation, complete with a southern belle or two, and some trees (magnolias, maybe?) lining the path to the front door.  when i pointed this out to my mother, she jokingly asked me if this meant that i couldn't drink the tea anymore.  then, i told her no, but when i described the can over the phone to my pal, rachel, authenticator of all things southern, she said i had a right to be hostile.    so...i've decided to send arizona a little email, to tell them how silly i think they are for putting this image on their can.  for your reading pleasure, i've included it below.  hopefully they'll send me some coupons for some free tea.  (honestly, that may be the true reason why i'm doing this.)  I became familiar with your product from a friend who was/is a big fan of your Green Tea.  After trying it, I quickly became a fan of that same flavor.  About a week ago however, I came across your "Southern Style" Sweet Tea.  I was very impressed with it.  Yet, as I was drinking it, I noticed the image you have on your can, that of a plantation house, complete with Southern Belles, and trees lining the walkway to the front door.  As a semi-conscious consumer I have several problems with this:   1) Doesn't it stereotypically represent the South?  With the exception of some tourist attractions, I highly doubt that one can charcterize the region in such a way.  So why try to uphold such images?    2)  Perhaps you thought that such an image would spark nostalgia for a period in which this sweet tea you've bottled was most popular.  Maybe not.  But what's important here is that the image you've offered not only does not include, but blatantly ignores the institution that this lifestyle you've illustrated relies upon: slavery.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you're supporting slavery, or are racist or anything.  I'm simply attempting to point out how unwise your decision was.    3) You really shouldn't try to cash in on the cultural resonance of ostracizing the South.  Your image implicitly relies upon an idea of the South that constructs them as other.  Furthermore, not even 1/5 of white southerners could afford this lifestyle you've captured.  So why make this plantation image a metonym for southerness?   4) If you're trying to authenticate the "Southerness" of your tea by presenting a "Southern" image, well, that's just silly.  I mean, your tea isn't even from Arizona and that doesn't bother me, so I don't expect your Sweet Tea to be bottled in like, Georgia.    5) I know you had a board of your biggest and brightest to approve of this image.  And well, that's kind of scary for consumers like myself.  6) I sincerely hope that the male on the porch is not African American.  Maybe your tea isn't so good after all.   I'll be whistling Dixie until I receive a response.  Sincerely,  S. McDonald

       GUESS WHO'S BIZACK?  STILL SMELLIN' CRACK IN MY CLOTHES. DON'T MAKE ME HAVE TO RELAPSE ON THESE HOES...JUS' PLAYIN'   i'm back from the ny, and i feel great.  i didn't realize how much i needed to get the hell out of the chi, that there was way to much negative energy in this place.  so i feel a bit lifted after having spent some time in the middle of nowhere.  good things that happened while i was gone:  --since our last family reunion in 2002, nobody in the family died.  --the detroit pistons kicked the lakers' ass in the nba finals.  i believe the series is the first five game sweep in nba history.  --i won bingo on the cruise ship.  they gave me 110 bux.  in lesser news, my uncle and mom also, won name that tune, but my victory was sweeter--and much more profitable.  --i finally got those scraggily ends of my hair taken care of.  --i had like 7th row seats for  a raisin in the sun .  mr. combs pretty much sucked, but everyone else was super good.  phylicia rashad definitely deserved the tony, and it was her birthday, so we sang happy birthday to her after the show.    sanaa lathan ( love and basketball ) played beneatha, bill nunn (radio rahiem) played bobo, and audra mcdonald ("wit",  having our say , and the woman tied for most tony wins), played ruth.  the show was much funnier that the original (movie), and it was the first time i'd actually seen the play staged.  the only famous person i saw in the crowd was the latina chick from  ny undercover  who played a cop and michael de lorenzo's girlfriend.  --it looks like nala might move to chicago with me, as soon as i can find a pet friendly apartment.  in not so good news:  --i came back only to find out that the office i work for no longer exists.  the university has decided to "restructure" it, and hence fired just about everybody in the office.  unemployment, it seems, is inevitable.  --my first cousin died at the age of 26 last thursday.  he fell and hit his head, and died of a brain aneurism (sp?).  so i gotta go to return to fort wheezy this week.  --i'm still broke as hell.

       THE COMFORTS OF HOME...OR, I LOVE THE SUBURBS, PART II    i haven't been to fort wayne in maybe over a year.  which is a pretty long time considering that it's only about 2.5 hours away, and i have a car.  yet my cousin's funeral required that i go back to the dreaded fort wheezy for a couple of days.  mostly, i get into fort wayne, and immediately start cringing.  i look around, and can't believe this is where i was born and raised.    but this time, i felt kinda nostalgic, remembering all the shit i miss.    since most of the shit i miss is (comfort) food, i've decided to create a list of shit i can get in the fort, that i can't in chicago.   pizza king : granted, home run inn has become my favorite pizza of all time, i love me some pizza king.  they have the pepperoni in the little squares.  and, as my cousin very astutely pointed out last weekend, their slices aren't in triangles.  pizza king is still the shit, though.   zestos : i'ma let you in on a little secret.  you can get me to go to zestos before you can get me to go to dairy queen.  and everybody knows how i feel about dairy queen.  but zestos is the absolute truth.  the best soft serve on the planet, i tell you.  what pisses me off, though, is that i heard they openend a zestos right by my old house, and i'm not there to enjoy it.   lee's famous recipe chicken : now normally i wouldn't speak publically about chicken.  but i must supply you with the name of the place that makes me hate every other fast food chicken out there (i can't believe i'm writing this).  these mofos got real green beans. 'nuff said.   casa's :  i still haven't found an italian restaurant that can fuck with casa's.  the best salad in the world.  period.  true, they fell off a little, it's still the shit.  and in even better news, mr. d'angelo's nephew has a restaurant in the suburb my parents recently moved to.  that makes me very happy.  for a moment there, i started missing home.

       RANDOM   --why can i no longer find arizona sweet tea anywhere?  --why is it already july and i have yet to start any of my papers that are due by the first of september?  --how come nobody told me that pink was the official new ghetto color before i wore it in public?  i'm afraid the tone often symbolizing health, feminity, little girl babies, and bubble gum has officially joined the ranks of lime green, baby blue, and that one burberry print.     --when did bill cosby become controversial?     in the spirit of this last question, here are some cosby show facts:        --during the first season, he was dr. clifford huxtable, not      dr. heathcliff huxtable.  this is proven by the nameplate on the outside of their house.        --rudy was supposed to be a boy.        --speaking of, she and theo are the only huxtable kids whose middle name we knew (rudith lillian huxtable, and theodore aloicious huxtable)        --during the "tropical" intro to the show, there's the moment at the end of the theme song where the cast's hands cover bill's face.  well, somebody moves their hands prematurely, and it's theo.  i don't know if this is on purpose.        --joseph c. phillips (martin kendall) dated sandra (he was a premed at wilberforce) before he played denise's husband in later episodes.        --and while we're on the topic, blair underwood played robin givens' boyfriend (a wrestler with an academic scholarship to attend central state univ., another ohio hbcu), and a friend of denise's during the judity jamison episode--you know the one where denise wanted to sleep outside to get concert tickets, but they wouldn't let her.  anyway, --why is  caucasia  pretty good, but i can't finish it?  and, --who in the hell left the gate open?

        I'M TOO YOUNG TO SEE THIS!!!!: the blog block continues....         things i'd never seen (or only saw on tv), until i moved to chicago:    --three crackheads smoking on a stoop: parking my car on kenmore late one night, i see two white guys and a black woman right in front of where i want to park. one of the guys is sitting, holding something that, to my virgin eyes, appears to be a crackpipe. i said to myself, "i may be from fort wayne, but i know a crack pipe when i see one." the other two saw me, and tried to block him. being crackheads, they didn't do a very good job.     --prostitutes on my corner: i've seen several here in the past few weeks. once, this "john" was trying to get a hook up saying things like, "but me and your brother go way back." 'scuse me sir, if i may quote from quentin compson, "did you ever have a sister? did you?" i'm not sure if big bro would play that. earlier this week, i saw this other dude cussing this really old prostitute out for what appears to be refusing to serve him. he apparently thought that she thought his money wasn't good enough. at least that's what he kept screaming between "old bitch" and "dirty ass whore."    --gangsta homeless people: other than that one time in nyc when this old black dude with no drawers on came up to my cab asking for money, i find the homeless population in chicago to be the most gangsta. i mean, they walk up to your car, send their kids to ask you for money, and then catch an attitude when you're like no. i mean, this one time, my friend greg said this homeless lady followed him and kept asking for money, when he finally said no, she copped and attitude and said, "well that's all you had to say then," and walked away.    --a real life drug deal: dude was selling drugs on a bike.  in the broad daylight.  wow.    --people with super powers: my ex and i were walking to the car after coming from soul kitchen one night, and i swear to god this dude jump out of the wall with a dum-dum in his hand and said, "damn, girl you know you fine."     **should i be fearful that most of this happened in my neighborhood?      SOMEBODY PLEASE GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT!!!!

            W    OTS IS YOUS BANGING ON ABOUT?      caught the season premieres of  da ali g show , and  def poetry , hosted by the might mos. normally i won't be all hype about the latter, except mc lyte was on last nite. and e'rybody knows that she and latifah are like my all time fave emcees.            anyway, since i'm on spoken word poetry, lemme tell you why i don't particularly care for it:   i'm not a big poetry head. i mostly avoid it. i also don't think that poetry should be very long (which may partly be why, among other things, i despise t.s. eliot and others.       i don't like spoken word because it allows way too many folks to get props for writing some wack ass shit. in my humble ass opinion,   1) weak(er) writers get to hide behind the theatricality of the genre. get up there, frivolously gesticulate, work the stage, and mofos stop paying attention to the words that are coming out of your mouth. not working with me, buddy.   2) that typical intonation (you know, TALK like THIS: all UP and DOWN like a ROLLERcoastER, or LIKE playing a HIGH and LOW C on A PIanO! or, all low and peaceful UNTIL THEY STARY YELLING, AND SPITTING AND SWEATING!!!!) get's on my damn nerves. i know the shit's oral, but do you all have to sound one of three ways?       3) i don't give a fuck what it is. the words have to carry a great degree of power on the paper. i don't want to read something, be unimpressed, only to have someone say, "but you have to hear it, for it to be powerful." that's bull. i know reciting something adds a completely different dimension to the written word. but don't mask your wack ass writing through some overly body performance. i ain't buying it. (oh, and i'm not privileging the textual over the oral. i understand and appreciate the oral tradition. all i'm saying is, if your shit is wack, it's wack. no matter how you deliver it.)       4) i don't hate all spoken word artists. just a lot of them.       **some would argue that hip hop is a form of spoken word. i grant you that. but hip hop has a variety of aesthetics, so lack of lyrical prowess (take some southern hip hop--with the exception of 'kast, and goodie mob-- for example) is okay many times. their aesthetic does not require them to be as lyrically complicated as midwestern emcees tend to be (read: EMINEM, twista, and B.O.N.E. Thugs, por ejemplo).   by the way, i do a bomb ass spoken word imitation.   and, am i the only one who believes that mos prolly won't ever drop an album?

        THURSDAY ROUND-UP: SHIT ON MY MIND       SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS MY ASS   all right, so there's this building on my block that's section 8 housing. that is, i'm pretty sure it's some form of public housing that's not the projects. and there are some kids that live in that building that are always out and around the neighborhood, whether it's riding bikes in the middle of the street or hanging out at walgreens asking for money. anyway, the other week late one night, i was looking for parking, and i saw a couple of the more notorious ones opening up a car and looking inside of it, and i know it didn't belong to them. now, some folks would call 5-0, but the person in the passenger seat at the time reminded me that doing such a thing could cause more bad than good. sure, the person who failed to lock his/her doors may lose a cd or two, but getting these kids arrested could put them in foster care, land them in juvie, and/or simply put them in the system both earlier and farther than they were at that point. so i decided to refrain.    until this morning.    i'm driving down the drive, and i look into my passenger side-view mirror only to see that the mirror's all fucked up. that's curious because it was perfectly fine when i was driving up the drive yesterday afternoon--the last time i drove my car. now i know a car couldn't have done this because i parked so that that side was on the curb side. and there were no trees are poles that i could've hit because i parked directly in front of my building, where there's nothing but concrete between my car and my building. so...who could it be? i narrowed it to two suspects: 1) my bitch ass landlord and/or the maintenance dude, or 2) the aforementioned bebes (they don't die, they multiply). despite my acrimonious interaction with the former, i gotta go with the latter. of course, my whole "socially conscious" theory went out the window. i mean, dudes (allegedly) messed with my isht. and that pisses me off. probably out there at night, a time when you didn't have any business doing anything but sitting at home playing super nintendo.     and tell ya mama i'ma kick her ass when i see her.     "KEEP A FRESH PERM" SHARPTON KEEPS IT REAL   6 minutes...6 minutes...6 minutes reverend al you're on. i want al sharpton to be my granddaddy. or at least a great-uncle or something. i mean, who was gonna tell rev. al to shut-up after 6 minutes? were there democrats who really thought dude would only speak for 6 minutes? riiiiiight. "i suggest to you tonight that if george bush had selected the court in '54, clarence thomas would have never got to law school." does it get any realer than that?       ANTHONY ANDERSON   dear anthony,  you're really stupid. even though witnesses saw a screaming naked woman running from your trailer, i'm not interested in your innocence or guild. i don't care if you did it or not. but how, after several examples (cited below) do you put yourself in a situation to be arrested for alleged sexual misconduct? have the following mugshots somehow escaped your memory?     kobe bryant    before...                               after                        r. kelly    before...                                            after            mike tyson    before ...                                   after            not much difference, huh?  i hope he doesn't find my blog.        michael jackson    before...                                           after            *whew*!!!!  that took longer than i thought.     and now you  before...                               after         now that i've jogged your memory, i hope you can find johnnie cochran. he's got mad rhymes that'll keep you from a jail sentence.    sincerely,   summer a. mcdonald  founder and president of the n.i.g.g.a.s. (now i gotta grade yo' ass stupid) foundation    p.s. i never really liked any of your movies.  at least, i ain't really care if you were in them or not.

          THE *WHEW* FACTOR    i talk about race and ethnicity. a lot. i sit in the ivory tower, looking at the southside of chicago, and see black folks "across cottage grove" and theorize. i go home, look out my back window, and understand the difference between latino immigrants, and poor black folks, and theorize how the former's presence as a minority group affects african americans, particularly in instances concerning social services and affirmative action. i walk to my corner, and understand the integral difference between an african american and an african immigrant. so you better believe i pulled my scorecard out and chalked one up for the race last night after barack obama's speech.  let's not be confused. i'm not interested in:     whether obama's speech was "good" or not.    why a whole lotta folks can't say, "...that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white," any more eloquently than he did.    if he's genuine, or is the new face of the democratic party.    wondering if harold ford, jr. is somewhere hatin'.     whether or not he's cute, or looks like dude from  the five heartbeats .     absolutely not, folks. i'm interested in the quite distinct possibility that after obama gave his speech, those african americans who weren't sure prior, breathed a collective, big-ass sigh of relief when they saw that michelle obama was black. THAT'S TWO STEPS FORWARD FOR THE RACE!!!!  if race was the fiction all these intellectuals want to claim it is, and if identity politics are a thing of the past, this shit wouldn't have mattered. and i'll meet the person outside who dares to: 1) think that a segment of the african american population actually didn't exercise the *whew*factor, or 2) wants to explain this phenomenon in terms that are not directly concerned with race.  yes, dear readers, the *whew* factor is alive and well. it's what persons of color do when the guy on the six o'clock news who killed his whole family  wasn't  black. or when two black people  in a row  win  american idol . yet knowledge of the *whew* factor can cause a lot of pressure. you think the johnsons on family feud are simply nervous about the fast money round? hellssss no. why does the black guy go for the $500,00 on  millionaire  when he knows he should've stopped at $250,000? because he knows that if he doesn't win the cool mill, somebody's gonna start measuring his head, and tracing his ancestry to monkeys.  i must add here that the *whew* factor is not applicable to everything. there are some things we don't expect "our representatives" to survive, namely scary movies and reality television shows that involve voting and folks trying to get married. and outside of hockey and golf, we pretty much expect any sports news to be bad news about black athletes. hey, when the nba's more than 70% black, chances are it's a brother that got caught in the roadster with a bag of weed.  but: does one lose some sort of "credibility" if you're a (potential) african american (identified) leader with a non-african (american) spouse? or is it even possible, in this technological day and age, to separate the messenger from the message. i mean, there is the *groan* factor-- you know, when it was one of "us" that robbed the bank, or got that question wrong on  jeopardy , or if michelle obama had been from the north shore and not the south side. let's consider some who (at some point) fit under such a category:     frederick douglass (second wife)    julian bond    alice walker    franz fanon    richard wright    leroi jones (changed his name, divorced her, and moved to harlem)     kwame nkrumah    etc.   how can such a question of "credibility" be plausibly asked-- and i believe that it is--if race, as we often like to theorize it, does not exist? exactly. back to the drawing board you "race is a fiction" people.   and, who are these silly people running around talking about obama's gonna be the first black president? perhaps the same knuckleheads talking such trash about colin powell 4 years back? puhleeze. sure, it sounds really good when he's just a state senator. forgive my cynical and jaded ass, but that shit ain't happening. and if it does happen, well, he'll need more than the secret service and bullet-proof windows to survive those assassination attempts. bro might need security from the nation of islam. but i digress...  in even better news, al "keep a fresh perm" sharpton is speaking tonight!!!!  in the meantime, get yo' lazy ass off this computer and go register to vote. or, simply go  urlLink here , or  urlLink here , or  urlLink here , or...    urlLink    www.obama2004.org    urlLink    urlLink    www.johnkerry.com    and for fun:  urlLink www.jibjab.com  urlLink

IT'S OFFENSIVE.**       **on npr yesterday, carlos hernandez gomez described obama and keyes as "two articulate, harvard educated black men." now why is that always the first shit out of somebody's mouth?  off to a family reunion this weekend.  y'all pray for me, please.

      THURSDAY ROUND-UP: MORE FODDER FOR MY CANNON   baby phat gets put in the pen--literally (kinda corny headline, hunh?)  last week, kimora lee simmons--wife of def jam mogul, russell simmons--got pulled over in her mercedes benz, and was arrested for doing just about anything illegal you can do in a car (except have sex. she left that to a priest and a nun, but more on that later). but did mrs. def jam pull over immediately? helllsss no. she refused to listen to police, even when they got on their loud speaker, and didn't pull over until she came to the front of her house in saddle river, nj. if that isn't bad enough, hubby russ had the nerve to say a la rain man, "my wife is an excellent driver, and she's not guilty of any crime." except refusing to listen to the cops, and having a lil ganja in the ride. further, hubby got mad at the police for handcuffing his wife, which allegedly caused bruises on her wrists. have you been out of queens so long that you forgot that's what happens to folks getting arrested, sir? if that shit ain't work for michael 'i am peter pan' jackson, it sure as hell isn't gonna work for you or your wife. to add insult to injury, mr. simmons further intimated that his wife might have been racially profiled. hmmm.... now this   is a picture of kimora lee simmons, (nice mug shot). how in the hell, russ, was she racially profiled? i have never, everevereverevereverevereverever in my life, heard of asian people getting racially profiled, at least the type of racial profiling i'm thinking of. am i missing something here? has russ caught on to a social problem none of us has quite recognized? hmmm... your theory is: and not only do the police recognize she's (part) asian as she's driving by, but they see she's driving a benz, and everybody knows that an asian person must be up to some suspicious stuff if he/she isn't driving a honda or a toyota or a nissan or a lexus or a... all of this alleged "racial profiling" with the windows tinted, and i'm sure they were. word on the street is that mrs. baby phat's hercedes benz is loaded.  perhaps this is the real reason why russ is all anti-rockfeller drug laws. get the fuck outta here, homie. by the way, that vegan diet is not making you look any better.    the devil made me do it!!!!  earlier this week, a nun and a priest in malawi (that's in africa, folks) got arrested for indecent behavior in a public place. the two were caught having sex in a van in the parking lot of an airport. they got caught by people who noticed the interesting movement of the van itself. both pleaded guilty and seemed remorseful for their error in judgement.  out of all the places in the world to park in order to bang in the car, they chose the airport in the middle of the day. did the devil make you stupid, too?  and finally,  are you black and available?  can you run for senate?  wf iso bm or bf for run in november. must not be married, or if married must not be sexually active with spouse, and have an empty calendar for at least the next 3 months. must be willing to be to wear a black t-shirt displaying the letters "token" in white letters at all times. if interested, please contact judy baar topinka at 312/201-9000, or  urlLink chairman@ilgop.org .  after failing to support the candidate elected by their constituents in the primary, the republican party of illinois has officially reached rock bottom. they've been dissed by damn near everybody including mike ditka--who'd rather work with p. diddy on a remix to the "super bowl shuffle"-- yet they've mustered whatever pride they have left to not endorse the milkman who has major problems with immigrants, namely mexicans--hey, immigrants like milk in glass bottles, too!! so they've finally settled on asking another inevitable loser-- maryland citizen and 4-time political election loser, alan keyes.  yep, folks, republicans like to see black people fighting each other even at their own expense. i mean damn how much more blatantly stupid and ignorant can you be? you're gonna need some bush associates to count votes in order to win this one.  who knew that the party of lincoln in the very state of lincoln could fuck some shit up this badly? so, to help the gop out, i've compiled a list of black people with name recognition who seem to be available as of late. i've made sure that each is not currently and has never been a citizen of the state of illinois.     alicia keys --this brooklyn songstress is no relation to alan, and not really old enough to run for senate, but she has more grammys than he has election losses. might be some controversy in the pages of her diary, though.    gary coleman --why not?  dude's only lost 1 election as compared to keyes' 4.  plus he's a virgin, so he's guaranteed not to get jack ryaned.     whoopi goldberg --she's no longer the center square, her show on nbc got canceled, and although she's been dropped by weight watchers for comments made about president bush, with that ted danson episode a few years ago, i think she's a legitimate contender.  **i actually really like whoopi, but i'm going for laughs, here.     farah,     latavia, and     letoya -- also known as the former members of destiny's (step)child(ren), also known as beyonce 'n'em. collectively, they're old enough to run. given their positions in the group before being kicked out, and with the subsequent dropped lawsuits and such, i'm sure they're used to being used as puppets and losers.     pras --i know lauryn kinda went there, and wyclef is no longer significant to hip hop, but pras suffered the most from the fugees break-up. he never could rap, but i feel that his appearance on the  bulworth  soundtrack makes him a legitimate pick.    shaggy --this reggae explosion is currently skipping over him. that wack ass album seemed to have done him in, but he's due for a comeback soon. plus, his time in the u.s. military during the 1st gulf war should put him in good with the republicans.     ward connerly --there is no other black person in america that's going to fight harder against the rights of underrepresented persons than him. he's my pick.  any suggestions?

        NOW LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT...       let's see, this pregnant woman is reported missing by her stepfather--not her husband-- on christmas eve, and it takes 5-0 until april to arrest the dude. and he's now on trial for murder.  and then, two weeks ago, another pregnant woman comes up missing, and it takes the po-po's two weeks, to arrest hubby.  but a black dude, and a really famous one at that, such as    has a wife (and boyfriend) found stabbed, and it takes the law less than 24 hours to get homie handcuffed, and 4 days to arrest him.  see, that's why i ain't even all that mad oj ain't in jail.  (i know it's more complicated than that.  this is just an observation.)

       THURSDAY ROUND-UP: MORE SHIT FOR YOU NOT TO READ   VERIZON: WE NEVER  START  WORKING FOR YOU.    now, for the most part i don't have too many problems with verizon. verizon has employed my mother and damn near 10 other people in my family since forever. hence it's kept food on my table, clothes on my back, and got me throught college. and in general, i really have been satisfied with their wireless service. i've been with them a while, since i was a no credit-having prepay using cell phone customer. since i'm fiercely loyal, i signed up for new every two, b/c i knew that even with the technology to keep my same cell phone number and go to another company, i probably wouldn't. so the other week, i went to the verizon on north avenue and halsted to get my new phone. i got the slider because i thought  urlLink michelle's  was dope, plus all the cool kids are doing the flip phone now. anyway, i've been having problems with my slider. basically, the screen has a tendency to go blank when i switch modes. verizon has a 15 day exchange policy, so i knew i needed to go soon. since i've been in and out of town, and entertaining my sister, i didn't have time until the past monday. since i was on campus, i decided to go to the one on lake park.  my mistake.  dear verizon wireless on 5506 s. lake park blvd., chicago, il, 60637 773.947.2000,  i'm putting your store, and your employee, tim on blast. and i'm calling your supervisor this afternoon and cussing your ass out. then i'ma have my mama call pete, who's the boss of all you motherfuckers, and put y'all on blast.  y'all are a group of the laziest niggas i've ever seen. i've been to you three times, and each time y'all never cease to disappoint me. and i'm surprised because it's usually kinda hard to get a job at verizon.  but i guess this is partly my fault, because i keep going to your store.  let me explain why i'm mad.  1) when i came to get a car charger, i waited in line for about 45 minutes. and one of your employess had the nerve to be like "it's my time to get off." when she saw that the new employees you had working obviously needed her help and expertise. there were obviously too many people in the store with too many questions they couldn't answer. but she chose not to even go to the back to get her shit together. hellllsss no. she kept her ass at the front desk to rub that shit in. it took tim, back in the customer service aread 45 minutes to notice the problem and come help. that's unprofessional.  2) about a month ago, when i had a problem with my motorola, this same tim looked at me, like what you want me to do about it. he took my phone in his hands, looked up at me, and was like, "so what do you want me to do?" do you work here, motherfucker? then, he proceeded to give me the wrong address of the next closest verizon wireless. i never found the store.  don't worry tim, i fixed it myself.  3) monday, when i came to see you all about the problem with my slider. this same motherfucker had the nerve to look at me and say, "i'm not a tech, so i can't tell you what's wrong with your phone," but didn't tell me what else i could do about it. now this type of laziness is uncalled for since he just got on the clock. as a proactive customer, i walked him through basic customer service. i had him log into his computer, take my cell phone number, and see what exact date i purchased it. getting my drift, he told me that depending on when i bought the phone he could either give me a new one, or give me a refurbished on. i bought it on july 25; monday was august 9. he had his coworker, who, although still standing at the service desk stared at a man before she told him she was of the clock as of "one minute ago," check a calendar. they calculated that it had been  16  days from purchase. this motherfucker had the nerve to say that he would give me a refurbished phone, but would not give me a new one, even though my shit was 15 days old. i was too fucking mad to say anything other than, "because it's day 16, and not 15, you won't give me a phone?" this nigga was like no.  so i walked out.  tim, you are a fat, lazy ass motherfucker who's needs his ass kicked.  thank you, summer mcdonald founder/president of the n.i.g.g.a.s. (now i gotta grade your ass stupid) foundation.     BEEF: IT'S NOT WHAT'S FOR DINNER   working this summer as the office bitch for this summer program has been relatively cool. the most aggravating part has been ordering food for these bastards.  see, there're two vegans in the program, and basically, they can't eat anything.   when did meat eating become illegal?  i don't know about you, but i've never seen a healthy-looking vegan.  why of why is meat so out of style.  i blame oprah, don't you?   AND IN THIS CORNER...   vs.      okay, so i'm watching the news the other day, and i see alan "crazy ass" keyes talkign shit all irate and stuff. so they cut to obama, and dude, cooler than a polar bear colony says some shit like, 'keyes has lost 2 senate and 2 presidential races. correct me if i'm wrong but, muhammed ali wasn't saying everything he said after 4 losses."  damn!!!!       WHO THE HELL GREEN=LIGHTED THIS?     flex alexander: first   homeboys from outer space, and now this?    and he wasn't even pale enough to play michael jackson.  he looked like the director just told him not to put on lotion after showering.  i'm even madder at myself for watching this shit.    TODAY'S ROUND-UP WAS LONGER, BUT SOMEBODY STOLE MY BOOKBAG, SO I'M SHITTY.      IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY READS THIS SHIT ANYWAY.
