      Well ladies and gent's I hope your  ready       I mean  really   ready  for a story           "I, being the mindless idiot that I am, have dragged it on"         Well hear you go           I  t was a dark stary night  and  everyone everywhere was asleep except steve and matt who just refused  to give in to their tiresome tiredness... that is when, they went to  play online games.          That was when, the action started.  We wanted  to play the games, but we really didnt want to sign up for anything;  however you had to sign up to play the games.  Our final  conclusion was, that we would reluctantly sign up just to play the fun  games, which steve kicked matts ass in.          Durring the sign ups, they had the boxes for  screenname, email address, pasword... what else have you; they also had  the imfamous secret letter code that you have to type in for "security  purposes".  The letters read across in a patter GRJVJ.          And so Gorjivorj was born.  Matt laughed for  about 10 minuites on how the word sounded, while I, being the mindless  idiot that I am, have dragged it on to the next level because i couldnt  stop laughing before an hour.      great story  dont ya think?       I love myself im such a genius      I mean i created Gorjivorj   and LKO   and  The Suck Me Show       of course my partners in creativity-crime are also genius's      props be to you brit, kee, and matt      you are  true  geniuses

      most posts aren't imporntant enough to reach my blogger and my xanga... but this one pretty much says it all  so we lost, in the last inning we gave it to them on errors...  but baseball  isnt  about winning  baseball  isnt  about losing  baseball  isnt  even about having fun  this was the  greatest  game a man could ask for   despite  the loss   despite  the 2 strikeouts  and  despite  the error  this game brought my friends to me, and thats what  really  matters... more than stats, or catches, or smacking the shit out of a ball with a piece of aluminum   friendship  is the only thing that matters in life... if you have  friendship  you dont need anything else    grades, money, cars, gifts  ... when it comes down to it all these things are trumped by the one true act of god... the only thing that can save someone's life without even knowing it...    friendship    and to all my friends...  at that game or not ... i appriciate  every last one of you , and  truely  do love you  because life  isnt  about a game, good grades, or big bucks  life is about   friendship  ...    and boy do i lead a great life
