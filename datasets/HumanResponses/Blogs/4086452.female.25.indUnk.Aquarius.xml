      Hello everyone!   This would be my first post here (well, that's after a long while!) . I used to blog couple of years ago. My sis-in-law had a domain and she's so kind enough to host me. That's until end of 2002. Her domain expired and never renewed it. An abrupt&nbsp;decision! &nbsp;Blogging, journaling, web designing/layouting was her passion but for some reason it&nbsp;faded gradually. *sigh*.&nbsp;[the good news is ... recently she started blogging again at textamerica.com. &nbsp;im happy to know that :)&nbsp;]   anyhow, i managed to have my own blog. blurty.com&nbsp;was my comforting home... but just for a while. i can't explain it but&nbsp;the more i wanted to blog the less time i had...&nbsp; from daily blog to 'every other day' blog.... to 'twice a week' blog...&nbsp; once a &nbsp;week... once a&nbsp;month... until such time&nbsp;blurty is out of my system.&nbsp;that&nbsp;i even forgot my username and/or password.&nbsp; what a crap!   but well, &nbsp;i still see to it i visit my online frens' blog. read their thoughts, know &nbsp;their daily dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;love doing it. it's a part of me to have an update&nbsp;&nbsp;what they're doing,&nbsp; their whereabouts.&nbsp; i just love knowing people.   before i report to my work as a&nbsp;housewife/homemaker for&nbsp;today, hehehe, &nbsp;i would like to thanks jeanny,&nbsp;one of my closest online/wawie/nawie friends. &nbsp;her blog inspires to rebuilt my online life and connect with people again.   &nbsp;

      what we've been through for the past weekend! oppsss for the past  long  week-end i should say. :D  me: work on saturday, work on sunday and another work on monday (civic holiday here in canada)  james: no work on saturday, no work on sunday, and still no work on monday.  maswerteng nilalang!      oh my oh my! well, my consolation is, james picked me up last saturday, we proceed to Linen n Things and he gave me money to buy that blue bedding set i saw in a flyer.  It composed of a comforter, fitted sheet, flat sheet, 2 pillow cases, 2 pillow shams,  and a bed skirt) .  james knew that i'll be happy to have that!! yipeeee!!  ang saya ko talaga! kung pwede nga lang tumalon talon doon sa may tindahan eh! oa bah!    after that, we pushed through with our weekly routine--grocery! hahaha!! even my feet were aching,  sige pa rin! masaya na ako sa  purchase  ko eh ! ahihihihi!! at 5:20pm, we're home. after 10 minutes, we're at st. edward church hearing a tagalog mass. im so tired but i insisted to go. it's just 2 blocks away anyway. and it really feels like home to be with fellow pinoys.  Sunday, james picked me up from work again and we watched "13 going on 30" --a very hilarious with a slight drama movie.  a family friend gave us 2 admission movie tickets at Northgate Cinema City for just 50 cents each. would u believe that!?!  the movies are played a lil bit delayed, but it's fine with us. i cant wait till "the notebook" is on "now showing" board.  hope ate daph will spare us again some of her complimentary tickets! yahoooo!! hahaha!! but ohweils, maybe we can afford Northgate Cinema City's regular $2.75/movie the next time we go there! it's still cheap compared to Silver City's $7 something per movie per person. i remember, we paid $17.00 (including tax) for spider-man 2.  hayyyy, lahat dito mahal!! nasa  adjustment period  pa rin ako pag presyo ang pinag-uusapan. hahaha!   monday, we went to polo park   (it's a mall , not like a burnham park, hahaha!)  we went to "a buck or two" . i bought face towels, foam/bubble bath, bonnet, apron, birthday card (for my bestfriend back in the philippines), craft scissors (for my new friend ella; she's 8 years old and she's the daughter of james' bandmate kuya mando), and stick-on note pads. after that we went to Chapter's Book Store. i spent an hour browsing a scrapbook magazine. i wanna take it home... but i can't spend 12 bucks for just a magazine.  kuripot talaga ako!  instead i trade-in my 5 bucks for 3 books.   sale eh!  well, i really digged nice books-- 1. "Analyze Yourself: A teen's guide to understanding their friends, parents and themselves!" by Karyn Gordon.  This is for my 13 (going on 14) year old niece. hope she'll like it. 2. "Quarterlife Crisis: The Unique Challenges of Life in Your Twenties" by Alexandra Robbins and Abby Wilner. This is for my reading pleasure. hehehe!!! and 3 "Jimmy 'the bartender' Guide to Life: Advice on Women, Money, Sex, Work and Other Stuff that Screws up Men's Lives" by James 'Jimmy the Bartender" Kennedy.  i bought this to entertain me and james! maybe we can read a page or two before sleeping.  that's all for now, folkz! ^_,~  i can hear the dishes and the laundry are calling my name right now! *ngek*
