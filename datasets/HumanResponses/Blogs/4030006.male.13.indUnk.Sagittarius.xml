       I had been worrying about this since last year. Till now, finally i could be reliefed as they do not seem to ignore me anymore. Today was the first time i got the 'byebye' from them and i felt good. I did not expect them to say that to me, definately i cherished that. Before, i was searching for what are the reasons that made them mad with me or even ignoring me.  Today is my lucky day i guess. Did not have to do any pumping for not uniform checking, the groupwork was shared by the group again and i got back to the original ties. (Personal problems) Still i am worry for my studies which i did not manage well earlier. =/ >.   It had been a tiring day today, straight after PT (physical training) changed into full uniform and drilled for quite a long time over a period with only a few breaks and the squad today was attended by quite a lot of ppl.    Er .. I guess i am not the best person to become the timer as for such a huge squad like today i felt that i did not do a great job, my timing - clarity and confidence were definately not there.   Hope that i can bark up on the bad points and be a good timer which suits everyone's demand and hope that i could achieve my goals in my secondary lives. Heard from Chee wei and Boyuan about the studies in a Junior Colledge and found it quite difficult.   However, i hope that i can be able to make it to the JC and too make it through the JC and do well in University if i were to get i and have a good job ... That's what we people nowadays had to achieve for ... =P

       I was looking out at the ceiling fan whirling round and round ...   Just to stop the streaming tears to flow out of my red eyes.&nbsp;Provoking words are too much, everybody has limitation to what&nbsp;others say.   Argh ... why must i be so ill-fated. I was not supposed to be doing the project ALONE. It is supposed to be a group work and it ended up to be mine work.   There your all were enjoying your lolipop in the library, and it ended up that i am the one who should take the responsibilities to finish it up.   What kind of group work is this and you say you will be the one presenting huh - taking all the easy jobs ? I am really packed up with a lot of stuffs and here your all are trying to stuff more jobs for me.&nbsp;   I am doing all this for myself, it had always been like that. If the project does not concern me i would not even bother to ask if your all had finished it you know !!!   I was not sneaking away, throwing all my responsibilties to finish the work, i am just unable to be there and why must i finish the whole project. Ahh!!! Don't be so dependent on me please ..   People, some day you will feel what i feel. If i were to get mad i wont blame anyone it's just my fate right ? ... Anyway I don't even get to enjoy the lolipop and i gonna do all these things&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = ( ...

        As i was looking at the ripples formed by the raindrops which hit on the&nbsp;pool     of water ...      It was after the debrief of Suzhou Exchange, now that&nbsp;i finally realised that the school is quite realistic.   I am sad about that, maybe i am supposed to count myself unlucky that i didnt get to the higher mother tongue class i guess!   It seemed that the HMT is more superior compared to the express chinese. I cannot deny that they learn more chimology words in&nbsp; Chinese field compared to us but there is also one thing in doubt.   Is there really a great difference between the MT and HMT? For me, i dont think so.   There are also talents in the MT that can be taken to compare with the HMT and their standards can be definately the&nbsp;same or maybe even better.   However, one thing that pulls the MT student down was that they were not able to be as privilage as the HMT students to get to learn so much new words...   That sure made the students lose out . Anyway, what's my point of view is that we have equal ability as them and somehow we can be better than them in any fields.  Furthermore, learning extras things is to open another door for us not to not know our own limits ...

          End-Of-Year exams may seem a far stretch away but take a clearer view, it is jus a stone throw away.   So little time yet so much to learn, now i feared that i would not be able to get into my dream class.   My science had flung from a distinction to a B3, it is such a disappointment.   It gave me a great impact which made&nbsp;me sink all the way to the bottom of the sea.   My secondary school lives was not as easy as i thought, on the way to growing up, i had experience quite a lot of strong blows which I just managed to survived.   Secondary school days are like sailing, you would not know when a wave will come and capsize your raft and if you are able to overturn it back?   Friendship sure gave me extra blows too, luckily there are still a lot of best friends who gave me moral support.   When i am down they are just like the tissue that clear off my tears. I had to thank them&nbsp;cause I would not know where I would end up without them.   In hades ? Or on Earth. Now that i wished that i would be able to get in my dream class and not letting teacher(s) who had hopes on me down.   Definately, my friends who are at the back of me, supporting me.   When the going gets tough, get the tough going ... =P ... After all, I hope that i can do well in all my subjects and still be able to achieve my goals(some of you should know what izzit bah)... Same old phrase - Everyday is like a DRAMA&nbsp; ( if u are able to interpret it u will understand why izzit a DRAMA)

        The whole concert started off with the prize presentation.  I was marching up the stage with the overwhelming anxiety.   When I marched up, I was so nervous that i marched as though I am driving a lorry. Another reason was that I was afraid that I would hit the feather and let it fall.   However, despite all these precautions and measures, the feather still landed infront of the principal. I was not awared of it till I had gone down the stage. There and then, I was filled with embarrassement. Luckily in the end i got it back.      Our performance was welcomed by the sceams and yells of the whole school. I was glad from the response by the school yet I, or rather we, still had to maintain our posture and arrogant look.   That was the most difficult part in the whole fancy drill. On our previous trainings, we were critisized by others, we feel bad too.   Our turn out today was definitely very good to us but there are always rooms for improvement. Our every moves were accompained by screams and yells which also made me quite touched. Hopefully, people will understand the hardwork we put in and do not be so narrow-minded about this performance.   Over all the performance is a fruitful experience for all who are involved. We learnt a lot of things throughout the trainings too.
