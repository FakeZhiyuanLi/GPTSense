      Went to see the Bourne Supremacy this week. If you're looking for a great movie, I'd recommend this one. Its one of the few times when the sequel is at least as good or better than the first. Great car chase.

      Want to know where  not  to eat when in Omaha, Nebraska? Answer: Trini's Mexican restaurant in the Old Market district. Let me tell you why.  Its our 21st wedding anniversary. We have this gift certificate for $25 at Trini's (otherwise we probably wouldn't have gone there). Things start off ok, we have to wait 15 minutes but, hey, its Saturday night and they look like they're doing a pretty good business. It seemed a little odd though, there were a couple of open tables... Anyway, we get in, order a couple of margaritas and some nachos. The nacho order takes a while, but still within a reasonable period.  Then, nothing. We wait, wait, wait. We see other people who came in after us getting their food. At one point about 40 minutes after we're seated the waitress makes an appearance and wants to know if we need anything?! My wife looks at her and says "how about our food?" The waitress says it'll be right out. After about 50 minutes, the guy who either manages or owns the place is out busing tables so I ask him if he knows how long we've been sitting here. He asks us to decribe our waitress!!! So he says he'll check. I suggest that the margaritas should be on the house since we've been waiting for almost an hour and he says, in a very rude tone, "no, they aren't". So after a few minutes, the waitress finally shows up with the food - and of course its cold. Obviously its been sitting around somewhere for an eternity. My wife had ordered a taco salad and the shell was no soggy it wouldn't even break, it just kinda bent when you tried to take a piece. My food was cold and kinda all run together.  So, we got up and left, giving the manager guy the coupon on the way out. Its not like he hadn't already gotten paid for the coupon so there wasn't much I could do except blog him. He didn't say a word, its was like we were at fault or something. I don't get it. I've travelled a lot and have eaten in a lot of restaurants. This was the worst restaurant experiece I've had in my life. Never, ever, has there been a time even in fast food places where the manager didn't try to make it right by offering something. This guy was a total, complete jerk.  So, if you're in Omaha and you want to find a good place to eat, avoid Trini's like the plague. If you want Mexican I'd suggest Michael's which is just a block off Howard. Otherwise, the Upstream Brewing Company and M's Pub are great. The food is great and the service is outstanding at very reasonable prices.
