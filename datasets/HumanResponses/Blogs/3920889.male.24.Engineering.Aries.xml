      Welcome to another addition of the Pop Culture Awareness, my bitches!  Let's jump into it...   TEST PATTERNS        * Big Brother 5 Watch/Thoughts - Ok, you can hate me or shoot me if you want to...but I have to admire the 4 Horsemen (kudos for the Biblical/wrestling term) alliance of Jase, Scott, Drew, and "Cowboy."  While everyone else is busy hating their guts for various reasons (Jase is a total jock, Scott a vain, loudmouth....jock), I admire them because they were smart to quickly form the perfect form of alliance: a four person voting block, which is just enough.  Past idiots (I'm looking at you Season 4), tried to keep an alliance of 5 or more, thinking that there would never be a problem or hurt feelings somewhere along the line.  Last season, there arose little problems everywhere because each member of the "Non-Ex" alliance (BB fans know who I mean) thought that EVERY OTHER FREAKIN' action would be "going against the original alliance.  You couldn't blame some members for going freaking insane.  The really brilliant part of the Horsemen alliance is that barely anyone makes the connection of "Cowboy" and Drew being in the alliance.  I just hate how everyone gets their feelings hurt when the other side gets hip to their plans.  You're on the chopping block, its part of the game, deal with it.  I swear I'd be the most sedate "housemate" when it came to nominations.  ("You're nominated for eviction Danger."  "Cool...when's lunch?")       *  Last Comic Standing - Loving the show now that Ant is gone...and I know what you're thinking: "You just didn't like him because he's gay."  Yeah, it's soooo simple like that folks.  I didn't like him because he acted like a sneaky bastard and his act consisted of the same 5 jokes.  In fact, I was doing his act along with him by the 3rd week...because I knew which jokes were comming.  The man needs a set, stat.  Preferably ones outside of gay/straight/gender jokes.  It would be like me doing stand up solely about me and my straight preferences.  By the way, I'm totally rooting for Gary Gulman.  He's not only a nice guy, but he has some really great sets and joke delivery.   VIDEO GAME NATION       *  SPIDER-MAN 2 - The best game of the summer so far (btw, all games talked about here are XBOX baby!!!! unless noted otherwise).  It's so much fun to just swing around the city, bouncing off buildings, stopping random crimes, etc.  Check this game out, if you like Grand Theft Auto-type freedom of gaming!       *  XBOX LIVE is a gift from the gaming gods.  50 bucks gets you a whole year's worth of unlimited gaming (with any Xbox Live enabled game).  If you have Live, you must play Splinter Cell 2 and Rainbow Six: 3.  Also just out is the first EA sports game on Live, NCAA Football.  Madden online is just around the corner!   SPINNING DISCS       *  Just a note to all music buyers, Mace, the former Bad Boy artist, has returned to music with a great pre-release track "Welcome Back."  I love that it uses the original tune from "Welcome Back Kotter."  Check this track out now on Apple's iTune's store for only 99 cents!   Well that's all for tonight my friends and readers...just a quick hit of flava'!  - Johnny Danger "Be Pop Cultural Aware"

      See?  Ya' like that?  The twist with the song title and then the coin of phrase?  No?  Eh, well...       And so it begins, yet another couch jockey's attempt to sound off in the sandbox known as the internet.  But thankfully for all of you out there in Web-land, this won't be another political spout-a-thon or a "Well, when I was a boy by 'golly" soapbox ranting blog (Hey, I'm only 24).  No my friends, this is about the fun stuff...the stuff that keeps us enthralled outside of work, politics, and religion (Christian here).  I'm talking about Pop culture and all it's wonderful toys!  Plus any other brain shorting synapses that happen to spout out while writing.  Hey, it happens.  The most I can hope for is that you find this occasional journal well-wrote and most importantly:  ENTERTAINING!  Ok...enjoy.  TEST PATTERNS (Televison)       Ok...Television.  We all watch it.  But me and my friend Tivo?  We double up on that stuff, sho' nuff!  Shows Currently in the Danger man's Tivo coffers:       1.)  BIG BROTHER 5 - If you must know anything about Johnny Danger, it's that I loves' me some reality television.  One of my favorite reality shows is Big Brother.  Now, this was not always the case.  In fact, the first BB alone almost turned me off to watching future editions, it was that boring and insipid.  Thankfully, the producers realized this as well...plus they knew that they had signed a three year deal with show creator's Endermol, so they had to get the ratings up!  After sweeping rule changes, like adding the Head of Household, who nominates two people to kick out (one of which is actually voted out by the rest of the housemates), and other competitions like the Veto competition (still a ridiculous name), the show became full of tension, which in turn made it watchable.  And I've been watching ever since.  This year's version has many twist and turns, like possibly two sets of twins playing as one person, and no one knows this!  If you'd like to get more information on the show and would like to start watching and get a leg up, check out this website (www.realitytvnews.net) which gives constant updates and information.  Also, if you're a broadband freak like me, you can watch what's happening in the BB house 24/7 by signing up for the Live Feed package.  You can watch the roommates anytime, and they do mean anytime!  (Tues, Thurs. @ 9/ Sat. @ 8)       2.)  JOE SCHMOE 2 - Like the great Mel Brooks has always proved, the Spoof is the sincerest form of flatery.  So, when Spike TV decided to do a balls-out parody of reality shows, it went all the way baby!  The first Joe Schmoe was a sometimes uneven, but very enjoyable farce with an unsuspecting guy (or "mark"/patsy/duurrhurrr!) that was surrounded by actors and made to believe that he was actually on a reality show.  Now, the second season ups the ante with two "marks" and twice the fun.  Too bad they didn't count on one of them actually finding out that it's all fake.  C'mon T.V. executives, give us viewers a little credit huh?  No problem...just add a new "player" to the game and all is once again right with the world.  The show is only 3 episodes in, so get to watchin' while you can!  (Mondays @ 11:05pm)       3.)  THE AMAZING RACE 5 - Nothing much to say about this that many critics already have.  It is the best reality show besides Survivor on television.  Every year is great and there hasn't been an off season!  Only two episodes down...check it out now (Tuesdays @ 10pm).  www.cbs.com for Race and Team information!  Some other quick hits of Tivo mania:  Extreme Dodgeball on Game Show Network, WWE Raw (a fan since 8 years old), Trading Spaces (A man's gotta' have a soft side...and Paige Davis), Monster House (I work for a design firm), Simpsons reruns, Last Comic Standing, I Love the 90's, and CSI repeats.   SPINNING DISCS (DVD)  Some recent purchases...       1.)  Blazing Saddles 30th Anniversary Edition - Best.  Comedy.  Ever!       2.)  Noises Off! - A rarely heard of low budget movie with a great cast, including the late John Ritter, Carol Burnett, Christopher Reeves, and Micheal Caine.  Based on a famous British stage play with lots of physical comedy and it's for only 10 bucks at Best Buy!  Sold, American!       3.)  South Park: Season 4 - The series continues to impress, not because of its potty humor (which is fun to any guy with a sense of humor), but because of its thoughts on current events.   ROCK STEADY (Music)       1.)  "Feelin' Kinda' Patton," Patton Oswald - Ok, this is not music, it's stand-up comedy (another one of my passions).  And I guarentee you this...this CD is so funny, you will have to stop it more than once to catch your breath!  I swear...my brother and I had to pause the CD 4 TIMES because we were either choking or having breathing problems.  Stand out tracks include track 19 ("Black Angus...doors lock from the outside fag!") and the track about Robert Evens ("...and a herion drugged Brian Dynahey stormed in and punched me in the solar-plexis, and I shat out those rubix cubes...").  I dare you not to laugh at any of this!!!       2.)  "Contraband," Velvet Revolver - Guns and Roses reborn...minus Axl.  Thank God...   Tell you what my peeps...that will be all for this first edition of the Pop Culture Awareness, cause not only is it getting late here in Atlanta, but I've also worn my fingers out typing.  Plus, a person can only read so much Blog before rebellion moves in (LoL).  Next time, we'll talk TV, Comic books, and the Hottest Ladies of the week!  Love you my beyotches!  - Johnny Danger Pop Culture Awareness
