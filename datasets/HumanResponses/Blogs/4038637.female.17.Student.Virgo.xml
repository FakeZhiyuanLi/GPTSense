      Love you unconditionaly!     Hold your hand during trying times!     Don't talk about you behind your back!     Encourage you to keep trying to reach your goals!     Tell you what you need to hear not necessarily what you want to hear!     Laugh with you, not at you!     Understand your pain!     Give you a part of themselves!     Ask for nothing in return!     Help you see the light!      Don't walk out when trouble walks in!      Stick it out till the end!          Thank You, Friend!      A friend like you, just can't be beat   because you are so very sweet!

      LOVE starts with a SMILE , grows with a KISS , and ends with a TEAR.  DON'T cry over anyone who won't cry over you.  Good FRIENDS are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget.  You can only go as far as you push.  ACTIONS speak louder than words.  The HARDEST thing to do is watch the one you love, love somebody else.  DON'T let the past hold you back, you're missing the good stuff.  LIFE'S SHORT. If you don't look around once in a while you might miss it.  A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover, HARD TO FIND and LUCKY TO HAVE.  Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in it.  BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us.  When it HURTS to look back, and you're SCARED to look ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND will be there.  TRUE FRIENDSHIP "NEVER" ENDS. Friends are FOREVER.  Good friends are like STARS You don't always see them, but you know they are ALWAYS THERE.  DON'T frown. You never know who is falling in love with your smile.  What do you do when the only person who can make you stop crying is the person who made you cry?  Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.  Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then it's not the end.  Most people walk in and out of your life, but only FRIENDS leave footprints in your heart.  Send this on to everyone special in your life, even the people who really make you MAD sometimes  and to the people whose lives you want to be in!!!  And send it back to the person who sent it to you if they mean something to you!!  Remember, every minute spent angry is sixty seconds of happiness wasted.  AWESOME PRAYER:  May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly  where you are meant to be. "I believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly."

      A sad story! But worth thinking  This is a story about a soldier who returned home from Vietnam War. He  phoned his parents once he arrived in San Francisco. Mom, Dad. I'm  coming  home, but I've a favor to ask. I have a friend I'd like to bring home  with  me."Sure," they replied, "we'd love to meet him." "There's something you should know", the son continued, "He was hurt  pretty  bad in the war. He stepped on a land mine and lost an arm and a leg. He  has  no where to go, and I want him to come and live with us."  "I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can find somewhere for him." "No! Mom, Dad, I want him to live with us.""Son," said the father, "you  don't know what you're asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a  terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let  something like this interfere with our lives. I think you should just  come  home and forget about this guy.He'll find a way to live on his own."  At that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing  more  from him.  A few days later, they received a call from the San Francisco police.  Their  son had died after falling from a building, they were told. The police  believed it was suicide.  The grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the  city  morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to  their  horror they also discovered something they didn't know, their son had  only  one arm and one leg.  The parents in this story, like many of us, find it easy to love those  who  are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don't like people who  inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay  away  from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are.  Thankfully, there is someone won't treat us in that way.  Someone who loves us with an unconditional love. There's a miracle  called  Friendship.

      Someone you can be yourself with, and who will overlook your faults.  Someone you can laugh with in good times, and cry with in sad times.  Someone you can share your most intimate secrets with, and with whom you can always be honest.  Someone who's always there when you need them, and who will never let you down.  Someone whose smile can make a world of difference when you're having a bad day.  Someone who's always ready with a hug when things aren't going your way.  Someone who always laughs at your jokes, no matter how bad they are.  Someone who's always willing to listen when you need someone to talk to.  Someone who always says the right things, and is always willing to offer advice... whether you take it or not.  Someone you always feel close to, no matter how many miles are between you

       urlLink    Dream Guy    Your dream is to have the perfect gentleman who is intellectual, more hygienic than you, and probably loves you but needed not say it out loud. He's stable, while you're probably not emotionally-wise.

          Forget each kindness that you do...... As soon as you have done it........ Forget the praise that falls to you....... The moment you have won it.....  Forget the slander that you hear........ Before you can repeat it....... Forget each skight, each spite, each sneer....... Wherever you may meet it.........  Remember every kindness done to you.......... Whatever its measure............. Remember praise by others won........... And pass it on with pleasure............  Remember every promise made........... And keep it to the letter............. Remember those who leand you aid. And be grateful debtor..............  Remember all the happiness that.......... Came your way in living................. Forget each worry and distress............. Be hopeful and forgiving..............  Remember good, remember truth.............. Remember heaven's above you........... And you will find through age and youth......... That many hearts will love you.........  Keep on smiling... Make the whole world as happy as you are. Good Luck.......
