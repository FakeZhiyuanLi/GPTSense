       She's coming home a different woman, Katherine now drinks beer! To celebrate I propose we make plans to visit Brewsters or Savoys or anyplace with with a large diverse beer menu. Of course we don't need to be beer connoisseurs, we could go for $1.50 pints at Filthy McNasty's on a Wednesday.    &nbsp;  In any case, she will be back in four weeks so I suggest we aim for Wednesday, September 1.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?

      It's so nice here! There's tonnes to do: eat, shop, and the nite life is absolutely spectacular!! All the nite life is centered in one area, so it's only one ride...and there's reward for getting in early, which is no cover and the places fill up fast!! The only downside to the T-dot is that it's so busy and humid here. I don't think I could handle that as a hick Albertan :)

       Here is a copy of Dana's Meet Night Email:   &nbsp;   Date: Thursday, July 22    Time: 7:00 PM    Location: Yeoman's Steakhouse, 107 Street and South of Jasper Ave (It doesn't look like much but Shane says they serve the best steak. Also, it is far more accessible than Montana's for those of us without vehicles!)    If you are unsure of where to find Yeoman's Steakhouse, you can meet at Suzanne's place (Douglas Manor on the corner of 83 Ave and 108 St) at 6:15 PM and we can bus over or walk over depending on the mood of those who meet.   Please RSVP to me by next Tuesday, July 20 so I can make reservations. I can be reached via email, or you can phone and leave a message at 721-9092.

      Hey guys, I know I'm not on here much, but my course and everything just finished so I just posted on the other posting that I would like to do the mission in the mall thing if you still need a fourth, however, I'm a little nervous about pledges I dunno I'm really bad at getting them cuz I hate asking people for money.  But anyways, if Dana hasn't already asked her dad or her little sister (very cool btw) I could do it I think.  Also, I'm really sorry I missed fringing, I need to check this more often, but I will try to make it to Emilys for family guy, provided eventually someone emails me her address and times and stuff, and where to park lol!  Talk to you guys later.  Jenna

      I need to stop cavorting with mind-numbing immature 15-year olds.  In other words, please take me away from the Village.  Please!!!!   I was thinking of doing some Fringe-walking/talking next Wednesday.  Maybe even catching a show?  If anyone is interested or has heard of some incredible show, let me know, let me know.

       I think we all should take a moment and welcome Jessica L for FINALLY joining.  Good thing you did cause I was about to start a nasty thread about you which you would only get to read if you joined.  A little trick I learned from some very dirty americans.  Anyway, nice to have you around Jessica L.      ;)

      Hey Ya'll,  Laurie, Emily & I would like to hit Whyte Ave Friday night for a little drinking, probably some dancing and a whole lotta having some fun.  We figure that Whyte Ave would be super cool since all the people from the Fringe will be there.  Emily has already vetoed the Iron Horse.  There are plans for pre-gaming since alcohol is so expense.  Update will be posted once known.  I am guessing pre-gaming will happen at my place since I live on Whyte.  People are also free to spend the night as I do believe some of us are going ot head out to the Fringe the next day.  Hope to hear from you all regarding this matter!!  Cheers and Good Wishes

       We all need some silliness to break up the day. Follow the instructions to find your new name.    The following in an excerpt from a children's book, "Captain Underpants And the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants" by Dave Pilkey. The evil Professor forces everyone to assume new names......    Use the third letter of your first name to determine your new first name: a=poopsie b=lumpy   c=buttercup d=gadget e=crusty f=greasy g=fluffy h=cheeseball i=chim-chim j=stinky k=flunky l=bootie m=pinky n=zippy o=goober p=doofus q=slimy r=loopy s=snotty t=tootie u=dorkey v=squeezit w=oprah x=skipper y=dinky z=zsa-zsa  Use the second letter of your last name to determine the first half of your new last name: a=apple b=toilet c=giggle d=burger e=girdle f=barf g=lizard h=waffle i=cootie j=monkey k=potty l=liver m=banana n  =rhino o=bubble p=hamster q=toad r=gizzard s=pizza t=gerbil u=chicken v=pickle w=chuckle x=tofu y=gorilla z=stinker  Use the fourth letter of your last name to determine the second half of your new last name: a=head b=mouth c=face d=nose e=tush f=breath g=pants h=shorts i=lips j=honker k=butt l=brain m=tushie n=biscuits o=hiney p=chunks q=toes r=buns s=fanny t=sniffer u=sprinkles v=kisser w=squirt x=humperdinck y=brains z=juice

       Hey all,      I think we should enter the "mission in the mall."  it's like amazing race but in west ed.  you collect pledges and try to win.  heck, i suck at explainging this so check out the website.       urlLink www.missioninthemall.com       oooo pretty colours

      So here's a question: What's everyone's "type"? suzanne and I just encountered a hot outdoorsy mountain man(I swear, from the mouth of suzanne) in the office, and whoo! We both had to be hosed down(of course suzanne has dibs). What's everyone else's type? I, personally, am not usually a swarthy-mountain-man type but more of a toned, athletic slim hairy dude type. Any others?

      tuna casserole....Oh yeah! for those who are fans of the Family Guy show, there is going to be a marathon type thing on Fox on august 18 and 25(both wedensdays, from 8-10p) where they show 4 episodes back to back! Fox has decided to let Family Guy air the 4th season in 2005!! Which is friggin awesome because I love that show. Anyways, this is an invite to my apartment on both those days for some Family Guy action. it'll be good times, we can drink beer and act obnoxious like Peter Griffin and say politically incorrect statements. How about it?

      So I have no idea where it will be, but if anyone on the blog is up for wings on Wednesday(aug 4), that would be awesome! It would serve as a buffer just in case Suzanne and her dream man don't hit it off so well :) Joel and some of his friends will also be there, and we're thinking about 8 pm. Interested? let me know emwong@ualberta.ca
