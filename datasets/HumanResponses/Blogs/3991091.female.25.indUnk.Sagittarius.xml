      Title:   Ponzi: The Incredible True Story of the King of Financial Cons Author:  Donald Dunn Grade:  B Brief Comments:  Crazy story of a famous swindler from the early 1900s.  The book goes on for a little too long in the middle, but is a neat look at what the pursuit of riches and fame can cause a person to do.

      Title: A Bend in the Road  Author: Nicholas Sparks  Grade: B  Comments:&nbsp;A love story...A man's wife is killed in a hit-and-run accident. He spends all his time trying to find out who is responsible. Finally, he starts to get over the death and falls in love with someone new. Then, new information comes to light...won't ruin the ending. The last 50 pages of this book are really good. But, it's kind of slow getting to the end. Kind of predictable, but a good beach read.

      Title: The Secret Life of Bees Author: Susan Monk Kidd Grade: A+ Comments: Everyone I know that has read this book loved it. It's about a teenage girl from S. Carolina who accidently shot and killed her mother as a toddler. Her Dad is insufferable and she finally runs away from home. She ends up with a group of sisters who keep bees. The story is basically about her discovering more about her mother and feeling loved for the first time. Read it! (ha ha, I feel kind of like Reading Rainbow!)

      Title: Patron Saint of Liars Author: Ann Patchett Grade: A Comments: I recommend this one. It's about a Catholic home for pregnant girls. I thought the characters were interesting and the plot kept my attention.

      Title: The Magacian's Assistant Author: Ann Patchett Grade: B Comments: I like this author, but this book wasn't my favorite by her. It's about a magacian's assistant who has been in love with the magician for most of her life, unfortunately for her, he's gay. The magician has just died when the book starts. The book is about her dealing with his death and becoming friends with his family. It's worth the read, but might not keep your interest.

      Title: Bel Canto Author: Ann Patchett Grade: A Comments: I thought this book was really interesting. It's about a birthday party held by a South American country&nbsp;for a Japanese executive. The partry is taken over by terrorists that mistakenly believe the president of the country will be at the party. The book is about the interaction between the hostages and the hostage takers. I actually started to empathize with the terrorists in a strange way...

      Title: Family Trust Author: Amanda Brown Grade: C Comments: This is by the same author that wrote "Legally Blonde," so I thought it would be really funny. I was wrong. It was predictable and kind of annoying. It's about a corportate woman and society guy that get custody rights to a little girl when her parents die.

      Title: The Deep End of the Ocean Author: Jacquelyn Mitchard Grade: B Brief Comments: Story about the family of a kidnapped boy.&nbsp; It was a quick read, but I felt like I never got involved with the characters and found some parts hard to believe.&nbsp; Goes on a little too long.

      Title: A Walk to Remember Author: Nicholas Sparks Grade: B+ Brief Comments: Very short read, I finished it in a day. It didn't make me cry out loud, but I did get choked up. I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know how they compare.

      I'm always asking people for book suggestions. But, then I forget to write down the titles they mention. So, I thought this would be a good format for getting friends with like-minded tastes in books to give each other reading suggestions.  Let's use this format...  Title: Author: Grade: (give a letter grade that describes how well you enjoyed the book) Brief Comments:

      Title: Range of Motion Author: Elizabeth Berg Grade: B+ Comments: Story about how a woman copes while her husband is in a coma.  Good story about friendship and hope.  I did enjoy this story, but it was slow at times.

      Title: Barrel Fever: Stories and Essays Author: David Sedaris Grade: C Brief Comments:  This book is by NPR commentator David Sedaris and I had heard that it was really funny, but I found it to be quite crude at times.  But, I really did like the last essay in the book that was about the author's true experience of working as an elf at Macys during Christmastime.  So, I'd grab it at the library and just read the Santaland Diaries portion.

      Title: The DaVinci Code Author: Dan Brown Grade: A Comments: Controversial story about a group of people looking for the Holy Grail based on clues and codes left for them.  If you look at this book as purely a fictional story it is highly entertaining and engrossing.  It has all the twists and turns of a great mystery.

      Title: The Pull of the Moon Author: Elizabeth Berg Grade: A+ Comments: A story about a women who runs away from home during menopause. The chapters alternate between her diary entries and letters to her husband. I love Elizabeth Berg's writing style - she is so truthful and sincere. I find her expressing perfectly things I've thought before but couldn't put into words.
