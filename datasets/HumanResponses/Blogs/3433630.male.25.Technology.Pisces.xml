      It’s crazy how you never know!  You never know whose watching who’s listening and who knows more than you think.  There is no trust amongst family and friends any more.  If there ever was?  I wonder sometimes if that trust that I felt and that bond that I imagined was there ever was.  Was I the blind one?  I believe I was.  I now see a world of liars, cheats, thieves and back stabbers.  No down to earth trust.  Is there even a need to be trusted?  I know that I once had that need.  I would go to the bitter end to prove my loyalty; and what happened I got fucked.  Bent over and shafted.  I chalked it up to bad decisions and tried again.  Once again I'm bending over the railing.  Chalked up, another bad decision.  Down the road I am more cautious now, I watch closely the ones that I least expected…but I was still blind.  I was blinded by my own weakness to want to trust and be trusted.  It may be a natural human need, but it’s a weakness. You see my take on it is everyone is out for themselves.  They will lie and play up to everyone and anyone including the ones they love.  For some reason they have been trained to think like this and it’s unfortunate.  They lack the ability to see the power that comes with numbers, trust and loyalty.  It’s b/c of this trained way of seeing and thinking they will struggle maybe not in the physical means of life but in the mental means.   But what about me?  What about the person who wants to trust and wants to be trusted and loved?  You want to know?  I become cold.  I become trained to no longer let you in.  I develop methods to trick you into feeling like I’m close and you can trust me cause I am only out for myself.  I learn to drown out that desire to trust and be trusted.  I drown out the desire to love and be loved.  I become all those people I despised for hurting me.    I see now, that’s how it happens.    Well fuck that!  I’m better than that.  I am not you!  I am not the lying, cheating, stealing prick you are!  I will be successful and I will not forget those that helped me get there.  I will earn my trust as they will mine.  I will have a team and together we will accomplish great things.  I want to and will see those close to me (though there are few) happy.  I will be able to trust again.  I will be trusted.  Although I will not be fucked b/c you never know who’s watching, who’s listening and who knows more than you!  I will have a family and I will hold them dear to me and teach them all that I can about life.  I will be there for them no matter what the circumstances!  I will never turn my back on them and I will show them a love that no material possession can ever take the place of.  They will be able to trust me……this will be my success!

           I have no idea how this works but I am constantly hearing about it.  So I figured what better way to understand it than to do it.         I dont know what to really talk about and God knows that I got a ton of things I could go off on a tangent with.  I think I'll just read some other blogs and get an idea of whats goin on...
