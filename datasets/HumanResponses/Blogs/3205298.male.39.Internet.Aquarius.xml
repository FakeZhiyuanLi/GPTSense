      So they want to let hybrid cars use the carpool lanes...Big Fucking Deal!!!  What a total waste of time, when our lawmakers have much more serious problems facing this state.  The legislators pass it off as an environmental victory. What total bullshit...I sit in my car everyday on the 91 freeway. (For those of you from So. Cal., you know how it blows.)  I look over and see how little use the carpool lanes actually get.  From what I understand, carpools lanes at most only have 7% of the drivers using them yet the carpool lane is 20-25% of the available capacity of the freeway. So, 93% of the traffic is crammed into 75-80% of the available capacity while 7% of the traffic takes up 20-25% of capacity.  How the fuck is this supposed to help clean air??  93% of us are stuck in a traffic jam, getting 0 miles to the gallon and spewing more pollution into the air because we have to run our engines longer than we otherwise would.   Before anyone sends me comments to complain that I'm some anti-environment bad guy, just let me say that when carpools lanes were first introduced, it seemed like a good idea.  The thinking behind the lanes was, if we offer motorists an incentive to carpool then, traffic will be reduced by having fewer cars on the road due to carpooling.  To be honest, it was an idea worth exploring. After 30 years and billions of dollars spent on it's infrastructure, and with no more use of the carpool lanes than at the beginning of the experiment, I think it's time to say that the lanes didn't work as expected. It's time to end the lanes. The upside is if they do, the state increases highway capacity by 20% for only the cost of the paint to re-stripe the lanes.  Herein ends the rant. You may now go about your day.      urlLink SACRAMENTO / More hybrid cars in carpool lanes?

      As I suspected, I'm not very diligent about updating or writing about anything interesting.  Maybe as I get used to writing again, this will pick up and the quality will improve. So far, the only improvement is that I changed my page design. (What an exciting and colorful life I lead.) My lack of anything resembling a life, may account for the stunning lack of content.  Maybe a bit of info about me is in order.  First off, the name stevgex is from the company I work for.  I do all of the hosting and DNS mapping for my company.  We use Alliegence Internet as out line provider. Their name server is nsf.algx.net. Which we simply call algex.  Whenever there is a mapping or hosting issue, my co-workers refer to it as a stevgex issue. At which point, I resolve the issue and then get back to whatever it was I was doing ( which is usually just looking busy.)  Hence, the name Stevgex.  Though my plan was to use this blog to rant about stuff that annoys me, so far no good rants have occured to me.  But, I do feel one about carpool lanes building up. Well see...

      I've never really checked out blogs before now.  Of course, I have heard of them. I just have not looked into them until now.  I like to ramdomly surf to whatever link on a page catches my attention for even a moment.  Of the course of a couple hours, I find I have seen and read a lot of things that I wouldn't usually have thought about before.  Last night, I ran across blogs writen by Iraqis with thier own personal stories about the events we only get to see after someone at a TV network has decided we should see.  The authours accounts present a very different picture than CNN or any of the US media outlets.  I found 3 blogs that are worth checking out.  Check them out it's pretty cool.  urlLink Where is Raed ?   urlLink iraq the model   urlLink the messopotamiana

       urlLink Politics News Article | Reuters.com  Oh My God!!! Could people be any more thin skinned?  Wah wah, Boo Hoo.  So Arnie calls congressman who are in the back pockets of special interests "girlymen" because they lack the balls to stand up and tell their constituents who they really represent.  And, now the Democrats in Caifornia's legislature are proving Arnie point.  The Democrats are whining and crying about being called "girlymen" and trying to make an issue of it.  Showing everyone in the process they are in fact "girlymen". If you can't handle a simple jab in the politcal game or in any other arena for that matter, stay in your house because, your fragile physche won't be able to handle being out in the world unsupervised.

      Here somthing that my Dad emailed me that I thought was made some good points.  At least a little food for thought....           This should be an  eye opener for the one's that don't understand what's going on in the world  today. For the ones who read this and don't understand, Please re-set the snooze  button, go back to sleep, so the ones that are concerned about this country can  deal with this problem and get rid of it for ever!  One thing for sure is that  they want to       KILL       you, your family  and destroy the world as we know it.

      The Philippines give into terrorists who are no mre than common dime store street thugs.  The Philippino government now has no credibility on the world stage. From this point forward, they will always be dealing from a position of weakness.  The world now knows that the Philippines will cave into anyones demands just by threatening them a little bit. How sad for it's people. Their desion shows that the Spainish colonial influence still hold sway. urlLink International News Article | Reuters.com
