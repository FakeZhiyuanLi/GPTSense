      another day......but it is her FRIDAY...... smiles......... lana is off for the next four days..... smiles.....lana went last thurs and met her Dom friend.... her breasts are heavily bruised.... but she knew it would be like that before she met Him, as she has played with Him before... *eg*...this Dom can reach her head space totally.... but  He will never be nothing more than just an occasional play Dom... but oh , He is totally DOM...... lana has known Him for a couple of yrs now... He mentioned that He will be getting married in June....so He will be retiring..... lana rubs her chin and thinks about it..... lana will miss Him...                                 lana's training Master released her......as lana typed in one of the last posts..... she still talks to Him..... :=)  lana does not want this Man out of her life...... He has made a great impact in her soul.....this Man has reached her heart......but lana realizes that He is married.....lana is totally at ease with that...... but it totally overwhelms her at how much she cares for Him.....   well, lana is going to run into the chat rooms for a bit...... lana started talking to a Master FalconTrainer today ..from alt........... dont know on how that will turn out...... He is way far...... up north somewhere........ ~~lana~~

        My Immortal. Your Lyrics   I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating light Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me    urlLink   What Evanescence song are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      lana has been released by her training Master... His doings....... lana feels lost.... although she still communicates with Him during the week... lana is confused now..and does not know much..... so she does not feel like entering much in her journal today.  ~lana~

      ~~ a new day, a  new way of thinking~~ lana's Master spoke of some things today ..... lana is thinking about asking release.  but lana finds it so hard to actually do.  it is really hard to describe. and lana hates HATES to do this cyber online Gor...... lana craves R/T , a real Master who can spend time with her.  lana will be patient. and work on herself before she ever attempts to find a Master.  lana's eyes glaze as if daydreaming,  she knows that when it is meant for her to have a Master.....He will indeed come into her life.     lana is rather depressed now.  her son is about to drive her nuts.   she does not know how to reach Him.  constant battle... it is.   lana~~
