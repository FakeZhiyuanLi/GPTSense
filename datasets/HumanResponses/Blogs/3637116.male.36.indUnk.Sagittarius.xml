       ND Omnibus Reunion 2004 Report   After months of having the reunion catalog sit partially filled out in my briefcase, Oonie and I decided to go out to Notre Dame. While I'll even tell my family and other friends that the holdup was testing Ryan's temperment for long car rides, that is only partially the case--the major holdup was my own mixed emotions about the place. I'll cut to the chase and say--it was a good time. Perhaps not transformative, but not as awful or anxiety-provoking as I thought it might be. In fact, at this point I'm tending toward heading out for as many of these as logistics & life allows.   The thing that made me want to pile into the car was our astute trip planning--in particular, planning to hit as many baseball games as possible. Our route had potential stops at Pittsburgh, Akron, Toledo, and (of course) South Bend. I figured if I hit two parks, it'd be a mitzvah (can something be a mitzvah as part of a Notre Dame reunion trip?). Plans were flexible, and ballgames being long events, it made it easy to get to. Life's better when you don't stress about getting to see the first pitch anyway. Framing road trips around baseball is an excellent way to travel and I highly recommend it. In some ways I am kicking myself at all those buttbuster rides wasted on turnpikes when I could have found out about places like Fort Wayne, Toledo, Akron, Altoona, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, &c. In addition I would have had some idea of what the pre- Bull Durham  minor leagues looked like.   Thursday: PNC Park, Pittsburgh   We left Thursday and took in the Pirates-Cardinals at PNC Park; stayed overnight at Oonie's roommate's parents' house (follow that?). I can't tell you how wonderful this park is and how much more Pittsburgh got for their $500 million than Philadelphia. TV doesn't do it justice. It faces the downtown area, right across the river, so these buildings loom large and close behind the outfield wall; it looks like some sort of stage backdrop for a city scene in a high school play. Riverboats cruise by and blow their whistles while everyone waves. The public walkway by the river is the lowest sidewalk level, and it gradually terraces up to the gates and concourse level, where there are picnic areas, etc., and multiple places to perch and watch the game from the outfield. In the infield the same principles apply--there are two main concouse areas, but lots of 1/2 and 1/3 levels off of them with various features and things to do--a children's play area, boxes, a souvenir store, a microbrew bar, etc. Elevators are numerous and big and attendants are friendly. I think its capacity is around 40,000, and this year it struggles to fill it halfway, which is a real shame, but understandable in some ways as the team sucks and does stuff like #1--signing Raul Mondesi in the first place, and then #2 -- letting him walk to Anaheim by constructing some cock-and-bull story about personal safety without getting a thing in return. I'm not sure Pirates GM Dave Littlefield would have gotten as gentle a ride in Philadelphia for that.   The sports complex area is like Philadelphia in that the two stadia are close to one another, but the area itself is far closer to its downtown. So while on the one hand there's a 4-block island of parking in between PNC and Heinz Field (the Steelers' park), the Roberto Clemente Bridge (the yellow steel girder one--very striking & pedestrian only during game days) brings you right from the downtown to the center/left field side and third base entrance of PNC, and there's lots of  new development there--a new Marriott, nice-looking bars and restaurants, trendy offices. The overall effect you get is this vast diorama spread out before you from upper deck infield seats: field (with reasonable and interesting dimensions, btw), a pedestrian bridge, riverboats cruising by, the buildings changing from twilight to nighttime. It's quite beautiful. The game was interesting only in that Pirates manager Lloyd McClendon, sick and tired of having his players hit (the Cubs recently hit 11 Pirates while his pitchers wussed out and retaliated once), went after Tony Larussa after a Pirates reliever threw high and tight to Pujols (I think) and TL whined to the umpire. Benches cleared and shoves exchanged--it was the first one of those I had witnessed in a long time and perhaps the first where it was simply between two managers. Talk about generational differences in the game anymore.  One side note. We stayed in Irwin with Oonie's former Penn roommate Linda's parents. Neither one of us knew that Linda was a baseball card collector in her youth. She had complete sets from prime years of our childhood--1974-1982. What a memory lane of great names.     Friday: Onward to Notre Dame   After a few long trips in the car, we're getting pretty good at travelling with an infant and tuning into his patterns. After the morning routine of clothes, floor time, and breakfast, we can put Ryan in the carseat (around 9 a.m.), where he's good for maybe 30 mins. of quiet awake-time, then 2-2 1/2 hours of sleep. Then it's about time for a stop anyway for all of us. So we repeat the cycle and drive on. He's good for two solid cycles. The third one tends to be whiny, but I can't disagree with the kid. He travels like a champ.   Been a while since I drove the Ohio Turnpike--very nice--done a lot of work, and from the Cleveland area out to Toledo is now a 6-lane highway at 65 mph--which telescopes the trip quite a bit. As for Pennsylvania, you can pretty well avoid the entire area around Pittsburgh, which is under construction. Still, there's that piece from Toledo to the border of Indiana that just feels like forever.   In the late afternoon we arrived on campus. For those who haven't seen the new Eck Center--Alumni office and bookstore complex just south of the Morris Inn--yikes! Lavish, nice--both needed in some respects, but ay carumba.  I appreciated the quasi-religious architectural touches in both buildings--in the Alumni Center, a painted blue and gold starry sky in the cathedral ceiling; in the bookstore, quasi post-and-beam supports and nice big ceilings for sweatshirt display. It straddled that line of Notre Dame campus architecture that either takes itself way too seriously or had a designer at the CAD workstation with tongue firmly in cheek. Either way, it's a bit of a laugh to think that an architect with way too much earnestness or a wry sense of humor pocketed some of that money.   As for accommodations, we hadn't made any solid arrangements, but once there wound up staying on campus in Morrissey. We had thought of staying with Prof. Dan McKenna's sleep lab--he studies families who co-sleep/sleep share with infants, but when we finally got around to confirming we wanted to go, the lab was booked. Oh well.   We went into the Eck Center to register for reunion events. Registration is a confusing aspect of reunion--there's the package deal that gets you into everything, but there's an amazing bit of it that is all a la carte. The alumni association's publications either soft-pedal this or miscommunicate it--or both. You really can just pick and choose what you want to go to, which saved quite a bit of money; had I thought it completely through and not factored in Oonie to the beer tent tickets, it could have been even more.   Once inside the door, we happened upon Kathleen Quinn and John MacNamara. John's a former London flatmate who now lives in LA, and his name on the "Who's Coming?" website helped push me over the edge. He's got a bit more of a reason to be tremendously conflicted about his time at Notre Dame, but was his typical hilarious self. While I tried to get a straight answer from the very earnestly helpful folks about a la carte vs. package options, Oonie, Kathleen and John chatted away. John also reported that he had looked up Molly (Burd) Galo on the list and called her to see if she and Matt were coming--I knew Matt was on the fence, but I think John helped pull Molly in too. So with their visit on the table, I decided we'd stay through Sunday morning (our original option was to head out Saturday afternoon to go see the Toledo Mud Hens Saturday night, in a vague effort to get back to PA on Sunday night). Also at the Eck Center I ran into Roz of layout/Scholastic fame. She looks remarkably the same; beyond some pleasantries,  however, I never really found out what she was up to. Ryan, meanwhile, charmed two girls over to his stroller (the second willfully lifted herself out of her own stroller to come over for a visit) in what would be a weekend of fawning attention from folks I'd never seen smile at me as an undergraduate--security officers, cafeteria workers, priests, ND administrators. He got way more action on campus in 30 minutes than I did in a much longer time frame--but then again, he was born with a clue.  We hit the shuttle vans and went over to Morrissey. This dorm has a reputation for small rooms and lived down to it. The hall attendant moved out a wardrobe in our room. That left us with one wardrobe, two desks, and a bunkbed. We had just enough space for Ryan's crib, but needed to go outside to change our minds. That was fun to do...once.  Headed over to the class dinner at North Dining Hall. Tom Varnum was the emcee, but despite my best efforts to goad him into becoming the class's formal Don Rickles-style insult comic, he played it straight, only once getting in some sidelong shots at Digger Phelps when we heard he was speaking at the '94 dinner in the other room. Otherwise, the class dinner had the feel and sound of a union hall. As a group, I suppose the class of '89 has some ways to go toward achieving old guard decorum. Bob and Heather Kuehn showed up wearing nametags that read "Kuehn" despite a recent name change that Americanized it to "Keane," which is, of course, her idea. And a fine one it is.   At the beer tent afterwards, caught up with Ann Biddlecom, who was off to the races talking about how a group of Yale alumni solicited donations from their class and withheld them from the school until their 50th reunion. We were then immersed in a sudsy discussion of replicating the effort, calling it "Club $89!"--the idea being we would set up a shadow fund and withhold it from the university until our 50th, whereupon we would donate it for a specific purpose--a co-ed dorm, perhaps, or a clubhouse for GLNDSMC. As premiums for our members, we would set up "The Real Class Notes"--filled with unsubstantiated rumors about our classmates.    Saturday: ND a-go-go	   Made it to breakfast at South Dining Hall before the doors closed--but not so late (like the morning marathoners) who came in only to find the event broken down and the food wheeled away. Ah. la plus ca change. Anyway--the middle part (where food was dispensed) at South Dining Hall has been transformed into a Food-Court a-rama. Tom and his wife LeeAnn had more of an experience there, having weathered a lunch there the day before--but it is chock full of food stations and neon signs. Mercifully they had left the eating halls unchanged. Because of the additional dorms built on the back 9, the back of it has been built out and prettified, with some additional dining area.   We hit the class picture. Tom Varnum and I were told later by our wives that we were among the younger-looking of our classmates, which is of course both the point of the photo and one of the benefits of marrying nice wives. Apparently working for Arthur Anderson/Accenture wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.  So: Bookstore, picnic, then Tom and I actually hit a seminar on newspapers, given by this guy who is the "ND Student Press Coordinator." He was generally thoughtful, but like so much administrative thought regarding press at ND, seemed like he was about 20 years behind the times. The main points of his seminar, which would have been great, say, for an introductory high school journalism class (Tom got some good handouts out of the deal), were:  ·	It's hard to choose stories to highlight on the front page of newspapers. Lots of people feel differently about different stories. ·	There are many touchy ethical calls to make on stories you run. It's kinda neat to think about.  ·	Is the press liberal or conservative? Discuss.   In essence--this was Jack Powers' class syllabus 17 years ago. It was fun to see some generational fault lines. Some old heads in the classroom could be summed up with the following thought balloon perpetually over their heads: "The press is too damn liberal!! Why don't they just own up to it and say so??" My own thought balloon was: "Arguing about front pages of newspapers is not unlike arguing about how many angels dance on the head of a pin." Yes, interesting--but no, not the high frontier of journalism.   I wanted to get into a discussion about this guy's role at the school, which in my mind would have been far more interesting, but we were late already for the Londomer reunion.   Yep, You Read that Right: Londomer Reunion   Off Tom and I trundled to the Hesburgh Center. The crowd had already been shepherded into an auditorium by Stacie Gutting, who was holding forth over PowerPoint slides with the following theme: Things are way, way better now in the London Program than when you were there. I'd say this was reassuring, but for the transition I made there to crusty old alum: I was a bit conflicted--ah, hell, no I'm not--here's my issue: things are in fact so good at the London Program that you don't really have to step outside and see London. This may be a bit of an understatement, but like the home office, the program has an interesting main current and riptide: the main current is constant improvement in facilities--which will in essence make it easier to go to school there. The riptide is--realizing this, the program makes more of an effort to set up internships and such to help force the kids out. It's a strange dichotomy, seemingly experienced only by program staff as, "hey look! More cool stuff for us to do!" Plans are now in place for a year-long option. I'm hoping that by the time Ryan's ready to go there's a four-year option.   Dr. Gutting had good material, but ran waaaaay too long with too...much...detail. People eventually started leaving the auditorium to connect with friends and pick over the meager refreshments. While most went onto the class dinner, we went instead to Stanley Covaleski Stadium to seen the South Bend Silverhawks take on the Cedar Rapids Kernels in some exciting Class A Midwest League action.   On the way back from that we walked into the Alumni-Senior Club, aka "Legends." We were about to order drinks, but the barkeep saw Ryan and had to bounce him. No joke. No minors in the bar area. They've renovated the place into a cross between a Mariott lounge bar and a TGIFriday's  (on the left side). On the right side, it's the "Club ND" side--with a "none more black" decor: dark gray tile, black walls, black furniture. Must be thrilling to be there in February. OK, some plusses: the Club ND side is clearly multifunctional, and can host non-alcoholic events. It's more integrated into the campus, so you don't need to walk through a deserted parking lot to get there. And the beers on tap are varied and ..., well, now there are beers on tap. But on the left side, the lounge bar/restaruant--way too scrubbed up and "neat." Once again Notre Dame fails to construct a college bar for itself that would include wood, brick and chock full of memorabilia.    South Bend Silverhawks and Stanley Covaleski Stadium   Stanley Covaleski Stadium is a fairly run-of-the-mill minor league experience cursed with a lot of potential. This park opened in 1988 while I was at Notre Dame, and its construction history eerily shadowed the Chicago White Sox' (at the time the team's parent) corruption-ridden New Comiskey, a.k.a. Cellarlar Field, --lots of graft, union corruption, shady concrete figures, backroom dealings, etc. They put the "Cove" downtown, next to a beautiful railroad station where trains don't stop anymore (the one that does that is way out of town in a nightmarish 70s Amtrakconcraption), and close to the Studebaker Museum. If it were supposed to have been a catalyst for improving downtown South Bend, well, it's not unlike the guys in Emergency 51! trying to use the paddles when the battery in the rig is dead. In any case, a Silverhawk is a kind of Studebaker car--I think their sportscar--so you'd think of easy stuff--like using a vintage one to ferry relievers in from the bullpen, or rolling them across the warning track during opposing team pitching changes, sound effects such as the roar of an engine, architectural flourishes and memorabilia from Studebaker--but, ah...no. Instead we had darn near inedible hot dogs, 90 miles east of the hot dog capital of the world. The 'Hawks are now the class A affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who play in the uber-impressive Bank One Ballpark (soon to be renamed) in Phoenix.  What did they have? Some nimrod with a digital audio sampler who plays these little sound jokes after almost every pitch (Homer Simpson here, slide whistle there, breaking glass), completely unaware that most people in attendance don't really know the game, and some of those who do (such as myself) are not at all vested in the outcome. I found myself expending effort to figure out some of the jokes, but then immediately resented it as a waste of time. Annoying as hell. Anyway, it was there where I had an epiphany about why I dislike the Midwest; it is as follows: Whereas:   ·	In Philadelphia, there is much distinctive about the place, and yet its inhabitants continue to think of it poorly;  ·	In the Midwest, there is nothing distinctive at all, and yet its inhabitants consider it paradise.    Now--this is more true of South Bend than, say, Chicago--there is plenty distinctive there, but even there Chicagoans will tell you about their distinctiveness in excruciating detail. It took me nearly 20 years of close observation to get me to this realization. I did hear later that the Cove has a good brew pub somewhere inside it, but I missed it entirely.    Saturday Night Beer Tent   I caught up a bit with John MacNamara, Matt and Molly Galo, and had a nice time telling Heather Kuehn all about Bob. I regaled the Kuehns and Varnums with my story of the freshmen lesbian relationship I discovered in their journals at the private Catholic girls' school I taught at for a semester, without a doubt the best story I have from teaching. It was a lovely evening spent blathering on, catching up, and drinking Rolling Rock (wtf? they need some better beer choices there).   Toward the end of the evening, who did Tom and I run into but Ann Belaski, whom I remember most as my co-star in a tremendously boozy Thames Cruise toward the end of the London Program. My subliminal mind was working on overdrive, as when I saw her I immediately got her name wrong (z snaps for you, subconscious!). She had come down to the reunion from Chicago on the advice of a friend who was helping her through a recent bout with unemployment, which I thought took a fair amount of guts. She is brighter and better than the lot in life she's gotten so far--unfortunately, little seems to have changed much since that article in ND mag some years ago about crushing student debt and working in educational publishing. I told her I'd put her in touch with Dan Barrett, who works in those mines. She also said she was looking for a man, so who knows, she could get the Danny B. package!  She spent some time with Tom and me reliving a Penn State weekend episode in which she got so drunk she threw up on Tom's mother as they brought her back into the dorm, which resulted in some cautionary but firm hall discipline (and as a 37-year-old I thought was perceptive of them, albeit in retrospect probably not *enough* of an intervention). I realized that the Penn State weekend our senior year needs to be the topic of a kind of anti-Nicholas Sparks novel. Anyway, the entire episode got me hooked onto ND reunions--just that half hour alone was chock full of a tremendous mix of humor, pity, irony, schadenfreude and--most notably--relief.   Sunday afternoon: Fifth Third Field, Toledo: Home of the Mud Hens   Our last game of the trip was Sunday afternoon at Fifth Third Field in Toledo (the strange name is the fault of a local bank, Fifth Third), home of the Toledo Mud Hens, the real-life favorite team of fictional TV character Max Klinger. M*A*S*H* must have been a tremendous boon to this franchise, and give them credit for applying that money in lots of great ways. This is a tremendous baseball experience--one of the best parks I've ever seen and a rocket shot to #1 minor league experience (so far division) in a dead tie with Reading. It ameliorated many of my bad feelings about the Midwest. The ballpark is new (2002), but like Pittsburgh shows evidence of actually being a catalyst for downtown development (though a bit less so; as we were there on a Sunday afternoon it was hard to get a feel for this). There's also background/behind-the-scenes infrastructure that I've never quite seen before. For kicks, play around with ordering Mud Hens tickets on the Internet--not only can you choose your section, but you'll get a screen where you can pick your own seats. This is great for people like us, who now prefer to sit in the last row on the aisle near the concourse because of the baby.   But the stage show/game was great too. They have classic uniforms and some great-looking merchandise--a huge store and they must move a ton of stuff. Their players also wear the over-the-calf socks, which is a great look imho. The field is pristine--we actually got to run the bases after the game. Their catcher just about single-handedly won the game--Mike DiFelice--whose career I need to look up. At least on that day, he had a good bat and also calmed down his late-game relievers during one of the worst home plate umpiring performances I've ever seen (both managers ejected for arguing balls and strikes, and the Pawtucket Red Sox passively aggressively punished the guy after their manager got tossed with the catcher visiting the mound on just about every batter).  The Phils could probably make good use of him if he's blocked by Pudge.
