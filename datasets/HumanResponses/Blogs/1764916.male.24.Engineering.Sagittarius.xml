       urlLink movabletype.org  produced a great tool to make blog. However, I don't have the server to put it on. Probably I will spend some money on webhosting as soon as I get a job offer.   :)

       urlLink  LiveJournal.com   It's a blogging world now. There is a book about how to blog and how wonderful blog is and how it changed the way people interact with Internet and the world. There are so many blogging site. To make it easier to read the blogging,  urlLink  Noah Grey   created a Greymatter. All those wonderful things make me want to be a writer and share my thoughts with the world by blogging down something I think and feel on a daily basis.   The interesting thing about the discovery of blogging is that I found my gaydar so accurate sometimes. As soon as I opened the website of Noah Grey, I think this guy must be gay. The site is so beautifully and artistically constructed. You would probably think he is just some stupid artist who only know how to make things look nice. Wrong! He is quite a technical savvy. The Greymatter he created changed the way people update information on the website. Surprisingly, he can also write! There are so many poetic pieces on the website altogether with the fantastic photographs. What a talent! He reminded me of someone I checked recently. He is  urlLink Matthew Barney . The series of movies he created is called  urlLink Cremaster . The picture is aesthetic and repealing. Plus, he is the actor, sculptor, athlete, director, dancer.... There are so many people who have tons of talent, yet, they are still working hard to achieve more. They are the role models.  I respect you guys. :)

      Finally get the work persmission card today from INS. I actually thought those guys will mail it to my apartment. Fortunately, ISSS called me today to respond my inquiry about OPT status. I figured it might be there. It WAS! Now, I really need to put more efforts into job hunting with the skills Callie told me today.   Go though Alumni and Dore2dore website. Also find job information through Nashville Chamber of Commerce. It sure will make the job hunting perspective a lot better. Hope it works.   There was a program tonight on CBS's 60 Minutes II, Dean Kamen, the inventer of SEGAWAY, revealed his life, his invention, his passion about technology. That's exactly what life is about. The happiness of doing what you enjoy is the most wonderful thing in the world. Dean Kamen, you are the MAN!   Again, I didn't try to make the relationship work with Huawei. I think sometime this weekend I will have a talk with her and get things straightened out. I understand she is nice, and sometimes it's my problem to take things in the wrong way. However, I don't want her to attack me for no reason and she need to understand what's her position and what's her role in the relationship.

      Huawei returned yesterday and I didn't try to talk to her. I don't think I would positively seek to talk to you in the future any more simply because we are not on the same wavelength. Nobody's character can change at this stage of life. So..., just let it be.  No more conflict and no more fight. Just be quiet and keep mouth shut. That's the best solution so far. We'll see how far this strategy will go.   I went to Express yesterday and bought some really cool clothes. I think the new wardrobe started from yesterday. Although I still don't have nice shirt to match the new jeans, it's okay since it's already a good start. Expect a preppier Yun soon. :)  After expecting the last episodes of THE AMAZING RACE 4, my favorate team Chip and Reichen won the game!! Hurrah! It's been an exciting and anxious week. Considering RC keep making mistakes before in every leg of the race and always come up as the second place, it's hard to have too much confidence to them to win the race. However, they did win! My excitement is beyond words. :)   The bad news also came with the season finale of the race. I already felt R&C were not a couple anymore through the messeges in bullitin board, other interviews, and the hints from the pictures on TV and internet. The ring is gone and they two are "kind of" seperated. I'm pretty sad to see that happen. However, they are just normal couple and need to work on the problems in their relationships. Hopefully, this two handsome studs will get back together and enjoy the one million dollars they won in the amazing race 4.   Nonetheless, I have learned a lot from those guys and have a much positive attitude towards life although i'm still bewilded about what I'm going to do in the near future. The good attitude is a great start.   As what many successful people said in their books, a long term goal and short term plan is the KEY to be successful. That's very true. The long term goal should be set right now with deliberate consideration. Let the new life starts now.

      yesterday is the 3 year anniversary of staying in U.S.   I spent the night alone. But to make things a little bit happier, I cooked a dilicious dish and devoured it. :) Chicken is so tender and green peper is awesome with a spicy jalapeno twist.   It's been three years and lots of changes happened. I'm moving in a good direction. God help me to be a better person.

      Today sucks. So depressed still from yesterday's fight with Huawei. She did that again and begin to humiliate me by saying very heinous words.  I told her that was it. I would't take it any more.   It's better stay away from that bitch anyway.   Then I spent the whole day watching TV and movies. Aimee and Jaguar tells a very touching love story about lesbians during wartime. The true love and true color of human being is revealed completely. After depressed afternoon, I watched "I am Sam". It's an overall touching film. However, the part that make me feel so close to is the confession Michele Pheifer made to Sean Penn's character "Sam". Everybody expect the successful lawyer who has everything she wanted in the world to be happy, and a guy like Sam will be living a miserable life for not being intelligent. However, the reality is the greedy part of human being eat up all the good things, and unfortunately, most people don't realize it until a guy whom nobody expect to teach them lesson taught an important part of being human being---Love. Love family, love kids, love friends, love the people who deserve it.   I have been watching many movies like this and I believe they completely changed my view of life and human being. However, it's still a huge task for me to put the lessons and tips I learned from those movies into real life. I'm writing down those thoughts right now and hopefully I will read it later on and found the true meaning of the life and the way to apply in my own life.

      It's a bad day again, I had a huge fight with Huawei. She really sucks sometimes although she is a good person. Woman are just very bitchy and they tends to nagging all the time. I was so tired of letting her tell me what to do while she had no idea of what the thing really should be. That pissed me off. Anyway, she came back in the afternoon and we had a talk and laughed at it a little bit. I'm sure it will happen again. The difference between us make it that way and there is no remedy for it, well, unless one of us changed the way I/she behave.   I was a little bit depressed after bickering with her and felt really lonely. So I scrolled down the phonebook on my cellphone trying to find someone to talk to. It's not easy.... Just as usual, after scrolling it several times and I decided to call Xiaomei. We talked for about 20 minutes and catching up with each other's business. However, I doesn't feel that she care much about what's going on in my life although I sincerely care about her (maybe she didn't feel it, but I do like her as a friend.) I could be part of the problem since I don't usually know how to deal with a person properly and how to maintain a longterm relationship. My temper sucks... God help me to control  it, please. The random talk ended with no comfort on my side and she went back to clean up her room, which she probably would like to do rather than talk to me.   Afterwards, another scrolling process started and Bill's number was locked in and I thought for a second whether I should talk to him or not since he really offended me last time when he was in Nashville and tring to have sex with me (or as he said, keep options open, yeah, whatever... he is just a normal horny dog.) However, the urge to talk to someone pushed that button and the phone was connected. He was apparently very surprised and happy about me calling him. We talked for a long time about everything in our lifes. It was a great conversation, the kind of conversation that I long to have with somebody for quite a long period of time. He is still very active in dating scene and flirting with young guys. I truely admire his confidence and his courage to fight the odds. That really motivate me somewhat to move my life forward. Although I don't have a chance (or not willing to) bring up the fight with Huawei, it's okay. At least I talked to someone that cares about me as a person in this world. It felt wonderful. I'm glad that I decided to call him and avoided my normal wrong behavior of cutting people out from my life once they did something, even small thing, wrong. Kudos to me:)  Sunday's TV is usually very boring. Fortunately NBC arranged one reality show on Sunday and I can spend sometime to enjoy it.  The poor guy, I forgot his name, broke his arm and was asked to go back to restaurant a few times and rejected when he arrived. Rocco really don't like him and just want him out of the space that he has. I don't blame him doing that. But it just really hurt that dude's feeling and I don't know how he could take it. I wish they had interviewed him and give him a chance to express his feeling about what the management team had done to him. At the same time, he is very perseverant. I really need to use that to power myself in the job hunting process. As Huawei said, I have been like this for a year and haven't done much. It's really not what a young man like me should do. The power and money don't just come in handy and I need to work my ass off for it.  I always blamed the bad luck to the unlucky year. Too superstitious, but hey, it's true.  God bless me and turn my life around. I need to see the big change in my life and everyone in my family need to see it. Let's start from tomorrow.   Make a plan and goal and manage to achieve it. Let's do it.  now, have a good night sleep.

      I took out those greatest moments from the Amazing Race 4. very touchy moments.  ________________________  Greatest Moments from TAR4  EPISODE 1   1. Reichen and Chip with Debra and Steve: Share room and battling about coming out in the race.  Chip offered to share room with Debra/Steve. "You are gonna be out in the cold tonight, that was not gonna happen. we are all in the room together. "  Debra: You have the feelings that the boys want to sleep together? (Reichen: We are gay couple, you know? chip and I, we have not made the decision still whether we are gonna let anyone on this race know if they haven't figure it out already.") Debra: This is not exactly the way I intended. But I can sleep with three guys. So maybe in the long run, this works out OK. (Debra: He was mad at himself because we could have get the hotel room a hour earlier. ) Debra: Oh, you are so cute.... (touching Steve's hair) (Steve: I was upset, because I know she is upset. Because she is my main focus, no matter what.) (Debra: Whe he cries, it's just....(teary eyes), I knew he was crying because of me.) Debra: I love you so much.   2. Steve and Dave: Knee Injury  -you are doing great! -you are being sarcastic. we are okay, we are gonna make this.  -You made it -I owe you, man. I wouldn't won this race with anyone but you, man. Nobody beat you.   3. Debra and Steve: Crossing cable  S: you are more than half way, baby. you are really doing great. You are so good. D: Let me get there. S: There you go.     4. Debra and Steve: Elimination S: despite the emotional and physical damage we did to ourselves, we had a great time. D: Because of you, I get things that I think I can never do in my life. It's just wonderful. I love you. (kissing Steve) (D: I think he is very proud of me today.  S: What's most important to me is Debra, the fact that I am gonna get to spend everyday with her in the rest of my life with her, that's what really matters to me.

      The Guys, the play by Anne Nelson was on Ingram Center tonight. I went to see it. Actually I didn't know what it was about before I got into the theatre. So I used the interim before the play started to find out that it's a tribute to the firefighters after the tragedy happened on September 11, 2001. The two actors performance carries out the scars and emotional disturbances of the people who did their work and lost their closest friends and family members. Any ordinary characters displayed in it can be found in everyone's life. There is always that average Joe doing his own things. You guys fight and just doing usual stuff. But as soon as he is guy, you began to realize how terrific this person is by retrospect the life. The firefighters are great. Solute to them.    Accidentally, there was a huge fire took place in a nursing home the day before the play was on. Some people lost their lives in the burning down building. A lady mentioned in a very sad and peaceful manner during the Q&A session to bring everyone into reality and also connect everyone to the play.  I meant to talk to the white-haired lady as I stepped out of the theatre, but I didn't do it as usual. :(  I went to work out this morning and met David again. It's a little bit awkward again. But I just pretend to be normal and cool doing my workout. After a while, he came back complaining his webhosting service is crap and the service provider is not providing any assistance. I figured out he knew nothing about those web publishing thing. So I offered to help him out as a way to know him better. He called me about five hours later during my little nap time and ask me to meet him somewhere on campus. I was glad he called. Then I drove there and went to the computer lab with him. It took me no time to figure out things for him and get things done. I can tell he was really excited and amazed to see how I do those HTML coding thing. He encouraged to really start to doing the webdesigning thing and make money out of it. Very good advice. I think I am gonna do it and make that happen. I probably need some small business advice from someone or some book. Whatever it is, hope it works out okay.

      I got up really early considering I went to bed very late last night. It's gonna be the job fair day. So I drove to Staples and got some professional resume paper and printed some resumes out. Today is the deadline for the production design assistant position in CMT. I decided to submit my resume with coverletter to them directly. That took me a good 2 hours to do that. It's time consuming, but i felt good. Because I can feel the difference and people can see the difference in my efforts to pursue the jobs. good luck to me on the job fair and other job applications.

      I talked with Wang Jing in Louisana. It's been a long time since we talked last time. I found out that he got an offer to work as a postdoc in UPenn. It is a great news, plus he will be closer to Peter that way. Good for both of them.   His experience in finding a job is not easy either. He sent out over 150 letters to companies and he did get some interviews, but no one offered him a job until this UPenn offer came though. He passed his darkest period finally. He courage me to work hard to find a job and never gave up. I thank him for the encouragement. That is a power source in the job hunting.   Another interesting experience today is in the rec center. I was thinking about the guy who is usually very polite around 1:30pm before workout. I actually plan to work out just because I think he will show up around that time on Saturday. The funny thing is that, as soon as I walk into the weight room, he is done with the lateral pulldown machine. He saw me and said, "what's going on, man?", which is longer than what he say most of time--"how are you doing?" Interesting change. I kind of feel he want to say something more, but since I was so shy that I pass him by after quickly responding "fine, thanks".  The more I think about it, the more I feel excited about the whole thing. I really begin to believe that my fine-tuned gaydar detected him really well. But hey, I could be wrong and mistaken. who knows. I thought about what I should do next for a moment while working on my legs. Finally, I decided to go to the piano, where he usually go after workout, and talk to him. I was glad I did it. It's a very casual conversation about music, piano, art, nashville, how to break into music business and so on. It's a little bit awkward for a while to just converse with him. Nonetheless, I talked with him, so that's a huge step. His name is David, I'm sure I will meet him later and we can have more chat.   I went out for a walk tonight after nine thirty. It's great to enjoy the quiet night while walking. I did the same thing as last week, that is call parents and sisters. It's the same thing. Not much fun. Mom is still trying to teach us things that we should do while she cannot even do well. Oh, well, that's the typical thing that most people do. I will let it go and just answer yes, right and say good night.   It's another boring saturday. I am thinking about going shopping tomorrow. Need to buy some rice, paper to print Resume and a birthday card to Paul, his birthday is 11/10.

      I watched Pulp Fiction. It wasn't that good. At least the editing isn't doing a great job. And the story could be shorter. I can see that there are some movies like Urbania show some hints of the way they make it. But Urbania and one british film about gay marriage did a much better job in explaining the plot more explicitly. Put everything about the movie asides, the whole idea of poor people make huge hits in hollywood seems shady when people make their trashy lives into movies and consider them as arts. Some can be, but most aren't. At least this director isn't that great in organizing his materials together. If there is a better director, it could be a much better film, although i'm not a big fan of those materials.   The movie worth mention is Basquiat, which captured the life of Jean Mitchell Basquiat, a young graffiti artist in New York. It's real, touchy and artsy at the same time. Definitely a must see for people who are artsy themselves and care about art too.   Then Ethan Frome is another good film. I'm glad I watched it before I decided to return it. Liam Neeson was in it. Very tragic ending. The relationship between one man and two women make them deserted from the people in the village. But the true love and the genuine feelings those people share is so pure and rare in the society filled with corruption and filthy people. Another must see film. I'm surprised that people on IMDB didn't rate it very high.   When I do return the tape, the lady in Nashville library said it was a great film. But she thought it was so tragic and sad. Anyway, isn't that what life is about? The tragedies always bring the shining side of human being out. Bravo to that.  (Sat Sep 20, 01:31:52 AM )

      I had an interview with Mr. Buckmaster from GE Plastics. We talked about the position and what the work will be like if I join the company. He is interviewing more people and building up a research team geared towards to customized plastic design. At the end of the interview, he mentioned that he will send out an email about the signup package and what they could offer. I haven't get the information yet, but I hope it's a good offer and make me to really think hard to decide whethere I should go back or not. We'll see...  I cooked Chicken Noodle Soup tonight. With some fresh parsley, chicken broth, and egg noodle. I made a nice soup dinner. There are more stuff in the soup book. Need more time to experience it.

      Saturday is really boring, I spend the whole day doing nothing. After I watched some videotapes and felt bored about what I was doing, I went out for a walk around 10pm. It was very pleasant outside. Breeze brushed through my face and it felt great.  I brought cellphone with me to talk with parents and family. Dad went home on Sunday morning. Mom and sis was at home. As soon as I told her the news that GE would interview me on Monday for the position openning in Shanghai, sis spend over hald an hour trying to convince me to go back home and work there. It was all reasonable and I was thinking about the same kind of things. However, after spending so long time and get used to all the customs and other stuff, it's really hard to make up my mind to give up everything and go back.  Although deep in my heart I knew I probably will have a much higher start point in my life if I go back, it's still the very hard to consider that as an option in my life.   Sunday is boring too. I went over to the library returned some tapes before I went to library to download more clips. Then I went to jogging for 3 miles. There are some cuties there running on the track. It's fun to watch those guys. :) That's actually one of the biggest thrill go jogging besides the feeling jogging give me--- eyecandy.  I always wanted to jog everyday, but there are always something came up and I just let it go.  Tonight is the 10th anniversary show of Conan O'Brian. He put up a jumbo show in primetime. It's really cool to see the evolvement of the show in the past 10 years. He is not my favorate comic, but he is not the worst. I appreciate his hysterical humor sometimes. Just for that, I hope he can stay on the air longer.

      I went to the dinner with Huawei, Jinwei's friends and we celebrated Moon festival together. It's not as bad as I thought. There are totally eight people and I liked one person. The rest of them are pretty self centered and boring. I talked with the Hu Qian, Jinwei and another girl during the dinner and have some interesting conversations.   Afterwards, I took 3 of them back to school. Two left earlier in the garage and I was in the car with Qian. We kind of have some natural conversation started about everything going on in life and LSAT preparation. She suggest me to go to law school and she really think I will be very good at it since my logic reasoning is great in her eyes. I am very encouraged by her words. But the conversation part about her attitude towards life make me really reconsider what I have thought about my life. I need to try 100 times harder to make life better and I cannot just do what I am doing right now while expecting things will change for good magically. It won't happen. The good things only happen to people who try. I wasn't trying hard enough, and I will start doing that. Thanks to her for this talk and it was very meaningful and in time.

      I got up a little bit earlier than a few days ago and watched some TV. After spending the whole night wait for the DVD encoding function. I figured that there is something wrong with the methods and I have to redo a few steps all over again. At around 12AM this morning, the final version of the Scent of the Women is finished. The quality is awesome. It will take much less time next time when I try to copy another DVD.   I went to lunch with ADAM and other people on his floor and it's a farewell party. He is quite a character in some ways and he helped me some in the past. It's great to see him leave for a better position. But the lunch time is a little bit awkward since four of us are not very familiar with each other. It's very hard to start a conversation considering Eric Barf isn't that enthusiastic about me. Anyhow, it went not bad and I tried harder than before to make the conversation flow. good effort.

      Scent of Women by Al Pacino and Chris O'Donnell  I watched this movie the second time today. I remember the first time is long long time ago when I was a kid in my parents old house. I got more meaning out of the movie now then ever.   A person's true identity is hard to find. An asshole can also be the sweetest man in the world. A odd situation can turn around to be the most beautiful thing ever happened to your life. A person with integrity live a far more meaningful life for him and for everyone else.   I'm making the rip of this video now. It is a great treasure of what I have and it will always be.    " It's a great day for singing a song; and it's a great day for moving along; and it's a great day for morning and night; and it's a great day for everybody's plight.

      Oops, it's not a discussion about the possibility and reality any more. The possibility BECAME a reality, even it's on a TV show. Anyhow, we are both clear about the fact that it's a different issue we are talking about and more importantly care about. So, let it be.    I truely believe  what you said about how hard it is and so forth, because otherwise there wouldn't be so many people who are lonely in all their lives. And it's just because of that hardship, there are people who are willing to put up with all kinds of tests, and there are people who are willing to take the tests at the same time to go to the next steps. That's far more important than whether they can find true love or not.  The process made them grow and mature, and that IS the most beautiful thing eventually.   As for whether the show is fake or not, I couldn't care less. At least it showed a bright side of human being and that's what most reality shows lack of right now.    Happy Mid-Autumn's day to you. Enjoy it with your Mom. Say hi to her.    outbackvandy ----- Original Message -----  From: Qian To: outbackvandy Sent: Wednesday, September 10, 2003 5:04 PM Subject: RE: did you see FLFM2 season finale?   You’re right. I don’t deny there is possibility of true love over money. But sorry I still can’t agree on this point the show proved this possibility. While I would rather this end to be true, I still believe it is more artificial than real. Indeed I regard the show more like a dream of true love appeal to those who are always willing to search for true love than a real thing. The one thing I want to point out is that it is because the true love is hard to find, the show is successful. But still show’s a show, not reality, not natural but made by men.      Ok, maybe next time we can continue our debate J but today, Happy Mid-autumn’s Day.     Qian

       urlLink NBC.com > For Love or Money 2   The final episode of For Love or Money 2 is shown tonight and Erin decided to choose Chad. He played a little trick for a bit and make Erin think think he was gonna to choose money. It was funny to see how Erin relieved after getting the news that he actually chose her over one million dollars. I felt great that there were true love in the world and it CAN happen on television shows. I just find Hu Qian's phone number and call her up to tell her the news. Just to prove she is wrong about the true love will make me feel good. :)  Congratulations to Erin and Chad. You two look great together.

       I found some interesting personal Blog site through the book I read " DYO home page". The  urlLink cockybastard 's site is funny.   He is a person with free thought. A true artist in many ways although his art isn't that great. :)   Ann: How do you deal with the insulting pages?  Halcyon: I'm pretty good at ignoring them. It's like they don't even register.  My boss told me a great story about the Buddha: Someone was yelling insults at the Buddha. When there was a break in the yelling, Buddha asked, "If you bring me a gift, but I do not accept that gift, who then is in possession of that gift?" I try really hard to not accept negativity.

      After spending the afternoon on computer categorizing the files and old stuff, I went food shopping.  I felt so hungry when I got to Kroger and my stocmach was moaning. After I came back, I ate one Yogurt and suddenly felt uncomfort in my stomach. The dinner wasn't tasting good after all that. The whole night is a nightmare while I try to distract myself watching some movies. One is about Beatles called  urlLink "One Hard Day's Night" . It was a fantastic and unique film about the four beatles. It's great to know that four of them are quite good actors themselves.   Then I watched another movie called " urlLink Clerk ", it's a so so movie, talking about how ordinary people find the meaning of their lives.  Not too much fun.   Interestingly, both movies I watched tonight are black and white movies. Quite a coincidence.

      It's still impossible to open the blog page. However, I can post it, so it's a good thing. When the site come back up again, I can import all the old entries into MOVABLETYPE blog on my free server. I would love to see how good it looks like. :)  I went out last night to meet Michael. We went to Chili's for dinner and had a nice conversation. Then we played for a while. It's fun. Just not as fun as I thought it would be. After that, we begin to watch some video that Conductors recorded during the annual RUN. All those show numbers are quite funny. I probably will watch their RUN next year if I can.

      I couldn't believe that I spent another three hour tonight (well, this morning) trying to make the blogger's interface look better. I like the final results nonetheless.  It's simple and artistic.   I went to Steve's new apartment tonight and hang out with him for a while. It's fun and we talked a lot about each other's life and stuff. I'm glad we keep in touch and keep the friendship going.   There were only 5 people left in the Big brother 4 house. After tonight, Jee was eliminated. The left four people are Jun, Erika, Ali and Robert. Three girls against one guy. I thought the three ladies alliance will go to the final three. However, Robert did a great job and get the hold of the HOH. The Head of Household title will guarantee his position in the final three. I'm not a big fan of his. But it's good to see a guy in the finals. :) Good luck, Robert. At the same time, I hope Jun will win. She really deserve it because she is smart, palying game hard, also, because she is asian. I root for minority as always.  Good luck to Jun too.  Whoever win, just don't like Ali win. That bitch doesn't deserve anything. Most of the audience will feel the same way.

        Customer: Well, after much consideration, I've decided to  install Love.  Can you guide me through the process?      Tech Support: Yes I can help you.  Are you ready to proceed?      Customer: Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready.   What do I do first?      Tech Support: The first step is to open your heart.  Have you located your heart Ma'am?      Customer: Yes, but there are several other programs running now.   Is it okay to install Love while they are running?      Tech Support: What programs are running Ma'am?      Customer: Let's see, I have past-hurt, low self-esteem, grudge,   and resentment running right now.      Tech Support: No problem, Love will gradually erase past-hurt from your current operating system.  It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. Love will eventually override low self-esteem with a module of it's own called high self-esteem.  However, you have to completely turn off grudge and resentment.  Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed.  Can you turn those off Ma'am?      Customer: I don't know how to turn them off.  Can you tell me how?      Tech Support: With pleasure.  Go to your start menu and invoke forgiveness.  Do this as many times as necessary until grudge and forgiveness have completely erased.      Customer: Okay done, Love has started installing itself. Is that normal?      Tech Support: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program.  You need to begin connecting to other hearts in order to get the upgrades.      Customer: Oops!  I have an error message already. It says, "error-program not run on external components." What should I do?      Tech Support: Don't worry Ma'am, It means the Love program is set-up to run on internal hearts but has not yet been run on your heart.  In non-technical terms, it means you have to Love yourself before you can Love others.      Customer: So what should I do?      Tech Support: Can you pull down self-acceptance; then click on the following files: Forgive-self; Realize your worth; Acknowledge your limitations.      Customer: OK, done.      Tech Support: Now copy them to the "My Heart" directory. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching faulty programming.  Also, you need to delete verbose self-criticism from all directories and empty your recycle bin to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back.      Customer: Got it.  Hey!!!  My Heart is filling up with new files.  Smile is playing on my monitor and Peace and Contentment are copying themselves all over My Heart.  Is this normal?      Tech Support: Sometimes.  For others it takes a while, but eventually everything gets downloaded at the proper time. So Love is installed and running.  One more thing before we hang-up.  Love is Freeware.  Be sure to give it and it's various modules to everyone you meet. They will in turn share it with others and return some cool modules back to you.      Customer: I promise to do just that. By the way, what's your name?      Tech Support: Just call me the Divine Cardiologist, also known as the Great Physician, or just "I AM."  Most people feel all they need is an annual checkup to stay heart-healthy; but the manufacturer (ME) suggests a daily maintenance schedule for maximum Love efficiency.   KEEP IN TOUCH!

      I went to bed quite late last night tring to scramble some materials together to prepare for the interview this morning with Mr. Massey from Centex. I think I answered his question quite well. His words is not very transparent so that I cannot hear whether he is impressed or not. However, I hope I did impress him and he will give me the job when he come back overseas.   I will write him a thank you email this afternoon.

However, since my experience with HEADER, FOOTER, SIDEBAR function is not good enough to decipher everything completely, I didn't make the webdesign follow the rules very well.

I didn't put much efforts last night when I first apply for the hosting service and get turned down this morning for not following the rules and not complying the application guidelines. The response from some of the guys are pretty negative.   However, I get over that and prepared a detailed application form. The boys are still negative since I only get the title messed up. But they let it go and consider it as a complete application. Hopefully, they will vote me a free website space. By then, I can blog on that site freely and with style. :)

      It's a relaxing Monday. I got up about 10 and went to workout not long after. It's getting a little bit boring now in Yoga classes and I wasn't trying very hard to make every pose perfect. The downward facing dogs are the worst one. Most of my excitement of yoga making my body looking great is gone. However, I'm gonna stick with it until my last day to access the school's gym. Just have something to do.   Steve (Farmer) called me in the afternoon and want to hang out. We went out and got some subs in SUB STOP. Wonderful subs! I just love their chewy bread. Starbucks is followed and nothing special there. He told me that he is doing prostitution thing again. What a lazy ass. :) I'm surprised he doesn't feel any guilt doing that. Anyway, it's his choice and I don't want to judge him by any means.   The trip to pick up Jin and Ting is not bad. They are trying hard to keep the boring conversation and their boring experience in L.A. It's kind of pathetic to see them living the lives in a pathetic way. :( That's pretty much for today.   I did revise the resume for sister, she wasn't trying hard at all. I don't know what to tell her, probably just let it slip away...

      It's been weird since I came back from LA. I don't have interest to watch TV any more. I just want to sit in a peaceful environment and read books. While in LA, I spent a few afternoons reading books in Barnes and Nobles. It's great to find out how wonderful the world is by reading books. Currently I am reading  urlLink One L  by  urlLink Scott Turow . It's an fasinating book to read. I almost make up my mind to go to law school after talking with Steve in LA and this just make the law school life more interesting. Don't get me wrong, it's tough, but it sounds fun and really is up to individual to adjust accordingly. I am so tired of being inefficient and doing something I don't want to do. Although I'm not sure I want to be lawyer yet except the fact that the income is great, I am sure I will like the education in law school. Before going for that, I will start practicing writing and reading skills intensively in order to succeed in law school.   I got up very early this morning and took Lu Jin and Wang Ting to the airport. They will visit LA for about a week for a chemical engineering conference. It felt great to help people out. I'm glad they asked me this time since they never asked me before to take them to the airport while I asked Jin's favor many times. I am kind of feeling guilty about the whole thing. But this morning balanced things out a little bit.

      Just got back to Nashville yesterday with a headache and fever. It's been a trip of fun and suffer. It's fun to hang out with friends and enjoy the new things I never experienced before. It's a suffering since I was basically sick the whole time.   I met Steve in Los Angeles and we began to talk like close friends immediately. He is not the type of ideal guy I would date physically. But I am drawn to him for his warm hearted help and outgoing personality. I want to write down the feeling soon.   What I want to say now is, do I feel so lonely since I get back because of lonely for love or miss him so much with true feelings. I don't know and I want to know. I don't get much correspondence since I got back from Steve. I'm not sure he felt it's too far away for us or we are not good together. I want to be happy and I felt I was happy with him. Hope this will go well. He probably just took off in CA and I want to see him online tonight so that we can chat for a while. It's great to be connected with someone you like and care.

      Jack from NYC called me last night and planned to come to Nashville today. I don't want to blow him off on the phone and also tried to give me a chance to know someone who might be interesting in person although he is awefully full of himself on the phone.   As planned, he arrived Nashville around 12 at noon. I got up not long  before that. It was a good 8 hour sleep although it took me long time to go to sleep due to the strong caffine from Starbucks.   I guided him to Borders bookstore and as he approached me, he looked a lot older than his picture appeared on the website. Anyway, his age and appearance has nothing to do my little intersest in him. All I have agreed before hand is to meet him. I tried to know him better with an open heart.   We headed towards P. F. Chang right afterwards and had lunch together. The cantonese duck is DIVINE, well, at least in the U.S.A. considering I haven't had that for a LONG time. The initial converstation went okay. He then became more full of himself and talked on and on about how successful his career is and how he can get free flight and free hotel stays, plus free prescription drugs from the greatest Pfizer he worked form. I have great respect for his success and his lifestyle. It's just not cool to brag about it for hours. I felt sorry for him.   Another reason I don't like him is he tends to be very aggressive sexually. I mean it's a good thing is he know me well. However, he just met men and started groping all over and feel my muscles. That's so not cool. I got enough of him and just wanted him to leave around 5:30pm. I'm so glad Huawei came back home around 6 and he decided it was time for him to jet. I tried to be very nice with his leave and hoped never see him again. Hope this poor guy could grow up a little bit before he crash his next date. :)

      I wrote something just now and the damn Internet Explorer crashed on me.   I went out with Michael to the demo in Steven and Michael's home. They invited two guys from New York and North Carolina to do the training session. I learned a lot about the techniques and safety issues. It's very enlightening and I enjoyed it a lot. Dave, the guy from KY with a partner who is Japanese, kept hitting on me. It's really weird because he behave like such a slut. I felt bad for his partner. However, it definitely make me feel more confident about myself, which is a good thing. I could never imagine how impartant the image is in the United States. I was checked out in the Starbucks tonight. When I go shopping in Harris Teeter afterwards, the lady cashier checked me out too. I think it's really safe to label it as a lustrous society.  This Sunday is pretty cool. James in Virginia was supposed to be in Nashville meeting me tonight for dinner. But he changed his plan again. I'm disappointed about that. However, I already have the feeling that he was not coming and the shock isn't very huge. That's definitely something I learned from dealing with Americans.   At around 11am this morning, I was woke up by Bev's call. She invited me to her home to join the other people from the church for lunch. It's a pretty sudden invitation. I took my time to take a shower and clean up. When I do show up, they already half way through the sunday lunch. There are about 6 other peoples around the table. Two of them are Beau and Pamela I met last Sunday in the 12th&Porter. Jim is another student in Vanderbilt Law School who went to China a year ago. I'm surprised he knew how to spell my name in Chinese. So cool. We had a very nice lunch. Sarah, a very sincere girl from New Zealand, made a raw tuna salad, Pam prepared a delicious pineapple salad. There are some other Chinese take-out and home-made desserts. Jim and Beau gathered around and we talked about Chinese characters and talked a lot about the experience, education, politics and food in China. It's very informative and exciting.   The conversation afterwards is very cool and relaxing. I'm glad we didn't focus much on the Bible. Most of us are talking about the humors and jokes happened to us and become familiar with each other. It's a very exciting afternoon. I enjoyed the campanions of them.   They also mentioned John Eaves was diagonsed with stomach cancer and probably won't live for long. I pray for him and wish him has a peaceful ending.

      (from Agrainofsand Blog) In the still of the night, you sit in your room alone, pondering. Oblivious, unaware of the fact that many others like you are also sitting quietly in their own corner of their rooms, savouring the peace of the evening, drinking in the comforting weight of the darkness. And the refrains of a song echos through the lonely night...  Angel - Sarah Mclachlan   Spend all my time waiting for that second chance  For the break that will make it ok   There's always some reason to feel not good enough  And it's hard at the end of the day  I need some distraction or a beautiful release   Memories seep from my veins  Let me be empty and weightless and maybe   I'll find some peace tonight   In the arms of the Angel far away from here   From this dark, cold hotel room  And the endlessness that you feel   You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie   You're in the arms of the Angel  May you find some comfort here   So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn   There's vultures and thieves at your back   The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies   That make up for all that you lack   That don't make no difference, escape one last time   It's easier to believe In this sweet madness   Oh this glorious sadness   That brings me to my knees   In the arms of the Angel, far away from here   From this dark, cold hotel room   And the endlessness that you feel   You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie   You're in the arms of the Angel   May you find some comfort here   In the arms of the Angel; may you find some comfort here.  ________________________________  Turn up the corner of your mouths and smile, for there's a light in the darkness. And soon, in a few more hours, the sky will again glow a soft orange, before the sun bursts forth again in its glory, unwounded.

      I got up pretty late again this morning. After cleaned up, I went to Borders and started the three-hour diagnostic LSAT session. It's tough after three years no excercise. However, I'm surprised that I can do well on the argument section well. The reading comprehension secion and logic reasoning is not as good and I don't have enough time to finish those.   I need to start the school application process now too. Need time to think about it.

      Finally, I watched  urlLink "Schindler's List"  . Everytime when you watch a war film, there are always shocking and touching moments. For this super long 3 hour and 12 minutes film, I cried in the last hour many times. When Schindler is ready to flee and the Jewish Rabbi gave him the letter with autographs from all the jews in the factory in case he got caught; When Schindler was mumbling "I could get more (people)"; When the survivors from the war pay him respect at his tomb many years later, many came with their kids, grandkids... Order came back to the world and humanity came back to the world after the chaos war created. I always thought that those kind of cruel things won't happen the the human being again since we are all so civilized. But weren't those people in the war also thought the same? People are essentially good and I am not going to fall into traditional cynical cycle about the world. Schindler's act changed the world, at least the people who he saved and the people who read and watched his brave behaviors. That's what makes the world better.   I basically spent the whole day watching movies. I spent another 4 hours watching  urlLink " " . The relationship game people are playing in the show is hard to guess when you are living the real life and experiencing the same thing. Relationship is never what it seems like. People could see a beautiful picture and hope themselves will be the that lucky and have a beautiful fairy tale life. And deep inside, everybody knows no matter where you are, you just have to deal with all the shit you have to deal with everyday. Any difference? I'm afraid not.  I kept thinking what my life will be if I am with Steve. That will probably just another mess. It's hard to straight things out while my own stuff is not staightened yet. Not to mention he has his own problems with himself and his mom. Oh well, maybe my life is not too bad. Just need to make it better. :)

      It's a halloween night. So great to be invited to the Dave's party. There are so many people who dressed up as fun characters. It's just like in a movie set. Many of them even made the costumes themselves. Definitely the greatest Halloween party ever! :)  Katie and Abbey were there tonight, which relieved my worry that I won't have any one to talk to... Katie was an Egypt Princess and Abbey dressed up as a white trash... After about an hour, people get loosen up either by alchohol or just familiar with each other. Not after long, I am one of the partier and talking to many people in it. Definitely more than I expected.   I"m so glad I dressed up with the help from  urlLink Corinne , Eric(Dave's brother)'s girl friend. It helped a lot to fit in the party. I need to send Corinne the pictures I promised to send her...   I'm kind of tipsy right now and don't know exactly what I am talking about. Anyway, I just blah something down as a memorendum.

      God, this is awesome, I found a free internet to use at home. :)  No need to use dialup again until this dude find it. LOL  I was pretty depressed today for a while. However, I got better after workout. The sweat and other stuff make this depression go away very fast.

      I finished reading the Runaway Jury by John Grisham on Thursday morning. It's an interesting book. Pretty smart, However, very cliche considering most of John Grisham's book are the similar pattern.

      I checked out the website of career center around 2pm on Thursday and sent out a resume to Performance Automation. James McQuade is the president and he called me in the afternoon. We had a short conversation about the job opening and we set up a time slot on Friday, which is today to talk and it's an official interview. According to the job posting, this could evolve into a full time position. I hope this will happen. Cross my fingers.   Also, sister sent me the email with a contact person in Oracle. Maybe she will be able to help me in the job hunting process. Hope so. Wish me the best of luck.

        J.M. Smucker Tops FORTUNE List of 100 Best Companies to Work For; 107-Year-Old Family Controlled Business Moves up from No. 8 on Last Year's List   Alston & Bird Holds No. 2 Spot; Container Store at No. 3   ( urlLink CSRwire ) NEW YORK--J.M. Smucker, the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of jam, jelly and other food items, tops FORTUNE's seventh annual 100 Best Companies to Work For list. The 107-year-old family-controlled company had a total return of 100% over the past five years, and has never had layoffs. Gimmick-free management starts with the co-CEOs, Tim and Richard Smucker, who took the reins in 2001 and adhere to a simple code of conduct established by their father and former CEO, Paul Smucker. "The play-well-with-others approach, as precious as it comes across to an outsider, has clearly won over employees," says FORTUNE writer Julia Boorstin. The list and related stories appear in the January 12, 2004 issue, available on newsstands January 5 and at www.fortune.com today.   "It's been a rough couple of years for jobs. But lots of companies still want to be good places to work--and 59 of the companies on the list actually added to their payrolls last year," write Robert Levering and Milton Moskowitz of the Great Place to Work Institute, which researches and compiles the list. Noteworthy list changes include: Only 16 high-tech companies made this year's list, as opposed to 22 five years ago and there are now seven hospitals, up from two in 1998. In addition, sixteen newcomers made the cut, including the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), highway builder Granite Construction (Watsonville, CA), and mall chain Hot Topic (City of Industry, CA).   Atlanta law firm Alston & Bird, which offers generous maternity leave for mothers (and fathers if they are the primary caregivers) and has an on-site child-care center, is No. 2 on the list. No. 3, Dallas-based Container Store, helps employees reduce stress by offering yoga, monthly chair massages, stretching classes and an online exercise and nutrition diary personalized for every worker. At No. 4 is Edward Jones, the financial services firm based in St. Louis that continues to grow--it added 1,500 employees in the past 12 months--and has not had a layoff in 34 years. Republic Bancorp of Owosso, Michigan, is No. 5. Last year, 300 employees were awarded trips to Aruba, Cancun, and the Dominican Republic, and all employees receive stock options.   Rounding out the top ten are Adobe Systems (No. 6), whose new high-rise in San Jose will include a basketball court; TDIndustries (No. 7), the Dallas company where all employees are allowed 100% reimbursement of tuition, fees, and books at any state-supported college; SAS Institute (No. 8) in Cary, N.C., where employees enjoy three different cafeterias, two Montessori child-care centers, and an on-site fitness center with a ten-lane pool; Rochester-based Wegmans Food Markets (No. 9), which offers zero-premium health insurance to employees making less than $55,000 and where 652 workers have been at the company 25 years or more; and Xilinx (No. 10), the San Jose chipmaker that continued its "no lay-off" policy by requiring management to take a 20% pay cut.   "Overall," conclude Levering and Moskowitz, "today's lesson is that perks are nice, but employees are looking for something more basic. They want to be told the truth, especially if the news is bad. They also want, corny as it sounds, to feel they make a difference and to be given a chance to grow."   To create the list, Levering and Moskowitz surveyed 46,526 randomly selected employees from 304 candidate companies who filled out an employee-opinion survey. Nearly half also gave written comments about their workplaces. Each candidate company also filled out a questionnaire detailing its people policies, practices, and philosophies. Companies were evaluated on both the employee surveys and the company questionnaires, with the employees' opinions being given two-thirds of the total score. "The most important factor in selecting companies for this list is what employees themselves have to say about their workplaces," write Levering and Moskowitz.

       urlLink NPR : Talk of the Nation for Monday, January 5, 2004   I heard this edition of TOTN on NPR. The segment of Career change is very interesting. here is the abstract: " Monday, January 5, 2004 The recent ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Court promises to make gay marriage one of the biggest social issues in the coming 2004 elections. The ruling is the starting point of a new series of conversations on Talk of the Nation about the emerging politics of gay marriage. NPR's Lynn Neary is guest host.   In the second hour of the show: Do you wish your job took you outside more? Do you wish your time in front of the computer contributed to something important to you? Maybe you have a private idea of how you could live better... We talk about finding life satisfaction through job change.  "  Book mentioned in the show above is called  urlLink  "What should I do with my life?"

      I hung out with Dave and Lance (one of Dave's roommates) in Fido tonight. This is the first time I went there. We read some book and talked about some jokes. We had a great time together. Lance even told some really interesting gay jokes that happened to him. :) I should do this more often.

      I intended to put this post this post a little bit early yesterday, well, in this case, last year to talk about some interesting opinion about the term "Happy New Year". It's a rather pessimistic idea about the actual meaning of happy new year to many people.   There are so many people who aren't satisfied with their lives in the past year and want a new start. Saying Happy New Year to each other seems to bring happiness to everyone althought it may not change the luck or whatever you need to change the life around. It's just another way to comfort yourself and other people and say, it's okay, next year, everything will be different and better. Let's have high hope for it and expect every wish you made in the last minute of the year will come true, all the distress and sadness in the past year will be gone, the world will be peaceful for a while after Saddam were captured...  Not everything will change over time, but we have hope, and we hope the new year will truly a happy one. Until then, we can say at the end of the year, I had a happy old year and I will have a happy new year!
