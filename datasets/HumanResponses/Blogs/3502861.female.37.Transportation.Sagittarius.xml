      Many rides,Pick ups, drop offs,Never knowing what you may meet.Feeling fear at times and wondering what your next fare may bring..I had a few close calls that were of a scare but being a woman you need to expect that in this buisness.It is not a easy job as many may think..It consists of many long hours a lot of thinking and stress.. One of my runs the first week I started at this Driving job was a bad ride.I picked up a woman and a child in a decent subdivision on the corner of 2 streets the child had no shoes on and they were in my car.The woman seemed to be a little nervous she wanted to go pick up money stop at a friends and than be driven back to the spot that she was picked up at.It ended up being a run around ride meter running could not find the one with the money so we drove to a large old house which was located in a bad area.I waited in front of this old house for over a half hour seemed like there was something wrong.People coming in and out of the house a lot of cars pulling in and out.Well a person came out to say the woman had left out the back door.I called the company and they called the police so I had to wait out in front where drugs were being done and bought.I felt a little scared.They sent my coworker over to wait with me which was over an hour wait.Well the police arrived and did go to the house and the lady and child did come outthe lady ended up arrested with drug charges in the past and this was a drug house also no fare paid and a lot of wasted time.Alot of chances taken in this job..

      Airport time at that lot could be interesting at times.I met one guy who was a Taxi Driver who was nice and we talked many hours..My plane was late that day by a few hours so I decided to walk a little and than I seen this Driver approaching me and he was a good looking and friendly person.We sat in his Taxi and had a great conservations was one of the normal guys I ran across and I enjoyed our nice talk.. The lot was moved to another place which was smaller and harder to park was so different adjusted to it in time longer to get to your arrival. At the other lot I had a few admirers who would love to chat and hang out.I enjoyed the chats but anything more I was not interested in more than talk.One Driver always wanted to take me to Jamaica he was nice but became a little pushy..The whole set up of these waiting lots were not a real well place with much space..I adapted to being a Lady Driver and dealing with the Taxi life of the good and bad...You need a strong sense of mind and patience waits in the lots sometimes fun and other times just being there..That is some of Airport Life..

      WEll from the years of 2000-2003 There was many Airport runs I did some were fun others were a distress spent at those 2 main Airports O'Hare and Midway.Sometimes it felt like my second home.Many faces new and old.Always waiting for that favorite face to see which was my friend from years.There were many times I would drive up the road to the local McDonald grab a ice tea as the plane had me wait those extra minutes sometimes hours..In that cab lot I would park on the side in the front.Sometimes take that walk anything to kill the wait and boredom. I would have many chats with many of the drivers there,Some nice and some would get a little Extra wanting to get together in many ways..I was one of the girls there which were not too many.Maybe one or two..Always friendly to all..The drive without traffic was 45 minutes to O'Hare,we would try to arrive at least a half hour before set time of arrival call to check on that arrival and head to that lot or wherever we would like to wait...Get there fill out that ticket and attatch that sticker that was tax on the pick up..Listening to a lot of music and a lot of driving to get through the long days.. O'Hare lot always had more happening guys would work out at times in the lot others would be sleeping or visiting that little snack truck..The lot was almost always full to the max which it was not a real large area..Many different companies with many different feelings shown on their face..Always another day ....Continued Next Post..

      I started a job with a small Taxi Cab Company May 2000. It was a new position to me and I thought to myself why not give it a try. It was a small Company which consisted of 5 cars which were new and different than a regular Taxi. My first day of driving was interesting drove a dark green Lumina car it was nice.The fare was $1.80 per mile.We are paid 30% of all fares and tips are ours.   The Company had set fares for regular customers.To O'Hare Airport the set fare was $40 and $5 each additional person.To Midway Airport it was $35.  I started work on the shift at 7:30 am till around 4:00 -5:00 pm ,It varied day by day by the runs I was given.Alot of the runs were already prearranged,some were call ins.  The first day was fun and different.I enjoyed it and it was not as hard as I thought it would be.I enjoyed talking to the customers and  meeting new people.The first days money was not the best and the tips were low.I was disappointed in the amount of money I did make.  The office was out of the lady that owned the Company's house.It was a comfortable place and Bob was in charge of the runs we did he was like a boss he also drove and the owner did at times.We would either go do errands or go back to the house in between our runs..The airports were the better money to be made and our gas was covered through the company.The pick ups from the airport had a $2 tax sticker in which we needed to do a arranged pick up and the Company did cover that also. We had a suburban taxi waiting lot till the arrival came in.It was boring at times.I would read and talk on the cell phone as I waited.I would have a conversation with other drivers and limo drivers.The time would go faster,sometimes the planes could be 1-3 hours late and time was spent there.Could be interesting  at times.

      Fill the car with gas so it can be drove far. Clean the windows to see clear when your on a dark road nowhere near. Start up the car get ready we are going far. Drive the road ahead with awareness not carelessness. Stress inside can become wide.Put it all beside.You need to do that long ride..Drive to strive..

Waiting on a call,parked at the mall.Many miles all take a while. Many hours to each day and a lot to say. Tired eyes half way closed,needed rest another day at my best...

      Car full of gas,driving fast.Another run to be done.Fare to be collected always trying to be selected..  Days and nights many hours the tiredness towers.  Many places with a lot of different faces. Doing a lot of miles  sure takes a while.Sometimes hard to smile.   Feeling stress but always doing my best.   Many talks ,a lot said,all stored in my head..  Chances always being taken always leading to a awaken.   Finished night,next day will be alright........

      A Taxi Driver Has Many ways about their self.Alot of people judge this career choice in many ways.Noone ever looks deeper into this situation.A Taxi Driver has more than a lot of people can see.In my time I ran across some of the most interesting people to be a Taxi Driver..Their minds grow with knowledge and gain a lot of creativity..The mind becomes like a mental map the memory grows strong..Research states that many Taxi Drivers are some of the most wise people in IQ tests..This is one of the most dangerous jobs that you can have.It consist of using the mind at all times the memory the mental image.Alot of stress is involved on a everyday situation.The creativity is built upon all of these aspects to create a new look into this career..Never judge a mind that is a special kind that can unwind into the most interesting creative way..People tend to know more doing this job to move further in the future and create a career of their own with all they have learned from what they did in this career to make a better day in many new ways..This of a driver has to have patience,personality,knowledge,and memory all together this creates a high quality in creativity..

      On 9/11/2001 I had a run early morning to O'Hare Airport as I arrived back went into the office and My co-worker said a plane crashed into the towers in New York.The manager did not believe it so he turned on the radio and was listening as we listened we heard the next plane crash into the 2nd tower..All Airports were closed so I and my coworker were sent back to O'Hare to pick up the people that were dropped off in the morning..We sat at Oasis intill we were called to pick up people from earlier.It was such a still feeling the sky clear no planes in sight and so quiet it was kinda of a scared feeling it was such a hard to belive situation I was stunned and tried to take it to my mind..I was alone at Oasis called family and friends to chat and see how they were..Well about in 1 1/2 hours I finally had the call to pick up and the people told me how the plane/Airport would not tell any details of all the happenings all TV's radios were turned off..So we listened to the radio on the way from the airport..Heard all about the 3 now planes that were hijacked and crashed into towers and washington ...Was so odd and scared I even felt funny to work..I even had customers who had tears in their eyes,and crying..Business became slow for the rest of the day,was a weird day felt uneasy...Was a day you wanted to just stay at home because of the feeling in the air..I just could not belive what I heard...What a Day in history Always to remember..9/11/2001...

      Well the smaller Airport was Midway,I really never enjoyed time there.It was a small lot with all Taxis ,limos together and Chicago Cabs also..A lot of people would come through and sell jewelry,and other items..There was a lady who would always walk through and ask for money and knock on the windows she came in her pajamas..She was a little odd but harmless...Just irritating at times.I did feel sorry for her..The Chicago Cab drivers would lay out a mat and kneel to the sun and pray some type of religion..I would not be able to walk not much room there...Sometimes my co workers would be there and we would talk and hang out which was more interesting,I did not know many there as I did at O'Hare which I enjoyed better due to knowing a lot of Drivers and of course my favorite one,Which was the one I knew before working here..Always looked forward to seeing if he would be there..Sometimes I would go hang out at the park down the way or go to the 7-11 and get a few scratch offs or a slurpee..I would read at times or grab a fast bite to eat while I would wait..The longest waits were for ATA it was a nightmare I dreaded those flights..Over a hour at times to collect their luggage..The security was bad also there always yelling and checking every little thing..I once had a stuck window and could not get it up so a Limo Driver fixed it for me and he became interested in me and was asking me on dates and gave me his phone number wanted to date he said him and his family and hisself owned that company,He was saying that he would have people make Love in his Limo a lot..He was a liar and kinda pushy..I never called him but did bump into him a few times He would just get into my cab and sit there..I started to avoid him..That was Midway not all that fun and when traffic had another long route which was long and not fun.....

      Always a different face or place.Some nice,some fun,some bad,some nuts...Crazy rides,crazy days all part of this job you never know what you are going to get..  There was a man who would always like to be picked up behind a library because he had a bad gambling problem and he did not want his wife knowing of his visits to the boat to go gambling.He was sure a character as I drove him to the boat he would talk of how popular he was with all the high gamblers and how he owed a lot of money to everyone and how he was such a great man and he told how he had fought his daughters ex and how he was above all.He was funny and a little gone.He was filled with a lot of odd talk..   Problems were always a big thing people enjoyed to share talk about some were so interesting others crazy..   There was an elderly lady who smoked a lot and had several health issues and could rarely talk anymore..She would want to be taken to buy cigarettes every week which was the whole problem of her health issues.She would tell of her family problems and how she did not get along with the daughter and how she could not wait to be gone.Was some odd stories but she enjoyed to share them.   There was a nice woman I had regular and she had several problems she would share also a great tipper was always between $50-$100 as a tip alone she enjoyed our talks.I would take her to a few stores or to the Airport.We even had lunch together once as we waited on a plane for her son to arrive.She told me her whole life,her husband traveled a lot and he was real abusive where she had heart problems.She was a nice older woman who enjoyed to dress up and take well care of herself she was a sad hurt woman but I related to her real well and gave a lot of advice to her.

      I remember one day the Cab Company received a call from a lady that she was moving from one hotel to the next across the street from one another so we set a price and I went to get her.Well to my surprise she had so many items it was like a apartment filled.I had no idea how all these items would fit in the Taxi.She had a lot of bags filled of items,lamps,ripped bags.It was a shock and the owner and janitors helped out on the move.I felt like a moving Company..Eventually we moved it all across to the other hotel..  There was a regular we would drive to court every so often,A nice but odd woman she had a broken back and she would talk about her violent seizures and that is how she broke her back and she never knew when it would happen again always wondered if that would happen while in the Taxi..One day as I drove her home we returned to her home and she had no key to her house so she asked me if I would go through her window and open her door.She could not due to her broken back..Usually we would not do that but I was nice about it and here I was climbing in a small kitchen window.A different experience ..   One day on the way to the airport I was taking 2 people to drop off for a flight and the traffic was so heavy we felt like we would never get there.Well the man in the back asked for my coffee cup .I said it still has coffee in there when I am done I will give it to him to my knowledge he was planning to use the bathroom in it.I was shocked and tried to rush to the airport for this man..What a way to start a early day..

      When you Drive a Taxi You will Get the good and bad it is always that 50/50 chance you take.One day we received a call it was noon and a guy needed to be picked up at one court house and be dropped off at another which was like a 15 mile run.Well I went to go pick up the guy at the court house and he was a younger male and he got in and off we went.Well as we headed to the other court house the guy started acting oddly and I started to become uncomfortable the guy started talking real strange about dinosaurs under the house.Than he said he had to cut my tounge out if I did not go home and fix my kids dinner.I found that scary.than he wanted to get in the front and kiss.I told him no.Then he took his socks off and threw them out of the window.I pulled to side of road by the University and told the guy I had to use the bathroom.So I told security of the situation and went into the bathroom called into the cab company and the guy started to bang on the door.The Company told me to call the police.I did and waited..Well the owner and her husband showed up and the police.The guy started to kiss the cops and do jumping jacks..They called in a social worker.The owners husband stuck up for me and wanted to fight the guy..The police tried to get the cab fare back the owner said,no..It was a scary ride and they said he was shizo..What a day that was

      One of the worse parts of this job was that traffic.The early mornings and the evening traffic were the bad times of the day to have an airport ride to or from the airports..When the weather was bad the traffic became longer and heavy..I do recall a time that a usual from airport ride took me 30 minutes on a snowy day it ended up being 3 hours and was one of my worse drives..There were those holiday traffic days ,accident days and weather days which many hours were spent on the road.Many miles and so much stress in the wait sometimes you would arrive late.One day while in traffic A song came on and it was Cruisin By Paltro And Huey Lewis from the movie Duets.The words the beat brought the mind to ease to release some of the stress from that heavy traffic.That song became a relaxing tune for me during the traffic and I tried to use it as much as possible.I had some days where the traffic caused people to miss planes,eagerly needing to use the washroom,stiffed up in a car..You always need to be aware of the road ahead,you will see real bad crashes and some of the most stress you will have.Driving is dangerous and on a daily basis it holds more risk..Time is everything in this business and traffic can take that time fast and cause delays.There are times your car will break down but the worse is during that traffic hour.Which has happened to me once and it is not too fun..

      When you drive a Taxi you learn a lot about many people and you meet many different kinds.I drove a Taxi for over 3 years and I had my share of many types of people.You can build a lasting friendship.I would take a woman on a weekly basis to the store near her home and she would buy the same thing every week.She was a nice old woman who grew on me and we became friends.She would buy me gifts on Holidays and take me out to lunch.She became real fond of me and just enjoyed my company..Every week she would put together a little gift bag for me.Soon enough I started to go to the store for her and drop off her items..She still stays in touch with me.   You also get your customers who ask you a lot of advice and enjoy to share their life story with you.They confine in you with their deepest secrets.Some are one time customers others are regulars.The stories vary from health issues,marriage,relationship,family,deepest secrets.You hear a lot of different interesting stories day by day..  Another type of customer you may come across are the obnoxious ones.Ones who are drunk or decide to light up some pot to smoke or the ones who speak vulgar or sexual..   You also get the ones who want to get together and go on a date that are fond of you and really like you.You see many peoples faces and you go many places...
