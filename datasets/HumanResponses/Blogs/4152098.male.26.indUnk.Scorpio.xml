      No not the ones on four wheels, even though there are a lot of those. Drivers for computer hardware. Had to setup a wireless network for one of my Aunties. One look at the equipment and alarms started to go off. Linksys router.......and D-Link wireless card (-.-);; I've had plenty of experience with Linksys routers so no problems there. The D-Link DWL-G510 though, started to give me chills.  Install went smoothly enough. Drivers installed perfectly fine, WinXP and Zone Alarm said they picked up a new network, I was even able to get on the 'net. Then I thought I'd reboot to make sure everything was dandy.........  BAM, S.O.B. couldn't pick up the router. Tried to adjust settings on the wireless configuration tool from D-Link, P.O.S., then some settings on the router.....nothing. So I uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled them, started picking up the router again....I already knew where this was going. Reboot, GONE.  So then next logoical step was GOOGLE. Thank goodness for google. Found a forum post on Broadbandreports.com, suggested installing drivers from ASUS's wireless card (apparently they share the same wireless chipset), worked like a charm. In closing......  DIE D-LINK DIE

      Sell you stupid Barbarian Sword..............  Oh, hey there. Gotta sell off all my FFXI equipment, so that I can hook up all my LinkShell homies with some Gil. Hopefully everyone will get about 20k's worth.  THEN I CAN CANCEL THE DAMN ACCOUNT AND BE FREE.

      I don't know what it is these past few months, I can't get a good night sleep (-.-).......sigh. Must be the damn heat. I just toss and turn 'til the sun comes up. I can't take it anymore, bring on Winter already.....ARGH!!!!!!!!!!  I've been drinking those large cold silky smooth Starbucks Frappuccino in a bottle to stay awake at work. I love my job, but man without that creamy mocha juice, I can't make it thru the day.  I DON'T EVEN LIKE COFFEE FOR GOD'S SAKE.  p.s. I guess staying up 'til 1-2am in the past 9 months didn't help either.  DAMN YOU FINAL FANTASY XI, I QUIT.

      Tired of not getting told straight up if a game sucks? Tired of the game magazines that say they aren't influenced by game publishers, yet half of their magazines are filled ads? Tired of celebraties jumping on the video game bandwagon when they know as much about games, as Jessica Simpson knows about tuna?  Well my fellow gaming buds, you've come to the right place!  LET THE RANTING BEGIN!
