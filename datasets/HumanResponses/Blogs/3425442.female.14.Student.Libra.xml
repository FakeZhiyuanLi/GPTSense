      hm...One thing is that I have dreams and they always come true sooner or later ...well I had this dream with a guy I really like as you might guess Gohan from my last post and I dunno weather it'll come true or not but it seem like it's starting to come true....but yeah. I came out in my friends quincenera thingy and my partner supposebly likes me. My friend told a white lie. Well this is what she told of how it went. She saw him a couple of weeks ago like last last week ^^ and she said " oh you know how ya been and do you miss your partner" and he said " why! Did she say something" and my friend said that just to see what he would say she said " Well she's been asking about you and she does kinda miss you" and he said " I didn't want to say anything but I do miss her" and she was suprised ^_^; >. . hehehe Bye ^_^ I'll come back with more news of my life...^^

      Hm..* gasp* its a long story but basically whats going on right now is my romance life...Lots of things happen. 3 yrs ago I was in 6th grade and by that you would guess I'm in 9th grade now and YAY your right ^_^ hehe but there was this guy  that seemed to noticed me around school I didn't know who he was untill I found out he's my neighbor. ^_^ kinda slow of me but still ^^; hehe now in 7th grade I actually got to talk to him since we had a class together and our last names were almost the same we sat close by. But anyway we got to know each other a bit better ^_^ he was a pretty cool guy and he was in love with my friend. He really liked her but whenever she would try to go up to him with his friends near by he would run away. ^^; it was funny tho. But one day I was comming from school and since...be back g2g somehwere really quick. alrighty I'm back ..hehehe sorry oh and since my house was in front of the school I would just cross over and go home but one time I was crossing over my nieghbor and his friend which is nickname is Gohan ^^ and my nieghbors name is Wolfy...they wouold go all the way around and take the sidewalk were the lady with the orange vest would tell you to stop and go but any way he lives to the left of me meaning he was was walking towards my way..and I was getting down from the hill thingy ^^ and then I here my name being called out it was Gohan ^^ and so I turned to see what they wanted and hen they each point at each other and say he likes you. I was just suprised I mean who wouldn't be ^^ and so I was so nervous and shy back then that I juist smiled and walked into my house...I didn't know what to do. Later I kinda got the impression that they liked me. He would be home before I was and by he I mean Goten ^^  Goten would be home already and I would be walking home everyday and he would play this song and sing it and he would just look at me and smile ^^ I'm a cheerful happy girl so I would smile too but he would play that song by simple plan " addicted" and "I'll do anything" ^^ I laer started liking Gohan every since that one time comming home from school made me think about if it was true or not.Now I'm in the 9th grade and still have that crush and I'm not as shy anymore Yeah I mean I have had other little crushes but I keep getting back to Gohan. I try not to think about him as much coz he has a gf and I dun't want to screw things up for him but he's always saying that he and his gf are having problems and it's hard to please  her and when he does it's not him. I hardly talked to him but now through my friend I see him now and then but I still...*gasp* I'm using this as a way to let out my feeligs inside. I finally revealed my crush to one of my friends since I needed to talk to someone about it...she's helping me figure out things..She also thinks that he still likes me coz he's always looking at me and smiles everytime he sees me and things that you can notice. but I guess that most of my story but I'll post up later whats been going on latley...Untill then  BYE ^_^

      Hiya ^_^ YAY! I made my bloggy thingy ^^ yesh! *jumps up and down* hehehe I'll probably change the layout but for now I'll keep it ^^  "It's better to let go of a memory than to hang on to a burden past."   Hello!  Actually, the site you've just stumbled upon is my personal/blog site. It contains a lot of my personal information... but nothing that can help you identify me in the crowd (hehe...). It also contain entries of endless rant about my boring life. If you haven't been scared away yet... you're brave. If you are searching desperately for a way to escape from this site, just stay put for a moment and surf around. Who knows, you might find something interesting among all this boringness.  Little bit about this site - this is a personal/blog/collective site, which ever name you'd like to call it. Here you can find a little information about me .  Something to kill time while you're visiting this site. So enjoy! And I'd love to hear any feedback from you.   Bye
