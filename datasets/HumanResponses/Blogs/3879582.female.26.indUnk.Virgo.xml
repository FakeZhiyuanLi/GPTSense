       archilles, his father was a mortal, and his mother was a goddess who dipped him in the River Styx to make him invulnerable, except for that bit of his heel where she held him    he grew to become the greatest Greek warrior, and was destined to fight a battle still celebrated today, even though it never happened &nbsp;     Archilles's death    Achilles himself was not destined to a long life. Having by chance seen Polyxena, daughter of King Priam, perhaps on occasion of the truce which was allowed the Trojans for the burial of Hector, he was captivated with her charms; and to win her in marriage, it is said (but not by Homer) that he agreed to influence the Greeks to make peace with Troy. While the hero was in the temple of Apollo negotiating the marriage, Paris discharged at him a poisoned arrow, which, guided by Apollo, fatally wounded him in the heel. This was his only vulnerable spot; for Thetis, having dipped him when an infant in the river Styx, had rendered every part of him invulnerable except that by which she held him.&nbsp;    The body of Achilles so treacherously slain was rescued by Ajax and Ulysses. Thetis directed the Greeks to bestow her son's armor on that hero who of all survivors should be judged most deserving of it. Ajax and Ulysses were the only claimants. A select number of the other chiefs were appointed to award the prize. By the will of Minerva it was awarded to Ulysses, -- wisdom being thus rated above valor. Ajax, enraged, set forth from his tent to wreak vengeance upon the Atridae and Ulysses. But the goddess robbed him of reason and turned his hand against the flocks and herds of the Argives, which he slaughtered or led captive to his tent, counting them the rivals who had wronged him. then the cruel goddess restored to him his wits. And he, fixing his sword in the ground, prepared to take his own life     &nbsp;         &nbsp;

         differences will determined experiences learning about our ownselves better, the way we've never imagining. people reacts based on their instinct defined through years of living. surrounding is our reflection towards life and behaviour.   when first to start with the task, bear in mind the achievement accomplished along with it. success has a powerful reason to change peoples' actions. it is easy to fall within the superiority feeling. it is hard to resist, probably the hardest so far.
