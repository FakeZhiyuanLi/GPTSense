      I've spent the past week trying to find a way to get back up to Illinois. There have been so many setbacks ranging from no money to having a warrant out in IL and to top everything off I was dismissed from NCC because of my grades last term.   I need to find a way to get up there but I can't find anyone to come with me because they would just have to fly back when they got there. I found another way, and in a sense it's the perfect solution but there's no way that anyone would agree to it. If only he wanted to work on things this really would be the perfect plan. I found a train that leaves Naperville on Wednesday and gets to SA on Thursday. We could leave on Friday and drive up to Naperville by Saturday night. Unfortunately that would never happen. It would require him to take more time away from the things he wants to do and then he would have to spend that entire time with me. Granted that would be a great way to start a recovery of our relationship but he's not ready for that.   Last night he told me that he can't see our situation ever changing and that it made him uncomfortable when I told him about my feelings toward him both physical and emotional. He's still shutting me out of that part of his life but I guess that's normal. After the time I was with Jeremy I felt really uncomfortable with Will's affection. It took a long time before I could accept Will fully back into my heart when I had someone else in his place there before. It took time but it did happen. It took a while to even feel right when I was in bed with him. I think that's why I ended up doing what I did with Craig. I was looking for something I thought I had with Jeremy but through that I found out that I had it all along with Will. I was just blocking myself from experiencing it because I hadn't let go of my thoughts of Jeremy. When I did, I found that Will was the man I've always wanted to spend my life with. It had always been the case but if I had kept myself from giving myself to him completely I may have never come to that conclusion. Hopefully Will will be able to open his heart to me again and let go of his feelings he felt toward this other person. Until that happens and until he's willing to give us another try, I can't expect him to be able to handle the things that I want most.

      These past few days have been the hardest of my life. Even breathing is hard. I haven't heard from anyone in IL since Saturday. I've been told that Will has been sick (food poisoning) and today I finally heard that he is just starting to feel better. I've been worried sick that something had happened to him especially since I threatened to tell her parents and the park district that their relationship had continued. I was relieved for a moment and then I remembered that throughout this month he had continued to keep in contact with her, talking for at least an hour a day. He told me that he couldn't control when she called him but I finally looked at the phone records and it shows both him calling her and her calling him. I told him he could always reject the calls. I guess that's what he's done to me now. He won't even talk to me and he's put a block on the cingular site so that I can't see if he's still been calling her which I think is pretty likely. I just wanted to scare him a little into realizing what could happen if this all got out.  I hate being down here. All I hear is that I should stay here and forget about him. That I don't need someone who is treating me the way he is but I can't help it. It would be so much easier if I didn't love him but he really is the love of life. I get so upset when I get upset because he hasn't called because then I do start thinking about calling her parents and I really don't want to do that. I finally sent the e-mail and phone records to his dad because he still doesn't believe that his son would do any of this. I wish I could talk to him but his dad said I was harrassing him so I told his mom that I wouldn't call until he called me, which will probably be never. I had a good talk with a friend of his on Saturday. I'm thinking about calling him again. These days are endless. I can't sleep. I feel sick if I try to eat. Where is my friend when I need him most?

      I dreamt last night that I drove up to Illinois on my own. I found Will and he cried. He told me that he loved me now more than ever and then we made love.  It's too bad that dreams never become reality. I can't even really expect him to call me ever again, falling in love with me again is just about impossible.

      Thursdays are hard enough as it is but I think I may have completely ruined things beyond repair last night. It was supposed to be a nice conversation but I couldn't hold in my unhappiness anymore so I broke down and told him how I felt. I was overpowered by feelings of pain that I said things I shouldn't have. I feel horrible right now. He gets to keep everything that he enjoys and I got left with nothing. I want this day to be over. I doubt he'll ever want to call me back. I feel like I'm losing my mind down here.

      This was an emotionally draining day. I really have nothing left. Will couldn't help falling out of love with me. I can't blame him for that. I'm just not the one for him. I should have known and done more when there was still hope. I guess I just don't understand how someone could marry someone that they aren't in love with. What is love anyway? It's just a stupid feeling that only causes pain in the end. Is it even worth having or giving away? Sometimes it just takes too much work to sustain and people aren't willing or able to go through that. Right now I feel like my feelings are beyond repair. It's best just to throw them away and live life without them. There would be no joy but I think that losing the suffering would make it worth it.

      Up until today I was holding things pretty much together. Sure there were the occasional break downs but I figured that was pretty normal. Today I feel just horrible. I feel like there's nothing left in me. My heart has been shredded and today is the first day that I've actually felt as though it's never going to end. I tried to put a happy face on while talking to some wedding guests that I bumped into. They kept bringing up the wedding and it took everything to keep from tearing up. Today was the first time that I've been tempted to report him and ruin him but I know I could never do that to him. Instead I just cried over my weakness for not being able to be strong anymore. I'd be happy just being his sex buddy in order to relieve any of his physical needs being that I can't satisfy his emotional ones. I've tried to put on a front that I would be fine living without him but the truth is I'm not fine at all. When I gave myself to him, I trusted him with every part of me inside and out and he's destroyed all that I am. I don't know how much longer I'm going to last like this. I really believed him when he told me he wanted to be with me forever. I didn't realize forever was so short. I just want to be saved from all of this but I know there's no one who would even bother to try.

      These next three days are going to be really tough on me. I'm trying to remain distracted. I was able to get out of going to Fredericksburg today so I get to spend the day with some quiet time. I told him why I couldn't sleep last night. I know he doesn't like hearing me in pain. I try my hardest not to let it show. I just wanted to tell him that I wished he was here. My hopes are diminishing. Why did everything have to go so wrong? Why didn't his love for me last?

      It's 2 a.m. and I can't sleep. It occurred to me that I don't really understand what it is that he was saying about my writing. I then started thinking of how I would give him a kiss goodnight every night when he fell asleep on the sofa in the family room. He always had sweat on is forehead and I could remember the feel of it as I kissed him and said "goodnight honey". I really miss that feeling. Then my thoughts turn to the next three days and I wonder if I were to start fencing up there where I would go because I couldn't go to any of his clubs and I could never go to a tournament both because I would be afraid to see her there. I don't think I could handle seeing her again. I can't believe how much hatred fills my heart when I think of her even though I know it's not all her fault and I know she's not the cause of our separation. I don't think I've ever hated someone this much. I really do wish she'd disappear out of both of our lives. They both knew he is married but I guess that doesn't mean anything these days. I truly do hate every aspect of my life right now. I'm sure it will get better but right now I feel like I'm just being left out for the dogs. I don't want to be here and I can't afford to be anywhere else. Once again I'm stuck in a 10 by 11 room with no idea when or where I'll be able to move. The only difference from how things were before (at least from my point) is that I don't have him around to shine any light on the situation. Oh well, I'm supposed to be happy with what I have and I guess I have things to be happy about although none are helping me out tonight. I think this is the lowest I've ever felt in my life. I have to work on rebuilding myself so that I don't feel this way for long. I feel like such a failure. Both my school and home life are in shambles. I hate myself for being so simple and feeling this way. All of the things that were important to me are out of reach, at least for now. My goals are shot. I'm just feeling so alone and I could really use a hug right now. I keep thinking I should have gone with him more to the gym, to the tournaments. I always liked going to the tournaments and I was really looking forward to going to Dave's tournament but I was told I wouldn't have found it fun. Now, every time I see her name on the webpage where she finished in it I think I should have been there. I wish I knew how that all started. When did he decide to act on his feelings? Who made the first move? Why did he have to hurt me so badly? Why do I still love him? When did he stop loving me? What could I have done to have kept this all from happening? He says he still cares for me but how could he have done this unless he really hated me? I would only wish this on my greatest enemy. Even now, I just try to make sure he's happy. Even though I don't want to make him miserable I just wish he knew just how miserable my life has become because of the things he's putting me through. I've been left with nothing, not even my cat, and left in the world to fend for myself. At least he's rid of me and doesn't have to deal with my stupid issues anymore. I just don't understand why he changed his mind about working things out so quickly. His parents say it's because I took off to the hotel that night. I only did that because he yelled at me and told me I wasn't giving him his space. I thought he would appreciate that. Was it that stupid book he read? The problem is, neither of us are seeing things the way the other is so why not get someone to help us do that. I really can't stand being like this.

      Today went alright I guess. I saw that lady this morning which really messed me up for a while. I took a long nap and then waited and waited to get the call to go to the movies with my brother. The basketball game had been forgotten about and of course that was more important than a movie. Talked to Will. It was nice. He read the blog. The only thing he really brought up about it was the end of conversation parts. I told him I understood that he didn't feel comfortable telling anyone that. I guess I should be glad that he isn't telling someone else that but I guess it was still a little upsetting mainly because I wanted to tell it to him and feel like I can't. I'm supposed to go eat with my mom tonight and I guess we're going to Fredericksburg tomorrow. I don't know why. I think she just wants to get me out of the house. Right now I'd just be happy with a little privacy of my own or at least the option of doing things alone. I keep getting stuck staying with the kids. I shouldn't be surprised. It happens every time I come down here. I'm told I can leave them here by themselves but I don't feel comfortable doing that so that's why I always end up doing that. Hopefully I can scrounge up enough money to take some lessons down here. I really need the exercise and it would be nice meeting new people. The only thing is I'm afraid it won't be much of a distraction and I really need something to keep my mind off of things the next three days for obvious reasons. There's really nothing else I can do. Hopefully one of these days will be free of misery but I don't see that happening any time soon. On a bright note, I think I may have found a place to live. It isn't available until the beginning of July so I'm really excited about this possibility.

      I just saw the therapist down here for the first time. She told me that it was clear to her that things are over and that the reason I still love him is because I have low self esteem. She said that if I thought highly of myself I wouldn't let myself be hurt by the things I hear. She said that I would never get over the fact that he had feelings for this person and that I would never be able to trust him again ever. I don't know how I feel about this. I'm battling myself over trying to let go. Part of me is telling me that she's right and I should let go but the other part, the stronger part is telling me not to. I don't think he realizes just how hurt I am by this but I'm not sure if that even matters. I really do want the best for him but deep down I still want that to be with me. I always thought that after seeing a therapist you were supposed to feel better about things. Right now I'm having an overwhelming feeling of panic. My heart is beating so hard and it feels like it's at it's limit. I'm sure she has some misgivings about him right now because I know my mom has spoken to her. I don't know how to clear the picture when it is blurry to even to myself. I just want a chance to prove people wrong. I just get the feeling sometimes when he does call that he's holding back from telling me something. I get the feeling that he doesn't want to hurt me by telling me. Once again this could all be in my mind.

      I miss my husband more than I can express. Lately, I've been afraid to have him call because things seem to be going so well for him. He has his training, work, bike, and tai chi to keep him busy. I try to do things but I always think "Oh, this would be so much fun to do with him". I'm afraid since he seems to be having an easier time with this than I am he is going to just call me up or send me an e-mail telling me that I shouldn't waste my time hoping anything will ever happen between us again. I dread hearing him tell me that he really doesn't love me and that will never change so he wants this separation to be permanent.  I don't meant to make it sound like all I do is pine for him and my days are spent sobbing. I'm okay during most of the day. These thoughts just go through my mind throughout the day at different points and I just really need a method to vent them.  In fact, I've decided to drop my summer courses and withdraw from school for at least a term while I figure things out. This has lifted a lot of stress from me so right now I feel pretty good in that respect. I can't say that I'm happy right now. I don't see how I really could be. I don't believe in divorce. My parents are divorced but in my mind they will always be married. I personally don't think this separation is helping me. It's what he needed and wanted so that's why I went along with it. I had to pick up my car anyway so I thought I'd give him his time and try to stay here as long as I can. I don't know when I'll go back. It would be difficult to go back if he doesn't want me to. I don't want to go through with my packing up there.  All this is coming purely from emotions. My head is so confused right now. I can't see a direction to go in that I want to travel. There are blockades on every road I want to take. All of this is probably in my imagination. It's just that the last time I told myself that it had to be the case it wasn't. That was the most hurt I've ever felt and still feel. Anyway, now that this is out of my system I'll be able to continue my day with some sort of normality.

      I was so excited today because I drove on the highway for the first time. I drove to a fencing school to check it out. I called him to tell him how excited I was and he just said "good for you" and told me he'd call me back when he wasn't going 25 miles an hour. I'm guessing he was riding his bike because there was a lot of wind but then again he drives with his windows down so I don't really know. It's dark now and he hasn't called me back. :( I really want to tell him about this blog but I think it may make me less likely to write how I really felt if I knew he was reading this.

      I called him this afternoon to let him know that there was cycling on television. He was getting ready to go on a training ride and didn't seem to be in much of a mood to talk. This made me decide to be stronger and not try to contact him because when I do I just feel like I'm being a bother to him.  I wonder if I'll always associate training, fencing, work, Japanese things and people with what has happened and have these visions of what did happen. Yesterday I went to buy some used DVD's and I saw "The Last Samurai" and "Lost in Translation", both of which I really enjoyed but I had to put them back because of this sick feeling inside. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I found out about when he kissed Julie the day before he asked me to marry him.  It's so hard during these times. There's a lull in the day and all I want is to hear his voice. I want to hear him say I love you. I want him to tell me how much he's thinking about me and the things he wants to do with me. I want him to tell me he wants me back home in his arms and to never go away again. I want so many things that I can't have. This all makes me wonder. Who does he dream about now?

      May 25, 2004 - This was the seventh month mark of my marriage. I found out my husband was very unhappy with our marriage and that there was a void within him where his happiness once was. This void was filled by another person, someone he saw at work. I never saw it coming. I should have I guess I can say in retrospect but I trusted him entirely. I had always tried to allow him to do the things he wanted. I've never been the athletic type so I wouldn't complain when he would go off training everyday. I had no idea that the past few weeks he had been messaging, calling, kissing and touching another person. It was a complete shock. My life as I knew it was changed. To top it off, I even wrecked my car and I was told that I was no longer attractive to him. All this in one day. I was told that she would be told not to attend his work any longer but as I'd later find this didn't last. At first we were going to go to counseling in order to work things out. We would see whomever we could to make sure of this. After a few days I was informed that this also was no longer the case. I was told by him that it wouldn't make a difference and that we should probably separate. I spent a few weeks living in a hotel until my funds diminished and have since been forced to move to Texas to be with my family. Supposedly I'm supposed to discover something about myself or maybe it's just to help me let go. Whatever the outcome, these are my thoughts during my ordeal.

      Last night I saw him online at about 1 a.m.. I figured he was just making his weekly updates on his website. I logged in hoping that he would see that I was home and therefore tempt him to call me but that didn't happen. I woke up at 5:30 and read my book for a while then went back to bed. He finally did call at 11 this morning. It was pretty much the same kind of conversation that we have been having. What we were up to and what we did this weekend. I tried my hardest not to show any emotion being that I'm gaining a reputation of being over emotional. Again, there were no "I love yous" or "I miss yous". I didn't expect there would be.  After our short talk I began to read my book again. I went out and bought the movie last night but I want to finish the book before I watch it. Unfortunately, as I read the book there is a second plot to it (actually the main plot) about an affair that was going on and has just been broken off. I wish I knew everything that was said between my husband and his girlfriend. I want to know if he still gave her hope that he still loved her but things just couldn't be. I want to know but just thinking about it breaks my heart. He told me when I first found out about them that he would always feel that way about her and that I just had to deal with it. I can't even think of words that can explain how that made me feel. How, if he felt strong enough about her to tell me this, could he claim to be in control of his actions now when he sees her? If he's already fallen for this once what is keeping it from happening again since she is still around. I wanted to tell him about these writings but I thought he would read them and feel like I'm both attacking him (although not on purpose) and being far too emotional. He probably wouldn't even want to talk about it. It would bring emotions into it and that seems to be something we're both trying to avoid. I really don't know how I'll be able to deal with things if we were to try to remain in contact because I'll always be hoping for something more than can be hoped for and I don't know if I would be able to if she is still able to see him even if there is nothing going on between them. I want to forgive and forget what he did. I want to correct the things that went bad. Maybe the wounds are still too fresh. Only time will tell, and it looks as though I have an abundance of that now. Every day I check his training diary. It's funny how the things you once thought of as hearing too much of you yearn to hear about when they are gone. He hasn't updated it since the 25th other than removing a mentioning of her earlier on in the month. It's hard to look at it. If I had only read it sooner I would have realized just how unhappy he was. There are only two mentions of me in them both with rather negative feelings associated with them. On one day in particular hurt the most. I didn't want to go to the gym that night and arguing about it would have only drained the life out of him so he didn't go but overall, despite the room change and everything else that went bad that day the day was a 10. Why? Well, suddenly, things perked up. This being a Thursday, the days I now dread. I wonder if this was the day of their first kiss. It really makes me feel rotten knowing that all this has happened. These idiotic things keep racing in my head. I think about the night that he was to tell her that things were over between them. I sent him a text telling him that if he touched her or kissed her that day not to even come near me. He said he didn't get the message until he was about to leave and he didn't come near me that night. It leaves me to imagine him comforting her holding her and telling her the things he told me before I left. I keep thinking he had feelings for her when he did this so he probably felt emotional when this all happened and it makes me so angry because with me it was almost like he was following a script. I wanted to feel his love for me in his embrace but instead I felt his need to be so far away from me and the unhappiness I've brought him.

      I can't say that I expected to be able to accept this so soon. I wish I could so that this sickness would go away. I passed by a girl today that looked just like her. I almost collapsed. I keep thinking. Doesn't he know that she will always have that hope of continuing what they had as long as she stays in contact with him? Maybe that's what he's hoping for. Maybe he just wants to wait the two years. I'm upset with myself because I still wait for him to call but I know he won't. Perhaps he thinks I'm out having fun and not sitting here alone with my hopes of the future shattered. I don't think he's even gone online. I wish I knew what he was doing while I'm going through this. I'm hoping he was able to spend the weekend alone like he told me he wanted to. I miss him so much. I have all these feelings but when I talk to him everything mean inside me just disappears. Maybe tomorrow will be more eventful. I am so tempted to check his phone logs but I'm forcing myself not to. It's almost too hard not knowing.

      As I drove home today I was listening to that song "Numb" by Linkin Park when I came to the realization that this is probably what he is feeling about things between us. That's why there's no emotion left. It suddenly hit me that we probably will never be able to be with each other in the way I wanted. My heart sank. The next song was "Burn" by Usher. I don't usually listen to this type of music but the lyrics of both these songs really hit me. I wanted to call him but I'm giving him his space. He can reach me if he wants to. It's starting to sink in that this is not just a separation. Things are actually over and I need to face that. I don't want to face it but there's really no way to get around that.

      As I've been here in the quiet of the morning I've been able to contemplate this situation. I've come to the conclusion that I feel as though I am his mistress and nothing more. I am here only to amuse him and to expect nothing back in return.  Thoughts pass through my mind of things Natasa once did to him while he was at work. Is there a chance of that happening again with this other girl now that he doesn't have to worry about me stopping by? Does he consider oral sex actual sex? As long as that girl remains in his life these feelings will always remain in my mind. Obviously he doesn't care about me enough to make these things better. I feel this horrible jealousy creeping up on me because I want what she has. I want him to feel that way about me. I never thought that I would lose him. It was only seven months ago that he vowed to be mine forever. I've lost the most important person in my life and there's really nothing I can do to change that but knowing that I can't affect the way he feels doesn't ease the suffering I continue to endure. I wish he would let me know truthfully what is going on. I feel like he's trying not to hurt me by not telling me something by allowing me to continue to lavish my love and devotion on him or maybe he's hoping to regain the feelings he's lost for me by accepting it. I want to know the truth but I am frightened by what I may hear so I remain in the dark because I still can't accept that this is happening. The thing that scares me the most, beyond what he may do with others while I'm away is that he's decide that he truly is happier living without me.

      I woke up with a stomach ache again. I had strange dreams last night. I just want to wake up back in my futon with none of this ever have happening. I know time can not be reversed and I'll just have to learn to deal with these feelings that I'm getting because even if we do get back together and I've worked through my other problems outside of the relationship I'm always going to have these trust issues, especially if he continues to hide everything from me. Oh well, we'll see how the day goes.

      It's raining here now. I'm trying to sleep but it keeps coming to my thoughts. He says he still thinks of me everyday. He could fool me though. It's been almost three weeks now that we've lived apart. He seems to have adjusted to that just fine. This day went by slowly. I can only hope to find a place to live away from here soon. I considered finding an apartment here but I don't want to commit to being here very long. I want to be back up there. I don't want everything to fall apart so I'm hanging on to every thread I can. I miss him terribly. I wouldn't know if he felt the same. As I said he claims to still care for me and thinks about me daily but I wonder what he thinks of me. I've tried to be a good wife. It's hard when you feel like you're just one of the kids in the house and not the one who runs the house. I've always taken the back seat to that because it would be improper for me to take that role being in his parents home. I wish we had been able to start our own lives together. Perhaps someday we will but the way he makes it sound is that he's already let go of anything we once had and any possibility of regaining that.  I hate that I can't trust him. I hate that I hate the things that remind me of what was done. I hate being away from him. I hate that he doesn't feel the same about me as I do him. I hate that I closed my eyes and refused to see it all. I wonder where he is now. I'd like to think he's at home wondering the same about me but it really does seem easy on him to be rid of me. I've done everything I can in order to try and repair things. I do anything he tells me in hopes I finally do something right. Every moment of this time apart hurts me deeply. I hope he's able to have his space without having someone besides me while I'm gone. I hope he decides that I'm what he wants. I just don't see that happening.

      This is so silly. I can't listen to teenagers talking or even look at an Asian girl without feeling sick. I knew he wasn't going to call today. I'm sure he expects me to be out somewhere with my family and not sitting around the house in my nightshirt reading a book waiting to see if he'll think of me. I just feel rotten. I used to like things that were Asian particularly Japanese. Just thinking about it makes me feel light headed as if my life is being sucked out of me. I know this is silly. It's just that the few things that I once liked I can't even stand to think of and it's not just because of depression. It's because it reminds me of him and her. Not that it would make a difference in me taking him back. He knows I want to be with him but all he ever does is tell me how everyone is after him as if I'm just another girl with a crush on him. He says she's like all the other girls that have a crush on him. How could he even say that after what happened? I'm sure she still thinks she has a chance with him as long as she still gets to see him and especially now that I'm nowhere around. Why can't he see that? I know he didn't want to stop seeing her. That's why this makes being here so hard to deal with. Not that it would be any easier if I were there. I wish I could take him away from her so there wasn't even the temptation since I know that he is so vulnerable to that as it is.

      Last night as I sat in an airport waiting to board a plane back to S.A. I couldn't help but wonder why I had to be so far away and she still got to see him at least 3 times a week. Am I not his wife? I was so surprised to see her there on Thursday. I was told she wouldn't be attending any longer but of course he has a valid excuse to let her show up. He doesn't want her to tell anyone and although he keeps telling me that he has no idea what I'll do next I'm sure he's not worried at all that I will tell about the inappropriate nature of their relationship. I still don't like it. I don't care how she feels. I'm being pushed away. I feel like he's hoping that through this distance that I'll realize that he was not the one for me. He tells me that I need rest and to get away from it all. Just being here makes my paranoia run wild. I can't get any rest. It's always so noisy and everyone is so loud and refuses to leave this situation up to me. I'm left here to wait for his call which I've done for over three weeks now. He only calls after I've contacted him. It's so hard to keep from contacting him. I want to be near him so much but he needs his space. I'm so tempted to try and find out who he's been calling and who he's been contacted by. Supposedly he's having a hard time but I can't see it when he talks to me. He talks as if nothing has changed except for the lack of "I love yous" and "I miss yous". Last night I cried when I thought of that old Cher song "Leaving on a jet plane... Don't know when I'll be back again" when I realized the next line had the word "babe" in it. That's what she called him. I can't even tell him that I miss him because it brings back memories of those messages they sent to each other. It hurts to tell him I love him because I know he won't say it in return. He tells me that things between them are over and I'm trying my hardest to believe that but what was I supposed to think when she showed up 2 hours before the time of the class after he told me that she wasn't going to be going at all. I have no access to his accounts anymore to check if he's been in contact for her. After all, I feel like right now, although I'm still his wife he sees me now as an "ex" and that I have no right to know what he's doing at any time. I tried to find an apartment here because I need some quiet time but it's no use. It would cost just as much as having a roommate up there. I miss my husband. I miss my cat. I miss the life that I thought I had. I admit that I wasn't happy with the house situation and that it bothered me that he was always away somewhere and I wasn't allowed to be around during his classes anymore and that I was always pressured to not go to tournaments anymore. I just wish there was something I could do. Everyone up there thinks that I'm crazy and that I need help. I don't think I'm as nuts as they (he) says I am. I was dissatisfied with our house situation and was under a ton of pressure to do well in school both by his family and by myself because I saw it as the only means of escape from the debt situation and the house situation. I think I'm supposed to just be down here and realize that he doesn't love me anymore and what's the use of being in a one sided relationship. It's so hard. I want to give him everything but I won't let go easily. I want him to be happy but at what cost to me? It's unfair of me to force him to stay in a relationship that he really doesn't want to be in. I think I would have felt better about it if we had at least had a chance to try to fix things together now that we both know that there was a problem but then again how do you fix the problem when the love that holds things together has become unglued on one end? That's probably why he said counseling wouldn't work. What other problem couldn't have been worked on? I can't believe that I didn't notice him falling out of love with me. I guess the signs were there. I remember him saying once that we were both unhappy and how he started to snap at me all the time. I thought it was because of this diet he was on. I thought he was grumpy because he was hungry. I'm so confused right now. I'm being sent mixed signals. Even besides the sex. I knew it didn't mean to him what it meant to me. I accepted that. It's just that he acts like I'm just off for another visit home. I want to just pack up and leave here and drive but I can't. I've been left with $10 after all the hotel rooms. I don't think I even have enough to fill my tank of my car. Besides, I have bills to pay. I don't know how I'm supposed to do that. It's as if he's wiped his hands of me. He may have paid for a few meals this afternoon but I can't expect him to back me financially. He never really felt he should have had to pay for anything for me anyway. So for the mean time I'm stuck in this noisy house with no plans for the future. I said I would stay until the end of the month but I just want to leave after father's day. I doubt I'll ever be able to do the things I want. I've been reading the book "Le Divorce" and so far there are so many parallels. I don't see why there wouldn't be. I'm sure almost every person has or will go through what I'm going through right now. I wanted to tell him to read it but I haven't gotten to the end and in a sense I'm afraid to get there. Will the book end with a divorce or will they work it out? The same question runs in my mind about myself. I'm not in control of the outcome although he keeps telling me that I've always had the control. I'm in limbo until he's able to clear his mind supposedly alone. I wish I knew. I used to trust him completely now I just don't know if I should.

      Dear Will,  I wanted to let you know that the strength I've been living off of has become weak. I've been trying to keep my emotions from entering our conversations so I appoligize if I've been cold in any way. There are so many things that I want to say but I'll refrain from doing so because you've heard them all before. Nothing has changed in the way I feel about you. I always loved being your friend, then your girlfriend, then your fiancee, and most of all your wife. I can't say that I enjoy being without you because that would be a lie. I will tell you that no matter what does happen, on your side or on mine, I will always treasure the times we had.   I told you today that I could never end our friendship or discontinue our conversations. That's true, I'm willing to torture myself everyday just to hear your voice on the other line in hopes that I can brighten your day. By no means do I want to end our talks or our friendship. It's just hard because the hurt I feel doesn't come only from the actions you took in the past, although that wound is still fresh. My wound is deepened on a daily basis by feeling like you can get on fine without me and that you would feel better living your life without me around. That thought is so unimaginable for me to feel about you dispite the pressures I get here to give up on you. I may not be the one you want now or ever. You may never regain the feelings that I have for you. I have to cope with that. I have to start my life again. Even though I've chosen to live my life in the city that you are in, I didn't choose it in order to spy on you or even because you are there. I go there only to finish my school and live in an area I enjoy living in. Although I would like our friendship to continue in person, I don't expect to have that happen.   As for dating, the reason I brought it up was because I still don't want to hide things from you. I don't feel like I'm ready to do that yet. In my mind I'm still a married woman and my affections are only for you. It's hard to feel the way I do about you and not get anything back in return. I guess you felt that way about me before all of this happened except that my love for you never changed. I guess I yearn to have the feelings returned. It's so tempting to just get it from another person but the thought just makes me sick. I'm yours if you want me or not. I'll never give myself to someone else willingly, emotionally or physically.   Right now I'm just happy to be on speaking terms with you. I don't ever want that to change. That's why I can't tell these things to you. I can only hope that someday things will change for the better between us. I really miss spending time with you. It was always a highlight of my days.  I guess things have gotten a little better. I've been keeping busy which has finally given me two days without tears. I guess that's progress.   I guess that's all I have to say for now.   Yours truely, Marisa
