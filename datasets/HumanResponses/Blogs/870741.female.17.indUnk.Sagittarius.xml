      Time is an issue to be addressed. People often think that time is just intervals between two occurrences, but time is so much more then that. Time is freedom. Freedom to use your time as you see fit and freedom to live. Yes time is living, the dead do not perceive of time. Well actually I wouldn't know that since I’m not dead and haven't asked anybody who is if they do. Anyway back to the living world....You can never misuse time. Sure you might spend it in a way that is not to your benefit, but there is no way of misusing it or even of using it unwisely. Even sleep is no waste of time, neither is procrastination. People have been saved for being late and often people think of great idea under the pressure. Time is complex. Ever try and figure out how the heck Back to the Future actually works? But time is not complex when it is seen for what it is, chaos. Time is an interpretation of the mind, minutes and hours are another thing. If time were truly measured by minutes and hours making out for two minutes would seem just as long as hearing a two-minute story from boring aunt Lilly.  Time is this big bloby undefined thing just accept it and you’ll be free, or you’ll freak out. Either way have fun with your time.

      Today I’m going to welcome everyone to my blogger.  I’ve decided to make it public because I thought hey why the heck not, someone beside myself might as well read them. It’s good to share. Maybe I’ll start some intellectual thoughts or just really bore someone and then they leave think nothing much of it. Click on the name if you want to e-mail me. Anyway, enjoy, or not whichever you prefer.

      You will always know what to write. How? Because if you think you don't know just decide to write about how you have nothing to say. Maybe that's a good thing, to have nothing in your mind. Maybe when you just can't write or you have nothing to say you're at peace. I wonder if we understand everything better when we just stop. Is silence knowledge undisturbed? Maybe or maybe it's just lack of sound, but when anything is simply seen as the opposite of something else it has never been truly explored or given justice to. So maybe there's more to this silence, this lack of thoughts and issues, this is how life is, quiet until we choose to disturb it with observation. Unfortunately we can't just sleep life away, I mean we could but we'd have a hard time with all the people calling you a lazy bum and our bodies wanting so many things. We where not meant to remain in silence. Life springs from silence and attempts too fill it up with something, but it never does. The silence is always there, constant. It is merely glossed over my sounds but never commanded by them.  It is absence and something seems to always be missing when something is added to that. In the end though silence is a void, the one thing that is complete. It never needs anything else to be better. Hmm this white paper has a lot of knowledge then, I think I’ll stop disturbing it. I have nothing better to say.

      School, like most things in life, is both good and bad. Good because you learn. Learning for the sake of learning is a beautiful thing. Knowing and thus getting closer to understanding the world that we live in is a great experience. However it is important to understand that we shape most of what this world is. So the ridged guidelines and curriculums of school and society, just don't do it for one who really wants to make this world a better place. Ghandi said, "you must be the change that you wish on the world." So very true. If we want peace we must be peaceful people and if we want the world to be understanding we must be understanding. It hasn't changed much since our forefathers and I mean really all the way back there, some time in the Paleolithic era. Monkey see monkey do. That’s the way it's been. One Monkey will have enough courage to be that change and gain both respect and followers.  But they’ll also gain what we would call haters. Haters just hate. They know you got something going on so they hate you for it. Some will just throw stones but the worst often say that they wanna “help” you or claim that they are being loving my telling you how weird you are so that you change. There’s also just the ones who sit on a thrown and judge you. Tell you that it’s “common sense.” Well duh but the point is for it not to be common, to be a change. Often the person who personifies change will feel very fragile and weak and maybe they are since they don’t have that back up. But just like when growing there are certain weakness and pains. Know this much, all individuals, protect yourselves. There is a thin line between a genius and a fool.

      Life is like really bad poetry. The kinds that are way too neat and have stupid little rhymes like “cat” and “hat.” But these stupid little simple poems explain to the letter how simple life really is. Don’t get me wrong, the good ones say a lot about life too, but they fail to point out that annoyance and the fact that our pain and our sorrow is fabricated by us and our need for drama. We like being the hero, the villain, the damsel, the knight, the misunderstood individual who holds the key to mans future, or that “lone wolf’ character who is made to be complex with its heart of gold. Yes, the stupid poems say something and like these poems, life without a little a twinkle of drama is dull. Monotony has never been all that cool really. So I say be content that life has given you things to complain about and things to cherish. Feel both sorrow and happiness to the fullest and once in a while be balanced too. It’s all good baby, unless it’s bad that is. But if it’s bad whine and bitch because that’s fun too and then move on to something else.

       Seasons don't fear the reaper Nor the wind, the sun, or the rain and we can be like they are (come on baby)Don't fear the reaper (baby take my hand) Don't fear the reaper (we'll be able to fly) Don't fear the reaper  by Blue Oyster Cult If there is one big lesson that we should all learn it's that all things must end. Accept it. Just live, because living is great. Really it is. Yes I know sometimes, maybe a lot of times, the pain of loss hurts, hurts so bad you want to end your life, but why? How dare you throw away this gift, this freedom to "be" just because you focus only on the bad aspects. There's is a lot of good out there, seek it. Experience the bad and learn from it. What is life but the continuation of a battle with problems, whether they are large or small? And the battles begin and end.  It's time we change our way of thinking. Acknowledge that there are problems, that yes shit does happen, but so what? You have been given all the tools you need to make it all better. Clear your mind and shape your world. You are an intelligent being, use it to your advantage. Be happy, be content, and strive for that by not striving at all and just letting yourself be.  “Don’t feel sorry for yourself, only assholes do that.” (  Norwegian Wood   by Haruki Murakami)  Does this mean that you should harden yourself and not cry or feel? Well gosh no, that’s insane. Do your amount of crying and mourn, there is nothing wrong with that. In fact it’s healthy, but for your sake don’t go around depressed for more then a week, that’s just not right. You don’t have to be courageous either. You don’t have to wake up everyday saying “I’m gonna beat this!” Do the opposite, chill out. In life there is ugly, there is beautiful, there sadness, happiness, crying, laughing, dull days, and sex filled days. It all ends and starts again and some specific things, relationships and lives, end for good. They end, you experience. Please seek closure, no need to pretend that you’re over things when you’re not, and maybe you will never be. Find a way to make that load lighter and those days happier, while those nights are as warm as you wish them to be.

      It is so important that people educate themselves about sex. Not just the diseases and the methods of protection, but also fun things; different positions, ways to make it more enjoyable, how it ties in with love, how it ties in with life. It’s a very big part of life. Why is it so shunned away or worse warped and perverse? It’s amazing what has been done to the concept of sex. It is seen as either evil or dangerous or necessary and entertaining. No we don’t need sex, sex is not evil, but yeah it is dangerous and entertaining. Yet we forget that it’s more then that. Sure it’s dangerous, you can get a disease, but it’s also dangerous because it can do some damage to your mind. It can leave you with regrets and odd feelings. It can also hurt you if you are not prepared, so be prepared and learn. Sex is also entertaining and, taken to the next level, a source of joy. Like playing a sport or doing other physical activities, sex can be fulfilling. It can bring you a rush of joy that stays with you for long periods of time, can make you feel whole, and bring you closer to someone. Of course this is all to be done responsibly just like any other part of life must be dealt with responsibility and honesty. There is honesty in sex that not many people care to see. Maybe it’s because there is way too much porno. The kind where the girl pees and everybody watches…hehehe  Save sex or no sex at all! (that's right save it) Sex can wait masturbate! No glove no love!

      I think I’ll write something about love, just to help my sanity.  Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.   It’s a quote by someone who's not me, but I do not know the man's name. I like it though. It's just like that; his opinion on it is beside the point. Stupid little love poems are also right and stupid love songs.  "Have you ever loved somebody so much it makes u cry?"  That's from Brandy. The stupid pop song is right. Ew. Notice the continuos use of "stupid"? That's because that's how you feel. Not because your self esteem goes down, (although with the wrong person it just might) but because the brain knows that there is no logic when it comes to love. To the brain it is stupid, thus so are the people who follow it. But what fun is it to play it safe? Take a chance; it might be worth it and it might not, but try your best to be wise. Don't confuse love with abuse or any of the other hurtful crap out there. Yes it hurts, yes you  take a fall, yeah you're gonna feel crappy and misused sometimes, maybe under appreciated, but that stuff about feeling good and being happy, that's true too. It's all-true. Is it worth it? You decide.

      Yeah so it's been a while. Sometimes life keeps you from living. There is a definite difference between merely having life and living. Having a life just means having responsibilities, this that you "have to" or "need to" do. Having a life is being busy, it's saying "i don't have time" when you use time for what you "must" do. Living on the other hand is noticing opportunity, taking risks, and not minding the stress of what you choose to do. It's owning your time and not giving it to activities, but rather choosing activities to spend your precious time with. Living is being fulfilled, having a life is constantly trying to live up to what's expected. What's more dangerous? living or having a life? Having a life can get you into all sorts of complications and much unneeded stress that you bring upon yourself, But the downfalls of living are far worse then those of a life. Having a life is doing a number of things that have little meaning to you, but have a great meaning in society. Living is doing what you want, what you feel and what makes you truly happy, but what if something goes wrong in the world of a person who lives a life and in the person who lives? the one with the life will feel less then the one who lives. To a person with a life things have little deep meaning, they simply move to something else. However, those who live feel very deeply about anything they do and if something happens it they are very hurt. Living to the fullest is risking falling to the lowest depths. it is harder to live then to have a life. The ones who live must ask why and how, but those with a life have it all planned out. Sometimes plans, obligations and social "musts" keep you from what is true. It is easier to live as a drone, but by all means take risks, they're more fun anyway.

      Be happy. People have a fear of being happy; mostly because they are afraid because they know that it’s going to go away. That is inevitable. Need I say again that everything comes and goes? But let’s continue the subject of happiness. Some would describe it as a drug. It stays there and gives you a high only to bring you down. Well, yeah but we’re not talking about the kind of low you get a week after taking E, we are talking about worse then happy but not bad and depressed. What’s wrong with reaching a high and then leveling out? We sure do hit rock bottom and level out as well. Why must we hold back and not indulge so much? All in efforts to not have to feel the loss after. Happiness is our moment that we earn for all our suffering or boredom or apathetic streaks or all of them combined. It is a gift that should not be wasted. If someone hands you a box of chocolates, do you turn it down because you know you’ll eat it? And if you don’t like chocolate then you can insert anything that you really enjoy in there and you’ll get my point. Indulge in happiness, it is your right.

      Jokes are great; they make you laugh. At least most of the time they do. They can hurt though. Just the right tone, the right words and use of imagery, and you just might hurt someone. But never stop the jokes. They heal from the inside. They make you see the stupidity in racial slurs and sexist innuendo, they break the ice and make you feel comfortable. Jokes are an art form. Never stop the art. It is expression and it is essential, but please use this art form well.

      Have you ever looked at someone, have been around them, and felt that you where on opposite sides? Then you go and find out about them, see their thoughts, like in writting for example, and you are flabbergasted. This person thinks like you and it's scary. They are saying the things you would say, but different; in their own unique way, but from the same source. It is disturbing to say the least. How can two different bodies of mass seem so different but spring forth from the same goop?. Should you not feel like this person understands you, should you not feel comfort? But you dont. You are disturbed because there is no comfort in this, there is only confusion and a realization that beings are complicated. They are contrived things of inexplicable porportions.

      Have you ever heard those disillusioned people who say that their boyfriend is the greatest one ever? They are lame and stupid. What liars! They don't have him. He is currently under the possession of a fluffy lil' bunny. Those people are full of crap and should get a life. They are wasting their breaths on someone who is clearly not the best. Get a clue. He might send you roses and write you poetry but does he make you feel like you are better then Jesus? That's right better then that cool cat Jesus, can he make you feel like that? I think not. So stop lying to yourselves. The bunny has the mystical best boyfriend ever.  Wow I'm feeling weird lol. HAHAHAHA

      Usually i don't write too much about myself but i'm gonna say something about my day just so that i can note down my good days. Today i had a spectacular day; today someone thanked me for making them think. If there is any better compliment then to have been thanked for having an impact on another human being, i don't know what it is. It's nice to see that we can do something positive. It makes me happy.

      Did you ever look at yourself and ask "when did the change come about?" Suddenly you're different. you don't like stuffed animals, pokemon is not cool, and you see teachers more as imperfect and often wrong individuals, not the gods you thought they once where. You've grown, no you've out grown your role, your expectations, your fears. They don't fit anymore. You don't fit anymore, or rather u have found where u belong, that's with yourself; your true self. That concentrated part that never seems to have a problem, all is at ease and conflict doesn't arise from this part of you. It is calm collect, wild and free. It is all parts of you, it is you and the easiest way to become that is to never define it and simply become it. Easier and perhaps harder then it sounds. A paradox.

      I finished watching Spiderman for the second time today. It was all right, but it probably didn't merit watching it twice based on the acting. However, something made me watch it again. We are all so obsessed with heroes. We want to be them, but have you ever really thought about how extraordinary you must be? How much really would depend on you? And how alone you would be? No one needs for a spider to bite them or to be from outer space to be a hero, but you must be extraordinary. Which means that you must handle being loved immensely by few but hated and feared by others. I wonder how many of us are that comfortable in their own skins, and that unselfish and gracious to take that on. I wonder if I could, If I could love so much that I would risk hate.

      Today is my birthday and I am beyond happy. These are the moments you live for. The surprise and that love, oh that love that surrounded me, that everyone gave to me, that was living. There are good people out there and there does exist hope for mankind. It's OK, the human spirit is not dead, love is not dead. So dismiss the cynics they have not had a day like today with people like these, otherwise they would not be cynics at all.

      Wow it's been a while. Yesterday was a very sad day. I hate to see people crying. I'm good at keeping a dry face even as my throat is clenched and my heart pounds. That is what helps me help them. Even if it's not much, just saying that it will be ok with strength and conviction can help someone. To those in the moment of weakness the strong people KNOW that it's going to be ok. And look at them, they are strong and they are sturdy, they know what's going on.  You can not convey the message of hope if you yourself become a mess with empathy. Although for the most part I can hold my own and carry this small little message, I cannot seem to stand tall when one particular person cries. My heart brakes and before you know it there are tears in my eyes. Often I have said that all things must pass and that the good and the bad must be accepted; however this particular specimen of a human being seems to deserve more then what the world has to offer. How dare anyone harm angels? You wonder if they even see it. Blind little fools who see the precious diamond like a clump of dirt. The angel is not part of this world, the rules of the wheel do not apply in this case. Heh I’ll go write a song about this...

      Hmm I shouldn't leave such sad posts up like that with without a cheery companion. But alas I have no cheer to give right now. I feel unconnected or maybe I just feel betrayed. Nothing is what it seems. Don't plan for the future and make idealistic notions in your head. The people you imagine with you, your setting, your wishes might all be and will probably be different. In anyway don't become embittered with the notion that you won't get what you want, because you have yet to really know what you want. Unless you do, but I suggest you doubt that. Now on to the topic of music. The Grammy nominations suck. They are usually bad, but not like this. This is just crazy. Makes me want to make good music. Not that there is a lack of good music out there mind you. There's just a lack of exposure. Then again it's probably the people and not the music. The masses don't seem to handle good music anymore. That would make them think and who wants that? It's just better to shake our asses. Don’t get me wrong I like to dance and I like that mindless music. However, for it to be praised above more worthy and content conscious works is just absurd. I've driveled on long enough. Hmmm I want cake.

Too bad that there is no man who can capture his strength and gentleness and too bad that there really aren't that many people in general who can see with eyes unclouded by hate or self interest for that matter. It's just not possible for an Ashitaka to exist because men suck. Darn, i wish he were real.

      OOOh too blog entries in a row. My best friend commented slyly that I haven't being doing a great job at keeping up with it. She always does that. It's always extremely indirect. I for one I'm a very direct persona and do not look kindly on that. However, for some reason when she does it I don't get pissed off. It's a spell I tell ya, she's working her evil magic on me! Nah she has more conscience then I do. Geeze I was a Jehovah's witness and she somehow turned out more Christian then me. Hehe. Oh dear I have written a whole paragraph on her. Now she'll stop dropping the subtle hints to update. I wuv you!!! :hugs: I can just see the expression.....heh heh heh.Muahahaha.  Anyway before I write an expose on her I have to talk about my English class today. I was really nervous and was anxiety stricken. Funny that anxiety and shyness was the very topic we where discussing. We where talking about how Laura, the disabled girl from  The Glass Menagerie  was freakishly shy. Now while I do believe in mental illnesses and the need for medication in some cases I do not believe that one should settle for medication. You have to work your condition out and take a stand. Drugs may help to relieve anxiety in times of great stress but it is really better to go to a psychologist and work through it rather then just masking it with a drug.  Now in this class I made a confession. I am naturally shy. Freakishly so really. I pushed myself into being an outgoing and very expressive person because I decided not to let people pull me around. You have to stop the self-pity and the victim act and you have to stop being self conscious. So many people are hung up on what other's think and they forget that what they think has nothing to do with what you are unless you let it become a problem. Now I realize that being self-conscious is something that doesn't go away for most people until they're 40 (at least according to my English teacher) however I think we should do it as soon as possible. The only reason we give in to others, one of the biggest reasons why we don't follow our dreams is because we are self-concious. If we just got rid of that we might not have so many people on drugs.  Let it go and be you, whoever that person may evolve to be.

      No matter what I say after this or what I've said before, do not believe in romantic love. Romantic love is a poison here to rid us of our sanity yeah so I'm a bit angst-y today. I found out that anything that has to do with that type of love is a lie. Don't aspire to reach the happy fairytale ending. In the end it's only friends that matter and the various significant others that you've had throughout your life time will have proven to be useless and more of a burden then anything positive. I have said that negative experiences make for good learning tools. I thought that good experiences might be like that as well, but there is always some negative behind the supposed blissful experiences. Hold your head up and be strong. By all means please do dream and dream big. Strive for that and don't get caught up in the frivolities of love. But if you did happen to find some genuine good old love that doesn't involve betrayal. By all means please notify me of this wondrous discovery. Love is like some sort of endangered species. It's as if HIV ate it and now it's masquerading about, poisoning others. All in all I just want to tell you to be clear headed and not let it cloud your mind. It is very deadly. Please be careful.

      Today I got a very special message. I was told that I was inspiring and that I amazed this person more than anyone else because of my insight. That is such a wonderful compliment. Again, I was told that I helped to see life from different angles. Then my I was told that I picked up my aikido moves fast and again I was told that I inspired. That is very beautiful. My kind of compliment. Forget being called pretty, although I was also called that today, it's all about having a positive affect on people. It all just picked me up and made me feel good. I thought that I was far more insignificant then that. I don't mean that in a negative way, I just didn't know that I had a positive effect. I'll continue to remain oblivious so that I can continue to project positive influence. I'm sure that if I knew I wouldn't be able to do it.

      Oh wow i am so bad at keeping this up. I jsut came back fromt he dominican embassy and i got  my passport done so that i can take my driver's test. Hopefully i can be certified to drive before senior year. Speaking of senior year, i think it's going to suck multo granos. There are so many responsibilities jsut mounting on my head. I really need to start doing them aswell. Maybe i wouldn't be so busy if i just did my work instead of letting it pile up. but then again, witht he hours in my job i get barely anytime to do all this summer work. OY. Well i think i'll just be a good taoist and let it all go. Wjatever the year brings, that is what it brings.

      I've come to the conclusion that I really suck at playing the piano. i have no sense of rhythm or of beauty. Really I just can't do it. I can't play very well. I always want to go fast, I wonder if i even pay attention to dynamics. My hands don't flow and neither does the music. It's all so very awful. Then I’m suppose to play with these really talented people. I wouldn't want to embarrass them and me like that. I am a nervous wreck and i just really can’t play. Sure my half assed way of hitting the right notes is ok but it's not good for anything professional or anything that involves people. OY, I am a horrible untalented person. OY oy

      I don’t even know why I keep this, but I guess that when the mood strikes me I come here just to write. Mostly to vent. I started this little shebang when I was going through an odd depression, now I feel it creeping in again. I know that the only reason I didn't just jump off a bridge was my best friend and the only reason I didn't completely right off everyone except her was because my boyfriend at the time was also very supportive. Of course part of the reason we broke up was because I couldn't take the whole sacrifice thing that he had to do and other things as well. Anyway, it's weird but no matter how hard I try, it all creeps back. I'm worried this time. My best friend is gone to college and she's really the only one that ever keeps me alive. I think she's the only person whose compliments don't sound like pure BS. I can't help it. I always think that the compliments are a form of patronization or some secret evil. I can't trust people and it's a serious problem. I think that's the root of all the hoopla that happens to me.  I fear it is slowly inching its way to my psyche.  I don't get it. I don't hate anyone, I am annoyed only by a few heartless fiends and yet I can't trust anyone. I can't get close to anyone, and when they try to I refuse them, because they are sacrificing themselves and why should they? I'm just an idiot who can't keep her mind straight.  I notice that I get worse when school starts and I think I know why. It's because I see them, all those people. Then suddenly I am reminded of just how unlike them I am, how alone I am. When I actually am alone I don't feel any loneliness. It's weird, I am very independent, but I do love people, yet I can never take their love too seriously. Again I believe that they are lying or at least their mind is lying to themselves. As if whatever anyone feels for me is the function of a spell...something unnatural.  Egh, I know it's just babble. I don't get it. I"m suppose to be smart I’m suppose to be strong and yet this thing just creeps over me. It wont go away. I know that it was when I lost my faith that it all started. All I had in my life was an odd entity who loved me no matter what and when I realized that he didn't love me then I was suddenly alone. But better alone then in a lie is what I say.  Meditation helps, but it can only help so much. I need a stronger mind or a less stubborn heart or perhaps both. But mostly I just need to believe in something, someone.

      Yeah, well that's a really depressing message. I'm not THAT bad. LOL. Certainly not a concert pianist. A friend of mine brought up a good point. He noticed that i would always build up and talk about how great a particular friend of mine is, but i never say anything good about myself, or notice what i do. He has a point. I seem to have some hidden inferiority complex. It's really just fear, that's why i always doubt myself. I'm so afraid that i'll fail that i just bring myself down, so that i could atleast keep my dignity.   But there is no dignity in self-defeat.  Actually it's a pretty dumb thing to do when you think about it. With all that's set against you, why choose to add on another pile of negativity?

      Oh dear me, i really don't update this. Well my life is sorta dull. I've realized that i'm way too grown up for my own good. I feel like i'm 16 pushing 35. In a way i almost see it as unfair, all this wisdom in this very young and exuberant body. Why must i see the consequences of heavy party-ing?   My parents are really smothering me. They want to keep me back. I've been presented with extremely great opportunities the ones that are like Prince Arthur receiving Excalibur. It really is sad how badly i'm kept back. I love them all but geeze, you don't get these kind of opportunities all the time. OH well, this is why i plan to move out next year. But that's easier said then done.  I miss my best friend. I'm sure she would keep me away from all the insane things that people our age do today and still make me feel like i'm not a thousand years old. I'm so happy for her, she's having a fun time at college. I hope i will to when the time comes. But i miss here a lot. I always knew i needed her, but a statement is never as real as when its being lived out.  On the other hand, thank the goddess for aikido. If not i think i might have gone into my depressive temperaments. I'm doing much better then what i was last year. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better.   At the same time i feel incredibly lonely. Not just lonely either, but only a kindred spirit will ease my pain lonely. I can't seem to connect with anyone. There is this grave feeling of being unloved. Yet i know that i am loved, but i just don't feel it. But, it's not depression, not too shabby. I think my level of feeling inadequate is at normal levels.   Yay for mental health!

      I miss my best friend. It was a nice halloween today and i was exceptionally goth-y with my super nice pants, but it jsut wasn't the same. I've realized how isolated i really am. I search for people that are like me, extend a kind hand, then find that we really have nothing in common. Throughout all this i'm not feeling exceptionally depressed or even sad. I just feel different. I love halloween. I wish i could do more with this holyday or unholy day depending how oyu look at it. I want to elongate it, but hey i have aikido tonite and i have SAT's tomorrow. Hehhee

      Hello depression, my long lost friend. So I cried uncontrollably for about a good hour or so. I know what you're thinking "got you're period?" Nope. It was just random crying I started to cry for one reason then remembered about another thousand things that I could cry about, and in the end none of what i felt for those events were resolved. It was just chaotic crying. That's when it's really scary, when it doesn't make sense. Sure my poor (literally) family is being overrun with ludicrous bills that we shouldn't have to pay because we didn't buy what is to be payed. And yeah I’m feeling like the dumbest person in the world because i can't seem to manage a good grade. Oh and I’ve come across proof that racism really isn't dead and that even with my light skin I’m still a target. Not to mention there is a bunch of stuff going on in DR which could very well shape the rest of my life. But most of all, I think I am so disappointed in myself, because i can't handle it. Because all these problems and others not mentioned are making me lose my focus and be less then I "should be." And no those aren't my words, they're my Sensei's. He decided to tell me that, to me and to my brother and some other guy that was there. He didn't notice that the comment would actually hurt me.  I think he believes that I have a stronger mind then what I really do. I really do have a weak mind. I'm not the crying type, I like to move on. But when my brain gets messed up, for whatever reason it maybe. I get these uncontrollable fits of crying. And it only makes me feel so much more pathetic, because that is not the type of person that I am.  But just because I’m weak doesn’t mean I won’t do my best to be strong. I know I don't exactly have normal brain functions at times, but I think that with enough will power you can beat anything. That's just what I’ll have to do. I just refuse to not be myself, to cry like that. That's not me. I am strong...it's just trying to make me weak...but I am strong.

      This blog is depressing. Christmas was good. my brother brought in his girlfriend. She was lovely. She was so proper and lady like. That's why my mother and father decided to yell at me for not being as lady like as she. I told them they should get over their illusions of me as their perfect little female. I am who i am. I'm not girly. I'm sorry...well actually I’m not. This is who I  am. Who ever that may be....   My mind still isn't straight. No crying at least. Just a mood. But i am better though. I just need to meditate more. I wish I could just enjoy...life is just too short. I'll just deal. I'll be alright.

But lo, no, the answer the key to resolving this whole thing is much better then bieng caught up in it. Ahh i welcome change. Stagnation is so comfortable and utimetly so unrewarding. Bring on the light, i'm ready to get out of this darkness.

      So it's friday the 13th and it's suppose to be a really bad, spooky, horrible, day. It's all good. Good day, good day. *sigh. That's the first time in a long time were a sigh was not a desperate call for hope. Now it's too much hope. Like hope is saying "i told you so." It's bragging. Let it brag. It has its boasting rights. We were all very wrong to doubt.

      So i'm updating again. Yesterday was not so good of a day. It was already wacked off for a reason. That's i thought. Either i did something wrong or it was preparing me for something. and what did it prepare me for? Well an ok day and a great night. The person i'm attached to asked me out. Three cheers Angie! But who knows it could be a friend thing. Still, stagnation is way worse then this. OH and my lovely british friend also got invited out. Again with the samefuzzyness of wether it is a friend or more thing. Either way it's pleasing to hear that someone sees how lovely he is. Now if only we could send whatever bug bit us here over to pittsburg...

How dare you think you're too good for my Angie!OH well it's his loss. Not like he was really good enough or anything. So i had a crappy daya dn those people taht i wanted to know it know. *sigh and unfortunetly i can't seem to shake an emotinal attachment to someone. bUt you know i'm really glad that i have my lovely british friend here. If it wasn't for him i might not be able to cope so well. He gives good advice and i adore him even when he's moepy. Anyway, keep on sighing my friends, your breath will always exhale and send you a signal, that yes, there is hope.

      Tomorrow i'm going to do a psychology experiment at the local mall. I have to pretend to have an abnormality. I was thinking of having OCD and just avoiding the cracks, or be a schizophrenic and have my own invisible friend, or simply walk around grabbing my left breast saying that my heart is pouring out, or wearing my underware outside of my clothes. I'm really not sure. An invisible friend may be good, but what if people see through my act? The cracks thing just seems too easy, grabbing the left breast could get me into trouble, and britney already did the underware thing. HMMMM i just don't know. I don't want to do anything overtly sexual, only because of the possible consequences, but then those are so fun. I love the social stigmata against sex. Should i challenge it? I don't know. Hmm maybe i'll blow kisses at women.....

      So waht to say of today? Nice day. Aikido was great, i didn't suck as much as i have been for the last 2 weeks. so that's good. I'm very proud of the people who tested. THings are going well with attachment boy. hehehe. But alas he is leaving for a college visit to (edited for obvious content). One of my rationalizations for trying not to like him and not persuing anything was college. We're going to different colleges, definetly. But, i think that the fact that i'm even taking that into consideration shows a commitment to well committing. I don't know, we have even really started anything. I suppose i might or might not change my opinion, things may evolve, i might just call myself crazy, but eh. There are a million possibilities, and for a man who has managed to prevent my murder of any attachment i have for him, i suppose, no i honestly believe it's worth it. Boy i hope i wont be eating my words later on. Hehe. Anyway, expirience things, take chances when they refuse to let you refuse them.

      Ok not in the dark. The answer is yes. What more can i say? Umm i just hope it goes well. I was looking at my previous blog enteries and the best ones come from when i was depressed. i mean there is some really good stuff there. Most of it where things that i wrote in ad esperate attempt to pick myself up. Of course i probably didn't really believe in them, i was just trying to find hope. BUt now that i'm not depressed, i realize just how true they are. They're good ideas and advice. This one is one that particularly gets to me.  "Happiness is our moment that we earn for all of our suffering or our boredom or our apathetic streaks or for all of them combined. It is a gift that should not be wasted. If someone hands you a box of chocolates, do you turn it down because you know you’ll eat it? And if you don’t like chocolate then you can insert anything that you really enjoy in there and you’ll get my point. Indulge in happiness, it is your right."  I really understand that now. But i don't think i realized then just how hard it is to accept and work for your happyness. It takes a lot fo commitment and self-love which is often lacking in many human beings. I if could say anything important to anyone human being in this world it would be, don't be afraid to be happy. It's ok if you fail, but you've already failed if you don't try.

      Nice actions should be reciprocated. Not out of obligation or anything, they just should be reciprocated. Don't you want to do something nice for someone when they are nice to you or do something nice for you? Why fight the urge? It's nice to be nice. It's nice to feel that being nice is appriciated. I just love kindness. It is by far the most adorable, attractive, hopeful, and sexiest quality that anyone can posses. It takes so much to be kind. Really it takes nothing at all, but fear of vulnerability makes it harder. It's fantastic! oHt he interplay between nice actions, one hand washing the other. It's so beautiful and i am such a dork for liking that, but ahh some things are worth being a dork over, like hope, like true beauty, like love, and kindness. I should make a bigger list of things that are worth being a dork over. Sure that would be great.

      I fell in love today. For one hour i followed a sunset and kept it alive in my mind's eye. It was so beautiful. The most dangerous and inviting colors of reds, oranges, and purples raced as i chased. for one hour it stayed there as i traveled west. Sometimes the mountains would conceal it, but always the sunset came back. I was in love. Our courting was so long and it's presence felt untill i reached home. My smile turned to a giggle from a crazy thought that maybe the sunset had fallen in love with me, that it stayed there, fought its fate until i was safe at home. And when i reached my house i recieved a good night kiss, and it is the sunset that i have to thank for this.

      How can one person mean the difference between a good day and a bad day? How can one single action, one ill thought behavior or sanguine transgression mean the difference between a smile and a flat look when you step into your home? Yet this exists, this person whose arbritratry actions and  lack of value in this meaningless world, carries such weight in your own unweeded garden that a hello and a touch of the hand can make the difference, the difference between sleeping and being in a dream or...perhaps a nightmare. What is this power? Do we freely give it to this person? Is it something they took from us? I don't remember anyone ever asking anyone else for such power although perhaps it has happened yet i doubt it can be taken that way. No, we somehow give it away...or did they always have it? Are they born special? Are we born weak?I don't know. I have an idea that it's us. We do it and "they" do it too. They give us such power as to mean the difference between a good and bad day. I hope i am able to give anyone who has entrusted me with such meaning in a meaningless world, a good day for atleast most days.

      So my object of attachment seems to have never have been attached to me. I really should go with my instincs and do what i do best, lead the relationship. I mean if i had just spoken out sooner it would have saved me a week or two worth of unerving anxiety. No don't worry, i am not blaming myself for all of this. He handled it wrong and i trusted that he wouldn't. No my trust isn't torn, no i'm not jaded or think that all men are awful or even think that he's awful. He has his own things to figure out. He's a bit of a coward. I dare say that most men are cowards. Always in fear of something so they strike back at everything and seek comfort in silence. But that's just philosophy. Maybe we're all a little scared amd i'm just being rough on men right now.   I feel pretty proud of myself for not being a coward this time. Sure i got hurt, but i think it was worth it. What did i get out of it? Courage. I can do this. I can be a person who beleives in happyness who beleives that two human beings can have a connection. I liek that about myself. I am so tired of fighting with myself over caring too much. So what if i care about others? I am strong enough to take the responsibilities and possible consequences of that. I am not weak and i am not a coward. I will nto be afraid to care for others and i will nto be afraid to own my humanity.

        You have a fiery soul. You aren't the quickest to get angered, but when you do get angry things can go really wrong really fast. You are generally very passionate in the things you do. (Rate my test)    urlLink   What force is your soul?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    So i guess i'm passionate and firery. It's true, it's true.  Today is the astrological new year. Usually it's on Angela's birthday but for some reason this year it's not. Very random. Anyway i think you're suppose to reflect on what you've done right and what you've done wrong this past year and then talk about what you want and are going to aim for this year. I guess i could write a whole book on what happened this year hahha. And i suppose i could also write a book on what i want.  I think i gave in to many people this year. Things happened that will probably stay with me and haunt me for the rest of my life (i hope i don't develope post-traumatic stress disorder). Somethings you just have to take to your grave. ..But i think i've learned from it all and i'm stronger for it. I am very glad that dispite all of it i have remained a somewhat sane person who is not jaded. I battled with depression all this time and i'm glad that i've recovered from it. I htink i've finally decided that i will not be a victim. I will remain strong. All i want for the new years is self love, love in general. and advancement in the mind body and soul. I jsut want to breathe and feel. I love living even if sometimes i hate it. Life, itsn't bad, it's simply complicated. Ah to live, it's such a miracle. I just want to live and evolve.  Oh yeah and it would be nice to get money. Muhahahah heheh

      I often wonder where our fear of emotions come from. I don't think it's so mcuh a fear of emotions because fear in itself is a fear and people wouldn't function like that. It's more of a fear of the sympathetic nervous symptoms reaction to emotions. i mean you could "feel" fear and hide it or dull it, but you can't stop it. What you can control is the rate of your heartbeat, how comfortable or uncomfortable we are, our anxiety. We all think that we're afraid of getting hurt emotionally but really we're more afraid of the weird hole that suddenly appears where your heart used to be, and the way food doesn't taste quite as good, and  the way we shake more often then winter should make us. They really are unpleasant feelings.   The emotions themselves i think are more rational then our bodies response to them. i always get very very cold when some emotional argument or intense talk is going on. I physically get cold. Now i can brave through all the drama fine, but the cold and not the emotional intensity is what disabilitates me. OH what the hell am i saying. I don't know anything. Maybe i'm just trying to say that we should stop fearing whatever it is we fear or at least fear it a little less.It's the how that's always hard.   I don't have all the answers all i have are dreams and perceptions  I wish the world a little more love. Its really not doign so well right now. Within my social group, the local area, and the world love seems a little scarce. I wish the world more love. I think i should make some. haha

      Well lots to talk about. Yesterday i went to New York City to visit FIT. The presentation was awful but then we got to randomly walk around NYC. That was crazy fun.Lots of walking in heels but fun. We met Quddus or however his name is spelled and he was quite nice and very beutiful. He gave me the impression that he was a very lay-backa dn accepting person. He would ahve been so ugly to me if he had been snobbish. That certainly a very fun day.  Today was odd. KInd of nice. I got picked to do the Freudian free response excercise in psych class. I answered very honestly. In some parts i sort of wish i hadn't. i called men cowards a lot and i felt bad since failed attachment boy was there. But i wanted to be honest and i was. They had some good interpretations. They missed on some very deep ones which was good. I mean i had a hard time controlling my tears when explaining my situation with men and why my associations witht hem where negative. I explaine that i never felt inferior just sort of cheated. And no it's not just about men in a physical relationship. It's about men in general.    Same thing when their conjectures about love and how i love love and need love. I don't mean to say that i need a lover or that i need a boyfriend. i just need love which to me equates to a compassionate enviornment that sees me for who i am, faults and all and yet still accepts me and empathisez with me and then i can do the same back. I thinkt hat kind of enviornment is nice. It is where i can thrive and argue and be, its where everyone can be their best. It doens't ahve to be all love dovey and perfect. There should be challenging and arguing but yet always a foundation of one understanding: that we all are beautiful creatures who deserve to live and live well. I like people, i like life, and i see a bright future even when i have crying fits or when i feel down. It's just not too far awaym never is.

      I don't pick up men. I'm not easly impressed, i mistrust people who try and pick girls up, i don't like men with egos, i don't like men without dignity, i don't like when guys try and fight with me, i don't like it when guys guy up in any fight with me, i don't like a guy who is without manners and tact, i don't like it when i guy is stiff and thinks about rules and norms, i don't like guys who are not in someway intelligent or wise, i don't like guys who know it all. I don't like to parade or sell myself out, i don't like to make extreme comprimises, i don't like it when i don't have to make some comprimises, if it's too easy i don't want it, if it's too hard i feel underappriciated. I don't want promises of forever, i think they're fake, i don't want that "just these moments" crap, i think that 's jsut a philosophy taht justifies using people. I don't like guys who are too serious, i don't like guys who joke around like idiots. I don't like tough guys, i don't like weakness. I like kindness, i like honesty, i like ideals, i like tough malleability (but still malleable), i like someone who wants to help, but not someone who wants to play the heroe, i like wisdom, i like falliability, i like to to be wanted and only slightly needed. I like comfort but i don't like mushyness. I like him to not prevent me from failing, rather helping me when i fail. I don't know if such a person that can be like what i (want? That's not the right word and neither is need, more like if i where to have a significant other he would be like this) exists. Well i can always stay in love with aikido. Haha

      People should take care of their bodies. There is this guy in aikido who is hurt, i mean really hurt. His back spasms and his shoulders are sensitive as heck, his knees are screwed up yet he wont go to the doctors. Why? He doesn't like it. What the hell kind of excuse is that? I told him he wouldn't be able to practice but he said "oh no i'll practice no matter what." Right that's why you took off one whole week of class on the count that you couldn't walk very well. Dumbass. What is up with all this macho shit anyway? I got really upset about how he said he wouldn't go. I was so annoyed i almost cried about it. It really scares me. The muscles around his spine contract and hurt him a lot. Fucking dumbass. As you can tell i display caring through anger. I don't know how to get through to the fool, the stupid, stupid fool. *sigh i was thinking i should brake his fingers and send him to the emergency room and then doctors could work from there. But emergency room bills are expensive.   I care a lot about the people in aikido. Shit like that scares the hell out of me. And he's the only one left from when i started training. All i have that's been there from the beginning are my senseis and this one stupid dumbass who'll end up leaving if he doesn't get his act straight. I think yesterday when my eyes started to well up i realized just how important that little group is to me. If  he can't train anymore it would upset me deeply. *sigh Stupid me for caring more then i should. I've always had that problem. But maybe that's what helps me be a good aikidoka, i care about what kind of pain you feel. It is more important for me to control what the person feels then to be able to get them off me or to hurt them. I know, i'm a fool. Damn this natural disposition for human love. *sigh It would be a blessing if people had the ability to react well to it.

      Egh a boy that came with us to Canada spread cold among us. Blah. Oh and i randomly got promoted to brown belt in Canada by Sensei Bruno. But all of you know that by now and what my confused feelings were on that.   I really can’t concentrate on math too long. I’ve attempted to study and it hasn't been working out for me. It's not that i don't understand it. It's more like i don't have the patience to just do it. Instead i get frustrated and my mind blocks so I put any answer down. So annoying. I think I’ll need some heavy duty meditation to get me through that 3 hour AP Stats test. I’m just hoping that I pass. Although my study habits aren’t securing that....  Monday I had aikido as always. The younger Sensei always shows techniques on me or the other blue belt, or rather the blue belt since apparently I am not one of them anymore. Anyway I noted how weak he was compared to Sensei Bruno. Still strong and filled with KI but certainly not the same as the elder sensei. I thought, if that’s how he feels in comparison to the elder sensei I must feel like a 3 year old child trying to hold down an elephant. Yet with that weakness always comes this possibility of greatness. How inspiring.  I’ve noted that my life is basically made meaningful through aikido. It also completely dominates my life. It’s funny, I’m going through this path of spiritual searching and being almost Hermit like in introspection. Now I see that way is unbalanced yet I can’t say that I yearn to be outgoing in the social field or to do things with everyone. Mostly I think I need a companion, but it can’t be just anyone. I think that if my best friend were back home or even my least older brother I wouldn’t feel it so much, but alas I feel alone. No, that’s not the right word, more like incomplete, like I need another half to urge me on in my little uncharacteristic quest for spiritual knowledge. I think I need someone to walk with me. There is really only one possibility for filling that role right now, but he’s taken. Even then he probably doesn’t have the same goals that I have. I think I’m starting to realize why my Sensei and the elder Sensei gave me that brown belt, I am set apart from everyone else. I live and breathe this and though it brings me joy it also brings me a sort of loneliness. After all being different means you are set apart. Before I used to think that I could be all alone and I almost hated anyone who wanted to get close to me, given some exceptions of course. I still am programmed like that but I’m trying to let others in, except that no one wants to come in and those who do are not able to get it. So I’m sort of blessed and doom, in another world so to speak. I was hoping it would be a little more inhabited but it’s not. Good thing is that it still makes me happy, a little out of it, but happy nonetheless.

      So i jsut came back from awesome aikido training in canada. I got to train with my Sensei's Sensei. Boy is he an interesting guy. He's about 70 years old and the strongest guy i have ever known. He's skinnier then anything, hiding the fact that he has enough power to brake your elbow with his ine finger. The man is truly something inspiring. He goes beyond just techniques. He emphisizes the "do" of aikido. That's more of what i want from martial arts. Yet to be honest, i can't say that i understand it. No one can really explain to oyu because "the way" is something tht cannot be described and therefore any explanation or definition tha toyu give to it is wrong because it defiles "the way." BTW i didn'y come up with that, the older sensei did, i paraphrase. I asked him all sorts of philosophical questions. He answered, but not in a self proclaimed sage sort of way. Instead he answered as a man who has gathered this information  from years of learning just about  anything and everything. He felt human. Somehow, he made me feel that his power and his knowledge was not beyond my reach or anyones for that matter. It felt like all it took was expirience, an open mind, and adaptation.    Alot of what i realized on the trip was that i have a long way to go. but is didn't dishearten me. It uplifted me, because it let me know just how far and yet how attainable it all was. There are small things that i didn't notice about myself that i learned. LIke the fact that i attempt to doge or move away fromt hings instead of blending with them. Of course any of you reading this probably don't get waht the heck i'm talking about, but who cares this is more for my benifit then anything else.  Sigh, i am so elated. I just want to practice aikido forever.

      School is a bit stressful. Mostly because of the whole AP testing thing. Sigh. i'm not sure how i'm going to do in english or statistics and now i'm a bit worried about psych. I dunno why. Oh i know why. The pressure! It's so much, it's unatural. I don't know how my friend who takes 8 classes is dealing with it. Man it's rough. Of course my studying has been minimal. Really i've studied more statistics then anything because i actually have to teach myself. Not that the studying i've done is much ^_^;; I'm just hoping to pass the darn test.    On a completly unrelated point i hate worrying about my body. I mean it's ok to say  "hmm i really should shape up a bit" or "maybe i need to control my portions" all that is health based so that's fine. However, i truly hate myself when i catch myself looking at other girls and thinking how pretty they are or how nicely shaped they are and i'm not. I hate myself for saying "all i want is just a tinier waist like that." Today as i was waiting for the bus i saw a bunch of girls who i would normally never see. *(They're those pretty but bumb types) Now some of them were just really skinny and not what i considered beautiful because, well, looking like you haven't eaten in two months is not too atractive. But some girls had these tiny waists with hips that were attractively bigger (that is to say not humungous) then their waists and they had long straight hair and their makeup looked like it was recently applied, unlike mine which fades and moves quickly. And their arms were slender, unlike mine which are close to being like a body builder. Not that i mind the athletic look. It's what i want. But my muscle isn't cut and trim and slender and somehow it bothers me. I hate that it bothers me, why should it when the muscles serve their function? *sigh sometimes i want to be vain and i should probably be a bit more vain then i am, but it's not rewarding for me. Well on i go with being body conscious and stressed. I shaoll be better next time i write.  ps.Congratulations to all those who glow

      Took my english exam yesterday, that went well. I can't say that i got a five but i definetly didn't fail. I'm hoping it's a 4 or a 5. I really don't want a three. I love english too much to only be proficient. Now my last test is psychology and i feel pretty good about it. I took an AP exam from 1994 and got 90 out of 98 questions right. With that alone it is enough to pass the test and then all i would need is a minimum of about 3 points on each essay in order to get a 5. I feel confident, but then who knows. It might just surprise me, i'll test and study this weekend just for safety reasons.  What's great about all these tests is that they're done. Haha. And as they are completed i wind down a bit more and i am more content with my life. (although as i write this i just got slapped by my mother because i repeted something vulgar that she said. Not fun). Anyway, even with  the slapping mother and other various complications, i am greatful. I'm glad i have my family and my place with lovely heating and plenty of windows and school gets less troublesome. Of course there is also aikido. I am so happy there, although i must say every day i feel like i have too many questions. Is it normal for a brown belt to ask questions as if she has never seen a movement before? I don't know. It may look bad, but in my mind i am always a student who knows nothing. There is always something knew to be learned about the first technique you encountered pre-even white belt status.   With this new blessing of free time i find myself being more intellectually engaged. I go to the library often. I read and am currently re-reading "The Stranger." Also i'm getting back to writing both poetry and short story fiction. I am also watching movies that i've never gone to see in the theatres. As i observe that this is what i'm using my free time on, i realize that i am secretly an introverted person. If you put me in a crowd, specifically one that i know, i can be comfortable and extroverted, but honestly i don't seek out those things. Thinking about them makes me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes i wonder if my lack a zelous search for companionship and just "something to do" might have left me lacking in emotional connections. To be true, i like everyone i'm around and i care about what happens to them and i feel like helping when something goes wrong. This is what i'll call "humane attachment." My intrest and attachment to them do not go beyond the sheer fact that they are fellow human beings who deserve to be treated accordingly and deserve happyness. There are few people that i can say i love beyond that, and the number really dwindles down when you don't count my family. Couple that with the fact that i fully believe in letting someone go if i've become obselete or a block in their development and i find myself alone. It's a bit too alturistic or should i say masochistic then is healthy. Sometimes i think that maybe i should have searched for fun frivilous friendships and that somehow that would enrich my life and give me expirience. But i don't know if that's my style. I think i'll try more to have fun though...if i can find it.

      OK so i failed that. NO i'm not kidding i failed it. It's pretty likely that i did. I mean i was kinda pleasantly surprised by the multiple choice part. It was a lot of theory and very little calculating, went by smoothly. Then i get to the free response and i utterly bomb the whole shebang. I'm pretty sure that i'm getting a 2. There is really no way that i'm passing. Not unless i did so fantastically well in my multiple choice that it made up for the the one or two points that i'm getting for each question on the free response. I'm doomed.   IN other horrible news. I have been waiting for something i bought a friend of mine through the internet. I go track the package and it says that it was all ready recieved and confirmed and guess waht? NOTHING has arrived. I am very very pissed. Apperantly it "arrived" last thursday but no one was even here at the time that they say it came. I am very very pissed. I'm not sure if one of the neighbors took it or if it's in the post office. Anyway it's very annoying.   I made it from my house to the library in 5 minutes. Haha. It was almost closing time and i desperatly needed to go there. I ran and got there at light speed. In sandals! I've been going there like every other day. I love the library. I love reading. Forget math...that bastard.

      AP week! WOOO. It starts for me tomorrow. I've decided not to run from the lovely stat test that i am doomed to take. I called my college and it turns out that from now on they only take four and fives and only after careful consideration from the lovely dean. Oh well. I just want the credit from my English and Psych tests i really don't care that much for statistics. Although if i get a three i will be happy because really that's all i want. I just want to be proficient in the darn test not like a masters or anything. The problems witht his test and me is 1) It's math 2)While i can learn math, what i've learned tends to leak a week from testing it 3) i didn't have such a great teacher 4) i wasn't such a great student and 5) which is really the one that brings me down, i have little knowledge of how to use my lovely calculator. Man five problems is bad. Well, i will take the test anyway hoping that i will pass. Then i will go home to re-read the stranger and Catcher in the Rye as well as going over any of my essays for Ap English. This will go on from tuesday to thursday and it shall be fun. I will go to aikido on wednesday because well i can't not go for 2 days that's just horrible. I'm not going today becayse of math studying which i need a lot of but i am doing nothing on. Instead i am reading and writing some really good short stories and just little poetic lines that will some day make their way in to some published articles. I was reinspired by "Five men who broke my heart". AP english had been killing my love of reading and writing and my creativity. Afterall, when you're learning to write as others would want you to write you get a little pissy. Well off to study i go. I shall update on just how horrible the exam was.

      Marlen is a brown belt marlen trains with swords. Man that's so cool and interesting. I belt you if i was a guy i'd have trains of girls who adored me. But since i'm a girl i have trains of guys who fear.   Well, except the stupid self centered idiots. Yes they are twice intellectually inept. This very horrible ignorant (which is way worse then stupid) homophobic, rapublican (yes in this sense it is said as an insult) dared to ask me to the prom. EWww. Darn me and my politeness. Just because i return his hello's and don't trash on him he has the nerve to make stupid sexual comments and then to ask me out to the prom. The nerve! I suppose i should not be such a snob right now. I would be flattered if it was guts and not ignorance that made him ask, but we all know it wasn't testicular fortitude that did it. Oh and if he wasn't such a homophobic asshole with pretensious faulty christian egotism.   I so want to be a writer. I just read "Five men who broke my heart" and just thought it was awesome. It could be my life soon. It's a memoir from a freelance writer on the five men from 13-35 that she fell in love with and then had a tragic ending with. She eventually ends up with a comic writer for Seingfield at 35 and then tries to have a baby with him but is unable to at 40. Anyway it's really funny and she's just my hero. I mean she's terribly fucked up. She smokes pot a lot and gets off on her boyfriends having sex with complete strangers which ends up being prophetic because most of the five men actually do that and then leave her. What's funny is that she's this freelance writer and her best friend is an architect and they both live in Manhattan and i thought how that'll probably be me and angie in a couple of years. They are both the very successful career women which i like, oh and lots of sex with very attractive men. Utimetly though they have problems finding true love or rather keeping it. They sabotage their love filled relationships or just pick the wrong guys to date. Wrong guys being very attractive men with commitment issues and great skills in the bedroom (or in a hot-tub or outside in a park or many other locations). Yup that'll be me someday. i can't wait to fuck up my life so that i have enough to write a great (selling) memoir about. Hehhe. Minus the abortions, i don't think i could ever go through those. Note to self, don't get pregnant, you're not yet selfish enough to pick a career over a baby. Damn my motherly instincts.  I've been thinking a lot about the rest of my life lately. I was awful at being a child and a teenager. I really went from 7 to 35  back to 13 and then to 26. I'm stuck at that age right now. I think i'll attempt to revert back to atleast 21 before i go further then that. Oh man life is waiting for me...or i'm hallicinating.

      Ah the last AP Exam. Good' ol psych. It was a good test. I think i have a big shot at a 5. I hope i wont be disappointed.  Prom is coming up and i havent got a dress and neither have i payed my dues. On top of that my brother is here to add to the mooching of money. So yeah things are gonna get financially more fucked up for me. OY  AIKIDO at the mall. All of you must come, near badbages all this weekend!  The one thing that got me mad today was the postal service. They swear they delivered the package. Well i didn't recieve it and neither did any of my neighbors. So what i'm i suppose to do, just forget about it? That's my hard earned borders money i got there. It's also my friend's present. That's what really pisses me off. What i'm i gonna get her now? I got an idea but no income to supply it. Well i guess i'll just have to resort to selling my body. MUahahaha.JK

I suppose it's good that i go. I really can't wait for college. First though i'd very much like some money. I wnat a good stable and fixed job that i cna rely on. I really hate not being in charge of my finances. man life costs a lot of money.

      Went to see THE WIZ with my dearest angie. The play was very good and after it ended someone proposed to his girlfriend. How cute. She cried so much though, i'm not sure why. Is it that important that you have to bawl out fo control. You'd think her life depended on this, but then maybe i'm removed from the emotion so i don't know what's going on. Lots of people were crying. The senior class and our little robbie-roo weregoing crazy with tears. Frankly i'm glad to graduate. I feel the need to move on i guess. There's very little left for me here and nothing that i feel i have to hold on to.  The lead in the play and the girl who played the scarecrow were very good. The scarecrow is going to the same college as me. I'm pondering being her roomate, but then i might want to just have a random person be my roomate. I kind of want somethign completly new i guess.   You know i just noticed that i haven't passionetly kissed anyone for about a year now. Hmm i'm out of practice hehe. I feel so unused. But i don't jusy kiss anyone so it's alright. The only thing that's not alright is the fact that i've been attracted to the men who are either emotionally or actually not avaliable. Little principle-filled me would never act on that. Sometimes i wish i would. Poor libido, so very repressed. hahah  angelina showed met his pillow book from a girl. I think i'll do one of those some day. Every woman should. Then every man should read it. So they can be sure to do the things that the woman writes good things about.  The Wiz was yesterday, today was the lovely Joe Kopta tea and cake gallah event. It was so nice and fun fun. He really wasn't kidding about baking all those cakes. They were so delish. His mother is on my list of top ten keenest moms ever. We even got a present at the end of it all. I got a little wallet and guess what? It had bunnies on it!It was just so cute. I felt like i should have paid to enter. I mean it was just so selfish of everyone who wasn't a kopta. We were like poor people being served at some fine country club.  I pretended that ai-chi was my woman. It's always fun to make a scene hehehe. I fought for her with john. Of course i won. By the end of the year we'll be rumoured lesbians. Although i might already be a rumoured lesbian...i'm not sure. Oh well, whocares, we're leaving school anyway. June 9th is the last senior exam, 2 weeks from now. FREEDOM.

      So little ol' highschool is ending. I'm relaizing jsut how anti-social i have been all this time. I went to only my prom and that was it/ I can't say that i regret, so much as i wonder if i could have been a different person during this little highschool time. But hey, i came out with dignity in tackt and i'm not too much of a mean bitch. Being a good person is what it's all about.  Dude, infections suck. I really hate when illnesses or whatever the hell they count as hit my friends. I mean all you can do is sit back as they tell you that they can't move without pain...or pain killers. Down with the sickness.   Read " coffe and KUng Fu."  It was superb. All about a woman who sees life through Kung fu movies. It has some great sex scenes and some heart wrenching ones. Makes you believe that life only sucks when we stop believing in ourselves and in mystical connections. Anyway, read it.  Watched  LOve Actually . I have to say that i really like that movie. My favorite story is the little boy. Then i like the one with the prime minister and then the one with the foreign house cleaner. The one about the office woman and the extremely hot and "fuck me now" sexy co-worker that she has been in love with just makes me depressed. She basically gives up her happyness for her sick brother. But that's love too. I kind of like that it showed that love was more then just positive. It includes risks and sometimes you don't get what you want out of it. Of course the general message is positive:"love is all around." We're not all apathetic beasts, no matter if we try and numb ourselves to it. I take pain over apathy any day.  However i think i'd rather have love. According to the tarot cards love isn't going to be around much this year at least in the boyfriend form. I'm just gald that i'm actually feeling stuff. That i'm not rationalizing every single feeling away. The key is to be open to painful stabs. haha. But i don't think anyone is taking a stab anytime soon.  I'm very happy for a friend of mine that i sort of nudged to ask out his current girlfriend. Way to go man! I am so happy for him. Funny thing is that i'm not jelous. Not of him or the other relationship that i helped come together. Oddly enough i threw my ex boyfriend at someone. Hahaha. But they are happy. I'd figure i's be longing for something like what they have since i got rejected by the one guy i really liked. But i'm not. I'm happy with just having a bunch of friends. But i think that i seriously need to make out with someone. Hahaha.

      I'm trying to get a handle on all this new technology stuff. I swear, compared to most of my freinds i am computer ignorant. It took me so long, even with the help menue to get my profile up and this picture up. Speaking of profiles i never knew blog people had them. Now i'm finding tons of people with interests in aikido. Oddly enough with liking aikido some like guns and violence and hurting people. Hmmm i wonder how that came about. My sensei works for the state and he has guns but i wouldn't say that he adores the thought of having to shoot anyone or to even have to hurt them. Although i think that when catches the really dispecable criminals he gives them one for the victim or for his sense of justice, whichever.  Speaking of the topic i love the most, aikido, i was acting sensei today as well as yesterday. I was very scared of the thought of having to teach class all by myself without my sensei watching and without Blue Belt to help me. He went of to Rhode Islans for supper fun. I wish i had less serious fun. I digress. Yesterday was an ok class. I think that they did learn at least something and got a kick out of it. However, i believe that it wasn't such a good class. I didn't do well as a sensei.   However, today was a different story. More confident then last night and better prepared, i brought in my A game. Man i work those 7 people who were nice enough to respect me and show up so hard. But it wasn't just hard, it was enjoyable. Everyone left saying that they were sweaty and disgusting and that it was a "really good class." I worked on their breathing and their movement while doing bokken work as well as techniques later on. I think they really liked the drill where the person goes to stab you and you have to move (correctly) out of the way. All in all i did good. I was very happy to have everyone exclaim their pleasure. YAY. Someday I'll really be Marlen sensai. WEEEEE.

      Reading "the unbearable lightness of being" and finding it very very good. The philosophy hits me where it counts, a place i would not reveal here for fear of my enemies attacks. Anyway, it does make me question the worth of life, or a life to be more exact. After all it carries no weight and its sins are forgiveable through angular exploration...whatever that means. Anyways lately i've been feeling, and i use feeling because imagining is not dense enough to convey what has been going on, i've been feeling my mortality. That is i feel and see the degeneration and braking of my body. I see my bones braking or my skull caving in or a rush of blood flowing from me. I see this more often during aikido where i have come to the realization that i have a lot of knowledge conserning the destruction of the human body, and to an extent, how to control it. I see the real possibilities in the application of many techniques and just how close to braking our bones we come to in our practices.   I suppose i am realizing my power to destroy as well as my weakness in being able to be destroyed. I imagine myself commiting suicide or being shot, being killed in some gruesome unromantic and utterly brute form. And i think what i'm afraid of isn't the pain, but the calm after the pain. I'm afraid that there is nothing beyond this body, beyond this instrument. Perhaps we are the instrument, not just the users of it. It seems sad to have such a short life. It seems sad to be so insignificant. Then i realize what sort of effect my death would have on people. Specially my mother. Then my mortality is even sadder because although i am insignificant someone has placed an unworthy value on me, and the loss of this insignificant thing will cause pain when it shouldn't.   What bothers me the most is that death has never been an issue for me. I have always believed int he continuation of being after this form has been lost. In fact i have experienced enough to find my unconscious doubting quite disturbing. I am doubting what i have seen and expirienced and i don't like it. Is it because i have slowed in my strictly spiritual journey? Life after death was so very real and tangible to me...and somehow it still is yet it is being question by the realization of ending. That there is an end, isnt there? Or is there just a pause? I'm inclined to believe that we pause. That the spark of energy which powers the vessel does not immediatly go to a vessel but rather it becomes part of the fabric of the world.  With this realization of mortality i have come to see that destruction is needed for continuation, for thriving. The destruction of plants, animals, and people are all necessary for the long term continuation of plants, animals, and people. Of course there is always a balance. Thousands of years from now we will hit an ice age and the population of human beings will be much smaller and civilization will be shaped again. Nature will balance the continium between life and death so as to continue existance. But the sun will at some point burn itself out. Then what? Do our little energies exist only as part of this world? Or does it exist beyond it. *sigh, existence is so irrational and inexplainable. Yet i so adore it...even when it makes me considerably uncomfortable.

      Graduation happened on the 15th. Hurray. I can't say that i was excited or sad or much of anything. I was just going through the motions. The dinner after was nice. Packed with the fam and angie. I kidnapped her because her parents didn't want her to go with me. It was much fun.  Today was a couple of friends' party. John gave me a ride there. He's a good kid. In the middle of fun we realized that we weren't having super fun because ai-chi was not there. So we got her. She had just woken up. SURPRISE. Her parents scrambled for cothes as did she, while john and i walked around her compound. Then we nabed her, went to the highschool to get stuff except it was closed so no stuff was gotten. Then we went back to party, played volley ball. Funned some more. I got despondant after realizing how much i don't fit in. I think i'm searching for some reason to exist.  On another note i was given a lecture about how women were made for the comfort of men. I was told stories of male slutyness which was of course taken in with applause and cheers and approval. Then i was told that mens hould do that but not women because that's "degrading their bodies." I love how some men really believe that they know what degrades and what empowers us. I've come to notice that men think about sex and a lot. They want it and they think it's all right to hurt someone for it. Not neccessarily physically but emtionally. We're just objects most of the time. Being appraised and traded everyday. I hate it when i see the injustice in the world. NOw the question is, what am i going to do about it? How am i going to do my part to stop this "boys will be boys" crap? Well i jsut don't know, but i really would like to do something. Even if it means a lot of people will hate me. Oh well, it's not like i'm loved much, might as well fill fulliled and hated.

      Yesterday was fun with JOhn and Ai-chi. We went to shrek2 and killed some brain cells as well as got owur money stolen by that corporate machine. It was a lot of fun. The we went on a little hike for even more fun. John should us a great view that scared the hell out of me. Since it scared me i naturally had to challenge it and walked over to "the death zone" as john called it and looked at the big trees below me. Then he showed me the watertower, aichi had already been there. I climbed a fence with barb wire and i had sandals on, i was proud. Un fortunetly my short hands couldn't reach the railing to the water tower ladder so i couldn't go up. Some day i'll challenge it again though.  After watertower was john's mom, a wiccan who i wanted to meet. It's nice to be around people who meditate and do a little power work, mostly because i'm obsessed with reading them. She was very nice and loves nIgela lawson who is my goddess of cooking. And she's hot.   After JOhn's mom was ai-chi's mom and more food then we could ever deserve. I ate like crazy but john eats slow and his stomach is tiny. The two girls ate more then the guy, a true rarety. We watched a jet li movie and chilled out in euphoria as ai-chi's mom brought out water melon, chinese dessert, and good ol' cookies.   I arrived home before 10 in order to be greeted by an angry father and a mother who started to beat up my arm. Apperantly they had all been worried about where i was. Considering that it wasn't even really nightfall yet that's rather odd and considering that i told them i'd be at a friend's house after the movie. that was also odd. Who panicks and looks for their kid at 7pm? It's kind of crazy to say the least. Angela got a visit from my dad and my borther called her two times because my parents guilted him in to it.I'm sorry my dear friend, but my parents are paranoid. I think i'll jsut call next time. Although i really really hate the fact that i have to call. College seems that much more exciting now.

      Yesterday or rather early today morning, the wonderful Jack's personality and conversational funness made me stay up till almost 3am.We were trying to figure out what it was i wanted to say in my last post, that is we expanded on the sophmoric verse i spewed the other day. I'm pretty sure we made the required sweeping generalizations and deviations from the topic but we did get some truth, unfortunetly i can't remember because my brain is still craving sleep.  I can sort of remember this mornings aikido class though. I've realized that a lot of the things i can teach and the things i know, have less and less to do with actually having done them and more to do with knowing the philosophy of movement. I can create some nifty stuff.I taught class today and it was considerably easier then the last, but i wanted to concentrate more on techniques today. And the late night had me tired.I encourage people to learn the philosophy of movement somehow as well as how to move your energy.   Speaking of moving energy, anything you do is sent out as moving energy. For example, my attack of man hate sent out a burst of offensive and defensive energy that pushed back all man energy. I was talking to a friend of mine about how weird it is that i haven't kissed anyone in a whole year and he says "you where the one going on about man hate, and then you're surprised?" Right then and there i think i loved him more. I love it when people tell me truth like that. I like hearing the good stuff and i really appriciate hearing the critical,  anything that helps me know myself better is welcomed.   Lets talk about contact again and my continual use of agression and abuse to feel the weight of my existence. Or lets not because i've suddenly lost my words and i have to go to work. Man i really can't get this idea out of me.

      The need for contact is a very real and  very important neccessity for the expansion and growth of the human being. In fact, it is so important that babies who do not recieve comfort, i.e attention, caresses, and contact, die even if they recieve all other bodily neccesities; food, shelter, non-human warmth. While this was a scientific experiment with babies, i believe that when looking at the older population we may deduce that even at such an independent age, we crave, desire, and utimetly need a warm body to touch. To a certain degree there is a sexual need, but it in no way matches the less specific need for comfort. A mother can get by on her children's love and warmth alone for very long. To have someone hug you and laugh with you and simply expirience with you is one of our greatest needs.  Let us then explore why we may need this comfort and touch. It may simply be for psychological strength, which ultimetly translates to physical strength as well. This is a probable answer. However, i propose the following: contact between humans is needed for the assertation that one exists and that such existance is important and welcomed in the universe. In the embraces of others we feel their weight, we feel their weight on our weight, thereby giving us a conscious feel of our physical body. Therefore, we exist in this form that is being touched, that weighs less or more then the body next to it, the body that is not yours and is someone else, thus giving you an identity on which to seperate yourself. The person also acts as a witness of your existence. They can verify, that you exist and play a part in their lives, thus you are important. There is reason to live when you both feel your existence and the importance of it.   Look at those who commit suicide. Aside from those who commit seppuko out of honor, suicide is done out of a deficiency in human comfort and warmth. Our existence is not noted and reinforced by someone else and thus it is neither important nor necessary in our eyes. We may also apply this explenation when seppuko is commited out of disgrace. Once you have lost the adoration or respect of others due to your failure, your existence is seen as invaluable.   In my case, this is an extremely underdeveloped thesis.I may expand it later when i find the words to explain our counter need for isolation, commonly known as "space." I believe that this too has to do with our need to validify our existence.

      The horror, that's all i can say about my left foot, twice it's size and truning from red to purple, it's one of the most unattractive things i have ever seen. The orgin of such a battle wound? I'd like to say it was when a 300lb man elbowed me in the foot...for some strange reason. But it wasnt. It was a freaking bug. Proof that the loliest creatures have a vengance. I recieved this parting gift at andrew's party, where he received food, elementary games, gag cards, a lobster, a bunch of ice with one can of soda (because john is a horrible friend), CD (because john is a good friend), and the idiots guide to tantric sex (because i am an extremely practical friend). FUN was had and i beat up people and the bug got me.  Today i trained as a JC PeNNY's sales associate for shoes. I rock. My foot is really the most unattractive thing to be in that department. I'm hoping the swelling will be gone tomorrow. I made a sales for 2 shoes in like 10 minutes. It pays to know spanish. Tomorrow i work from 1pm till the night. Then Friday it's 10am till 5pm and then saturday it's 4-closing. The adventure of making money begins. It should be painful.

      So today started yesterday with a good night sleep. I slept because i needed to get up early and wash the Gis. My brother has done them for me before when we didnt have a washer and a drier so i don't protest to doing it for him. After that there was fun.   JOhn, who i call Jack in momments were i am using more energy or just when i feel more connected, picked me up at 1 for super swimming fun at lake candlewood. I was busy trying to persuade ai-chi to go with us when he got in so my borther let him up. Ai-chi declined and then my brother persuaded us to go to this really easy to find lake that was cleaner then candlewood. Since we are dummasses we got lost for half an hour and then found the place. It was very nice. The nature is awesome and i loved our hike. Then we found a nice rock ensamble. Jack got naked behind a rock and changed as i pretended to peep because i didn't want him to feel like he isn't worth a peep. Then we funned in the water. As in we had fun swimming in the water. We encountered slimmy rocks and sticks and i encountered my inability to swim very fast. Jack taught me how to tread water and i succeeded.   When he was hungry and cold and bashful over something, we sat some more and i laughed at his misfortune. Then i took pity and we put on clothes. I found out my toe was messed up from the rocks. OH and on the way there i stabbed him pretty hard with a pencil and caused bleeding...i really odn't know my own strength. We got fake chinese because that's also good and then other stuff happened that was funny and inconvinient then eat then home.   My brother and i then walked to aikido and we had a full and very very nice aikido class by sensei marcos.Then we rided over to home.   What have i learned? I am never too tired to do aikido, i love swimming, Jack and i compliment each other in fake angry ways and some more but that's more important, i really like walking even if it hurts, i want to do this again again and again. When was the last day i was really happy? Today.

      I'm not sure if it's good to post twice the same day, but then it is the first hour of tomorrow so i guess i'm not posting twice on the same day. Well then there goes my first ramble.  Here goes my second ramble and it is one that i truly hate as i am wont to be annoyed by vanity, though i am not sure wether my observations and criticisms were inspired by meere vanity. They were probably inspired by my attempt at bathing suit buying. NOw, i have always been a one piece gal. First because my mother would freak at a bikini and second because well i don't have the most attractive tummy around. The second thing really bothers me. Do you know how many sit ups i can do? How many bokken strikes i can muster and how long i can withstand two attackers? Well, if you guessed big numbers then you'd be right. But even with my amazing ability to do all those excercises and physical feats i still look soooo ugh. I don't look like a butterball mind you. There is definite muscle everywhere. My upper abs are even getting defined witht hat cool line in the middle that splits them into a lung model, but a las there is that pouch and then the lovehandles which i wouldn't mind if they didn't come with the pouch. Add to that the fact that i am getting a valley. That is when the muscle around the pelvic region actually show up. Again if the pouch wasn't there, they would be attractive in a tough-girl sort of way, but the puch remains so it only adds to me looking so damn bulky. Now the pouch has always been a part of me even when i was a gawky little rugrat (i'll get a picture of me when i was 10 to show you what i mean) so that only bothers me as much as it has always bothered me, what bothers me now are my huge overdeveloped leg muscles. Where did i get them? you might ask, well partially it's a muscular nature, then there was the weight lifting i did in track, then there is the dancing, and then lord knows what. All i know it that i have the calves of a shotput thrower and the tighs of a horse rider. Am i either of those? NO. I've already talked before about my growing consern of my less then well sculped muscular arms and such but those dont bother me as much and i think i've exhausted my complaing about them long ago.  So, with my oddly porportioned body you must have guessed that it was very ahrd for me to find a bathing suite that actually fit me. Well by gosh you are right. Give yourself a pat on the pack because you rule. mOat clothing designers do not, you are above them. They make tops whose bottoms don't fit me, one-pieces that are not generous enough around the breast area and bottoms that begin in odd places ( too high or too low). After trying on 8 different bathing suits, in a variable array of sizes i came upon two tankinis that finally fit me. I was happy. However the bottom of one was much flattering then the bottom of the other, while one top was more flaterring then the top that came with the most flattering bottom. Saddly, this was a no mix and match sort of deal (i actually asked if i could). So i picked the one witht he more flattering top because the other one showed the pouch, but also those nice pelvic muscles. In the end i think i would have liked the one i didn't pick better, were it not for the fact that upon asking myself "do i look like i belong in those weightloss informercial's before photos?" the answer was "yes".  It isn't too bad though. The reason i was even picking out a suit is because i want to get my body to be like one of the after photos, not an unrealistic one of course and not so damn bony.I plan to swim as much as possible as a means to get more cardio in. I could run, but even long distance walking makes my knees act up and i don't want to sacrifice my bones. I figured that swimming was a great way to reshape.   My body is a temple and i really want to remodel it. NOt that what's here isn't good, but if i have the means and will to make it better i don't see why i shouldn't. Even my face is being attacked. argh pimples. I am trying to take care of it though. I am also thinking about just completly changing my hair. Partly i think that college makes me want to change and partially it's the fact that my inner beauty and inner strength are not well represented in this husk. Lets work together body to make the thing that is called Marlen the best that it can be.

      It is simply too hard to make people happy. Why are we so willing to slip in to a state of dissatisfaction and lethargy? Does it make us feel better to simply play victim? Does it make us feel better when no responsability for our own happyness falls on our shoulders? I know very well that most times i jsut want to give up. Give in to those doubting thoughts in my head that tell me to stop and well stop, simply wallow in unhappyness. I'am not convinced that this is the best way to live, although perhaps it is the safest. NO, it's not even that. In fact it is extremely dangerous. Unhappyness is a plague, a sickness, it has no worth. So i say not to stick around to long in that unhappyness. I was dreadfully dissapointed at the fact that i couldn't gather friends. All i wanted was to hang out and show love. But then it's so hard to please everyone. I've decided that i'm really only good at dealing with people on a one on one basis. I can do well in paying attention to one person and making them feel good, but i'm not sure i can do that to many people. Hmmm i suppose i am a true monogamist. Hehe.   I wish i had more time to spend with angie, and a car so that i could spend time with angie and a driver's liscence so that i could use the car to hang with angie oh and a knowledge of non-outdoors really fun places so that i could chill with angie.   I'm the kind of person who gets her fill of love by giving it out more then really getting it, because well i am suspicious when people are giving it. I'm sorry i'm not very good at making you all happy.

      I have failed to gather friends and show them love. I might just go hiking with John. Don't hate me. When you don't get any empanadas just know that empanadas are made with love and so they cost love and you didn't pay the price.

      No i'm not looking for butt. That was a joke. Although i am looking for love, anytype. Give marlen some love people.   Shoes was awfully slow again today. I am running out of clothes that are allowed. Can't say that i live in the dressy stuff they require. IN fact i'm really not sure what pants i can wear tamaree.   Possibly hanging out with the john and the andrew and the angela and the ai-chi, followed by the aikido followed by possible hanging out with the Ronny and the Tony and the Pablo (brother). The later half is interested in going to terrywild really late in order to scare the shit out of ourselves, but i think they're gunning for me...Going out with the younger aiki-crew, there is a first for everything.  On the horrible side, my mom has apperantly been filing her tazes wrong. Instead of filing married the jackass who did her taxes had her as separated or something like that. Needles to say, since the college was doing veryfication on me and that small deatail was off i can't go to college unless my mother files some form to fix the mistake that the asshole made. So with the threat hanging above my head i live on.

      For those of you who are interested in visiting me at the JC Penny shoe department or want to catch me on my lunch break, here is my schedule for the week.  Wednesday 9-5 with lunch at 1-2 Thursday- 12:45- closing (10) with lunch at 4-5  Then I have Friday and Saturday off, who wants to chill with me? Angie?  Here is something that I wrote during some of the awful downtime that we had at the slow as hell shoe department.    “It is possible to believe that we have no purpose. That our life, the time in which we are conscious and unconscious, means nothing. But to think this way is to deny existence, for if our lives are meaningless then existing is meaningless, being is meaningless and what we create or destroy, defile or make holy, know or have no knowledge of is meaningless. Existence cannot be meaningless for it “is.” Therefore what takes part in existence, what exists has meaning, nothing is arbitrary.”  Then there is this.  “It harder to make sense”  Yes the grammatical error stays in tact, I thought it was more profound in the dumb way that I wrote it. Hmm I’m weird. Who gets attacked by philosophical notions in the middle of shoes? I guess it’s me. I’d tell you all about work but I’d rather tell you in a cool calm conversation, makes me sound like I have a life.    And JOhn is not looking for booty calls, i am

      Just came back from orientnation better known to the less sophisticated brutes as orientation. It was cool. I found some smart people who didn't act smart at all which made me happy. Then found some dumb people who couldn’t possibly pull of smart, they might be competent and not dumb but they were prissy little bitches who made fun of other people and that' s as dumb as you get in my opinion. Met a girl from LA who likes to show off her nice rack and fuck her boyfriend a lot. She was nice but i'm not sure i approve pf the way she carries herself. NO wait i am sure. Met a feminist girl, met an anime junkie who will be my roomie, met stupid guys, met extremely smart guys, met kick ass cool as fuck professors whom i already adore, and met a guy who has done and still does kendo for 8 years. I met his friend first, who scoffs at that sort of stuff and hates English and just about anything i like but is really nice and funny. I mentioned aikido he lamented with an "oh jesus" and then talked tiredly about his kendo friend. By some coincidence i was pulled to a random table with people i didn't know and he was standing right next to me and in walks friend. He's half Puerto Rican and half Brazilian, how cool is that? We talked about our weirdness when it comes to martial arts. Twas brief but twas good.  I also met a lot fo spoiled rich brats who i do not care for. They all wear the same freaking skirt, orange tan and lui bag.  I met a bunch of people with boyfriends. Now, i am not an unattractive person, why does no one love me? Oh the derangement...wait they were deranged too. Sigh* must be the complicated philosophy and personality that is marred by mistakes and fears.   My schedule is the best in  he world. It almost didn't happen but the kick arse teachers let me in to their already closed classes. Here is my awesome schedule.  M-R 9:20-10:35 American Lit II M-R 12:10-1:25 Preceptorial:search for good life M-R-T 1:35-2:50 Japanese M-R 4:25-5:40 Japanese literature T-F 9:20- 10:35Abnoamal psych  Thank god for no Wednesday, it means i can come back to lil' Danbury and do aikido. Friday classes end really early too...now all i need is a ride. Speaking of aikido, my awesome buddy Ronnie got tested. It was so beautiful. Everything he did was so graceful and controlled and so powerful. The moment he sat in seize to bow to our Senseis’' his power radiated. It was true aikido and he made me so proud. He and i are the only ones left from when we first started in a youth center. I think i'll marry him someday if Jack decides he wants the status quo. HMmmm maybe they'll have to duke it out for me, but that would be stupid and un-aikido like. Anyway, I’m just making jokes here. Obviously, if i married Ronnie it would be to get him his citizenship haha. When you have such intimate knowledge about a person's movement and body like we do it's impossible to have anything else and impossible not to be confused sometimes. Do aikido or even any sort of physical activity with someone long enough and you become very comfortable and trusting, even if no real in depth talking has occurred. Nothing like the language of the body to draw people closer.   OH and when i went to college there was a lot of discussion about sex. i am a firm believer in the sanctity of the body. Sex is sacred and it should not be cheapened, but man i seem to be the only one who thinks so. Everyone else either thinks it should be shared with everyone or they think it's evil. I must say that it's kind of annoying that no one else has the more complex feelings that i do. Well everyone else except for the cool people minus John, who is asking for booty calls.

      i really don't like leaving those little sad post on top, so freakign depressing. Actually i dont' think the last post was depressing just pensive. But waht do i know i haven't read it in like a week.   Anyway, FUN FUN. Angie and i made a delicious Dunch (lunch and dinner). It consisted of oven roasted chicken (cooked by me), moro (mumsy), and yumm yummy chocolate cake filled with blueberry pie filling (angie). The whole Dunch was a hit and we eate outside. It took like 3 hours to make it and i think jsut as long to eat it. My brothers fully approved of the cooking and made happy faces. I think they were more enamoured with angie's cake. We don't eat cake or really nay desserts a lot so i can see why. They thought it was delicious. Wooooh. Angie and i must learn to cook faster. We'll need it for when we have our apartment. I mean,w ho ahs three hours to cook? Not career women, that's for sure. The day was fun fun fun fun fun.  I also had aikido today, fun fun fun! Again i loved the higher belt class. So much flipping and dangerousness and the new techniques. Man i love this. I am so glad that i bother my sensei to no end. Without me, were would he get his criticism...although it's probably really wrong that i do that...Eh i get special priveledges, we're friends like that. MUahahahah. I believe i did something to my shoulder again but it'll be ok. I didn't realize how much i knew until i saw the other higher belts not understanding some movements. Very odd. Even still, a lot of them have picked up some movements much faster the i ever di at their grade. OY i am not a very good aikidoka, but i try. I suppose i have more heart then anything else. But i do have SOME skill. I'd ahve to ahve picked up something from devoting my life to this. Angela made me realize that i actually spend more days in aikido then out of aikido. I didn't really notice it before. I like it. Aiki makes me happy. I am so going to be screwed during college -_-

      He said my attitude was changing. That he didn't know wether it was good or bad exactly, but that there was something missing in me. He said that the manner in which i asked for new knowledge was akin to challenging, that i was restless basically. I think he's right, there is something missing, and yes i am at a rush to learn. I fear that i will be able to do nothing while at college, that the thing that keeps my psyche stable, the thing that keeps me secure will slip away from me, and i will become a shadow again. Fear and desire seem to be polluting my training. I have become untrusting, rough, and controlling. That's not very taoist of me.   I know what's different, at least i think i know. I used to see my training as a means for personal growth, that it didn't matter how long it took so long as i was always reaching for what was just a little beyond the now, so long as i was trying to be better. Now after receiving this brown belt i feel this great urge to know everything to reach something in fast speeding train, to force my way through, but that only leads to being tired. I feel the need to prove to myself that i deserve to be where i'm at. Correction, it's not just me it's to everyone. I feel the need to explain all the training that i have done, and i feel the need to force the fast track that i ahve been on, which was only so because of my slow and tempered attitude that only seeked to progress. I fear that i am rushing to end, almost liek i feel this great need to "finish" training before i do anything else with my life. I must be insane, it never stops, it never finishes, it never rushes, it is never slow, it always is as long as i let it be. I have forgotten my way.   He asked "what's wrong?" He figures that something must be wrong for my "attitude to be changing." I say nothing. But, there are a lot of things i just can't talk to him about it. And so i've fallen in to this trap of fear and desire, i have stopped accepting and started to fight. That is the attitude change, i have begun to fight. I think that this is somehow connected to the visions of bones and death. I both fear and lust over my own force. I want to learn how to destroy as much as i want to learn how to not destroy. I ask for new techniques, new teachings, but where is my foundation for these new teachings? Any of the knew tech. that he's shown me i've done with little struggle. He's noticed now, that my skills for techniques are too far ahead of my mental capabilities. I hurt people more often now. I apply more pressure, again perhaps it is part of proving myself, of seeing my own power, but all it shows is my mental weakness and my declining compassion. What is all this for if i care more for power and less for compassion? I am disgusted with myself. I think that this is a challenge that every martial artist or even anyone who is attaining some powerful knowledge or influence is faced with. When we hunger for more of what we have, we are rushing to meet an end, when we pace ourselves with progress, never forgetting compassion and selflessness, the journey is limitless.   It is time that i stop being someone else, someone much stronger and yet much weaker then muyself. I dont' want to hurt anyone and i don't want to learn what i cannot teach myself until i have accepted my weakness as part of progress. Hmm event hat's not right, that still sound slike weaknesses are bad. They are just part of us and i must stop fighting with mine. I must stop fighting with everything really...

      &nbsp;Turns out that people think i'm not fat and think i'm&nbsp;attractive, except not really attractive just midly attractive; enough not to cause disgust thus rendering me not ugly enough to joke about...at least not when it comes to looks. But there is a girl who works with me who apperantly has what it takes to be made fun of by the guys there. I don't like it very much, that they talk about her. I think that they beleive i'll get some sort fo satisfaction or that somehow i'm being complimented by mentioning someone else's unattractiveness. Well i'm not complimented.&nbsp;Today was aikido and work, nothing new. I went to see Jeffy at his work and pretty much bothered him on his lunch break. His mother cooks very yummy food. I hauled him to Build a Bear to find a friend and didn't find her but i found a really really really cute bunny, if&nbsp;you want to get it for me with a Gi outfit feel free, i'll love you if&nbsp;you do.   Speaking of love i'm such an ass when it comes to that stuff. Going back to the girl that the guys make fun of, they call her unattractive, and even attack her personality, but guess what? She has a boyfriend, so it got me thinking. I think i know why men don't want to go out with me or are afraid to ask me or whatever, i think it's because i give off "i can kick your ass and you're not a necessity vibes." OH and the violence...and the irrevocable wall that i put up against any sort of physical contact whatsoever even if it's a handshake. But i'm&nbsp; letting that go. Yay me. This expirience of witnessing boys as they asses girls who aren't "hott" has shown me that they do grade women in accoradance to the standardized supermodel (they like blonds a lot), but that in the end&nbsp; guys embrace the real girls, otherwise the girl that they're talking about wouldn't be in a long lasting relationship like she is.  I must make a list for college, i have no idea what it is that i need. This is horrible. And mother talks of getting the laptop after i've already entered school, that's extremely annoying considering that i'll have to figure out how to set up my kick ass printer to the laptop. Hurray kick ass printer. I realize that i don't nearly have enough clothes...what's up with that? Most of my clothes are atheletic pants and stuff that i wear around the house, like oversized shirts and tight tanktops. Man i really need help with this college list -_-. Everyone else seems to be set ont heir preperations except me. *sigh. Oh well, i'm slow and confused, nothing wrong with that...

      No aikido today because I don't have a ride and it's raining so I can't possibly convince mother (or myself for that matter) that walking out into the pouring rain to walk 3 miles to the dojo is rational or safe or a whole other bunch of caution words. I'm still hoping that at some point past seven some lovely aikidoka will pick me up out of love for me. Unlikely to happen, specially considering the rain.   Suffering is not having aikido, but I'm going to do my best to make it count. I think I'll make a list on what I need for college supplies, then perhaps do so esoteric research, then play something, wash my hair, and read  The Sound of Waves  a book that Jack lent to me and I haven't gotten to read much of it. Funny thing is that Yukio Mishima, the author of said novel, was born on Jack's birthday and committed Seppuku on my birthday....Which by then wasn't our birthdays because we weren't' born so it's more like JAck was born on his birthday and I was born on the day of his death. We should make prophecies out of this sort of weird thing, any are welcomed, come on, get creative!   Speaking of Jack he completed the&nbsp;tetrad of happiness that I experienced today before the single crushing sorrow. First was lovely Angie giving me an excuse to take my lunch early and then bask in her glory. That's always good. Second was the cutest site of a preppie boy with his arms around the cutest little punk wannabe girl with more dark&nbsp;eye makeup then I have ever encountered in my life, btw I was on dance team, I have seen A LOT of makeup. They couldn't have been more then 11 or 12 but their innocent love that crossed cliche boundaries made me smile. Third in the tetrad was an Asian mommy and her little bouncing toddler girl going "Wanta get foo foo now? We eat eat?" The interchange of silly syllables of adoration where enough to have me content and reaffirming my belief that life is worth something. Then there was precious Jack who promised to visit me and then did. He had cheap clothes form the gap and old navy that I wished to steal but couldn't. He has the best shirts...I took a 15 for the first time since I&nbsp;have worked at JC Penny and he bought me a dunkachino of goodness, also my first. Happiness ensued as well as jealousy, but the caffeine left little room to be unhappy.   It is probably this tetrad of happiness that has kept me from crying rivers over a lost aikido class. Life may be suffering, but I think we can make up for it.

        &nbsp;So i've been contemplating life and how much of it is suffering. If life is in deed suffering then living is about making the suffering (life) count. I'll expand later, for now lets recap the week . Hmm this thing isn't letting me make new paragraphs. Anway i cut of my hair, it's adorable. Though i still don't have the hang of making it all nice and&nbsp;straight.&nbsp;HUng out with the&nbsp;Angie and the Matt. I will miss Matt terribly on his journey across the pond. Seems such a shame to hand over such a brilliant revolutionary int he making to the Brits, like they'll ever change...Empanadas! i ate so many it's delicious. mother loves andrtew so she gave him a lot. And i adore Jack but he was away and i couldn't give him any. I was going to go to his job and make him eat them but since he's walking his pants off somewhere in tenesse i jsut dropped them of home with his brother. I hope he can get them when he returns.&nbsp;Anyway work and aikido of course where a part of life.&nbsp;On saturday i got tortured by the wonderful and utterly damnable Ronny and&nbsp;the MAN otherwise known as sensei. It hurt like hell. After 4 hours of beutiful torture i went off to work with my hair a mess. I&nbsp;was dizzy&nbsp;and couldn't do much of anything. My head was pounding and i wanted to puke.&nbsp;The guys were nice though and let me take a&nbsp;small nap&nbsp;in the back room. I'm glad i survived that. However&nbsp;i still have an awesome bruise on my tricep.&nbsp;I'm not sure wether&nbsp;Sensei or Ronny did it. Fucking bastards, i love them.&nbsp;Keep it lighthearted, i'm out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I thought I'd give this thing a funny title, make it'll take the edge of off my solemn feelings that will pour out. I am truly truly sad. For the first time in a couple of months I am honestly and wholly sad. My friend, part of my square of confidentiality, is leaving me. He is leaving all of us, but me and my abandonment issues makes me feel like I'm being left. I am so a lone. No that's not right, I have a lot of friends. Yesterday we had a surprise party for the lovely man we call Matt or Matthew in my case. It was grand, and there where a lot of lovely people there, a lot of people that I have immense affection for. Lovely Jeffy gave me a great and long back massage, he's so playful and kind. Erik tried, but mostly he made sexual references and tried to get under my shirt in jest, he is an amazing person with a childlike facade that hides his intelligence and convictions. Andrew gave me plenty of hugs, he's a passionate guy, and I thank him for his hugs, I really needed them. Angela was there, there is no one outside of my family that I would do more for . Jack was there, he gave me a ride, he is a good person although he'll eventually break from that once he gets tired of me being around him so much. He caused some sadness in me by showing me what an illusive weakhearted person I am. But nothing caused me more sadness then to have to say good-bye to my dear friend Matthew. We walked around the yard and talked a lot. I wish I would have done that more often with him. I wish him all the happiness in the world, I really do, because he certainly deserves it, but mostly because I love him. I am not alone, but I am very lonely right now. I haven't felt this way in a while. Please, let it go away.  I am not much of anything. I need a knew expensive ink cartridge. My mother practically called me a whore for coming home late from sending my friend off. I cried a lot, because of her insults and because of Jack and especially Matt. Maybe Aikido will make me feel better, but it is I who has to teach today. I don't think I can do it very well... My hair is curly, Jeff complimented it among other people, thank you for making me feel less ugly. I don't feel ugly, just ugly inside. My physical appearance means nothing when I can't even be at peace with myself. I need affection. Not the surface frivolous kind. I need someone to hold me and tell me that life is beautiful and that we all find our ways. I'm becoming so weak. To think I'd ever admit to needing someone to hold. I'm going to teach class now, I hope it makes things better. I want to tell you to leave me alone, so please, don't leave me alone.   I am back from teaching aikido. Before class i cleaned as per usual, then i meditated. At first it was very hard for me to get my mind cleared, but once i did i felt much better. In my nothingness i was whole and i was content with myself and the situations around me.  I was again filled with my optimism and my love for life, including all of it's complications. However, in an odd twist, when i stoped meditating and began to stretch i was overcome with a feeling of  grief. I yelled out involuntarily and proceeded to feel stupid because of it. But the wisdom that and calm that had been given to me by meditation stayed with me. YOu see what meditation teaches me is not much different from aikido or the teachings of taoism. You must yield in order to win. My yell was yielding to my sadness in that yell and being at peace with it as well as the situations currently floating about me. I remember that when i was all but an enlightened buddhist i felt that peace with everything, but i still felt unloved. Loved by everything and loving everything, i was nothing special, this is the desire and vanity,  it was my sin of wanting to be something wonderful to someone that kept be from truly being enlightened. I now see that this is my weakness. I've known this somewhere inside of me and thats why i've been so against any sort of need for contact. Reaction formation, Freud would say.  I cannot truly find peace within myself until i have experienced this, until i feel that the value of beign  adored is not so high as the value of being accepted.       Fuck i'm going crazy. What kind of fuckign teenager am i? Fuck. I gotta go to work...

      There comes a time where thinking too much is not enough and where feeling too much is not enough. It is the borderline effect, a moment in time, a fraction of life that is indescribable but holds so much meaning that it is perfectly imprinted in your being, not just in the metaphorical or emotional sense, but literally it is imprinted in your very fiber. Your energy has changed drastically because of it, not necessarily making it deviate from its already chosen path, but rather it may accelerate the way on that path. These very moments are when we are weakest, like the soft shell crab waiting patiently and in suspense for it’s new shell to become strong. It is a time when we push overload and create space, room for more to be taken on without causing a breakdown of the very fragile system. This is a time to choose paths and to evaluate what suffering, what life you are choosing, and wether what you wish for is worth that suffering, wether it is valuable. Is it worth suffering and devoting yourself to it? You must ask the question and you must think it through. It is not wrong to choose to be drastic and not play it safe, it is not wrong to choose the headstrong way, nor is it wrong to choose the passive and accepting way. Each one will come with some sort of suffering, but which one is more worth it? This moment does not become a question of want or need, it is a question of your life, of our entirety, what will you regret? What will you cherish? What is worth suffering for? What is worth in general? These are the questions that will flood you and you may choose to ignore them, and like every decision in your life, it will cause suffering. At this point in time, is it more valuable that they be ignored? You will have to choose something. Answer the questions and be at peace with your decision.

      Let us examine the importance of letting people know how much&nbsp;you care about them.&nbsp;Being affectionate is essential towards the building&nbsp;of character, compassion, morals, and strength. It is when we show our praise and adoration that we find the weakness and exposure needed to make one emotionally strong.&nbsp;Also, when we express caring, we are&nbsp;practicing a form of alturism which builds both compassion and morals. The aturism combined with the exposed weakness creates a person that is more sure in themselves and far less self serving. They love without needing to be loved back in order to appriciate the feeling, they care immensly but not foolishly, they know the difference between when love is a right and when it is a priviledge, they understand that one both needs to protect and be protected, that in a human being there is strength and weakness and that the line between these two poles&nbsp;is not so definite, and that&nbsp;for the post part, they are fully interchangeable. Care for one and other and show it, if not for the wonders it does to your being, then for that funny&nbsp;fuzzy feeling you get in your stomach. Much better then the one you get from Acid.

      The title rhymes too much for me not to use it. Well, today was fun with JOhn, the artist formerly known and still known as JAck. The gent showed expectedly unexpectedly unannounced and fun ensued after I kicked him or attempted to. We went to borders where I didn't get nearly enough of the books that I need for college. It turns out I'll have to order them...*sigh. Everything costs so much > Awakening  by KAte Chopin that was 5 bucks. Anyway, this time around everything was worth it. I'm sure next time around I'll be disappointed somehow.  After fun at borders, fun at bothering JAck's parent's went underway and I made his mother feel guilty over the eaten empanadas. Then food fun, park fun, swing fun, playing guitar fun, ice cream fun,&nbsp;talking fun, planning out life fun, thinking fun, school fun, driving fun,&nbsp;sex fun; all the different flavors of fun except the last one because that's a lie. Sha, like I'd ever announce something like that online.   We saw tons of parental units with their kids. I was particularly touched by the ones with only a male rent with him or her. Man, my dad never did that. If I should have a kid I really want her to have all the love of both parents, it really sucks when one isn't there. No matter how much they may actually love you and suffering for you, it cannot be conveyed while away and being disinterested while being there. Anyway, if I ever plan to get married chances are it would be to have a kid and raise the hell out of it with sheer unapologetic love and cuddle wars...And aikido. So obviously I would have to be married to someone who would support my system and add his own supercool, attractive, compassionate thing that made me marry&nbsp;him in the first place.   But first I have to date, break up, go to Japan with, and date John so that we can get married and procreate a child after years of success and financial stability as well as critiquing each other's work harshly. Ha, sounds like a good life. Um some thoughts, nature is good except for a bug as it's biting you, I love swings, being around good people is good for your Jerry (don't worry you can't understand this), it's perfectly fine to disagree as long as one is in agreement when it comes to acceptance and compassion, we do slightly&nbsp;mean things because we want attention from someone we care (after all it does seem like we tend to pay attention to the bad rather then the&nbsp;good) and cuteness is really valued in Japan. Oh and I can't really park to the right.&nbsp;Stay cool.&nbsp;

      This is my 100th post in the 2 and some odd years that i've had this little web journal. That doesn't say much for my updating. Now that it's summer i do it almost everyday. It probably jumped from 50 to 100 just from july. Anyway, i thought i should try and make it really good, but remembered that most of my really good posts are only good to people of a philosophical mind or just me...plus they tend to be inspired. So here i am with a lack of inspiration just ready to talk about my day. The day was like any other day, involving work and aikido. Actually the bank was definetly in there. What iv'e found from having a job is that i really like to save and have my own money, and buy practical things. As i went in to deposit my check in that lovely savings account of mine which has been getting plumper as time goes by, i mused over Japan. To me, a savings account, money, is only as valuable as what it is used for. Money has great values if it sends me to japan. However, i am worried that if the college sees my savings account they wont give me as much money and make me use said savings account to pay for tuition, leaving me...japanless. I might want to just get a little safebox and keep my money there. My goal is to have saved up 7 thousand by the time junior years rolls around. I think that might be too high a goal in reality, but i'm not sure...Anway, Japan. What i really love about paying for my stuff is that i have things to show for my work. I get the quality that i want and i never feel guilty if it happens to be a bit expensive. I get what i know is right for me, so suddenly i don't have junk i have useful tools. It's more like comfy pillows and cute lamps and an awesome hairdryer but hey they work for me. I love the practicality of everything i buy! I splurge on practical items, but i really don't like to spend a lot of money on clothes. Clothes are rediculously overpriced and lacking in any creativity what-so-ever. I will not buy a little polo shirt for 25 bucks, it's just not gonna happen. I'm not going to spend the money that's earned from working around 3 hours just so that i can look like everyone else. Looking like everyone else for $12 or less is ok. Although it's 12 for practicality. There are few shirts that wont give you a rash that's more then $3 less then that. Unless they're on clearence of course. Well on to the day...after banck came =Aikido. My shoulders and my back hurt, nothing is new. Oh except all those really advanced and horrible bone crushing techniques that we praticed today. I only get to do those when Ronny is there...i wish he was there more often...the bastard. After Aikido was home to wash the stench and filth from my body. Then came work. At work, a coworker flirted with me endlessly and called me a "cutey" past annoyance levels. This has nothing to do with me being special, he just likes girls...he likes girls a lot. Apperantly he thinks i'm adorable and cute. I'm not hott though...i wonder if i want to be hott? I'm not sure how much guys like cute. They probably like it as much as they like their little sister. Work was a bit hectic although nyron made a stop, promised something that he wasn't going to deliver and didn't buy any shoes. Hahaha. Work was hectic and we stayed around 25 minutes extra. On a seperate note, i never liked the apostles too much, in particular Peter and Paul. Paul wasn't even there, he's just some crazy guy hell bent on having power. Peter was kind of an ass and seriously lacking in faith, i mean he was an apostle and denied three times. Then he gets all high and mighty and is all "oooh i am the first leader of the church." Man Peter is probably mad at me now...or reincarnaded as a woman so that he can work out some of his machismo. The man was quite rude and jelous of Mary Magdalene, who had her own little christian group that eventually died out and where silenced since Peter's followers decided that she shouldn't be given any credit and that her gospel just wasn't cool enough for the "all boys club." I have this feeling that most religions if not all have a very definite female energy and contribution that eventually gets twisted and eventually wiped out so that people can be controlled more easly. Man i should become a prophet or a teacher of a religion and make sure that i get the credit for it. I'm seriously considering this. I'm a fan of theology as well as a bit of a scholar in it. Plus i have natural leadership skills lol. Although i'm not how serious they'll take the "cute little girl" who teaches on existance.

      I don't know why, but i can't sleep. Normally it wouldn't be a problem, but since i have work tomorrow at the lovely hour of 9am it's a very big problem. I'm always so tired when i leave from work. It' s not like it's a lot of physical activity. We have to go up and down the stockroom stairs but that's really nothing at all compared to Aikido training. Yet, everytime i get out of Aikido training i feel pretty lively, filled with battery acid and a lovely glow of energy. Work is just emotionally exhausting and disruptive to my energy. I am so glad that next week is my last one. I think that they decided to make my last week hell. I have the worst schedule that one could ever dream of. Monday will go as follows 9-5:30 work, straight to aikido from there. Wednesday will ahve a similar fate. Tuesday work starts at 1pm and ends at 9:45, which usually ends up being 10. We have discussed Wednesday. Thursday is the same 9-5 deal. *sigh friday is a day of rest. I'll probably sleep the whole way through until Aikido class. Then saturday is Morning Aikido and work right after it. They scheduled me at 1 but hey i need a shower so i'm going in at 3 or so. MUahahah. At least after that Saturday i am free to fun out. People must make plans with me. I'd completly be up to calling people if it weren't for the grave fact that i don't drive. Not driving sucks. This thing isn't letting me make paragraphs *sigh. On a happy lovely note angie has been expiriencing manhattan. YAY. She is funning out herself.Woooo three cheers! I hope someday we make enough money to afford living there in a comfortable non-cocoroach infested fashion. But first we have to get through college. I'm craving for it's freedom. I just want to go on a roof top at 1am and gaze at the stars. I think i'm not sleeping because i'm thinking too much. Latetly i've been feeling the weight of responsibility and expectations. For example my Sensei scolded me without scolding me about having wanted to go to Ai-chi's graduation instead of class. He talked about how Aikido was a sacrifice and that you had to give up a lot of things including friends...I hate to break it to him, but while aikido will always remain a part of me i don't plan on making any money off of being a sensei. My goals are directed at being a succesful writer/psychologist. Most distrubing was when he said that succeeding sometimes meant forgetting even your family. At this point i sorely disagreed with him. Anyway, he called it some sort of test to confuse me. All i see is clarity. His beliefs are not mine. His sensei, who has done more for the art of aikido ( not in making it popular but evolving it) then most modern aikidokas was very much pre-occupied with become a Doctor to constantly train. Even so, the art never escaped him and he has become an awesome (in the truest sense of the word) Sensei. I think i have found some peace with my having to train less in the dojo because of college. I believe that i don't need to rush, i don't even need to train everyday. Aikido is always with me, constantly but not agressively showing me a truth, teaching me lessons. I don't need to rush, because it's always there. There is nothing to rush to. I problem with my Sensei and i is that i lean more towards his Sensei's way, which concentrates on spirituality and philosophy, making techniques only the manifestations and movements of the abstract concept that is Aikido. While my Sensei also notices the peaceful and calming benefits he is of the more physical and mental, all but renouncing the spiritual. He has had some arguments with his Sensei about this. All i can say is that i am finding my own way, which is what i'm suppose to. Aikido in no way is like other martial arts where blind leadership is required. I ask myself "is this what i want?" The answer is yes, Sensei, but it is my "do" not yours. I will never train in Aikido for anyone but myself.

      There is a certain class of people whom i will call "avid promisers" that inspire such a tangle of emotions in me. I'm pretty set on having to pay for everything that will come with the next stage of my life. NO one will buy me a car, no one will pay for college, no one will pay for the forms to become a citizen, no one will help me with my driver's liscence and no one will send me to Japan. I have to do all these things myself and while i admit, i wish it were easier, i fully accept that it isn't. This is where avid promisers really tick me. They promise to help with this or to give that, but all they're really doing is beging for worship, beging to be asked for help and to have some sort of protective claim over a person. "Oh i helped you with this, i'm a really good guy." What's worse is that sometimes i believe them adn fall in to the dilemma that many of us face, i call it the "cinderella syndrome." We all think that one day someone is going to help us, take us away from our burderns, ease our loads, be dependable. The key word is "dependable." Few people are really dependable, and when you fall prey to an avid promiser you are falling prey to the destruction of your dreams. The truth is that we must all believe that we have to do it ourselves, or atleast i have to. The moment i start to believe that there is help is the moment i risk not completing the task myself, the moment i risk taking it easy and depending. It's also why i hate waiting for someone. I always get the feeling that they'll never come for me, that i'm a lone. That's why i don't like people forgetting me. When i was a kid my mother only saw me on sundays, she would leave me the whole week in this random shack in the country somewhere to be taken care off because dad was nowhere to be found and mum had to work to support us and buy us the medicine that we needed. Every week i was left with the feeling that she would never come back, but she always came back, which is why i only really trust my mother to love me and remember me. I question everyone else's even my father's dedication or especially his. I'm really most comfortable when alone. I feel closer to nature or to something beyond when i'm by myself. Today i walked by myself  to the library after some rescheduling was made known to me. I mused on how beautiful the day was and how peaceful i felt, even among the horns of the cars and the engines grunting. I didn't feel stupid or foolish and i didnt feel the need to make a sarcastic comment, and i didn't have to think about wether the person next to me understood me. I yearned and desired nothing, i just walked and i was happy. The wind, the sun, and my trip to the library could not disappoint me, it wouldn't forget me, it wouldn't need to apologize and i didn't feel the need to try and let it know me so that it could maybe care about me. I didn't feel stupid because i thought it was beautiful and because i didn't fear it would take away some happyness. I like being alone, and yet i can't really be without people. I just wish i'd find more people who didn't make me feel so out of place, so forgettable. I think i just hate yearning for their affection.

      Not much to report on this front. Perhaps some philosophical musings? Nah Angela once again made me wish i were gay or bi when she said the perfect thing to a comment that was half self-defeating. My love for you knows no boundaries....Except for those of heterosexual. Speaking of heteosexuality, i think I'm screwed. The chances of me falling in love are pretty narrow as are the chances of me going against my philosophy that sex is to be enjoyed and cherished in love. We can all do the math and see that this translates to me coming out like a real prude. Awesome. I could pass for a Christian...No wait they have tons of sex. Moral codes concerning sex are only applicable to Jehova's Witnesses and Amish people as far as Christianity is concerned. Taoism is all about it being an expression of love, Confucianism sees it as duty, and i think the Buddhists are with the taoists on this one. I'm not sure about the Hindus and we all know the Tantra Yogis are all about it. Muslim is probably the same as Christianity; few sects actually enforce the sexual rules. I wonder who made up these rules anyway. When did we go beyond animal instincts and seek out love and attachment and even God in some cases, while we also seeked to deny it's very existence and call it shameful? It just goes to show that perspectives can do a lot for a bodily function, or a two body function actually. Oh wait, there's masturbation. It' s a sin in the old testament. I'm wondering if that's because the old guys writing it thought that sperm was sacred or because they wanted their men uber sexually frustrated so that they would want to get married sooner and properly exercise their male domination over their wives as well as be so jammed with testosterone that they'd go to war with less convincing involved. It could have had multiple reasons and motivations. Like my reasons for going to Ai-chi's graduation. One, i want to see Chi chi and commence the fun that we will have, two i want a reason to do something, and three i really hate work. I'm wondering if i should tell my parents and my brother will probably be really pissed off and tell on me at work. I hope they know I'm quitting, cuz i am, even if they don't know. August 15th i stop working no matter what, i just don't show up. Other setbacks include how disappointed my sensei will be when he hears i'm not coming on Friday and how much he'll scold me even though i have the best record of attendance then any of his students. Hell, the time i spent there last summer is enough so that if i didn't go for 30 to 40 classes I'd still have the most classes under my belt. Even so...i do hate missing class. But then there is Chi chi! I haven't' done a lot of things with friends because aikido takes a lot of my time up and as a Sagittarius (sp?) and especially as a Marlen i simply desire such an adventure. We'll see what happens. This smells of doom because it sounds like too much fun, I'm not allowed to much fun...I'm not kidding, my mom has actually said this. "don't you think you're having too much fun over there? i think it's best you leave" or "you can't do two fun things in a day that's just over doing it." I'm wondering if she sees it as a condition with horrible side effects. Boy i cant wait for college. Even my mother's food isn't delicious enough to have me not desire my independence.

      Oh man I was re-reading the blogs from the other days, man I sound so pathetic. I get in to the weirdest moods sometimes I swear. That whole needing someone to hold me thing is just...Really not right. Doesn't even make sense. I'm under the impression that I'm only lonely around people. The less contact I have with them, the less likely I am to feel lonely. C'ept for Angela, she inspires nothing but warm fuzzy feelings...Of doom. Seriously, someone must have gotten something wrong when he/she/it/them/stuff made us so damn heterosexual. Couldn't we at least go both ways? Noooooooooooo we're so straight edge its appalling in this age of open-minded sexuality. Oh well, at least more creative sexual activities are known today, no fate of only missionary style sex for us....hahaha.  Dude I need to watch Sex in the City show, Angela likes it, and she's Asian, she has way higher standards.  I think I'm starting to remember why I've had such a strong hate of maleness, not that I'm reverting to it mind you. I think that there are lovely guys out there, but none that I wont judge harshly and horribly so as to make it really hard for them. Sorry about that. It's really more self destructive anyway, just means that I'm not likely to have many lovers(if any) but I'll always have plenty of guy friends. I care about the ones I have a ton.  Back to the maleness hating, it's really not all males, but I've seen this only in males, they tend to disrespect me. Nothing ticks me off more then someone showing me disrespect. A guy can be a clutz or emotionally retarded, or even lacking in dependability, these things I can forgive as "work in progress," but the moment he does something stupid like grab something he shouldn't, order me and not ask me politely, swear or call me names ( such as"bitch, slut, trick", in counts in jest if they do it after being warned), or ignore me/pretend to listen, or put words in my mouth and patronize me, I deem him as scum and it really makes me want to hurt him. I'm not talking about my little punches, I'm talking about wanting to hurt every single aspect of his being. I know it's horrible, terribly lacking in compassion. Needless to say, that's my button. I'm guessing I'll have to work that out throughout the entirety of my life. Good thing Aikido teaches compassion and patience, because I sure need a lot of it when encountered with these types of guys. There are about 3 of them where I work. (Channels patience)  Meditation is good. I think I'll try to push it back in to my life a lot more. I've been really busy and lazy at the same time. I'll try to do it every other day for at least 15 minutes. I know, it sounds pathetic, specially after my everyday half hour that I used to do. But, you have eto start and restart somewhere. Anyway I think that anymore is too much for me. It's sort of like a drug to me, calms me down and heals me, but I also feel strangely disconnected and I tend to see things. For example, I've been seeing the faces of people who I want to see, specially at my job. I would see them in the mirrors or walking by, and really vividly, but only for a second. At one point, I seriously thought I saw my parents walking up to me. Is that not strange? Third eye? Or maybe a really fucked up visual shingdig supplied with an over abundance of imagination. I'd like to think it's the third eye telling me something, like "you want to get away."  And I do want to get away. I want to go to Japan junior year. I really really really really do. I've decided that my double major, my ridiculous loans, and my trip to Japan would be worth the suffering. I'm not sure how my life will carry out...Although Ai-chi's mom and my hands seem to know...but i think that these dreams are worth endangering my sanity and murdering my pockets.  I've also decided that it'll be a while before this punching thing goes away. I'm not even sure if it'll ever leave me. I've noticed that I only punch guys, specially the ones I love a lot. My Sensei punched me in my arm today while saying something , he's picked up my habit. Glad i could teach you something Sensei. He even hit semi-hard, just enough for it to hurt, not enough to cause a bruise, just the way it aught to be done. He's a real pro. You can see that I'm gloating about this...I think I'd only not hit a guy if he commanded a really huge amount of honor and always treated me like a goddess. But that man doesn't exist so everyone is screwed. Girls are for the most part safe, although i don't have them as exceptions, i just tend to find more sweet girls then sweet men. I'll try to do it less and channel it somewhere else, I'm sure more meditation will help, but if you're of the lucky (damned) few that have to put up with my aggressive love, sorry but it probably means that deep inside part of me is angry at you for making me like you even with faults that tick me off. Or it could just be me wanting to hit myself but finding that you're the best target around. I haven't really figured out everything about the punches. Be warned, sometimes they really are malicious, specially if I'm laughing and they're really soft, but in your face. Although it could be different...I'm working on the whole "know thyself" advice, but hey I'm 17, I'm a novice, hell my personality probably isn't complete...Or is it ever completed? Man I'm rambling. No one take this too seriously. Don't get me wrong, what I'm writing, i mean seriously, but it's a moment in time, i might think this is really stupid 2 days later. (although no matter whatt i say everything i write is atleast somewhat something i believe in, just expressed imperfectly. I'm not necessarily fickle i just can't express as well as i'd like to)Man i still can't get over that sappy post...Wow it must have been the moon, makes everything so romantic and painful and beautiful in it's sadness...As well as just messing with hormones. Anyway, I'm out. Keep it lighthearted kids.

      I'm not depressed. I"m a little sad, but not depressed. I think that word is way over used. When I'm depressed or was depressed rather, I wanted to kill myself and felt immeasurable pain. I can measure this pain, it's like a 3 on an arbritrary scale. So point one, I'm a little sad over something but it's not like I can't handle it. Depression would be not being able to handle it. Second point, no one did anything mean to me. All people mentioned were lovely, even amber who bit me, over Jeffy's glasses is lovely. Wait she wasn't mentioned... Hmm it's doing that thing where it wont let me make paragraphs again. Darn adware. (paragraph) I think I'm allergic to some bug that dwells in white people places. All of my bites are inflamed...The don't do that when I'm bitten in non-white ville....Weird. (paragraph) Sold over my goal this week and today. man I'm a good sales person. On that note, I really don't like the job, or more like the environment with rude people in it although some are nice, and I do make good money...Yeah I gave my two weeks yesterday, I'm completely free from August 15th on. MUahahhaha. I've decided that I want to be with friends and feel the love, all that good stuff. (paragraph) That Great Wraps place in the mall is great. Don't go to that Street Corner place unless you're an adapt drinker, it's really not worth it at all. Their stuff costs more then in the normal places. (P) full moons are beautiful. A summer of caressing winds and a luminous Luna stimulates my clitoris and my soul. It is wonderful to witness the beauty of nature. I don't think that I could ever live exclusively in a big city. I'll make an exception for Angela though.

      What an interesting day. By that i mean, what a bad day. First was the horrible having to work all day. Work was at 1, but that did not promise me sleep, or the time to do important things like...return my movies to the library...like i didn't just pay a huge fine. I needed to get ready an hour earlier beacuse i don't drive and my big stupid brother wouldn't drive me, so that meant that the bus, which comes every hour was my only choice. So i got ready and walked my way to the bus stop. On said way i encoutnered a vihiecal on the side of the road. As i pass by, the man calls out to me. He asks me where a certain road is and i don't know so i tell him that i wouldn't know. I excuse myself and start to walk away when he stops my action and says "how would you like to make a lot of money?" I am puzzeled by this and say "what do you mean?" He says "well i don't want to get oyu upset, but how would you like to make a lot of money?" I look at him strange and he starts talking about how he's a foreign exchange student, he'll even show me his card! I wondered why he thought such a thing would apease me. I politetly say " no thank you, i'm going of to work now." "I"ll take you there," he replies, "how would you like to make a lot of money." I again keep my positive polite attitude and say "no, i'm not interested based on principle." So i walk away, and he follows on his car. "I'll pay you $500 he yells." "no that's ok" i yell back and his car speeds away from me. Funny thing was that I was so close to saying "yeah I’d love to make a lot of money." Lets just say, thank God I’m smart. The experience left me a bit unnerved and as two young guys where walking back and checking me out until the bus came, I had that paranoid feeling. It was awful. I’m just glad nothing happened. I hope I never see the bitch again. He was an Arab I think. He had those tunics and a square hat. If I disappear, you know what might have happened to me. Haha, Ai-chi was disturbed that he only offered 500, she says that it was cheap. Thanks Ai-chi, nothing like being pinned to a large amount of money to make a girl feel worth something. LOL ON an upside, one of the few males I trust, Jeffy, came to visit me twice ^_^. It brought some happiness to my unhappy day. We lunched and then went to visit Angie. We basically stopped her from working for a good half hour. Her evil manager couldn’t have been too happy, but we were. I coated Jeffy with tomato smelling lotion as retaliation for biting me with the oven mitten-like things. After thoroughly playing with gadgets and just talking to Angie the whole time, I bought a bowl and promptly returned to work. Jeff and I parted ways. Before I declared that we must visit Angie, Jeff was talking about getting me that adorable bunny with the gi outfit that I oh so desire. Apparently, my love for Angie is stronger then my desire for said bunny. But man I was so close to getting that freaking cuddly lovely thing! Note to self: When someone offers to get you what you desire, take it. The thought of having someone want to buy me the bunny was enough to make me feel warm and fuzzy inside...I wonder what actually having the bunny will be like...oh yes, I will have the bunny! I think the day really went up after the awful man and the awful timing of work. I got a lovely e-mail from a girl that liked my writing. She said "Though the main tone throughout this piece was melancholy and muse-like, there was always that thread of hope, friendship, weaved in and out of it. Truly a pleasure to read." She also said that I wrote with clarity and lovely description! Other people have made comments as well, but it really means a lot when it comes from such an eloquent writer. I now have a mini fan club, because there are more then one faithful readers....two to be exact. TWO! You know how big that is? Two whole people love my work and promise to read anything I put out. Ain’t it great? I’m hot enough to be a prostitute and smart enough to write about it instead. HAha

      By an unanimous decision i was declared to be the cutest girl in the shoe department, which doesn't say much for the shoe department. The voting took place yesterday without my presence. I don't know much, but i imagine that the guy who sings songs of my adorable-ness started said conversation since he's obsessed with cuteness and rating. By now you must be wondering why Marlen would spend a blog entry talking about how random people think she's cute. Well, it's more on a certain girl who was being made fun off a couple of entries back. They ( the chums at work) were talking about her unattractiveness and i expressed a distaste for such talk. Now i almost encourage it. She heard one of the guys, not the crazy one, profess that he thought i was the cutest, she then proceeded to say something to the likes of "Egh Marlen?" and make one of those faces that says "well if that's your type...ew." Now i take this both as an offense and as a demonstration of her weakness in character. While i refrained from such comments she got on the guy bandwagon and dared to rate me. Now this would be enough to only feel a bit of betrayal and dissappointment, but it gets worse. She also asks two guys in the shoe department if they wanted her to perform fellatio on them or rather she said "you want a blow job." Being that they think her smelly and ugly, they simply walked away. Remember that this girl had a boyfriend. An uneducated ( she dropped out of school), ugly, smelly, two-faced person i can push back and ignore with some time, however, an uneducated, ugly, smelly, to faced, judgmental, cock sucking, cheating person i can't ignore or forgive without carrying some resentment and disgust for sometime. Not to mention, she steals many people's sales. I'm glad I'm leaving the place. (praragraph) on an up note, Jack visited and brought much happiness. I also got my confirmation on my crazy roommate and we walked all 2 miles to aikido. Then we had a great class with lots of higher belt stuff, no Ronny, i shall be forced to beat him senselessly. I'm pretty tired. Work tomorrow form 1-9:45. Oh, and Nyron broke his promise as usual. The universe is balanced.

      I went to bed yesterday or rather at the beginning of today, having read some texts on Mary Magdalene which then somehow lead to Beliefnet.com. Accordin to that little test thing they have, i'm only about 67% taoist. I'm about 99% unitarian universalist. The description of it is something like this. "beliefs are diverse, some believe in a God, some believe that God is everywhere, some believe in no God or that God is irrelevant." I wonder if everyone get this unitarian thing as their first choice. What i got fromt heir description was "be nice for some reason and believe whatever you want after that." Any considerate person must get this close to the top of their belief-o-matic thing. Anyway i think it's a pretty lame little program. Being so knowing in religion, you'd think that they'd figure out that you cannot define Taoism or the Tao, to try and define it is both untaoist and stupid. Plus, anyone with some knowledge in religion can tell which answer goes with what religion. Even with the crappyness, i'm glad that beliefnet exists, at least it encourages spiritual thought. I was reading the book "Witch Among Us," the memoir of a Witch with some very interesting stories and creepy aquantances. I do recommend that you read it, if just for entertainment. Anyway, towards the end she starts to discuss why certain people have 6th senses and why she and other witches can do what they can do trough ritual and unrational perceptions. She beliefs that it is all part of the right brain, the artistic, intuitive side, that rarely gets used in the modern age. But, there aren't just her beliefs, Psycho-biologistRoger Sperry has come to the same theory while studying the brain and human behavior. He gets his info from his own studies as well as the teachings of a philosophy instructor from Harbor College, Willian Gallagher. He believes that meditation and spiritual practices are what excercises the right brains, much like math excercises or wirtting excercises are good for the left brain. The right brain is then stimulated and more synapses to dromant parts of the brain are stimulated.From thist stimulation comes the development of a sixth sense which may be as subtle as a Doctor spoting an illness without a diagnosis or talking to your dead brother minutes after he died in another country (an expirience that the author claims to have had at a very young age). I for one, am not sure how much validity any of the "research" may have. However, it's intriguing as hell. My mother has expirienced many instances of ESP and Clarvoyance. She has predicted the deaths of family members, seen ghosts when she was young, and even had contact with some higher spiritual essance in the form of a slap. She prayed too hard for an aunt of mine who was her best friend and eerily possesing the same personality, even exact phrases, that i now have. She says that when she had prayed and prayed for near a day (and i remember that this was true, she was locked in her room and bro bros and i where confused, especially about food), ahem, when she prayed for near a day something, some unseen force, smacked her in the forhead and said "I told you, no. accept it." Mom said that she was throwing from her prayer stance when this happened to her. After that, she gave up, came out of her room and showed us love.  Now, mother has way more awesome stories then i do. But i've had some similar expiriences. I've had instances of seeing specters crossing by, i also atral traveled at one point, but i didn't get much farther then outside my house. On my second astral travel gig i was really really scared by a gigantic red doggie demon looking like thing that was extremely confused. He was laying near my brother's bed lazily, i looked at it and froze, it looked at me and looked confused. At the moment i was too frighten to make out exactly why he was confused but i think he was wondering if i could see him or not. After that expirience i've never gone astral traveling again. It takes way too much meditation and i've lost most of the cool little tricks that i could do when i was drugged on it. My mother and I could be delusional, as well as the Author and all her people and the psycho-biologist and philosopher as well as the people who engage in practices of the esoteric. I’m not being facetious, it’s very possible that we’re all wrong. How many times hasn’t a vast majority of people believed in something that was later to be proven false? And I mean hasn’t, it’s much easier to count that way. But that’s faith for you. I for one think this is all very interesting and it will probably enrich life in someway somehow, but mostly I think people should be nice for some reason and believe whatever they want.
