       My father passed away...  First let me tell you a little about my father. Philip A. Doherty was born on April 30, 1957 in Boston. For the first part of his life he grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His family of about 6 kids and a not so great childhood made him the great man that he was. After finishing high school, he went to college, and then went into the army. After a few years as infantry he resigned  His rank as 1st Lieutenant, and decided he would rather fly helicopters instead. He loved flying. He flew whenever he got the chance. He flew a Huey, to be exact a UH-1C Huey "Med Evac" Helicopter of the U.S. Army. After marrying my mom in 1982, he stopped flying as much and joined the reserves. He retired from the army in 1998, to spend more time with the family. He loved running and taking long walks and was a very out going kind of person. He was proud of his Irish Heritage and loved his family. He was a very political kind of guy. He always watched those shows on Sunday morning. He wasn't anything close to being a  politician but he sure loved talking like one.    5 years in the making    These have been a really long 5 years and have been ****ed up. Five days and 1 day ago if you were to ask me, if I had any idea what was going to happen, I would have stared at you like some kind of monster. I was just a kid who took things for granted. I had problems with my father, and always spat in his face whenever he tried to do something I didn't like. I threw tantrums at him. Maybe the fact that I took my anger I had against him. Well whatever it was, it all changed so fast. I was down vacationing in Massachusetts to see my relatives to kick off summer vacation. Now when we took these trips for a couple days, my dad did not like coming, unless it was important that he did so. I was off minding my own business when my mom sounded worried. She had called my dad the day before and he didn't pick up. She called again the next day, throughout the day,  and no one picked up. So we cut our vacation short and went back home to Albany, New York on June 27th. I walked in, my dads wallet, keys, and cell phone and car were all there... accept no dad. We decided to wait about an hour, still no dad. My mom finally decided to call the police. When the police came, an officer told us to go into the other room, and he stayed with us. About a few minutes later I heard a scream... a scream I would never forget. I wasn't in the room but I knew what that scream was. When I saw my mother later, she was covered in tears. She  looked like something had just died inside her. My mom then told me and my sister what had happened. Tears wanted to come out, but I didn't cry. We later found out that he died from one of his main arteries closing up. My mother and him knew he had some heart problems, but no doctor had any idea what was going to happen. It was so unexpected. He was on his daily run and he fell staight to the ground and died in a few seconds. Some near by people tried to help, but the heart attack was so quick and painful that nothing could be done.   The following year after my fatherâ€™s death was really messed up. Loosing a parent or anyone so close, hurts. It is like you don't know how to get out of bed without that person. We decided to move back to Massachusetts to be close to family. While all of my family was very supportive at first, it wasn't long till they drifted away. In part because my dad's part of the family has some kind of ****ed up grudge against my mom. Either way the first year without my dad was probably the worst for me. I acted like a two year, always thinking of me, and not my mother, who evidently had it the worst. The next three years, practically my whole outside family fell apart. My mom doesn't really have anyone to go to. Except on rare days we might see my uncle or what not. Other then that though it has been my family against the world. I tried to forget about my father, but this year I realized that would be a big mistake. My father was a great man and it is damn shame he had to die. So instead of trying to forget about him, I am trying to embrace him. If he was here right now, I would want to be doing the things he would be proud of. Two of those things are joining the army after I get out of college, doing the best of  my ability at school.  So in honor of this great man, I made this   Link   When he died my cousin and sister made a collage of all different pictures and some writings of my father. So I figured I could try and make a version 2 on the computer. I liked the end result.      Philip A. Doherty   April 30, 1957 - June 25, 1999   R.I.P.
