      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noon was full with negative aura around me, or so I felt. Day of which some ouches happened, but also some good things too.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went out to get my water delivery, my right leg hit my desk and ouch it still hurts until now. The servant who delivered the water was a total dick, he complained so loud about me coming out too long. If I didn't hold myself back I'd have confronted that sorry asshole, or even reported him to his boss so he'd get yelled later and better yet if he got fired. But what's the good about doing it, anyway, just small matter to actually be taken too seriously - my loss to do so. Then went to have my brunch, stopped by campus to draw some cash and called Ucheh and guess what, everyone were in Rizou's place - without even telling me. I said that I'd go there, but I canceled my plan considering the distance and the dark cloud over south-western part of Jakarta. Went back to my place, got a call from LB saying to need an illustrator on five and I said yes. Used the time to rest, on some minutes before four I left the house and went to have my late lunch. Stopped by campus again, met Ucheh and Muts for awhile. A bit joke that time was when Muts asked Ucheh why he smoked green (green marlboro, the one with menthol) whereas he usually smoked the red one. Before Ucheh said anything, I replied "He smokes it so he can go on coz it's green. If it's red, then he has to stop." Ahahaha, somehow of all the things I said or do, all this time in campus, Ucheh is the one to laugh the most. Hahaha.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then left to LB. Muts said to be careful of rain, I said why worry, it won't rain until way later. On my way ... I changed my mind. The dark cloud had already reached the area, I had to speed up to avoid rain. Dang, the road was jammed in Tomang and the second ouch, my left leg was rammed by a bike behind me. Duh ... are you f*ckin' blind? Again ... just small matter. I couldn't really speed too much coz practically ... my bike had no brake. My main brake needs to be re-adjusted or might even need to be replaced, it won't hold almost at all, hahaha, so dangerous. I took longer route via Monas to avoid the jam but then ... rain started to fall when I stopped at the Harmoni intersection - big drops of rain! Speed up more as soon as the light turned green, and so was the rain ... got more dense the closer I was to LB. Damn, it was only about one more kilometres! And so yea, I arrived in LB, wet through. I felt like I was going to be a total jerk, with my pants totally wet. I stepped upstair and met Rannie, the one who was gonna use my service, and things went way better than I thought. The job wasn't so hard, just to draw woman from the T-Sel picture but now she wears the BCA uniform. And the room wasn't so hostile altho I chilled everytime my wet clothing touched my skin *brrrr*. The people were having good time laughing on some ... pics or probably video of them going to Puncak the last weekend (I heard it from Bonz) while I finished the pic. Had it approved, then I had to scan it - Bonz used the chance to hook me up with the GD he was talking about ... gosh, Bonz, stop that smirk already *lol*. She's a friendly girl, even introduced herself first when we were waiting for someone who were still using the scanner. Didn't talk much, though, and Bonz blamed me about that ^^. Said I didn't use the chance he had made, hahaha, sorry dude! Finished coloring the pic, signed the form, then left. Went back without wearing my jacket ... mmm, it wasn't so bad. Just a bit cold on my way. The road near Roxy was crowded, as usual on that hour. Stopped to have my dinner at Haji's, then went back to my place.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about Gangster Chef being too matured in term of story. Not for adult, but not too sweet-go-love for teen readers either. Still in range for series like J/K/T dramas, though, I think. But guess I'll just put that aside for now. Still confused of how to give life to Harri. What's his zodiac sign, who's his parents, why did he want to become the chef king, how is his daily attitude, yadda yadda. And also to the girl, whom I haven't decided the name yet, and to all other characters. Maybe I'd overdo it to think much details, but I want my characters, and my story, to be so alive, as real as possible. Or should not? Hemmm ... I must put in mind not to be trapped in real-life stereotypes, after all it's a tale and it has to be interesting, it has to have the charm to let people love the characters and what happened among them. More study's still needed ... or maybe I think too much un-necessary stuffs. Phew ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streets of Jakarta's indeed full of negative aura ... get caught in it and you'll suddenly be a stressful guy. Take deep breath, never let it controls you *pats cheek*. And I almost forgot to pay the soto I ate =P. Luckily no one ran out and screamed "GET HIM!! HE DIDN'T PAY FOR THE MEAL!!" XD.
