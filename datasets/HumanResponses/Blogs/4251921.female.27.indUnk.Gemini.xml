      I've been having trouble sleeping.  Well, not really.  I can sleep allright but I have these Godawful dreams that wake me up.  They aren't even the scary kind that are at least interesting to think about the next day. Like "What the hell did I eat last night that made me dream about long legged owls wearing blue jeans chasing me through my 1st grade classroom while screaming shutup" No, I've been dreaming about work.  Usually, I have a row of figures from one construction bid and I'm trying to compare them to a 2nd bid.  How freaking boring is that!  But it creates a really restless sleep.  Then at 4AM, I am wide awake.  I feel so AWAKE!  More awake then I've ever felt in my entire life.  I could read a book on the "Philosophy of Physics" and still be wide awake.  I know because I tried.  Then at about 5am I drift off to sleep only to be awakened 2 hours later by the alarm.  I awaken feeling so groggy, almost hung over like.  And now it is 11am and I am so tired.  I ...just ....want ....to ....take ....a ...nap.

      I came to work today, checked my e-mail and there sitting in my inbox was an e-mail.  An e-mail from someone I went to High School with.  Someone I haven't spoken to in about 8 years.  I got that kind of panicky feeling before opening it. I always expect the worst.  Was she going to tell me about some unexpected tragedy that had befallen her or a mutual friend or even worse relate how wonderful her life has been since graduating.  Of course, it was the latter.  She's married, has a house, baby on the way, and has a great job.  Oh my Gawd, I can't breathe....  How can I compete with that? I'm still figuring out what to do with my life and right now I'm not even close.  I have a boyfriend and we've been together almost 4 years but we have no definite plans of getting married. And kids?  That isn't even a thought.  We are in escrow now for a house but every day feels like we are periously close to losing it due to my bad credit.   Since I was born every step of the way has be measured out.  1.  Graduate High School.  Okay, Check. 2. Graduate College. Mmmm, Check. 3. Get a job. Alright, Check. Alright, now what?  I did all that sooo..... I'm waiting........... what's the next step?   MarriageHouseChildDivorceRetirementDeath.   Great can't wait.
