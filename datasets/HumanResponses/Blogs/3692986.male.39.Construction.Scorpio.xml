      This is a house in Lakewood our company has purchased. Over the next few weeks we will be changing it from what you see here into another house all together. We will be taking the entire roof off and adding a second story. We also will be changing the total look of the house. Keep a watch and you will see what we can do to a house built in the 50's.

       I figured I would give us all a few pictures to look at while  urlLink K  becomes aquainted with blogging. It might be a little slow start because she has to go to her Mom's to work on the PC.( besides having to take care of  urlLink Adira ) If anyone has any questions on how to post just  urlLink e-mail me . I'll be glad to answer. It's really simple. You just  urlLink sign on  and it kind of does it itself. If you want to post pictures just email me and I will send you an invitation to join  urlLink Hello . Or just join it on your own. Once you have joined please make a post (simple is fine) just to say hi and let us know you are going to post. I ee that  urlLink Kim  has joined as of today. Gabriela sent me an email and was experiencing some problems. We will get them sorted out. Hope to be reading about you all soon!

      This is the very first post.(done by Lane) Kristina will be the admin. and will take care of  whom ever wants to be involved. My prayer is that this will help us all to be able to keep up with each others day to day activities. It only takes a few minutes to make a post and if we all commit to a few  minutes twice a week we will become closer via reading about our days on this site. (and posting pictures of course) Much love to you all and hope to be reading your words soon.  Lane
