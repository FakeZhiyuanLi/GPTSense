Umm..Katie..I'm still trying to find out about the Sheryl Crow song..I can't find anything online......        what else.. yes.. I think that pretty much covers it.      This template is ugly..I shall change it soon.      5 days until CP! Get excited..      direct quote from the mouth of Betty today: "$3.49.Please drive away!" hahaha funniest thing ever...

      So, Ben and I played our little match at 8:00 this morning.  I won 6-2, but he put up a good fight!  We should've warmed up longer.  Next time, we're going to play a full match.  Oh, and I'd like to thank Heather for NOT showing up.  You never fail to disappoint me!  (Haha, just kidding.  I know you probably got to bed really late.)  Ben, it was fun...we shall meet again!  Kayla-

       So for whatever reason Ben mentions tonight that he could beat Kayla in a game of tennis.         So now its on..      Kayla will dominate you tomorrow..        And I will be there to witness it..(hopefully..ha)

        Ex  cuse me Heather...you don't want to work with me and Nicole....that hurts! Haha. Oh and Kayla, I really think you should do the play, it is what you love doing and you are really good at it! And if doing the play and work becomes too much for you, then I would understand where you might consider quitting. But whatever you do, I support you, and just remember to do what you love!  Of course, I know you just have to LOVE working with me too, so if the only reason you would be staying at work was because of me...I would feel really touched. Ahahahaha!  I really don't want to work tonight...but that is only because I have to work with Ben EVERY day this week. Ahhhhhh!  k-

      I get to work during the day today...without Evelyn...I'm lovin it!  School starts in 5 days and counting. Lovin it? Not so much.  What do you guys think I should do about the play/work situation? Of course, you're all going to be biased, but nonetheless, I want your opinions.  -Kay   ~~~~~~~~~~~~   HEYYYYYYYYY! I'm lovin it is my phrase...not yours.    I think you should do the play.  Evelyn already called me this morning...I think she gets sad when she doesn't talk to me....hahahaha.  Today is Friday the 13th and I'm afraid to go outside. I really don't want to work tonight. Especially since katie and nicole work together...  Ok..now i'm going out..  My classes don't start until the 30th...hahahahaha...    Good bye.    h-

      So I   finally   got Heather's email about joining this...and I'm so excited, let me tell you! Just kidding.  It's rumored that someone got a little wet at work tonight...quite funny...but very WRONG.  Someone needs to put a really long post on here.  All of these are short! Perhaps that'll be my job for another day.  Our new uniforms are U-G-L-Y! Anyone agree? The manager ones are worse than the regular ones...especially when they're 3 times too big! BLECK!  I'm done.  *~Kayla~*

      So I went shopping to day and I bought a dress at Old Navy for $12.50.  I was like awesome!!! And then I decided to go to Taco Bell and I um, sort of ran over the curb a little bit when I was leaving.  I laughed at my self.  Then I came home, and I was like, "Hey, I think I'll write in my blog!"  So now I am going to go.  Buh Bye.

      So, this is my first blog and i have absolutely no idea what to put!  Well i sleep in untill 11 today(so late!) because last night we, Sebastian, Ben, Nicole, and I, played hide-and-go-seek at DQ -in the dark-!So much fun.  Then Everbody came over and we watched "The Italian Job"  and ate snow cones, which I made, until 2am.  And the night before we t.p'ed our boss and Sebastian.  Forking and all.  Oh, and um I met this freaking hot guy at the "Open Show"  (right Krystal!) on Sunday.  That's my days.  I'm outta here!

      Ok, so on Monday we had to take Shadow to get her ears clipped.&nbsp; I was so sad, but it had to be done.&nbsp; At least that is what my dad wanted to be done.&nbsp; Anyway, Shadow kept taking the stuff out of her ear that was holding it up, so we had to take her to the vet and see what we should do about it.&nbsp; Well when I came home from Krystal's house today my mom called me on the cell phone and asked me what I thought of the dog's ears.&nbsp; I hadn't seen them yet, so I didn't know what she was talking about.&nbsp; Shadow was in her cage, so I couldn't look very closely.&nbsp; Well I went and looked at them and&nbsp;I thought they had stuck straws in her ear and then put tape all the way around that.&nbsp; I laughed a little about it.&nbsp; But then when I got home from work,my mom told me that there weren't any straws in her ears, it was actually tampons.&nbsp; I was like "What?!?!"&nbsp; Why did they have to do that?&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; I have no clue why they did that, and personally I don't really want to.&nbsp;   And now I am beginning&nbsp; to think that this whole Cedar Point thing might not turn out so good after all.&nbsp; Thanks to   some people   (or person!) who think they know everything and if no one believes them, then that person thinks that everyone else is wrong.&nbsp; I give UP!   Well I think it is nice enough to go for a litlle stroll outside today, don't you Kayla?!?&nbsp; Muahaha   !Adios chicas!&nbsp;   Kate-

      So today I had a choice of going and seeing my new nephew, but I really didn't feel that well so I decided against it.&nbsp; My mom said it was okay since my brother, Ryan, and his wife never really pay any attention to me either!&nbsp; So I decided to go to Plymouth to K-Mart because I saw some sheets in their ad that looked cool.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; They didn't have them at the store.&nbsp; Ugh... .&nbsp;&nbsp; So before I went my dad TOLD me that the next time, you know who calls, I have to answer and tell him 'no'.&nbsp; I was kind of mad, but my dad thinks that I should learn how to say 'no'.&nbsp; Ugh... again.&nbsp; Now that I have vented, I think I will go and do something a little more productive with my day.  Oh yeah, my doggy had to go and get her ears clipped today.&nbsp; Poor little thing :(&nbsp; I can't see her until tomorrow.&nbsp; She is going to look really funny!&nbsp; hehe!  And um Krystal, not Krystle, good luck tonight.&nbsp; You better call me and let me know EVERYTHING that happens!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; lylas!

      I am so excited because my sister-in-law just had their baby boy, Seth.&nbsp; He looked really cute in the pictures.&nbsp; Today, I was sitting on the couch singing a song about my other nephew, Rylan.&nbsp; It went like this:&nbsp;   I don't like baby boys I don't like baby boys Especially the&nbsp;fat ones!  No, he really is chubby, but he is kind of cute!&nbsp;Just kidding, he is cute.&nbsp; Anyway, I got a new stereo for in my bathroom tonight. It is so small, but it is really neat.&nbsp; And something else happened today, but I can't remeber what it was.&nbsp; Oh wait, I remember, but I can't say.&nbsp; You guys wouldn't understand it anyway!&nbsp; I have nothing else to say right now, except for I can't wait until Saturday.&nbsp; Yaaaahoooooooooo, Cedar Point!  Hasta la vista...baby! Kate

      Oh my goodness!&nbsp; On Monday my mom and I were going into CVS.&nbsp; I was driving the Jeep, and getting ready to turn in, when I heard this really loud noise and we started moving forward.&nbsp; We got Hit!&nbsp; I was like, "Mom, what the heck just happened?"&nbsp; Seriously, I started to cry.&nbsp; But now I am better.&nbsp; And no one was hurt, so that's good.   Yesterday and today were fun.&nbsp; So I went to the 4-H fair with my friend Jess to go and watch&nbsp; Krystal.&nbsp; Well, on&nbsp;Monday night Krystal gave me the directions to get to the fair.&nbsp; (I had been there before, but I forgot the way)&nbsp; So we start going, and I realized I forgot the directions at home.&nbsp; We figured we could make it there okay though.&nbsp; Anyway, we got lost and we had to call Krystal's mom and ask for help.&nbsp; She laughed at us.&nbsp; We made about three U-turns that day!&nbsp;Finally we got there.&nbsp; &nbsp;She was showing pigs yesterday.&nbsp; She did pretty good, but her brother won like 3 trophies.&nbsp; So anyways, Jess and I hung out the whole day, and then AI took her home and went back.&nbsp; And then today, I went back again, and I helped her wash her steer.&nbsp; It is the second biggest one there.&nbsp; It is FAT!!&nbsp; And then I keep hering that there were going to be severe storms around three today, but nothing happened.&nbsp; So when I went to work, I thought it wasn't going to storm at all then.&nbsp; Well all of the sudden it started getting really dark and really windy.&nbsp; I got scared and freaked out.&nbsp; So later when it was rainy really hard, Krystle and Sebastian dared me to run out to the dumpster quick.&nbsp; Well I didn't trust them so I got the key from Krystle just so I could get back in.&nbsp; Well when I came back, Sebastian was holding the door shut and I was locked out for ever.&nbsp; I was drenched!&nbsp; My hair frizzed out, but I didn't care.&nbsp; and then we had a Windex fight and they got it in my face!&nbsp; Ugh...!&nbsp;&nbsp; WOW, this is really long.&nbsp; I hope you like it Heather!&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Wow!&nbsp; I love that song, the words, they are just so true.&nbsp; You know how somedays you feel like crap, and you just need someone to talk to?&nbsp; Well He is there, and even though you can't hear Him, you can feel Him and sense His presence.&nbsp; Sometimes when I am bored or worried, I find myself talking to Him.&nbsp; It comforts me in no way that any other person can.&nbsp; I know He is watching over me, and even though He knows everything I am thinking and everything I do, all the evil things, He still forgives me.&nbsp; Somedays I wonder why He sticks around.&nbsp; Even though I hate to admit it, somedays I just get so mad at Him, even though He did nothing wrong.&nbsp; And then I find myself wishing that I could go back and take back everything I said.&nbsp; Even though He forgives me, the things I say will always stay in my head.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I saw a garage sale  Pulled up in the yard  Found a statue of Jesus  It was 8 feet tall  He held out His arms  And He seemed all alone  So I loaded him up  And I drove Him home &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Out by the driveway  He looks down the street  With long hair and sandals  Made of rebar and concrete  I painted Him white with a long purple robe  He's a rock of ages on our gravel road &nbsp;  &nbsp;  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  Standing taller than a tree  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  A bigger man than you or me &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I thought loosin' my job was  The end of the world  Till my best pal ran off with my best girl  I felt suicidal with no real friends  So I walked outside with a rope in my hand &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Out by the statue there's a big Oak tree  So I stood on His shoulders  And I counted to three  I had every intention of buying the farm  But when I jumped off  He caught me in his arms &nbsp;  &nbsp;  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  Standing taller than a tree  He's and eight hundred pound Jesus  A bigger man than you or me &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I wanted to return the favor to Him  'Cause I never had a more solid friend  So I painted some flowers  All around his feet  And bought him a flock of ceramic sheep &nbsp;  &nbsp;  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  Standing taller than a tree  He's an eight hundred pound Jesus  A bigger man than you or me &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;He's a bigger man than you or me&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Ugh...you know what I hate about summer?  All the freaking flies!  They are everywhere you go:  when your eating, when your sleeping, or when your mowing.  Don't you think they would get the picture that we want them to go away.  I mean, we have fly swatters, made just for us to use on them.  And if you don't know me, you wouldn't know that I hate insects.  I am not a big "nature" girl.  Sure I used to go camping and stuff, but that's about all.  The last time my friends came over, we slept in the tent, and Jessica and I made Krystal get all the bugs out of the tent, we hid under the blankets.  So, just to re-cap, I HATE FLIES!!!    Roses are red Violets are blue Sugar is sweet But flies AREN'T!!!  That is all I have for today  Did you notice I posted twice in two days?   I'm almost as god as Heather!

      So tonight Heather calls me from work and asks if she can come over and "do something" to Ben's bed.  I was like, "sure, why not!!"  So we put Saran wrap and tape all over his playstation and controllers.  Then we put Saran wrap and tape on his bed, and wrote on it with whipped cream.  Except for the whipped cream started to melt and ran all over the floor.   Oh, and we also started to hang up his underwear all over the basement.  It was freaking hilarious!!!  Then, when Ben got home, he didn't even see anything.  He is blind sometimes.  When he saw the basement he got soo mad and went and woke our mommy up to tell on me.  She didn't even care!!! Muahaha!!! We got you good Ben.  Watch out, operation fool proof...is on!

      Okay, this will be a long one.  So last night after work Nicole and I went out to Jessica's to go tubing.  It was so much fun, but now my arms are sooooo sore!!! Then Nicole came to my house, and Nicole, Ben, Andrew, and I all watched the fireworks, and lit some of our own.  Then at like 11 Jared came out and I made pizza and popcorn chicken for everyone.  The only problem was, I spilled the chicken all over the floor.  Opie still ate it though.  Gross!  Then at 12:30 we all went to Heather's house to meet Heather, Sebastian, and Amy because we were going to go and t.p. Scott's house.  So we go to Scott's house and start t.p.ing, but Nicole, Heather, and I all hear this noise, and then everyone starts running for the cars.  All the sudden I see two people dressed in black, with masks on, running at us with paintball guns.  We jump in the car and go back to Heather's house.  And then we realize that we left, like, 48 rolls of toilet paper at Scott's.  So everyone but Ben and Opie went to Meijer in Nicole's car with Sebastian driving.  When we got back we couldn't find Opie and Ben, so we went to Scott's thinking they might be there.  But their weren't.  So Sebastian and Jared go to check it out up by Scott's house and they never came back, so finally us girls went to see if we saw them, but we thought we saw someone in the tree so we ran back to the car.  Finally we got a hold of Ben and Opie and they came out and found Jared and Sebastian. Then they left to go and get their paintball guns.  We still couldn't find Jared and Sebastian ourselves though.  Finally we get the courage to go up and see for ourselves and then we start t.p.ing some more.  Finally we go back to my house, but ohh, it is still not over.  Ben, Opie and I all wait at my house while Heather, Jared, and Sebastian all go to Wal*Mart and buy more toilet paper.  Then at 4 we go to Scott's again and get him good!! But when we got done we realized Ben has a very flat tire, so 6 of us had to fit into Heather's car which only fits 4!! And Jared was driving.  Then as we went to pull out, a cop goes buy, and he slows down.  We are panicked.  Then He follows us to the stop sign and flashes his lights at us.  I am freaking out, and Sebastian keeps making jokes to lighten up the mood, but it didn't work!!  Finally he tells us that the plates on Heather's car don't match those on her regisration, so he goes to his car for awhile, and then comes back and tells us that he should impound her car right then, but he wasn't going to.  He told us we would have to go and get Ben's truck today , which we all ready have done.  So yeah, now Ben and I have a curfew, and we aren't allowed to go t.p.ing anymore.  Well I am soooo tired. Talk more later.   Buh Bye!

      So, at like 10:10 last night Ben shows up at work, and I was like, "What are you doing here?"  Well apparently, Opie and Ben were going to go to the fair together.  So Nicole and I decided to go together too.  Then at the fair, we found the boys, and we were only there for 15 minutes because they close at 11.  Bummer!  So the boys were like, "How about we go to the 'Yoder's' house and watch a movie?"  And then Kayla, who was very tired, came too.  We watched "Shanghi Knights" witch was funny, but Nicole had to leave at midnight.  So then I put in a pizza, and we fought over who got to sit on the couch, and then I spilled pizza on me.  Then we had a pillow fight, and unfortunately, the girls lost.  So then, Opie, Ben and I all slept in the basement.  It was very uncomfortable sleeping on the floor.  But all in all I had fun.  I guess!  Buh Bye Now

      Ahhhhh.....more drama! I just don't understand why people get upset for little things, and then turn it into a huge thing! I know I do it sometimes too, but it really sucks! And I am sorry if I made anyone upset the night before, but I thought we were going to watch a movie, and then we didn't......so I got bored! I did come back though! Anywho...tonight was, shall I say, VERY interesting! Ben makes me soooo mad,   * takes a deep breath, and then counts to ten *  , but I am used to that by now...haha! I am soo tired, but I can't get to sleep.... I am excited though because my cousins and aunt from New Hampshire are coming up tomorrow for a whole week. Yay! To bad we have to go back to school though...I won't see them as much now. Ya, Patrick..he is my age and he is usually the nice one....Aaron, he is in 10th grade, he can have a temper...and he looks just like Justin I think.....and then there is Brian. I am not sure exactly what grade he is in...but he is soo cute....and very hyper. My Aunt is really nice too...my mom loves it when she comes to visit because I think growing up they were really close. And the best part about them coming to visit is that they always stay at my grandparents house...which is right across from ours...Who knew. Anyway, that is all I have to say, so goodnight all....and remember...those bed bugs hurt when they bite...so it is probably a good idea not to let them! As you can see, I get really stupid when I am tired......  k-

      To start things off, I would like to tell you all how mad I was last night at my parents.  They wouldn't let me go t.p., and my mom's reason was:  She didn't want me out driving around late at night, and if I had to drive back by myself to meet curfew, she was afraid I would get a flat tire and I would be stranded all by myself.  But of course she  wouldn't mind if it was Ben because Ben is a boy, and I am a girl and apparently I can't stand up for myself as good as he could.  (I was like, "mom, have you checked out his muscles lately?  Well of course you haven't, there is nothing to check out!")  I am stronger than him, he is a twig.  I could snap him in half.  Anyway, this morning Ben came up to me and asked me if I enjoyed not going T.P.ing last night, in a real smirky tone.  Buttminch!  Haha.  I seriously crack myself up.   And now I really am looking forward to the end of the week because I really need that paycheck.  I just bought clothes from Hollister on-line and I need to pay my momma back now.  She'll just have to wait, now won't she?   Oh ya, now I am really confused, which doesn't happen that often, but you know.  First I thought Krystle was quitting, then I thought Amy was going to be fired, and now I read Kayla's blog and it seems like she might be quitting.  Well, you know, if anyone wants to help me understand this a little better....feel free to.  Ya, so now I am bored and hungry and I still don't know about Saturday night Nicole, but I will let you know as soon as I do know.    k-

       I am so excited now! My day started out good because my mom and I went into the travel agency today to book a cruise in November. The bad thing was, they were pretty much sold out because it was over Thanksgiving. I was bummed out, but my mom said we would figure something out. So I went home and started looking over the schedule at school and all the possibilities. The table was literally filled with crap about the cruises. So then my mom found this promotion in her Sam's Club brochure for really cheap tickets aboard the Oosterdam, the exact same ship as last time!!! So she called about it and they were going to give us this room with a window, but by the time they went to reserve it, someone else all ready had. So the lady said she would find us something and give us a call back soon. Well about five minutes later we got a call and she told us there was an even better room available and it wasn't even that much more. So my mom put it on hold and she is going to call back tomorrow and confirm it. The lady said that if they don't still have that room available they will have to automatically give us a better room for the same price!!! How freaking cool is that?! So I just checked my mom's e-mail and the confirmation came about our flight tickets, so now all that is left to do is to book the cruise, which all my mom has to do is call. I can't believe it. We are going on another cruise, and it is the week right before Christmas break, so I will get three weeks off.  Yay!    So then I was so excited that I went into work at five and realized I didn't have to be there until seven, so now I have to go and get ready AGAIN! Oh well, I don't care. I am going on a cruise, WITHOUT BEN! What could be better? Tough question, huh?!  Okay, so I am still mad about the whole deal last night, but this just made it seem so much better. But don't think I will forget about it. I will never forget about it. Moron!   Pssh...In your face buttmunch.    k-  P.S.: I am SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY!!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!       k-

      I am really ticked at a certain person right now.  You may not know who you are, but by the end of this you will.  So tonight went well, until about 9:45 when I heard someone outside.  The noise ended after awhile, and then about 20 minutes later I heard it again.  I knew who it was, everybody in the house knew who it was, but we wanted to see what this person would do.  You were at our house for about 15 minutes.  We knew you were out there, but we didn't know where you were.  You kept calling, and you wouldn't GO AWAY!  We could hear you, and we saw your car.  My mom couldn't sleep, she was really mad, and ya....that is pretty much all.  So now you know how my night went....thanks to SOMEONE!  I am gonna be all right, I am gonna be all right!  Hopefully.  I won't be mad at you forever, but right now I am.  I will be okay in the morning.....goodnight all!  k-

      So tonight was a lot of fun!  We sat down and ate supper together as a family.  Which hasn't happened in months, simce we are busy with work, and my parents are too.  So we had steak, mmmmm steak, and corn on the cob!  I was such a ditz durring supper, and I forgot to mention that my two nephews were there too.   Rylan, who is 1 1/2, ate 1 1/2 ears of corn.  He is a chunk.  OMG!  And then afterwards we took them back to my grandmas house so we could play crouquet.  Ben won everytime, I came in last and third.  He is evil, but ya..it was still fun.  That was my night, so far.  Maybe if I feel like it I will write in here some more later tonight...maybe not. So just in case I don't I will tell you goodnight now, and have a grrrreat day tomorrow!  k-

       I don't know what to write in here for today. Pretty much because I did nothing. I spent the day with my cousin because she was bored to death at my grandma's house! She is fun though. And I don't have to work tonight, so I don't know what I will be doing then either. I am also a little confused. I am not sure who is still mad about Cedar Point, but I think it is just one person. Oh well, I don't really care. And yeah, I am really tired because I didn't go to bed until 12:45 last night, and my mom woke me up at like 6:30 to help her fix the dog's ear. Ugh...stupid ear! I love Shadow though..hehe! Okay, goodbye for now.         Kate-

      Cedar point was aweome!!!  At first I didn't want to ride on any of the rides, like at all!   But then we went on this small one, and it was ok.  So we went on another one, but they didn't tell me until we got to the gates that you stood up on it.  I freaked out, but i did survive it.  Later, they were starting up the dragster so Heather and I decided to get in line, but no one else wanted to because Kayla said it would take, "To long!"  It only took us 30 minutes and we were on it.  I was freaked out about that too, but when I was done, I couldn't believe how much fun it was!!  And later, we all went, and I rode in the very front row!!!  My eyes started to water because of the force.  You know what was the best part?  The part where everyone but Heather and I decided to go on the water ride, and they didn't ask us first.  Ya, we got soaked.  So then Heather and Kayla and I stood in line for an hour and a half, just to go on the Millenium Force!  But it was worth every second.  At the end of the night, we split up and Heather, Jared and I all went on the Rip Cord.  I loved it.  It was like nothing I had ever experieced before!!!!  I screamed so loud.   But then on our way back we saw the dragster and thought it would be cool to go on it at night.  So we went and got in line, which took about 30 minutes.  Well we thought that the others might still be doing some of the other rollercoaster.  But just in case they weren't, we made up a lie to tell them so they wouldn't get mad.  We told them that I got sick on the way to do the rip cord, so we had to wait a little while, and that on the way back we had to stop at all the bathrooms, because I really thought I would throw up again!!!!   Well they found out the truth today, and let me just say, they were pretty mad!!   But you know what?  I would have done it again.  It was so awesome to be sitting there, going straight towards the ground at 120 mph, and be able to see the whole park with the lights on!  I want to go back!!   And the night before, Kayla and I went and stayed with Heather at their lake house, and we only got 1.5 hours of sleep.  Well, not Heather!  And then we didn't get back until 2:15 last night, so I selpt in until 12:51 today.  It was great!  Well I got to go to bed now, so I will right more tomorrow!
