      Hey,  This is all so boring... I have nothing to do.  I just watched president regans funeral thingy.... he was president the year i was born.  So it kinda means a little bit, not much.  I played risk.  My dad won, he beat me and Tom, my twin really bad.  I read the book The Slippery Slope by Lemony Snicket  A certain person that i really wanted to date told me that she wants to just be friends. I'm totally ok w/ it. :-) (its really ok maggie if ur reading this)   I'm boerd and the dinner mom is cooking smells good  g2g, ttyl, ttfn,  -Danny

      Hey everybody,  This is my first post!  I'm really bored and I'm leaving for my cabin, in Brainerd, MN; today at 3. Or 4 with my mother....... She always makes us late for everything.  I'm really bored :-) I have nothing to do.  I went to a movie with my friend Maggie, that was way fun!  I got in a couple of word fights with my best friend and ex-girlfriend, Mandy.  I thinks it's ok now, she just doesn't trust me.  We would probably still be together had we not if 'stuff had not happened.  I wish it hadn't.  I used to really not like her new boyfriend Nic Lake, but i figured out that hes ok.   Well I have to go out side away from the computer *shudder* on this very awesome day!  I love all of you, -Danny
