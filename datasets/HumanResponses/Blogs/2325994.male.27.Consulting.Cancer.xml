      I remember how the protagonist in Andre Gide's "The Immoralist" was thrilled at the sight of fresh, warm blood oozing in profusion from the young finger of a child who cut himself while playing with a scissor. The protagonist was convalescing from what could have been a terminal illness and this crimson liquid that poured before his eyes filled him with a sense of health that was amiss and life that could have been.  I write this today as this imagery suddenly came back to me while I was staring with no insignificant fascination at the copious drops that squirted from a deep cut on my own little finger of the left hand. I marveled at its lusty volume, its lucid texture, at its engaging colour. I looked captivated as it traced its path around my palm and my wrist, wetting and painting them. I was charmed to see the water turn red in the basin, the skin split into a deepish furrow & the affliction of impudent, cold water on raw flesh.  I was enchanted at this sudden reminder of life.

      Detachment, on the whole & in the long run, is perhaps a good idea. I say 'perhaps' because there are times when doubt creeps in. In relationships, it always makes us the needed & never the needy, so much so that there is no or very feeble yearning in us to reach out, that separation does not make us bleed and that unions make for joys lackadaisical and ephemeral. It makes our memories, of happiness and sorrow, blurred.

      What with a certain modicum of a Kingfisher Strong inside of me & the calm confidence that comes from tucking into a succulent leg of a chicken, I was hoping that the game that unites us a nation, mostly in despair, will have a surprise for us. And to top it all with a Foster's halfway through the game & to continue the spirited performance lacing our veins with Romanov, throwing in some potato chips in between, else they'd feel left out - you know- , and enduring a headache, and lucky distorted positions in the armchair, and not urinating as all the luck may flow out, letting in mosquitoes through the backdoor open exactly at thirty five degrees to the the normal, all that & more - and they go and lose the finals!!

      Recently, on a darkening day of November 2003, in a room dimly illuminated by yellow lamps, there was togetherness and cane furniture. And there were newspapers all over the place bubbling with stories rendered with complete insignificance at that moment. And we did not know where our thoughts drifted and settled finally. And "The Beatles" were singing "all you need is love"..................

      One of the most captivating conversations I had recently was about the translation of philosophy into objective actionable entities in our daily lives. For all my reading, and only a certain portion of them have been what could be called philosophy, I really did not have any ready answer to that. I talked it over with a friend of mine later in the day.   As a first, I feel that this world we dwell in is not completely explained within the paradigm of logic, rationality and reason. If this were so, given all the problems we face today and the underlying 'facts', we would have solved a lot many problems than we have. Versions of truth are coloured by our own perception of it. I feel that philosophy can influence this perception of the world around us & from this changed perception will flow more granular, actionable items in our daily lives. So, essentially, I am trying to establish 'philosophy' as an entity differentiated from our daily lives, spent engaged in a lot of 'operational' details, which on the average are managed without a 'differentiated' point of view. And inculcating a perspective that does incarnate as things we do, is a process that is more gradual than sudden, and requires assimililation more than picking. So 'getting it to work' is a two fold process including 'getting the idea' for a start and then 'living the idea', each of which, I feel, is a time consuming process and also a very personal one. A process that necessitates a certain amount of unlearning, a lot of sensitivity & openness, & does not guarantee any tangible manifestations after all. And all successes or failure in doing so, are perhaps more manifestations of the person & than that of the philosophy.  Also, in addition to changing the actionable entities, a change in perspective can potentially colour the goals we seek. Given this holistic nature of change, we are therefore limited to pursuing ends which still retain their significance in this 'changed' world. So we can face a contradiction of sorts if we do not re-examine our whole world in this new light.

      Its interesting how different words describe & therefore colour otherwise one given state of inertia, event or action. And interesting too is the time and purpose dimension attached while forming our opinions. For example, a state of inaction could be called lethargy or patience, a telling of truth could be honest or tactless. And all of this so circumstantial, that one is constantly bombarded with a myriad of choices & therefore the consistency of our basic persona is violated every once in a way.  And to eliminate this incessant need to flex, we may decide to choose a fixed, well thought out demeanour for our social, personal & professional lives. However, this too in itself is not way out from this quandary. For one, its difficult to be tactful in your professional life & continue to be honest in your personal & social lives. Second, it is demanding at the least to isolate traits of oneself, change just that to a certain degree, & yet retain to a very large extent the pluses that one has. For example, if one chooses to be tactful, he or she sacrifices a certain amount of eloquence or flair at the same time.   So we come back to the struggle to find an equilibrium, to learn to live in our skins.

      Cricket has always been a close accomplice! Right from the days of learning to divide faster & faster to keep up with the required run rate, to learning that a projectile thrown with the same force covers the maximum distance if released at 45 degrees - so thatâ€™s you throw the red cherry back to the wicket keeper - , to learning the art of chewing gum, to learning poetry from a lethargic, almost reluctant,  Azharuddin flick past square leg, to learning flight from a certain Jonty Rhodes, cricket has been a constant, fun filled, philosophy of life.  In the recent Brisbane test, the Aussies were bowled out for a respectable, at best, 323. This after they got off to a brilliant start and getting upto 260 odd for the loss of just two wickets. They had lost 8 wickets for a paltry 60 runs. It was India's turn to bat.  India had had a despicable start to the tour & pathetic memories of Aussie stints in the last decade or so. They had a lost to a county side leading up to this test. There was moisture in the air & clouds further up. There were talks of 'chin music' that the Indians will face from the Aussies. We debated if we could save following on even if the rains curtail play. Our cricketing faculties were crippled and would perish, sooner than later, I concluded.  India scored a clinical 350 odd runs that day at an average of over 3.5, helped by exquisite strokeplay by VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly.   It isn't often that I get my cricket wrong. And It usually does not feel this good.

      Two of top stories featured in CNN today tell the tale of a eleven year old child being starved & beaten to death by her parents and a woman biting off part of her boyfriend's tongue. The element of shock lies not in the sheer brutality of what ensued, but in my own vague rosy notion of a civilized society. I never did think that the USA was a country of freaks though I did see ample evidence of this during my stay in Minneapolis, more on television than on the streets of the city; but then America does on the whole come across as a wealthy, educated society which values the institutions of common virtues.   Is this a country of acute intolerance of even the slightest frustration? Is this a country of so many triumphs, of so many opportunities, of so many comforts that the flimsiest adversity knows no precedents?   Sometimes the burden of worries, problems and constraints on our shoulder keep our feet firmly grounded. It is not such a bad thing, after all.

      This Sunday afternoon of February, two hours past a lunch of breads, eggs & hashbrowns & more than a month from the fabric that defines my daily life - of friendly arms on my shoulders, of singing songs of yesterday, of calling up friends and talking as if we had met just the day before, of the lure of succulent kebabs, of weekend trips of sheer whimsy - , it is ten minutes past four in the afternoon. Time- compulsively, inevitably, & all other -lys I cannot think of-, for a cup of tea.  Water coming to boil, a sprinkling, generous or scanty, of tea leaves- shades of happiness, romance of the reckless years - , the courtship, the extradition of colour, almost instantaneous, the deepening blush, falling in love, to domesticity, a taste of togetherness, no longer of skies and mountain slopes, an unlikely, all consuming & forbidden fornication, of giving of oneself unto the other, so that the leaves & the water are one; so that, beyond the memories of their earlier selves, this crimson concoction is now tea.  And you add some sugar, some milk too, if you wish. And the sip of this beverage, as it traces its warm fragrant path inside you, warms the cockles of your heart, like the memory of the first time you were kissed one ordinary day, suddenly, so that with each passing moment you felt happier than ever before!

      It is easy for an outsider to come into a new land & wrap himself up with cynicism. And no doubt that such cynicism is frequently manifest in juicy conversations around the lifestyles of the locals.   It is however heartening to see the dignity of labour in the American society, be it limited to the middle and lower echelons of the social strata. Hard earned money makes a gentleman here, & it is very good to see that.

       Even now  If I see in my soul the citron-breasted fair one  Still gold-tinted, her face like our night stars, Drawing unto her; her body beaten about with flame, Wounded by the flaring spear of love, My first of all by reason of her fresh years, Then is my heart buried alive in snow.  Even now  If my girl with lotus eyes came to me again  Weary with the dear weight of young love, Again I would give her to these starved twins of arms  And from her mouth drink down the heavy wine, As a reeling pirate bee in fluttered ease  Steals up the honey from the nenuphar.  Even now  If I saw her lying all wide eyes  And with collyrium the indent of her cheek Lengthened to the bright ear and her pale side  So suffering the fever of my distance, Then would my love for her be ropes of flowers, and night  A black-haired lover on the breasts of day.  Even now  My eyes that hurry to see no more are painting, painting  Faces of my lost girl. O golden rings  That tap against cheeks of small magnolia-leaves, O whitest so soft parchment where  My poor divorced lips have written excellent  Stanzas of kisses, and will write no more.  Even now  Death sends me the flickering of powdery lids Over wild eyes and the pity of her slim body  All broken up with the weariness of joy; The little red flowers of her breasts to be my comfort  Moving above scarves, and for my sorrow Wet crimson lips that once I marked as mine.  Even now  They chatter her weakness through the two bazaars Who was so strong to love me. And small men  That buy and sell for silver being slaves Crinkles the fat about their eyes; and yet  No Prince of the Cities of the Sea has taken her, Leading to his grim bed. Little lonely one, You cling to me as a garment clings; my girl.  Even now  I love long black eyes that caress like silk, Ever and ever sad and laughing eyes, Whose lids make such sweet shadow when they close  It seems another beautiful look of hers. I love a fresh mouth, ah, a scented mouth, And curving hair, subtle as a smoke, And light fingers, and laughter of green gems.  Even now  I remember that you made answer very softly, We being one soul, your hand on my hair, The burning memory rounding your near lips; I have seen the preistesses of Rati make love at moon fall  And then in a carpeted hall with a bright gold lamp  Lie down carelessly anywhere to sleep.  &nbsp; Even now  I mind the coming and talking of wise men from towers Where they had thought away their youth. And I, listening, Found not the salt of the whispers of my girl, Murmur of confused colours, as we lay near sleep; Little wise words and little witty words, Wanton as water, honied with eagerness.  Even now  I mind that I loved cypress and roses, clear, The great blue mountains and the small grey hills, The sounding of the sea. Upon a day  I saw strange eyes and hands like butterflies; For me at morning larks flew from the thyme And children came to bathe in little streams.  Even now  I know that I have savoured the hot taste of life  Lifting green cups and gold at the great feast. Just for a small and a forgotten time  I have had full in my eyes from off my girl  The whitest pouring of eternal light ...  Quoted in 'Cannery Row' - John Steinbeck

      A very interesting conversation I lately had was with Manoj. Manoj &amp; self used to work together in the same organization till January, 2003. I have to admit that we did not socialize much then, &amp; in the months to follow, apart from the usual pleasantries that we exchanged whenever we crossed each other. But the weekend before last, we were in Madras to attend a common friend's wedding and had an afternoon to ourselves with nothing better to do, or worse for that matter, than talk.  &nbsp; The conversation hovered around our own goals, both personal and professional. We discussed our weaknesses and prioritized them. And it is during this engaging session that Manoj pointed out, &amp; I agreed almost immediately, that it is passion that one should look for while interviewing a prospective candidate.  &nbsp; Passion almost always guarantees quality work. It means that the employee is setting her own standards, pushing her own limits, that she sees her work as an extension of her persona.  &nbsp; But I think, that the picture is not all rosy. This drive sometimes is a positive handicap. It is unlikely that any&nbsp;organization constantly pushes a person. I am not talking about pressures in the office. Pressure, a lot of times, is just the volume of work to be done. This could act as a slow poison for driven individuals. Lots of regular work means that, for one, it gets boring and therefore it becmoes question of diligence. Add to that the lack of newer challenges and frustration could grow very fast.  &nbsp; So we sacrifice. And if we choose to sacrifice passion, we never had it in the first place.&nbsp;It is not a matter of choice; it is the only way. Passion remains a defining trait in our lives. It is what made a Jesus Christ.

      The moon showed between the branches of the ilex trees, monotonous, but lovely as ever. They were talking now in groups and I heard only a sentence here and there; everyone seemed to be speaking to everyone else of love, without heeding that no one listened.  Then, as the moon disappeared behind the darkened branches of the ilex trees, the conversation died away, and they lay quiet beside one another among the leaves, vaguely listening to the one or two voices that still lingered on, but more and a more softly, till soon they only reached us mingled with the murmur of the stream in its  mossy bed.  -Andre Gide

      And you wait the endless hours. You know it is coming. Or, you tell yourself, you think you know it is coming. The mailbox keeps filling each day. But the mail you want is not there. The phone rings - friends you have nothing to say to right now. You detest the fact that you have to go buy a wedding gift. Will they understand if you did not make it to the wedding? You reckon not - some people tend to rather touchy about marriages. Whats a good wedding gift? You don't know. You really do not care.  Today the rain comes down for a little while. The sun breaks out finally. There is rainbow in the sky. You swear. You wanted to go out for a while to check your mails. But these godforsaken roads with their million puddles and the fiendish sky. The rains are a first rate nuisance. Probably the electricity board will cut off the power now. You have forgotten your laptop charger back in the office. You cannot deliver before time.  The phone rings. Its the one you have been waiting for. You clear your throat and say hello. You notice that the voice on the other side is a happy one. Platitudes and pleasantries follow. And then your manager tells you. Souvik, you have been a remarkable asset to the team and the organization in general. You have been proactive, versatile. You have sought out opportunities and converted them. Your value additions have been a fair number and consistent, Souvik, you this....you that. Its coming, you think, & press the phone closer to your ear. And then it comes. You notice the build up, the working upto the decision, the congratulatory tilt of an American voice. You quickly make a mental note. You are ready with your reply. You have been practicing. You thank your manager for his efforts on your behalf. You modulate your voice a little bit. You dont want to come across as too excited or too nonchalant. You tell him that you are happy, matter of factly.   "Souvik, do you want to join us for a movie?", asks a colleague. You refuse politely saying that you'd love to but may not have time and you do not want to promise anything that you may not be able to deliver. You give her a dry smile. You run your eye through the vast pile of personal mails in your inbox & spot one from your friend who wed recently. You wonder for split second if he is back from his honeymoon. He has not called yet. You make new entries in your calendar for following up with your tax consultant. The day's work is not much. You finish early. You come back home. This is your time for yourself, to read up on Israel, or may be photography. You wonder how some people always want to be surrounded by a crowd.   You have been reading up on photography. "To capture light and the drama it composes, the transformation, or indeed the metamorphosis, of the prosaic into the profound" - is what you want to do as you once reflected. You chuckle at your wordy description, but indulgently. You can tell the aperture setting now  by merely looking at the photographs. You notice in a slightly self congratulatory manner that the quality of light is harsher in the part of the world you stay and therefore you need to adjust for the same, perhaps go up an extra f-stop or increase the shutter speed for a given exposure, to get similar effects as the daylight photographs in the book. You plan to try natural framing too, soon. The sky today is, however, a bogus one. Abrasive sunlight and a continuous dull blue.   You switch your computer on. You need to read up the updated career model document you downloaded in the morning while you were in the office. You want to understand the expectations at the next career level. Its been a whole day since you have been promoted.
