						   They've been throwing about lots of stats about our class of 94. Here are the ones that were repeated during the Admitted Students Dinner and Orientation.  1) 40% of us have graduate/professional degrees. (I'm in that other 60%). 2) Our median age is 33, with ages ranging from 22-55. 3) Our median LSAT was 159. This is 3 points lower than the daytime students' median of 162.  The talking point is that this is higher than all but the past 3 years of entering classes.  It also translates into "This is a stronger section LSAT-wise than any of SMU's current alumni classes." 4) 13% of us come from out of town. 5) The admission rate was around 20%, comparable to the daytime program.  The evening program is naturally going to have a much higher yield (students who accept the offer of admission and enroll), so these two numbers will always be manipulable to pace w/ each other through the use of the waitlist. If SMU is in fact trying to be crafty to increase their USNews ranking (yield is a factor in the scoring), then this would be by far the best way, rather than by excluding our LSAT scores as the Dallas Business Journal article suggested. Our median is not much lower than the daytime students, which means that there are likely only a few students in our top 50% who would not have been in the top 50% had they joined the full-time program, those that made scores 159-162. Also, the evening program is drawing from a smaller pool of potentials, Dallas and the surrounding area and those willing to relocate to go the law school part time, so our lower LSAT score may directly be a result of this smaller pool. If we were lumped together, would we drag down the overall LSAT median for the school? Maybe, maybe not.  6) They are keeping quiet on our GPAs. My guess is our median is around 3.2 (for undergrad). I would say they should average in graduate GPAs to gloss over the undergrad, however this may not improve the scores too much. 7) There are students in the class from institutions such as Harvard, MIT, and Duke. There were others mentioned, but sorry, I'm doing this from memory. 8) We've got engineers (WOOHOO!!!), doctors, nurses, and entrepreneurs. I think there is a vet and a comedian in the bunch too. We've got quite of sprinkling of unemployed job-seekers, and there is likely a homemaker or two. 9) We've got international students, however I can't remember the countries that were mentioned. Kenya and Thailand perhaps? 10) We've got ethnic diversity. Whether critical mass has been achieved is up for debate.

						   It went ok. Career services, library, special programs, so on and so forth. We got a short lecture on the role of the constitution in our legal system, but I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps because we will not have Constitutional Law this semester, and the Dean wanted to make sure we had some background. We broke off into small groups around 9:30pm, and the short session we had was significantly more useful than anything else that was provided in the large group. I wish the schedule had provided more time for small group meetings earlier in the evening so that I wouldn't have to run off early. I also wish they had included a few current students in a panel discussion, perhaps the ones that are excelling at the school, to give tips and advice, rather than professors and past students. My commute home went well. I will be taking 183 home from now on. I won't be making it back out to the social this evening because of the rain, but I'm going to try to make it to the Green Elephant thing-a-ma-jig on Friday.

						   The first day of orientation was so mundane, I can think of no other title for this post.  Pictures, a whole lot of people trying to sell us books we don't need, a packet of papers that no one ever reads, and of course a stream of speeches aimed at trying to familiarize us with things that we need to experience for ourselves to understand anyway.  They split us up into small groups led by so-called tutors, and we will likely meet with them throughout first semester.  For what I'm not sure, but it may be a decent way to make connections with people you otherwise would not.  It ended in a rather interesting discussion about ethics that ran late.  I got stuck in traffic until 11:00 pm on I-30.  I will no longer be taking that route home, b/c there is just too many traffic accidents.

						   So, everyone has been talking about the part-time program. Are we up to the task? Will we become a campus joke? Will we steal the full-time students' thunder with our degrees and superhuman multi-tasking abilities? Apparantly, it was a difficult decision for SMU to make, and I, like the Rowdy Renegade that I am, was one of the first to volunteer to allow SMU to perform a four-year, expensive, high-stakes experiment on me :) The Dallas Business Journal just published an article about us  urlLink here.

						    urlLink Free Speech Zone   Hi! This is an introductory post on my first blog. I'm just stumbling about on blogspot, testing this tool out.  I started this blog because I would like to have a journal of my law school experience, and I hope to use this medium as a way to reach out to other students in my class and law students in general.  Law school is a serious undertaking, and I hope to provide an outlet for myself and others to express their thoughts, share ideas, rant, rumble, complain, and celebrate.
