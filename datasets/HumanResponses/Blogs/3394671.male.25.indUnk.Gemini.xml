      A scientist that is studying the info that the Mars Rovers are collecting has confirmed that methane and ammonia were found on Mars.  That means that there is either active volcanos (which there are none) or life (microbiological).  [Side note: That scientist mysteriously disappeared right before he was to announce life on Mars and no one has been able to get a hold of him.]  So I've been thinking:  What would it mean to Christians if there was found conclusive proof that intelligent life exists in our universe?  Now as Christians we already accept this in the form of angels and demons, but what if there was another race?  What would their spiritual history look like?  Would Christ have to die for them too, or did they avoid a Fall?  C.S. Lewis looks at these ideas in his space trilogy.   Out of the Silent Planet  looks at a world corrupted by evil much like ours and  Perelandra  looks at an Adam and Eve type who avoided original sin (though they came close).  I don't really know what it would mean to Christianity, but I would assume they would have some knowledge of their Creator and that we could learn more about our God through them.   There have been many UFO sightings, crop circles, and other strange phenomenon on Earth and that should make us wonder what those things are.  We can assume that they are in fact something real.  There seems to be some proof that they are more than government experiments.  So why are aliens here and what are they doing?  My theory is that they are not enlightened beings that can bring us knowledge of God.  Most abductions involve sexual experiments, which makes me think that they are demonic.  Since the world has largely rejected demons, this new form, aliens, could be the way they become recognized and accepted again.  In ancient days they caused fear and used that to control humans; in our day they could use enlightened "knowledge" to control and shape our future.  As the end times approach, will "aliens" play a roll.  Who knows?

      The question of whether or not to add an amendment to the constitution defining marriage as between a man and a woman is an issue that Christian voters are asked to consider in this upcoming election, but what stand should a Christian take on this issue?   Personally I don't think that we have a&nbsp;platform to speak out on this subject anymore.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; The Christian view of marriage is a monogamous union between a man and woman til death parts them.&nbsp; Christians have strayed from this view a while ago.&nbsp; Divorce is statistically MORE common among Christians than non-Christians.&nbsp; So many Christians shouldn't even open their mouths to say what the government should do with the institute of marriage.&nbsp; The battle was lost&nbsp;when the courts allowed no fault divorce and the practice became commonplace.&nbsp; It was there that the respect for the institution began its decline, from which this newest challenge arises.&nbsp; The next step will be legalizing polygamy.&nbsp; Eventually, if things continue, "marriage" will be nothing more than a financial/living arrangement that is made official and recognized by the government for the purposes of taxes.   The separation of church and state has made our government completely secular, therefore in defending the institution of marriage we need to enforce it in our churches.&nbsp; We need to be active in working hard to keep marriages together.&nbsp; The church should provide support for those marriages that are struggling.&nbsp; Christians should be open and honest with one another to the point of sharing their stuggles and asking for help.&nbsp; Various groups of believers can gather to minister to&nbsp;and pray for struggling couples.&nbsp; Strong marriages should mentor&nbsp;weak marriages.&nbsp; By making  Christian  marriages examples of what true marriage should be we can change our nation's view.&nbsp; True change comes from the ground up.&nbsp; The example from prohibition should teach us that morality can't be enforced.&nbsp; We should raise our voices and be involved in the political process letting others know what marriage should be, but lets not expect them to listen if we aren't living examples of it.   Did you notice that through this whole blog I haven't even mentioned homosexuality?&nbsp; Here's a few words.&nbsp;&nbsp;Homosexuality is a sin, but&nbsp;homosexuals will continue in it whether or not gay marriage is legal or not.&nbsp; There is such a wide gap between Christians and the gay community today.&nbsp; There needs to be more bridges built between them, not to condone what they do but to treat them as human beings.&nbsp; We need to show them love.&nbsp; That means becoming friends with homosexuals and&nbsp;being there for them when they hurt.&nbsp; They feel the pain of being ostrasized and hated.&nbsp; Their hearts get broken when a partner leaves them.&nbsp; They need somewhere to be there for them when their world falls apart.&nbsp; Any Christian who truly understands the depths of their own sins, especially those they continue to struggle with time after time, should be hesitant to speak out in judgment of another and quick to show the love and forgiveness they have received.&nbsp;   Let us use this amendment issue to open up lines of communication with those who need to be exposed to living examples of love.&nbsp; And let us not be blind to the sin we allow in ourselves, but let us live honestly with one another and form the loving community Christ intended.&nbsp; Let our actions speak the truth.
