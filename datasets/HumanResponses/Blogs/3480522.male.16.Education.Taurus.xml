      Is human really such a complicated being?i dun noe,somehow it should be,but i feel that it is just that people,we,ourselves makes us seem complex.i not refering to anyone else,just talking about myself.i really dun feel like going to cca,futhurmore, somehow i seem to hate acting and paixi.dun noe why...At the start of the year, i was still hoping to be able to act.Or maybe, since the start of the year,that wasn't really my wish.my wish is just to be in the certain group.the worst thing is,though i hate paixi and acting,i seem to like to see other people paixi and give my comments when i feel like it.the interesting thing is that those people there crap very funnily that i am really happy when we are paixi.i also seem to like any-related jobs.but i just dun like to act and paixi,not because i hate or refuse to accept my role.it is just that...dun noe lar.heck care.Maybe my intention of liking and going to CCA is never about paixi but something else...  A secret should always be kept unknown,otherwise it is not a secret

      Haiz,todae i am still leading the same lifestyle.yesterday,slp at 12,todae wake up at 8,then suddenly fall asleep again and wake up at 11.thought i will be able to study,yet all i am doing is playing games,slack and typing at here.why am i such a slacking failure,can't i do something to my own will?i noe the reason,part of it is that i am just a born slacker.i really hope i can buck up,cause o'level this year.just fear i cannot make it to the jc i want.why?cause part of it i reallly like to go there.just a about a few days, and i have cca again.yipee!haiz,but about a few weeks,holidays are over,and i have to be stressed up again.why?part of it,is because...part of it is just that...part of it is due to...dun ask me where is the other part.i am just so stressed that i am a bit of saddened.  You appeared like once and disappeared like forever,making me wait endlessly...

      not sure if i make the right choice.(i definitely didn't make the left choice)have i fallen even deeper into my 'wrong' path(it is not a bad path) even more.though the decision is made yesterday,i am still pondering over it todae,hope that i didn't choose wrongly,otherwise i will be ejected into a dimension engulfed in regrets.    Will this be a path towards happiness or one without it......

      everyone has their dreams, lived on  some hopes , make a wish , haboured plenty desires. sometimes, i feel lost and dreamy,even though i know pefectly what i want, and know what life has stored for me...yet i just dun realised why at times, i will be glaring blankly at the wall,staring straight at the blue sky.Perhaps i have made some wrong decisions , or choose the wrong things , that is why i am here placing my thoughts and emotions,hopefully someday the one will see it and unlocked my thoughts.   One day,some day,days after days,hopes may be shattered,dreams may be broken,but i will still be in one piece.

      This seem to be one of my hardest working holiday month.Or is it the only one?i am actually doing my homework before the last week...Unbelievable.yeah,I know my results sux,so i have had to revise earlier,to prepare myself for the o'levels...But is there a need to do a-maths revision until midnight...Of course not,...Maybe~,yes...cuz there are other reasons. Anyway,here is another quote from one,by myself...the first part is by napolean(is this the spelling?)  ***There are two levers that move Man:interests and fears***And there are two forces that move the levers:love and hatred***
