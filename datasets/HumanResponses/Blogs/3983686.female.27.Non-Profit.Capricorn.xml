      Hi Everyone, I think Im in the mood to ramble.. so if no one minds I think I will. Well no one (except beth as of recent) comes in here anyways.. so what the hey.. Here are some things that have been on my mind...  For one thing.. is it ever going to stop raining?? I mean I saw what appeared to be construction of an ark in my neighbors yard.. not to mention I thought I heard some goats and horses. Last night my son came into my room swearing he saw a unicorn prancing around the backyard.  Why do we always look fat on video? They say the camera adds x amount of pounds..oook..why? Is it jealous of us for being in the limelight so its like.. *insert deep scary voice and cryptic music* mwuhahahaha NOW I take my revenge..* Why cant they make the food thats bad for you taste gross and the healthy stuff better? Am I the only one this seems backwards to? Last night, a man decided he wanted to be on&nbsp; my icq list and not knowing if it was the nickname of a friend that I didnt recognize...I went ahead and added him..we chatted briefly and I decided I wasnt comfortable with the conversation and frankly told him Im quite gunshy with the internet and dont volunteer personal information or anything of the like.. he was annoyed with my defensiveness and wanted to know why I had the internet.... wtf.. am I supposed to be content with him telling me hes not nuts to just take it at that..OOOO EVERYONE IM A %FT$ TALKING AND DANCING SQUIRREL!!CALL ME SANDY CHEEKS!!!!!!!! *dances around and shakes tail* PLUS, did I miss the memo that said computers were invented to go with a worldwide web solely created for chat with strangers to make the lives of psychos easier as they hunt their victims... Ill glady&nbsp; dust off the welcome mat on my *front door* as I continue to live in the dark ages.. thank you very much.   Jaime Besides that.. did I miss

        Im bored. NO other way to put it. I mean dont get me wrong, Ive been finding things to do.. like taking care of my sister after her operation yesterday.. But I feel like something substantial is missing. My mind moves at 1000 miles per hour but lately its filled with trivial bullshit.. know what I mean?      For example...Ive seen my share of tv lately, and on vh1 I caught this show explaining meanings to songs...     Remember that song.. you oughta know..by alanis morisette? ya know the one! going down on whoever in the theatre and i hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.. and each time i run my nails down someone elses back I hope you feel it.. get it now? I think weve all smirked once or twice to that song.. right? Well theyre claiming that she wrote that song personally about an ex.. (you might have even seen this episode already..) they said its about Dave Coulier.. (Joey From Fullhouse) I was like !!!!!!!!!!!!!!I find this hysterically funny.. am I the only one? I mean COME ON.. snarly intimidating Alanis 'dont fuck with me' Morisette... goin down on Joey in a movie theater?&nbsp; Was he laughing like Popeye while she tickled his nuts???&nbsp; I mean thats like picturing my rockstar brother hooking up with that black lady with the shower curtain on her head that does the commercials for Honey Bunches Of Oats!&nbsp; Funny shit.. Ill leave it at that.. give me your take on it!

      Hey everyone! So glad to see you find the place.. It seems everyone these days is having a blog, and its true I have more than enough things to say.. so why&nbsp; not jump on the band wagon? As most people know, I reign from the message board days, where my friends and I frequented the tub clubs and various hot spots, and it was a real blast. I certainly hopes this catches on, cause Im basically trying to recreate some of the laughs we had back in the day.. Im gonna invite anyone to toss in their 2 cents about whatever, or funny stories.. just please join in..leave your comments..good or bad.. and come back often.. who knows this may even turn into a journal of sorts for the lot of us.. whatever it is.. lets take advantage of it...  &nbsp;  Jaime  &nbsp;  p.s. Happy Birthday, Kendra!!!!!

      Well howdy all... been awhile since I rambled.. the quiz was a major flop it seems.. sorry to take up good blog space.. maybe I can come up with something more appealing to any of my loyal bloggers...but not tonight... tonight is a night for sad dribble..  Im sure most of you all know that my brothers band, seventh hour, has decided to call it quits.. and its just symbolic to me.. When this band started WAY back when they were Allstar it was such a new thing to me for so many reasons.. its was a time of my life when so many things were changing.. it was a like a door was being blown open.. for those of you that know me well Im sure you remember. Anyway it was totally exciting and I wanted to be a part of it in any way I could and I was really thrilled when I got to "come along for the ride". I was living with my brother at the time, who was also managing them, and they were practicing in his basement, and it was there that not only did I start many long lasting and cherished friendships, but I met my husband. We became fast friends and got to know each other through being a part of the Allstar experience.. him being a drummer for Searching For Gladys at the time, and had some great laughs and great shows til we finally got around to dating and the rest is history.. we're married with kids and tried to make as many shows as we could.. and usually were put out when we did miss something! I feel as though this band is a part of me cause it represents something so personal that I cant even begin to describe.. and now another time in my life has come where things are doing that blow the door off the hinges thing  again.. but it just isnt in a positive sense.. (one of the biggest things is losing my mother in September) and now seventh hour is coming to a close too. It all ties in together, see? Like life is a big roller coaster.  I could go into more detail cause its not just a chic whining about a band breaking up. Im not a groupie.. its FAMILY.  Look at it this way.. where else can I go to see all these same faces in the same place at the same time.. not to mention their originals are honest to God favorites of mine.. and Im not being partial cause of my brother..  To everyone in and a part of Seventh Hour and even the days of Allstar.. thank you for the memories.. they will be cherished and the days will be missed.. love yas!
