      I can not take an apartment where a big ugly fly hits me in the eye.  Now I love old buildings, cracked tiles, crooked stairs, dimly lit hall ways.  I however do not, other peoples sour cooking, blacked out entrances, having my foot stepped on in the dark, or cockroaches.  Always ask about. I even asked to see the roof. It smelled gross, but the view was swell.   Old painted ad on brick, yesssss, the street that ran up with the decadence, the steeple, a greasy spoon cross the way. I’ll call and ask again what year, I think he said the 16oo.  Nope shady sketchy icky places, as the one’s I read about, not want to live out.  I confess I am a hopeless romantic. So here I am decending down into history and time, Down to St. Paul. Stash of cash in my handbag, go down down we go. Smoking like a fiend, feet are noticably sore now. But dig, I’m down, think “Wow wouldn’t it be great if I could find something on St. Paul.”   Look up, and see A Louer, this little soundless phone is perfect for such an occasion. Think I’ll just see what’s going on. Sit on the stair, Huge Oak door, call up. Straighten hair, look respectable, nice coat on an all, get into this office, and it’s been gutted and redone.   Mr. Suit, invites me to look at the blueprints, which I do like indeed, and when asked “How much?” he doesn’t know, or rather quotes me 1,3oo x14 a square, which doesn’t take a genius here. Geezze.   Find out that this was the first building built in old Montreal. That Champlain stayed there. Jumpin! Now that’s the bourgeousie!!   I Can’t help but have good sense.   Enough to know that the shade of lime he chose for his decor was wrong.  So I’m like, okay call you in the morning.  Back on the narrow street. Dig the way. Past tourists, and others, the dubby’s are much politer. I dole my smokes. Poor guy down on his luck with huge yellow teeth, all in French. Spot another A louer.   Dig, it’s big 15oo, for a mere $1,2oo a month. Now why can’t I afford this alone? Damn, that’s a steal! Miss Smith is still sleeping. Man. It’s the bomb!   Cobble stones, and caleshes, horse shit on the way. I make a left into the best part of the whole scene. I don’t care if it’s touristy now, it wasn’t then.   It’s still beautiful. It’s ancient and dark, and the vendors and the barkers, artisans are all clustered together in their doorways enjoying the evening air.   I approach the photographer  “hey, monsieur, do you know of any places for rent round here?” He smiles at me knowingly, and tells me there’s no thrifty digs this way.   So again I go, back to the Dame. Check the door. The sign is GONE. I don’t have his number, damn, damn damn, he had a new fridge and stove in the 5oo.  Called him tonight. N/A. Could kick myself.   Feet hurt. I’m feeling grouchy. Thinking of the first place. Rationalize I would never ask anyone over, never, ewww.  I’m feeling a little dug out . This is where things become beat but not beaten, broke but not broken. At least I speak for myself.  I know that there’s no digs, so I just go about town, muttering to myself, to not get so down, it’s just the first day, have a little faith.   Head up the middle of the square, the terraces filled with espresso romances. Up I head, I spot this kook. And I like kooks.   He is standing there a la Marcell Marceau arms outstreched  in a green tweed suit, and a straw hat. He’s got make up on, which is slightly pealing, he’s obviously been there awhile.   His chalk board sign says “Free hugs -For those who can’t afford happiness” which struck a little melencholy.   He also had a book, in which to comment. I flipped him a little on the spot about wanting to find my place. Then I hugged him.   Now something you should know, I am usually very stand offish, a la untouchable, do not hug type. I mean I can be, but I’m not usually, especially not to strangers.   I walked away, now truely sad, feet are really killing, feeling sorry for that 5oo. He had to work late that Monday night, and I left his number the Tuesday.  I still dig about, knowing I’m not going to find a Louer round this part. Head back behind some buildings and the sun is setting.   I’m walking towards this enormous wall. Big blocks. Makes me think of Floyd, and the Delta, It’s gigantic and reached into the sky.   “This better not be a dead end”.   I think to myself. But no, there’s a narrow set of stairs, and a sign saying Ministere de Justice.   Great. I walk up these steps, and there are what most likely are pink and purple spot lights shining across, but they look like radars from Zargon.   By the time I reach the metropolitan, I can barely walk.  Tomorrow, I’m wearing sneekers, and checking out the art district.   Came home ravenous, good ol’ June just wants bacon and eggs and tea.   That fantastic 1947 stove I have... doesn’t fucking work. The burners have to be replaced. Fuck. “Why didn’t you check and make sure it worked before you told me it worked?” FUCK.   “No no nothings wrong. I’m starving.”: It’s going to take two fucking hours before sup’s up.   FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK. “No, it’s just my period. I feel like shit. Don’t bother me.”  Keep thoughts from going “I’m leaving.” Not until I have a place. Why 3 days?  He starts in on me, all the usual rhetoric,  of I will always... and then my personal favorite of the night was “Will you ever sleep in my bed again?”   “No.”  I know he is aching. I can hear his heart breaking. I’m not faking, and this is no time to call my bluff. His eyes are getting all soft, and I feel like an asshole.   “Don’t even talk.” I warn him. “You don’t want to get into this with me right now.”   I will not fall for this again. It’s more than a million times.  Drink my special found Bengal spice tea. Like a delicacy. Thank God Sugh calls. I love Sugh, she’s going on about packing, little hoodies, stripey dresses, shampoos, pillows, armani perfume, wearing her stillettos to the air port at 6 am. I’m “Sweets, wear j&t, nothing special. It’s going to be 9 am, it’s a holiday. It’s a big ol’ van, filled with power tools and all sorts of sharp things. I’ll bring o’laits.   She did afterall have a coffee for me when she came to pick me up after Scotland. Atta girl.  She tells me she voted for the Greens who have o% as she explained. I laugh, “Gee your vote really does count doesn’t it.” She’s so ironic.  And then of course, her lover E. He is in his 4o’s and she really really really loves this guy. I’ve never ever seen Sugh in love with a guy like this before. I mean she’s really flipped her lid, conservatively of course. They are both crabs, so I imagine that it’s good.  She’s going on about him brewing her tea in the morning, that he has all these nice herbal teas in his cupboard, and I can’t help but tease   “You know your guy is a little sensitive when....” giggle,     “No, no sweetie, it’s okay for guys to be sensitive, it’s nice that way.”   And I love him still.

      Gotta paint my walls today. If I finish it by tonight - tomorrow I can spend time moving in, maybe I’ll paint - just a little, or try drawing a little.   Tall Jane arrives Thursday morning!!!! A week long vacay, that I too am taking off to spend just me and my long distance gal. She’s flying for a buck fifty,  and I am so happy I could shimmy! Plans include, cafe o lait, many cigarettes, year long update, shistawook’s, lots of shirley temples with a shot, discussions of love, and other such intricacies, buying four large canvases, collaboration of design and colour - god how I love to create with her, she’s a genius trapped in a box. Art always brings her out. Pasties, for all 3 of us girls, dirty 192o’s photo’s, jazz, cocteau, cheesecake a la Main. Records, a gogo, the watusi, skankin’, lounging around on the terrasse in robes and tiara’s, discussing next winters trip to Spain - she has a free condo on the beach, trip to NYC in march to the expo.... barbqs and late night jamming with the new sun rec pic love Miss Sm. So that my fingers don’t get so black and bleed.   Working on my application. Finances secured. Deciding between history of architecture and ancient Greek Greek architecture. One is fundamental towards all design, the other is more refined - as I am at some point going to re- enamel a claw foot tub with this beautiful design I found in black and gold. I will research until I know.  I met a printer. Il s’appelle Louis. Il est mon voisin.  He is the proprietaire of his own small shop, 1o minutes away. I will be making some spec’s because they specialize in publishing and printing limited runs. Oh yeah!!   Also, my first show is on begins August 27th!!! Hooooray!   Everything is coming together. I hope you are as well.  Love B

      This morning at 3, we fought for Independence and we won!  The officials lead a large number of people out and stopped up all of the springs, so that no more water flowed out of them.  The king strengthened the city’s defenses by repairing the wall, building towers on it and building an outer wall.  In addition, he repaired the defenses built on land that was filled in on the east side of the old part of Jerusalem. He also had a large number of spears and shields made.  He placed all the men in the city under the command of army officers and had them assemble in the open square at the city gate.  He said to them “Be determined and confident and don’t be afraid of the Assyrian Emperor of the army he is leading.”  We have more power on our side than he has on his. He has human power but we have the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles.  The people were encouraged by these words of their king.  BATTLE  (I know I stabbed something large and scary in the middle of my lucidity}  He let the people live in peace with all the neighboring countries. Many people came to Jerusalem, bringing offerings to the Lord and gifts to him, so that all nations held him in honor.  Offerings for Unintentional Sins	Levit 4-5  Lord told Moses to tell the people of Israel that anyone who sinned and broke any of the commands with out intending to, would have to observe it’s following rules.    “If it is a ruler who sins and becomes guilty of breaking on of the Lord’s commands without intending to, then as soon as the sin is called to his attention, he shall bring as his offering a male goat without any defects.  He shall put his hand on it’s head and kill it on the north side of the altar, where the animals for the burnt offerings are killed. This is an offering to take away sin.  The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the animal and put it on the projections at the corners of the altar and pour out the rest of it at the base of the altar, just as the fat of the animals for fellowship offerings.   In this way the priest shall offer the sacrifice for the sin, and he will be forgiven.  If a man can not afford a sheep or a goat, he shall bring as payment for his sins two doves, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.  In this way, the sacrifice for the man’s sin shall be offered, and he will be forgiven.”  Amen›

      - it goes like this: We were wearing our turtlenecks and sunglasses, and the sun was going down. My heart was broken, and I had my thumbs in my pockets. My flip flops were dirty under my toes, tramping around downtown.   The suits were all black and blue, and in between the dubbys were rubbing for a dime. The shops all played tunes, to compete with the street music.  I thought I might find the Odyssey, the sad book shop. I had a dix to last me two more days, and I knew if I was hungry, so was he. Bought a cheep copy of R&J and Orwell the last time so that I at least bought him lunch. I wanted to find Steppenwolf. I got lost, and wound up in the art district. Tomorrow, I thought - I will go see Cocteau 1/2 price. Sit and think, see what he knows.   Last year I went to see Vulliard when I was leaving. I really liked his theatre programmes. Made me think I could draw after all. And if that counts for inspiration I suppose it might. Bought some postcards and wrote home, always having to leave one room when it got too full of admirers. Wanted to find that little room in the back, with the old furniture just to sit and think and write. I recall that there was a stained glass light in the room, close to the real Piccasso - and I’d never seen a Piccasso before. I think it’s in the main part of the gallery, but I don’t know for sure. I can’t really remember. I guess I’ll have to pay full price for that part of the story.  I dodge the patrons, the women in their gaily coloured depeche mode. Boys wearing pink. I think they all look silly. Everyone looks silly to me now, and I know that they pay way too much to look so absurd. The thwack of my flip hitting the pavement. I realize that I am the one who looks so different, and that they are staring. What ever. It’s always that way. I’m used to it. I do sometimes wonder why me? But that’s just the way it is.  Instead I admire the architecture or archi tec ture as pronounced here. I love the buildings. They are so majestic, even the sky scrapers are art against a sky. My favorite part is when you slip down the s at 4am heading into the city from uptown. The lights like a million eyes awake against the silent city. The machine that never sleeps. The city that never truly shuts up.  Ache Ache Ache. Blistered insole. Wish I could take my shoes off. Too much construction, and can’t be too careful about needles. Not that I’ve seen any, but I also don’t want to either. Pass by the park. The loafers and slackers with paper bags. Scruffys, and wackos. Step quick, ahead ahead ahead. Head down and turned away when wearing impractical footwear. Even still, I got a little fight in me, but I’m never afraid here.  Up the hill. The hill the hill the hill.   The shops are just as beautiful, older and worn in. Less organized, spray painted, garbage on the walk, grating, iron fences, kitchy cheep clothes, junk of all kinds. The theatre, the signage, the upward tilt. No there’s not been a mistake. I just got to get there. I keep on, hoping to reach the top soon. Hit the lights. Drives me crazy the way the pedestrians do traffic here. I’d rather stand on the corner, and look sharp watching the two way traffic to stop. It reminds me of Vancouver. Or maybe we were just too stoned to know.  Find a dep, buy cigarettes, buy green tea. Admire the government buildings. More construction. I break down and cry. Thankgod for sunglasses. It only lasts a song. I’m okay. I’ll be fine. Up ahead is my favorite record shop. I at least I can take the pain.  I will look at the records. I scoff at the name, but it’s cool. I descend the steps. All the best places here are souterrain. I’m not regular enough for anyone to notice, so I slip to the back room. I have to make sure that they will be here when I get back. I already know what I’m gonna get on Friday. Record allowance day. I smile when I think that I’m gonna have a big old mirror and a turntable in the studio where we can dance the night away till dawn.  g

      I was just listening to my radio. I hung off of every song and word he spoke.   I danced the locomotion in my pink kimono,jeans and clogs, the mashpotato is all kicks...   Lazy boy. Crazy boy. Do wah diddy Diddy Dum  Diddy Do.  I am high as any bird And It's true.  Tonight I'm in the mood. Now that I've taken to going out about town seeking sound found out the boheme dream the street light scene late night times is tight wish I may wish I might take me down these streets tonight,  Let's gooooooo Daddy -o Through these doors  Of perception Ache with remembering nostalgic deception I remember everything I remember nothing  I remember looking out black cat eyes Seeking as we saw before Knowing 9 lives  The cafe was blue The wine was strong The hash was hot We kissed all night long......  I'm going to dig down to Dunn's tonight Yup you heard me right? 495-8348  Midnite, I will be waiting for my girl to finish.... and she doesn't know when.  I don't know if she'll even come.  The way she is.   But I have a reason to believe, and most certainly I do.   I will wait patiently.  I will write it all down for you.  Because I remember it in 1964, after the yellow door on a Saturday night. You know who used to come round then.   Oh Where is my pipe???? My pipe - the kitty cat one, blue and white porceline from India? Where is it? I know I put it somewhere around. And there’s a 2o for my pleasure this evening, when I went out and bought myself a decent bottle of Chateau D’Opoul, France.  I was feeling like Beaudelaire and Wilde.  I had my jeans turned up, and my glance was down, I looked a wreck so no one knew me round. I found my poor boy hat. It was the real McCoy, at 195o or so...  That and the glasses. Big one’s, “They were my mother’s ...” I say and pay her tribute.  She was a real dame. A real da ville if you will. And really such a shame.   For tonight I shall speak of love. I?  Speak of Love Shall I?  Exclaims! Such beauty I wrote all day for you Here on this box And now it has gone! As though from existence...  So I will write something of my truest self Unprepared for such an occasion What do I feel this very minute?   The tension is high  My love is stronger  Hearts are breaking It won't be much longer Before I take  A pad Next to  Notre Dame.11:oopm  The only way to truth I know Is to be true.  A million times I tell you what is true.  A million times I love you.  I will bring you tonight to the most special of coffee houses tonight. This is an honour for me to recieve.   I never in a million years would have dreamed of attending myself.  But the time is NOW!  And it is you.   B

      Sunday morning sleepy dreams from my bed You let yourself in from the back door Like an angel in my head  Spoken softly waking my morning tenderly Touching only my soul Surrendering to the innocence within me  You came to collect your paintings laid  On my bedroom floor the ones I displayed  And made love to the night before  Softly like brush strokes Against a vagabond canvase So beautiful my heart broke  I asked you if you wanted to lay Where I'd lain to see my view To see the skys to which I pray  For a moment I allowed you so close That you saw the stars from far away In the bed that I dream from.

      Je suis a ma endroit préferé. I am having coffee with Josée, my friend of 57, where we meet infrequently by chance. He is such a good sort and I so enjoy his company over café corsé and countless cigarettes. He reads outloud from the paper, the world at large while I write you.  I've given you so much ammunition, that you could against myself. In that I tell you that yes fear sometimes creeps in, but I assure you that it is not as strong as my love.  If your impression of me is of a silly girl, wearing my heart on my sleeve - I would reply that you have no idea with what restraint I endure. After being in like with you since 2002, though never making a sign of it, I have. I do love you.  I've told myself a million times - no this is impossible, this is untrue, based on fantasy, pretention and of my own madness.  Yet as each day goes, my conviction becomes stronger.  And I'm not crazy. There is something in the air that tells me...  because I have never behaved this way with a complete stranger.  Such wonderful things are happening to me - yesterday I took lunch with my boss over at St. Drew's found out that my temp is secured for longer than OCtober, and after this project there is more still to be done. This would perhaps lead me to be hired permantly.  This could mean that my tuition expenses might very well be compensated!!!!  Allow me to elaborate: I want to be an art broker. I have been working towards this for more than a year. This is what I truly want to be, and is my ultimate focus. The only thing that stands in my way is that I have no formal background with art history, and I do need to augment my French. Discovered that the U is renown for it's painting classes!!  My boss arranged everything on my behalf and I have an appointment on Monday to find out how to start all of this. Sheesh! I never imagined that perhaps I could start as soon as the fall, but wow, if I could swing it... I would in a heart beat.  Then right after this, I called Senzala, the best little breaky spot in the world, and very shyly asked if I might exhibit my paintings in August! Yes said Alice!! I will be going for a nice little brunch Sunday to set a date. Indeed, I do believe my art will increase the appetite.  I also suppose that I will also find out if they are any good.   With such happiness and complete amazement I tell you of my destiny, as I create it.  Miss Smith, my dearest girl came over last night for RAG's 44th Birthday. We spilled wine and smoked hash and played well into the morning. I let her play my red guitar, that she gave me. "How do you like 'im?" "Sounds so good" said she. Till the landlord called up with "It's past one!!" "How do you like my new song?" "I don't" "Well then good night" Cause I know better.   So we went in and listened to my new favorite record.... oh my god, I'm not evern going to tell you what song is making me absolutely mad with a drop on the 5th talk about... "It is easier to keep half a dozen lover's guessing than to keep one lover after he has stopped guessing" reads Josée outloud. (Helen Rowland, Aces on Bridge Gazette, june 18th 04.)He finishes my thought.   I spend days in a delirious ecstacy. Darling, I am so in love with you. I keep trying to put you down. I've told myself a million times, and asked my self what is true? Inthe grass with God at St. Drew, confessed. When I though I could end it, put on the Lyres and wept with grief.  This ache I create is nothing compaired to my joy.  And I know we are both involved. Soon Come, I will be undone, and free to do as I choose.  And is it true? That I see you everywhere, even when I'm not looking? That I hear your whisper, feel you,if only enrapture?I love you a million times under a San h moon.   It can't just be me. And please, my love, if it is true, say it, and if you are here.... I resist the temptation, I am one delivered from evil.   If you love me even a small bit...don't loose it this time. I will not understand if you will not see me.

      Dearest Diana,  Tis I, yours faithfully, Marianne. I write under a pseudonym now, because THEY may be watching.It is the main reason I still write letters. Albeit not type written on  Ms. Underwood, however, with the intent of a published book, I feel it is as though I can kill two birds with one stone and write here instead.   I am so pleased to hear of your successful escape to St. John’s. It must be beautiful to be beside the sea at the end of the world. I would very much like to see that part of the world, but somehow I feel as though I’m not old enough. My dear Sh - nana, I am thilled that you aren’t working, simply painting. So pleased to hear of Freddy’s lanscaping, I think it suits him well. I hope he brings a note pad while on break.   With a dear and tender recall for that freezing cold afternoon when we all sang L.C.   When they poured across the border  They cautioned us to surrender This I could not do I took my gun and vanished  There were 3 of us this moring  I’m the only one this evening Mais je n’ai pas peur J’ai repris mon fr -me  J’ai change cent fois de nom J’ai perdu femme dt enfants Mais j’ai tant d’amis J’ai la France entier  Un vieil damme dans un grenier Pour la nuit nous a cache  and our hands were cold, and the breakfast was hot. We was like down and out about town. And it was hard and it hurt and I just loved every minute of it. My darling friends, I like the Winter lady, who by fire, who may I say is calling?  Ahhh sweet nights of cheep dep wine, grand and chartruse, the monks in the monestary and the sisters of mercy pray in confinement. Over to your rotten East pad, with out a doornob for free, I’m so glad you were free. And we painted. And Freddy wanted it signed. Because we’re all gonna make it, as we are infamous.  You cried with me over la cafe. Our hearts broke for a space of time that was forgotten, the deco space that I called and no one ever answered down in the old part of town. And we sat over countless cups of joe, to meet and conspire. How I loved that building. I with my chapeau bleu, and a run in my stocking. I endured over the course of time, we were after all at Notre Dame. I prayed to St. Joseph, and to Marguritte for deepness, courage and strength. We wanted the world, and we only had a dime.   Beat but not beaten  Broke but not broken We speak  But are not spoken for  All in time my darlings. All in time. I just wanted to be grateful.  Nana reminded Lou Lou of her poor dead mother. Ses baisais me grises, the Weavers do the English version, it’s all about wife and kids. I just really liked the tune, and you would have been darling in the subway. Lou Lou left Dan, and Dan is now leaving Lou.   Rebecca has her two rooms with a view. Fresh bagels in the Mile end, that huge domed church and the esperenza where all the girls go. She gave me the red guitar back when she knew I was serious. I’m playing alot more now. Infact I practise all week for at least 2 hours, and then sometimes I play all night long. I wrote a little ya ya for her, and it’s hot.  Can’t wait to get 12 more strings and play the Dancer P.J. harvey.  I am also moving the conn organ into the studio where we actually might use it. We’ve agreed to try all sorts of new material, and that I must learn a bf and she is teaching me a little theory, though I find it difficult to wrap my head around it.  These days playing all my diddy’s, good for bar fights and cowboys and outlaws.  How I miss the country.   Proverbs  Truth, wisdom, learning and good sense - these are worth paying for, but too valuable for you to sell.  Son, eat honey; it is good. And just as honey  from the comb is sweet on your tounge you may be sure that wisdom is good for the soul. Get wisdom and you have a bright future.  Don’t be like the wicked to rob and honest man or to take away his home. No matter how often an honest man falls, he always gets up again, but disaster destroys the wicked.  An honest answer is a sign of true friendship. Don’t build your house and establish a home until your fields are ready and you are sure you can earn a living.  I walked through the fields and vinyards of a lazy stupid man. They were full of thorn bushes, and overgrown with weeds. The stone wall around them has fallen down. I looked at this and thought about it learned a lesson from it: Go ahead, take your nap, go ahead and sleep. Fold your hands and rest awhile, but while you are asleep, poverty will attack you like an armed robber.  And idea well expressed is like a desgin of gold, set in silver. A warning given by an experienced person to someone willing to listen is more valuable than gold rings or jewlery made of the finest gold.  A reliable messenger is refreshing to the one who sends him like cold water in the heat of harvest time.  People who promise things that they never give are like clouds and wind that bring no rain.  Paitent pursuasion can break down the strongest resistance and can even convince rulers.  Never eat more honey than you need: too much may make you vomit.  The lazy man turns over in bed. He gets no farther than a door swinging on it’s hinges.  It is your own face that you see reflected in the water and your own self that you see in your heart.   CAAA RRAY ZEEE!! I love it don’t you???  As per my own art, I completed 3 canvases. As per inspired by the streets between 3am and 11 for that stupid advertising job calling Germany all night - wrote chapter 4 rather surrealist  la machine, et la bourgeousie finishing the last bit of cogs and screws with copper powder to make it look like rusted engergy.... more bauhaus in nature. I have decided to be a German painter, under my own name. Frauline....  I looking forward to my space at long last! I have the inclination to do nude sketching, as our friends are uninhibited. Must find a divan!! I will be working on Nouveau portraits this summer as well. I do have a fabulous photo of you darling. In the last week the poppies, no not those ones - are all blooming in our garden out front. They are beautiful wild and free against the gate of iron. God it’s all so beautiful, and I’ve been so passionate as per late. I hope not to fall to the consumption of it all, and I spill wine, not water.  Tonight there shall be festivities on the back terrasse. Our playboy Russian neighbour is having a soiree, chez nous. He very much enjoyed the Dostoyevski I lent him.    I will send the Winter Tree asap. You are wonderful by the sea.   With Love  M.Anne     \

      Tuesday 23rd/o4  The cool blue Swagger  Of the Negro man Against the Rush and the Push Of the Tuesday Traffic Up and down we go  Into the lonley Metro Reflecting on the window The shuttle and bust  Of the echo The irritating comeraderie Of rubbing elbows The sway and push of the slow Down and up we go For into the Push and Rush of the Tuesday Traffic The Negro Man  Swaggers his cool blue.  Down, the dark stairs of depth. The subconcious of the underground. The subway by way of the sub.Everymorning, I go from air and light, atmosphere and decend into darkness, the air of others breathing. The rails of voltage, the currency buried deep beneath the city infrastructure. We are the riders. We stand together united by train time and elbow space. We hang on, swaying on the balance of the collective concious. We do not speak, content to watch ourselves reflecting against the glare of the blackened window , knowing that everyone is preoccupied with reflection. We collectively reflect.   I am one who remembers. I remember from before I was alive, alive before now. A certain melencholy will fill me, and I will remember, a time familiar as if I could simply look behind me and know what to expect. I will smell familiar a dampness in the air.  I will say to myself “There’s trouble in the air”. My freshly ungloved hands are cold. I will remember something that I can’t recall. A certain excitement within the melencholy and I will remember remembering. What it is I truly can’t reacall, not consciously, and yet it is deeply satisfying to know.  I will intrisically feel that I have been here before. I was no one other than myself. Now I am back.  They have begun to recognise me. So it’s not just me.   It was intially a sense of direction that I felt. In the city, where I was born, but had never lived I was easily oriented. I felt I was home. I would stop in alley ways in other big cities and I would look up sadly at the iron fire escapes, laundry hanging above, and I would know that it was not there in those other cities that I could remember this from.  I would describe that I understood with a love and a passion this culture that was so foreign to me for I had never lived it. But there is something about returning from where you once began. I only recently have wondered if  you would be birthed the same year you died. In that case I would have died and therefor been born in 1976.   This sense of direction is a sensation where I can look at the city in it’s current state, and then remember it as it was 4o years prior. It is not a shocking “I’ve been here before!” It’s a more gradual and calm feeling of recall. It is not everywhere and at all times, just certain places that remind me of somewhere I’d never been. And sure it’s strange.I wonder  if am crazy and yet it is not threatening either, because I can rationalise that I am only here now.   The subway is where we are all there. Some are less aware of their reflection than others. It was apparent to me that we are a conciousness within our unconciousness. We are half asleep in the morning underneath the earth, currents pulling us along the track, crowding us together, swaying us hypnotically, balancing on the collective, the trains pass each other at stations the windows look like film reals played by frames. I start to think about the symbolism from outside of the unconcious, other conciousness outside this realm of the train car. We pile in, we rush out. We ride these rails in a state of memory translucent like film in negatives. It always surprises me when someone else has recall, and they remember me.   The first occurance, I was amongst the riders. I looked at a grey haired man wearing a pony tail. He was at least 5O. I don’t remember who he is, or how I might have met him before. It was not a sexual attraction that compelled me to smile brightly. I simply knew him. He soon came over to me, and asked in broken english if I believed in our souls speaking? I was shocked, as this was precisely what I had just felt, and replied “Yes I do.”  He then tried to prompt me further, by asking what kind of music I liked, to which I replied “Jazz”. This was not what he had expected me to say. But I’d been feeling beat lately, and been listening to some old jazz.    I could have replied “Yeah Yeah music, and all of that 6O’s lounge stuff I’d also been listening to - but again I wasn’t all too sure that I wanted to give it all away. Nor did I want to continue to pursue him modern day ,and one can never be too careful leading strangers on closer. Familiar or not. I later that night drempt of a sexual preditor sitting next to me for 3 days continuously on the same bus. On the third day in this dream, he was coming to sit next to me, the other passengers all sat in other seats leaving room in the seat next to me. He got on at the same stop, and approached me with a needle and syringe grabbing my arm, and I knew that he was going to drug me, rape and kill me. I woke terrified.  I decided not to talk to anyone on the subway anymore. I would be content to listen in my subconcious and reflect in the windows, along with the rest of the riders.  At the transfer point it is like an intermission. The riders hurry to the next train, Thousands of passengers, scattering around in every direction lining up for the ride. Every morning there are musicians busking in the lowest floor. I descend with my hand in my pocket, looking for change to drop in. There are sounds of klesmer music, old men singing Elvis gospel, Leonard Cohen,  Lennon’s Imagine - during the first few days of the war, a sax player playing along with a tape, a sitar player, and just yesterday, a trio of 2 violins and a celloist. Everymoring it is something new and different. It is the various artist soundtrack to my subconsious impression. I always take the stairs, singing “go your own way” in my head, because everyone else are like robots on those electronic stairs. Today I saw  some police outside of the photo booth. I thought that it would just be a nother homeless guy sleeping in the booth. It was a child, at least 9 years old. He was very upset and crying. I felt as though something quite bad had happened to him, and he was not so much lost, as he was sad. I rushed past, down the stairs to the lowest level of subway.   If waking life is similar to dreaming, where nothing is tangible - could not understanding symbolism lead us along easier if we paid it attention conciously? Or is that just madness?  To dream of being on or in a subway portends a series of minor set backs and or petty disapointments. This will not last.  Arches - Efforts are in the right direction, as long as the arch was whole and attractive. If it appears to be broken or damaged in any way, a new line of endevour is suggested.  Tunnels signify obstacles or changes, risks or opportunity which causes mental conflict.  All of this symbolism leads me to believe that subconsciously I know something is down there in the tunnels of the metro. More than simply reflection, and speaking to each other with out talking. It is a risk to uncover what is happening down in the subway.   There was a day several weeks ago that I looked up at this very black man, and smiled.  He came to sit next to me when all of the students flooded out the doors at McGill. Our knees made a v” and we did not look at each other, nor speak. I felt “Do I know you” as a question and I could feel him reply “Yessss”. I though about it to myself. And although I recall the 196o’s there is a faint memory in response to the 192O’s . I thought “It wasn’t the 196O’s was it, when I knew you last. He replied” no”, I then thought “You were that trumpet  player weren’t you?” I could see the colour of his blue black skin from the corner of my eye. I did not recognise him physically, but it was his skin tone that I recall. He replied “Yesssss.” “Were we lovers then?” And we both laughed out loud at the same time. “Would we make good lovers now?” he answered. The metro came to a halt and I saw him get off the metro behind me. I got a little nervous, but then dismissed it , I don’t really want to go crazy.  I waited at the phones while he past me, then over took him by taking the stairs and ducked into the cafe.

      A la cafe, nous entendon la musique francais. Je prends de vin rouge, fume ma cigarette, - la joie d'etre toute seul, juste moi meme. My neighbourhood streets are filled with patrons, I treat myself to a little 60's dress, $5, fit me like it was mine all along. Beige and Navy Flowered in that heavy twill cotton they used to make for endurance.  These days, things are wonderful! My studio walls are up, the door is yet to be hung, and I can not wait to lock myself in and paint all night long!!! Must find a divan, for my models to make love on.  Writing chapter 6 with an open mind. Open heart and soul. How I am in love. Learned a little Latin yesterday, Unitas - Unity, Veritas - Truth, Caritas - Love. The dream grows sweeter, and I intend on the further pursuit of Jung's dream analysis. Ornamental dreams: The art of encapulating all of the spring, all of the wealth and abundance of the days and nights in a flower, in the branch of a tree, a birch, or a languishing girl.  Finished a new song for my spill wine girl, and it's dirty. Working on Did He, Do Wa!!! can't find the question mark Gonna buy me 12 more strings, and find some one to string em on.  Writing home to my papa's ... not much time for mopping or ironing these days. though you should see the photo's of Mother's Little Helper. They are hilarious! I am beautiful. Called Maman, told her not to sell my '61, and matching parts car. My girl just got her licence renewed, and I ride and I ride....  I''m taking her out for Sunday brunch, Whoo hoo! La Senzala, and bring a pot of that joe for my table too, Ahhh she's so swell, Fruit bread and cheese - La bomba dia, mon Dieu!  Must RSVP for August.  Till then, me and my girlfriend don't wear no shoes... her nose is painted pepper sunlight, There was so much space that I cut me a piece with some fine wine, it brought peace to my mind in the summer time, and it rolllled....  After the Munich affair, (in chapter 5) it was against this back drop that a scandal unprecedented in the cultural sphere now erupted... visiting ma famille, in August back in Berlin -would be nice to see you too. Could take you to the drive in if you can drive maman's 61 Belle Air... turquoise and white.  The urgent desire for innovative change, the growing awareness that there was no more time to lose, now resulted not just in decorative artistic day dreams, but in clear steps towards overcoming the problems posed by mechanical production methods and the modern city life...  Simple Synergies '' If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people together to collect and don't assign them tasks and work, rather teach them to long for the emmensity of the sea'' Antoine de Saint Exupery  I love being a writer I shouted!  '' Destiny is not a matter of chance, it is a matter of choice'' Oliver Wendell Holmes  If this madness continues, I will be forced to self medicate with the grandness and green. My poppies adorn the wroght iron fence infront of my apartment and the wind blows gently. Confirm that his calm, linear art, is suited like none other to accompany the train of nobel letters like a song.  I love him still.  Marianne

      Romeo: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?  Juliet: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.  Romeo: O, then dear saint, let lips do what hands do! They pray; grant though, lest faith turn to despair.  Juliet:Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.  Romeo: Then move not while my prayer's effect I take. Thus, from my lips, by thine my sin is purged. (Kisses her)  Juliet: Then have my lips the sin that they have took.  Romeo: Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.  (Kisses her again)   Juliet: You kiss by th' book.

      Its been awhile, I know...  Busy little bea that I am, I am soooooooooooo happy!! Everything keeps going my way!!! I finally applied to that Art History program, hope I get in. My girlfriend introduced me&nbsp;to&nbsp;processing people, and&nbsp;they&nbsp;gave me priority. Made my day!  We shall see, if I&nbsp;am not accepted (I was a lousy student 10&nbsp;years ago, I had some authority issues) &nbsp;Then I paint and write and play and well like Bohemia is such a dream that either /either I'm happy. I like creating win win situations.  Having such a wonderful weekend, being introduced to proprietors and the whosy who's of my neighbourhood, also got rip roaring drunk with 4 ol' chaperone daddy-os&nbsp;showing me round. I finally learned the Watusi, yup, a 50 someol man taught it to me. They were completely hilarious, imagine&nbsp;4 old dudes&nbsp;doing the Watusi in this Sushi bar....   Infact, if and when&nbsp;you ever come back, I am sooo taking&nbsp;you to this place. Authentic Japanese screened rooms, whoowee. It gave me that nostalgic vibe, coulda been the lounge singer, could of been the Grand M, or could have been that real gone bartendress with a gorgeous cleavage - kept calling her dizzy spell, and she was awfully attentive. Hmmmm, I like attentive women serving me Grand.  Saturday was the most perfect day. Hung over sicky sick and all, spent the morning writing - then went out shopping for records and used books. Bought another Animals album, a Gershwin Lady Be Good! album, Jefferson Airplane cd, found Steppenwolf by Hess,&nbsp;new beautiful black with gorgeous pearled inlay design on the&nbsp;front diary, &nbsp;new record player grounding wire, but then I broke my stylus, grrrrrrrr. Now I have to wait. Oh well.  Still beautiful and wonderful, I went and had a leisurely 2 hour breakfast at the diner, read the paper, strolling round went got more groceries. Bought honey, mmmm, take this new way home - see the convent up close, wowie zowie, and look up, run straight into Sukia, who I had just emailed the day before to ask about some photos I'd like her to take. her number was out of service, and turns out the email address I had for her was wrong too. Coincidence? I think not. Spent an hour catching up with her, she says she'd be more than happy to do the photos. Also said that R wouldn't give her my new number. Jerk off.  He's fine. Really. It's a little tense, but we maintain that we are friends. i had to tell him to stop phoning me 3x daily - get to the point and all. He's still doing my framing so .... he seems to think I'm going to have a sell out show. That would be cool. Not that I'm boasting. I haven't a clue how to price my own work. I think I'll go high or go home. And besides, the point is to show the work. Regardless of how it does.   I've been asked to exhibition downtown too. We shall see, I gotta keep up with the demand!! I love it, and I'm just starting out too!! I worked last night on a new poppy for la vie en rose series. I've never really been into pink, but this series is coming out all pink and feminine. Hmmmm maybe I'm feeling pink too. When I' m done ala cafe here I will go back home and work on it. I like it when the people in their hotel rooms watch me painting in my bedroom, makes me feel tres french.  think I might go&nbsp;to that &nbsp;jam tonight, depends on my mood, screw up th' courage and play.   miss you, love b  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Then DM My Supertramp Singing neighbour is really nice. &nbsp; (I passed out after writing this) &nbsp; So Miss D, or Miss May, comes through my window as we share a tiny terrace with little lights and lanterns, and she walks right through , (it was her place prior). I was just hooking up my record player for miss Smith said she'd be by later to spill some wine.  &nbsp; I'm so blue beat and asleep on my feet. But DM insists on fixing the bamboo blinds she left me, and wouldn't stop until they were perfect. She's there admiring my things saying we have similar taste in style, and I'm like okay. I'm trying to be friendly but I''m sad. &nbsp; She offers me a rummy drink. Yes please, for the wine won't come till later, so we go through her window, and it's true. We do have similar taste in style, infact that was exactly why I took the place at all. So we're talking and she refills my drink while I tell her about RAG and she tells me about her tough luck. &nbsp; Miss Sm rings round 10 and we start to play, after I tell er bout jamming, and she's real proud of me, DM tunes up my guitars and tells me about her studio. &nbsp; So we sing and play, and trade guitars, and DM does all these pretty harmonies, which is crazy because I always hear them in my head, but I can't do everything all at once and by myself. &nbsp; And She's like "Open your eyes, I can't hear you, no don't play louder, sing louder. I will help you." She's cool, and I''m getting pissed drunk in a much better mood. 1 am I fall into bed and drop. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Sunday I practiced in the afternoon and in the eveing before showing up way too early. But that hardly mattered. I was so exhausted, I mean sitting upright with my eyes closed in a bar, trying to straighten my back against a brick wall - but it's my arms that are burning, aching, hanging from my sides. &nbsp; I sat with a 1/2 pint of apricot wheat beer - brewed right there next door and all.. I never drink beer, but well Such is Tall Sugh''s influence. I won't throw up from a kilkenny or something girly - but rule of thumb - don't ask for wine in a brewery. And they don't have strongbow or even a strumpy's in M. Drag. &nbsp; Anyway, sit alone at a table early, with guitar. I'm such a keener. &nbsp; Baby, I'll believe anything you say. And it ain't because I'm naive. &nbsp; So this two silly brit boys with shaggy haircuts come into the bar, one's got a guitar and the other is pulling at his do. They are both blond and wearing red running shoes. I think typical, and smile with an ache in my arms. &nbsp; So then it's my turn, and I've not go much in the way of experience with a mic, and I have to play buddy's guitar with a pick up, and I'm like "You figure it out" cause I'm nervouse, but I hardly know anyone more than the very nice people who had helped me move during &nbsp;the week.  &nbsp; So I tried out a little yaya, and it's all she dances in the nude, she's always in the mood, yaya wears black pasties, watchout boys cause she;s so tasty, yeah yeah yeah yeah... &nbsp; and I gotta sing up. And I'm nervous, and I fuck up mixing up my own lyrics, but I don't stop, I do it again, I could care less, I'm so tired, and how would they know anyway?  But MAN! The crowd went wild! I mean really.  I couldn''t believe it. &nbsp; But then I'd practised another song to play &amp; I played on the road instead  and I didn't even realise  I'd played a different song Till I was sitting down with the beer the bar  bought me. &nbsp; And get this... the best part was A couple A nice  normal  middle aged couple  were  slow dancing to my  song. &nbsp; That was mind blowing. &nbsp; So then I played a little lou, because everyone there likes a little lou, and I know I do. And again they clapped and cheered and I was so humbled. I haven't gotten up for no body in like 2 years or so. I thanked everyone for being so nice, because it's the first place I''ve been in where the people are nice right away. It''s a fact: the French are snobs. (I am 1/2 Fr.) &nbsp; And so I sang 5 years, and the couple danced again. How swell is that?!! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I walked along  long long  the highway  Thumb out  Goin' my way? Think fast What you gonna say?  Drive on and let me walk away?  Do wah Do wah Diddy Diddy Dum Diddy Do Where are you?  Working on it....  Arms and legs are bruised with brutal strength - yes had to haul my own couch out while the ol'man watched. 10 flights of stairs, found two Irish men to carry up that couch, some one took my butcher block... I'll speak with my landlord. He's the kind that can get it back. Mennonite made and all. Shoulda tried to carry it up atnight - couldn't even twist a bottle cap after the runs we made. Shit. I didn't think anyone would take it over night. Though it's a nice piece of wood.  Having a day off - double days of packing stacking, dragging, hauling, crawling, stalling, can't even find the strength to rip open boxes. My fingers even hurt to type. But it's almost done. Just a few more things left. And well. Tommorow, I might be less sore.   Bought myself a little expresso maker downtown. Brew my turkish in. Hmmmm cawfee. My pay cheque was double the amount I thought it aughta be, and well, I'm on vacay, so this is decent. Could be my sweet daddy found my bank in TO and gave me a little gift. I am rather thrifty so it's not like I'm gonna spend it all in one place or nothing.  Owing miss Smith, for that cab cross town, so what of it. She's so wonderful. Says she's gonna quit the scenester digs uptown and move downtown too. HOOOORAY!!  My new digs is the most!!!! Hooked up the Stereo after making a little tea in a pot on my stove, the littlest nicest cleanest working stove a june could ask for.  Smoking cigs and maman calls tells me she bought me a new a/c, cause it's so hot at the top. Love ma maman. also a new beddy by, cause I'm gonna give my single to mah gal. pretty pretty brass bed frame from maman. She wanted to paint it, I'm howling NOOOOOO! I'm gonna decape it myself, oh it's old and gorgeous. Can't wait till she comes.  First concert I ever took Maman to see was Niel Diamond. Where she almost cried with delight to see him. Second concert many years later will be Nana Mouskouri, who is playing at the end of the month. I already have my outfit planned. And maybe I'll wear my glasses. Tres enchanter!!  Oh ya, played Donavan to Christen the maddest of all pads, then a little black and blue, and then his album. Ahhhh, I can listen to it when ever I want now. No guilt, no shame, no more when he's gone, and all that jazz.  Definately my love. You should play downtown, next door. I tried to dance. My limbs were unaccomedating, I managed a spin, of delight! Put his photo on the fridge. Kissed it even. Gawd, I'm loop deh loo, I don't have to worry bout nothin no more. Come or don't it's his deal. Till I hear it from him... I will wait.  Jose has arrived now, sitting next to me. knows where I can find comet and a mop, and once I start I won't stop. Sweet sweeet sweet. Time to shop!!  Missyouloveyoubyebye.B

      It is my last night here a la bourgeois. Tonight ends my 4 year relationship. Thank god for miracles. I have been praying for as long to finally be released. He’s strong, and brave. He’s finally being cool with everything. He was insane with jealousy last night. This evening as soon as Sugh left, he was fine. Excited for a job interview with DW whatever. I hope he would get it. If it meant that he was no longer so poor and discontent - than fine. That’s all that would matter to me. I don’t want to be part of his bad hand.  And also, he was fated to be my lover. I knew this walking into it. As expressed to Sugh, “When I came home from W, I was 23 and a complete mess. I’d been on chemicals and naturals for a year and change. I went down hard. It was bad.   I needed R’s help, and I accepted all of his invitations. Summer of love 2ooo! We had been friends for many years. Since I was 17 I had loved him. 1o years to idealize a man is no small feet. To stand beside him for 1o more would have been my own resignation. My own interpretation of this relationship. I am not angry. Simply done. Simple our time had expired. I was no longer receiving any kind of stimulus, and I couldn’t be satisfied. Now I don’t feel bad about this. Certainly I feel that in our time, people come and go, walking about like armadillos.  Also my broad perception of family extends this relationship. I know that I have healed a strange and significant part of myself. I do hope to inspire AD as she is exactly who I was. Only much more supported and grounded that I ever was. This I don not fault my folks for. Simply the inexperience of their own lives. My own experience has lent itself well for the development of that 13 year old. And of course if she really does end up coming here, well, I most certainly intend on continuing my course of relationship with her.  I never fooled her into believing that I was her mother, or that she was a daughter. I knew from experience that this was a stronger relationship to pursue out of friendship with her rather than the actual bond between parents. Also, knowing that my departure is disappointing to her, and painful. I maintain that when she is 27 and dying to get out of her given situation, I will be there to bust er out.  Why? Because I am infact one of the strongest women in the universe. And so humbled.  Meanwhile, I thank everyone for everything they did, thought, prayed for and inspired me to do this. All of it. I do attribute my success for that kind of support. Directed or not, intended or not. It worked so thank you.  And God.  Whom I’m just trying to follow.  And now and now and now!!!! How many times did I hear Sugh quote me with “Ahead ahead ahead” and my muttering “Left right left” with tears in my eyes, and fear of the unknown. So thanks to Sugh for turning 3o - and having such a good time. Caribanna was the best parade I’ve ever been too. Nice folks, made me feel real good.  Sorry we had to part due to circumstances beyond our control. Thanks Sugh for always being prepared for anything, and always forgiving me for midnight runs.   This time, I walk with my head up. Through the front door with only the stuff I came into this with. Nothing less. R. Was decent about the extra stereo equipment and speakers, also I can bring the computer with me. Oh yes - thanks Sugh for the favour in a few months. Hope you can come over and program it too. Atta girl. The best kind for right hand turns. And scared skinny elbows and ankles.     Miss Smith. Ahhhh mah darlin. Found me a ride cross town. This time I’m going to lift that damn couch down those steps myself. Last time I stood behind it and kicked it with my boot to get it in as if by magic the couch could fly up the stairs. I would drag the thing if I had too.   I however assured her that I would enlist some big strong men from the bar to come and heave the heavy thing up 2o million flights of stairs. I’ll buy the beer. We can hook up the stereo after and have a party. Ruby Tuesday!  Dig Dig Do wah dum diddy, Missing the girl.  Anyhoo! Can’t wait for JAVEX. I wish I could show you my cartoon of Big Daddy and I in the Hammer, with the little caption of me saying “Gee I sure love the smell of Windex in the morning” Which I do!   Then my landlord rang the front door bell, I let it ring for a long long spell, said he’d get me a 5 gallon of white, and tints as I chose. I said “hey daddy o, I’m going to do brick in the bathroom okay? I do infact love painting bricks. If I were a man, I’d be a brick layer. I just love the idea of it. Now don’t give me radical feminist shit, I am usually considered rather sexist as a result. Just things a lady shouldn’t do. As I always say “A lady shouldn’t have to carry her own stove home.” Not to say that this dame can’t - it’s more of a doesn’t wanna. Watch me drag the couch up those stairs alone!  He was tottaly stoked. Could I do em like P.Pub, and I;m like well I don’t know, I haven’t seen em. And so and so.   Yup. I can dig it.  /

      I'm so happy! Everything is so perfect in my world, 3 months, 3 cycles, and I'm still in love.  He doesn't even know I exist. Talking to either of my girls is redundant.  They smile at me, sweetly, because they both love me, know that everything is all ri ght everywhere else in my world.  But just try to explain: yes I know I've only seen him 4 times, we don't even live in the same city, yes I know that it's crazy, but I'm in love with him, and I don't think I'm insane....  Try explaining faith to the unbe lieving and well...  I am doing my very best to maintain myself. And I was in the bar tonight - yes a new hang out, next to my mad pad,  considering I didn't spend much time doing that the last 4 years, I think it's just fine to explore my notorius and ne w neighbourhood with my best girl on her 3oth -  and ya!!! I'm single, wow!  And sure enough everyones on the watch out, and I did think the lead was a real qt - but aint they all, we're having such fun, and he's really getting into playing my song whe n h e drops his harmonica, and I just feel bad for the poor cat, way to blow daddy o,    Compairing everyone to HIM - and I just don't get it.  Why have I fallen for someone completely unknowm, who doesn't return my messages, and my - do I spend time trying to convey myself well, clearly.  I miss him so much. And I love him. And this is crazy, and I'm not. I insist.  I even got upset a little when I saw his name with Diana on the bathroom stall wall, and I'm thinking - he does have a rather unusual name...   love Mary and JAne

      all crazed about what I'm feeling. So far I want to see him outside of work. I should know better than to fall in lust, so I won't. But he does have an extrordinary large brother that you should meet. He is equally as sexy, but is as shy as you are.  "Has a jaw that could swallow your face whole." " Whoooo wee!"Said she. Already told her momma 'bout you.  Love B.

      The Dedication of the Temple - Chronicals 2:7 God appears to Solomon again Solomon's achievements The Visit of the Queen of Sheba King Soloman's Wealth  and then here's where I started..... 2:9-13 Twelve figures of lions were on the steps, one at either end of each step. No throne like this had ever existed in any other kingdom. All of King Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all of the utensils in the Hall of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomon's day. He had a fleet of ocean going ships saliling with King Hirams fleet, Every three years his fleet would return, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes and monkeys!  King Solomon was richer and wiser than any other king in the world. They all consulted him, to hear the wisdom that God had given him.  Each of them brought gifts - articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This continued year after year.  During his reign, silver was as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary in the foothills of Judah.  Trojan Rocksteady - #3 - #7 Solomon - Derrick Harriott
