      I had my meeting with the young film student on Friday and he showed me his film. I had forgotten how bad student films can be. It seems that with first and second year directors you are suppose to bore the hell out of your audience and then make them leave the theatre in disgust. I don't get it. It was like that when I went to school also (almost 20 years now).  It was just so sad to see that colossal waste of time and money. They shot this horrible thing  in Anamorphic. It would have been a waste of time on video let alone the expense of film.     I am still in the process of closing down a business. This takes up most of my time. One of the reasons for starting this blog was to connect with the image gathering community. It's kind of tough to do when you don't have any new images. I will be rectifying this shortly and amaze everyone with my image gathering prowess, but for now I am still fighting with lawyers and bankruptcy and the usual depressing spiral of events that go along with this activity. I say usual but I don't really know, this is the first time it has happened to me.    I was glad to see Lance win the Tour. It was a lot of fun keeping up with the daily coverage. Now, however I have to try to reconnect with my baseball team, The Detroit Tigres. I don't have any entusiasm yet for the sport. I need another day or two to calm down from all of the bicycle racing action.

      Good Morning,    I am having lunch tomorrow with a fellow who recently graduated from AFI. I graduated from the same institution in 1986.     He is $70,000.00 in debt. He has a reel from his school projects and he has no possibility to find work in his category. He wants some advice from me.    Talk about a struggle. There aren't any good answers or rather easy answers. The next 10 years if his situation is like mine will be very frustrating.     I will keep working on what I'm going to say and post the results. Maybe I will come up with some blistering insight between now and tomorrow.

      Nothing to report today. I am in the process of liquidating a business which has made it hard to get going with my "normal" routine.     I have been a fan of the Tour de France since Greg Lemond back in the 80's. I have converted my wife into a raging Lance and Tour fan. We are having a ball keeping up with all of the stats and enjoying the good coverage on OLN.     Thanks for your patience as I sort out what I'm trying to accomplish here.     Till next time.    Mike

       Two nights ago I watched "The Station Agent". If your are in the mood for a quiet movie that's upbeat and engaging, check this out.     Last night it was Russian movie night and I watched "Cuckoo". This movie takes you back to the Finnish Russsian conflict during World War II. Three people who can't communicate with language two of whom are enemies must get along to survive. The way the director moves through this material is truly inspiring. The movie is also beautifully shot, the camera never stops moving but it is not extemperaneous, it moves with purpose in developing the story.
