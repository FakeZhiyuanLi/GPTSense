        I have to say, it's been a good day for Baseball. First, and  most importantly , the Yankees won again behind the great pitching of El Duque. It's amazing what good pitching will do for a team. The boys are on a roll and life is good!   Greg Maddux got his 300th win today. Good for him. I don't mind the Cubs winning. It's kinda cool to be able to watch Nomar play for a decent team. I'm glad he's out of Boston so I can root for him, not against him. (Unless they get lucky enough to face New York in the series this year, of course.)    Speaking of the Yankees next opponent in the series, right now it looks like St. Loius is the best in the N.L. They don't seem to have any weaknesses. Now Larry Walker is a Cardinal. What are they trying to do, score 15 runs a game?    And what's up with Texas? Losing twice to the Orioles. I don't really like Texas. I'm just in support of any team that will keep Boston out of the postseason and they are currently ahead in the wildcard. I don't think my heart could take another Yankees/Sox postseason series.

          These are some things I just don't get. This may become a regular theme because daily I find myself wondering..........  - Being a fan of a baseball team other than the Yankees  Of course this would be first on my list! Let's face it, there is the New York Yankees and there are 29 other teams trying to live up to their standard.  - Those super sized pants  I see a lot of younger people wearing pants so big they are walking down the street holding them up with one hand. What's the point of that? It can't be comfortable. It doesn't look good and it sure looks inconvenient having to hold them up. Usually they are accompanied by a super sized shirt that has to be raised so they can hold onto the pants.  - Those Giant Platform Shoes Women Wear  I cringe every time I see a teenage girl trying to walk in those shoes that have 5 – 6” soles. They look like they are going to fall flat on their faces. Very few women can wear these things gracefully. Is this one of those recurring fashion items from the 1970’s? I was too young to notice it then, I guess.   - Bill Clinton  Aside from the obvious character flaws that a lot of people choose to ignore, this guy is kinda stupid too. I bet if I was holding the most powerful and prestigious office in the world, I could figure out that you can’t really escape scrutiny. Besides which, Monica Lewinski? Sheesh. What bugs me the most is, this guy is still hanging around the spotlight making big bucks. Let’s see, he was caught lying. He was disbarred. He brought great embarrassment to the country. He was impeached. The American selective memory loss in action?  - Genuine Rednecks  I think it must be easier to be a redneck. You don’t have to bathe regularly. Haircuts and shaving are optional. Don’t have to treat women with respect. ("Shoot, ther only good fer one thang anyways!’) Don’t have to have a good command of the English language. All you have to do is ‘Be proud to be a Redneck!’ Also, patriotism is a must. Defending the trailer park at all costs is the biggest priority.  - Modern Art  Not long ago I went to the National Museum of Art in Washington D.C. (It’s one of my favorite places.) I was in the Modern Art section and there was this huge painting (?) that took up a whole wall, and it was all white. There wasn’t anything on it. Just a very large canvas painted white. The tour guide (I wasn’t in the tour) actually stopped the tour in front of this white canvas and gave a 5-minute soliloquy on it. I’m an art lover and I try hard to understand any form of expression, but I think I missed the boat on this particular item.  - Modern ‘Lingo’  Like Gangsta , Ho, Fly and Tight. Not long ago being a gangster or like one was bad. So was being a ‘Ho’. Now guys are looking for Ho’s. Sometimes they say hookers, too. Fly? I have no idea what the origin of this one is. Recently I walked by a couple guys at work and they told me my new shirt was ‘tight’. I didn’t wear it again until I found out that it was a compiment.

        I just heard that Rick James has passed away. Bummer. There was a unique individual. No matter if you are a fan of his music or not, (And how could you not like the song 'Super Freak?)you know without a doubt there was only one Super Freak. R.I.P Rick.

        I agree with the anonymous posting concerning prayer in schools. That brought this to mind. It was sent to me by a friend a while ago. It's a bit long, but does make you think.      Dear God:     Why didn't you save the school children at . . .     Moses Lake, Washington 2/2/96     Bethel, Alaska 2/19/97     Pearl, Mississippi 10/1/97     West Paducah, Kentucky 12/1/97     Stamps, Arkansas 12/15/97     Jonesboro, Arkansas 3/24/98     Edinboro, Pennsylvania 4/24/98     Fayetteville, Tennessee 5/19/98     Springfield, Oregon 5/21/98     Richmond, Virginia 6/15/98     Littleton, Colorado 4/20/99     Taber, Alberta, Canada 5/28/99     Conyers, Georgia 5/20/99     Deming, New Mexico 11/19/99     Fort Gibson, Oklahoma 12/6/99     Santee, California 3/5/01 and     El Cajon, California 3/22/01 ?     Sincerely,     Concerned Student -------------------------------------------------------     Reply:     Dear Concerned Student:     I am not allowed in schools.     Sincerely,     God ------------------------------------------------------- How did this get started.... Let's see, I think it started when Madeline Murray O'Hare complained she didn't want any prayer in our schools. And we said, OK... ------------------ Then, someone said you better not read the Bible in school, the Bible that says  "thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbors as yourself," And we said, OK... ----------------- Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem. And we said, an expert should know what he's talking about so we won't spank them anymore... ------------------ Then someone said teachers and principals better not  discipline our children when they misbehave.  And the  school administrators said no faculty member in this  school better touch a student when they misbehave  because we don't want any bad publicity, and we surely  don't want to be sued. And we accepted their reasoning... ------------------ Then someone said, let's let our daughters have abortions if they want, and they won't even have to tell their parents. And we said, that's a grand idea... ------------------ Then some wise school board member said, since boys will be boys and they're going to do it anyway, let's give our sons all the condoms they want, so they can have all the fun they desire, and we won't have to tell their parents they got them at sch ool. And we said, that's another great idea... ------------------ Then some of our top elected officials said it doesn't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs. And we said, it doesn't matter what anybody, including the President, does in private as long as we have jobs and the economy is good... ------------------ And someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then stepped further still by making them available on the Internet. And we said, everyone's entitled to free speech... ------------------ And the entertainment industry said, let's make TV shows and movies that promote profanity, violence and illicit sex... And let's record music that encourages rape, drugs, murder, suicide, and satanic themes... And we said, it's just entertainment and it has no adverse effect and nobody takes it seriously anyway, so go right ahead... ------------------ Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, classmates or even themselves. ------------------ Undoubtedly, if we thought about it long and hard enough, we could figure it out. I'm sure it has a great deal to do with... "WE REAP WHAT WE SOW," ------------------

        Yesterday evening I was upstairs hanging out with my buddy Pauley and I noticed my neighbor coming back from getting her mail. She was holding an envelope up toward the sun trying to see through to the inside contents. She stood outside for a while doing this then opened the envelope and walked inside reading whatever it was.   I found this to be very funny for this reason, I've done the same thing several times. I'll try hard to see what's inside something for several minutes until it occurs to me that it   is   my mail, I   can   open it. Sometimes simple things like that can make me feel like a dolt. But it is funny to me.

      Well, Missouri has passed a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. 70% of the voters were against it. I didn't know until this passed and the story was everywhere, but 37 states have laws against gay marriage. Huh. This will become a huge issue, I believe. And soon. On one hand, the majority of Americans, given the chance, will vote against it. Let's face it, gays are a minority group. They are outnumbered. On the other hand, left to some of the more liberal court judges and/or overly ambitious city mayors, legalization of gay marriage would be a reality in many places, against the wishes of the majority.    I question the morality of not allowing the gay and lesbian couples that are in committed relationships the same rights allowed to heterosexual couples. I believe that marriage is the union of a woman and a man. But I don't believe that gay couples shouldn't have the same rights as heterosexual couples. First, anyone who thinks a person can only fall in love with a member of the opposite sex is just kidding themselves. Second, isn't it being quite judgemental of anyone to say 'You two are weird, so you can't possibly have the same needs as us?' Remember, 'judge not, lest ye yourself be judged.'   I can't accept the idea of gay marriage, but I believe wholeheartedly in gay couples having the rights afforded heterosexual couples. For me, it just needs to be called something other than marriage. Civil Union or something.  You see, I think many people are afraid of change and that leads to over-reaction. Sometimes it's just the terminology that can be the downfall of an idea.  But let's face the truth, gay rights are coming. It is inevitable. People have rights as human beings. The times are changing, for some too quickly, but we need to keep some traditions. Let's leave marriage as it is. Create a new tradition instead.

      Does anyone actually like the way the modern media operates? For instance, here in Baltimore there is one of the greatest swimmers ever, quite possibly the best ever named Michael Phelps. I hope he wins all 8 gold medals at the Olympics and sets a few new records to boot. (Breaking his own records in the process.) But all the hype is driving me nuts! Constantly in the news, every medium, are stories about his past, present &amp; hopeful future. His endorsement deals, his coaches, his routines, his training schedule and methods, interviews with kids at swim meets, his underwear size and brand. (Just kidding. That may come soon, though.) Now his family is in the spotlight. Actually, this is one of the better stories inside the whole hype thing, but it's just too much! Give the guy a break! He's training for the Olympics. How can he be focused on winning if there is some goober in his face asking stupid things like, 'What about Ian Thorpe?' What's he supposed to say? 'Gee, I hope he doesn't beat me?'  This is just one example. I think our media types go way too far invading people's personal space. I think the American Hype Machine puts too much pressure on individuals and sometimes helps them fail. I hope Michael is immune to the added pressure. At this rate, by the time he gets to Athens, he will be expected to win every race or some will consider it all a failure. No one can win 10 medals in 8 races, but after all the hullaballooo, isn't that what we all expect?

      So Jeff Brantley keeps saying during his Yankee telecasts that he doesn't believe in curses, but he believes in the Yankee ghosts at the stadium. His stories of being on the field in the late innings and knowing that the game was won only to have the Yankees pull out another victory are always entertaining. Last night he got to experience it again while in the booth. Sheffield saves our butts in the 9th and ARod seals it up in the 11th. The whole game was well played. One of those that you just can't walk away from. Almost felt like October. Maybe it was a preview?  And what is up with the A's and their pitching development? Where do they keep finding their prospects? If Harden is their 4th starter and he's a rookie, look out. Soon they may be the team to watch out for. (For second best, of course.)  One more thing, Olerud is very welcome in New York. I've always been a fan of his and I'm glad he's not an enemy anymore. His debut was typical John Olerud, great defense and hitting. Good to have you aboard, John.

      Well, the Yanks pitching wasn't quite up to it last night, eh? At least Jorge and Shef are continuing their great play. Kudos to Mulder, though. He's no fluke. When the boys get a lead on a pitcher like Mulder, you would hope they could pull it out. Oh well, there's always tonight...  And what's up with this John Kerry guy? I loosely follow politics around election time, just to make a somewhat educated decision when voting. But this year it's been quite interesting. Kerry says (on record) that he has a secret plan for Iraq, but he has to be elected before he can let anybody know what it is. I guess this is a good reason to vote for him? You know, the old 'I just gotta see what his secret plan is so I'll vote for him' deal.  Kerry also said (on record) that he will personally visit ALL the Muslim states and will convince them that we are the good guys, not the enemy. This is a miracle that no one in history has been able to accomplish yet. More power to him if he can. Question, why does he have to be President to pull that one off? Can't elected officials travel over there on State business, especially if they know how to save the world? I'm starting to wonder just what planet Kerry is from. I've heard of election year promises that may or may not be fulfillable, but geez! Will anyone with a brain actually buy into this one?

         I just got finished reading more stuff about the proposed new stadium for the Yankees and I have to say, I can't believe they would ever even consider such a terrible idea! Yankee Stadium is the hallowed ground of baseball. Either before the renovations in the 70's or after there have been more 'moments' at the stadium than anywhere else. Who could even consider digging up the ground where Joe D. and Mickey and the Babe stood to make history? More recently, how about the heroics of Aaron Boone, Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill, Bernie and Mo? It's such a shock to hear any Yankee thinking that a new stadium is OK let alone to have the Yankee front office actually move ahead. George, we've forgiven you for many things in the past, (most of the 80's, as a matter of fact) but this move would be unforgivable!

        So the Governor of N.J. quits, admitting he had an affair with a man. Shocking? Maybe. I'm more curious as to why government officials always seem to quit their jobs when something controversial happens. They're not actually heading off the controversy at the pass, so to speak. Maybe someone can help enlighten me as to how this story affects his job performance? I just can't see what the big deal is. I wouldn't just quit my job because of something in my personal life. Maybe he did something during business hours and he doesn't want it to be public? He's 'out' anyway, so what more is there to be afraid of? (Now I wonder what hours Governors keep. Probably long hours.) I don't get it.

        Well if there was any doubt about Orlando Hernandez it has to be gone now. The guy is still undefeated this year. Granted, 5-0 isn't a world of wins, but the way he's been pitching reminds me of 1998. Looks like the health problems are past? Let's hope it stays that way. We all know his record in the post season.   Winning 2 of 3 in Texas is big. Even though they've been OK in recent years, I still hate to see the boys go to Texas. I guess it's left over feelings from the Johnny Oates years when they had such a hard time winning there during the regular season. (Of course, post season play is a different matter.)  Besides all that, I love to see them whip Scott Erickson. The only time I ever got to Yankee Stadium he was pitching for the Orioles and beat the Yanks 4-0. Yes indeed, I hold grudges. Like these: I'm still still not over the Angels series. Still not over game 7 against the Diamondbacks. (Mo on the mound with a lead in the 9th in game 7 and still not winning? Still freaks me out!) Still not over the Marlins series. So many chances, so little execution. Some day we'll get the payback required to help forget these unnatural occurances.  Forget? Maybe.

        I bet this has happened to everyone. You're cruising along in the morning, half asleep, doing your customary cruising speed when you run into a large grouping of vehicles going slower than you want to. Thoughts come rushing through your mind like, What the..?.., Get out of my way! Finally you're able see around the vehicles ahead. A police officer is cruising along at the posted speed. Your frustration boils over! How dare he get in your way! How dare he drive the speed limit and back up traffic like this! Geez, I might be late!    This is the way this morning started for me. As I had the extra time, I began to think about how the 'good' start to the day is heavily predicated on being able to break the law and get away with it consistently. For most of us, our timed schedule in the morning relies on getting away with speeding. We don't alter our schedule to allow for driving the posted speed. That would mean getting up earlier, being more motivated earlier, being concerned about the cost of a speeding ticket.  I guess this extra time to think and ponder possible consequences could make us better citizens? Maybe I should be grateful to the police? Welcome to the morning commute.

      I've come to believe that being a lawyer is pretty much like being a terrorist. I don't like to generalize because I know the majority of them are  probably  OK. But no one wants to hear, "I'm calling my lawyer!" Everyone is so afraid of being sued these days. Many have a hard time functioning. Doctors are leaving the profession due to malpractice insurance costs going so high which is due in part to opportunistic lawyers getting rich on others misfortune. Teachers can't discipline students for fear of being taken to court. Check out the news. There are many other examples of things such as these.  How about these class action suits we keep hearing about? The so called beneficiaries of the awarded money get meaningless amounts of change after the lawyers collect their fees, which usually amount to very large amounts of change. I received something in the mail about one of these class action things last year where all I had to do was send in this form confirming I was one of the 'injured parties' and I could receive my $1.72 award. Wow! I have to wonder what the lawyers fees were, though.  And all the frivolous lawsuits, like the guy in Boston a few years ago awarded thousands from a bicycle manufacturer because he was hit by a car while riding at night, but the bike didn't come with instructions stating that you should have lights on at night. Duh! And the famous McDonald's coffee is too hot lawsuit. Geez! (Remember on Seinfeld when they made fun of that one?) I wonder if I can sue now because I think the coffee isn't hot enough? Now fat people-oops! overweight people are suing MickeyD's for making them fat. Please! Do McDonald's workers really drag people in and force feed them? I kinda doubt it.    We have gun manufacturers being sued for people using their products to hurt others. Cigarette manufacturers paying through the nose for people deciding to smoke. Strangely, there hasn't been any attacks on beer/liquor manufacturers (that I've heard) even though alcohol is the most abused drug there is. The point is,  people decide on their own  what to do with the different products available. Lawyers just help them to believe that the end result of that usage was someone else's fault thereby giving them a chance to be rich.  This is the age of no responsibility. The people have spoken and they say everything that happens is someone else's fault. They say they can't be held responsible for things they do and, damn it, they've got the litagation papers to prove it! What's worse is, the judges and/or juries have been agreeing with them!  Soon we will be at a point where we need laywers for everything, just to feel safe about going out at night. Maybe that is their secret plan! I remember in the movie Americathon (A supposedly futuristic America movie starring John Ritter) when the guy was trying to pick up the girl in a bar and there was a lawyer on call to negotiate the 'pick-up'. It was a pretty funny scene, but what if it would be real? You may be able to sue someone soon for hurting your feelings just by not saying hello on the street. That could be misconstrued as you creating an uncomfortable situation for someone else. We have been taught that that is a big no no. Scary thought, eh? And being afraid is what terrorists want, isn't it?

        Well, yesterday wasn't the day. The Yankees didn't get the sweep we were hoping for, thanks in part to 2 errors. (Note: Lofton in right field?) Loaiza still isn't solid. Looks like the bullpen/long relief is in his future? Could be if Lieber continues his streak. No complaints, though. If we continue to win 3 out of 4, this will be a pretty good year. Look out tonight. Kevin Brown is pitching in Texas. Should be a good one.   How about Texas. The Orioles whipped them pretty bad. Their weakness (pitching) sure has been showing up lately. Not to mention the change in the Orioles since Ray Miller was brought back. If the O's keep rolling like this, hello wildcard. I hope so. I'd love to have the Yankees play them in the postseason. I'm no O's fan, to be sure. But there are some guys on their team I like. (Roberts, Lopez, Palmeiro, Surhoff.) Besides, I work within sight of Camden Yards. The Yankees knocking Baltimore out of postseason would give me serious bragging rights. That would be fun.    One more thought. For the future, watch for Tampa Bay. They are young and good and will only get better. Lou will make sure of that.

        Well, Monday is here again in all it's glory. Monday definitely has a feel. Remember the Seinfeld episode where Jerry, Kramer and Newman were in the car talking about the feel of different days of the week? ("Tuesday does'nt have a feel. Thursday has a feel.") Everyone agrees that Monday has a feel. Except maybe Lottery winners. I bet every day seems like a weekend to them.   Monday is harder after a good weekend. Especially when the weather is good. (Like today.) I hate to waste such good weather working. There are lots of better things to do on a day like this, like a ballgame, maybe?   I've noticed that you don't hear anybody naming their kids Monday. I've heard of people named after days of the week. Remember Tuesday Weld? I think someone on The Adams family was named after a weekday. I can't remember which one. But a kid named Monday? What a complex they would have. Every time she/he walks into the room, everyone would be bummed out.  "Oh, here comes Monday again." Probably not a good idea.

        I've been in one of those nostalgic state of minds lately as I'm wont to be and so I decided to look up an old friend to see what was up. My friends and I followed a band years ago in which 2 of our closer friends were members, NV. Bring back any memories, especially you JH? Well, the friend I was wondering about happens to have her own website and has progressed in the music business to the point of recording her first CD. Her name is  urlLink Lana Spence  and she is a fantastic singer. (Click on her name to see her website.) I highly recommend her CD. I don't need to hear it to know that it will be worth having. I ordered it via this website -   urlLink http://www8.mawebcenters.com/crackinthedoor2/productCat40062_1.ctlg  -  The link on her site is out of stock. If you like blues based music and great vocals, don't hesitate to get this CD. Trust me. Lana doesn't disappoint.

        Last night was awesome! Not the bullpen, which had an off night and tried to give the game away, but the boys came back in true Yankee style. Never give up. Never quit.  Sheffield is the MVP of the league. Who can dispute that? Sure is good to see A-Rod back, too. This team is so exciting. You never know what will happen. You can't stop watching before the last out. Give them one more out and you could pay for it. Matsui is still coming through in the clutch. I love it best when they beat someones closer. Very satisfying!  I think the only worrisome area is that the bullpen looks a little tired at this point. The dog days of August are here and fatigue sets in. But come September and October, they will be pumped. Hopefully the rest will come for them in late September.  I love this quote:"I just [stunk] today," Quantrill said. "I didn't get my job done, and that's the only reason the game was in jeopardy." (See the  urlLink Yankee  website) You just have to appreciate that kind of honest assessment.   For the dog days, I've broken out The Secret Weapon. My lucky Yankee shirt that I used to wear every Friday, without fail, during the 1998 & 1999 seasons. It's not quite dark blue anymore. It keeps needing repair around the NY emblem and shoulder emblem, but it never fails the Yanks, so I'll nurse it through the remainder of the season. I know for sure that stuff like my lucky shirt will help the team (don't we all know lucky charms work?), so I'll be pitching in a little extra from now on.

        I have been wondering how people choose names for their children. Sometimes you hear someones name and you wonder WTF? Other times you feel like someones name really suits them. Most names are kind of 'just there'. I know you can't predict what kind of personality the kid will have, but how do you choose a name? Do you pick one hoping for a certain personality type or do you just pick one because you like it?   For example, I have a friend named Susie. Susan is her given name, but everyone calls her Susie. Her name makes me think of a happy, bubbly, fun person. The 'life of the party' kind of person. It definitely suits her. Another friend I have is Jamey. That name makes me think of a laid back, everythings cool, everybodys friend kind of person. Definitely suits him.   But what are people thinking when they name their kid something like Blanche? When you blanche at something, doesn't that mean it has grossed you out? I think you can blanche veggies, too. (Whatever that is.) And how about Agatha? Brings to mind a mean old spinster. I can't stand flower names either. Rose, Daisy etc..... Those seem like a cheap cop out. Easy to pick. And now we have kids names Dweezil, Apple, Star, on and on......   I think you have to be careful when naming someone after a famous person or something. Like the name Steve. Makes me think of Steve McQueen, one of the coolest guys ever. I know two people named Steve, but they sure aren't Steve McQueen. One is cool in his own way, but the other is no where near cool. The name Eddie makes me think of Eddie Murphy. What if the Eddie you meet isn't funny?    Then there are the goofy associations you get from names. Charles makes me think of Charles from MASH. Remember Seinfeld talking about naming a kid Jeeves? I've never met a Jeeves before, but I'm sure most are Butlers. I'd like to meet a person named Gilligan. I've seen these: Russel Sprout, Ramsey Cox, Amber Glass, Valen Tine, Sunday and Summer Street, Robin Banks, Al Duerr (pronounced do-her), I knew someone named Mary Treat, her middle name was Love. I'm not making these up. These are all real.   I don't believe a name makes a person, but I think a name that suits someone is a neat coincidence. I used to think my name was lame, but now I'm not so sure. I'm a Gemini, one of those people with 2 personalities inside. (I've been told that this definitely suits me). My name goes along with that idea. Bob. B-O-B See, you can't tell if I spelled it forward or backward, can you?

        Has anybody ever listened to the lyrics from 'Return To Sender'? The guy in the song has a fight with his girl and sends her a letter to apologize. Not just once does he send it, mind you, but several times. Then when he gets it back unopened again, he decides to take it to her and "put it right in her hand."   Now ladies, how impressed with this guy would you be? He not only writes a letter to apologize but he keeps sending it through the mail over the course of several days. Worse yet, she obviously lives nearby, because he decides to deliver the thing personally. Why wouldn't he just go visit right away and take his lumps in person? If you send something through the mail or by 'Special D', it ought to be flowers or candy or something. What a dope!  Now I guess you're wondering why I'm writing about this. It just popped into my head and I felt like getting it off my chest. That's all. And sometimes that's all there is to a rant.  Well, thank you very much.

      .....or the continuing saga of the morning commute.....  Today we find our hero, The Highwayman, cruising along at his customary 10 mph above the speed limit, cruise control locked on, when suddenly he spots an obstruction in the path ahead. As he approaches the obstruction he starts to realize it is one of the many arch enemies of the highway, rolling roadblock guy! There he is, cruising in the fast lane going his usual 5 mph below the speed limit. With his customary calm, cool demeanor our hero uses his turn signal and attempts to enter the right lane to blow past the evil rolling roadblock guy, but alas, the enemy has anticipated his move and at the last second he quickly switches lanes, barely ahead of the Highwayman. With a bit less of his customary calm, cool demeanor, Highwayman quickly swerves back into the left lane and proceeds on his merry way.  A very short time later our hero notices something odd. In his peripheral vision, he can see the evil rolling roadblock guy easing his way ahead in the right lane. Glancing quickly over he sees the error of his earlier assessment, this is not rolling roadblock guy. It is actually Speed Racer reincarnated, driving his super-duper Kia sedan. (The coffee hasn't kicked his brain into gear yet. This explains our hero's error.)  Lesser drivers would be filled with fear and frustration at this development, but not the Highwayman. He's just confused as to where this Speed Racer guy has gotten his driving credentials. He knows his cruise control is locked on and functioning at maximum efficiency, so he simply proceeds on, straight ahead, steady course. This seems to aggravate Speed Racer, as he begins a routine of speeding ahead then slowing down and falling behind, seemingly in an attempt to block the Highwayman from moving back into the right lane. Strange tactics, to be sure.  Seeing his exit on the horizon, the Highwayman takes advantage of a momentary lapse by his enemy and makes his way into the right lane to exit. The feat accomplished, he begins to exit the highway. As he does so, Speed Racer passes by with a look of utter disappointment in his eyes. He has failed to thwart the Highwayman's successful commute.  Once again our hero has survived the morning commute. Once again he has vanquished another evil highway fiend. (See the previous 'Morning Commute' post.) Tune in again next week for the continuing saga of the morning commute to find out what evil the Highwayman will face next.

        Well, last night sucked. (Have I mentioned how much losing sucks?) But there are usually highlights, even in a loss. Gary Sheffield is the most consistant hitter the Yankees have. Whether winning or losing, he will come through. Another homerun for Shef. Another reason for MVP consideration. A highlight play for Matsui, robbing Hunter of a homer, (payback for all those he takes away) and Bernie breaking up the no-hitter in the 4th, two more reasons for solace. Tonight Moose returns (finally!) and it's televised on ESPN. Something to look forward to.   Looks like the Orioles are playing themselves back into mediocrity again. The A's are making them look pretty bad. Now they lost Roberts and Hairston to injury. (Hopefully not serious. I hate to see injuries, with the possible exception of Boston players, depending on who.)   And how 'bout Teixeira hitting for the cycle! Just once I'd like to be watching a game where someone does that. It's got to be exciting.   Bonds hit 2 more homeruns last night. It amazes me how few opportunities he has to swing, but how well he takes advantage when he gets the chance. He is a great hitter. I'm not a big fan, but you have to respect his ability.

      More of the stuff that I don't get.....  - Those big shiny balls on pedestals that people put in their yards.  What the heck are they for? Maybe a signal to the alien ships overhead?  -Beatles Fans  The Beatles music is the most boring ever. What prompts people to like them so much? I do like a few (very few) of their songs, but for the most part, I can't stand them. I'm told that their success is mostly due to the era they emerged. I can see that. But look at their solo careers. Paul was still boring, especially after Wings. John was the worst. The most interesting guy is Ringo. Check out the movie Caveman. It's great.  - Excessive body piercing.  The eyebrow piercing looks painful, but not too ugly. The nose piercing is just strange. Isn't that a booger catcher? The tongue one seems dangerous. If that thing comes loose and is swallowed, you could perforate the stomach. (Maybe it's more secure than it seems?) The belly piercing is very sexy. My personal favorite. (On a woman, that is.) The boobs, well that just looks uncomfortable. As for the genitals, I think those are the most dangerous. Certainly during a passionate moment, you don't want to get poked by a metal object. (I mean an unplanned poke, for you kinky folks.)    -Those little cars with the funny sounding mufflers.   There are a lot of these things roaming the streets. You can tell when you are sitting next to them at a stoplight. They seem to be bubbling, from the sound. When they accelerate, it's like the thing breaks wind to get started. Fart and start, I guess. They just sound like the muffler is bad. Along with the muffler, a lot of these cars have one of those home-made looking spoilers/wings (whatever) attached to the trunk. They look like someone made them in their basement and screwed it onto the car. Some are at least a foot higher than the roof. Weird.

      OK, so I call my dealership where I bought my Olds to find out if my heater/air conditioner fan is covered by my so called 'bumper to bumper warranty'. When I bought this car, the special deal was that a 5 year/60,000 mile warranty came with it. It was some promotional thing Oldsmobile was doing for one month back in 2001. Sounded good to me at the time. But of course, the fan isn't covered. In actuality, almost nothing is covered. I've had the car in several times for service and nothing has ever been covered. (And this car has needed some service, believe me!) The only thing this warranty has ever been good for is a $4.00 flasher for the turn signals that went bad. I guess I was suckered by the sales pitch. I should have known that any car made in the US won't have great backing. They are just too expensive to produce. (Unions are the big cause, but that's a rant for another day.)  My second car is an import. German. The warrenty   is   'bumper to bumper'. I've had 2 and both have been so well serviced, it almost doesn't seem real. The first one had a volume button on the steering wheel that became slightly discolored, so they replaced it. Once, the brake light on the dash came on and when the service guys checked it out, they said the brakes were below their standards, so they replaced them. Brake pads, rotors and sensors. No charge. The car had 42,000 miles on it and they replaced all that, no charge.  We, the USA, are supposedly the producer of some of the finest goods in the world. If that is so, why can't our manufacturers first - build reliable products and second - back them up with decent service? It kinda sucks to think that I probably won't be buying any more new American built cars again. I've been a GM driver for a long time. But what's the point of putting my faith in something that even the builder doesn't have enough faith in to want to back it up? No thanks.

      Last week my Uncle had a minor accident. While traveling along a busy narrow street, his truck mirror clipped the mirror of a van parked along the curb. He couldn’t stop right away because of the location and the amount of traffic, so he went to the end of the street, turned around and went back. When he arrived, the van was gone. (Apparently it was someone stopped at a yard sale.)  Not wanting to let this go, he went to the Police Station and told the clerk what had happened. They said they did get a report of the incident and the investigating officer was called in to interview my Uncle. During the interview, the officer said they had several ‘eyewitnesses’ willing to testify. Depending on which report he read, they either swore that the alleged hit and run driver was driving a red or green truck. Once he heard this, my Uncle took the officer outside and showed him his  white  truck. All white with some thin black body molding on the sides. The officer told him that they had actually seen him coming back up the street, but they never would have stopped him. They were looking for a green or red truck. So my Uncle told him that he must be innocent since he drove a white truck (He has since paid for repairs to the mirror, by the way.)  My question here is this, how can we rely on eyewitness accounts when something like this can happen? The traveling speed on the street in question can’t be more than 15 mph. It is too narrow and the traffic was too heavy. The witnesses swearing to the color might even have been able to run alongside and gotten a license plate number. But the ‘sworn reports’ were so far off that the police could drive right by the person they were looking for and never know it.  This incident is a minor one. What about major ones where people ‘swear they saw everything?’ Minor story, but kind of scary to me.
