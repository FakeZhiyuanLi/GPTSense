       Current Music : Jennifer Lost The War- The Offspring  Mood:  Thoughtfull  Qoute:  "Im sorry Wendy, but i just don't trust anything that bleeds for five days and doesn't die."- Mr. Garrison(on women)- South Park, Bigger, Longer and Uncut  Well it has been a long time since I have posted in any blog. I just have not had the urge to let other people in on my life, when it is nobody's business but my own. I abandoned and started my xanga many times, but now it is officially closed. I started this journal because I need a place to record my thoughts, because their are many and it feels good to write them down.   Well school is over, which is a big relief. The only thing I did not like about North Hollywood is the fact that I was not able to see my friends from Lawrence. Although North Hollywood has brought me many new friends, it just does not replace the great friends I made throughout middle school. Don't get me wrong, I am glad to be done with middle school, it is nice to get away from all of the stupidity and immaturity.   The one thing that really seems to keep me sane is Kung Fu. Everything has changed since I started, grades have improved and just my overall mood. When I am at the Shao-Lin Center, it is just like all my problems fade away, and I just concentrate on what I am doing. It is like my own heaven on earth, a sanctuary for my mind.  -Nick

       Current Music (on my iPod)  : Denial Revisited,, the offspring   Mood:  in iPod bliss   Qoute:  "Beer- the cause and solution to all of life's problems."- Homer Simpson    Well, at 9:42 this morning, I saw the fed-ex truck pull up in front of my house, the excitement was overwhelming. As you can all guess, it was my new fourth generation 20GB  iPod . The box is really cool, and the packaging is well thought out. Finaly, the moment came and i opened up the box and turned on my new  iPod . So amazing. I have loaded all my music on it, i love my  iPod  so much.    Hurray for  iPod .

       Current Music:  Come Out and Play (keep em' separated)- The Offspring  Mood:  Apathetic  quote:  "Without evil there can be no good; so it must be good to be evil sometimes too."- Satan-South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut  Well it has been a while since I have updated. It is not like anyone reads this thing anyways. Lets see, on Sunday 7/4/04 I went to a fourth of July party, and lit a bunch of fireworks. Good Stuff.   On Tuesday I went to see Spiderman 2 with Christine, her friend "Pickle", Stan, 2 of my friends from Alaska, Jeremy and Justin, my sister and her boyfriend. The movie was okay kind of boring but still entertaining. After the movie, I went to my friend Tina's house and chilled there for a while. I lost track of time unfortunately and missed kung fu that evening.  Wednesday: I went miniature golfing with my friends from Alaska. That was pretty boring. A very un-evenful day.  Thursday: Slept, read 4-5 hours, ate, kung fu, shower, sleep.  Friday was a good day. I saw King Arthur, it was an okay movie, just wait until it comes out on video if you are planning on seeing it. After that i went shooting with James and his Dad. Shooting was extremely fun, but suprisingly difficult. After i got back from shooting, around 11 p.m. i watched bad santa. It was a great moviem, one of the funniest i have seen in a long time.  Saturday: Woke up, kung fu, islands for dinner. Everything was pretty boring except for kung fu ofcourse.  Well i do not have much to say today, some words of wisdom: Damn Liberals.  -Nick

       Current Music:  Battle Without Honor or Humanity- Kill Bill Volume One Soundtrack  Mood:  In awe of my new weapon!  Qoute:  "What is the point of going out? We are just going to end up here again."- Homer Simpson  Well today was a pretty boring day. Basically wathced TV and talked online. Not much to write about.  Well the highlights of my day: once again, talking to Christine and getting my new weapon. Yes, Yes you heard right, my new two hundred and fifty dollar weapon. I will post a picture if i can some other day. It is hard to describe it but i will try. It is about 7 1/2 feet tall, the top has a 1 foot blade that is shaped like a broadsword. THe botton as a very  big, sharp spear tip. The weapon weighs about 15 pounds.. It is so cool... =). Kung fu not only brings relaxation, conditioning and happiness.. but... REALLY COOL WEAPONS.  -Nick
