        Hello:  Let’s see where do I start?  From as far back as I can remember I have always been an obese person.  I remember being called “Fatty”, “Piggy”, “Oinker”, being teased about eating too much at lunchtime in school, the kids would say things like, “better keep your lunch away from Penni or she will eat it.”  Those things hurt when you are in grade school.   The clothes that were around in the 60’s for large people were not the most flattering.  Critics always said to wear stripes that go up and down not around so as to not accentuate your mid section.  And which way did the strips go on the clothes for large people; well they went around not up and down.   So we all looked like a huge tire.  And to top it off they were polyester knit.  When all the other kids were wearing cool clothes and jeans with cute shirts or sweaters I was wearing my polyester knit stripes going around not down.  I started getting somewhat thinner in Junior High (7th and 8th grades).  I was still not as skinny as the cheerleaders.  I wanted to fit in so I bought miniskirts and tight fitting shirts.  I must have looked like I was molded into these clothes.  I was afraid to bend over in the miniskirts, heck I was afraid to walk in them.  My butt was so big it nearly made the mini seem like a suggestion of a skirt.   In my freshman year of high school I started losing weight.  I was riding my ten speed bike at least 5 - 10 miles every day after school.  I didn’t eat much if anything all day at school.  I suddenly had an aversion to chocolate.  It would make me sick to smell it.  Ok I got over that eventually.  You can close your mouths now.  But I weighed my lightest during my high school years.  I ranged from 135 to 145.  I wore a size 10 to 13 depending on how it was made.  I was very curvy as well.  I had an hour glass figure if I do say so myself.  I was HOT!!!   So, you ask yourself what happened.  Well you see life happened.  I got pregnant before I left high school.  Married my husband of 11 years had a total of 4 kids in that marriage.  Never was able to lose the weight gained from those 4 pregnancies.  I tried every weight loss regimen out there, some of them twice.  I would lose 20 lbs here or 25 lbs there only to gain it all back plus some.  I tried watching what I was eating and that didn’t seem to work.  I tried to be more cognizant of when I was eating and why.  That helped me maintain and not gain anymore weight for about 5 years.  I stayed stable at 232 lbs for a long time.  Then I had a difficult time in my life and had a lot of family issues to deal with and turned to food as a comfort.  This has always been my modus operandi.  To me food = comfort.  It has all my life.  I have known this for a long time but just chose to not deal with it.   Well in 2003, I was faced with high blood pressure, borderline diabetes, heart related issues, ulcers, sore joints, achy back and decided it was time to get serious about this losing weight. A really good friend of mine, Karen Angela “Moore” Josephson, sent me a website Sanoviv Medical Institute ( urlLink www.sanoviv.com ).  There was a testimonial from a guy that had the Gastric Banding procedure and he was three months out from the surgery.  He was singing it’s praises along with Sanoviv as a facility.  I explored all the options and looked at both the Gastric Bypass and the Gastric Banding.  The Bypass is much more risky and permanent.  The Banding is less invasive and is reversible.  You can read more about the procedures by visiting this website listed below.  You can also do a search by typing in Gastric Banding or Gastric Bypass.   ( urlLink www.obesitylapbandsurgery.com )  I made a decision that I wanted the Banding.  I had to decide if I wanted to go to Sanoviv which is in Mexico or have the procedure done in the states.  I went for a consult at a hospital in Los Angeles (I will mention no names).  I was not thrilled and was to be honest quite scared.  The surgeon did not know what some of my medications were used for.  He thought my blood pressure medication was a fungal cream.  He could not tell me how many of these operations had been done at this hospital.  He did not know when the band was approved for use by the FDA in the states, which was in June 2001.  So needless to say, I decided to have the procedure done at Sanoviv in Mexico.  And it was the best decision I have ever made and haven’t regretted it.  So, on April 4th, 2004 I traveled by train to San Diego from Van Nuys, Ca.  I was met at the train station by the Sanoviv driver and we also picked up Karen, the friend that gave me this info, at the airport and then proceeded to the facility.  I highly encourage you to visit the Sanoviv website and experience all they have to offer.  I can’t wait to go back.  It was a truly up-lifting experience and one I will cherish and use in my everyday life.  Such a healing environment right on the Pacific Ocean.  Karen and I would go to bed every night with the waves crashing to lull us to sleep.  It was wonderful.  I was in such good hands before, during, and after my surgery.  Everyone was truly concerned and interested in my well being.  So, on April 6th, 2004 my life was forever changed as this is the day I had my surgery.  The procedure itself takes about 20 to 30 min.  The whole thing was under an hour.  It was truly fast and the surgeon said everything was PERFECT.  No complications whatsoever.  They take a plastic band, which has a bladder, that has a tube attached and a port on the other end of the tube, and place the plastic band around the top part of the stomach.  This makes a pouch about the size of between 8cc to 15cc depending on the surgeon.  Mine after surgery was around 10cc.  The purpose of the tube and port is if at some point you stop losing weight then they will inflate the bladder to decrease the size of the opening.  My bladder in the band after surgery was empty, now I have a 1cc fill. By the way there is NO cutting or redirecting of the stomach.  It is like a taking a balloon and squeezing it in the middle to form a top and bottom with an opening in between the two.  Just make the top part of the balloon smaller and that is my stomach with the opening going into the bottom part of the stomach where digestion is resumed as before.   The surgeon, Dr. Juan Lopez, that performed my procedure is the one that goes to the states and teaches some of the surgeons there to do the procedure.   I now have one of his prodegys as my follow up surgeon here in the states.  His name is Dr. Helmuth Billy and he is located in Ventura, CA.  That is only an hour from me as opposed to Tijuana, Mexico which is 4 to 5 hours away.   Eating has changed for me.  I no longer just decide I will eat a burger and fries in under 10 min.  I have to decide what will easily flow through the opening in my pouch and make sure the food is of mush consistency prior to swallowing.  I also have to listen to my body while eating.  It will tell me when I am full by signs like restriction or chest pains, nausea, vomiting (which I have experienced).  The vomiting will come if you do not listen to the restriction or nausea.  I don’t like to vomit so I listen.  It has taken me an hour to eat a ¼ of ½ piece of halibut and one french fry.  I just take my time and enjoy the food and the company while I eat.  Protein shakes are one way to get protein in your diet.  You can get some protein from fresh vegetables as well in the form of juices after this surgery.  Soups are good too just make sure you chew the chunks really well before swallowing.  So, I can eat just about any foods now.  I eat three meals a day and try to not have snacks through out the day.        I started fitness training about a month after the surgery.  I now walk approximately 3 miles a day.  I try to get in some weight training as well but that varies.      I have had some minor set backs along the way.  I had to have a second surgery with Dr. Billy to revise my port as it was tilted and hard to access.  So with that surgery in my past now I can focus on the task at hand which is continuing to get healthier by eating right and exercising and losing weight with this wonderful new tool I have.            Thanks and more later     Penni
