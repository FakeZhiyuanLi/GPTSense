      Did I really write last week, that you would "get used" to japanese music after  some time ? Well, seems like I've gotten used to it. Actually, I haven't been listening to anything else except J-pop the last days. But I guess that's completely normal. After all, there's just a month left until I leave for Japan.      I make progess in learning japanese signs. A very useful program for training is  urlLink "JWPce"  (Japanese Word Processor). This is a freeware program, that basically works like Microsoft Word, except that you won't have to change your keyboard's language to write Hiragana or Katakana in the program. Besides, it has a comprehensive dictionary and it recognizes Kanji. Just mark the Kana that you want to have transformed into Kanji, click on the Kanj-button and the program looks up the word.             Noriko told me that there are 41 students in my future class (26 HR). I actually don't think that this is bad at all, because that way I get to know more people and have more contact. She also said, she wouldn't know any europeans living in Shimizu. I'm really curious about the reaction of the students when I get there.   It always takes quite some time until I get a replies to my mails from Noriko. Unfortunately I therefore have no picture of my class yet. But Mr. Fukazawa now told me the names of his two sons and his daughter. Kousuke is 13 years old and is in 7th grade, Ryousuke (7) is in 2nd grade. The 17-year old daughter Rieko is going to Australia for one year from August 9 on, so I'm not going to see her when I arrive. Mr. Fukazawa also mentioned, that right now, it's 36 째C in Shimizu (about 96,8 Fahrenheit). I'm really looking forward to the summer in Japan.      On Friday we'll go to D체sseldorf to the consulate to apply for my visa. Most probably, I'm going to try my first sushi then too. There are alot of Japanese living in D체sseldorf. Every year, there is a huge event: the Japan-day. So it shouldn't be too difficult to find a sushi-bar.

      The exchange will start on  August 20 . The flight with Air France  D체sseldorf-Paris-Tokyo  will take about 14 hours.  In the last month I have been learning the Kana signs and I have been listening to alot of J-pop/J-rock. I'm trying to adopt their taste of music but it isn't always that easy since the music is really different (apart from the language). But there is a huge range of music: japanese music industry is the second biggest in the world. You get used to it after some time. I didn't learn  that  much of Japanese yet, besides some expressions and useful phrases. But not enough to have a conversation. When school is over (which will be in ten days), I will be able to fully concentrate on Japanese.  I really can't wait getting there. I got an e-mail from the daughter of my first host family, Noriko, yesterday. It was really sweet. Her English seems good enough to understand each other. She said she wanted to send me a picture of her class and friends. So I'm really looking forward to see that.  Greetings
