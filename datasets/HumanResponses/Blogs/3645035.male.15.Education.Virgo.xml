           It is an art to hide.  Do not ask how I know this, just accept it as a given variable.  Consider the evidence; clothing is considered fashionable, and artsy.  What are you doing by wearing clothing but hiding your beutifull body?  It is NOT fashionable therefore to be naked, so, why is it clothing over the generations (especially for females) has become less and less evident.  In fact evidence of clothing is extremely hard to find off of nudists or their beaches.      From this we(I) can derive nudists are never artists, and therefore artisic mediums should be witheld from them(a terrible waste of resources otherwise).  I am deeply sorry for all nudists everywhere if I have offended you, but I beg you to proove me wrong nudists.  Send me, John Molloy, all your best nudist art(I'm sure it will not be worthy of interpretation).      Where have I gone?  Back to the topic.  How NOT to be seen.       1.  Use a bush to hide behind.      2.  Use two bushes to hide behind.      3.  Use three bushes to hide behind.      4.  Do not use more than three bushes however, or nudism will ensue.      5.  Use clothing(or scars).      6.  Do not even consider other places to hide.       So there you(I) have it, the art of NOT being seen.  Please partake all non-mudists, in this art, wherever or whenever you see fit.    PS. I'll be in Italy from July 28-June 17, don't expect anything from me within that time.

      Marijuana is a devious thing in that it is omnipotent in subcultures requiring a certain lack of regard for those beings incapable of thought that refers to substance abuse as a good thing. Whoops, here comes the train of thought, last stop is the smot pokers! Among undescribable and obscene things today is the invisible presence of evidence of substance abuse in certain areas. It is clear that Ralph working at the record store is not puffing the magic dragon although the area has a distinct herbal scent. Could this have been caused by a bath soap? Methinks that a theory is in the works here. Smoke drifts skyward. People toke in dark, low places. When ganja smoke particles gain more energy the smoke becomes less dense and drifts upward. Convection applies and gives the area smoke. Could the offshoot of ganja smoke become a liquid and saturate the air in a record store? Methinks yes. This leads me to believe that numerous people die each year in Ontario as a result of drowning as a result of hotboxing too much and saturating the air with the burnings of substance abuse. In order for such drownings to occur, the air would have to be SUPER-SATURATED. It is also my theory that Buffalo Springfield was a victim of the super-saturation of air as a result of massive substance abuse. There was a death caused once when a man stuck his head inside a functioning bong. Allegedly, the fumes burned his face off. It is my belief that the air inside the bong in question was super-saturated. In conclusion, I would like to warn you that hotboxing crazy detergent marijuana may result in an undesirable pH level. In case you did not pay attention in grade 8 gym class, marijuana bought off the street contains high levels of cleaning products which are strong bases. Super-saturated air as a result of extremely basic pH errrrb smoke is hazsardous to your health in a similar way to drinking a bottle of Tide. So remember kids, stay away from drugs and wear a lifejacket when you hotbox.

      I am one.  Hopefully, all of you are too.  I have two arms, and two legs(possibly three), and two eyes.  In fact most good things come in twos.  How do I know this?  THE PRACTICLE APPLICATION OF MATH!  On the piece of paper on which I exist(the planet Earth), the number of body parts I have are tallied neatly.  1 leg + 1 leg + 1 arm + 1 arm + 1 head + 1 body = John, 2 leg + 2 arm + 1 head + 1 body=John. Wow look at that.  John is algebra(push-up fungi[disregard this set of brackets]).  Now, for as long as I exist on paper, I will continue to eat trees to sustain myself.  WHO ARE YOU TO INFRINGE ON MY ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE??? *froths at mouth*...*begins to rip pants then reconsiders and continues frothing instead*.    Trees are cut for a reason.  That reason is math.  Forget all that was said, math is evil.  Math is depleting my stock of trees.  Less trees=Less alternative lifestyle.  Math is Anti-Gay!  Math is Anti-Tree eating!  As long as math survives the ways of the courageous tree eater will be lost forever forever in the sands of the nude beach.  For when there are no trees left, math will be dead, the tree eater will again have to eat giant insects, and nudists will rule the world.  That is the plan of the Nudists, do math to destroy trees, to make the entire world a nude beach!  So remember all of you, continue to eat trees, do no math, and curse all nudists until they abandon their plans for world domination and become docile non-math doing tree eaters once again.  Thank you and good-bye.

      Deep philosophical questions have been entering my brain concerning the topic of creation of human beings. The age old question is one that I choose to tackle before your very eyes. The meaning of life?! I sat there today as I wrote the science exam and I found myself thinking about a blog comment in particular made by the right honourable Christopher Martin. He mentioned something about math being something that doesn't apply to real life. Lisa Munro made a suggestion that math is 100% on paper and does not exist otherwise. This brings me to ponder the point of our existence: Are we only existing on paper? I feel like there are two identities placed on a person. That person's physical entity is the first, but the second is much more intriguing - that person's existence in papers and on records. The world is built on a trust system. Are we put on this Earth to exist as members of society? This is what the papers that define us lead us to believe. There is the other point that we might be meant to be  living . Sometimes it seems like the right thing to revert to a more natural lifestyle among trees - to abandon what modern society has become. It makes it seem so much simpler, so much more  correct . Any way you look at it, there is a real conflict of why we are here. Why are we living this? What would we be experiencing without life? Life is a miracle now? If there is an afterlife then what happens before life? These deep philosophical questions are probably what philosophy is based on. For now, it is my belief that all people are born from the womb. We all started out as cells but did not have the capacity of thought. We do not remember the state of being a fetus just as we do not remember the day of our birth. This is an issue where various facts of science have won my beliefs.  You were a sperm once . There was no drama at that point in your life. Yes, that  was  your life. We are put on this earth to reproduce. If there was one thing I learned in biology it was the significance of  population potential , or some other similar term. It means the ability of a population to reproduce. If there is a scale that judges how well we would be able to reproduce, then is that our reason to be on Earth? Is it to carry on the species? Hormones ensure that we are able to do so, but how we go about doing so is not something biology can control.  If we cannot do so, have we failed to do what we were put here to do?  You may ponder these points, but ponder also that we were all fetus at one point - probably at the same point. Whether or not we received enough milk was as important to us then as whether or not we succeed at being "good" teenagers now. In conclusion, science seems to not have abandoned us as teenagers. There are a number of philosophies that revolve around our reason to exist, but we must let them be for now and remember that we are all transmutations of an all-inclusive cheese.

           Who knows about the rest of you, but manly advances are both welcome and valid. Or in-invalid, if it suits you(you of course could be Vincent).  In fact all of you could be Vincent.  In fact we all are Vincent.                             Item A; All passed gas is subservient to the gas that is its lord and                            master(that of Vincent Chung), and all gas passed is but echoes and                           offspring of its master.  All gas therefore is directly related to Vinny.                           Item B; All bastardizations of the English language are endearing and                           therefore are emblazoned on our psyche.  Who will forget the aforementioned                          accidental witticisms, and fun sayings(I was saying them for months.                           Item C; Vinny is thin and fit, but could be diseased(a bit to thin).  Being                          Vincent would make me personally much lighter.           Whatever you choose to beleive  I'm  beleiving me.  You could be Vincent.  Vincent..All Vincent.  Thank you very much, and please stop insulting yourself, you could embarass yourself heavily by failing to beat yourself up.

         I have come to you today to adress what is both a common threat and a common cause: the stupid kid we all love to hate, Vincent Chung.    Flashback to computer engineering class, late january. We were sitting there working on games. I had been working on one such game for about an hour, and I was proud of my Pui Yan date sim. Suddenly Vincent came up and started making manly advances on John Molloy. I did not think too much of this because it is something that happens all too often in computer engineering class. WHABAM! Vincent suddenly deletes my game. I realized that because I was a dolt I had forgotten to save it beforehand. It was at this point I swore I would kill Vincent Chung.    While we all hate him, Vincent Chung has become a legend of sorts not for his low IQ but for his carefree butchering of the English language. Allow me to touch on several recent butcheries of such a form.  " Yo guy, you are invalid!" - Vincent's point of view on the nuclear arms race.  " These terms are satisfactory." - Vincent's dramatic closure of a mythology play.  " Do you know where is Molloy?" - Vincent's desperate call for male bonding.  " Coopah is gay wif Maaaaahtinn" - Vincent's desperate comeback every time he gets zinged while I or Martin is anywhere withni earshot.     Such incidents are a disturbing dent on society as we know it being the gifties that we are. I would like to thank you, Vincent, for providing us with a model. A model of something we hope to never see again. An incarnation of what we hate about society. I would also like to say that those who are your friends do so because they do not know any better. Only a really socially insecure person would befriend a twat such as yourself. That is all.

      And I just punched the clock.  I (John Molloy) would like to start off by saying I have already made an opening statement, and will not require another one for what idealy will be some time.  I will end my first post with what should be an insightfull quote for all of you. "Go not where your feet take you, but where your pelvis thusts you."  Now on to the show(business).

      This is Chris Cooper. John Molloy and I decided to create the bastard child of giftie blogs today, and here is the result. Welcome to the Ream of Mang. This will not be any ordinary blog, mind you. This blog is for the spineless and hilarious bashing of those around us as we sit and wonder why one would suck so hard. Please enjoy as we sow our crops in the ashes of burnt-out dwellings situated in the shame of others.

NO!&nbsp; Pickle sized fairies live in coffins beside crucified cockroaches and water smoothed pebbles.&nbsp; They also inhabit space(which coincedentally has no hills).&nbsp; Do you know where to find hills?&nbsp; No, not in space.&nbsp; Weren't you listening?&nbsp; In Italy!&nbsp; Yes, that is where hills are found.&nbsp; Do you know why?&nbsp; Of course you don't, you think pickle sized fairies live in them.&nbsp; Well I'll tell you.... Some time later, I'm jet lagging. &nbsp; FIRST!&nbsp; I hope you didn't do anything to that cow.&nbsp; No, thats second, first things first.&nbsp; Cheese comes from the nipples of large overfed mammals.&nbsp; This is both gross AND disgusting, especially when coupled with aged warm feet squished grapes.&nbsp; This is why I ate Lebanese in Paris.&nbsp; Where is Leban you might ask.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; I didn't get an answer. SO!&nbsp; A contest!&nbsp; The first one to tell me where Leban is gets 0.05 euros.&nbsp; Free.&nbsp; I hope you didn...oops already said that. &nbsp; so &nbsp; CONTEST!!!&nbsp; TELL JOHN MOLLOY WHERE LEBAN IS AND GET 0.05 EUROES!!!! &nbsp; You can stop hiding now, I couldn't find you.&nbsp; Get some clothes on too, reading nude in the dark is bad for digestion. &nbsp; Bye Bye Ciao Ciao &nbsp;

      Heres how it stands, slightly crooked.  Actually a lot of things are slightly crooked.  This is mainly because of the audacity of the ground, and the wooden spikes stuck in it.  Hey, thats how things work in Italy.  If it cant be built by sticking wooden spikes in the ground, and putting huge masses of marble on them, its not worth doing.  Take Venice for example, nice dont you think?  Not so nice however when you realize the whole city is being held up by small wooden spikes in the soggy swamp ground.  Niiiiice, now everybody knows how things collapse.  Speaking of collapsing, the colloseum has.  You know why?  Some genius started with wood.  Now all we have is half a colloseum.  Its true.  Ever seen two halves of the colloseum?  If you have, you know one of them is only half of a wall.  You know Pisa?  I don't think I need to explain that one, or alternatively look slowly back down the page(a process called reading) and understand why.  Wood.  Not only the buildings are crooked, so are the shady street vendors selling "follexes" and bags by "Guchi".  Would any of you like to know why I sound bitter?  Because I've been happy since I got on the plane, I need some time to figure myslef out before the smile Im wearing engulfs my body.  Alternatively its because im drinking gasy water(thats is awefull) and lusting after eurpean buties(men+women) oops... smile getting bigger... must get angry... cant contain all happiness.  O well, being Canadian in Europe is like being Pee-Wee Herman at the movies.  We(my fam) get the absolute best deal on everything.  Aw well, here is the Schedule thus far, Been to Venice(Three Nights) Been to Florence(Three Nights) Currently in Rome(The Second of Five Nights) Next Sorento(near Pompei/Herculaneum)(Four Nights) After That Paris(Three Nights) Hmm, might have miscounted(a couple nights lost in transit maybe?)  Hmmph, be back on the seventeenth.
