      yeahp, this morning, eh. mom woke me up to tell me i was naked! (imagine that, me naked?) i was like... yeah, ok, i think i know. *rolls over*  i got a call this morning at 9.. GAG. "Is this the Huntington Mall?" "NO!" and then i realized it was mom... she told me she had just got out number changed. whoo. *soo happy* perhaps now i can sleep a little bit better.  im pathetic. i dont understand my best friend. if bryan loves me so much, then why dont we work? why is he not ready for 'us.' plus, whats the real difference? we pretty much act like a couple anyway. all thats left is the 'yeah, she's my girlfriend.' perhaps he's ashamed of me or something, i dont know. i feel uncomfortable talking to him about it. i love him more than life or anything.  but yeah, today, i need to do laundry and clean up my room and bathroom. i cant believe ive let it go this far. :-/ oh well.  i guess ill go for now. maria

      i feel so sick.. im so tired of it all. i wish id just die. i dont ever want to wake up. no one seems to listen anymore, and im going to explode... i just need someone. i tried to talk to mom today, and she just barked at me, she was so rude and nasty... she really hurt my feelings.... i cried and she doesnt even care.  i tried to go in there and talk to her about the lady at UC and that stuff, but she just blew up on me... she wont even listen... i just need to tell someone whats wrong. thats my problem, no one knows. i just need someone. im going to die like this...  when i try to tell mom about how depressed i am and how i just want to kill myself, all she does is scream to me about her life sucks and how she works hard just to put a roof over my head and how she's going to send me back to charleston.  i really think she hates me... she always ignores me.. i need a FAMILY.    i dont think ill do UC. its obvious to me ill have no future. ill probably be your drop out of everything and get pregnant deal.  well, i guess a baby is just like a souvenir that you really like sex. i just dont fucking care anymore. maybe babies would work better, something that's born to love me.    if i go back to charleston, im going to kill myself. i almost did the last time i was there.. (weekend) i wrote a letter to bryan in my journal... tucked it under my pillow and cried myself to sleep. i traced up and down my arm with my cerimonial dagger... i didnt do anything major though.. so who honestly gives a fuck? i seriously doubt anyone would even notice if i did. if i fucking died in my room dad would probably just assume that hiedi crapped somewhere and odo ban the house.  god forbid he come upstairs and try to spend time with me.  god forbid mom come in here from her godamn tv and tell me she loves me.  i just need to know that im loved, and someone WOULD miss me. i just hurt so much. id love to just crawl in a hole and die.  the only person i have is bryan.. and how long is it before that is raped from me? everything i know, love, see, am... its raped from me. my future, my love, really everything. i dont even get to see my beautiful sister grow up. ill never be there to help her along or answer her questions. ill never be able to educate her from the knowledge of my own mistakes.  speaking of siblings, im a horrible sister. i feel so bad for treating lonnie like i have all my life. the truth is, im jealous. he gets along great with mom and dad... they spend time with him and love him.. and they just seem to neglect me. my dad wont even tell me he loves me when i tell him i love him half the time. he just stares off in space. oh yeah, i feel so loved. but, i always tell lonnie to piss off.. im so horrible. he just needs someone to talk to, like i do. god, if there would become two of me in the family, i think the world would end. id hate to see lonnie kill himself because i was never there for him. its sad, i always said id never treat anyone like ive been treated all my life, but i am. im neglecting my little brother.  and i think he hates me. i'd hate me too.  i just wish that i could go far, far away. im seriously thinking about running away again. i just cant take much more of this. moms mood swings, lonliness, dads pressure and commands, christys sugary sweet fakeness, EVERYTHING. why cant it just all go away?  im surprised i havent slashed myself up yet... i may go have a cigarette. ill take back up the habit soon, im sure. its all ive been able to think about lately. i had a beer today too. whoo. it was good. wish i had another right now.. or.. 5.  i wish i really would have blown myself up today. i dont deserve this life. i dont deserve that UC program, i dont deserve the fucking bed i sleep in. im not worth the salt in my bread. maybe if id have burnt myself really bad, mom and dad would feel bad because i was ALONE and they'd actually come talk to me, something. then again, i dont want/need their fucking pity.  im TIRED of everyone telling me how beautiful i am then when i meet them, they cant stay out of my pants or quit touching me.. blah blah. i dont need that. plus, they really shouldnt tell me im beautiful, they dont know how ugly i really am.  but yeah.. i guess im done for now. hopefully soon ill have someone to cry to.. instead of myself.  maria
