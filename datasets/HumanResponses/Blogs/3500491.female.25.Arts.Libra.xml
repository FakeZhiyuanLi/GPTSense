      Ok, it's not exactly prom night, but it is Memorial day.  That means beach day.  So, of course, it's raining.  Well, it's not raining yet... but it's supposed to this afternoon.  Go figure.  I suppose today might be the last time I see many of my classmates together.  In some cases, this is  good ...  in some other cases, not so much. Either way, it's a changing point.  Man am I ready for some stability...

      There's a John Denver song that I always come back to when I'm trying to get through those really hard moments in life. It's called "Poems, Prayers and Promises" and it goes along like this:                           I've been lately thinking about my life's time,             All the things I've done and how it's been.             And, I can't help believing in my own mind             I know I'm going to hate to see it end.              I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain,             Spent a time or two all on my own.             I've know my lady's pleasures, had myself some friends,              Spent a time or two in my own home.              I have to say it now, it's been a good life all in all             It's really fine to have a chance to hang around,             And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire,              While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around             And talk of poems and prayers and promises             And things that we believe in,              How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care,              How long it's been since yesterday, what about tomorrow,              And what about our dreams and all the memories we share.    This song always makes me reflect on all the wonderful things going on and somehow I can deal with the crap.  Ironically, the first time I really listened to it was on the trip from Chicago to Winchester during the spring break of my senior year of college.  I had just come from visiting Josh and a grad school audition, which I had bombed, and the worst car trouble of my young life (Martina broke down in Gary, Indiana - shudder).  I was also facing the end of school and leaving behind some of the best times and friends I had ever had.  Similarly, my recent troubles stem from the sadness I feel at leaving NYU and my friends and classmates.  Also, I'm having some difficulty figuring out exactly what my feelings for Geoff are and what his are for me.  Which brings up the question of my moving to Chicago.  Why  am  I moving there...?  Something to think about.  I was in the process of cleaning some stuff out and throwing a lot of loose papers away when I came across an old letter from Justin Eller.  Justin was one of my closest friends at Shenandoah.  We had a very strange relationship, and though we never actually dated (I think there was one date which involved antiquing in Front Royal...) I know we loved each other very much.  He's in Iraq right now, he joined the Army to play the clarinet and pay his loans...  now he's fighting. sigh.  Anyway, I found this letter that he sent to me right when Seth and I were having real problems.  It just seemed so poignant:             "As far as [Seth] is concerned be very careful but try not to be un-needingly selfish by trying to protect yourself from a future heartache, okay?  He might be the one.  Be true to yourself and if you're ready open up to him like no other, make sense?"   It's times like this that I wish I could just pick up the phone and call Justin for a chat...

      For those who haven't heard, I quit  Beauty and the Beast .   I just couldn't do it.  No patience, if you will (my biggest curse lately).  However, right on par for my life, a new project has fallen into my lap.  YAY!  I will be playing Zelda Fitzgerald in a new musical called  Zelda .  If anyone knows anything about her, then you'll realize how much fun this is going to be!!!!!  (thanks to Quiggley for thinking of me...)

      I have a bad feeling about this...  this is bad.  This is very bad... that song keeps running through my head.  It's my new favorite thing to sing in the car.  This can only lead to no good and  someone  (probably me) getting hurt  again .    Was it bad that when I got that panicked phone call, I immediately went to the selfish place?

      Hey friends, sorry for the delay...  I have been busy,busy,busy...  The quick version is this:  Started working at the Ollive Garden, in the middle of training.  Been Teching the EMC dance concert in hanover for three days.  Yesterday drove to DC to audition for the Air Force Choir.  Tomorrow, driving to NYC to get the rest of my stuff and to have lunch with crazy Seth.  At the moment, I'm supposed to be driving to Hanover for my 11am call...  yeah, that's not gonna happen....  another full day of "don't talk please" "sshhhhh" "no tapping backstage"  "Shut up" "you know better" and "girls,  please !"  Well, I'm earning my money,  that's  for sure!

      Thank God, for Seth Morgan!  I knew there was a great reason we were ever friends in the first place... He reminded me that whatever I choose to do is the right thing and just to relax...  How nice to have a friend who is completely, altruistically supportive.

      Sorry I've been so lazy about posting.  I've just been lazy...  Things here are ok.  I'm in a weird transitional place, I'm not sure I like it very much.  The show is awful.  Aiy... oh well.    Shannon and I have been spending some quality time though which is good.  Between her and Ciara, my plans keep changing as to what I'm going to do and where I'm going to go.  I can't stay here.  That much I know.  Then there's Chicago...  I'm kind of afraid to go there until I'm totally over Geoff.  I'm afraid it'll become this huge mess, and then two of the three people I know there won't be around for me.  I haven't heard from him.  I assume he's doing well.  Whenever I think of him I get sad and then really angry and then sad again.  He practically begged me to move there...  G, if you still read this thing, drop me a line sometime.  The thing is, I might have some directing opportunities around here this fall.  It'll suck to be here, but it's work.  Shannon and I talked about the possibility of me staying here until next June and then moving with her back to New York.  Argh...  My biggest issue with that, is if I do that, I give up any chance of even being friends with Geoff.  It's sad that that's what holding me back in making these decisions.  However, speaking of friends, almost all of mine live in NY.  And now that Seth and I are back in friend mode, I'm really sad to be leaving the city.  Too many decisions.  I feel like my head is going to burst.  The last thing is that I'm considering audition for the Singing Sergeants, the Airforce Choral Ensemble, based in DC.  It was Emily's idea and I'm starting to think it's a good one.  AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  (feedback would be greatly appreciated.)  I'm going to see Maurice in  Ragtime  again.  This time it's at the Fulton Opera House in Lancaster, PA.  Not far from here.  Tomorrow is the graduation party.  I've already spent the morning scrubbing lawn furniture (jealous, aren't you).  And later, i think I'm going to the pool.  Not a whole lot going on other then the craziness in my head.  Second interview for the Olive Garden on Monday.  Auditions for the Fulton on Sunday...

      I'm home now.  I've been home for a few days, just vegging out.  Not a whole lot going on which is really nice.   Beauty  rehearsals started last night...  Oh, this is going to be a long summer...  We had choral rehearsal while the principals started blocking.  Since technically I'm both and they haven't assigned solo lines in the ensemble I decided it would be better to go to choral rehearsal.  I was most definately wrong.  I can't even describe how disorganized and wasteful our time was.  Too much time spent on things that didn't matter yet and not enough time spent on important things, like parts.  I marched right up to Quiggley and told him that I was going to kill him for bringing me and then I was going to kill myself.  Aiy... Hopefully once we get out of music rehearsal it'll be better.  As much as I love hearing from Seth everyday, I can't help but think there's something weird about it.  I dunno.  Maybe it's because I haven't spoken to him for so long and now we're making up for lost time.  I certainly don't want it to stop, but I can't help thinking that someone is going to get hurt eventually...  To make things more confusing, Quig is trying to set me up with a guy in the cast, named Seth.  freaky.

      I'm sitting amidst boxes, with packing yet to finish, waiting for my mom and Charlie to get here.  I'm leaving New York today.  Wow, am I filled with mixed emotions.  The past month has been filled with really high strung emotions and wild feelings.  It'll be good to get home.  Seth and I went out last night.  We talked about many things, most of which I'll never share here.  It's odd to think that I have this confidant out there who has been through hell with me and so I can honestly tell anything.  Being with him last night made me realize that I've been looking too hard for someone to fall in love with.  When Seth and I met, it was completely by accident, and it was so comfortable from the very first moment.  Even having not seen him for several years, it was still comfortable and familiar.  We did what we loved to do most when we were dating, we walked.   We walked from Grand Central to Washington Square Park to sit and stare at the arch and talk.  I didn't want the evening to end, even though I didn't get home until 4am.  (Nothing I'd be willing to write here can describe how I really felt about the evening.  However, to get a better idea of who this person is to me please see the entry entitled  Journey To the Past .)  So today, I'm dragging already.  Oh well...  Need to finish packing.

      It's Friday.  My last day in New York.  Sad, and yet, not.  This week has been a strange one.  I've seen more old friends then I could've imagined.  The weirdest goodbye, however, I think was Matt.  I didn't expect to feel emotional about it.  We haven't spent much time together this year.  He gave me a hug and kiss and it was the first time I felt something about leaving the city.  Today, I'm going to lunch with my friend Mike from high school. (I'm not sure that counts because he'll be near home while I'm there.) Then tonight, I'm going to visit with Seth.  We haven't seen each other in several years, though we live in the same city and chat online a lot.  It'll be a good thing, I think.  The packing is coming along.  I took my bed apart last night. It's really quite compact in pieces!

      I am so blessed to have someone like Ben for my friend.  I feel wonderful just being in the same room as him.  I hope everyone is as lucky as me.  I will probably miss him the most when I leave New York...

      So, if I had any doubts about moving across the country for some new theatrical endeavors, they have been momentarily laid to rest.  I just got a call for an interview for a directing position for September, in the Chicagoland area.    As my friend Talon would say, "MEXCELLENT!!!"

      Chris took me to see  Supersize Me  yesterday.  This is an independant documentary style film about the affects of fast food on the population of the world.  Wow.  All I can say is that I will never eat fast food again. Go see it...  In other news:  I was recently thinking about my old pal, Troy Scarborough.  He and I were in the same class at AMDA and we were pretty good friends.  After I left I lost touch with most of my friends from there, including Troy.  Well, last week I was wondering what he was up too and decided to Google him.  Turns out that he's been touring with  The Full Monty  for some time (yay!!!).  Unrelated, Ben is doing  Love's Labour's Lost  with NJ Shakes and I'm going to see it tonight.  SO, I went on the website to get directions and low and behold, I discover that my old friend Troy Scarborough is in this show with my best friend, Ben! Once again proving that, not only is it a small world in general, but that the theatre community is unbelievably tiny. (Just ask Rebecca, who got flirt with Jimmy Fallon at the Tony's on Sunday...)

      Well, what a Sunday!   Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban   I want to start by saying that this is my favorite book in the series, so far.  After two essentially similar episodes, part three offers a really interesting adventure in which the main villain,  never shows up !  In this book, the details are so carefully laid out that the reader begins to feel that the series may be much more sophisticated then originally thought.  Needless to say I was  very  excited about this movie coming out.  It was good.  I liked it.  I was dissapointed by it, as I'm sure all die-hard Harry Potter fans will be.  The intimate details that J.K. Rowling is so good at are generally glaized over to the point that I wonder if I had not read the book, would I have understood everything that happened.  In the movie, we never really learn who Mooney, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are.  I believe this is a terribly important detail to the course of the story.  Perhaps an extremely intuitive brain could put it together with the tiny shards of imformation allowed into the screenplay, however the person I went with had not read the book and didn't really understand what that was all about.  My rave through, is for the cinematogrpahy. The pictures in this movie were absolutely stunning.  I could just watch without the sound and be very content.  The new director was very successful in his craft with this story.  The other new additions to the cast were also quite wonderful, specifically Gary Oldman as Sirius Black.    Yes, I think you should go see this movie, just know it's quite seperate from the book.  And if you haven't read the book, shame on you.   The Tony Awards   Definately the most exciting Tony Awards in several years.  Highlights for me were:  Phylicia Rashad (Best Actress in a Play), Idina Menzel (Best Actress in a Musical),  Assassins  (Best Musical Revival), and  Avenue Q  (Best Musical).  It's phenominal to me to see a show like  Avenue Q  (it's a puppet show - think Sesame Street meets South Park) beat a very traditional Broadway show like  Wicked .  Overall, the awards were widespread with Assassins taking home the most at 5.  If you'oll remember,just a few years ago  The Producers  took every single category that a new musical could, and it was a rather boring event.  (And ticket sales have not been so great for that show since it's stars departed, so it makes you wonder how good the other elements actually are, or if it was other factors that led to its sweep. Remember  Full Monty  was the show most overlooked that year.)  Alright, well, I guess it's time to get on with my day.  I'm kind of waiting to see what shows post their closing notices today... I have a bad feeling about  Fiddler...  (sorry, Haviland!)

      Man, Talon's most recent weblog post and Geoff's response to it have really put me in a funk.  It generally talks about women's behavior in regard to relationships.  I can't help wondering if what's going on between Geoff and I instigated any part of that post.  The thing is that we (women) can't make adjustments, can't fix things unless men express to us through words (not telekinesis) that something is bothering them.  I know that I've always been willing to listen to anything a guy I'm dating has had to say, but the problem comes up when he won't say anything.  I can't help feeling that if Geoff had been honest with me about this last situation, instead of just assuming I could figure out what was wrong even though he wasn't telling me, I would've been able to better deal with it.  Instead, for two weeks I was left guessing and trying to put the pieces together.  It was rough, at one point I worried that he was dead.  It drove me absolutely insane.  The good news is that I'm recovering.  The bad news is that the only way I know to recover is to become cold and distant - two of the biggest complaints about women.  What to you want me to do?  Wallow in my sadness and grief until I die?  Forget it.  Yes, I'm sad and hurt, but I can't continue to waste entire days wishing that I could fix things.    So to answer Talon's question:  I can't speak for all women.  However, what I want is someone who likes me, who is willing to grow with me through the good and the  bad , because there will be bad.  Someone who understands that relationships are never stagnant, but ever changing and is willing to let go and ride the waves. Someone who can teach me things and wants to learn from me also.  Most importantly, I want someone who will let me try to make them happy.  Men have walls too.  So when I find one who will let those walls down, I'll know I've done well...    I've never been one to group all men into a category.  I've known too many, I guess.  I've met a few men that I could be willing to spend my life with.  But the thing is, it's such a careful balance to find that perfecct relationship.

      Somebody ask me how much packing I did today... go ahead, I dare you.  Oh wait... no, maybe you'd better not.   I sat on my fat ass all day.  Fantastic.  I am so ready to get out of here and spend six weeks or so in PA.   Beauty  rehearsals start next week.  I can't wait.  I'm in dire need of getting in dance rehearsals immediately.  Time to get serious about that skill I'm lacking confidence in.  Damn, I'm bored.  Someone call me and entertain me for a bit.

      I've been going through a lot of "stuff" in the process of packing.  I have found many things I'd forgotten about along the way.  One is a notebook I used to carry with me everywhere.  It has everything in it:  Phone numbers, love letters, audition information, cartoons, random thoughts.  I've had this notebook pretty much since I moved to New York, so you can imagine the stuff that's in it.  I decided not to toss it.   Another thing I found is a song that was written for me.  I'd like to share it with the world, as it comes from the absolute happiest part of my life.  A man I once loved wrote this:   I'm starting from scratch I feel so brand new And I've never been happier than when I'm with you. I stare at you silent, deep in your eyes And I know you see the me I lost in all of my lies  I could walk with you forever Each second I see something new And I'd be the happiest man in the world If I could stay right here with you.  A kiss on each corner, a walk around noon Each moment is beautiful because of you My hands are so rough, tongue ties everywhere But with one look from you I could dance in the air  I wonder just what you see When you look into my eyes 'Cause I've spent the past years convincing myself There's nothing in me but goodbyes  But now I'm with you and I hope that you'll stay To laugh with me, cry with me, share every day So, I'll hold you close and whisper in your ear: That when I breathe you in it's magic, my dear.  I could walk with you forever Each second I see something new And I'd be the happiest man in the world If I could stay right here with you.   To the composer:  Thank you for everything.  And, thank you for still being in my life, these years later...

      Yesterday I had a photo shoot with an old friend. Well, "friend" I suppose, is pushing it.  James dated my friend Melissa while he went to Penn State, and then he transfered to Shenandoah, where I was going to school.  I knew him.  We were acquaintences.  I'd have a hard time saying we were friends.    But anyway, he lives in Brooklyn and needed some headshots.  I needed the money, and hey, why not.    What bugs me is this: As we were leaving, he said, "You haven't changed one bit."  I thought, oh God.  It's been years since we've seen each other.  Have I really not changed?  I happen to dissagree.  I also happen to not want to give much weight to this person that truly, barely knows me...  So, I was just bugged by that. I'm not even remotely the same person I was in college.  At least, I don't think so...

      Tonight I saw Stephen Sondheim's  Assassins .  It was amazing.  Two things really struck me as extemely moving and unbelievably well thought-out.  The first is the use of a projector image of JFK's assassisnation onto the white t-shirt of the Lee Harvey Oswald character, just after he is convinced by John Wilkes Booth to kill the president for all the attention and notariety he could ever dream of.  The second is the idea that all these people did what they did for the love of another human being.  John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln for the love and adoration he wasn't getting as an actor.  Squeaky Fromme attempted to assassinate Gerald Ford for the love of Charles Manson. (Isn't that messed up?!)  John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan to show Jodie  Foster how much he loved her.  In the play, Oswald finally decides to kill JFK in order to win the love of friends and family, instead of committing suicide.  Love is a very powerful thing, not ever to be taken lightly.  It makes people crazy in every possible way.

      What a Memorial Day it was...  So.  Rachel and I did go to the beach.  In the rain.  We were the only assholes on the beach.  However, we played frisbee, we did cartwheels, we put our feet in the water, we did all the beach stuff one could possibly do, and then it started to pour.  So we did the next logical thing... found beer.  Since we had to wait for Matt and Katie anyway, why not.  The best part was that in Brighton everyone is Russian.  And our waitress didn't speak much English.  Very very interesting.  I guess you could say that we started drinking around 1:30 and finished about an hour ago.  I needed it to.  Especially after the damn few weeks I've had.  Then we all came back to our apartment and ordered pizza, drank, played Cranium (which should only be played with large amounts of alcohol),and watched  The Princess Bride .  In the course of the day Matt and I totally made up for all the time we won't be seeing each other in future by fighting like brother and sister, including Matt biting my hand because it was there.  Excellent.    Whatever, it's the end of the day and though I managed to get though it fairly unscathed, I'm again in the unhappy place facing hours of supposed sleep.  damn...  On a happy note, I heard back from Justin.  He's safe and happy and doing very well, even if he is in Iraq.

      It's official.  I will be sad to see this show end.  I'm very sorry that the rehearsal process was so short, because now I'm discovering new friends and it'll all be over in a few short days...  (tear) (Megan, Adam, Brian, Christy - I love you guys)  Very interesting conversation at the diner tonight, after the Triangle left.  More like a square really.  What an asshole.  While I didn't know, I'm not surprised that he's tried to make his way around the girls in the cast, and I'm curious to know why he didn't bother with me... aside from the fact that I would've laughed in his face and I'm sure he knows it.  I can't wait to get to know his  girlfriend  next month during  Secret Garden .  James mentioned something very cool about this show moving to New York, and it made me giddy to think about continuing to work on it.   It's a really smart new musical with great potential.   Even if I'm not Zelda in the next round, I don't care, as long as I'm involved.  Mucho Gracias to Quiggley for bringing me on board!!!!

      Last dress rehearsal tonight.  Technically tomorrow is still a rehearsal, but we'll have an audience, so I'm not counting it as a rehearsal.  Things that went wrong tonight:  Janna forgot to yell from off-stage, forcing me and Joel to have to kiss until  someone  covered for her, I forgot to put on the engagement ring for the scene in which I'm supposed to give it back and then Joel is supposed to throw it at me, I went to pull a petal off the flowers and the whole flower came off the stem.   Not too bad overall.  Something's bugging Joel and it's getting to him on stage, mostly in a good way, it's empowering his performance.  Today was the first day I didn't totally dislike the guy.  It's a weird thing to not like the person you're playing opposite of.  Especially, when the characters are supposed to be as in love as Zelda and Fitz were.  Maybe if we'd had a longer rehearsal process together things would be different.  Instead, we're just getting to know one another, and we lost time getting off to a rocky start.  Anyhow, if he doesn't go to the city for the day, we are going to try to get together for dinner.  Might be nice to spend some quality one-on-one time...  Speaking of which, Meagan and I  need  some alcoholically enhanced gossiping time sometime this weekend.  I wonder when/where the cast party will be...

      I should've known that nothing good could possibly come out of Washington DC. Duh.  So before this month I've never had a speeding ticket.  Now suddenly I have two, because of the stupid camera enforcement in Washington DC.  DAMN IT DAMN IT DAMN IT.  If I never go there again it will be to soon.  On that note...  maybe the subway is the best way to get around.... a good book, some tunes... sigh...  Oh yes, also in need of a new bank.  As mine is about an hour out of my way.

      In honor of Hillary Rea, my top five for the week (and the week ain't even over):  5. The production meeting from hell. 4. The three girls in my acting class who insist on jumping up and down with their arm in the air, while yelling the answers to my questions. 3. Speeding ticket (my very first in 10 years of driving). 2. Seth's girlfriend deciding that Seth and I aren't allowed to speak to each other anymore. 1. My sister deciding that she has an "inner gay man" named Bradley Aaron, who likes rainbows and musicals.

      Excellent rehearsal tonight!  Yay!    Hate my job.  Will look for something new for after Secret Garden.  Substituting perhaps???  I think I talked to Seth in the middle of the night last night, not sure.  Confirmation on that one please? (actually, I think we talked twice.  Not sure why he likes to call in the middle of the night though...)   Fool me once, fool me twice, let's fool around again Cause, baby,I'm in a Zelda mood tonight.  You won't find old romance anymore Candy hearts with silly poems, anymore Soda pop for a dime, well, now there's just no time for old romance.  Prohibition? Well, how long can it last? Prohibition, breaking rules is a gas... So tell us Mr. Wilson, what will you think of next? Well, just thank the dear lord that there's sex!  If we could stop the world and live the moment now We'd break the rules and make love, boy, and how!... I want to spend the night with you We could make whoopee!

      Crazy-ass dreams last night.  Won'e go into it, but really weird.  I don't remember dreaming so vividly in quite some time.    I discovered a new CD that I just adore.  Idina Menzel's  Here .  Its only a few songs,but damn is she great.  (And not in the same way that she's great in  Wicked .  Her song "You'd Be Surprised" really hit me the first time I heard it.  I'm going to start calling it my own personal anthem, or mantra:  "You'd Be Surprised"  You’d be surprised at all that I’ve become You’d be surprised, I changed while you’ve been gone And I’ve learned so much more from you then I could ever say If you were here, I think that you’d stay You’d be surprised how far these arms can reach You’d be surprised that there’s a promise I can keep Would you believe that I seldom fall to pieces anymore If you were here you’d like what you saw You’d be surprised  If you were here we’d make up time for all that’s disappeared And I’d hold you like I never could You’d be surprised my life is often sweet You’d be surprised, it’s you who brings me peace And for some unearthly reason it takes losing you to see  If you were here, I’d know just what you need You’d be surprised I loved you all along You’d be surprised and I’ll confess when I am wrong And I see the world around me in a slightly softer shade If you were here you wouldn’t walk away You’d be surprised If you were here we’d make up time for all that disappeared And I’d hold you like I never could You’d be surprised  If you were here we’d make it right  There’d be no tears and you’d confide in me And I’d be there, I’d be there

      Wow.    First off, I got a letter from Justin from Iraq.  I can't even describe how great that makes me feel.  We used to talk on the phone at least once a week and then crap happened and we didn't speak to each other for over a year.  Now it's a quick game of catch-up.  I miss him alot.  One of the few people that understood all about me.  it's funny that while I was in college, my close friends tried to discourage my friendship with him, just because...  and I didn't really stay in touch with any of them.  I'm glad I didn't listen to them, only to my heart.    Second, I have an interview for a driecting gig at one of the local high schools. yay!  Almost total artistic reign...    Third, I GOT A JOB AT THE FULTON!!!!!  A production of  The Secret Garden , making some good money and getting equity points! whoo hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Lastly,  Zelda  is going really really well.  I'm in a time crunch learning lyrics and lines but the choreography is done and now it's just a matter of memorization.  I also have a flapper dress to make!

      Man, these late nights are killing me.  I wish I didn't enjoy them so much...    I promised CJ that I would bitch about him in my weblog today.  He pulled an "Ernest" on me last night and I was just about ready to kick him.  But all is well now...  hehehe  Only a few more OG days.  I can make it,  I can make it... (my new mantra)  yawn... here I go, off to work...  P.S. Seth, I'm not avoiding you.  Timing has just sucked recently.  I keep missing your calls, and I know it's difficult to reach you.  Besides, you only ever call me when there's a drama.

      Went to see  De-Lovely  with Brian, Colette, Meg, Krissy, Erica, and Janna.  It was quite a lovely movie, my only complaint was the cheesiness of "Blow, Gabriel, Blow" near the end of the movie (I like the song, I just hated the way it was used.)  Kevin Kline was magnificent.  I'm very glad that Brian got to see this movie, having gotten to live with Cole Porter for some time.    Speaking of those characters, I've become obsessed.  Brian and I talked about it tonight.  I'm having a very difficult time letting this woman go.  We are so similar in many ways that I can't seperate the two.  I'll admit, part of me doesn't want to.  I'm looking forward to the NY version and because of that I can't just walk away.  I'm hoping that  The Secret Garden  will be something of a distraction for me...    Along similar (but not) lines, I'm real tired of people telling me that I'm a bitch.  I know I'm a bitch.  Let it go.  I'm ok with it, and if you're not then walk away.  I don't expect everyone to take to me.  I'm self-centered, controlling, bossy, and interminably focused.  And if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to do what I do.  There are very few people that I try to break down these walls for... (thank you, bri, for letting me be me)

      "You should be kissed and often and by someone who knows how."  -Rhett to Scarlett   "And, when love calls again, so foolishly they run. They run without a sound, the desperate ones..."   "They can keep us from kissing, but they can't keep us from singing!" - Hairspray   "...but it wouldn't be as awful as a summer in Ohio..."   "If I didn't believe in you, I couldn't have stood before all of our friends and said, 'this is the life I choose, this is the thing I can't bear to loose.  Trip us or trap us, but we refuse to fall.'  If I didn't believe in you, I wouldn't have loved you at all."   "Days of yore, kind and gentle... ask me if I'm sentimental?  Not for the life of me!"   "Poor?  Not me, honey, I don't want those money woes.  I'll marry Paul, or Dave, or Rob, or Peter so I can buy my clothes at Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman too... The Priviledged few, plus you-know-who!"  My new favorite: "Grab your dick and double clickl!"

      So, my sis and I are having a lovely ending to the day.  We got steamed crabs and for dessert, olives stuffed with garlic.  (Ok, we're a little weird sometimes.) We both fell asleep to  A Mighty Wind , and now wide awake, we are watching  The Princess Bride  which just happens to be on  tbs tonight. (I hope my  Zelda  friends are catching it too! As we initiaited some PB vigins this weekend.)   sigh... contentedness

      I am walking on clouds.     Zelda  is done now, but I have never become so attached to a character, to a cast, to a creative team...  If I were a writer I would better be able to put this all into words, however I'm not, so just try to catch a glimpse of my glow.   CJ wrote a song, somewhat about the 20's and this experience and when he sends me the lyrics I will post them.  As he sang it there were six of us standing together hanging on to each other "as if [we were] gold or something."  There was no better gift that was given during this experience then that song.    I'm sorry that I missed saying goodbye to everyone last night.  I'm especially sorry not to see Meghan, Adam, and CJ before they left (somehow I think Meghan will understand...) I was a little wrapped up in another goodbye...  (I'm in such a good mood, that even the OG didn't bother me today)
