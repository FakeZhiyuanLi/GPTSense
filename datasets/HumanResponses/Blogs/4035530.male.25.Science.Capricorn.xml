      Got a comment asking where "accidental academic" came from.&nbsp; To give a bit of background, I grew up in the SW of Western Australia, youngest son of&nbsp;wheat farmers.&nbsp; Now my parents are smart people but they aren't university educated.&nbsp; They are thinkers and taught us (two other brothers) how to think and make up our minds independently.&nbsp;  I decided to go to uni when I thought that I didn't want to be a farmer but I still wanted to be involved in the industry, plus uni was the done thing at the time.&nbsp; I just scraped in to a Ag science degree (quite a low entry requirement) and the long and the short of it is that I just scraped through that with honours (2nd class).  After looking around for a job for a while I heard rumours that a PhD in plant breeding was available, and because I needed something to do, I applied.&nbsp; Normally you need 1st class honours to be accepted - but again - I scraped through and was accepted.&nbsp; I have never been academically brilliant, but&nbsp;with 10 months to go until I finish, looking back I have nearly finished a path that I never intended on beginning.&nbsp; I'm not saying that I shouldn't be here, but I think it proves to me that God has had something bigger&nbsp;planned all along, and all the scraping by has been Gods way of reminding me that he is in control and that he is the one who gives and takes away.  The next step is where now?&nbsp; what has he got up his sleeve next?&nbsp; I don't fully know but I'm trying my best not to worry about it as, in the past, he has everything worked out!  "That in&nbsp;all things God works&nbsp;for the good for those that love him, who have been called according to his purpose" Romans 8:28

      How good are they!! I'm currently listening to the Live CD from 2003 and being reminded of why I like them.  Just simple powerful music, great stuff.

      I'm currently reading a book called rediscovering your spiritual passion.  So far its coming up with some good stuff.  I'm finding at the moment that thinking about what your passionate about and just getting back into it really helps - as dumb as it sounds you just have to do what you know you like and you end up liking it again.  Humans are so dumb sometimes.

      Its amazing how some people relate to music more than others, and it speaks to people differently. I lack the ability to just listen to music, I have to analyse it and think about the lyrics and what the songwriter was thinking about at the time. I therefore get a huge amount of of music and would say that it is the medium that makes me think and ponder life more than any other thing. Being a christian there are pressures that christian music is the only place to get this music inspired thinking but I disagree, in a big way. While a lot of contemporary christian music is good and thoughtful, a lot of the time it isn't honest. I appreciate honest songwritting, people struggling with life and how to get through it. I love hearing secular (I hate that word) music and hearing someone searching for something bigger.
