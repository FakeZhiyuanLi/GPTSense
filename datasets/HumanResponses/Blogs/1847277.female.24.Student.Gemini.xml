      Another day.  Grocery shopping.  Searching for pants online because Matt is a skinny dude.   Maybe going to a barbeque later tonight.  Fun times.

      Go Wolverines!  I have to admit that when I realized what a perfect football day it was today (70 degrees and sunny), I was bummed that I didn't get season tickets this year.  But, I watched the game on my fuzzy TV and was glad to see Michigan do some stompin'.  Hopefully the rest of the Big Ten can step up to the plate, too.  I was reading Matt's Northwestern magazine today (the alumni association hasn't figured out where I live yet), and I never cease to be amazed by how ridiculous some people are.  The last ten or so pages of the magazine are dedicated to alumni notes, which include weddings/births/deaths, but also random things sent in by alumni.  I mean, we have so-and-so from WCAS01 who sends in a note that they are now working for Kraft as a "cheese consumer data analyst."  Who the hell cares??  If it was a joke, it would be one thing, but it seemed totally serious (as it was paired with an announcement about what the person's fiancee was doing).  Matt joked that he should send in a note to say that he is now a cheese consumer and see if they'd publish it.  If you're actually doing something cool with your life, by all means tell the world.  But if your job sucks, why advertise it?   So while I can't say that I've completely gotten over my addiction to email (I checked yesterday and I've actually sent something like 150 emails in the month I've been home), I've gotten to the point where I'm less enthused, probably because no one is emailing me back.  But, once again, not everyone is as psycho as me.  And I suppose it's true that once classes start, I'm just as bad as everyone else.  Only three more days...

      I promised myself I would be productive today.  To that end, I did some laundry and washed the dishes.  And read something like 15 pages of an article on formation processes.  But after lunch I kind of gave up.  I took a nap and then wasted yet more time on Friendster.  I'm up to 14 friendsters.  Yay.  I even found some people from the fencing team at NU.  Ah, those were the days.  I attempted to Google myself yesterday (hard to do when you have a name like Jamie Clark, as there are millions of us), but I did find a link to the old fencing website that had my record from 1999.  1-6.  Yep, a grand .143.  Boy I sucked.  Someone this summer suggested that I start fencing again, and Michigan does have a club team, but I don't think it's worth my time.  I should find an extracurricular activity tho, outside of my Yoga and Butts/Guts classes at CCRB.  I'm thinking maybe Habitat for Humanity, although Matt made fun of me when I suggested it since I clearly don't know anything about carpentry.  We'll see how things go.    Today begins the new season of 007, the Friday night tradition where all the archaeologists start drinking at a bar around 5 and often keep going until the wee hours of the morning.  I think the latest I stayed at a 007 last year was probably 12, so my goal this year is to stick at least one out until the end.  It's kind of hard tho, because I'm allergic to cigarette smoke and Ann Arbor hasn't yet jumped onto the bandwagon of banning smoking in public places.  I didn't realize how good that was until I spent a weekend at bars/clubs in NYC and didn't have to worry about my eyes itching or coughing constantly.  And it's nice to get home and not reek of smoke.  Maybe I should send an email to my local city gov't person.  Whoever that may be...  Well, back to the formation processes.  Yippee.

      Wow.  Classes really need to start again.  I just don't know what to do with myself.  I've become the queen of wasting time.  Friendster.com will be the end of me.  But it is cool to see what people are up to, even if only in a marginal way.  I've spent the majority of my time trying to find a new laptop.  I think I'm going to end up coughing up way more money than I originally planned.  Dell now sucks, as they redesigned their laptops so that the hard drive is directly underneath the left palm rest.  So if you have anything over a 20 GB drive, the palm rest will always be uncomfortably hot to the touch.  Right now I'm thinking about getting an Alienware, which would certainly draw attention, but would set me back something like $2150.  Ouch.  That's about $500 more than I spent on the Dell that I ended up sending back.  But it would be wicked souped up, so I shouldn't be pining after a new machine for a long time.  And given how much time I spend on the computer each day, both for work and for play, I guess that isn't THAT much money.    So I met with Liz today to talk about her experiences in India.  Sounds like it's going to be a good time.  Of course, it also sounds like I'll probably spend at least a week or two being seriously ill.  Which also happened in Peru, so, whatever, I can deal.  I hope.  Although I do remember honestly wanting to die for a couple of those days in Moquegua.  One reason to work in a first world country, I suppose.  Less chances of death from weird things in the food/water.  But it just seems less exciting to be an archaeologists working in Germany than one who works in India or Peru or West Africa.  I'm determined to find a way to do some work in Africa in the next year.  Then I'll have fulfilled my goal of 5 digs on 5 continents.   Wazoo.    Okay, time to move from the computer to the TV for a half an hour of Yu-gi-oh fun.  Wheeeee.

      Okay, right.  Study.  Yeah, whatever.  It's the last week before classes start, and while I should have started studying for pre-lims already, I just can't make myself do it.  Of course, then I'm kind of left with nothing to do.  I don't even want to know how many hours I've wasted cruising around the Net and watching cartoons (yay, Pokemon and Yugioh).  There are always emails to catch up on, but eventually that gets old, too, and in the past month (well, since I've been back from Germany), I think I've sent something like 75 messages.  And not gotten anywhere near that many in response.  But so it goes.  The fact that Matt has moved to Ohio already doesn't really help the boredom factor.  At least I've made a couple of new friends around campus, and I just found out last week that an old friend from college will be starting a PhD program at UMich this fall.  So that's fun.  Given my metamorphosis over the summer, perhaps this fall will turn out to be a rockin' good time.  Screw worrying about prelims.  Well, Stephanie will be arriving momentarily so I should get ready to go out.  Yay for not having to cook for yet another night (Matt surprised me by coming home yesterday and took me out to dinner at Cafe Zola- it was an excellent meal, albeit a little expensive...).  Tsch√ºssle!

      When I was younger, I honestly believed that I could do anything I put my mind to.  Not that I'm any sort of super genius, but I am wicked determined, and with enough work/practice, anything is possible, right?  But whenever I would venture to say that to anyone, they would mock me and come up with something like "Well, if you wanted to be the kicker for the Packers, you couldn't do that,"  and I would argue that I could, but obviously that wouldn't have been true.    I don't feel the same way now.  I think that was a happier time...

      So I think I've been slacking again on the blogs.  But I'm not sure.  I haven't been on the computer much this weekend.  My cat is really sick, so much so that she had to be at the vet all day yesterday and I have to take her back tomorrow.  Poor kitty.  Her temperature is 104 degrees and she lost a pound since I took her to the vet on Monday.  That is no good.  Yesterday wasn't overly productive due to football and running back and forth to the vet (in football traffic).  I also had a wicked sinus headache and went to see Lost In Translation.  Good movie.  Bill Murray was totally perfect for the role he played- a rather sad, washed up film star.  It gets the Jamie seal of approval.  And was much less disturbing than Thirteen.  Today I'm reading about archaeological theory.  I spent three hours (or so) reading a 30 page article.  That doesn't bode well for the rest of my prelim studying for the week, which kind of sucks as I also have to start planning for a linguistic discussion at the end of the week.  Yay, hooray.  And, dude.  I can't believe that it's almost October.  Fall hit hard in Ann Arbor, with temps already in the 50s with chilly wind/rain.  Ah, gotta love the Midwest.  Also weird to think that NU just started school last week, and that Cambridge doesn't start for yet another week (although I guess they are on a totally different system).   right.  back to theory.

      So I saw Thirteen this evening.  Really depressing.  Was the world so different when I was 13 (which was a decade ago, I suppose)?  I don't remember girls doping up, shoplifting and having sex with high school guys (okay, perhaps one of the three, but not all in combination).  Maybe it's because I grew up in rural Kentucky.  But wow, it makes the thought of having kids really scary.  I mean, what's the world going to be like in 15-20 years when my kids are 13?  I shutter to imagine.    So I have become that which I hate.  An email slacker.  But when nothing is going on in your life, what can you do?  I mean, I get up, go to class/the museum, study for prelims all day, and then get on IM and/or talk to Matt on the phone at night.  No big news there.  I guess I should be less harsh with others who are slow with their replies.  Quote of the day: "Things have a life of their own.  It's simply a matter of waking up their souls..."  -Melaquides, from One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

      BTW, it's Wednesday night again.  Already.  And you know what?  I think your real friends are the ones who would come to your funeral if you died tomorrow.  Who would be there, and who wouldn't bother?  Think about it.

      So I just finished my practice prelim essays for the week but I have no one to give them to.  My advisors are both crazy crazy busy lately, which is bad for me, because both are normally so on top of things and all about near immediate email returns and the like.  That's right.  It's all about me.  I want their attention.  Screw their familes and commitments and publications.  Righto.    Ok, I know.  That's dumb.  But once you're used to getting attention it's hard to get used to being relegated to low priority status.    Now I have two hours to read stuff by Roman Jakobsen (one of the creative geniuses of our time, apparently), and then it's butts and guts time!  Wooo!

      Hmm.  It's one of those days when I wonder if I'm doing something worthwhile with my life.  I mean, there are probably six dozen other jobs (if not more) that I could do and make a much stronger/more important impact on the world.  I could be a doctor, a public interest lawyer, a secondary school teacher, a dentist, I could join the Peace Corps.  I could be a police or firewoman.  So why am I becoming an archaeologist?  Who am I really going to be able to help?  It makes me feel really selfish.

      Okay, I'm writing this so I should have an answer, but what sort of a purpose do blogs really serve for the people who write them?  I read blogs because I'm interested in what other people are doing and not always up for keeping in touch.  Thus, by reading the blog, I can have the benefits of being updated as to what is going on in their lives but don't have to deal with the hassle of maintaining contact.  Since when did I think maintaining contact was a hassle?  Well, okay, I don't really, but there are those people that you were friends (or close acquaintances) with at one point in your life but perhaps just don't have enough to say to to be in real contact anymore.  Ah well.    Anyway, I'm feeling crappy because I missed my butts and guts class AGAIN (the second time in only three weeks) because I had to take the cat to the vet.  She has an eye infection.  And, it's funny, because Matt and I always talk about how she's a little cat and it doesn't seem like she's grown much, but when we got her she was only 4.1 pounds and now she's 8.4.  So she's doubled in size.    Hmm.  I guess people are like that, too.  When you see someone constantly you don't realizing how much they're changing/growing (or how much you're changing yourself) because you're part of the process.  But, if you meet someone after not having been in contact for a long period of time, suddenly you realize that they (or you) have changed so much you don't even know them anymore (or vice versa).   Sadly, I feel that way when I go home, sometimes.  Of course, I never knew my sister or brother much to begin with, but it's happened with other people, like friends from high school.  I don't want it to happen with my friends from college, but change is one of those things that you can't, well, change.  It's a never ending process...

      So I've been a bit of a slacker with the blog.  And with email.  That just goes to show how busy I've been.  And of course I got the new FFT for the Game Boy Advance, so when I'm not working I tend to be playing that.  Or watching Alias.  What a useful existence.  It's another crazy busy weekend, what with having to write a prospectus for my Ancient India paper and working on two new prelim topics.    I'm experiencing some pain getting used to the Mac.  I fought with it for a couple of hours the other day trying to get my printer connected, and then yesterday I got a little fiesty when I was trying to save image files from Noah's CD to my hard drive.  Of course I never did figure it out, so I now have about 320 pictures of people I either don't know or met once (like his gf and his Mutti) saved to disk.  Ah well.    Right.  This entry is even crappier than normal.  Ah well...

      It's another Wednesday evening.  Senior year at Northwestern I always felt like I was in this weird time warp wherein it was always Thursday evening.  I'd be going about my business and before I knew it, it was Thursday again.  Wednesday is that day this year.  I can't believe another week is more than half over.  Time goes by so fast, and I feel like I never live life to the fullest, as it were.  There have been so few times in my life where I've just sat back, taken a deep breath, and let myself live for the moment, shoving aside all thoughts/worries about the future.  I was so proud of myself because I was able to do that in Germany.  The last week I was there was so amazing, partly because I finally just quit worrying about everything...    So my life is starting to come together.  Well, not my whole life, but the next year.  The pieces are all falling into place.  Which is good and bad.  Good because I like knowing what I'm going to be doing, bad because it's looking like I won't be able to make it to S. Africa this year.  The dig in India runs from Jan-Mar, and while I thought the project in Montenegro would be May-June, it's actually Apr-May, meaning that I'll only have a couple weeks in between.  But that leaves June open, now, and who knows where I'll end up. :)  It also looks like I will be heading to Israel, which will be an awesome experience even if I don't get to play the tourist.  Good times.

      My mom told me today that she was sending me a wedding announcement from their local paper because she thought I would be interested.  Who is getting married?  The boy I was in love with when I was in 4th grade.  Haha.  Not so much a boy anymore.  She's done this before, with a guy I was obsessed with in 9th grade.  We're getting old.  So many weddings.    I sometimes think that if my life wasn't crazy busy like it is now that I would just fall apart.  I wouldn't know how to deal.  But now I'm not sure I can deal with the crazy busy-ness, since I am also crazy confused about just about every aspect of my life.  I have to just hope/assume that it will all work out for the best, right?  At least the way it was meant to (of course, if I believe there is some certain way that things are "meant" to work out, does that mean I believe in predesination? I wonder about that sometimes)...  Is there really a reason for it all?  Sometimes I just don't know.

      Wow.  It's only 8 and I'm totally exhausted.  It's been a pretty productive day though- got lots of studying for prelims done and survived another Butts/Guts class.   Now I need to catch up with some email.  Noah has renewed his promise to send the photo CD, but Matt wants to make a bet about whether I'll get the CD or he'll get his mandolin (ordered 2 months ago) first.  It's possible that we'll never see either of them...  Speaking of that, while I understand that some people are just not good at email, it still bothers me.  When I invest a lot in a friendship I expect some decent communication.  Guess we can't always get what we want.  Righto.

      This is a love/hate post.  I like to bitch but I do it too much, so I'll start with a rant about things I hate and then attempt to balance it out with things I love.  I hate it when friends get demoted to acquaintances.  I hate having to make big decisions about my future that may involve pissing people off.  I hate conflict, really.  I hate Prarie Home Companion.  I hate it when people lie to me.  I hate broken promises.  I hate not understanding things.  I love Matt.  I love my friends.  I love sunny days.  I love chocolate ice cream.  I love knowing what is going on in my life.  I love being in control (but only to a certain extent).  I love opening my mailbox and finding real mail.  I love knowing secrets.  I love that I get to travel all over the world.

      The fog of the funk continues to thicken.  I wanted to have a good time at 007 tonight, but that was totally thwarted. I ended up coming home around 10 and after an hour of being angry and frustrated perhaps it is best if I just go to bed now.

      The cat is stalking me again.  She crouches behind my laptop screen and thinks that I can't see her back end sticking out.  She's so dumb, but I love her anyway.   I think I've fallen into a funk.  It happens occasionally.  Of course, I've been a moody bitch for the last several weeks, so perhaps tomorrow morning everything will be sunshine and roses again.  I somehow don't think so, though.  It's partially prelims, which are enough to drive even the most stalwart individual insane.  It's also my addiction to communication and resultant frustration at not having heard from people.  I am 100% a people person, and even though I spend a lot of time hating people (or did in the past), when I don't have close friends around, I go into crazy depressed mode.  It certainly made my first couple weeks in Germany suck a big one.  And this is why sitting in my lonely apartment studying all day every day is not good for me.  Ah well.  So it goes.

      Sometimes I wonder if I'm overly pessimistic.  Or, at least, if I appear that way in print/via email.  I consider myself generally a little cynical but not a crazy pessimist.  But I was looking over some old emails I sent to people and it seems like I'm always kind of a downer.  So I feel the need to start focusing on the happier things in life.  If only I can think of some happy things...    Well, I've studied for prelims today.  Not wicked happy.  I went to Zingerman's for brunch.  That made my tummy happy.  Got a frozen pizza on sale at Meijer.  Yeah, awesome!  Nothing like cheap food to make a girl's day.     Righto.  Definitely have to work on it.

      So.  Another late summer Saturday.  A trip to the Farmer's Market, a little bit of football, and a lot of studying.  Well, okay, not as much studying as there perhaps should have been.  But I was playing with my Powerbook.  And the iPod, too.  I think I finally have everything working.  Yay.  So, yet another day goes by with no mail.  Nichts.  Nada.  Nothing.  Boo on that.  But at this point I have at least realized that the photo CD I've been anxiously awaiting was probably never mailed, or at least was sent far later than originally planned.  I'm such a fiend for pictures.  Back when I was younger I used to always carry my camera with me, and as a result I have shoe boxes full of pictures.  However, and oddly enough, I have but one far away shot of me during my ho year.  I don't know why that is.  That always kind of disappointed me because they would have been good show and tell when I try to explain to people about the history of Jamie.  I certainly have plenty of pictures of poodle haired, dorky looking freshman year Jamie.  Ah well.  Hmm.  I've realized lately that I start far too many sentences with "So," and "And."  I should work on that.    Okay, off to check the football scores...

      I just got back from a concert in which all but one of the performers looked as though they just stepped out of a 1930s era Southern Baptist pulpit.  Picture starched suits and slicked back hair.  But it wasn't so bad.  I've learned to deal with bluegrass over the past four years.  And it makes Matt happy when I go with him to shows.     I got my new computer today, but by the time I got home, I had to start with dinner and then went to the show.  My enthusiasm has also waned a tiny bit as I realize that I really know nothing about how to use a Mac and thus there's definitely going to be a learning curve.  I just want to figure it out quickly so I can start playing with my new iPod!  Can anyone tell me why cats like to chill out in bags so much?  Or is this not normal kitten behavior?

      Yay!  My new DVD player and Matt's birthday present both arrived today.  And so did my new computer, although I can't pick it up until tomorrow since it looked like rain and I didn't want to carry it all the way back to my apt. from the Union.  I'm still debating whether or not I should buy the iPod.  I think I should.  It'd be a good thing to have in the field.  Of course, it's another expensive toy that could get stolen.  Ah, the pros and cons.    Ugh.  When you spend large chunks of your day reading it makes for a mighty boring blog.  So it goes, I guess.  I STILL didn't have any mail today.  That's like three days without even getting junk mail!  What's up with that?  Maybe the postal service has blacklisted me for dissing them in my blog.  Hmm.    I love you US Postal Service!! I love you!  I want to have your babies!  Just deliver my mail already!!  Maybe that will work :)  Well.  Time to try to throw together something yummy for dinner.  And then read about classical Indian civilization...

      Sometimes you see things that just make you want to do a happy dance.  Today I saw two of those things.  As I was walking towards campus, a guy came up behind me on a bike and alerted me to watch my left.  As the man passed, I was delighted to see a dignified 20-something year old guy in a business suit riding an El Chuck style bicycle with a huge seat and very widespaced handlebars.  He also had the seat set way too high so he was kind of balancing precariously.  Funny stuff.  Then, on the corner of Huron and Division, a corner I walk by nearly every day, I noticed renovations being done to a building that's been empty since I moved to Ann Arbor.  And what is moving into said building?  A Papa John's Pizza!!!! Yay!  I've been going through good pizza withdrawal for more than a year, and thus I am wicked excited.  I have actually spent a lot of time thinking about how much a PJ franchise could make in a huge college town such as this, and someone else obviously felt the same.  Yay once more!     Other than that my day has totally sucked.  Still no mail for Jamie, and I have SO much reading to do for my Ling class.  Many hundred pages by next Tuesday alone.  So I should probably work on that now.

      The first day of school.  How many people are lucky enough to know that they'll have a first day of school every year from kindergarten until when they die (or retire)?  I bet not that many.  This is the first year that I've broken a number of first day traditions, including buying/wearing a brand new pair of sneakers and/or new clothes.  Ah well.  My Tues/Thurs. class kind of sucked, and I think it's going to be a great deal of pain.  Not as bad as Traditions was last year, though.    Oh!  Exciting news.  I ordered a laptop today, although the model I wanted is on backorder.  So it may be Christmas before I actually see it.  It's a 1Ghz Powerbook G4.  It's sweet ass sweet.  And I got a great deal.  So I'm happy that's over with.  Of course, knowing my luck thus far, it probably will never come in and I'll be forced to start the search all over again.

      The only person who reads this blog felt the need to inform me that my entry for today sucked.  So here's attempt number two, which is bound to be no better than the first.  Being the last day before classes started, my goal was just to chill and ill, and I think I did pretty well at it.  Got up later than normal, talked on the phone for a couple of hours, read a book, went to the Chocolate Cafe with Matt, where I had some of the best hot chocolate ever made, made chili (by myself, which is a first... although Matt did provide nearly step by step instructions), and then ate and hung out with Allison and Margaret for a few hours.  Now I can spend a couple hours online and rock out to 99x.com.  Wahoo.  I'm guessing tomorrow is going to be wicked hectic and probably stressful, which is normally just the way I like it.  I function best under pressure.  I do hope, though, that I get the photo CD that Noah claimed he was going to mail last Monday, as that would at least be a nice end to the day.  And Matt might be coming home, which I suppose would be an even nicer end to the day. :)  So, yeah.  Nothing else to be said.

      It was a beautiful day.  I was angry at the beautiful day, because my Halloween costume requires me to wear snow pants.  But suddenly it's not so beautiful.  A cool wind blowing, a storm coming in.  Does that really make me happy?  No.  I can't focus today.  I fell asleep during Yoga.  I don't know if the instructor noticed or not.  You'd think that would be pretty hard, but we did "corpse pose" for 15 minutes, wherein you lie flat on your back and close your eyes and clear your mind.  That's just asking for sleep.    Sometimes I can't tell who my real friends are.  I mean, there are a select few who I know will always be there for me, and vice versa, but there are a lot of people out there who I have really depended upon at one time or another who I can tell couldn't give a shit about me.  And that's such a bad feeling.  Ah well.  I'm trying to be more independent- we'll see how it goes...

      So.    As I walk to campus in the morning, I find myself thinking of the most random things.  Sometimes deep, sometimes not.  Today, I found myself thinking about the way I've lived my life thus far...    Would you want to go back in time, say, be 15 again, and start all over?  Is there any particular moment that you would like to relive, doing things differently this time around?  Sometimes I do regret things done or not done, but I realized that I wouldn't want to do anything over again.  If I did, I wouldn't be the same person.  The things I've done, the choices I've made, they're what makes me, me.  And I'm happy with that.

      Coming to you live from the Shapiro Science Library...  I was going to go home to my sad and desolate little apartment, and then realized I just couldn't do it.  I was half-heartedly invited to go to a thrift store to look for something crazy to wear for Halloween, so I'm going to take up the offer, even though I may not really be welcome.    I got bitched at today for claiming I had nothing pressing to do.  Reminds me a bit of senior year of college.  I can't help it if I have my shit together and no one else does.  Ah well.  I just realized that the ol' blog is probably not going to make it through my 8-9 months away.  Guess it depends on what my internet access is like.  Hmmm...  Well, I should go track down the thrift store expedition....

      Jean Sibelius.  A master.  Listen to his symphonies if you ever get a chance.  Especially #2 and #5.    Happy day.  I finished my ling midterm, and I think it was decent.    Another happy story.  Two years ago, I copied some CDs on to my computer.  Last fall they wouldn't play anymore.  I figured it was some sort of copyright protection, since it was exactly a year since I had copied them.  So I deleted the files.  Or so I thought.  Today, they magically reappeared on my Windows Media Player.  Meaning happy fun music for Jamie.  Sweet.  Life should normalize a bit now.   Things are still so uncertain though, on so many levels.  And I really don't like not knowing what's going to happen (although, as was correctly pointed out to me, if I always knew what was going to happen, life certainly wouldn't be very exciting)...

      Crazy confusion still reigns supreme.  When I let it.  Right now, I don't want to let it.  I want to be happy and well adjusted.  I got my India paper done, but no prelim essays this week since I've had too much to do.  And we have two weeks for these topics, anyway.  After Monday when I turn in the midterm, I'll have plenty of time to write the essays.    It's another gray day in Ann Arbor.  Here's hoping the sun will come out and lift my spirits.

      It's a good day.  Busy but productive.  Much like my weekend in general.  Plowing through the prelim stuff.  Still more to go.  It'll probably take the rest of the afternoon, although I do need to get started on writing something for my India paper.   Oh, and there's always the joys of Butts and Guts.  At some point last month I talked about the fog of the funk.  Well, it has now lifted.  Finally.  So much happier.  Yay.  For once I actually feel normal and not all crazy and confused.  Sweet.    Next on Jamie's list of things to do: get over the addiction to email/IM.  I know I can do it.  Making more friends here will certainly help.

      Nothing much to blog about.  It's going to be a crazy week.  I have to write 3-5 pages of my India paper, deal with two huge prelim topics (chiefdoms and the origin and identification of states), and on Thursday I get my take-home midterm in Ling, which is most certainly going to kick my ass.  Boy oh boy.  I can hardly wait.  On a happy note, it's supposed to be 71 degrees and sunny tomorrow.  Yay.  I always wake up happier when the sun is shining in my window.

      Let's talk business.  I found out today that both of my advisors are going to be on sabbatical next year.  That is most certainly bad news for me.  First, I will need to be working on my prelim paper, which will certainly require help from Carla, and second, I will need to work out how to get to S. Africa (if I can't this year), and what to do about learning fauna, etc, and for that I need John.  Oh dear.  I suppose I'll have to have a long meeting with both of them before I leave for the semester.  Which, by the way, is two months from today.  Yay!

      So it's going to be a long evening.  I have realized that I am totally not a person who was meant to live alone.  I need human contact.  I mean, last year when I lived with Matt I was definitely not so attached to IM.  And since Dave's lady friend is visiting him and B-rat is in LA for a conference, I'm down to Calvin for the evening, and if he is even around, he will no doubt tire of my relentless babble.  I haven't ranted about not getting email lately, so: RANT RANT RANT.  I was admittedly slacking on my email there for awhile, but early last week I emailed everyone that I owed messages to and have only gotten one reply for ten emails sent out.  Boo on that.    Nowadays I do pretty well with the self-esteem, but when people don't email or poke fun in the wrong way, I start to revert to overly sensitive/self-conscious Jamie, and I feel like no one really likes me but just puts up with me because I won't go away.  I hate feeling that way, because I know it's dumb.  But you can't always control the way you feel.  I mean, when you deal with being made fun of throughout childhood/adolescence, it's not unusual to have definite self-esteem issues.  And I did, for a long time.  But during college I feel like I got over most of that, and sometimes I'm really good at not giving a shit what people think about me.  I wish now were one of those times.

      It's Wednesday again!   Again! Already!  I am going through the high that follows finishing prelim essays for the week.  And now I have to read Chomsky.  Or I should.  Soon.  I also have Butts and Guts.   Too much energy to sit at the computer!  Off to bounce off the walls.

      Perhaps this blog is going to become the documentation of my loss of sanity.  I honestly don't know what's wrong with me this semester- I have these crazy, inexplicable mood swings- I periodically get terribly depressed or really angry at the world, and then something will click and I'll go back to being happy Jamie.  Or at least normal Jamie, who is crazy but still generally content with life.    And what's with this use of the third person?  Blargh.  I really can't figure out which end is up anymore.

      Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  It's a beautiful, beautiful fall day.  The leaves have changed colors, it's sunny and warm, and it just smells like fall.  Too bad it's supposed to get cold again on Monday.    Matt and I went on a mini-date to the Arboretum and took a long, relaxing walk.  It was nice.  Now I have to work on prelim stuff, which is always a joy.  I think Matt is watching football and napping, which are perfect activities for a day like today.    Dave G. introduced me to the world of Skype yesterday.  It's a program on which you can actually talk over the net.  It seemed to work pretty well, although it's not Mac compatible so I can only use it when I'm at the office.  I don't know who I would talk to other than Dave, anyway.    While I don't have time to do things outside of school work, I think I do need to start finding things to do with myself at least a couple evenings a week.  Sitting alone in my apartment just waiting for people to get on IM seems a rather sorry existence.  And doesn't necessarily help my sanity.  But what else is there?  Going out to a bar by myself may end up being even less healthy...  Hmm....

      Blargh.  Spent the wee hours Wednesday night/Thursday morning vomiting.  And laying on the floor in the hallway outside the bathroom while the cat tried to eat my hair.  Great fun.  Given that I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I didn't make it to my ling. discussion.  I hate missing class, especially when it's a class that I'm fairly lost in.  Ah well.  This weekend promises to offer at least a little bit of a respite.  It's fall break, meaning there isn't class on Monday or Tuesday, although our prelim topics for the week do include the origins of agriculture, which means gobs and gobs of reading.  Of course, I took a whole class on that in undergrad, and did it again in two classes last year, so I should be okay.  I think.  I hope.    So, Columbus Day is Monday.  I don't really see why it's a national holiday.  I will instead jump on the Canadian bandwagon and celebrate Thanksgiving, instead.

      Tis a beautiful day.  75 degrees and sunny after nearly two weeks of weather cold enough that both a sweater and a coat were required (in fact, yesterday morning when I got up it was only 27 degrees!).      Why does being an adult have to be so hard?  Not that childhood is easy, I suppose.  Nothing is ever easy.  But if it was, I guess that I'd be less likely to appreciate life, right?  I miss Matt.  I think the cat senses my loneliness because she's started sleeping next to me again.  She hasn't done that since we first got her, when she used to try to sleep between me and Matt.

      I got shot up today.  Now I am polio proof (supposedly) and have also be inoculated against the flu.  I was told the primary reason for me to get the flu shot is basically so if I now come down with flu symptoms I have  incentive to get to a doctor because I may actually have SARS.  Great.  Just what I need.  More paranoia.   The possibility of more juggling around in my schedule has put me on edge yet again.  I think I need to work in a fairly stable country where this won't be quite so much of an issue.  I'm a psycho-freak about planning and always have been.    Damn.  I wish I had something clever and/or witty to say.  But I've got nothin.  Ah well.

      Another day.  I'm still lacking the motivation to study.  This is why I should just turn my computer off.  But of course I tried that once already, and twenty minutes later I just turned it back on.  Sigh.    I suppose if nothing else, I should be glad that even if things are crazy busy, they're still going pretty smoothly.  No major hurdles thus far.  Maybe I'm jinxing myself by saying anything.    I learned how to add a comment section to my blog, but then at the last minute I decided not to do it.  My guess is that no one would comment and then I would just be depressed.

      The wedding last night was a good time.  A very relaxed, open, comfortable atmosphere.  I didn't drink enough to get wasted but I did wake up this morning feeling all fuzzy and dehydrated.  Makes it harder to get up the motivation to study for prelims, but since I didn't do much yesterday, I suppose I should get crackin.    Matt and I have started talking wedding plans (okay, I'm doing the talking and Matt listens and tells me I'm silly most of the time).  We're debating about the wedding party. Matt originally argued we didn't even need one and it wasn't a crucial part of the wedding.  But of course it is!  And then there's the fact that I don't have any close friends who are girls, and it would be dumb to ask people I don't really like/know just to be conventional.  Better to have someone who I know and care about, and call them bridesmen or something else.  I can't find much etiquette advice online about what to do in this situation.  But I'm glad that I have friends who are open minded and willing to take part.  Yay.

      I am not a girl who often cries.  In fact, I would say that besides when I found out my grandmother died, the last time I really cried a lot was during my calculus class senior year of high school.  You see, I don't normally cry from anger, or from sadness, but from frustration (okay, I guess that's a type of anger).  And I didn't get calculus.  So I spent a lot of time crying over my homework until my sister would call and explain what I was actually supposed to be doing.  I want to cry now.  I hate linguistics.  I just don't get the problem set.  Makes no sense.  And thus I want to cry.  I've wasted so much time in the past two days trying to figure it out!! And my prof is not responding to my email.  Sigh.

      It's a rare morning blog.  My India class was cancelled today, but of course that doesn't mean I had time to sleep in.  I totally blew it last night and didn't get anything productive done.  So now I have to get my lazy ass out the door into the cold cold weather and get some quality work done at the office before my Yoga class.  I'm sad because even though Matt's coming home this weekend he's already said he's not going to have any time to spend with me.  We had been talking about going out to dinner, maybe to the new Zingerman's restaurant or maybe the Earle, and now he says he probably won't even have time for that.  That makes me sad and lonely.    This week we're entering the realm of prelim topics that I know very little about, which is a little scary (Note- for me, the week begins on Friday afternoon.  Screwed up, I know.  But true.  The weekend is totally meaningless for me).  It's going to mean more work, too.  Sigh.  I'm becoming less and less certain that I can do this without losing my mind.  For real.

      Hello everyone.  My name is Jamie Clark.  Not JAIME Clark.  I had a professor last year who would always spell it wrong, even after I pointed it out to her (I still fear she spelled it wrong on my letters of rec, which must have looked bad); I emailed her last weekend looking for a copy of a syllabus from a course I took with her, and of course she sent her reply to good old Jaime.  I mean, the From: section of the email clearly says "Jamie" and I sign my emails "--Jamie".  I just don't know.  Noah's done the same thing on a couple emails, even though I know he's aware of the correct spelling as it was right with the CD he sent.  Could that just be a really easy typo to make?  If so, why don't I make that mistake now and then?  Ha.  I know it's nothing to be upset about but it is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I also had to deal with another one of Jamie's top pet peeves today, someone assuming I'm around 16 years old.  It happens far more often than it should.  I was buying a new dress (which is totally hot, if I must say so myself) and related accessories for Meghan's wedding, and the cashier asked if I wanted a Marshall Field charge card, but quickly stated, "Oh, but you have to be 18.  You aren't old enough, are you."  Listen you old biddy, I'm 23.  I was eighteen FIVE years ago...  And of course, the typical response "Oh, you'll really appreciate it when you're older."  Yeah, right.  I'm not so sure I will.  I'm not the type that will think it's cute to still be getting carded when I'm 35.  But who knows, maybe I'll age poorly.  Always possible, considering I live the archaeology lifestyle of lots of hard labor and time in the sun.  I heard today that I'll be digging with a pick ax this winter.  Nothing like that to build up the old biceps.  Sweet.

      Just finished my prelim essays for the week.  I think I've gotten a pretty nice schedule together.  Work on prelim stuff Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday morning, read for Ling Tuesday night, write practice essays Wednesday morning/afternoon, finish Ling reading Wednesday night/Thursday morning, work on India stuff Friday and Saturday, and then start the whole cycle over again.  But it's really exhausting.  I already feel like I could sleep for days.  I've even noticed that by the end of the week I have the great black circles under my eyes.  Awesome.    In other news I woke up to cat vomit all over the floor downstairs.  Yep, think it's about time to get the carpet steam cleaned.  I hope she's okay and doesn't vomit again, because if she does, I'll definitely have to take her back to the vet.  Yay.

      So, the paper is done.  Wheee!  That means that although I have some ling reading to do, I have an otherwise free week!  Sweet!  No more papers, prelims are over, time for some maxin' and relaxin'.  And on Thursday me and Matt go to NYC!!! :)  It becomes time to catch up on the email I've been putting off due to prelims and papers and the like.  Of course, for me, putting off emails means it's only been two weeks since I emailed people, not like three months, but whatever.  In fact, I think I'll go and do that now!

      Woo.  Entering month 4 of the blog.  And some people thought I would lose interest.  Pshh.  It's amazing how much time I can spend procrastinating, and this is a perfect method.  So in Jamie's world, things are going fairly well.  The paper is chugging along- I've spent maybe four or five hours working today and have gotten nine solid pages written.  Tomorrow morning I have to get up early to try to add some more, but I'm thinking that maybe by mid-Saturday I can finish up.  That leaves Sunday to kind of relax and work on reading for my Linguistics discussion on Tuesday.  I found out on Monday that the money for the project in India was procured, but that doesn't solve the permit problem.  Apparently next week they are going to work on contacting the appropriate people in Delhi and see how that goes, although they are none too optimistic at this point.  As I've lamented before, it's looking more and more like it'll be another cold winter in Ann Arbor.  If I can't go I have to work out some sort of crafty scheme so that I can still travel with Dave.  As is, in order to participate in the Montenegrian project I will have to negotiate with the faculty to leave school two weeks prior to the end of classes (not including finals week).  I am wondering if I could pull off leaving three weeks early, spending the first week in southern Spain with Dave, convincing Bob not to say anything to the profs.  I think it will depend on the nature of the classes I end up taking, like whether they involve actual final exams or not.  If it's papers and projects I can just get my ass in gear and get stuff done early.   We shall see, we shall see....

      Prelims are over.  Yay! They were bad, tho.  The first half of the exam contained nothing that I was prepared to answer.  Meaning my three months of hard core studying were a bit of a waste.  This is what happens when a new person in the department makes the exam.  Sigh. Then we went out to a bar, where I discovered a department-wide conspiracy to get me wasted.  I was doing fine sticking with rum and cokes (it takes a LOT of rum to get me drunk), but was bullied into doing vodka shots.  However, general opinion states that it was not the vodka that did me in, but was in fact my last rum and coke, which was given to me in a large glass (like a tumbler that you would get water in at a normal restaurant), and was actually 85% rum.  But no one mentioned that to me, hence the conspiracy. So I puked.  A lot. Gross, really.  It would have been more fun if I could have just been tipsy or what not and not vomiting.  But now the archaeology peeps can leave me alone now that they finally succeeded in their two year quest to get me wasted.  I guess after I went home things got a little crazy and there was a four way kiss (two girls and two guys) among other things.  Would have been amusing. At least I was mostly spared the hangover.  I felt better after about 10 this morning.  And was mostly functional the rest of the day.  I was the only one in my cohort to make it to the ling lecture, tho.   Okay, have to get back to working on the history paper.  Wheee, fun.

      Yay for my sister.  She sent me Guster CDs.  My Guster CD was stolen en route to Blaubeuren (either at Heathrow or in the youth hostel), so it's been many months since I was able to listen to such smash hits as "Fa Fa" and "Rainy Day."  Speaking of smash hits, the real Strong Bad Sings CD came out today.  Not worth my $12, but interesting nonetheless.  I had another productive day today, which was nice.  I have more to do tonight, but I'm coming down with a chest cold so I probably won't get a lot done.  Sleep is probably the best option.    Woo!  Woo!!  In seven days I will be done with prelims!  They will be over and done with FOREVER.  Never again!  Yay!!!!!  Of course, as I've mentioned, that means I have to start working on my Ancient India paper, which is going to be a bit of a pain.    Still no word on India.  Which seems to be a really bad sign at this point.  Screw all.    More high school kids on field trips to the museum today.  I can't imagine how a high schooler would find it interesting in the least, but at least they don't squeal about the "boobies" in the Native American dioramas.  Of course, some of them come up with more lewd comments which shan't be shared here.  Ah, the joys of having an office in a Natural History museum.    Off to read about Mayan households...

      Spent a whole day working.  Yay for productivity.  I would really not mind at all if prelims were on Monday.  In fact, that might even make my life easier.  But you can't always get what you want...  Going out for Veronique's birthday tonight.  Should be fun.  Although I'm nearly broke so I won't be able to do much partying.  Plus, I have enough to do this weekend that I shouldn't be dealing with potential hangovers.  I hope Matt and I have time to go out tomorrow evening or at least have some quality alone time.  Okay, alone but together- you know what I mean.  It's that time again- waiting for email replies.  Of course, I'm familiar enough with people's communication skillz by now that I know who I will and won't hear from.  Meaning less frustration when certain individuals don't bother emailing me back...

      Okay, time to be pretend to be deep again- more things to think about- how many causes/people would you be willing to die for?  I get the feeling we're a selfish generation.  Or maybe I'm just selfish.  So life kinda sucks right now.  Prelims in less than 12 days.  Looking like India may not happen, but still won't know for sure until December.  Too late for South Africa. :( Jerrywill just suggested that perhaps I could still go to Burkina Faso, and I COULD ask Stephen and Daphne, although I'd probably have to pay for my own plane ticket.  Or I could ask Augustin if he'd take me to Senegal...  Hmm... Guess there are still some options.

      This blog entry is dedicated to B-rat, who provided the inspirational question/conversation.  He asked the following- "Do you ever really wonder if this IS as good as it gets?"  Good gracious, I hope not.  I mean, I suppose that was more meaning this phase in our lives, like, mid-20s, unmarried, relatively few responsibilities (i.e., no kids) etc.  But even then, I don't know.  I always thought that those people whose lives peaked in high school were lame.  But unless things start looking up, it appears that my life will have peaked in college, and is that any better?  Does life have to peak or can it plateau?  I dunno.  I think prelims are royally screwing with my perspective.  Perhaps in three weeks I will have a different view on things...

      Thoughts o' the Day:  AH!  T-minus 2 weeks until prelims.  Every now and then it hits me and I kinda freak out.  So, music.  I really like the iPod.  So much music.  Of course, I tend to be anti-music stealing, so thus far it just has various songs from all my CDs (mostly alternative type stuff from the mid-90s) and some of Matt's.  I am definitely one of those people who associates music with particular moments/times in my life, and the music I have constantly makes me think about sophomore-junior year of high school.  Not always a good thing.    Blagh.  Not in the mood to blog.

      Well, the stalking eventually proved successful, and the news was much as I expected.  It looks like South Africa won't pan out.  So I hope that India does, because I don't want to be in Ann Arbor this winter!  As everyone has pointed out, the semester post-prelims usually sucks because you're brain-fried and burned out.  So dealing with a full load of classes is not what I want to do, especially when there is only one class being offered that I would be really interested in taking, anyway.  Actually, I've pretty much had it with taking classes that aren't directly relevant to my life, but I know I have at least a couple more to look forward to.    Ack.  I don't want to go home, but I have to do laundry today, and I obviously need ot be at home to do that.  I have to do more reading for prelims tonight, yay.  I suppose that's pretty much all that's on my agenda between now and the 24th.  Hopefully I won't go totally stir crazy!!!

      The ever present struggle.  Do I stay at the office and listen to my Launch radio station (having SBC internet finally pays off!), or do I go home and keep the cat company?  I suppose I do have to stop by the store and get some dinner so I ought to leave before too long.  I still hate that empty apartment, though.  I'm starting to feel like a stalker.  One of these days, though, I will be successful in tracking Speth down...

      Wow.  Could be a new record for time between blogs.  The progressive party on Friday was a good time.  Matt came and wasn't even miserable until about three hours in, which was nice.  :)  The rest of the weekend was uneventful.  I freaked out a bit yesterday because I realized prelims are only three weeks away and I still have a lot of new reading and reviewing of old topics to do.  But I do think I'll be okay.    I emailed Speth in the hope that he has some new news for me.  As time keeps creeping by, I become less optimistic that I will be able to make something in South Africa work.  Which means I may have to start considering something related to Bob's project for my dissertation...  I feel a bit like I'm in some kind of weird time warp.  I mean, time is going by so fast, and yet things that happened only a short time ago feel like they happened years ago.  Like Meghan's wedding- that was only a month ago, but man.  Seems like ages.  What does that mean?  That a lot has been going on?  That I'm smoking crack?  I dunno....

      Wow.  Almost two weeks sans-blog.  That's what happens when you're traveling for the holidays, I suppose.  Matt's house was fun.  Good and relaxing, although I did do some work.  Big surprise.  I have to start teaching myself Serbian hard core.  Now we're at my parent's house and back to the land of high-speed internet!  Whee! Christmas was good.  I got home to find my brother and sister already gone, but that isn't a huge surprise.  My brother left a message with my mom to tell me that he didn't get me anything for Christmas so to just take back what I got him, but I didn't keep a receipt as I got him exactly what he asked for, so now he's stuck.  I told her to tell him (ah, passing messages through mom) to just get me an Amazon gift certificate.   I could buy any number of things with that.   Anyhoo, I asked my parents for a Canon S400 Digital Camera never expecting they would get it (as it was $400), but lo and behold, they did.  And so did Matt, because he knew I wanted it and didn't think they would get it for me.  So then I had two of them.  Heehee.  But Matt took his back.  And although I asked for 6 Game Boy games from any number of people, no one got me a single one.  Meaning if I  had been going to India and then off all sorts of other places, I would have been oh-so-bored.   Okay, spent 10 hours in the car today.  Need to zonk out.    Happy holidays to all!

      I'm thinking about the fierce thing again.  Maybe it's that I'm extremely vexatious.  I can imagine that some people feel that way about me every now and then.    I'm also feeling rather unsettled.  My advisor said that I'm on top of things, that I'm actually ahead of schedule, but man, I don't feel like it, especially now that I'm drifting in lack of prelim paper topic land.  I talked to both my advisors about possible topics today and neither had ideas that sounded particularly appealing to me.  Phooey.  I am remotely excited about maybe doing something with some skeletons, but I don't know that I'd be allowed to, and I don't have the required skills quite yet.  Worth sending out an email, though, I suppose.      Oh well.  I should probably study.  Fun.

      I can't recall if anyone has ever questioned my blog title.  I felt it was fitting to describe the aura of Jamie, and perhaps the reason people haven't commented is because they agree. But, I felt the need to look up all the definitions of fierce in the dictionary, and here's what we get:  1  a : violently hostile or aggressive in temperament     b : given to fighting or killing  2  a : marked by unrestrained zeal or vehemence      b : extremely vexatious, disappointing, or intense  3     : furiously active or determined  4     : wild or menacing in appearance  I suppose I was meaning the furiously active or determined thing.  But perhaps people think I'm wild in appearance?  Or given to killing? Hmm...

      At various times in my life I've had tendencies toward dwelling on the past.  I can be very good at dwelling.  I'm aware that I occasionally do this, and I don't particularly like it much.  I mean, I spent a good deal of time in my later years of high school dwelling on the events of my sophomore year.  Maybe this dwelling is somehow linked to old questions of regret, something I've mentioned in this blog before.  Anyway, I feel like my desire to keep a diary (well, in the past) or a blog, and to keep all old correspondences in part fuels this living in the past thing.  I was never more proud of myself than when I was finally able to throw away my old letters/pictures/etc from the Jason days.  And although less so, when I was able to let go and delete all those old high school emails.  Why do I want to be reminded of who I used to be?  Even in college, when I went home for breaks I would pull out the old diaries for a long evening's read, alternatively cringing and laughing at my silly little self.  I suppose do I like to remember certain moments in life, how I was feeling and what I was thinking.  Is there anything wrong with this?

      Life without drama is rather boring.  Not that I like drama.  It complicates things.  But a drama-less life means less to blog about, less to talk about, etc.  Right now all that is going on is finals.  Whee.    Well, 24 hours until I get the final word on India.  But she hadn't heard anything as of about 4:00 this afternoon, so that certainly seems a bad sign.    I'm meeting with various faculty members to talk about "life" on Monday morning.  Fun.  Time to come up with a prelim paper topic, break it to Carla that I'm going to do the Paleolithic for my dissertation, etc.    I've been suckered into taking a 4th class next semester.  I suppose that will help keep me busy, though, which is nice.  Of course, what with leaving early an all, I will be insane-o busy come late March.      I went to Vail today.  Not Colorado, but the co-op.  I was hanging out with Adam.  He tried to make me eat.  He claims I look like I'm from a third world country.  I'm not really that skinny, am I?  We watched some X-Files, and then I had to come home and work.  He invited me to come by and eat whenever I want.  I should take him up on that.   Well, maybe not the eating, but the visiting.  He's a lot like my little brother, but cooler.  I like my adopted brothers (okay, I only have two of them, Adam and Santiago, but they're both awesome). :)

      As I twiddled my thumbs in boredom today, I realized that there are less than two weeks until Christmas and I haven't done any shopping yet.  Oops.  And, with prelims and everything else that has been going on, I never did put up my Christmas tree!  Maybe that should be a project for tomorrow.  I bet Matt would be surprised (except now he can just read my blog and know that I'm thinking about it).  There's something warm and happy about a tree with pretty lights (okay, I really just like the pretty lights, I think).  Of course, tomorrow I get my linguistics final.  The reason I did fairly well on the midterm was because I spent the entirety of Thurs-Sun working on it.  Guess I should be prepared to do that again if I want to maintain my A- for the final grade.   Dave was harassing me today about harassing him.  He says I am on IM far too often and need to find some more friends.  I should have pointed out that the reason I bother him is because he's online just as much as I am.  Do I like sitting around on the computer all day/night?  Not particularly.  I still have issues with the living alone thing.  It's a different world when you have people around to go out with, watch TV with, just to hang out on the couch and talk to.  I miss that!  I could deal with roommates, for sure, as long as I had my own room/space.    Anywho.  That's more than enough from me for now.  I'm sure I'll have further ramblings tomorrow...

      Someone entertain me, please!  So bored.   Tired of studying about Ancient India.  In happy news, I did get my Alias Season 2 DVD set today, so I suppose I could start watching that.  I realized yesterday that I had only actually seen one of the Season 1 episodes, so they were all new to me, but I'm fairly sure I saw all the eps last season.  Ugh.  It's become my new obsession.  Since college football season is essentially over, I have no reason to check out ESPN.com in the morning, so instead I go to Alias message boards to look for spoilers.  So lame.    Hmm.

      I have a couple days respite before finals begin, which is nice.  I'm using the time to study for my Ancient India final, which isn't until next Wednesday, but I have my Ling take home final before that, which will no doubt eat up the entire weekend.  So I found out yesterday that you have to provide your own blue books for final exams here at Michigan.  How cheap can a University be?  Not to mention that the policy totally invites cheating, especially when the prof. provides study guides with possible essay questions.  Ah well.  Not my problem, I suppose, although I do have to get to one of the bookstores and buy some.    I passed prelims.  I realized I didn't post that yesterday.  And yes, I'm glad, but I'm not surprised.  After I saw the exam, I figured they had two options- fail us all or pass us all.  And obviously they weren't going to fail all of us.  But, as I have been lamenting to anyone who will listen, the fact that the faculty was just like 'Hey, you passed, no strings attached, good job,' with no other comments, well, that sucks.  Did I do particularly well?  Or poorly?  The way it stands now, I feel like most of the faculty probably didn't even really read them.  Maybe that's how it always is.  But if so, damn, we were less stressed than the previous cohorts, and we still put way too much effort into it.  Anyhow, I suppose I ought to get back to the studying.  Maybe I'll add more later.  Oh!  And last ling class today.  Yippee!!

      So New York was blizzard-y.  It meant a lot of time hanging out in Koo's apartment, but that was still good.  Brought back memories of 2209.    And we got to eat some awesome food at Gramercy Tavern.  Sweet.  And Matt even had a good time, I think.  Yay.

      I can't say I had an unproductive day, as I vaccuumed and did dishes and made cookies and straightened up the bedroom.  But it doesn't seem I did much.  That's okay, tho!  I must enjoy the free time while I still have it.  Two and a half weeks.  Then the great unknowns should be known; i.e., did I pass prelims?  will I be going to India?  what am I going to do with my cat?

      Thirty days has September, April, June and November... Which means today is December. Already! And I thought this semester was going to slog by. Of course, it's had more than it's share of shitty, shitty moments.    Feeling sick today.  After a long long meeting with advisor #2, I found myself with a terrific headache (and it was a good meeting), which did not go away and led to yucky nausea.  So I couldn't eat, and still can't, even though I have to eat as I need sustenance.  I wish Matt was here to take care of me.  I've pretty much been laying around for the past 5 hours.  And still don't feel much better.  Will be an early night, that's for sure...  But in happy news, Santiago called me tonight.  Yay!  And B-rat is back from vacation which means more people to talk to online. : )  I love my friends.

      Lots of pretty good news:  Bob does not yet have permit in hand but was told he was good to go, so he can buy the tickets.  Sweet.  Now I just need to find out from whence I will be flying.  I mean, I know I'll be flying from London, but I don't know which airport.  But it means I get to travel with Dave.  Wheee!  I met with Rachel, and it looks as though I will be able to work with the Philippine collection.  So now I have to get ready to spend many hours with deformed crania and old school ethnographies/travelers accounts.  It actually should be really interesting, though.  And, it seems like I have a lot of potential funding opportunities, which is sweet.  Of course, I cannot automatically assume that I will receive the funding.  If I do, though, I will be able to fund both the trip to Israel and the trip to South Africa next winter.  Meaning I can save more money for future expenses, like weddings and furniture and maybe even my dissertation field work if I get screwed funding-wise down the road.    So, things are looking up.  I am SO glad that this semester is happy.  Of course, as always there are down points, three of which come to mind:  1) Matt still lives in Ohio, 2) the cat vomited all over the downstairs when I was talking on the phone to Santiago (cutting off my phone call), and 3) my lower back has been hurting like a bitch.    Ah well.  It balances out, I suppose.  You can't have it all...

      Blah. Been another one of those days.  Sat at the museum ALL day and accomplished very little.  Partly due to lack of ability to stay focused.  I blame it on the fact that the lab alternated from stifling to freezing, which is just not good for the body.  The abdominator kinda kicked my ass today.  If I can actually make myself go to the two sessions a week I signed up for, I will certainly have wicked abs by the time it's all over.  Although I missed the first two weeks already.  Ah well.  We'll see how it goes.    I got home and felt yucky, which resulted in me laying down to take a nap at 8:15 and sleeping until 9:45.  Then I woke back up and after some inital grogginess (in which I made a sort of incoherent phone call to Matt), I ate some food and then was able to actually finish one of my article summaries for my presentation in geoarch on Friday.    If I can actually do my Creative Explosion presentation next week, I will be all set, having lots of time to focus on my prelim paper stuff.  And applying for funding, yippee.  I'm meeting with John on Thursday to try to get his opinion on what funding I should apply for and for which projects.  I also need to talk to him about what I should do this summer- ie, should I really try to go on a project in France or stick with Germany?  I mean, if the Montenegro and Israel things work out, I should be good in terms of real work for the summer, and it would be really nice to actually go back to a place for once, where I know the people and am semi comfortable with the place/language.  Although I already fear that the Serbian I am learning is pushing the German out of my head...  And have I mentioned in my blog that my cat will now actually play fetch?  For real.  What other cats play fetch?

Boo on human osteology, which is a good class but a bitch load of work. Boo on not knowing if we're going to get our permit for Montenegro. Boo on Calvin having to work a bazillion hours and never being online. Boo on being busy busy busy and falling behind on email. Boo on people who don't email me back as much as I want them to. Boo on working all the time yet never seeming to accomplish anything. And boo on phone calls not being free.

      So I suppose I am slacking a wee bit with the blog.  And while that means my adoring public (as if I have one of those) knows less about what is going on in my life, it's mostly because there isn't much going on.  Busy with the four classes and the prelim paper, but it makes time go by quickly, if nothing else.   And, on that note, I need to get back to work.  I have to try to finish up what needs to get done today and then bake a cake.  Or should I work more tonight and bake the cake in the morning?  Hmm.  I dunno...

      So it's going to be a weekend o' fun.  Need to clean the apartment a bit, have to read some things about the creative explosion in the Upper Paleolithic, have to do a lot of looking at crania pictures to try to learn the important features on the temporals, occipital, and parietals.  And figure out how to tell them apart when you only have tiny little fragments.  Wheee.  Stupid Latin names.  It means that there's just lots of memorization involved.  I guess I also need to know about measurement points on the skull, so I have to draw a complete skull (I think I'm just going to focus on the front) and add the points in my notebook.  This class is a LOT of work.  Sigh.  No class on Monday, though, so that gives me a bit more time.  Anyhoo, I need to go.  Should get dressed and ready to go.  Stupid cold weather.

      Okay, let's stop with the laziness.  I mean, in real life I've been far from lazy.  It's my internet life that's been hurting.  Less time on IM, I'm actually behind on email, I haven't been blogging as much as usual.  Some might say that this is a good thing.  But I especially miss my evening IM convos with Calvin, as our schedules just don't seem to be matching up.  :(  But, real life is good.  I'm busy, as always,  but good busy.  Busy by choice.  Not busy by demand.  I mean, I wasn't looking forward to prelims and I didn't like studying for them, and that took up all my time/energy.  I was told that I'd go into brainfreeze the semester after prelims,  but I've kicked it up a notch.  I'm taking four classes, three of which are great, two of which will require tons of work, and I'm getting my prelim paper research off the ground.  And of course I'm taking aerobics classes, and trying to be more social, too.  So that leaves little time for play.  But, that's okay.  I'm happy.  I did have a really good break with Matt, I'm doing things I like, in a few months I'll be in the field, yay!  Anyway, I need to print some articles and start on the prelim paper stuff, so off I go.   :)

      Okay, so I didn't update on first day of school happenings as I had planned.  That's mostly because I felt terrible after class, so I came home and slept on and off, never getting out of bed until yesterday AM.  And last night I went out to dinner and then to a bar since some friends are leaving for the field today and won't be back until April, at which time I'll be gone.     Anyhoo, it's been a rather crazy past couple of days.  I'm trying to get my scheduling worked out so that I can leave early to vacation with Dave, and I have a lot of other errands/things that I'm trying to take care of.  Actually, I should get to work.  I'll try to post something more interesting later. : )

      The first day of classes.  Wheee. The wind chill is -7.  The air temperature is 7.   I can barely contain my excitement.  At least I only have one 9 am class this semester, and it only meets once a week.  Although I have grand plans of getting up and being at the museum by 9 every morning, anyway.  We'll see if it actually happens.  I know it won't this week, as Matt is home and I'd like to spend as much time with him as I can.  I'm actually looking forward to the majority of my classes this term, which is always a nice feeling.  But ugh, I am going to be oh-so-busy.  And it's already started, what with the fellowship application, and trying to work out scheduling with my profs (since I'm leaving early and all).    We'll see how it goes.   I'll probably post a post-first day wrap up this evening.

      So now I'm back in Ann Arbor which means I can really go back to the world of blog.  And what an exciting world it is...  Yeah, right.   So I have two days before classes start, and need to spend them getting ready for the new semester and writing a grant proposal.  Wheee, fun.  And it's weird, because it's for a $500 grant, which isn't much,  but they allow you to write up to 5 pages for your proposal.  Which seems a LOT to require for what is kind of a puny amount of money.  But, I'll just have mine be shorter and hope it's okay.    It was soooo nice to have a break... and I didn't even pine after the internet/IM.  Sweet.  Of course, I suppose it helped that the couple times I did log on, there wasn't generally anyone else online, anyway.    Supposed to snow 12 inches today.  Yay.  And I need to grocery shop, too, so I hope it doesn't start until later.

      Wow. I've been really slacking on the blog this month.  Eeek.   I just realized that my watch does not understand Leap Years and thus thought today was March 1.  So I had to set it back to Feb 28.  Anyway, it's March already?  Geez.  I leave in just over a month, and I have so much to do.  Kinda depressing, really. So, if I just finished Spring Break, why in the world didn't I blog?  Good question.  First, I kind of forgot I had a blog.  Silly but true.  Second, I spent a lot of frustrating time on the net trying to plan vacations, and I would generally be so annoyed by the time I was done that I just wanted to get offline.  The trip with Mr. Guarrera fell through, which sucks, as I was really looking forward to hitting southern Spain.  Sunny skies, warm temps- it would have been the life. Instead, I'm hitting Budapest, Eger, and Vienna with Calvin and El Chuck.  Should be a good time, and the planning was much easier.  A couple hours on the phone, a few hours searching for hostels/hotels, and we were set.  All that is left to plan is two train trips and a reservation for one night in Eger.  I'm a bit concerned about how I'm going to deal with all my plane transfers, as I bought tickets at all sorts of different times, and on different airlines.  I'm not sure where I'll be able to check bags through and where I'll have to be running around the airport (Heathrow, most likely) like a chicken with my head cut off, trying to figure out what to do next. Anyway, I'm off to do some reading and maybe take a walk, since it's actually kinda nice outside.  Well, it was nice, and it's still warmish, but no longer sunny.  I'll take what I can get, tho.

      So I'm feeling rather unsettled.  Not sure why.  This happens every now and then.  Ugh.  Hope I can shake it off with a good night's sleep.  Midterm tomorrow.  And back to Augustin's pot.  Not sure what I'm doing tomorrow evening.  There's 007, of course, but I was also invited to a potluck at a prof's house.  I actually was just planning on coming home pretty early since I'm not feeling so hot.    Hmmmmm.  Sometimes I think I need to start writing again.  I used to write a lot, not that I ever wrote anything good, and it's been a long time since I've done so.  But I need a creative outlet.    Hmm.

      Sigh.  I'm in a rather introspective mood today.  It's more irritating than anything else.  Bob wasn't around, so I couldn't actually get the Montenegro tickets yet, but I did get my tickets for Detroit-London, bracketing the beginning and the end of my massive trip.  Wheee, fun.  I'm flying into Heathrow because that seemed to be easiest.  We'll see how that works out.    Anyhoo, off to read more about the Philippines at Spanish Contact.

      So, another weekend is almost over.  I pretty much got done what I wanted to get done, so that's something.  I think tomorrow I'll finally get my tickets for Montenegro worked out, which then gives a baseline for dates for the Spain trip, at least for the date on which whoever I'm traveling with will have to compromise and make sure we are in a city with an airport so that I can get to London.   Ah shoot.  Stuff to do.

      Geez.  It's been a week since I updated my blog?  This week has just flown by, much like every other week this semester.  My body is still working really hard to defend against the nasty cold/flu thing that everyone else in the department is succumbing to, but I think it's starting take over.  The past couple days I've had sore throats and I've also been really exhausted come evening.  Ah well.  So I found out today that I won the fellowship that I applied for in January.  It's only $500, which isn't much, but hey, it's better than nothing.  And I'm proud that I won it, even though I'm guessing not more than half a dozen people applied.  Yay for funding to help me pay for my summer voyage.  Now, the poo story:  I don't know if I've posted about this, but for a few weeks we had this problem wherein the cat would poo on the floor nearly every night.  Only at night, and always in the same general spot near the front door.  This was, of course, very annoying, so we tried changing her food, cleaning the closet with the litter box, getting a new box and new litter, and nothing at all worked.  Finally, we thought that maybe something in the closet scared her at some point (although she's used that closet for the past year without trouble), so we got a new, smaller box in addition to the old one and put it in the bathroom.  Problem solved.  Although she uses the downstairs box occasionally, she would only poo upstairs.  And over the past week, I've noticed she has a habit of pooing whenever I am in the tub/shower, no matter what time of night that is.  This is unpleasant, especially when you're enjoying a relaxing bath, because who wants to smell cat poo while bathing?  So today I thought, I'm tired, I don't feel well, I want to enjoy my bath pillow and read in the bath.  So I shut the door.  And what does she do?  Poos on the floor in the same old spot downstairs while I'm in the tub.  F(@Q#&$%@!((~!!!  Stupid cat!!  She is the most spiteful creature I have ever seen.

      One self-named "JJDoggywill" has the following to say about my earlier post..  "Hey Clark,  ... This does not prevent me from reading your blog, and due to your unfortunate lack of comment space none of your close friends can make witty comments about you "sexing" crania to the amusement of your devoted readers all around the world.  Not sure how you, as a girl, go about that, and I don't wanna know!  Ha ha.  I'm so mature.  Well, we all have our lapses every now and then... "  Let's all applaud his maturity ;).  And for those of you who may be unclear, when I say I need to age and sex the crania I mean determine the age and sex, ie, juvenile female or whatnot, as I'm looking at the distribution of cranial deformation along both geographic and demographic lines.

      So hmm. I spent way too many hours today relabelling the Philippine crania, but at least they're in order by site now, which is quite nice.  As long as they stay in that order, I'll be good to go come August when I actually have to try to age and sex them and examine pathology and whatnot by region.  Wheee. I think I'm mostly taking the evening off.  By Wednesday I need a break.  It's midweek, and Tuesdays and Thursdays blow.  In happy fun news, it looks like I'll be spending July in Kenya!  Sweet!

      Damn. An annoying day already and it's only 10am.  I got up to an email from Nick saying he's not sure that there will be room for me on the crew in Germany this year.... what?? When I talked to both him and Kurt in the fall they implied it would be all good.  So what is this shit?  And I got up early to be at the osteo lab at 9- we're supposed to have lab at 9, but when I went last week the TA wasn't there so the door was locked.  I asked her about it last week, and she said she would be there from 9-9:30 today so I could get in.  I sat there for 15 minutes, and she didn't show.  So much for that.  Shit.  Now I may have to miss abdominator to go in tonight.

      Woo.  I have survived the year of hell mostly unscathed.  I finished my last paper last week, so now all I have to do is normal weekly things, and then give a presentation on Friday.  And then I'm done and will be off to the field. I'm psyched, but I'll miss Matt.  :/  I really can't believe I survived this year.  Nor can I believe that I actually kept this blog the whole year.  I was reading some of my old entries, and damn, I'm a whiny bitch sometimes. ;)  So my schedule appears to be as follows (for those of you who are stalking me- I know you're out there!)  April 3-April 11- Hungary and Austria with Calvin and the Chuck (yay for vacation!) April 11-May 12- Montenegro, trying to avoid being the one stuck in the bottom of the 75 foot deep trench May 12-May 13- (is this even worth putting on here?)- visiting Dave (and Noah?) at Cambridge May 13-May 21- Ann Arbor, visiting Matt (and making wedding plans!) May 22- Spending 14+ hours in Heathrow (good lord, let me find an alternate plan!) May 23-July 1- Israel, working in the faunal lab on the Givat Ram campus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem July 1-August 1- Southwest Kenya, digging and walking in straight lines looking for archaeological sites  For those who are counting, that's three continents (four if you include N. America) in four months, with lots of digging and research and a bit of fun here and there.  Here's hoping it'll be a good time!

      I talked to Bob today... not about the violence, which appears to have been contained, but about field things in general.  It sounds like it will be a good time.  And I'm excited because the top scholar for Middle Paleolithic lithic analysis will be there.  So I can finally learn lithics, well, on a basic level, at least, since he and I will only overlap for a couple weeks.  Which means I can prepare to be lonely/isolated the first couple weeks, as usual. It'll give me time to work on my Serbian, at least.

      My career is turning into a study of disappoinment.  Let's recap: my field school was cancelled last minute, leaving me to scramble to find something else and resulting in me having to pay thousands of dollars.  Last summer I was supposed to go to southern Turkey to find a prelim project and to work with my friend Andy.  Then the war in Iraq started and the field season got cancelled.  This fall, I invested a lot of time doing research on the South Indian Neolithic in preparation for a field season with Carla, at which I would analyze the Neolithic materials for my prelim paper.  The field season got cancelled at the last minute due to issues with the permit.  I am supposed to start a project in Montenegro in three weeks- the permit was obtained, the funding is at hand, and we've bought the plane tickets.  Two days ago serious ethnic conflict erupted in Kosovo for the first time in 5 years.  Kosovo borders Montenegro.  The conflict involves Serbians.  This does NOT bode well, especially since the violence does not appear to be abating.   Why?  What is this?  Is someone trying to tell me something?  Maybe I shouldn't be an archaeologist?  Maybe I just choose shitty places to dig?  I guess in a way I set myself up for this.  I mean, I'm scheduled to be in Jerusalem in May and June.  Yeah, that's a stable place.  Sigh.    But, to note- I'm not sure yet that my trip will get cancelled, and I haven't even talked to Bob about it.  But I can't imagine that widespread looting/burning/killing/rioting can go on for long without the Serbs getting involved (the last time this happened WE ended up bombing the crap out of the Serbs to make them stop the war), and at that point, I can't see how we could go.  Sniff, sniff, sniff.  And here I thought I'd actually get to have a good, normal field season.

      Clavicle, Scapula, Humerus, Radius, Ulna.  Those are the bones I need to be able to identify by tomorrow at 1pm.  Total I could ID now: 0.  I mean, sure, if you have a whole bone, but even when there's a whole bone, I need to be able to side it, which I can't do as of yet, and, the quiz will pretty much just be fragments, and for each, you must identify the bone, which side, and which element of that particular bone is pointed to.  Suckity suck suck.  This is why I should have gone into the lab today to study.  I guess what I may need to do is go in tomorrow morning at 8.  But ugh, that's so damn early.  Maybe I'll just head over at 11 after my seminar gets out.

      So, as to the random post from yesterday, which was described as  "crypic and sad," those lines form the chorus of a song that I had stuck in my head all day.  They struck me as particularly poignant, but that rest of the song kinda sucks.   I suppose I was in a kind of dreary mood yesterday, mostly because Matt is out of town and I basically worked the entire day.  Not so much fun.   I'm in one of those stages where I'd just like to rip out my hair, as too much is going on that I can't control, and I just want a little more order in my life.  I have too much to do in too little time, I don't have plans for July worked out quite yet, and I'm going to be having serious financial difficulties if I don't get the funding that I applied for.  But I won't know if I have the money until after I've left for Montenegro.  Sigh.  I'm going to email the places I applied to and find out if there's any way that I can hear back before Apr 3 (as both said they'd let you know by Apr 15).   One of my neighbors (there are 8 apartments in my building) stopped by this morning because he had locked himself out of his apartment in his slippers and jammies (he was taking laundry down), and it was barely above freezing outside.  He was not so happy.  And since he had people's phone numbers in his cell phone, which was in his apartment, he wasn't entirely sure what to do.  But after about 15 tries, he finally got ahold of his advisor, who was nice enough to stop by the office and pick up the guy's spare set of keys.  I don't know if my profs would have been nice enough to do that early on a Sunday morning.

      I leave in a month! This is both happy and sad.  Happy because I really enjoy my work and like being in the field, even if I bitch about it during the fact.  Sad because it means I have to leave Matt and the cat and people here.  So according to Adam I'm an "alcohologist."  Well, not me, in particular, but archaeologists in general.  Interesting to see how we're viewed by the other subdisciplines.  Ah well.  That really doesn't characterize me, given my general lack of drinking, but I suppose I know a lot of people to whom such a label would apply.    I'm working on a paper on volcanic eruptions and human evolution.  I have realized that one of the generally accepted viewpoints is totally wrong.  But that's okay.  Gives me something to write about, I suppose.  Too bad I'm not the only one to notice that or I could try to get something published.  I want publications!!!!!  Okay, no more procrastinating.  Back to the volcano articles...

      I'm depressed about my generally uninteresting life, which is no doubt well-reflected in my equally uninteresting blog.  I mean, I travel a lot, shouldn't that mean I have an interesting life?  Apparently not.  I spent the day reworking the budget for my funding proposals (AGAIN!), but I think I'm finally done.  Now I just have to bump up the proposals themselves, and then I'll be good to go.  Okay, this is random and perhaps uninteresting, but, I'll include a brief story from my trip to Germany last summer...  I have yet to really experience culture shock-- I didn't even have a problem in Peru-- but I definitely noticed some things about Germany that are definitely unique.  Or, at least, different than the way things are here.  Like the fact that women in their mid-to-late 40s have no qualms about wearing clothes you wouldn't see on anyone over the age of 19 here in the States.  And the fact that kids run wild with seemingly little supervision.  The site that I worked at last year was a cave near a small city in southern Germany, along some of the fabulous bike trails that cross the Schwabian Alb.  The cave was next to a small river and  an open field with a grill pit and some picnic tables for those visiting the site or just wanting to stop while on a biking trip.  Every now and then we'd get field trips stopping by, some of whom had signed up for a tour and demonstrations of Paleolithic technology with the leader of the dig.  When these kids would arrive, they generally ran amuk, frolicking in the stream (after stripping to their underwear), trying to climb up the steep embankment outside the cave, etc.  One of the activities was making their own spears, which they would then throw at a target.  To do this, each of these kids (who were never more than 8-10 years old) had their own (usually very sharp) pocket knife, and they'd just run around blade first.  Then they made pointy sticks, which they also ran around with.  How eyes did not end up getting poked out is beyond me.  On one particular trip, after making the aforementioned pointy sticks, they decided use the sticks to grill sausages over the fire.  Meaning the kids were essentially playing in/around an open fire, with no adults in sight.  I can't picture any of this ever happening on a field trip in the States.  Anyhoo, in the midst of this chaos, one particular hot dog went on quite the voyage.  A boy tried to put it on his stick but ended up breaking it in half.  He carried it around for awhile, but it eventually ended up getting dropped on the ground.  Not just on the ground, but on top of a wool stocking cap (I'll note that it was mid-June and near 80 degrees).  We found this particuarly funny and I have a great digital picture of said sausage, but unfortunately I have no website on which to post photos, so you'll just have to trust me.  I thought this would be the end of the story, but no... about fifteen minutes later, a girl walks by, notices the hotdog on the hat on the gravel, looks at it for a minute, then proceeds to pick it up, put it on her pointy stick, grill it, and eat it.  Ah, the amusement.    And there's a lame story for you. :)

      Woah.  I was in for a shock when I went to homestarrunner.com and got a "this domain is under construction" message.  But lo and behold, it was actually just a new cartoon featuring anime style Strong Bad.  Funny stuff.    I can't believe I leave in two days.  I am in a general state of disbelief lately.  And I've also become crazy scatter- brained.  Don't know why/how this happened, but it's annoying, yo.  I keep losing things and forgetting stuff.  Sigh.  This bodes poorly for my trip, as I'm bound to forget some critical item.  Although I've already packed clothes, so at least I won't go naked. :)  I still have some emails to catch up with, some things to pack, some things to buy, and hmm, some other things I'm not remembering.    I think Matt and Diana are coming over tonight!  Yay!  That is happy.  I probably won't see Diana again until, well, gee.  I dunno.  I assume she'll visit Ann Arbor some point during the fall.    Hmm.  So despite all that's going on, I still don't have much to blog about.

      Um, yeah. Alone in the lab with my aurochs bone.  Nice.  Israelis listen to an odd assortment of American music- one station plays everything from Usher's Yeah, Yeah to various Elvis hits to Travis' cover of Hit Me Baby One More Time.  And for some odd reason, Israeli music sounds a lot like Serbian music.    I slept a crazy amount yesterday.  From like 6:45-10, and then from 2:45am-11.  Ah well.  Guess I'm still catching up.  I only have a few more Bos from the UP layers to code, then I'm going to print some articles and go outside and read.  But I forgot my sunscreen.... hmm.  Guess I'll be freckly.  I was thinking about going downtown with Herve (the French version of Harvey), but I either missed him or he didn't bother coming in before he went out.  Okay, need to focus- just a few more bones to go!

      so i have another minute, and wanted to provide an update:  my luggage was found! dave has it. yay!   so a couple notes about israel:  it's so quiet on campus it's eerie.  shabat doesn't officially start until sundown (i thought), but they don't have class on fridays here, and no one comes to campus.  you'd think since it's a science campus all the science dorks would be here.  but no.  guess they want a two day weekend, as sunday is a regular class day.  i was sick of hiking boots so i bought some flip flops at akademon, the discount store on campus (which, alas, does not sell hebrew u. gear).  if i have ever in my life had flip flops, it's been more than a decade.  i've always been very anti-flip flop, and now i learn why.  they flip and flop (as the name implies) and just never stay on your feet.  and they aren't so comfortable!  ah well.  so i hear there might be a shopping center around here somewhere.  and that said shopping center has an h&m.  so i can really be stylin in my cheap clothing.  heehee.

      So after a crazy, crazy week, my luggage is still missing.  They finally figured out that you just can't get unaccompanied baggage into Israel- big surprise.  But, supposedly they did finally find it yesterday and were going to deliver it to Dave at Cambridge.  Now, the website says that it was already delivered, but Dave has not confirmed that he has it- he had an exam yesterday and maybe didn't make it to the mail room or wherever they would have delivered the stuff to.  I hope he will actually email me to let me know- because if it didn't get there and they claim that it did, the problem becomes intensified because then I don't know how I would get any money for it.  Phooey. Phooey.

      Can I geta J-E-T and an L-A-G!  What's that spell? "Jetlag"  I can't hear you "JETlag"  A little bit louder now "JETLAG!!"  Ah, the crazy stages of jetlag.  I'm not sure if anyone is out there reading this, especially given my month hiatus while I was in Montenegro, but I suppose I do it more for myself than anything else, so I'll keep posting.  I am in Israel.  It's really nice here.  Sunny, beautiful weather, green everywhere, lots of flowers and cats, a lab full of stuff to do.  There's just one thing missing.  No, not my sanity.  My luggage.  Which is hopefully either already in London or on its way there.  It got left behind in Newark, which stinks.  But I barely made my trans-Atlantic flight myself.  The luggage counter girl in Heathrow said I should be glad I at least made it, but if I had missed the flight, I would not have been separated from my luggage and they would have had to put me and it together on a later flight.   Ah well.  I know I am overly attached to my stuff sometimes, but I don't have that much, and my bags had all my new, fancy camping gear in them, and also had my favorite summer clothes/shoes.    Anyhoo, hours 1-5 of Israel are shaping up to be WAY better than all of Montenegro.  I got food, new very unstyling clothing (1 set and PJs), a tour of the lab, and given the seat of honor at the computer.  Sweet.  What more could a girl ask for?  Well, besides a great big hug and kiss from Matt.  :(((((  OK, maybe time to nap?

      Okay, when I was being confused about my last post before departing, apparently I was forgetting that I actually left on like Apr. 3.  So my Apr. 1 post was my good bye message.  Ah well.  It seems that I've lost a lot of brain cells over the course of my trip.  I wonder how many more I can lose over the next two months or so.    So I went to the museum today, where I chatted up Karen, Hemanth, and Donna.  Everyone seemed to be doing alright, and it doesn't seem that I missed much while I was gone.  There are 4 new students starting in the fall, which was just enough to result in me being booted over to the Treehouse.  That's really kind of sad.  I wish I was staying in the museum.  Maybe I can find a way to get an RA position for my 4th year so that I can move back.  I was going to move all my stuff this week while I had some free time, but I guess the people who are currently in my office haven't moved out yet, and don't have to until August 1, so my desk can remain a mess until I get back.    Matt and I are working on wedding plans.  Ooh, fun.  Actually, it's both fun and intensely stressful all at the same time.  We've decided to go for something kind of informal.  This is not suprising given that it's me and Matt.  And because we don't have much money.  Speaking of money, I got all the funding that I requested for the summer, which means I'm set for all my trips and for South Africa in the winter.  Yay!  That's very happy.  Now, if only I can find a dissertation project...  Yumm... Matt is making pizza and it smells good.  He claims that it's going to be bad cause the crust didn't rise, but it does smell tasty.  Anyhoo, I am pissed off at travelocity.com, as I ordered tickets from them on Friday with Priority Overnight delivery by Fed Ex, but they didn't come today.  They screwed up and sent my order to travelocity.co.uk, who it seems mailed them via regular post, which means I won't get the tickets before I leave the country.  This is a big problem.  I'm going to call them again tomorrow and bitch a lot.  We'll see how that goes.

      Wow.  A new look for blogger.com.  Or maybe just a new look for the Mac version of Blogger.   Anyhoo, have I not posted since 1 Apr?  That's weird.  I figured I would have posted a so long and thanks for all the fish type email before leaving for the field.   So, I survived field season #1 mostly unscathed, and now I'm in Ann Arbor for a week before heading off for trips #2 and #3.  Montenegro is a beautiful country, and while there are certainly some nice things about it, as a whole it certainly wasn't somewhere that I could fit in.  I don't drink or smoke enough for that.  And, while I'm not one of those crazy women's lib people, I certainly couldn't deal with their machismo crap, either.  But I did meet some very nice people, which allowed me to make it through without going insane.  I must say, though, that it was honestly the longest month of my life.  It was so nice to get home to Matt.  Now we're working on wedding planning, which may be equally able to drive me insane, but will no doubt have a happy ending.  Okay, I'll post again before I head off to Israel, but that's it for now!

      Oh!  And this is probably my last post before August, since I won't have email access in Kenya.  So, unless I'm feeling super motivated and manuever some time on Dave's computer, adios to all and I hope everyone has a happy summer.

      It's DOOMSDAY...  No, actually, it's Monday, but it's the last full day in Israel.  Which is kind of the opposite of doomsday, I suppose.  A day from now, I'll be on a plane, on my way to jolly old England, and two days from now, I'll be chillin and illin with Dave.  And three days from now... Yes, okay, this could get ridiculous.  But, humor me one last time... one week from now, I'll be in Nairobi! I'm kind of hoping that fate will smile on me and that Stan will either know someone or will himself have great materials for me to work with for my dissertation.  Although it is true that I'd really like to work in South Africa.  So, what to do?  I mean, if Stan offered me something, would I then not go to South Africa in the winter?  Or would I still go just to make contacts and maybe to start learning the fauna, even if I wouldn't be doing my dissertation there?  I guess this is kind of a counting my chickens before they hatch scenario.   Hmm.  As I type this it isn't word wrapping, but going in a really really long line.  I hope it doesn't try to post that way, because that clearly wouldn't work. Anyway, the moral of the story is that I'm very excited to be done here, because it means that I'm closer to going home, and that in two days I'll be with friends.  Yay.

      Okay, I somehow came across some blogs of people who had only created them in order to get a beta gmail account.  Are these people insane?  First, come on.  It's an email account.  Big deal.  Second, yahoo clearly beat google to the punch.  They have 2GB storage for subscribers to SBC internet or those who shell out the bucks, and 100MB (which is still a lot- it's more than my university provides!) for free.  Ah well. People are silly sometimes.  Matt and I have decided to go to Colorado in August, to attend a wedding we weren't directly invited to and to have a mini-vacation.  For some reason, I have always had this romantic, idealized vision of Colorado as a land of wonder.  Maybe that means I'll just be disappointed.

      Ha.  I was looking at my previous posts, and how many posts can I begin with the word "so"?  Apparently quite a lot.  Yesterday Ed showed up in my lab.  Who is Ed, you might ask?  Well, Ed was my partner for the final project in my Zooarch class with Gil, wherein we did some work on carnivore damage on the Hellenistic assemblage from his site in Turkey.  Anyhoo, a girl who graduated from NU with me (one of the few archaeologists, although she was actually a major and I wasn't) just sent mea message last week and mentioned that Ed was in the city, although I really didn't expect to actually run into him.  Once again, I am reminded of what a small world I am a part of.   I may have mentioned this before, but there are loads and loads (gobs, even) of feral cats that hang around the campus.  In the past two weeks or so, the kittens have started wandering around.  Now, they aren't tiny and are certainly at least a couple months old, but I didn't actually start seeing them until recently.  And there are also cat fights everywhere.  I haven't actually seen one yet, but we hear them in the lab all the time.  Some of the cats are actually cute, and I really want to play with them, but given that they have claws and teeth and could be disease-ridden, I guess that would be a poor idea.  Ah well.

      So, it starts to be crunch time here at the lab.  T-minus 9 days and counting...  I haven't started freaking out about all the shit I need to do before going to Africa, which is good.  The only thing I really need to remember to do is fill out my Visa form, and I guess even if I forgot, I could actually do it in the airport in Nairobi.  And I suppose I ought to email the director so he remembers to have someone pick me up.  I am quite psyched about going to the UK.  I'll see Dave for the first time in over 2 years, I'll hopefully hang out with Noah for a bit, and I'm going to dinner with Caleb and his fiancee, and, actually, it's probably been over 2 years since I've seen Caleb, too.  And I get to be reunited with my luggage.  I swear I'll kiss it when I see it.  I don't care how filth-encrusted it is (cause it was pretty nasty after Montenegro)..

      So.   Been a few days. Not much new to post about. Life on the Givat Ram campus of Hebrew University is pretty much the same as always.  I guess tonight I'm going out to dinner with Natalie (the friendly Canadian) and John.  I'm really tired tho, so I'd almost prefer just to stay in and have a cup o' noodles.  Plus, I have to do laundry.  So if I go out, I either have to stay up late doing laundry, or come in later tomorrow morning in order to do it then.  But John won't approve of that since I came in late yesterday and we're going to someone's house for lunch tomorrow.  Phooey.  So I guess it's a late night to me. Hmm.  What's up with Madonna changing her name to Esther?  Or did she just take an additional name?  I guess that's probably what it was.  But Esther?  Geez. Ah, okay.  I'm going to go back to work.  I hope I have some emails tomorrow.  Today I didn't have any.  Well, one that Matt sent last night.  But nothing new popped up during the day, which is always sad and depressing.

      So I seem to have come down with a cold.  This is absurd because the weather is beautiful and none of the 5 people I am around on a daily basis have a cold.  Ah well.    The bones continue to be bones.  I've coded over 1200 now, which is making pretty good progress.  I have two more weeks before I leave for London, and then a few days after that it's off to Kenya.  It's a little scary but will hopefully be good.    Given my easy access to the internet here, it's going to be quite a shock to dive back into lack of communication land.  I hope I can deal without too much trouble (like the withdrawal I went through last year!).  I was actually okay in Montenegro, although it is so nice to actually be able to be in touch with people on a regular basis.  Yes, I know I'm a communication freak, but what can I say, I like people.  (Okay, I don't like the general public most of the time, but I love my friends.)  Time to end this lame-o post and get to work...

      Here I am, on the road again...  Okay, so I'm not on the road again yet, but I'm dreaming of the day... The past few days have seemed very long.  And very monotonous.  And now Matt is at the cottage so I can't talk to him (sniff, sniff!), and I won't have any emails from him, either.  Phooey!  Herve leaves on Wednesday night, which is sad because he livens up the lab.  I'll have no one to sign along to bad Israeli radio with anymore.  Oh well.  Okay, ought to get back to work...

      It's In Your Head...  Ugh.  It's gotten to the point that I'm dreaming about bones.  I had this dream where I couldn't figure out what a bone was and was terrified that I would misidentify it, but, really, if I misidentified a bone or two it certainly wouldn't be the end of the world.  I mean, gobs of the stuff I'm working with no was supposedly identified to species by someone, but it's wrong a great percentage of the time, and it's not the end of the world- just a little bit more work for me.  Matt told me this terrible story about my cat, in that it fell out of a third story window onto a wooden deck.  But I guess she's okay.  Or she seems to be okay.  I hope she is.  Ahh.  I'm sleepy.  And this chair reclines rather nicely, so maybe I'll just close my eyes.....  ZzZZZZzzzZZZZZZZZzzz

      The Wave of the Future?  Just after I read about (and get excited about) photo blogging, now they introduce free audio blogging?  Granted, I can't really afford to be calling a number in the US just to leave audio blogs, but maybe at some point I'd find it useful for something?  Okay, maybe it's just silly.  But where is blogger getting the money to host these potentially huge blogs (media files are always big)?  I guess it's the Google connection and those silly ads at the top of the screen.  Of course, it is no doubt possible that they will start charging for blogspace soon.  I guess we'll see. So, nothing new to report.  It's slightly amusing because this week I have gotten three emails from people wishing me a happy birthday.  One didn't have access on my birthday, the other two thought my birthday was on the 5th and 6th, respectively.  That's okay, tho- I often remember only vaguely when someone's birthday is- like I knew Dave's was around mine, but I was sure it was the 4th and it was actually the 3rd.  And I have three more birthdays coming up that I need to be sure to remember.   Wow.  What a boring post.  Reflection of my life, I guess.

      The land of dreams...  Israel truly is the land of dreams.  I've dreamt every single night I've been here.  Which is unusual, and always vaguely interesting since my dreams are usually so whack.  I'd like to know what they mean about my psyche (maybe I really am a crazy person).  Ah well.  So begins another week in the lab.  I have some tedious work to do today, like going through boxes in search of Bos and washing other stuff, but that means that I'll be back to coding for the next few days, at least.

      I emailed Matt about this, but it's still making me sad so I'm going to repeat the story here:  There's an old man who works in the zooarch lab a few mornings a week, sorting tiny little snail shells.  This morning he asked if I would mind reading a letter he had written in English, since English is his third language and he is not very comfortable writing it.  As I read the letter, he explained that it was to an anthropologist in Germany that is doing a study on German culture before and after the Second World War.  She was collecting pictures of school children with their zuckertute, which are these bags of goodies that kids get on their first day of school.  He had one of these pictures of his sister, and he was mailing it to the woman with the letter.  He closed the letter by stating that both his parents and his 3 sisters (all pictured) were killed in the Holocaust not long after the picture was taken.  That is incredibly sad and depressing.  Why were the Nazis such terrible people?  I mean, sure, I can understand the existence of one crazy evil man like Hitler, but why did so many people so willingly (granted, they weren't all willing) go along with the madness?  Sometimes I just don't understand the world, and I hate the way people can be so destructive.   And then I think, a lot of people in Israel no doubt have similar stories.  And of course it wasn't just the Holocaust, the Jews have been persecuted time and time again throughout history.  And that must do something to the collective psyche.  No wonder some of them are so crazy about Israeli nationalism- they built this country, and it's the only place a lot of them can call home.   Sigh.  It's such a big, confusing, complicated mess.

      Acheiving Zen...  So, today is a Zen day.  I had the luxury of sleeping in, and there's nothing like waking up and knowing you don't have to get up, so you can snooze away.  I have also acheived Zen in that I can now walk properly in flip flops, and I can actually look into the microscope without getting a headache.  You must allow your eyes to unfocus before they can refocus with the scope.  Right.  Anyway.  I told Joe that I learn something about myself, and learn something in general, every time I go to the field.  This year, I said, my goal was to learn patience.  Not something I generally have a lot of.  And I definitely needed it in order to maintain my sanity.  I'm not sure what I'm going to come away with from this project.  Other than lots of knowledge about how to identify bone, which is of course most useful for the future.  But in terms of personal growth, not sure I'll score.  Ah well.

      So, another day, another, um, bone?  It's only 5 o'clock, but I think that's about time to call it quits for the day.  It is officially the weekend here, and I deserve a bit of time to myself.  Although it's not like I have anything to do at Beit Belgia, my home away from home.   I checked my blog today to see if there were any comments, and was quite dismayed to see that the keys words that were used to pull advertising for today were flip flops!  I don't want an ad for flip flop distributors on my blog! I hate the darned things (although I must admit that I'm growing more used to them). So I found out that there was a press release put out about the Neanderthal tooth we found at Crvena Stijena.  This is kind of silly, because it was completely out of context and not very meaningful.  I mean, if Neanderthals lived there long enough to build up 11+ meters of deposits, there ought to be at least a tooth or two laying around.  Anyway, the press release claimed that the tooth dates between 40-150,000.  This is a total farce, as we have no idea at all what the MP layers date to.  None at all.  Could be 35-350,000 for all we know.  Anyway, I just find it kind of annoying. Since I've been here nearly 2 weeks now, my lack of a washing machine is going to start to become a problem.  I have been washing socks/underwear/tank tops in the bathtub, but the pants are more difficult, because they're all long pants and they're cotton and thus will take FOREVER to dry.  But I remember how damn stinky my pants got after a few weeks of wear in Montenegro... so I guess I'll have to do something about it before too long.  Of course, I can wash myself here, and my work isn't dirty, so that probably helps.   Actually, come to think of it, I can't believe it's been two weeks since I left home already.  Time has gone by super fast.  Way faster than that time in Montenegro.  I find this a good sign, as it seems to mean that I can focus attention on bone for many hours a day and not want to kill myself. Okay, hmm.  Off to catch up with email...

      Gee, I'm giddy today. Don't know why. But it's nice to be happy about the world-- even if my birthday was forgotten by the general population (okay, that's it- I'm done being bitter about it now).   And I have this strange fluttery feeling in my stomach, as if something exciting is going to happen. I've gotten lots of emails in the last three days.  But I've sent loads and loads, so I guess that is to be expected.  But me + emails = happiness.    To the bones!

      Sorry about my morning post.  I was just grumpy.  I don't mean to yell at my loyal (or not so loyal readers), especially since I wasn't able to provide a birthday shout out to one of them because I was stuck in Montenegro (happy late bday Jerrywill- see, I'm only a month and a couple weeks late), and I guess I owe Mike a much less late but still belated happy birthday, too! Let's just celebrate everyone's birthdays on one day.  Like a second Christmas, but preferably during the summer.

      Happy frickin' birthday to me.  That's right.  Feel lousy if you forgot, cause here I am in Israel all alone with my bones, and I only got birthday wishes from one person in the whole world.   (okay, I'm bitter cause I'm a huge birthday person and spending bdays alone in various countries away from family/friends stinks, and I know that there's an 8 hour time difference and maybe tomorrow when I check my email I'll have birthday wishes in my inbox, but still...)

      The new blog template: good or bad?  A little more flashy.  And no more links.  I found out that now you can post pictures to your blog if you download a specific program, and I'll be all about that once I get home.  Yay for making the blog more exciting.  And, if you didn't notice, now you can also add comments.  Not that anyone has comments, but, well, if you do, feel free.  But if they're nasty I'll delete them. :)  So, I haven't tried to be deep or meaningful on my blog in a long, long time.  That needs to be remedied.  Today I was actually reflecting on the past year (I had to fill out a yearly progress report for my NSF fellowship), and I realized how much I've grown up since last year at this time.  I know I've commented before that whoever says you're grown up at 18 is full of crap, but it's worth revisiting.  I mean, last June, I never would have imagined that I'd be where I am right now.  In terms of academics, personal life, everything.  I finally am starting to figure out what I want to do with myself academically, I passed prelims, I have new friends (including girls!), I've done lots and lots of traveling, etc.  And of course there was the drinking until I puked thing.  Lots and lots of lessons learned. So, at the end of the day, do I feel like I'm a better person?  Well, maybe not, but I think I now have the potential to be a better person.   And you can take that as you will.  :)

      I'm back and badder than ever.  Righto.  So, after a month in Africa and a 36 hour voyage home, I've actually already left Ann Arbor again.  Now I'm embarking upon a 2.5 week journey in which Matt and I will be driving something like 4000 miles.  Okay, maybe not quite that many, but close.  But I'll see my family, my friends, and my cat, and I'll be with Matt, so it should be worth it.    Anyhoo, Kenya was really good.  I got along with Stan, I have lots of ideas about dissertation projects, etc.     And I don't feel like typing in my blog.
