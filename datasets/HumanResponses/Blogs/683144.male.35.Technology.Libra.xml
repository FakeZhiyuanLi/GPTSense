						   Thanks to a friendly listener of the radio show I host, I received a GMail invite literally within hours of the broadcast of today's show. Check it out:     I'll have a ton more screenshots here when I get a chance to look around and play with the features.

						   Google is pretty slick with how they are making their invites to the beta like Orkut invites. However, they are limiting the invites which will drive up the demand even more.  urlLink Jeremy Zawodny's blog :  "You'd think I was giving out free money or something. They're not pre-IPO shares, just gmail invites." I put in my request to get an invite if Jeremy has any left. My guess is I'm too late. If anybody reading this has invites, then send one over. My contact info is listed  urlLink here

						   One of the more thorough reviews I've come across. I'm going to make a column along the left and start adding the better reviews of GMail to this list. Good job, Adam!  urlLink BLADAM - Entry: "Google's Gmail - An in-depth look" : "Gmail is generally a delight to use. While it is not yet fit to be a substitute for client-based e-mail systems (Eudora, Outlook, etc.), nor does it yet have all the features of competing Webmail services, Gmail is blindingly fast, its ads are unobtrusive (often even informative and useful), and its label paradigm is promising. And of course, as one would expect, the search features are unparalled"

						   Detroit Free Press -  urlLink Google's new Gmail has a few quirks, but it works   - "I've been e-mailing like a spammer the past few days, testing out the new, soon-to-be-public e-mail service from Google called Gmail. ..."  I like this article because Mike gives specific real world examples of how the controversial targeted advertising works. It sounds to me like it isn't all that controversial at all. He also lists the cool features:  Gmail's most outstanding feature is the cogent and convenient way it organizes mail by collapsible threads, displaying the messages in context and sequence, just like conversations. All the e-mail is searchable.  Other nice touches include a spam filter, a spell checker and keyboard shortcuts you can program.

						   This is one of the best articles I've read to date on the GMail privacy situation. It is well-reasoned and thorough. Kudos to Mr. Templeton:  The GMail Saga: "I come to this problem from two sides. One, I'm a fan of Google, and have been friends with Google's management since they started the company. I've also consulted for Google on other matters and make surprising revenue from their Adsense program on my web site.  I'm also a privacy advocate and Chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, well regarded as one of the top civil rights advocates in cyberspace. The EFF has issued some statements of privacy concern over GMail, though we declined joining the coalition against it."

						    urlLink Slashdot  is having a discussion about GMail being available to some active Blogger subscribers.

Misery loves company! I'm going to try and write something to this blog every day until I get a GMail invitation. I'm also going to be citing what other proponents and opponents are saying about GMail.

						    urlLink    I've noticed from the Google alerts I receive for the keyword Gmail have slowed down. In fact, no new articles have come in since May 25, which is almost a week. Could this be the first sign of the fever-pitched interest of Gmail slowing down? Of course all Gmail has to do is issue some more invitations and the fever will start anew.

						   I'm wondering how long it will be before someone writes a book about Gmail. It would be odd for this to happen while it is still in beta, because so much could change, but I wouldn't be surprised if at least one book is written and published before the end of the year.  Perhaps Gmail for Dummies ???

						   Ok, well, 4% as of the screenshot below ... but I'm guessing later today it will be 5%.   urlLink    So here is where I'm at on Gmail space, just 4 hours shy of one week. I'm sure when the 4 hours is up, I'll be at 40MB which will be 5% of my Gmail allotment. Remember, this is my normal email inflow from a couple domains, this isn't me encouraging spam or signing up for special accounts. Here's my  urlLink original blog entry last week  when I turned on the switch.  At this rate, basic math tells me I'll have roughly 20 weeks or 4 months before I burn up the 1 gig allotment and need to start deleting. I'll continue to monitor this and update this until the space is gone.

						   I did something I don't remember ever doing before a couple days ago: I actually responded to spam received to my Gmail account  asking   for more information. I was showing a spammer interest! This is virtual sacrilege.  The result? No response yet!  I thought the whole point with spam was to get people that were interested. So, here I respond to some spam with interest and I get ignored? What's up with that? No, I'm not going to run down the spammer and send a follow-up email. I do wonder, though ... here I'm getting 1000+ spams a day on average and the one time, the one time I respond, I get no response.  Amazing.  BTW, I just noticed when I went to post, this blog was listed first so I didn't have to choose from the dropdown menu. Very cool, thanks Google!

						   I have been using GMail and Gmail interchangeably when writing in this blog. Think I probably should be using the lowercase Gmail as that seems to be the most popular, although if you look at the Gmail logo, the M in mail is capitalized. This is a stupid little detail, or is it ... I like to be consistent. In the title of this blog I didn't use the capital M, but pretty much since that time I've used it.  So it will be Gmail from now on unless somebody comes along in the comments section and convinces me that it should indeed be as the "GMail" logo suggests.

						   Yesterday I started diverting an email address since 1998 to GMail and also several of our domains through GMail. It's not all of my email but it's a good chunk of what I receive daily. This is sort of my own internal test like  urlLink prattboy is running .  Spam received for first day, Saturday 5/14/04: 1446 GMail informs me:  You are currently using 5 MB (1%) of your 1000 MB.   Guess this means at this rate I'll have about 100 days before I'm out of space, doesn't it? I'm not going to track it every day or spend much time analyzing the spam (Prattboy is already doing that), but I'll come back from time to time and give you an update with where I'm at with my own email.  It should be noted that he artificially requested an increase in spam delivery to his GMail box and I am just using the normal email that I receive every day, with one of those email addresses being active for over 6 years (1998-2004). I haven't published my GMail address anywhere, including here.  I'll have more to say about the spam and how to deal with it in GMail in future entries.

						   During the  urlLink Script School radio show  today the discussion amon listeners came up in the chat about how several webmasters are blocking link submissions from free email using webmasters because of deceptive business practices. Things like once they get their site listed they take down the reciprocal link, redirecting the submitted URL, changing the site, etc. I suggested to the listeners that at least at this moment when GMail is not available to the masses it would be a good idea  not  to block  submissions from GMail users.  This also got me wondering about the validity of these claims. It is true that if someone wants a free email address they are available easily. When I signed up for Yahoo I opted not to receive the email address. We also do not use our cable email address at this time. We never used the DSL one either for our office or home.  I do use GMail though. At least now I'm using it as a way to better manage some of my email. Will I go away from it once it becomes available to the masses? Perhaps for regular usage, but I still like the search aspect of it and I think it is easily better than Yahoo or Hotmail. I'm still getting used to it though and I still have a bunch of screenshots to share when I get to it.  Now if only I can figure out how to change the default dropdown option in Blogger so that it goes to this blog and not my other one whenever I make a post. Guess I need to search the knowledge base ...

						   With all due respect to Yahoo, it is somewhat disingenuous to suggest that this move to increase their free email storage to 100 MB doesn't have anything to do with GMail offering users in beta 1GB of storage.  urlLink Things that ... make you go hmm Yahoo free email storage to increase to 100MB  100MB = "virtually unlimited"?

						   Sergey Brin says POP3 capability is coming to GMail:  urlLink Google's Brin Talks on Gmail Future : "No, I think that's an important question. And in fact, as we're working on providing forwarding [and] POP3, that's an important consideration there as well. I don't have a great answer; we're still brainstorming. "  Also Brin suggests that the beta period will be "3 to 6 months":  How long do you think this beta feedback process is going to be?   I think it'll take three to six months or so. We're getting a lot of good feedback; we've already made a number of changes. Probably the big ones are feature requests that we need to deal with, and there are some significant ones there. I don't know how many of those we'll be able to get in prior to making it more broadly available.

You can also leave your comments in any of the other threads or trackback and I'll check out your blog.  Just because a site has the name "GMail" in it doesn't mean it has anything to do with GMail.

						   It would seem that Gmail invites are no longer as sought after as they once were. The market for folks selling them is not what it once was and you can talk to several folks who have Gmail invites and are willing to give them away. Sites like Gmailswap are not going to last much longer in this type of market.  Also I've removed the ability to add anonymous comments. It's lame when people don't leave their names.

						   This is true that 14% of my Gmail space is gone now. For those who are wondering what type of contest we'll have for the Gmail invites please plan to tune into the radio show this Friday where we'll be kicking it around there and actually be giving at least one Gmail invite away.  Remember that I started tracking my spam situation in Gmail on  urlLink May 16  which is only three weeks ago. Let's call it 15% and say that I'm using about 5% of space per week on average. That means the Gmail space is going to run out in approximately 20 weeks, not even half a year.  I guess the 2-3 years estimation was for very, very casual email users because I'm not even sending all of our email to it and it won't last a half year at current spam throughput.

						   I know what the spammers are thinking:  hey, let's send our spam on Friday or Saturday so it gets read by the folks who work all week and are home to relax on the weekends.    Perhaps their response rate is higher from some folks on these days, but from past experience I come prepared to mass delete the inbox with very, very little attention on the weekends. False positives likelihood for us traditionally have been higher on the weekend, but it has been a necessary road bump.  No more.  I'm hoping that by using Gmail to be able to use to ferret out the good from the bad it will be easier with their fast search.

A while back, I noticed that the JavaScript in GMail started to change the page title (and thus the tab title if you use a tabbed browser) to include the number of unread email messages - a small detail, but something that I was anticipating. Just now, I logged in with Apple's Safari browser and noticed that I no longer received an unsupported browser warning. Cool."

						   If you are sight-impaired then waiting for Gmail to release a more accessible version could be the only option.  urlLink Gmail accessibility [dive into mark] : Furthermore, the most innovative feature of Gmail the global keyboard shortcuts appears to have been designed by vi users (j moves down, k moves up, and we are expected to memorize multi-key sequences for navigation). Yet by using fake links everywhere, Gmail throws away the most basic web feature, breaks useful browser-level innovations like Mozilla's Find as you type, and breaks third-party products like JAWS and WindowEyes. So the target market for Gmail appears to be vi users who use Internet Explorer, and have a working pair of eyes. In short, the only way to use Gmail is the way that the Gmail designers use Gmail. The only way Gmail could be less accessible is if the entire site were built in Flash. Update April 13, 2004: Kevin Fox, a user interface designer at Google, says Google is aware of these problems, and that accessibility is very important to them.

						   Wow, was just looking over the stats and I've noticed a significant dropoff from traffic surrounding this blog. From this I can deduce one or more of the following possibilities:  1) people feel that this blog is boring and/or is no longer worth reading 2) people already have a Gmail account and don't want to talk or read about it 3) the bulk of the traffic was only interested in getting a Gmail invite and figured this would be a good place to find one. (I do actually have some invites still, BTW). 4) saturation from other Gmail-related blogs and websites. There are a lot of them out there, though I notice a pattern of them starting to die slow deaths. 5) fill in the blank: ___________  I'll continue to update this blog as there are new things in the Gmail-sphere to talk about. If there is a Gmail-related topic that you, gentle reader, are specifically interested in then please use the comment area to tell me about it.  And BTW, I have now used over 70% of my 1 gig of Gmail space.

Whenever we sent out email to non-existant Gmail email accounts from non Gmail addresses or even in Gmail address, we do not get any Permanent errors or fatal error messages back to the senders address which is normally the case. As per Karan, they store the emails.  What makes it quite interesting is that someone signed on as {username}@Gmail.com and found over a 100 e-mails waiting for him on his first login, some from as long as 2 months back. Apparently someone had been mistakenly sending emails to this {username} and the emails seem to have been stored up  . "
