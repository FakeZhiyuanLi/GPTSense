       today was an okay day, i suppose. most days are. i happen to have a sunny disposition. make that very sunny. i got to sleep late today. a very strange thing happens to me often in the summer...i wake up, and it's really bright outside, and my first thought is "oh, my gosh, it is like 11 AM and i was supposed to be at work at 9:30!!" then i&nbsp;get up, all in a tizzy (i love that expression, by the way),&nbsp;and i rush into the bathroom to see that it's only 8AM and i could have slept another hour, but oh well, i'm already up. yep, summer's almost over. i started reading my third summer reading book today. i'm proud of me. last summer i waited til like now to start reading my three books. but not this summer. this summer all i've procrastinated on is the writing of my essay and the answering of the questions. and, come to think of it, that's a lot to be done. oh well, i'll do it tomorrow.

       the future. that's a lot to think about. and the word "future" is very broad: it could mean tomorrow, next week, next month, the next year, the rest of your life...i have a bright future, i believe. but i also believe that you make your own future and that no one else can choose it for you. there are a lot of choices to make that concern the future, and when i make a lot of these choices i am not in my right mind, but i pray that i pick what's best. i try not too plan too much because where's the fun in that? but right now i just want the days to fly by so october 21 will go ahead and get here. i'm ready to be 16. i'm ready to have my car and my freedom. and, i am even ready to have my responsibility. but i have to wait. i have to wait 91 more days. that, my friends, is a long time. my perception of time is so skewed. i think 6 months is like forever ago and that what i was like a month ago was so different and so long ago. i change a lot. all the time, i am changing. the friends that can keep up are the ones that stay. i make friends easily but good ones are hard to find. luckily i have found some really good ones. scratch that, some really great ones. life is good :o)

       my daddy used to be so cool. i used to be daddy's little girl. not anymore. sadly, my father and i do not get along anymore. if we spend more than like an hour together all hell breaks loose. sort of. i get punished for the stupidest things. and now i havethe hiccups. interesting.  feelings of sadness, sweeping confusion overcome me as&nbsp;i look at the man who is my father the man who is proud of me, his only daughter who punishes, protects, and loves me, his only daughter but he's not daddy not the man i knew as a child the big blue eyes of a toddler stare up at daddy with his huge smile and loving eyes the scrawny body of a second-grader lies next to daddy as he talks about his favorite bands the sassy eyes of an eleven-year-old roll at daddy while he talks about having patience when fishing but now my stern voice asks my father "what happened to the man i called daddy?"

       have faith in what?  the reasoning of a child  from a man's mind  the drugs had worn off  the bloodshot eyes searched  wearily  they would stop searching soon   life's still worth living  the reassuring words  from a girl's heart  the hope fading away  the worried eyes love  tenderly  they will never stop loving     **written for &amp; dedicated to Cory**

       i've been thinking a lot lately about friends. friends are so important, and i have some of the best. they love me and they aren't ashamed of me, which is hard to do, because if i were my friend, i'd be ashamed of me. i mean, i'm not the most popular gal on the planet. to be quite honest, i am the furthest thing from it. i dress weird (flip-flops & t-shirts year round, baby), i act weird (you should see the embarassing things i put myself through), and i just am weird. but my friends love me nonetheless. and that's so awesome. i love you guys, too! there are a lot of quotes out there about friendship, but i'm just gonna share two of my favorites. the first one is from a little card that my friend's mom gave me way back in the third grade. it's pretty self-explanatory: "there's a miracle called friendship that dwells within the heart, and you don't know how it happens or where it gets its start, but the happiness it brings you always gives a special lift, and you realize that friendship is God's most precious gift." the second quote is from the Bible, and it is also quoted in john steinbeck's great-american novel, the grapes of wrath. Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 : "two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor. for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up." friends help friends out. they are always there for each other. it's hard to be there sometimes. when one of my friend's counsins committed suicide, i didn't know what to tell her. i didn't know how to comfort her or how to make the pain go away. she completely shut down. i wrote this poem about the whole situation, i'm not sure if she knows about it, but i guess she will now...  it's selfish and it's stupid and everything between and to the right and to the left of every word you didn't mean it hurts and it aches and i bet you didn't know and i'm mad and i'm sad but only because i loved you so it makes  and it breaks everything i ever knew it's hazy but it's clear there's just one thing left to do i aim and i shoot and now it's all gone down the drain it's over and it's starting there is no end to the pain  **RIP Matt**

       that's right, it's the first official day of the weekend. during the school year, friday is like a big deal. but in the summer, most of the time i don't even know what day of the week it is. or even what day of the month, and sometimes even what month it is. i am just your average clueless teenager in the summer. but not in the school year. me and rach made up this friday song, cause we love fridays so much: "duhnuhnuhnuhnuhnana IT'S FRIDAY!" now, it may seem silly, but it does make your friday a little a more interesting when you're walking down a crowded hallway singing that. and you know i love to be interesting. yeah, me and rach, we're two crazy girls. she's boy-crazy, i'm just normal crazy.

       Meagan is one of my best friends. she's great. she calls me hayes, i call her hose. we just go together...hayes and hose. that's the way it's been for like the past year. and hopefully for many years to come...  i wrote this for her, or about her rather...   the tiny hands  wringing  out of confusion, guilt, frustration  the smooth eyelids  fluttering  out of contempt, anger, hatred  the weak muscles  contracting  out of mistrust, disbelief, shock  the loving heart  breaking  out of longing, desire, love  my eyes watch  as&nbsp;i try to dry the tears  all i can do  whisper  "i love you and everything will be all right"  but my voice cracks  with the uncertainty  that is certain   **dedicated to Meagan~04/14/04**

       that's right, somebody managed to piss me off yesterday. i was so mad i was shaking. it was not cool. ok, so i am a lifeguard and i work at east ridge country club (ercc). at work, we sit for twenty minutes out in the hot heat and watch the pool, then we get time off when the other lifeguards that are there are serving their twenty minutes. well, i was sitting outside, and it happened to be a hotter- and humider-than average day yesterday, and my twenty minutes goes by pretty quickly. but woah, hold up, another twenty minutes goes by and neither erik nor adrienne has shown up to relieve me. so at this point i am a little upset, especially because i can see them in the break room just sitting there looking at me, knowing what they were doing. and yet, another twenty minutes goes by. this time they decide to show. and as i am walking towards the break room erik has the audacity to ask me if i would like to stay outside  longer . what a retard! i reply, as calmly as i can, no, thank you, and just to let you know, you two will be out there for two hours...an hour for you and an hour for you" and i walk inside and sit and shake. i was furious. oh, by the way, adrienne and erik are buddy-buddy and prefer to do their shifts together, i guess they don't realize that that means they do twice the time because i am not cutting my break time short because they want to serve simultaneously. oh, and my boss was perfectly ok with me leaving them out there. he even encouraged it. after an hour had passed adrienne walks inside and says, trying to be nice, "haley, we've been out there for an hour and you were out there for an hour so would yuo come and take your turn?" me: "haha, no, i told you an hour each. you've served your hour, leave erik out there." and yes, my tone was a little harsh but people take way too much advantage of my niceness. adrienne often gets me to switch shifts with her so i end up working in the afternoons when i much prefer the mornings. erik has left me outside for an hour before. i'm starting to really dislike that erik character. he's very selfish. so after a few minutes pass and adrienne goes back outside erik comes in, trying to be all authoritative, "haley, you're up. we've been out there for an hour." me: "sorry buddy no can do. i warned you, and i wasn't joking." christian backs me up (christian is my boss): "you knew what you were doing." so i got my two hours off, and that was  nice.  but i was still really pissed off.

       so umm yeah...it's not cool when you're calling your friend at 2:38am and their mom's boyfriend answers, in his always-intimidating voice "who's this?" let's just say i was scared poop-less. that man is scary. so yeah i won't be doing that anymore. but see, it wouldn't have happened if cory would have just answered the phone. and he wouldn't have had to just answer the phone if he had just told me what the heck he was thinking about. then i wouldn't have been forced to hang up on him. i mean, i gave him a fair warning and told him i would. and i am a girl of my word. so i did. well, i just hope he isn't too mad at me. i do feel bad, but mostly for waking danny up. so cory, when you read this, which i know you eventually will: i'm sorry. and i just tried to call you but i guess you weren't home. i kinda wanted to go to target with you. but i guess that just didn't work out. sorry babe. i love you LOTS, k?

       i just got back from taco bell. i have eaten taco bell for the last four days in a row. tonight i felt that i needed it. i swear it is addictive. i mean, i made my boyfriend, ryan, come and get me and take me there just cause i wanted it that bad. man, i am pathetic. by the way, as of today, ryan and i have been dating for 4 weeks. that's a long time for me. i haven't managed to scare him off yet, and i am thankful. he's such a sweet guy and he treats me well. i really am happy with him. YAY! i just felt like doing that...anyways. so yeah, 4 weeks. long time. now on to ponder whether fast food can really be addictive...

       slowly but surely i am beginning to realize what i mean to other people. a lot of times, people don't understand that they are  important.  i didn't for a long time. but i do now. you think you need other people to hold you up and keep you going, but if you weren't there, they would fall too. i don't know if you follow what i'm saying or understand what i'm talking about here. but  friendship  is the basis of all that is worth anything to live for in this life. my friends are my rocks upon which i stand. and now i know and understand that i support them as well. and it's a beautiful thing. way to sound cheesy, haley. but hey, it's the honest truth. all this i am realizing thanks to Meagan, who is making me feel more loved than i thought anybody could. she means so much to me, and i can't imagine life without my cute, giggly Meagan. so hose, this one's for you...   Honey you are a rock  Upon which I stand  And I come here to talk  I hope you understand  The green eyes, yeah the spotlight, shines upon you  And how could, anybody, deny you?  I came here with a load  And it feels so much lighter now I met you  And honey you should know  That I could never go on without you  Green eyes  Honey you are the sea  Upon which I float  And I came here to talk  I think you should know  The green eyes, you're the one that I wanted to find  And anyone who tried to deny you, must be out of their mind  Because I came here with a load  And it feels so much lighter since I met you  Honey you should know  That I could never go on without you  Green eyes, green eyes  Honey you are a rock  Upon which I stand    **green eyes by coldplay**

       ...but for some reason, i always blame myself.   i almost quit my job today. i'm not a good lifeguard, or so i have convinced myself. i was watching the pool and there were maybe 8 children swimming. my stand is closer to the deep end, and the copetes (these two brothers that i love) were playing categories with their friend, sam. so i was somewhat distracted by that. however, i noticed a girl and her brother swimming in the shallow end. the girl was maybe 6 and her brother probably 8 or maybe even 9. she could not swim at all and he could swim fairly well. she was staying near the four foot mark and he kept swimming on into deeper water. well, she kept calling his name. "nathan! nathan!" i don't know what she wanted, she is a clingy child. well, the copetes were distracting me for about 3 minutes and the next thing i know, erica opens the grill door and shouts, "haley, watch the pool!" i see the mother of the two children with the daughter on the side of the pool. i suppose the mother had to grab the child because she was "drowning". but she must not have been too panicky, because i didn't hear her even screaming for nathan anymore. well, maybe i just tuned that out because, boy, it was annoying. man, that mother gave me the go-to-hell look. she came up to me,&nbsp;after putting on the girl's floatie suit (because she obviously can't swim),&nbsp;still giving me that look, "did you even see that she was in trouble?" all i could say was, "no ma'am, i'm sorry, i was distracted." i meant to add "by watching the other children in the pool" but the words just wouldn't come out, i was on the verge of tears. then she blames it on me "well, you need to watch, it's hard for me, as a mother, to do." umm, ok, you're watching the two that are your responsibility, which you accepted by getting pregnant and giving birth to them, and i have to watch like 10. i know it is my job to&nbsp;watch, and i try my best, but sometimes i just get distracted.&nbsp;and if she knew the child couldn't swim, she should have put her in the floatie suit before the girl got in the pool. that would have made a lot more sense. so, i am convincing myself that it was just an accident, but i still don't know how much longer i can handle the responsibility of others' lives.

       so let me tell you a little something about my day. well, several little somethings. i stayed on the phone with my boyfriend until 5-something this morning. we weren't tired and we just felt like talking, i suppose. i love talking to him :o) then i went to sleep. well i woke up at like 10, had a birthday party to go to at 10:30. i took a shower and watched my brother for a while when my mother ran to the store to get tape. it was easy watching him, he was passed out in his crib. nice and quiet. then we woke him up and went to the party. this was not your average party, it was a birthday party for a five year old. oh boy, what fun! umm, if you think listening to a bunch of little kids running around screaming is fun, then sure. but personally, not me. but i did get to hang with my second family for a while. i love those awesome people! well then i went home and talked to ryan for like an hour while trying to register for the SAT and then getting yelled at by mother for not doing it right or quick enough or something and then getting yelled at by my father for speaking to my mother in "such a manner." oh yes, that was just how i wanted my afternoon to be. well, i went to work at 3. thunder, lightning, storms...awesome! i sat around and did NOTHING for 3.88 hours and got paid to do it. finally, they let us leave because, well, no one was gonna go swimming for the rest of the day. erica took me home. it was really nice of her. she cracks me up. but now i got nothing to do, so i guess i better try to register for that dumb test again...

       well i woke up at 6:30 to my boss calling to say we're not going to lifeguard the triathlon. kinda disappointing. so then i went back to sleep. and i woke up at 10 to help momma with the groceries. then i had to work in the yard for an hour and a half in the hot heat. then i had to clean inside for a while. then i took a shower. momma called and i asked her if, for a reward for all my hard labor, i could have the new taking back sunday CD. when she said yes i got this sudden burst of energy. i swear i could've run around the block 400 times. so then, because i was greatful, i cleaned even more. oh and my grandmother gave me $140 for new clothes and stuff. i can't describe the energy i had then. then i went to barnes and noble. ryan came and spent a little time with me, he even bought me a cookie. :oP I LOVE COOKIES. i read a lot of my book today. i'm proud of me. i just need to finish it soon and get started on those God-forsaken questions and that essay. my God, so much to do!

       this song is on jewel's first CD, pieces of you, which was released in 1994. i've had this CD forever and i still love it. jewel was 15 years old when she wrote these songs. this is my favorite one from the CD...  please don't say i love you those words touch me much too deeply and they make my core tremble don't think you realize the power you have over me and please don't come so close it just makes me want to make you near me always please don't kiss me so sweet it makes me crave a thousand kisses to follow and please don't touch me like that makes every other embrace seem pale and shallow please don't look at me like that it just makes me want to make you near me always please don't send me flowers they only whisper the sweet things you'd say don't try to understand me your hands already know too much anyway it just makes me want to make you near me always and when you look in my eyes please know my heart is in your hands it's nothing that i understand, but when in your arms you have complete power over me so be gentle if you please cause your hands are in my hair, but my heart is in your teeth and it makes me want to make you near me always i want to be near you always i want to be near you always i want to be near you always  **near you always~jewel**

       i've decided i want to raise my family in oak park, illinois. it's a beautiful, safe town right outside of chicago. it's perfect. i'm going to go to school, work for a few years, save lots of money, then buy a house in oak park. this was frank lloyd wright's home for twenty years, and i hope it wil be mine. it's a nice place, somewhere that's got charm and even entertainment. and it's really close to the city of my dreams, chicago. i'll be able to go to the city and i'll be able to feel safe at home. but yet the most attractive thing about this place is frank. his influence is everywhere. and his 25 structures magnificently grace this humble settlement. oh man, the good life is but seven years away.  when you travel, you've got a lot of time to think. and i sure have been using it. i've thought a lot about ryan and how much he means to me. i've thought a lot about my friends and where i'd be without them. the answer to that is quite simple: somewhere else. but i wanna be here, right where i am. happiness has found me and i'm afraid to lose it. life is good. remember that. also, i've thought about school and how it's only a week away. and then i think about the book i have to finish reading and the essay i have to write and the questions i have to answer...

       yes, i admit it, i have a little black book. my little black book is very special to me, and it is always right beside my bed, in case i may need it in the middle of the night. my little black book has a name, one that i gave it. S.P.I.T. yes, that is its lovely name::songs, poems, ideas, & thoughts::  where would i be without my little black book? i'm not sure, but i like it here. i haven't written in it in a while. it's quite sad, actually. i just haven't found any inspiration. but to make up for my lack of creativity, i am going to share with you what lies between the two covers of my little black book. when i first began to write in it, i thought it would be my sacred treasure. but i feel i need to share things with the world. so here goes.  there's an introduction with my name(which has already been posted on this site) there's a little poetic passage i wrote **tasting the remains of sweet and sour chicken. watching john mayer on the tube. bright    colors whirling. my eyes dance. searching for the beat of the long lost song. playing over and over again in my head. the beat:remarkable. the words:forgotten. stil searching.** "never saw blue like that"~shawn colvin poem for cory (already posted) quote to cory **"i can't make you see, you've seen too much" suicide letter from cory (none of your business really, it means a lot to me personally since he did not follow through) camelia poem (already posted) daddy poem (already posted) poem for meagan (already posted) silly poem i wrote out of boredom (i won't share it with you) Bible quote-Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 quote by me **"people don't take the time. always rush, rush, rush. they know who they know and never meet anyone new. they suffer because of it. they get tired of life, they don't realize they can change, they just get stuck and go crazy"** quote by my father (directed towards me) **"you and me are a lot alike. we see beauty in the same things."** Bible quote-Ecclesiastes 7:20**for there is not a just man on earth who does good and does not sin** bedtime prayer poem (from where "As i lay me down to sleep..." originated) RIP matt poem (already posted) "remember when it rained"~josh groban Lydia poem (already posted) crime poem (already posted) poem for michael (none of your business...) i finally defined love **how do you know when someone loves you? that someone tolerates everything about you but they absolutely adore the things you hate about yourself.** "bats in the belfry"~dispatch apology for not writing insomnia poem (already posted) "a murder of one"~counting crows

       Lydia (inspired by Mary Cassatt's painting, "Lydia in a Loge, Wearing a Pearl Necklace")  eyes cast away caught on soemthing in the distance focusing almost a smile as the two lips part and the corners are upward turning flowers upon her chest and entangled in the hair behind her hair neatly tucked silk fan in the hand upon a gown of rose and lace resting only the finest pearls touching her ivory skin smooth as silk and soft as petals glowing irridescent in the light shining from behind and up above where the crowd sits watching and yet the eyes are cast away caught on something in the distance     crime (the robbing of innocence)  the walls are like ice numbing to the touch water trickles down leaving behind its thin trail of green goby slime drip-drop-drip-drop to the floor each dew kiss falls drip-drop all its purity robbed by the grime of the ground the only light is magnified by the glorious droplets until drip-drop all goodness is gone escaped in that instant when the tiny tear joins the pool darkness the light of the world innocence gone in an instant in one heartbeat, one blink of an eye i am alone

       ayyy mama mia! ok, i know that was a random expression of "i need stress relief!!" life is still good, though. i got back from chicago yesterday and it seems not too much has been going on. pretty much the same ole same ole. i've been trying to work on my school assignments but i just can't concentrate. you know how that is, we all know how that is. i got my chicago pictures developed and i'm thinking i may scan some and upload them to the blog. sound good? ok then it's settled. now when i'll have time to do that is questionable. i'm excited about school, though. i love seeing everybody and making new friends. fun fun fun! well, so it will actually be fun and i won't be stressed because i didn't finish my assignments, i am going to go work on them right now. well, soon anyways...

       so yesterday was the first day of school. i like my schedule, only one thing is really wrong with it. i have no classes or lunch with my meagan!!!!!! that is soooooooooo wrong! oh i was mad. well, today was cool. i didn't have to go to school. all the freshies did! haha on them! i went school supply shopping with my mommy today. and then we went to lunch at (drum roll please) strawns! yippee. then i helped her install some stuff around the house. then i had to do homework! after the first day of school, how disturbing! and ryan stopped by on the way to work and we just kissed like once and my mom drives up! but she didn't care that he had stopped by. which is good. then meg and i went school shopping and out to country tavern! that's where we always go! hehe and the ribs are sooo good. almost as good as the rib shack, but not quite. well, i guess i better go. nothin else to say really.~haley~

       so i've come up with the plan. not just a plan, THE plan. i'm going to become a nihilist. that way i don't believe in homework. :: "haley, why don't you have your homework?" :: "i'm a nihilist." and when i fail, i can sue the school for going against my personal beliefs of nihilism. and then i'll make neough money to support me for life. whoohoo.  but really and seriously, today wasn't that bad. i guess. i liked the assignment we had in english. i think ms. guillot was impressed as well. it was to write a paragraph explaining your definition of truth. would you like to read it? i think you would...      Truth is a standard. It is a standard given to any information. For something to reach the level of truth, it must be absolute. If something is of truth, it does not change. It reamins faithful to the virtues with which it began. Truth is the way things really are, regardless of the disguise they may hide behind. Truth can be counted on. It remains constant and is the level at which nothing more can be discovered. Truth occurs when there is nothing left to find abd nothing can change any longer. In this world, there is no truth.
