						    Once Your Sneakers Throw You  (to Something Corporate and Pepper Ann. I have my reasons.)  Here I am. That’s what he said. It’s a foggy night. The mist burns my eyes. It’s a long way down. Are you sure about this? Once your sneakers throw you, You forget how to fly. Don’t you wish You were still a little kid? Now what have you got to show?  Superman doesn’t rescue suckers.  Just so you know.

						    Matthew’s Town  (In the style of Anne Carson...I have gotten a lot of praise on this one, as old and as simple as it is. Then again, words never really age and it is pretty complex now that I think about it. Anyway, it seems to have been a favorite so check it out.)  She has never looked better. He decides. She is beautiful. Golden braids. Sunny night. He smiles as she. Sleeps. She never liked him anyway. She’s in. His bed.

						    A Love Song from Andy  (An old school poem of mine...)   Today, she asked me if I liked him. Where’s his lighter? His blonde hair? You look so cute together. Too bad you don’t know how To hold hands. Need a hand? Wow, thanks for the necklace. I do like chocolate milk. I’m glad you agree. And now, I can see him Three doors down. As he approaches– I know. I know. I know. He’s yours. He’ll ask me again, Then provide me with the hug. The one you wanted. I’m sorry. Excuse me for a minute, While I go throw up. Hold this for me. Too bad you don’t know how To hold hands.

						    A Chrysalis Catharsis  (For Matt)  How am I supposed to pull this off? This whole, perfect girl thing? How am I going to stay your butterfly– your baby bat? I’m none of that. Neither are you, that’s what I like about you. But I can deal with change. I breathe change. But will you love everything I’m changing back into? I’m crawling back into my chrysalis and morphing from your butterfly into a caterpillar. One of those prickly ones. My leathery wings are tearing. . .

						   Written and Revised on Christmas Day 2003. For Vinnie, who may be the only person to ever have heard what's written between these lines.  Something is being held out to me by the hands that have cradled me for so long. I’ve been standing on my own two feet for the last six months or so. And still I can’t lift anymore weight than the little I am.  To take it would, in a way,  lighten my load. 		(For the moment) 		But as all time, that moment would soon 		slip away. 						(Losing my balance.) Then I’m burdened with the aftershocks and consequences and the Did that really happen? and the grin, and the dot. dot. dot. and the Goodbye. and the Hello. and the Yes, I screwed this over. and the Goodbye. 		    (For good.) 		    Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.  I think it would be easier, not to kiss the hands that I feed from, but rather,  to bite them. Sink my teeth in. Sip. Sip. Sip. And I’ll chew on the bones like the dog I am. I’m savoring all of this, you know. Though this has cost me the sweetest, (ripest) fruit, your juices fit better on my tongue. 		     (Always.)   And now those hands pick me apart, slip in under my skin. Tearing off pieces of my face and placing them in my hand. Am I really that cold?  If I drop myself will that lighten my load? 		    (For good.)

						    My Artificial Night   I can see why Juliet loved her Romeo. I would have wooed him, too and made him forget the name Sweet Rosaline and taken the blinds and the curtains and drapes and created my own artificial night as he wooed and I wept and wanted him back.  (Maybe  I should put my armor back on.)

						    White Boy  "All he could think about was, I'm too young for this. Got my whole life ahead. Hell, I'm just a kid myself. HOW AM I GONNA RAISE ONE?" -Kenny Chesney  White boy. Bright flame. Stab yourself. Take the blame.  The cocoon is torn, new wings emerge. Broken and spit-on, bruised by the urge.  The flame will pour from between the lips of the boy with the chains  and the womb with the whips.  And the tip of the tongue begins to bleed. The blood is dirty. The flame will feed  upon the skin under which he crawls. He tries to run. He trips. She falls.  Never born  can never fly. Nothing tastes good once you lie.  Slowly learning  how to die. Holding hands with a burning butterfly.

						   (I'd dedicate this one to my Mom...though she'll never know.)  This is the borderline of crying. No, this is crying.  Why do you insist on tugging the tears from me till I’m empty? 					And still trying to suppress my anger. 					The rage that I’ve been keeping 					bottled up for so long. I’d love to drown you in it, spill it all over your body– your soul–that little round glowing orb. I’d love to smother it with poison so it shrivels up and wilts like those fucking flowers on that fucking wreath where the dartboard used to be. I’m sorry I didn’t have perfect aim. I’m sorry I ever started this game. YOU ASKED ME TO PLAY!  Well fine. I’ll never let you win again. 					(Gulping down my bottle of regret, now.)

						    Suspension (of the Senses)  This is the chorus of the song Greg is creating for me :-D.  This is me in the school cafeteria, standing, being pulled up onto the table  by you. This is not a suspension (but of my senses.) This is my petition– signed by two: 	Me and you.

						   (For Mike. Obviously.)  I hope you choke on every kiss She plants square on your lips. I hope that when you try to swallow them down, They get stuck in your throat. (Still kissing frogs?) And never again will you be able to taste Anything so sweet (as your lies) As me… Not to mention the kisses that are killing you softly,  Breathing all your air.  God, I hate being right. Especially  when you knew all along But still pretended I was wrong. God, I hate your frog-digesting, kiss-infected guts. Go ahead and leave again. And this time,  It won’t be you I’m lusting after. Bastard.  I’ll be sitting here (Type. Type. Type.) creating my angry teenage poetry. Punching walls And punching keys.  And you’ll be out there, Somewhere, Or better yet, IN. In everyone you come across, Including Jess– Your best friend. I love the was you talk about How you’re so close When the space between you Is bigger than you think you are. When you finally get together And kill that thing called SPACE, Let me know How much SPACE you allowed for between your bellies, Between your thick skin.  So yes, you’re once again IN. How does it feel? I bet it’s mighty satisfying, With a small side of regret. And with one more girl, That will lust after you. And maybe a few more angry teenage poems.

						    Ashes   Your fingertips glide Along the valley that is my stomach, Any my entire body cringes. Nerves explode. I ignite.  (You are amazing.) This blazing fire Brightens the room.  At first all I see is desire. At first all I see is want. But I look again. I see time. Regret, maybe, that crumples time.

						    Just   Just slit my wrist And in you slip– Under my skin. You like tickling me from inside, don’t you? Don’t you like playing in the pools of my hot blood? (I’m hot for you.)   Just change this. Just change me back from North to South. Repel me. (I thrive on your attraction.) I’m not as bipolar as I thought I was.  I’m just like a lovesick puppy, following you around. (Maybe I’m just sick.)  Just purr, Because, Kitten, us dogs, we don’t. Nuzzle against me, Rumble my chest. Stir up my blood.  Let’s just make this up as we go along. Let’s just.

						    To My Mind   Night is creeping along your back. (Like black ants in their track. In their line.) Soon it will shadow you,                      Shelter you completely. The darkness grows and grows, And soon I’ll lift it up, Let a little beam of light Blind you for a split second. I’ll crawl underneath the sheets with you, And you’ll wrap your shadow-stained arms   (Pale now, more pale than ever.) Around my middle. (Tightly now, more tightly than ever.) There are cobwebs gathering in the corners here. Where was I all your life?  Eventually some of me Will leave my body, Numbing the nerves I’ll no longer own. Eventually everything of mine that you’ve endured Will leave even you. (After X number of years).  Memory is everything.  Lick me all over,  Taste everything,  Even my memory. Kiss all the places where you’ve licked my skin away. (Mend me.)  I’ll lose myself to you. I’ll give you the egg And you be the fetus. You do the math. (The addition                               To our family.) Our family itself.  I’m still leaving through the slits On my wrists. Like an adulteress though her window. (Back to her lacy spider web.  Tie me up now, tie me up more tightly than ever.)

						    Due Time pt. II  (for Patt)  I want you   to know that my mind is like a magnet and you’re the refrigerator door.  That weird texture to you– I’d like to run my fingers along it, as it melts and twists into the shape of your face.  My fingers brush your pink lips, like an A on a test paper, stuck up on the fridge– Triumphant. but not too proud.  Something someone has earned. Something someone has 	      to show what they have learned.  Your lips are my teachers, and I crave knowledge, wisdom. Happiness. (Can that be taught?)  Keep speaking! I want to know everything! I want you to show me. I want a little red A to kiss.  I want you.

						    Sloppy Seconds (The Long Kiss Goodnight)   Is this my long kiss goodnight? Because my lips are left alone. Resting unparted and untouched. Is this what I’m left to live with? And sleep with? This phantom that won’t touch me? I’ve always thought that those memories come back to life for the better. Well I guess I was wrong cause nothing is worse than this enticing nothing. The leftovers of a venomous kiss. What if I don’t want sloppy seconds?  I don’t know.  Maybe I’m overreacting. But you gave me reason to 		in giving me nothing at all.

						   This one's becoming a song thanks to Greg (:-D) so look out for it.  She can wear a white shirt like nothing’s ever been so white. Like nothing’s ever been so sexy. Her hair falls in all the right places, curling on it’s way down her back, like water trickling over rubies. As succulent, as red and the apple that Eve plucked and polished and ate. 	…her tool for sin… 	…her tool for sin… Walking beside her while she glows with all my energy In her whites and her blacks.  She makes me feel so ugly, so plain and boring and dusty. So unclean and unwanted, I try a little spit-shine, to maybe catch all the Adams’ eyes. It’s not that they don’t see me. It’s not that they don’t look me up and down. It’s just that she’s so much better at being a girl.

						    Closure (From Here on Out)  (for Mike...that's right, MIKE.)  From here on out, my every heartbeat will be devoted to someone else.  From here on out  I dedicate myself to a worthier cause. To a cause that’s not engaged; and from here on in,  my heart will be sealed 		with a juicier kiss. A kiss that will inspire more than lustful feelings.  From here on out I’ll remember  the difference between a breath and a scream 		and that they both ran out 		of ecstasy.

						    Aye, Pilgrim!   At least I said Goodnight tonight before I said goodbye. God I love the way you nuzzle the air as if someone was there when I scratch your head and play with your hair. But, Love, I must admit Love isn’t Love unless we can handle this shit. We have knots to comb out, we have rough lips to smooth with Romeo’s Holy Palmer’s kiss. Aye, Pilgrim! God I love the way you sin and the trouble you always get us in. Too bad I still hate everything.

						    Kiss Space  (To “Brian that Guy”)  I don’t know what it was exactly. Something about lacing myself all up all over. And what? Did I actually think that I could be all over you? Because I’m pretty sure my fingers were still laced through his. Woven.  [Kiss space] I liked how you kissed me on the cheek and how you planted the kiss more in that empty space between my cheek and my neck. Only a fool allows a stranger to kiss her (neck). Well, I guess then, Stranger, I’m foolish.  Play with me again, Stranger. Help unwind these bindings  			To him, 			My everything.  (Unravel)     (Me)

						    Indestructible and Sweet    (to Vampire)  It’s sweet Like raspberries and orange juice. Like how you can call me Princess and get away with it. Like plucking the petals from a flower, thinking, Please let him love me! How can he not? Maybe every flower wasted  on wishes and worried little girls will come back and haunt you. (Boo…BOO!) At least when you wish on stars (like me) we’re not wasted and scattered around your feet. It drives me insane when you poke at mine. I’m as ticklish as sin. Just as I am invincible.  Us stars, we shoot (through the sky)  LIKE THE CRY OF A PISTOL.  Nothing’s as convincing as the point of a pin and the wiry tree I can scratch into the palm of my hand, when I’m hiding in the corner where no one can find me. I’m invisible. I’m indestructible and sweet Like raspberries and orange juice. Like a star’s defeat.

						    Is it raining in California?  (Just the chorus of a really long song I've been working on for a while... oh yeah and this one is for Ant, too.)  Is it raining in California or clear enough to see our moon? Are you surfing over crashing waves or sitting silently on the roof?  Thinking of me, and the way it was before...                             surface on the shore                            wash up to my front door  I'll dry you off and wrap my arms around you. We can make out in the Massachusetts rain.  Let's run away.

						    A Million Miles  (for Ant, wherever you are)  A million miles A gazillion footsteps away I’ve never ever cared so much~  I’ll never forget the way we made out on the rooftop under the white hot moon. MXPX playing in through the window to my room– 	A love song about two people 	A million miles (a gazillion footsteps) away 	from each other Both in the dark curled under the covers giggling out loud in the night.  The echoes of the beeping when the text messages came through. 	(Nothing better to do.) 	(There is nothing better than you.)   Two people- Shaking with anticipation Wishing they could just wrap themselves in someone else’s arms (and lips).  But still I’ll never forget how I’d sit on the rooftop listening to MXPX play softly in my ear Looking at the same moon that you were looking at, too.

He soothes my blood, his mystery fills my lungs and I'm already addicted. I fit so perfectly like lock and key– he opens me. I want to hug him forever and soak all his toxins in, my little cigarette. He turns me on, I light him up, and everything's fine. I miss him so much. I need another drag so I can sit still. One more kiss from the lips of my little cigarette. Fighting these cravings, God, do I crave him. Friends like a thousand surgeon generals screaming from the pages of magazines and time. But I'll inhale him all. He's mine. My little cigarette.

						    Grey Grey Actor and Other Grey Things                    Written and Revised April 1, 2004  There actually are more than fourteen shades of grey. And though  I still don't know for sure  what grey matter is, I'm sure my body is covered in it. I'm sure it's multiplying by the minute. After attending a musical I curl up with my grey. After attending a musical starring all my friends– the stars–little grey stars-–my friends being stared in the eye so straightly by a silver-eyed, brown-haired actor. Humor emits from his ears and his eyes– he doesn't blink,  Why won't he blink?  Grey matter in his mouth Grey matter on his cheeks. I'm sure it's been multiplying for weeks. A grey grey actor soiled costume, disheveled brown-hair brown-hair and grey-eyes grey-eyes stare. stare.  WHY WON'T HE BLINK?  I still don't know for sure  what grey matter is but it peels away at his eyelids and leaves me grinning like an idiot and I blush– I'm sure my blood is silver, too, though I'm no unicorn. No magician. No actor. Just a grey little girl lost in a moment wondering why wondering what any of this even has to do with the color grey.

						    Mad Season/In Your Mouth (The Fuck Yourself Poem)  Written 4.2.04, Revised 4.3.04 (and again...take it as you will...)  I'll bleed all over you then try not to look while you fuck yourself. The sound of water rumbling in the pipes inside the wall– you washed a little bit of liquid-me and whatever else– flint rocks flint rocks Fucking stop it! You're sparking me. You're sparking me! Masturbation is a silly thing like bleeding in someone else's mouth without warning. ( I'm sorry! I swear I didn't know! ) I'm not listening. I promise I don't feel a thing. I'll try and think of something else: F is for Flint Rocks. U is for You, You, You, You. So many things that start with C- Creation. ( Oh, please, GOD. NO! ) I'd beg. Castration. that spot on the wall that spot on the wall At least your room isn't excruciatingly green-blue (69 69) At least your room isn't lined with  too  many trophies. That's all I ever used to be... all of this is making me feel like maybe I should help, 	       I should obey. oKay. oKay.  (I let you win...)

						   "I'll never doubt again." -Buttercup,  The Princess Bride  (^I think this is going to be the title of this poem. It is kind of...um...controversial is the word I think I want. Take it as you will, it is art and art is only how it is interpreted.) Written 3.1.04, Revised 4.4.04  I can't every be you I wouldn't fit into your shoes. (My feet are too small... Maybe all of me is too small...) But I have an idea.  Let's switch bodies for a while– Let's be inside each other in more ways than one.  You can play the stepfather I am so much afraid of In my own silly way and rape me.  Give me something new to give a rebirth to my wallowing in and maybe you can baptize new faith  while you're laying all tangled up in our own skin, fair and thin, and never doubt again.  Maybe I can make it easier– for a while anyway.  We're both safe under the sheets drowned out by these screams.  And you won't have to love me.  And I won't have to walk  anywhere in your shoes. I like it right here where we are, doubtful.

						    Darling Nicky  Written 3.28.04, Revised 4.5.04   The boys and girls are out tonight. They unbutton blouses. They unzip flies. They take off shoes. They turn off the light. The glimmering creatures are full of lies. They are eating each other. They are overfed. At night, alone, I marry the bed.    -Anne Sexton 	"The Ballad of a Lonely Masturbator"  Do you like having control, Nichole? Do you like to be able to choose how he smells? of coffee or smoke or grass or mint? Do you miss all you fell for when you fell in like? All that you secretly loved about him– the little things he changed to entertain you? Now I bet it just pains you to watch his trenchcoat drag along in the dirt. So Nichole, Did it hurt when it hit you that what you're kissing today has cured the delicious virus of yesterday?

						   Revised 4.5.04 (For Jake...you're welcome.)  A kitchen filled with a thousand roses– 	nothing to be jealous of 	nothing to be jealous of Save one for me, I'll do anything, please. Just make me feel special. Petals of attention, sprinkled with dew drops  of salt from your lips.  Nothing to be jealous of, Nothing to be jealous of.  Okay, you can keep the petals, JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING! I'll take the stem. The leaves, whatever. As long as it's from you.  Call me tomorrow when you get home from working– selling   a thousand roses. and remind me 	nothing to be jealous of 	nothing to be jealous of I though you were a safety net. Scratch me with the thorns. I thought you were a safety net. I could hang my halo on your horns.  Anyway, I'm no cherub. And there were no sparks flying. NOTHING to be jealous of, like I'd be jealous of a couple sparks...

						   Written on 3.1.04, I felt  like if I revised it even the slightest bit I would lose something, so this is the original version and the way it will stay. This is one of my all-time favorites, along with  Due Time pt. II . If I had to dedicate this poem to anyone, it would be to the bricks in the wall in that spot in my school that I love. . .  The drumline is pounding. POUNDING! and still somehow it's so serene. It's been an eternity without a drop of sunlight to baptize me.  But I'm fine now.  I'm okay. The psychobabble seems to sway the way I dressed and set my eyes.  I'm sitting where TJ kissed me.  Where he wrapped his arms around my middle and lifted me up by the hips and I wrapped my legs around his middle, and held tight. His goose down coat, I thought I was tangled in a cloud.  But I was tangled in a liar.  I remember feeling the warm metal of the ring through his lip, pressing ever so softly against mine. (We could have pierced our lips together and have been fine!)  But the beating had resided  and I'm sitting on the dusty floor,  the bricks holding me where he did.  Even though we both knew it wouldn't last somehow I'm satisfied with the little things like lip rings and clouds and bricks. Somehow I'm satisfied with the past.

But my pupils feel pierced by a little gauge. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick. Burst. Spin. Spin. Spin. Back to feeling fine. Towel dry. Try to hide. Everything. Shovel it all back inside. Chew. Swallow. Chew. Swallow. Eating pride. (So  this  is what my ego tastes like...)

						   Written 3.21.04, all the appropriate revising was done in the writing process. I have yet to title this poem, which I actually wrote when I had that retarded Nickelback song in my head. Yes this is word-for-word my own. Yes this is word-for-word for MIKE:  I love your collarbone. I love the way you fall asleep on the phone. I love the scratches on your arms. I hate all your little hidden charms.  I hate that damn Nickelback song. I love that you still think I'm wrong. I'd love to suck the salt from your wounds. I hate your Anime cartoons.  I love the way you're way too white. I love that you hold me so damn tight. I love the way that your lips curl. I love the way you make me HURL.  I hate the way you smell my hair. I love the way you never care. I love the neck I hate to bite.  I LOVE YOU PIST OFF WHEN WE FIGHT.   I love the way you have control. I hate how much of me you stole. I love the way you make me cringe. I love that love is just a binge.  I love the smell of your sweat. I hate the day that we met. I love the way I'm just your pet. I love all the rules that you set.  I hate the way you get me high. That sexy green ring in your eye. I hate the Godess that you praise. I love that I was just a phase.  I love the dullness of your teeth, the way you nibble underneath the thin blonde layer of my hair. I hate that nothing's ever fair.  I hate all the thoughts that you think. I love your promise not to drink while you sneak another sip. I hate the way you bite your lip.  I love that you refuse to cry. I love that you don't bother to try. I love that you're waiting for your wings. I love that there are no 'little things.'  I love the way you crack your neck. How you're just in this for the sex. How you walk so fucking fast. All the dark secrets in your past.  I love to watch you bruise and bleed. I hate the veins from which you feed. I love the ground that you walk on. I hate that you always sleep through dawn.  I love the grave you've dug for me. I love your limp, your fucked up knee. I love the pockets of your coat. that you're a castle, I'm your moat.  I love the fingers that you cross. I love the way that you're the boss. I hate the softy underneath. I love to forget to remember to breathe.  I love that "I'm sorry" doesn't count. I hate that I don't even amount to the Sapphires in her eyes. I love that you also leash up guys.  I hate how everything's the same. I love when you act so goddamned tame. I love the knowlege in your  head. I love the tears you make me shed.  I hate the way you let me in. I love the thickness of your skin. I love the way I clench the sheets every time that your cold heart beats.  I love that I'm still seduced by you. I hate the way I was one of two. I love when you jack off on the phone. I love your collarbone.

						    I'll Make it to Hell (The Beholder)  July 27, 2003 To Erin, though the original version is for Greg Jarry, after it had undergone revisions and I built structure (that's right, I used STRUCTURE) I altered it to tell a different kind of story...for Erin.  It's so cliche that I may cry, but what it crying versus death? What devil is this that tattoos his Hell With my every choking breath?  Another night I lie awake, My face is masked by dark. My eyelids are heavy, my fingers are numb, And my still body is stark.  I’m safe within these four walls, But Edgar Allan Poe once said: ‘That any beholder  Might fancy me dead.’  The beholder thinks she’s ugly, Unless the mirror lies. And on this 27th of July, This damned beholder dies.  But there’s one angel Who seeps through these walls. I’ve never thought of this one angel, As one whom cares at all.  I’ve always thought of this angel as The goofy kid in the back of the class that ive known since third grade. And though this isn’t a tale of his rescue, The sadness inside me began to fade.  And when I turned to pay respects to the boy who saved my life I had to look away. Any beholder aside from myself Would sneer with dismay.  But now I think I know the truth. This angel simply lied. As I offered again to pass on his good deed, I could see it in his eyes.  No tourniquet can stop this bleeding, Stop this hurt inside. Sometimes I hate the angel, too, But I know that at least he tried.  Maybe I’ll be an angel, When this bleeding its through. I might regret the choice I made, But what else was I to do?  So, my angel, I’m sorry for wasting your time. Maybe I’ll see you around. I’f im not up in heaven, I’ll make it to Hell  before the stars shine down.

						    Serenade    1.  I have 1.2.3.4.5. fingers on my hand. The bed is dripping off it's frame. My breath rolling over the surface of the phone like oil over water, all rainbow around the edges, slippery. That spectrum, seducing me. Myself is dried and peeling off of my fingers, like old, crumpled bark. Remember we had a tree? Remember it didn't like you? I like you-in 1.2.3.4.5. ways. You're the 'ow' in wow. You're the stains on my fingernails. I kinda sorta somehow... I kinda sorta somehow... I swear  to you, my God again, PLEASE. Prove that it's not me, and that it's just my 1.2. hands. I'll kiss you like an ant kisses the sun when a magnifying glass is held over it. I hold you over everything- My 1.2.3.4.5. ways, My 1.2.3.4.5. I turn them over to you. My 1.2. hands in yours. I give you my sweat. I give you my pores.   2.  As I turn on my heel to step into the shower, I catch a glimpse in the mirror of the little ink Star I drew on my ankle earlier with my hormone pen: you refill me. Only the Star, that's all I see, for,  what is my ankle? what is the tile?  My nothing bones see to be asking. Everything is just the background. Everything is turning brown. Left shining like a blacklight through the mud- that little Star, diggind it's 1.2.3.4.5. little thorns into my pores.   3.  I step into the shower and let the hot water crash over me, like the oil of my melted screams. Like you. I findmyself unable to stand, losing balance. LOSING CONTROL. Clawing at the shower curtain trying to steady my weakening knees. Urine around my feet (goldplating the Star) RELEASE  RELEASE  Knocking down the rack of razors , white blood cells seeping through my gold, tattooed pores.

						   Written 3.1.04, I just uncovered it in a pile of old papers and I liked it a lot. So here is is:  With a quick flick or my achy shaky wrist I can do anything– and I will. My magic wand, this ballpoint pen.  I can create whatever I want. I can create perfection. And I will.  A kittenlike girl with long dark hair and eyes that seem to hold me and lips that ask me to kiss them. And I will. Because I can do anything. And I will.

						    Someone Please Just Kiss me  Written 3.26.04, Revised 4.5.04  A simple hug used to soothe me. (I hate the world. I hate the world.)  Inertia– Around and around and around I'd go. (I found you. I found you.) I think I found a world I don't hate. It's getting late but it's still so early.  Do you appreciate me as much as I appreciate your mother sheltering my knocky-kneed smile, my kind story, and my confusion?  Are you as confused as I am?  You have nothing to fear, you are invincible, and I am so seduced.  I guess maybe all this abandonment is only in my head. (Everyone loves me. Everyone wants me.)  If you understand what I mean and mean what you say, someone, please  just miss me. Someone please just kiss me.

						    In fear for Sam's Dignity  Written 4.1.04, Revised 4.5.04  I fear ever walking into an empty arcade these days. Especially, I'm sorry Sam, I'm sorry Sam, if the punk in the powder blue polo shirt is anywhere near. I fear, for your well-preserved innocence. I fear for all the black makeup on your face. You are not the only victim, stay out of his way. It wasn't a dream. Run, I swear. It wasn't a dream! I bled it, I felt it when you'd scream. When you'd scream. I would have surely been ripped back into this dimension when you'd scream, curdling my blood. The world in which he lies in wait behind a Street Fighting game, I think that is. It's red, it's red like the blood he'll tear you open and bathe his- skin- in you're pooling scarlet mess. It doesn't matter how dark your clothes. You better run. I promise you this. Stay out of his way– more blood. more pain. more time thinking "IS MY SKULL SHATTERED YET?! I'M SCREAMING SO LOUD WHY WON'T ANYONE LISTEN?? IS ANYONE THERE?? SOMEONE PLEASE!!! COME  FUCKING SAVE ME!!! HELP ME, SOMEONE!!! anyone."

						   Written and Revised 4.11.04 This is breathtaking. This made Amy cry. She read the rough draft. She had tears streaming down her face. Maybe because it is about her and the child inside her, but it is still one of my absolute favorites. I read it back to myself and I was like...woah...  There’s an angel in her womb, I can feel his weakness when  I look at him. He’s buried under Layers of skin, sheets of  Membrane. His bones are so thin, his Eyes never open. He is  Nameless, he has that advantage. He has not yet been numbered,  Though he has been labeled, Has been judged. The doctors say He’s too big to be true. But I know that’s just his wings all Tucked inside that embryo. The Umbilical cord is so thick, So his thoughts can get out. But Somehow they’re all just clogged Up in there. The doctors want To get him out. Everyone wants To get him out. But he’ll freeze. Plaster him in tiny blue clothes, Put booties on his feet, but The world is too cold. The world Is too cold. He needs a Hero like a blanket. He needs A childhood somewhere outside To thicken his bones and whiten His feathers. His eyes will open, And all the sights will close his Mind. Somehow I know that he’s  Better off inside her. Somehow  We’re all better off not knowing  His name. All the years and Moments will take him over And he’ll find himself Under the mistletoe. His  Aged lips kissing the host Of his own angel. Wishing That she’ll get to keep Her wings.

						   Written and Revised 4.11.04  Does she think I’ll be the one To wrap a blanket around her? Does she think that I’m the One who can smooth the  Goosebumps on her skin? I’m Not there to play doctor or nurse. She wants a mother. She wants  Someone to grow up for her So she can stay young forever. Does she think I’ll give my imagination,  All my wit to her? Does she think I’ll Make her peanut butter and  jelly  Sandwiches and mix her chocolate milk At midnight when she can’t sleep? Does She think I’ll be her education? She’s Not much shorter than me. I can’t be All she can’t be.

						   Written and Revised 4.11.04 I thought it was about time I wrote something new for Jess. I actually really really like this peice. Everytime I read it over, my grammatical side says that it's really incomplete, but my writer side says that it's perfect that way. It adds to it. And anyway I still really like it a lot.  Every time I crack my knuckles, The sound rings you into my head. The poofy Easter dresses of All the egg-hunting six-year-olds Crinkle when they squat down To grab an egg from underneath a  Bush. It reminds me of the Sound of all those perfumes sprayed In the Greyhound coach. You came Home with me and I threw up Shrimp lo mein while you listened Through the wall. I’m never in the A forest anymore, it’s never serene. But the pencil in my sketchbook I remember you called that poem “Alone” when I was exploring only footsteps away. This little blister on the tip of my tongue rubs against the back of my teeth and I can see you  in my head, fixing the makeup job-I wasn’t good enough because God forbid, anyone was going to see you that night. You have other friends names Meagan  with 2 A’s and girls you always tried to hate because they dressed so differently, when really you shopped at the same stores. They giggled too much, you never ever Did. But when I giggle it’s fine. It’s fine Somehow. We used to believe in aliens. In 2012 will you still be breathing? Will you still ask for a nice ripe  Piece of fruit when you’re feeling Slightly dry. You’d always crave. You keep D.C. waiting, when really You’re just waiting for a chance to  Admit to yourself that you want to  Strip him of all the white he wears And his perfect blonde hair. I thought You were getting married! I thought he Was your snowflake! (You published That notion, then went running to  Your rock star mother and fed her The story of the year you were five. And she ate it all up and then burped It all out and you smiled.)

						   Written and Revised 4.11.04 When the subject of this peice comes across it, she'll know it's for her.  I still can’t figure out why she let me Read  through all her journals, read The scratches of her pen, forming Words of all the things she never had. Boys named Eric and Mike and Alex. Each one seems to be so stupid, yet They’re perfect targets to her aiming Love. She has all these feelings Swelled up in the bottom of her heart But they taste so sour, taste so chewed-up, Thick and sticky filth. No one will drink them Out of her. No one will let they’re tongues  So near. She showers over and over And she still doesn’t know why no one Wraps their arm tight enough around her. Why all the kisses are just on her stomach And her cheeks. She doesn’t know. She just wants someone to absorb her, But she’s drenched in perfume.  She’s just looking for her bull’s eye. But everyone is just so fucking square.

						   Written and thouroghly revised 4.11.04 This is for Egypt and I somehow know she'll understand.  Always scrawling sad words on notebook paper. She’s shouting “READ ME”, though the letters Fall clumsily off her tongue. So instead she  Swallows a pill, and listens to it slosh inside her. At lease it responds to this tan girl with tight curls  and the heaviest world In her hands.  She doesn’t understand that she is Turning, she is revolving around a universe of Lying suns and little cracking stars. Nothing is Real. All those feelings that she thinks she feels are Only the mercury spilling out of the center of the  Broken stars. Dripping, dripping, like acid rain It melts the thickness of her skin and she’s so unsafe. I know that all she’s longing for is a hero…someone To save her soul. And all the stitches sewn across her Heart aren’t anything but creation. Her art. She  Would give anything, anything to find a rescue, But she’s okay, she doesn’t need to be saved. Her  Tight curls are hanging loosely now, and her makeup’s  All smeared below her eyes. But I can see through them- A brain like a planet, but she just wants to have rings. She’s an angel who refuses to know she has wings.

						   This one has a nice strong start then dies because Steve came over and I lost it. (Actually I fixed the ending just now when I typed it, it's a bitty bit better) Oh yeah and if u mix kisser and killer is makes KILSER yeah! 4.16.04  And this is why people cheat. Because they can't walk away with what could have happened plastered all over the walls of their weak minds. If they'd kept it all up there then it would have been fine. And this is why people suffer. This is why people sometimes die inside because they can't live without indulgence. And I'm sorry I killed you. I'm sorry I tried to kiss you. I don't even know why you're reading these words. Everybody already  knows that life is nothing but a scrapbook of moments, each skull is nothing more than a bulletin board stuck with million trillion tacks. It would have pricked me to kiss you but I pulled out the pin and killed you I guess. I am everybody now because I finally know that life is nothing without screwing up for that one unscrewed-up second. Maybe less. And this is why people exist. To follow these screwed-up guts that make up the killers and the kissers that whe are.

						   I just wrote this. For Sam. It has yet to be titled but I will title this one. Anyway, it's 4.16.04 and you can guess what (should have) went down. I think...  I'm so confused because first it was me with my arm around someone and my eyes around another and it was Sam who sat with me on the cold ground while I wrote and wrote all the things I was thinking about the ferris wheel and the shadows and the way her lips fit nicely in her face. But I am lost in my own head, for I barely bothered to look up and watch her go by, spinning, spinning, like she does in my head. Sam was sitting right by me. Right there! I could reach out and touch her (I still don't know why I didn't.)  And anyway she just wanted to be kissed. For someone to heal the scratches on her back. And though I am usually the one  causing the marks I'd have kissed them better if it wasn't for the ferris wheel.

And she tells me she'll kiss my wings and steal my devil but while she's in the shower she thinks of someone else.

						   And you say "thank you" before hanging up. I mean it when I say I could hold you forever as long as  you wear your brown hair down. You have so many boys but I'll pretend they're not there and I'll kiss you  if only on the side of the face and I'll smile. I'll oil you when you stiffen up  in the prescence of a spider and I'll brush your wings if you ask me to. I'll place flowers in your hair so all the devils will smell you, so all the devils will envy you. All these things I will do for you if you just let me is. Become blind to those other boys and I'll say "thank you" before hanging up.

						   First she laughs out loud. "Everything is fine!" she exclaims, little flowers on her sea green maternity shirt. She just keeps laughing, like the world is so funny. Like the color of the walls were telling jokes. I slam another plate into the dishwasher, and she hands me the bottle of Ranch Dressing, and scolds me for not putting it away. And she laughs again, and turns to my father. She's got him wrapped aound her pregnant little finger, she thinks, and she cackles on. I wonder if the child inside her will develop these symptoms, these delusions of thinking that the world is stuck into her stomach like the needles she can't live without. The world is no bigger than the head of a pin. This is a funny thought, I know she is telling herself. I squirt dish soap and get some on the back of my hand and so it smells lemony-fresh for the rest of the night. I can't stop smelling my skin thought the scent disgusts me, and my father lies in my bed, rambling on about the moped he had when he was my age. I wonder if when I am his age I will find someone to impregnate with a laughing little angel, and be able to hear all the jokes from the walls.

						   Yes, this one is in Spanish. I had little use of a translator, because I actually am very good in Spanish. Anyway, if you understand it, you probably won't like it. So like it in Spanish, mysterious.  ¿Le llamaré en otra lengua, pero si, usted contestará? ¿usted siempre de todos modos?  Voluntad usted lleva a cabo mi mano mientras que pecado de yo y despluma las pocas plumas blancas pasadas de mis alas sucias sucias. (te amo.) amor de yo cómo se siente cuando usted los rasga de mí, cuando usted rasga fuera de todo el que importaba. Y le llamaré entre de mis labios asquerosos que se encrespan. Y usted contestará, Sé, o continuaré descomponiéndose.

You can keep writing me letters You can keep talking sweet, sweep me off my feet. But you're still only tripping me... again  and again and again. You are the car when we're driving down the highway in the falling rain with the sunroof wide open. And you are the shadows, like bridges over the air. You are the urge to dance in front of my dad (the music is so perfect.) Everything is always just so perfect. Even when I fall on my face. Even when you come find me and kill me.

Because every bomb wants to be embedded within the heart of a heartless bitch. And anyways, Joe and Anthony weren't explosives, they were nothing but morning glories, their vines wrapped around my heart. (Cat's Cradle with my veins.) I don't know who picked them, but they are still all tangled up inside me, and I'm hoping you can scorch them loose.

						   I just found this like minutes ago and finished it. Kind of ehhhh-y. (I just made that up! YAY!) Ok. Bye.  Sounds downstairs, the creak of the bathroom door. I imagine her broken water all over the floor. I imagine my aunt sleeping on the couch when we awake at noon. She was supposed to wake us for school. We should sit by the phone. We should sit by some lost patience. We are all just patients here. I imagine we can sit still. But none of this is real except these tears. No one knows how proud I'll be. If I can find a way to conquer these fears. I don't even know if I'll be afraid at all. I don't know how this will happen, I keep thinking as the darkness fades into another empty day. No patience. No doctors.

						   4.23.04 Ramblings-on about my newborn brother, Oliver. Written in the hospital room.  I have never been so protective of anything in my life. I will shower him in safety, he no longer has his wings to hide behind. What will be his armor?   His blanket? Coat and hat? Someday he will be someone's Prince Charming. Someone's knight in shining something great. Cradled now, carried by blood. He has a body now, carrying someone he will someday want to love.  He wrinkles up his forehead and squeezes his eyes shut tight when something changes, when he isn't sure that something's right.  He breathes so heavily. I can feel his itsy-bitsy stomach against mine. In and out. In and out he breathes, against mine. And everything's right. Everythhing's fine.

						    Corridors  I wrote this in the hospital while I was waiting to go back in and see my newborn baby brother. My father took me for a walk down into the lower levels of the hospital. Damn, was it something. 4.23.04  The mirrors follow us as we walk down thin thin white corridors. The voices from behind the walls plead. Out of the corner of my eye, the bloodiest face on a stretcher, all stretched out and demented. These walkways are narrow, they almost swallow me whole. I think I'm going nowhere. Everyone walks by with a limp and an accusing look in their eye. I try to watch the tiles (I'm not guilty. I'm so unbroken.) and there is no dirt anywhere. I scan a vending machine, as my tomach turns over, for any sign of relief. But a father-again in scrubs and gloves turns his head and my eyes creep back to the floor, all stuttery and blushing. I know inside the walls are x-ray machines and wires and tubes. Ever since I was little, I never much liked hospitals, they give me the chills. They'd stitch me all up and fill me with candy, so I would stay sweet, but it all starts to rot. And my age turns around and I pull the threads out. Taking something more that just string, my  sanity. (This isn't sanitary!) Narrow and winding I lose myself here. I don't know where I'm going  and I don't much care. As long as I make it out without patches or scars. I want to stay this nervous, rotten wreck that I am. This thin thin corridor of a girl that they've made me.

						    Ladylike  I wrote this on 4.25.04 in the middle of the night.  I'm just a thin girl with a handfull of thumbtacks, one wishful thinker can't destroy the world. These are the thoughts that curl up at the base of my brain as I step down the carpeted stairs in the night. I don't  know how to build a bomb. I could never get out of this burning building, I'd burn alive.  Alive.  Alive. (Am I still alive?) Women and children first- Women and children holding hands. It's not polite to put oneself first. These are the thoughts that cause the world to die.  Burned alive.

						   Not liking this one much, feels a little too empty....but maybe it's just me. 4.26.04  My mind has already decided that it will make some room for you. Like the peircings  in my ears, you can slip in in bewteen... A stud, but only on the outside. Your crystal. I still don't know how cold you feel when you're stuck through my ear, for my nerves  are frozen over, like icicles of wires.

The head wouldn't drop down. And so they slice her open.  My eyes are so dark sapphire today. Mike knows what all of that means, for him, at least. For him. But is it fear?

What's not to get? I'll stretch my light blue shirt around my shoulders a little more. And he vanishes into the kitchen. ~Gourmet What?~ It's like a movie, with the dishrag in one hand, and one of those grey pastic wash basins in the other. And the scene ends.

						   04.27.04  "If I keep holding my breath I'm going to disappear..."  -Thursday  The knife through his chest means nothing to anyone, except for those who have breathed against it. The glare from the sun on the flat silver reflects in the eyes, blinding everyone who tries to care about someone else. And the blindness turns to madness  (a knife through the core of the earth) until the whole world is crazy. The whole world is getting angry. Keep raging on and on until everything is dying. No one left breathing on anyone's chest.

						    Crime of Passion  04.27.04  I've expired. I've expired inside your lips. My rotting body I'm dragging  somehow back into behind your eyes.  You're resting your head on my lap. I'm resting on the ends of your nerves, like a bed of nails I'm sinking into...  Pull me back up by my strings. I'll be your little marionette. Pull my back up by my strings before I bleed you all out.

						   4.21.04 Just writing for the sake of writing.  Right now I love everything periwinkle. Right now I'm feeling carsick, so carsick. Right now I'm laughing at burp and fart jokes. Right now the sunset makes me strawberry blonde. Right now I'm willing all the water in my body to break so I know what she'll feel like tonight. Right now I can hear her voice inside my head telling me all that stuff about the love of needles. Right now I am held down- We are held down by Murphy's Law. Right now I put down my pen.

						   04.29.04 I was bored out of my mind in Biology last period. Here goes:  In Biology, supposed to be learning  about gene mutations and my mind wanders to the sewers, green water and filth mutants rise. Like snakes with four eyes and rats that can fly and the twisting together of species somehow. And the slime and their blue blood and black guts and visible genes. I see my teacher there, four arms, deranged, distorted features, golden brown scales, serpents for hair. Breathing fire, like the words, rambling on, burn my bored-to-death ears and I still don't want to even pretend to care.

						   5.01.04 I wrote this one on the bus to North Hampton two days ago, and began to type it in Pride Zone, but got distracted. So here it is.  Because safety pins trip me up like arrows aimed at my feet. Because fishnets trap me up like a mermaid under the ship. Because the bridge we are crossing as I write gives me a sudden sense of height. Because the crow suspended in midair- flapping its wings, beating the atmosphere- brings back the searing pain in my shoulderblades. Because there is a scratch on my arm and I don't know where it came from, I know I am unprotected. Because I have to save myself I have to stop writing this poem and just do it.

						   05.01.04 I wrote this in NoHo too...it was about a thousand degrees. That's all I have to say.  With envy I sit in the wet grass. With envy of two strangers (as envy usually speaks) rolling on the ground, melting into each other- it's so fucking hot out here. We will all burn.  But when the clouds roll overhead we will stiffen again and I wonder... (We're only wax!!) What shape will we take?  I close my eyes and feel myself liquify...

						   This poem is kind of incomplete...I'm not happy with it.  "I don't know who you are but I, I'm with you...I'm with you."  -Avril Lavigne  5.8.04   To Be Friends Again   For Danielle  I'm sitting in thhe skating rink. I'm sitting in the past. Someones arm around me, doesn't matter who. Never mattered who. Your song to Rose or Amber or one of your girlfriends, I tried to dedicate it to you but you refused. You always refused. Your first kiss from a girl. IT WAS ME. But I'm not colorful enough for your hand in anything. Just Megan, not Crimson or Burgundy. It all just wasn't me. and all the things you said all the things you said. WHO'S RUNNING THROUGH YOUR HEAD NOW? I was never good enough fo you. Crystal could hold you, no questions asked. Clear as a diamond (not quite as sharp). and anyway, I can see through you  both.

						   5.8.04 This one is really serious...I wrote it just for me strictly...but here it is...take it as you will.  I envy things like Stephanie C.* and the way she stretches her little lip out, grinding her teeth, when she's worried (as am I) about dying. Just because of having   the time of your life . It's her time,  and it's her life, afraid to live it and live it right. If the cancer's there, the cancer's there. (We're only going to die.) She reminds the world, fearstricken.  A little sex never did any harm until sex ed sets in. And the fear of the things you've done, because they're so very done -  and they are why you fear you fear you are too.

						   5.8.04  Remember when you asked me if I was one hundred percent sure? Stimulate your fucking soul, wear out your young bodies how old we try to grow so fast. I watch you sleep I watch you aging... I look at me and what has become of choice of impulse of being in love (I love you.)  Stimulate your fucking soul like this. Recycle everything you threw out when she left you to rot like compost; she dumped you. Now you shove all your waste into me. Little gnats all over my skin- your kisses...eating -away- at me. Catch a wisp of my hair between your teeth. Remember when you asked me if I was okay? Remember when you asked me

						    Bedroom Eyes II  6.4.04  When each little yellow capsule opens and swallows up a little red sip of her blood, he watches her sweet cells turn bitter, her sour lips turn blue. Her spectrum hands, soft black shirt slipping off golden shoulders. He watches as she walks though walls, as she turns water into wine.  But he hates it when she acts like she's drunk. She's so sensitive, like gold. Yet so polished and silver and brass. Fragile as glass, he tries to hold her back. Three different color knots and still she floats away. A pink balloon, a neon kite. (The sky is biting her) and his white white tongue is SCREAMING out her name but the letters are absorbed into the little yellow capsules and though he knows all of her weak spots he too easily abuses all of his  strength.

						   Mistress, you've done nothing wrong, unless you consider breathing a sin. Though the air you inhale is filthy and dry, You can blow it back out again.  And anyway last night I sat, huddled in the corner of my room, smoking one of Matt's cigarettes and writing a poem for you.  It was about feelings and the way I want to fall. It was about passion and the turquoise of your walls.  It was about the joint  that I'd wish you'd pass to me for once. It was about breaking through  the locks that have held me for months.  But I don't want to go back, I just want you to step up with me. I don't want that shit to bind you. I just wish I could set you free.....

						   Mistress, this is for you and no one else. The only thing in disguise has been my fear. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough to save you. Maybe I've been so deaf to hear.                                                                Or maybe you just don't scream for me anymore. Maybe you don't ask for my assistance. I think that the drugs are just locks and chains and you've grown too weak to resist it.  But I don't know what it is exactly, so I don't know what to say. If you still think I'm perfect, I still think you're wrong, but I'll stay here anyway.

      bloodstained16:	monday, you are being forced to endure at least one real hug from me, for i need to prove that your still there.  Alright, know what, I'm not done rambling for the night if I don't have to be...I made a decision when I started this journal that it would be for ME to  write it...somewhere to spilllll my guts all over the place and not have to clean them up. People read imy words, and that makes me happy. It does. Matt isn't the only one who cares...I know this now.  Bloodybiter487:	there is no way in hell i could ever live without you here Bloodybiter487:	i duno wat i wouldve done  if i had lost you Bloodybiter487:	a part of me would be gone SicTransitHero:	...really? Bloodybiter487:	yes really Bloodybiter487:	you amaze me every time i see you and  i mean it's not even becuz of any of your outside butbecuz i kno how you feel soemtimes and becuz  you accept me  adnd i can just be me around you without even worrying.  i could be the ugliest person in the world and you'd still care about me  Bloodybiter487:	and your so just wow Bloodybiter487:	you take up a good portion of my heart Bloodybiter487:	it kills me to see you in pain  I got off the phone with Mike because there were NO words being exchanged, and he wanted his pizza, and then he put on BD...and...I teared up. The BD thing is like a disease, I spread it, like the caffiene pills thing. But now everyone is addicted and chronically shaking and I want to take it all out of their systems but I can't...it's a part of them now. Not the same way as it is to me, but I caan't be selfish. I can choose to fight the pangs, but I can't demoolish them.  I'm still trying to decide how I feel about Indie...whether there was Fitz or not, I couldn't act on my feelings for Sam, I'd hurt Indie. I think that's maybe what sizzled my feelings for her, that she's always so sad about things, I never got to see her happy. But Sam is always happy, except when she's upset about Mike, and she talks a lot about how no one wants her and that she wants to die and all of those things, but it's not like she's the next NickBrown. She can still smile. And her voice...awe, ir's so happy and full of energy. Oh, here I go telling Sam I like her...when she kissed me in NoHo...I was so completely blown away, like, I thought I would never get that chance and I did and it was all on her part and...wow....what a feeling. Matt and I are talking about loss and gain and death and rebirth. I am trying to get Perfectly Die out of my head now...:(....I am lonely, now I want to wade in this somewhat geeky-kind-of-cute patheticness and listen to the Postal Service. Today I added another song to the list of the most all-time bestest most heartwrenching tear-jerking songs ever to me. MxPx's "Special Girlfriend"...for the first line.  "When I meet a special girl, she always lives somewhere else in the world..."  It's true, Justin, Brad, Jared, Will (?), Brett, Hacky, Christoph, Ant, and...well...Nick Brown I guess. I know not a single one there is female, but distance changes everything and I absolutely hate it. But I heard this quote on the radio the other night in some song, Mom said it was the Eagles but then she said nope, it wasn't and she couldn't think of who it was. But anyway, I haven't forgotten a word of it:  "You can spend all your time making love, or you can spend all your love making time..."   -apparently unknown  It's too true...like  Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades : "You don't recover from a night like this, a victim still lying in bed completely motionless.......(this is so m e s s e d up.) ......" That song was on the list the night I first listened to the lyrics. JC, they were like a blow to the stomach...I don't know. Whatever. Everyone have fun stealing that song from me too!! While you're at it take "Konstantine" and "What a Good Boy" and "Off the Hook" and "Konstantine" and "Crazy" and "Konstantine" and "Special Girlfriend" and "Push" and oh yeah, "Konstantine." I am naming one of my little girls that. Maybe Beau, like a middle name. But Beau Konstantine is whack. We'd call her Tinie. Beau should be short for like Beauregard, right? But what about BEAUtiful? Because she is.So her full name can be Beautiful Konstantine. Beau. and then Chrysdolyn Felicity or Chrysdolyn Konstantine or Chrysdolyn Drus/cilla...and then Jacob, we decided on, but if any others in the future, (FAR FAR FUTURE) they are Deff.  going to be Remington Pierce and possible Hike-Richael Allen, as originally planned. Those and Chrys. Felicity and Kidrey Danielle. Now that Dani Webster is a part of my life, maybe...her. I have a L O T of time to worry bout this.   you have a way to capture me the things you say bring meaning to what I dont know I look at u and wonder what millions of things run thru u r u in love? did u stop beleving in love? U take the world in your pocket and me in ur heart wen i see you I understand y sum ppl smile for no reason   -Maureen (N.H.)  Madre approaching. I better wrap this up ( YOU JUST HATE ME CUZ I'M BLACK. ) I need to medicate and then piss and then drink lots of caffinated cola to keep me up until 2 when Josh supposedly gets home and then explain to him all the events of the past hours. Then attempt to read, make another water-glue collage (explain this one later i will because it is exciting and these i cannot scan and sound like dr. suess i do.) and then pass out, all the while scolding myself for not being able to stay up. But I lived through some kind of tragedy I guess...so...I think maybe I deserve a little sleep tonight. I'll see Josh tm if they swing by and drop me off while house-hunting...(o ya my mom is moving, she told me b4 i left on my little morning escapade...i was bummed, but now i think maybe it will  be good to leave this area...after what happened and Steve being there and Braeburn St. and such. Dad, too. I need a lot of serious change.)  Thank God. Thank you, Matt, Sam, Indie, Maureen, Greg, Patt...everyone who has been there for me through this and in the past. Thank you sooo much. I feel like I'm on an award show ("If I only had a brain..." -sb) so go 'head, change the channel. This show is way way over.  I'm done. Turn me over.

      I just got home from Egypt's party, thank God I got an escape from my mind for a while. Julie was there, and this girl Stephanie who is really cute and yeah...we watched Scary Movie 3 and the George guy made me think WAY too much of Mike, and I missed him, and yeah....and a lot of the lines made me think of Patt because he was quoting them one day and he drew The Ring in my sketchbook at lunch and stuff and I still see it a lot so yeah...but anyway, we laughed a lot and invented the word PHILOSOPHIZE and ASSUMPTIONATION or something like that, I forget. But yeah, people in that movie got hit by cars a lot and every time I cringed all up inside...didn't know what to think...still don't. Yeah, I'll be fine...it just seems like of all the people I've told so far, Matt is the only one who has really truly cared, besides Steve the Mute, but I'm not sure if he cares really or is still trying to get in my pants. I can't stop thinking about everything, but I can't help it. I know I'm not the only one who wants to stop thinking altogether sometimes....right? I'm just so...I don't know. To many things for my own good, I guess. Mike says he will always be there for me...WHY ISN'T HE THERE FOR ME NOW!? I mean, I DO need him...he says I need Fitzy because I'm  his  girlfriend, but he's not here, he has no idea what even happened...and I just need someone to care for once. I didn't think that was asking too much, but now that I know it is, I'll shut up. All I ever seem to do when something happens, when I am upset, truly, or something like that, is ANNOY people, bother them. When I'm 100% spiffy, everyone wants to be there for me...is there something wrong with me? Honestly? Right now I'm trying to decide why I am typing all this into an online journal because it just makes me look like I'm begging for sympathy and I'm not, so this is dumb. I'm keeping everything bottled up from now on if I can, but I'm such a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of girl that I can't help it. I need someone. My Fitz? ...I really would honestly have preferred Mike to comfort me tonight, even if Fitzy was around...Mike can make me feel soooo much better about myself than anyone ever has been able to, I wish he could see that, I really do....It still hurts me all the time to see him, and then the other night when he asked what would I do if next time he saw me he just randomly kissed me, I really really wanted to say I would kiss him back...HARD. But I couldn't. It wouldn't have been right even if I didn't have a boyfriend. I miss being single, but when I am, I miss having people there for me without trying to get with me. I wish no one wanted to get with me and everyone was just a close friend. I'm going to call Mike now...I don't think anyone wants to continue to scroll down and read me ramble on and on about my stupid teen angst or whatever because there are more important things, like life itself. I learned that this morning, and know what...?  ....I don't think it was really to my cost. I learned from it. If not to look both ways before crossing the street, but to keep my fear to myself...everyone has there one issues, and know what? I  will  be fine....(sigh.)  Goodnight, sweet dreams.

      This is not an average entry, and it's so hard to type, so excuse any and all typos. I know my journal is so happy-go-lucky, so gleefull, random spillings of all that's swimming around like swan boats in the tunnels of love. But this is different. This is very different. Take this seriously...very very very seriously. There is no light at the end of the tunnel to go running to...it flickers out so fast, it's all gone so very very fast. Last night I was walking with Fitz to.....the new local dwelling........and I mentioned that I didn't believe in death...I am very solipsistic, so no, I didn't...I don't think. I mean, really think about it, when someone else dies, you experience grief and whatnot, you almost die inside, but to die yourself? To never smell, see, hear, feel anything ever again...and to be so unaware, yet not even so much as that. NOTHING. I couldn't lose it....God, I couldn't lose it..I can't even think about it without tearing up. But once it's gone, it's gone.  A taste of death is nothing unless it is a taste of your own...I mean it. There were crowds of people asking me if i was okay, tons of them, strangers, caring for me? (!!!) I mean, I just...left the scene...it wasn't mine. I didn't want it to be mine. they could all have it, go home and said to their families and friends............you'll never believe what I saw so up close this morning...then again.....yeah, it's all too believable. But for me, I really don't think it happened, it seems so very unreal. it was just so.....fast. Did they just feel bad?? They all stopped and got out of their cars, maybe 10 or 15 cars backed up on a side street, because of me, lying on the ground, bent, like in the Hoobastank video, I guess...but a lot more real. Then again, not...it.....oh God. oh God.  This can never happen to me. This will never happen to me. Did it??  In a way, I feel deprived. It wasn't much, no battle scars, not even a bruise where the pavement kissed me, no blood where the painted lines bit me. No proof that it even happened at all, just...flashbacks, and not even clear ones.    bloodstained16:	 of course they were caring for you.....just think about it megan.  how many of us would give our life to protect you?  im sure i can believe, but anyone who hasnt been in the situation can only understand up to a point.  i...i dont know...it just reminds of all of our mortality i guess.  just that no matter what happens, where we all end up or anything, i love you and you know you can rely on me.  I said last night that I believed in self-immortality, immortality of the mind, the soul I guess. Maybe even these temples that our bodies supposedly are. (Not a scratch, not a scratch) but...just...wow. We're...I don't even know what we are (or aren't). I haven't exactly explained the situation... Benjamin St...right lane, if you could call it a lane. The far one. Champagne colored car...old, cheerful kind of man...his wife, staying away...young man...20-30ish, his little ones, just...me, on the ground. I think. I don't know where I was, what happened exactly. I heard so very very very very loudly, as id there was no other sound but this, the thud of life against the hood, mirror, door of a plasticy, materialistic...........car. I felt like I was under the tire, if I wasn't so physically fine (I still don't know how this happened) then I would SWEAR I slipped beneath it. Maybe I did see the light, but it was gone so fast...I don't know what I was thinking. I really don't. All my thoughts were smudged out by the thud. . . . .    "Driving home to be with you the highway's divided, the city's in veiw. As usual, I'm almost on time. You're the last thing that's on my mind. Wish I could tell you the way that I feel, but tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel.   no commotion, no screaming brakes. most of it's over before i awake...  from the ceiling my coffee cup drips, while out my window the horizon does flips.  THE WORSE PART WAS HITTING THE GROUND NOT THE FEELING SO MUCH AS THE SOUND. can't help but wonder if all this is real,  cuz tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel.   Rubberneck traffic and passersby. Slow-motion waltzer,  the fir engine guy. Stand around with their mouths open wide...  heard some idiot ask if someone's inside. With the jaws of life they tried and they tried...  nobody here can know how I feel  cuz tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel.  (I guess it's over now, cuz I've never seen so much, never seen so much, never seen so much... I guess it's over now, cuz I've never seen so much, never seen so much, never seen so much... b l o o d...)   In all the confusion there's something serene. I'm just a posthumous part of the scene.  Now I'm floating above looking in as the radio blares and wheels spin. I can see my face slump with a grin and you. . . you're the last thing on my mind. you're the last thing on my mind. you're the last thing on my mind. you're the last thing on my mind."     -Barenaked Ladies

Unnyways, Katie is hurr with me and she it typin too....yippe....I am bored and all sweaty from Gymeven tho we only SWUNG. Right now I am going through a crisis of whether or not SWINGED is a word. And then I decided I don't really care!! This morning Vinny was dropping off Tasia as usual and I wansn't in the caf I was outside with Matt and Nicki and Tougie and I ran over to say Hi to Vin and Arcadio comes over like Let's go, Let's go..and pulling me away I'm like JC Arcadio WTF!? So I follow Matt and Nicki and Tougie across to the arena for some s t r a n g e reason and DJ and ...sarah... were there I guess as usual but I wouldn't know and oh yeah, WOULDN'T CARE FOR MY LIFE!! Anywhoo...I saw Maureen smizzoking and I was like bllaaaahh hun u can't keep on doin that :( and she was talking to um...this girl who did her hair like me though she did it before me thats the only way I know her. Yep. But they were talking about stuff and Maureen said she got to make out with Brenda and she was all excited about it and then I was like bllllaaaaah summore so when Brenda came trotting over I left and joined the rest a the gang...Matt, Nicki, Tougie, Deej, and ........sarah. They were talking about Pyro-day which apparently today is so I just sat and attempted to, yet again, sketch Matt. I'm telling you, that's what the fucking movie Mission: Impossible should have been about because know what, it is! And Nicki and I talked a bit, actually she kept cracking up for NO reason so I was laughing at her a lot too and there was just tons and tons o' laughin' goin' down. The end! Speakin of going down...I miss my Fitz so much, I really do. Katie is here and I am thinking about how some ppls call her Fitzy too because her middle name is Fitzgerald and anyway I don't see why she doesn't like her name, it's so pretty-Kathryn Fitzgerald Foley-so I think she will be Kathy from now on...(*Katie I betcha you're reading this with a GRR face on...mwah, i love ya!! haha) Okies, I am sooooo fucking female these days, so today I a little bit better pulled a Dani Webster but I wanna shave my head and go GQin at Eblens (Dad: "Do you suppose Eb and Len are gay?") and then I can be her...Speaking of... I was thinking about it, and I am a bit like Dani, I really really really really really am, though I bet ya all think I'm crazy for saying that (those of you who read  The Game ) but I am!! Not like you all probably see me, but I am!! And on  Cut ,I am not not not Callie. I am not! I am like...the Amanda/Manda. I am. Yep. Callie's got the amazing insight thing like I do, but she could pull off not talking to anyone...it is 12:24, but I think they're gonna hold the bell for a while. Okay, so I'm deff deff not Scratch...she's like the Angelina Jolie in  Girl, Interrupted ...Okay, let's talk about something important...last night I was on the phone with Fitzy, but I wasn't exactly. I'm getting a lot better at Astral Projection, and I love it, it is my escape, my cure. I can run away inside my head and run my hands through the waves of his hair and feel him crash all over me...I wrote that last night, you like? I'm thinking of writing a book a la  Francesca Lia Block ...or a Koertge like Brimstone Journals thing going on, all in poetry. That would be such a challenge for a writer like me though because I am like obssesed with details. I am thinking about what it would be like to be blind...to never be able to see colors or angles...or to be deaf, never get to hear your sweet whisper in your ear and all that romantic crap. That makes me think of Donkey which makes me think of Noble Steeds and Stallions which makes me think of the Faun I drew in MCAS and he's pretty gorgeous, but that makes me think of Arcadio trying to tell me he takes the form of a taur and he's like asking me the diff between a taur and a tyr and I'm like okay, so how you gonna tell me what I drew if you don't know? This makes me mad. I chain think. You know how some people like chainsmoke, well I chain think, REAL BAD. (adhd its not my fault I swear) but yeah urm that makes me think of this poem I wrote once about Batteries Included Jeff, aka Jeff Chewy...about that time he came and talked to me about ADHD and that I should start smoking pot because it will mellow me out and I was trying to picutre him as a young'n and it was soo cute cuz he's a cutie as it is, bein 20 and all. I am going to write a Love/Hate poem about Fitz, like I did with Mike, but I don't know if I have much to draw from because it's seeming like our whole relationship is one big dream, a cloud of pixiedust that I'm trying to peer through, it's all energy. Whoopsie, bell. More later. Love.

      I am on the phone with Fitzy. Mike just called me Hott Stuff and I bit my lip and it hurts :(. I was singing "Annihilation of the Generations" and it was hot. I drew a really good sketch just freehand off the top of my head of this girl and I am calling her Velle. She was pale and gorgeous and then I got shit on the picture and so I had to darken her hair and I freaked...ask Matt, I was on the phone with him at the time. I only have a second to type though as usual...it's 9:28 and I have a 9:30 curfew...I will say some significant things. In GSA, I almost cried. Ms. Horowitz is leaving!!! Oh my god!! Her mother is sick, and she's moving to NY and Northup is taking over but that's beside the point. It's really sad. She's the Rena. (RGH, look what you guys got me saying!) But yeah, Fitzy will "brb" and I can here Bryan in the background and he sounds like a dying brontasaurus and now come to think of it he looks like one too! I really really really don't like him. Icky icky. Anywhoo...I really love Fitz (*joshie*)...I really do. He makes me smile, he's the only one who, upon asking me to do something that will cheer me up, I actually do it instead of pretending to. I talked to Schizo Meg on the way home today for like literally an HOUR but I guess it was actually really cool. I have to go medicate now. Is anyone actually reading this? One time I was listening to 89.9 and this kid's on there like "is anyone actually listening to this? I'm on the radio talking to the airwaves and no one is listening...." it was weird because I was listening....I was like REBELLIOUSNESS YEAH! Okie so in GSA Jeff and Kyle-Kate like gave GOODBYE SPEECHES...it was really realyl really sad. I mean, really. And I, personally, had a convo with Jeff because he saw me sketching Maureen and was saying how I was really really good and it got into like should a person have to really choose between being an artist or a writer, or like having one be their specialty over the other. It was pointless, but one of those conversations that are just nice to have, ya know? Like the Schizo Meg convo...it was kinda nice to spill my guts..."...as I rip my self wide open on this stage while I am paid to spill my guts...o I would kill for the Atlantic, but I am paid to make girls  PANIC  while I sing..." -bn...I think I should wrap this up because Fitz wants to talk and I want to hear his SECKSY voice...and then I'm going to shower and medicate and read this dumb  Echo  book with this secksy guy who is an angel. It's neat-o. And her mother dearest lies on the kitchen table naked with crystals all over her taking in all the light and the rainbows and I want to be her so I told Matt that I am her from now on the end. Okies, I'm leaving...Don't miss me ...(EXCUSE ME.)-Dobbs.

      In the library, I don't really even want to finish my earlier entry really. I don't have much else to say though...ehh, the MCAS math part SUCKED but I got to miss 1/2 of E so it was all good. Nicki came and caught me on my way in late this morning to get the book from me to give to Matt because he was going to Ethan's or something and then coming back for all 3 lunches....come to think of it I should probably go find him now, but whatever. Anyway, yeah. So GSA is in 30 minutes when I'm done writing, though I'm not sure I even really want to go. If I remember correctly (because yes, I am medicated today) Matt won't be there....don't know about Nicki, but that's of less importance...doesn't sway my choice. But yeah, I guess I'll go to see Maureen and Tiff...Mostly Maureen...I liked GSA last week...it was....nice. I'm not looking forward to hearing *coughHER-DICTATORSHIPcough* (and by that I mean Dictatorshi T .)but I'll sketch a bit. I was supposed to sketch Kelly too, but I haven't been able to. In honesty, at first I really didn't even want to, but you know what? I think, I might as well...as long as she understands that it will be like the first picture I've ever like given away EVER so I'll need so much as to scan it first. And then Amanda Peliteer asked me to draw her somehting before she leaves to hang in her new place in FLA when she graduates. That's 2 by next Friday! Ehh, THEN I have to do the Cookie/Jackie sketch I want to do for them for a grad. gift because when ya get right down to it, Cook's my brother. He may be a complete idiot and he may have hit me for no reason every two seconds when I was little, but I got used to it and I love him...plus Jackie GQed him all up! She's wicked good in my book. Anywhoooo...My hallucinations are getting worse. It's not good. I mean, I used to be used to them, and then I got used to the meds as like a rat poison for them or something. They were totally gone and I guess that was fine. But now they are back, and they stick...they don't just come and go. The up-side is, D-N is back around. I think that's a good thing...I don't know what he's there for, but when he is there, it gets me thinking about stuff, it's like....excersize for my third eye or whatever you want to call it. I don't know. I'm rambling, I'm sorry.  Friday night I have no idea what's going to go down. (Heh, heh) but actually, yes I do. I really really do. I'm not going to the mall. All of you who are reading this and expect me, get it now. I will not be there for any reason whatsoever. And (I'm gonna get hit for this one I bet...) I'm not going skating. *FLINCH* Sorry, guys...no, I'm not though. I'm going to the new local dwelling with hopefully *Joshie* and maybe Matt will meet us there, if people don't pull the whole guilt thing on him or whatever...Mike does that, and I thought I gave in too easily. Ehh, Matt is so much there for everyone that I don't think he ever really knows what he truly truly wants, and if he does, there is someone else pulling him from it, making him think that he wants something else. Poor Matt, I guess...ehh, I love him anyway, he's my best friend in the whole wide world and I hope we can get together Friday because we don't chill enough. But if he has something else to do then that's what he's gonna do and I respect that. Matt needs freedom. He really really does. I hope Sam will tag along, too. I think it will be a P E R F E C T environment for her. For the 4 of us. Mr. DiVenuto is the man. He's all "whhoooo there's a typist right there....you know, at that rate, you can make a LOT of $$ in college. In my day, I could do like 75 wrds/min and we had typerwriters, not computers....phhhew I made a looot of $$." Yep. He's the man. Anywho, erm, where was...oh yes...Sam. Yeah, it would be a really great time, I know it. I've really reasoned out who should really madly deeply be there without bringing half the mall, because I mean, the point of it all if breakaway, I guess. Change, maybe? I don't know...maybe like just an escape? Something better? Closer contact within reason? I mean, it's a bunch of stuff I guess, but the point is that I just want OUT of the mall. Us 4 would be the best, if it works. Few things I plan work...so I don't have high hopes at all.... I have like, a ton on my mind right now, so I guess I'm just rambling on and hoping a lot of it spills. Like this: Last night Dad asked h y p o t h e t i c a l l y if we were to move to somewhere where I'd have to change schools would that totally and completely bother me and I didn't have to answer...my eyes did. And that's a good sign. I know I have my "looks" and people who know me well know by now what a lot of those looks are and what they mean. I have lost my ability to fully communicate with my eyes, I think. Or maybe no one just understands and can read them anymore. I don't know.  Why am I hitting the keys so hard all of a sudden ? Dad was also talking about cutting of all the cell phones except like Amy's or whatever for assorted reasons. It wouldn't be a total loss, I never exactly talk to anyone anymore or use the AIM on it or even the camera, so what would it matter? Yeah there would be less freedom I guess..but I can live with that. It is 12:25 and the bell rang as I was typing the time, so this is goodbye.

      "when you see me on the street don't believe my face, you can bet i'm a muthafuckin basketcase..." -BedDestroyers  Depression   Morning all...oh, god, don't make me get into the BD thing. Not now. Anyways...I don't even really feel like writing, I only created this journal so I could have something worthwhile to do in the library at school now seeing as I have given up hope on getting any work done on  urlLink my site  and I haven't been as good about my poetry lately as I have been...so yeah, here is my solution.   Time isn't the coolest thing in the world. It's really not. I mean, look at yesterday...SUCKED. (The entry is it's own little page at the moment, don't feel like copying and pasting it.) Okay yeah, but here's the deal...TIME. I hate it. I really do. I've always pretended to like, love it, but I really don't. I'm still recovering from yesterday, I can't stand another bad day if they expect to keep lowering the medication. I mean, seriously, though. Because I called Matt back last night as soon as I was off the phone with *joshie* to certify thay he'd be at the flagpole in the AM so I can give him that book so he can read it and get it back to me on Friday because yesterday wasn't successful on that subject. But NO. Amy has to wake me up with a "you- do -know-it's-7, right?" and I FLIP. Of course, my throat feels like someone hacked through it with a hacksaw (that  is  what one does with a hacksaw, right? I'll post-it that one...) Okay, I only have like 2.5 seconds to type because I have been sitting here waiting for MOM to get me and bring me to school late. NOT COOL. I don't see why Cookie can't get off his puny white ass and drive me, HE HAS TO GO ANYWAY, but whatever. *Joshie* called me this morning to wake me and I couldn't talk :( so yeah, sorry about that, Dad just called me in to talk about my Meds...about have u missed any doses? you don't wanna miss doses... okay GREAT THANKS! Gtg, mother's arrival. More at noon.

      Before I explain last night, here is my day...the important stuff anyway.  I HATE DRAMA. I like Sam. A lot. So much, that I was actually considering thinking about leaving Fitzy for her. That's pathetic, I know. And that patheticness has only been proven farther. This morning I asked her if she would ever consider being with me. She said maybe, she'd have to think on it...but probably. She tells this to Mike. She tells everything to Mike...her best friend. And so come the threats. He IMs me: "You're on my shyt list" and later "Stay the fuck away from Sam." They're together now. Congrats to them. Don't know what happened to Mike. Guess I've always known he's like this. But yeah...I don't care who reads this. I will tell the fucking world...because "keeping quiet is hard, cuz you cant keep a secret if it never was a secret at all." She can tell Mike things I don't want him to know, I will tell the world what she probably won't be happy about me showing.   I'm not doing this to be a bitch or to hurt her... I'm doing this so I don't have to relive this heartbreak.  TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	whats wrong? TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	you did the  face thingy TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	??hello??

TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	i dont want space right now love, i really dont need space, i need someone to always be like he is TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	i need to be controlled TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	otherwise im not a loyal mate TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	nor a loyal friend SicTransitHero:	so let him control YOU. not me. TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	dont let him control you SicTransitHero:	he shoudlnt be trying! TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	he cant ifyou dont let him TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	i dont know hun, i just dont know SicTransitHero:	i dont want to be threatened by him, i dont want him to push me away because of my feelings when you share them with me TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	do you want me to tell him that? SicTransitHero:	he should be more open and not stupid and realize that if hes with u nothing will happen between me and you anyway, and just let it go SicTransitHero:	why bother asking??? YOU TELL HIM EVERYTHING, REMEMBER!?!?! TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	omfg, megan...im just gonna go away SicTransitHero:	I'm so confused because first it was me  with my arm around someone and my eyes around another  and it was Sam who sat with me on the cold ground  while I wrote and wrote  all the things I was thinking  about the Ferris wheel and the shadows  and the way her lips fit nicely in her face.  But I am lost in my own head, for I barely bothered  to look up and watch her  go by, spinning, spinning, like she does in my head.  Sam was sitting right by me. Right there!  I could reach out and touch her  (I still don't know why I didn't.)  And anyway she just wanted to be kissed.  For someone to heal the scratches on her back.  And though I am usually the one  causing the marks  I'd have kissed them better  if it wasn't for the Ferris wheel.  TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	f i see you around....i see you around....do as you wish from here on out without me because i dont know what you want from me right now, im wicked confused....goodbye SicTransitHero:	by leaving you're only giving up. you are choosing to stay confused rather that understanding and fixing everything. i don't want anything from you now...not anymore..i just don't want to be threatened for liking you whether i act on it or not...i dont want to be made guilty for feeling. ever. you shouldn't either, sam. i don't know what else i can do, i only know that i don't like seeing you confused or hurt or anything because of what he does to you. when he leaves you and such, you are devastated...i know it, everyone knows it. he hurts you again and again and what makes it hurt so bad is that you can't stop loving him well know what? this is what you are doing to me by telling him things that aren't his business, by letting him control you so much that he's trying to control me. you know how bad it hurts. it's gotta hurt a lot worse to inflict that pain on others.  Auto response from TeArStAiNdSoUl6: TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	......just kill me....... TeArStAiNdSoUl6:	....it does....       This is my entire entry for tonight. For a while.  My reckless abandonment had led me back to paper... and I like it that way.  My feelings are mine.  Threaten me, but now your hatred has no backbone.  You asked for it.     Sic Transit Gloria Mundi.

      Library. Last night I didn't write because I was really really upset. I went to Dr. T yesterday and he's like talkin about going up and up and up with my meds. This morning I took a double dose and I'm feelin pretty damn fine if I do say so muhself. I'm sh-sh-shaking a whole lot. Last night I got some bed news.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY MOVED OUT OF HER SHOE AND MY MOM IS MOVING IN!  That's right. I am moving to Chicopee. That is so bad. Bad bad bad bad bad. I cried for hours last night. Everything today is reminding me of lines in Thursday songs, I don't know why. This morning I walked to the bus, got on the bus, made fun of the rap with Tougie...Got to school, let Nicci* like hang all over me, went into the small caf cuz the big caf was taken fer senior brunch, then as I was walking over to the table I passed Jake and he pulled me like over and on his lap and like flipped me all over the place and I thought I was going to die but it was nice. It was fun. Then I ran around trying to find B block's class cuz we weren't in the auditiorium and so I found em in 225 and we watched KATIE DO "LITTLE GIRLS" and it's sooooooo funny.  It's hot tho, I must admit. Thank GOD I don't think Katie ever reads this journal because I really like her so much. Matt said something the other night about "if anyone can turn katie bi its u megan"...I WISH IT WAS THE EASY!! I REALLY DO because yep, she's amazing! Urm...anyway...let's not talk about my little plans..he he okay sOoOoOo ya B was fun. Then we went to C, and it was alright, like usual, and Jake like wouldn't let go of my hand the whole period because he didn't want me to leave, as in leave Central or SPFLD or both. Anyway he put on my sweatpants and wore them thru C and while he walked me to D, it was cute. BUT WHAT IS WITH GUYS ALWAYS PUTTING ON MY SWEATPANTS!?!?!?! Seriously? Then in D Patt was there and he is hott and yep. Okay so we watched the class day thing on the telly and me and .........sarah............ sat and talked about the meanings of life and i had to try and convince her that i don't have BORDERLINE because she has it and is convinvced like everyone else does. So then I was just like ok whatever I don't really like you. And went back to my story which I wicked figured out.   E, we got in a fight with Ms Lee because she gave the whole class detention because the creepy purple hands hunchback sub lady we had yesterday told her that someone in our class stole the attendence lists. People are dumb. Then I came here and Egypt is here and Arcadio just showed up and zippety-do-dah we are getting KRRRRRRUNKED. That is a word Egypt found in some random persons journal that just popped up and she doesn't knwo what it means, so it is out word. Okay, I am going to go do something else on here because I cannot concentrate.  Ps. The Senior Prank is great this year!! I'll tell you about it later.

      I forgot my medicine this morning. It wasn't intentional. I did. But things like last period (F) are perfect examples of why I made this whole reckless abandonment decision. I was in gym, and alright, I was okay, so yeah, I'd actually play volleyball instead of avoiding the ball for the hell of it. Yesterday somehow it ended up being literally 20+ people on each side of the net. It was just like, who could slam the ball harder across the gym, then run for it and do it again. It wasn't volleyball. It most deff wasn't. I didn't give a shit yesterday. I just stood quiet and stepped to the side when the ball came flying viciously at my FACE. But today, okay it was like Marky-Mark-Jimmy-Jim-James-I-want-your-last-name-Sexton, Steph B. Steph C. that black girl and I. It was fun. Then people kept jumping in the middle of the game, but it was okay because I was actually playing, which I love to and usually do, but they all assumed that I was always what I was like yesterday. SoOoOoOoOoOo...then A M A N D A-im-a-barbie-girl-W E S C O T T jumps in and okay, let me first say hat I don't know what her problem with me has been from the beginning, but she has not liked me and given me all kinda of real subtle shit in the past. Yesterday real bad. But today thet fat-fuck-freshman who whips the ball at everyones faces not knowing his own strength (in ANY GAME HE PLAYS) im not kiddin either, jumps in and like whips it at me so i duck rite...it woulda been outta bounds. N everyone who just showed up n didnt see me hitting the ball more than anyone else before is like IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HIT THE FUCKING HIT THE BALL SIT DOWN! YOU DONT WANT TO FUCKING PLAY, SIT THE FUCK DOWN and I'm just like omg it was clearly out. n basically the same thing happens again tho it wasnt even a 3 feet within the spot where I was standing, but literally everyone like stops and turns and just looks at me, it was like a cartoon. So I flip. I mean, jesus christ, I flipped. So I just leave and go sit in the weight room with all the 300lb black girls and their Usher. Then they put on "Burn" and tears are pouring down my face, but they're too tough to talk to the crying little white girl (THANK GOD) so i was left alone. I went back in and changed, did a lap around thishalf of the 1st floor waiting for the bell, and then on the way here Jimmy-Jim-James comes up to me and is like hey r u ok? and im like no not really...he's like well ya kno i didnt mean to hurt ur feelings or anything im like ya i kno, its not that, its just, yesterday i didnt want to play because i was in fucking pain because i got hit by a car this weekend and hes just like OOOh. and im like yeah. and then i go on, well so i wanna be in a good mood and play today n everyone takes the game so fucking seriously and hes just like well sorry and walks away back to lunch. ehh, whatever. it's not like he's one of my close friends....he's not. ive started seeing him that way, but I really don't know why. He's cool, but like, I think he's scared of me or thinks im like a total freak or something. I don't really care. I don't. But yeah...they just HAD to play "Burn", right? Nocera called me Elfie in the hall a minute ago and I almost like forgot I was Elfie. That side of me has died. I think. I know that I am schizophrenic, but like, all these old sides of me are shining back through my big open pores and I cannot minimize them. Haha, that was so corny. Ahh, don't make me laugh. I lerned a new exercise, a meditation one. About putting a hole thru my fucking head. It works. It's hard to explain, so I won't. I don't really know what else to say right now...I've been thinking about taking this journal, because I write in it so much, to a character, and edit it a lot, ya know, but make it like a story. I have been meaning to piece together  The Diary of Ellen Chevelle ...but I don't know  why I haven't. Probably just the same reason why I have only ever finished two stories. I have a ton!  - Ronnie and Nadine  - Beautiful People  - The Diary of Ellen Chevelle  - Sanctuary  - In Vegas  - that Emily Lime story  - that Allen and Delia story  - Silent Keegan  - the execution story  - Tearstain Between part. II  etc.  I don't ever finish anything. I don't like not being able to finish things.I really don't. I am getting very bored with this journal. I am. I need to motivate myself back into writing in it constantly.  I am redoing my site (again) i know. But I am so pleased with this new layout. The last one was all experimental with pics and marquees and such, and I am now making it all work. And yes, I believe a lot of you will be pleased with the new color sheme. I am going to get polls back on it and a personal feedback button, I want my guestbook to fill up with things...comments, questions, suggestions, recommendations, ideas, jokes, stories, "shout outs" haha, or just type in it for the hell of it. My goal will be like 404 (worthwhile) entries/month. Think we can do it guys? I mean, there were 838 hits as of last night, so once it's bigger and better you never know. The bell is going to ring in 2 or 3 minutes, so I better wrap this up.   I have something to say about Fitzy and my relationship with him. Something is missing...I don't know what it is. The same exact thing happened with Matt and I. That was the bell. I have homeroom, but gotta publish. Over and out.

      I don't like this. I am in the library, though I am starting to believe it is useless to say that every single day in here. You get the point. Anyway, today was dayone of my Reckless Abandonment. Yes, I spoke. I didn't think I wouldn't...I knew I would, I had to. And there were times when I had to give in just to hear my own voice. This will come gradually to me, I know it will. I've known it. Lara is in the library. She is on the computer near the front where Keith usually is. Actually there are two computers there, but only one is ever taken.  NOW I KNOW WHY.  He is sitting next to me. I am not generally a mean or prejudiced person, I'm not. I just...it's uncomfortable. I'm trying my best here. Anywhere, where's Matt when I need him? Oh no, wait, he's talk to much and make me talk back. Last night I got 194 IMs when my away message was up introducing my silence, and saying that at 404,404 I will return. I still intend to reach that goal, so I will add the nights, the IMs and speak to no one. If you catch me at a good moment on a good day, I will talk to you on the phone. I am getting nausiated. I really am. I don't like sitting here next to this poor kid, I'm sorry. Oh well...as long as I don't puke. Actually, I wouldn't mind puking much. I was planning on fasting today, but in the caf this morning I couldn't stand it, so I ate like a pop tart, throwing a good lot of it at Pedro. So really I didn't each much. But then I had like 1/2 a pack of Skittles and a juice box. Just some glucose to keep me going.  I am hypo....hypoglu something. Hold on, I'll so myself some research here while I'm on the computer, and on the other thing Fitzy brought back into perspective so now I have faith in it again. I will just post the info I need into a blog, so I am going to save this entry so far as a draft, then change blogs, get info, publish, then come back if I have time. If not, tally ho. Cherish these words. There may not be many more.   Okay. It's called hypoglycemia. Mom said I have it and you can bet your bottom dollar it's true. I am eating in the library...HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, LITTLE MISS LIBRARIAN? O man, I am on the 2-minutes fast computer, so I have to go in like 3. Keith is humming. Before he had his hand down his pants and I'm sitting here like oh my god you are in a school library. Hehe, nevermind all of this giggling. I don'd get to hang out with Mike today, and I am so bummed. I have a BATgirl sticker from the doctor. Gtg, that was the bell. Adios. Over and out.

      I am sitting here at the father's and I am listening to Candy Kid's  Skool of Eurostyle  cd. It is soo good. I put all my bracelets back on, chilled with Oliver for a bit. HE IS GETTING SO BIG. Subs don't help my little sensitivity problem, but osiewell b/c ther are good wit good techno man! I am talking to Matt and Mike and Greg. Greg's getting me more CDS! YAY! He's so awesome. Mike and I didn't hang out today, cuz of Dr. Kearney's. And TM he doesn't think we should chill b.c i have rehearsal until 330 and he doesn't want to wait and he wants to hang out with Sam and I am really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really bummed. I really want to go hang out with him. I am so sad. I am getting sadder and sadder. And Fitzy has my little gold box. No one cares if I leave my journal for a while, right?   From here on in, I surrender. I am abandoning my voice tonight. Do not, I repeat...do not miss me. (Why would you?)   bloodstained16:  im assuming this has to do with your whole withdrawing thing or something.  every time i ever did that it only made my situation worse.  i tend to need ppl, contact with them and being able to express myself to them including through talking.  but hey, w/e works for you.  This  is  goodbye. Jaked.  Love and Sex, P.L.u.R.R. Tally ho, adios. I'm done...turn me over. Over and out.

      Well hello there fellow Americans. I am in the library and sick to my stomach and chewing this same piece of gum that I have been chewing since this morning but I can't stop chewing something all day or else my jaw will lock up because the dentist popped my jaw out of place and it hurts. Matt is sitting here with me YAY. He has the trenchcoat. I have missed that fucking thing. Urm, last night I made the rounds on the telly...Mike beeped in on my phone call with Matt and he was freaking out and not doing good so I hung up with Matt and went back to Mike and was there for him as best I could, until I started getting fucked up too. It was the storm. Something about that fucking storm. I started hallucinating really really badly last night, things were dancing, changing color, bleeding rainbow blood. I won't get into it, but it was weird. The energy in my room...Lust. It was fucking with me. Like I said, it is the most powerful. It truly is. I wouldn't dare fuck with it, but it fucked with me. I threw up all the energy that was in my because it wasn't good. Then Fitzy called and we talked about it and I don't know...it was bad. I passed out quick though. This morning I work up and my right hand was swollen, red, and it hurt. I took all of my candy and bracelets off. Things like that. We left for school, my stomach still mostly empty because I could barely eat with my fucking jaw like this. I shouldn't have eaten at all, esp. after puking because the I could meditate and be able to channel energy easier...I'm getting back into the Psychic Vampire groove that I used to be in. And I love it, because I have greater control over energies. Thie means I will have to start fasting again. If I use this to my advantage, I can rise out of this depression, I can fix things, change things. Be myself again. Have control, and actually use it.  In Gym today, I decided to silence myself...through voice, not through expression. I will type in my journal more than ever, and I will write, advertise myself, let the world see what I want them to see of me. Of my thoughts. Know what? I know it's not practicla to be completely silenced, then I would be a hypocrite and join Steve the Mute in his delightful muteness. WHoooY. Matt is mean and is keeping me from typing. Blahhhh...but yeah, I will keep to myself more and more as time goes on. I lost my necklace from Fitz this morning. I don't know what heppened...it wasn't around my neck when I reached for it, I FREAKED. I needed it's energy. I found it on my last period class, A, and I don't know how it got there because I had it last night and everything. Its energy has changed, it is emptier. I have to fix it. I like this power. I also like how I am getting annoyed with Matt not shutting up and by the way that was SARCASM if you didn't notice, but yep. I hope this is goodbye. Ahh and si, it is. Tally ho.

      Thank God I got to the computer. C Block after lunch, Ms. Barry, OUT OF NOWHERE is like "I AM SICK OF YOUR MOOD SWINGS! YOU'RE A GOOD STUDENT, BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOUR MOOD SWINGS ANYMORE! EVERYONE HAD PROBLEMS! YOU HAVE TO GET OVER IT AND MOVE ON!!" and I had said nor shown any sign of a "problem" or even any kind of anguish really, not much difference than I regularly am in there..I burst out in tears, I snapped. I weeped, sobbed, I couldn't breathe. For the rest of the period. And then she made all her little "doodle" jokes b/ me and Stephanie are always doodling well sorry we are two of the 8 kids in your class that are passing and you fucking take all your anger out on us!? I really really cried and cried, and Jake walked me to D, where I cried so so so so so so so much more. Patt cheered me up,  and I am really grateful that he did because I couldn't cry forever. I'm not that much of a Dani Webster. Anyway everyone over here is completely serious about this move. Most likely it's looking like we'll end up in Agawam, we drove by the high school and everything tonight, *tear*.   K0819KT:	your not moving K0819KT:	i dont care wat u say..u come live in my closet   After school I got a call from Fitzy and we talked about everything in my last entry and it was nice. He really is sooooooooooooo great. I just, I don't know. I have to sort out all of these feelings. I'll admit, I am crazy for Mike all over again, and remember the pain he put me through, I couldn't stand it again. I mean, I have gotten so much stronger so it wouldn't be so bad, but still. Why go through it if  I don't have to? That's Mike's like, ONE flaw I guess. The only one I've really seen at least. Um, but yeah. I just have to figure this all out. then I went to the D E N T I S T (ayye) not fun!! Only, I went in and they numbededed me up and it hurt cuz he put the novacaine in a badd spot. Dr. Lai, this new guy, is awesome. I've had like 8-10 fillings/refillings with Dr. Houle, and he never gave me enough novacaine and it suckededed. But last time, with this new guy, he kept on givin me it. He was like do u want more? do you want more? I'm like PFF YEAH I DO. And that one, which was a really bad one, deep,  and so like, I slept thru it. I felt nuthin. This one...I endured the pain. I just held so effing tight. Ya know how I explained the vibrations thing? NOT THE BEST PLACE. Though, I decided that I'm going to take this to my advantage...put a meaning to it all...so I listened...to that and   FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD !! Oh, Pat Benetar came on. The Pat Benetar thing lately. It's everywhurr.  Then I went to Ma's and GREG CAME OVA!*~* I gotsted me a CONE!!!!!!!!! Everyone, I would like you to meet CONEY JR. (LOVE OF MY LIFE) He is the bestestestestest ever. (Wo. that was hard to type.) I got like a bazillion Rave CDS and that is sOoOoOoOo awesome [instert getting buffness] YESH!  CANDY!   SicTransitHero:	MATT bloodstained16:	MEGAN SicTransitHero:	i am not going to central next yurr bloodstained16:	GRRRRR YOOOOU!!!!!! (im not really angry at you just very very upset and turning my misplaced emotion into anger) PLEASE DONT LEAVE ME!!!!!!  Urm...GUESS WHAT OMG!! THE PADRE HAS A NEW BUSINESS  HE IS GOING TO BE THE ICE CREAM MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HE IS GETTING A DING DONG CART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but guess what? Along with losing my school, i am losing my phone :(.   I think that thunder means I have 2 choices: 1)go buhbyes 2)death by computer  Bruises are showing up on me. On he back of my neck now too.  All over. Gotta hide, gotta hide from this world.  Hey Fitz, we made it through today...does this mean we're FREE? I'm going to go finish a collage I started called  Eternal . It's coming alone eloquently. Heh heh...gonna ring Matt, then Mike, then Fitz. I think that's it. Alrighty. Tally ho.

      I am at school in the library...B period lunch, but Katie is not with me as she usually is this lunch. She is mad at me because I told her I am probably not going to be at Central next year but I told her it's not really anything I can control and I don't want to leave! It hit me today that NEXT WEEK (thurs) IS MY BIRTHDAY. 16th, blech......Last GSA for the year is this Thursday, so there goes that which I was looking forward too. My day just keeps getting better and better. Last night Fitzy called and I told him I couldn't talk because Ma was still awake, which she was, so I really couldn't. I told him to go read my journal and I think maybe that was a dumb idea considering the things I've written in the last few entries. Urm, but yeah...he still did. Shit. Shit. Shit. Um, then Mike called and we talked until I think like 3:13 am but I apparently fell asleep and I woke up with the charger cord wrapped around my neck. Scary shit. Um, Tuesday I am "staying after" so me and Mike can hang out b/c we haven't seen each other in about 4 weeks. That sucks. But I woke up to Fitzy's call this morning and he told me about a buncha stuff in the past that has happened to him, situations and stuff and what came of them, and told me to think about it. I know he didn't mean it that way, but it seemed kind of threatening. I hung up with him, got dressed, collected things for escuela and then headed down for the morning bagel...onion. Yummmmmy in my tummy, that's fer sure. But today it tasted like C R A P. :( I was not planning on "remembering" my dose this morning, but I took it anyway. I wanted to just cry aeverything all out for a day and then be better, but I have enough to worry about because OH YEAH I AM IN SOOOOOO MUCH PAIN I CAN BARELY SIT, STAND, WALK, MOVE, etc. Really. I talked to Ms. Kelley 1st block in gym and she said that I could sit out, and that I probably have lots of internal bruising, which makes sense. She said its normal that when you get hit by a car you don't feel the effects for a few days. True, true. She said something I'll never forget to me this morning...It's rare I remember things like this...but she said "You are lucky. Not lucky,  blessed ." (And then a volleyball hit me hard in the side of my face, no lie, perfect timing." But yeah. I told Teej what happened, and Maureen was around. I told Tasia, I told Steph (B) and Michelle and Ms. Kelly obv. . .I told Kris and Josh in Math 3rd block...holy shit today is going by fast. Josh said that I am fucking stupid as hell for not going to the hospital, and he's all "START WALKING!!" and I'm like I AM NEVER WALKING ANYWHERE AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE OMG...[fear]...no...[TERROR]. Ooie, I haven't typed much yet and lunch will be over soon. Lessee....urm....I told Arcadio and he told me about some time when he was little and a car ran over his face or something, I don't know. Then I pulled out a folder of things to go through and my 5th gr. class pic was in thurr for sum reason and so everyone in G block like had to look at it (including Dowd) I'm like oh my god........blah. Now it's B and we have to do McBeth McBETH McBETH!! AND I HOPE OUR THEATER GETS FUCKING CCURSED FOR ETERNITY...as long as I am not here next year. I've been thinking about it, and I'm okay with switching schools...This kid is sitting on the comp. next to me and out of the corner of my eye I can see him looking over at me like every 5 seconds. Not sure if I mind or not. I saw Matt on the way down to B but he was with *Nicci so I didn't get a hug or to talk to him or nuffin. Argh. I am shaking real bad. I really hope both Katie and Fitzy stop being mad at me. I don't know what to do or say! I'm like having this really bad luck streak or something, I don't know, but it's not cool. Fitzy gave my my birthday present early when I was over yesterday and it is a necklace and it is absolutely gorgeous and I love it so much and it had THE best energy...I have barely let go of it all day. A picture of Josh in A with those weirdo sunglasses he had on keeps popping into my head. I made a collage last night, it was really gorgeous. The background was all strips of black and white pictures all shredded and pretty...that took about 2 hours. Then in the corner in like assorted (great word YEAH) pinks and reds is the word  YOURS ...There is that terrible vibrating again. I hate it. I am so sensitive to vibrations now...and NO I DO NOT MEAN THAT IN A DIRTY WAY. But every little vibration in anything I'm near, whether it's the motion or the sight or the sound, I see it...all. It's annoying, because I can't think straight when it won't go away...I think it's the printer or the copier, I don't know but it's here every day, just today it's louder. I heard it all thru MCAS last week too. That deff was not cool. I have to wrap this up, I hurt a lot anyway, but I have what, 7 minutes? I don't know, I am not used to 2nd lunch anymore because last week was all 3rds so I adjusted myself to the time period IN DIGITS. I really can't believe Fitzy has my blood. Matt read that and was like HE BETTER FUCKING APPRECIATE THAT!! HE BETTER KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!! And I'm like, from the looks of yesterday, I doubt it. (Should I, baby?)   Katie!! PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT ME!! I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU!! YOU ARE LIKE, WOW. You probably know this after the whole Patt escapade and the poem, but I have had the biggest crush on you from day one. I mean, like really. You are so amazing. You are the most gorgeous, beautiful person I have ever seen. I mean it. You are flawless. I can't bear to see you hurt like you are now with this thing with Paul, and I hate when u sing the Oscar Mayer Weiner song all thru B block every day forever and ever but it's all good...You should hear some of the things Patt and I used to talk about...There's the bell...  Over and out.

      "this is the first and last time he said. she fakes a smile and presses her hips into his..."  -Brand New I just got home from Fitzy...I know that this is like my 50th entry today, but oh well. I need this to help clear my head. I'm going to be completely honest and raw about this and no one get mad at me or anything, i dont know. But like, the last few days I have been thinking about this huge change that happened in my and Fitzy's relationship. I...honestly...I wanted to break up with him today. I did. (...sorry, baby...) but I don't know what ("would it be so bad, if u were to pretend that u were so happy?") changed my mind. I don't. I'm still not totally sure. I explained a couple of my cuts to him that I have never told anyone else about...("are you happy? i'll decide. these stories are so old, how they match your eyes...") He has my...stuff that I use for them...he has a bottle of my blood in his closet. I hope he knows what that is to me. My own blood means more to me than anything.  I WISH IT DIDNT HURT, HURT LIKE THIS TO SAY THESE THINGS TO YOU. I'LL SACRIFICE ONE MOMENT FOR ONE TRUTH IF WE GET THROUGH TOMORROW THEN WE'LL BE FREE...  ITS JUST ANOTHER DAY ONE MORE CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT. I'LL SACRIFICE FOREVER PLEASE JUST FOR TONIGHT. IF WE GET THROUGH TOMORROW, THEN WE'LL BE FREE...  THE WORST IS OVER  FOR NOW TAKE A BREATH  NOW LET IT OUT THE WORST IS OVER  FOR NOW TAKE A BREATH  NOW LET IT OUT THE WORST IS OVER  FOR NOW...  My thoughts all all just a blur. I got to meet Robin finally, she's wicked cool. She really is. A lot of the time I was with Fitz today I was thinking about Mike unwillingly. He wouldn't leave my head. That used to happen to me real bad whenever I went over Matt's house. Mike is like haunting me or something. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing  (fold the corners JUST FOR TONIGHT)  and I have a feeling he really doesn't often take the time to read things like my journal so I guess he'll never know that. But it's true. OMJesus I can't believe I spilled that, but yep. I don't like grey anymore. I don't. Not after tonight. Mike: if you were to randomly kiss me next time you saw me, I would kiss you back. I've really come to learn how fast things happen and I'm not going to miss anything because of anything else. I refuse to. (And this is why people cheat.) I don't know what to think. I've finally broken out of my disgusting slut shell but it's all coming back and I think there is only one way to stop it...I'm going to stop typing for a bit, but if I am going to write any more, I will add it to this entry.  Greg got me an orange cone. He called "sorry to bother you, but do you want a cone?" Yayness. Alrighty...

      Katie G just called me and I told her the news and she just like freaked out, and I told Greg a little bit ago and he was like oh man, I'm sry, r u k? all a that. *he gotted me a bday present!* he's such a sweetie. NEXT SAT. I AM PROBABLY GOING TO A RAVE AT THE PALLADIUM!!!!!!! YOU ARE JEALOUS!!!!!!!! I am so so so so excited. Yay. Maureen just left and I am waiting for Fitz and Robin to come get me....they'll be here in like approx. 8 min. I miss Fitzy. My side has been hurting really really bad but my left side and I fell on my right but I don't get it, I kinda rolled, so maybe like, maybe I pulled something, suggested Maureen. I don't know, but it kills. And dumb ex-pill-popper Megan is immune to ibuprofen and such becuz she used to pop on avrg. like 8 a day just to be numb. Ehh, I can bear it, it's just sucky.  Maureen has a new flame. His name is Jay and he is 20 and I am worried about her. I hope to God he's not another "fagit". I know he's too old, but i dont know, maybe he's okay for her. I know I can't protect her forever and she has to make her own mistakes, but I am her Angel. I can't let her get hurt. I can't. I love her too much. She calls Ma "Mom". Hehe. I owe her a fish...M.J.E.D.B. is the fishes name. One of those goldfish with the humongus eyes chillin on the sides of its face. Mjedb stands for MaryJane Eric Deroche Begley. Wow. I've never had a fish named after me before, so I'm pretty damn prouda that one. I just put on Finch because I want to hear "Project Mayhem"...another good song for all you song stealers to steal. I should probably wrap this up because Will Kulig just called me and OH MY GOD I hope we don't move to Chicopee becuz then I'll have to go to his school ew. Urm..know what? They found a house they really really like in Agawam...its supposedly great n I get a room bigger than one square foot, but yep. It's near W E S T*S P R I N G F I E L D yay. Okies. Fuck this...this music is happy and turning me on and I am leaving and I am going to show Fitz this picture book I drew yesterday called "My DAY" and its about my day yesterday, go figure. I typed it all out all about it but it was in the big long entry I wrote this morning and so it is lost.  I miss Fitzy. Okies leaving. Adios. Turn me over.

      "I  am thinking its a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss they're perfectly alignesd. I  have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay..." -The Postal Service  Maureen is here, she has been here for a while, and when she arrived she gave me a really really big tight warm long hug making sure that I was okay after yesterday and it made me feel really good because it's great to know someone I care about so much cares about me too. We put on Eminem and listened to "Squrr Dance" and "Superman" and made rull messy ice cream sundaes and it was yummy and then we planned to open our own ice cream shop and have lots of whipped cream and have whipped cream fight...ya know, the spray kind...it will be soo much fun!! We listened to MSI and like random crazy shit and she played "turning japanese" on the piano and I was exited and then we listened to 99 Red Balloons and all of that. And now she is lying on the couch behind me, probably looking at my ass for all I know and she looks really pretty in the sunlight slipping through the blinds. We're listening to The Postal Service (obv) and now she is playing gamecube...Hopefully I can go to Fitzy's later on tonight, Robin will pick me up, if I can get a ride homw, but like, I dont know...I feel bad, like I blew him off for Maureen or whatever but it's not my fault!! It's not!! I can't type long because I don't want to neglect her too. I feel like such a bad friend/girlfriend... "tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better than making you my bride and slowly growing old together...?" -TPS I really feel like I've been like a bad girlfriend or whatever. I feel like cutting off all my hair right now, but guys, I have found my reason to keep it and grow it out...I want it to grow super long so I can braid it and whip it around while I dance and at raves and things. Anywho...it dawned on me last night that I don't think I could marry Fitzy. Really. I mean, I'm not ready to be a fucking girlfriend, and deff not a mother (:-/ ayye) though I thought I would make a great wife I can't. I really cant. (Sorry, baby) I can't. I can't even be someone's girlfriend without fucking up. I rully can't. :( Now I feel like CRAP so I'm not going to write much more. She is still playing gamecube. She wrote me another poem and I scanned it and  yeah, I'll upload it later. She is so amazing...her words touch something in me I can't describe...it's like 10 minutes to 3 so I have to turn down the tunage. BRB (have you figured that one out yet??)  SicTransitHero:	i got hit by a car yesterday applejak010:	lol applejak010:	i mean applejak010:	that's terrible  jerk. ehh, wuteva. I am so sick of this TPS business. I am going to put on some random tunagegegegege...o.O nope I like this song. After this. I think the fam is home, but then again, I've been hearing things every two seconds so fer all I know I'm crazy. Like fo shizzle.  Video gamage off.  Maureen is sleeping on the floor. She is beautiful...:) I remember when we were at the mall one night and I was "sleeping" at the table in the food court and her and I think Mike Howell were sitting there and she was talking about "how often do you get to watch a pretty girl sleep" and I was like in complete awe because that was the first time that there was any sign whatsoever that she liked me and I've liked her so much for so long, so yeah. Umm hey, the fam is home...so I think like I might as well just sign off altogether. P.L.U.R.R. luv n sex. adios. turn me over.

      "Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to stay..."  I am listening to Candy Kid's  Blood Has Been Shed  disc and it is so good and it's really loud and Maureen is on her way over and I am excited but paranoid that she's randomly shown up and I can't hear hur. Ahh, she's not. I am loving this, attempting to rave, but I am all achey in my side from yesterday. Blechh. I have a gross taste in my mouth from thaat weirdo alien juice that I drank this morning. Ewwie, brb. (While I'm gone, try to pernounce BRB.) okies, I have choc. ice cream which I don't even like but oh wellllls. I talked to Fitz again and he asked me like what I thought of the journal he kept last week and stuff, and like, how do you answer questions like that?! Seriously, like, sometimes you don't think about stuff, you feel it, or just observe it instead of expeirence it and such. Or sometimes you can't even explain it. Like, you really really honestly truly don't know.  *~*To all thuh (pernounce that-a one) ravurrs in thuh nation*~* I don't have anything to say, so I will just ramble on and on randomly. There are little bunnies on my bracelet, bunnies are the bestist evur! Zippety-doo-dah. I think Fitz is mad at me. Our relationship is all screweded up like energy wise. Ehh, hopefully it'll revive itself. Hopefully. I really do love him. He is amazing. I am sweaty. After this I will put on TPS and maybe, urm, BD. But that will make me sad so maybe TPS n thats it...WHERE'S MAUREEN? ice cream ice cream ice cream ice cream...I wish I could tell what the voice in this techno is saying. I don't really care actually, the beat is great as is all good techno...obv. ~LUDA~ heh, urm, Next Sat. there is a rave and I want to go so I will get $25 and go with Greg . It's all ages so I don't have to wait until I'm 16. Ladeda, I will be 16 soon OH NO.!.!. I am scaredededed to drive, I am. So I will get my permit and then wait a year or 2 before I start driving. I have to keep stopping  typing to eat some ice cream. ~LUDA~ urm,my hair is dry now. This morning I washed my hair in the sink to straighten it and got CONDITIONER IN MY EYE and then Matt went and said CORNEAS n I'm like AAHHHHHHHHHHHH because it was really scary. What if I died fer real? Every one/thing is out to get me these days. Uurrbuddy (in the club gettin tipsay) WHAT WHAT!? Hardcore muthafucks hahahahaha. Whooee. I just deleted a whole buncha HHHHHHs so that you don't get upset even tho u probably are already because you are just so damn concerned with my well being. Oh my goodness, oh me oh my, where is MAUREEN? My wrist hurts now too. Know what?  Know what? kNoW wHaT? my cuts are mostly all healeded. I tried to tell myself I wouldn't do it anymore, for me, for Fitz...that's about it. But it's an addiction, ya know. Look at all the muthafucks ((haha)) that r like "im quitting smoking" like everyuutha day n then u see em outside sucking down cancer sticks like theyre....like theyre....like they're cancer sticks. I am going to put on   The Eminem Show  now. I know, you are jumping for joy even though you can't hear it and I can!! I WIN! ZIPPETY DOO DAH!!     MAUREEN IS HERE!!!!! Yay! Yay! Yay! Okies, adios. Turn me ova.

Hopefully Indie and Sam will come over. Maureen's got her away message up so I don't know. My mom said girlfriendS...heh heh...I love people that don't realize exactly what they're saying. Alright, well LEN is skipping and I am going to eat and I am blech now because I had to relive the accident again for Fitz...bblech. Okay, well here I go eating u out of house and home and then *painting. Turn me over.

See #2 10. See above. 11. Family 12. Aches and pains and trauma 13. That this Venga Boys song has a sound effect of like VRRROOOOOM. 14. This Venga Boys song. Actually, not. 15-34. Blogger 35. The tears all dried around my eyes that feels weird. 36. The VRRROOOOOOM thing 37. I suddenly crave The Rasmus. Hmm. 38. Onomatopoeias 39. "Come as You Are" 40. Blogger 41. This list.

      I hate Blogger now, I really do. Or this midget crap keyboard.  I really am crying over this one.   I typed a LONG significant entry and out of nowhere, IT'S GONE. I know my journaling on here is just for me to get it all out, but I'm a packrat with words and my hidden feelings too. This is not good. It was really really long.  Forget it. I am not typing it again. That would just defeat the purpose all together.  This is why I left Blogger the first time, last year in "Lost in the Shuffle." I surrender.  Turn me over.

      I hate missing days in here. Argh. Mall last night, cool...made friends with Kittie, that was neat. Eh, hung out with Mike and Sam and Matt and DJ and Indie and Steve I guess mostly all night. And Crystal. I am going to give Slipknot a chance. Um...mom got my a black light fer my room and it is sooooooooo fun cuz it lights up the entire litte 1ft x 1ft room and so much of my stuff glows in it. it is soooooo awesome, you have no idea. We ordered the party kit, and it's like a vamp thing so it'll be pretty swell. Last night i took caffiene pills and got really bad heart pains. I painted*. No one knows what that means  yet. My book of paintings* I hae decided I will not give to anyone. I wrote a poem about  Mike and Sam last night, soon I'll get a lot of these new poems into MAiM guys, don't worry.   On the 3rd, I broke up with Fitzy.  I am tired and way out of it so I am going to go.  plur megan vladimir star butterfly laroache creepy megan the lesbian mookie joe

      HEEEEY! HAPPPPYYY  BIIIIRRTTTHHDAAAAYYY MMMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! I am excited. I am a whopping 9 years old today! Haha I told Ms. Barry that and she was like, huh? She got mad confused, it was AWESOME. F-gym, walked the track reading, with Katie and Debra and OH YEAH and Marcelino. Katie   TACKLED   me in the locker room. Like a full on tackle. G-slept.  A-hahahah "instant messaged" wil...on paper, with the instant message boxes drawn and the screen names adn *ands and direct connections and like pop up ads and links and knock knocks and junk. it was funny. Btw, Irish is pregnant with Josh's baby. Good to know. B-acting, found out I didn't have to do MCBETH in the show on friday. Speaking of, last night was our play. Intense. I GOT  DRENCHED  in ketchup. It was soooooo gross. It was everywhere and it reeked and it didnt even look like decent blood. Hahahahahaha. Sucks for me, I know. Anyway, other than that last night wasn't that much fun except for doind personality quizzes with mom and craig about can u pick up love signals and "do you spark or leave no mark?" and I said, hey mom, I must cause a spark because REMEMBER MARK? I LEFT HIM. I mean, He dumped me, but in my head we were already waaay broken up. What a waste of so many kisses, Man.  OH YEAH, AND SPEAKING OF MARK AND B BLOCK,  MARK WAS THERE!!!  at Central, with Josh. I must admit, he looked really hot. But like, he was all "Hi Megan." I'm like SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. and he says happy birthday and then i say thank you all delightfully and walk away. Goin out to buses, he was thurr again wit josh (l) and like, I went over and gave him a hug and he did his little "hey" and then is like so now u give me a hug. and i let go and walked away. AJ is hot, he actually like talked to me today for the first time in so long. We used to be cool, now i guess its sorta kinda maybe gettin back to that which is coooooo cuz hes a coooo kid.  Mom gave me Anne Sexton's complete collection of poems today. I was sooo excited. She is GODDESS. Omg. and she gave me pop tarts, the good kind, and made me breakfast.  It is really hot out hurr in the office and every one probably wants to spend time with me because today is like acknowledge megan cus she is the best ever day. Obv.  Gena sang the best birthday song ever: G:Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. I don't know your name. Me: Vladimir. G: Huh? Me: Vladimir. G: Huh? Me: V-L-A-D-I-M-I-R G: Vlahhhuh? Me: (sigh) Joe. G: Happy birthday dear Joooeeeee....um. Happy Birthdayyyyyyyyyyyyyy.....

      Library, Tueday morning, but you already knew that. I was so surprised it was lunchtime. I have noticed that the days after I pull an all-nighter I am wide awake and energized the whole next day. One would think I would be exhausted and the day would go by slow, but I guess not. I think that's a good thing, because I can't wait for this day to be over with. Oh yikes (bikes!.....nvm) I just remembered I have to stay after for rehearsal till (5?)...Eh, I think it's six. Josh got me thinking. Josh Bobrowski, Banana Josh...he saw my thousand (technically 50) pieces of extremely bright and colorful candy and he was talking about Ephedrin. I htink that's how ta spell it and junk. But yesh, him and Dave started talking about it and though I know it's bad for me, the whole...experimental thing is not completely out of my system. I don't know what I am going to do. I go to the mall every week or whatever, I don't even know anymore, and try to pry myself away from the CVS that I love because I always want to get more of that stu   Reason for the above's random stopping point: The LIBRARIAN. Here, I'll play it out for you. [Type type type, Me. Librarian (L) comes and sits at the computer NEXT TO ME even though there was no one on any of the other computers on that entire side of the library. Me, (M) Type type type, trying to ignore her ewwwwyness. L leans over so obv.ly and annoyingly to see what I am doing...I try to keep typing.] L: What are you doing? M: Same thing I am in here doing every day, typing. L: What are you typing? M: Umm, a short story in the form of a journal.  [L reads the above journal entry thouroughly.]  L: Who are you working for?? M: [insert extrememly puzzled look here] Myself... L: You're not telling me the truth. M: I'm not? L: No, I know what Blogger is. M: Okay....do you want me to just get off the site? Because I will. L: This is a story? M: Mhm. L: Let me see the rest of it. M: Do you want me to just get off the computer altogether? Because I will, really. L: I want you to show me the story.  [She sits back down at her lovely little computer, don't ask me why after she asked to see something on mine...but anyway, I save it as a draft really quickly so I didn't lose it and clicked over to the page of all the posts' titles.]  M: It's all choppy, you can't see it all together. But here it is. L: [Staring at her screen still] You're not telling me the truth. M: Yes, I really am. What else do you want me to say? L: You're not telling me the truth. M: Yes, I am. I type entries like one or two times a day, depending on whether or not I can get to the city library after school because I have a hard home life. My writing is all I care about and here is really the only place I can concentrate and get things done. So I type the entries, then later when I can...which isn't often...I edit them to shape them around a character. Most of this isn't editted yet because, like I said, I have little access to this. L: You're not telling me the truth. I know what a blogger is. M: Okay, well I only use the blog space to store the little bit I get done so I can get it on any computer because I have no one place to save it to. L: You're not telling me the truth. M: I don't understand. I'm in here doing this everyday. I know that's what it is. L: [patheticly fake sigh] All you have to do is admit you are typing an email and I will leave you alone. M: Look...[cracks voice dramatically] I am not trying to be rude, but I'm really not. There's not email addresses or anything on the screen, you can come check. I'll get off the computer if you want...really... L: No, I know you're not rude, but...  I think after that I blocked her out because I have no clue what she said, nor do I care, as entertaining as this all is. I mean, what kind of librarian makes it against the library rules to check out books??? Isn't that what a library is for??? But anyway I stared at the screen saver scroll across the screen again and again and again and I will never go back in the library because of the screen saver.  Spfld. Central High School - Do Not Change System Settings!  Ick. So then I watched the letters dance and change colors as they went, I'm not kidding about this part either. And I watched the lights in the background that I could see reflected in the black of the comp. screen were turning in to things. This is pretty normal for me to see things like this, but know what? It was entertaining. I could feel her looking at me every 2 seconds, so I turned and caught her looking at me and she didn't look back. :-D. Intimidation. Easy in cases like this, where she thinks she has it over you, but just a look can turn the tables.  Enough of that. I went to the other periods, and it was cool in D because she handed out a new book and on the book card I got the # for the Mango Street book I lost so I could turn in the one I stole claiming to have the right number and save my fourteen dollars.  Nothing really super bad or super good happened today, I guess. I got a lot of recognition for all my candy, which I stayed up last night to make. This thing about Josh and the pills, I don't know. I'm still tearing apart the idea in my mind for some kind of no-matter-what-this-is-a-no-no reason. But I don't have one yet.  E period sucked. F period, ehh, volleyball. Whatever. Jose and Kat and Chi were thurr so it was cool.  I skipped afterschool rehearsal, as did everyone. What would we have accomplished without the entire cast? I'd still be there now...for the whole next hour or so. I came home and couldnt stomach a whole thing of Ramen, so I like, ick. Ow. Still feeling that one.   Yesterday was Paul's bday. Today is Joe's bday. Tomorrow is Josh and Jer's bday. THURSDAY IS MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAY?  I get to pick a friend or two to come to NoHo for all day Sat. My first thought was Fitz and Sam...but Fitz will be at realms and Sam...well, that would be nice just to hang out for a day. Esp. in NoHo. Me and Fitz, I'm kind of confused. Last I heard we are on a break, or talking about taking one, I don't even know where it ended...so I am saying that we are together for the time being until I can be sure. I am being optimistic about this thing as much as I can be.  I don't know what else to say, but I'm on a roll with this entry, it has been a while, I know, and NO I am not explaining my entire weekend. Not sure if I did or not. This afternoon Mom came by to drop stuff off and her and me and dad were talking and he was talking about me missing a dose and how i can't do that and tho i have (i.e. the PADRE thing.) But yeah..that convo wasn't the highlight of my afternoon. He said in the mornings and such or when I miss a dose I am "fit to kill"...yes, yes, yes, yes I am...though I am pretty good about not becoming a psycho killer. In C, Mike Gilligan was talking about how his dad's friend used to get picked on and beat up by all the black kids at his school so one day they were supposed to beat him up and this kid (his dad's friend) came to school on PCP and ripped off a locker door and beat the the kids nearly to death. He got a 30 day suspension and no one messed with him after that. I just think the locker door part is sexy. Dad wants me to go do a load of laundry, so I gotta make this quick...or I can save it, do that, come back and add. Ehh, whatever. I have been getting really bad back pains. Really bad. I just took off all of my candy and I feel weird. My play is tm night. Ew. That sucks. Ehh, whatever. No one really cares. Really, they don't. I don't even care.  I am all sweaty, so I am gonna jump in the shower when I'm done with the laundry.   This is to you as the Ramen was to my stomach.   Wait...ew, If that's true, sorry. I should have shut up days ago. Well I might as well just blow this popsicle stand now. I don't really like popsicles. I just realized how dirty all of this was. Haha. Shush.  Esp. you Marky-Mark-Jimbo kid.  Over and out...

      Hello. Earlier entry lost. Not in the mood, but how common is that these days? This is for Dove. I'm sorry. *Holds you*...it's alright...     To Chances at Life   You're dancing so graceful with my libido and grieving– your head held high, your warm chest heaving. Come sit with me on the roof roleplay under imaginary Stars. I couldn't catch your spirit in a hundred thousand jars. All I wanted was to suck the salt from your TeArStAiNd SoUl. All you really needed was to be controlled. Your wish has become a demon's command. The ounce of angel in him kisses your hand. Hand over your little TeArStAiNd SoUl and he'll protect you, he'll console. This tears me up inside like a sugar hurricane. Jesus Christ, what I'd give to make out with you in the rain. In a field of Venus Fly Traps and daisies, your sweet insanity radiates among all the crazies. I'll wear your halo around my ring finger and glow. Your smile melts the Krystil frost, let's watch the world overflow. Wrapped in Matt's white shirt, a fallen Dove. Such a perfect target  for my unworthy love. So unworldly, you traipse the mall. Like a stupid Star, I stumble and fall. (But only for you) I come unglued. Your adhesive heart, all the sticky things you do. You're like an illness, invading everyone's cells. Focusing in on your stillness, eyes filling fast like wells. Like drugs to the bloodstream, I've held on to you, but the only trip I get is a guilt trip from you. The razors that you cut with are still in your possession. Snug in your pocket despite your confession. These cuts on my stomach don't hurt so bad anymore. This pain is a million times worse than before. Like all 99 red balloons,  I have to let you go. So take your feathers, your razors, your tiny halo. I'll stay here and forever obsess. A broken heart is better than none, I guess.

      Sam...look, I really still like you...so damn much. I don't know what do act like around you...You just get me all screwed up inside. Blech. I am sitting here, it's just after midnight, and I am about to go to sleep because I am not even supposed to be on the computer but I am pist because I went to print a binder-size version of my book and the printer dies right on poem like 29 or something so now I have to wait or I have to print it off Dad's (When he's not around, of course) or I don't knwo what I am going to do. I'd have someone else do it for me or priint it upstairs if Mom wil let me tomorrow, but she doesnt even wan me turning on this damn computer tomorrow because it is dying so bad. No sound will work on it even. I am sick and tired of Jamie stealing all my fucking shit. I am. Patt is being all pissy at me and I dont know whay and I cant stand that. Someone, anyone, telling me to leave them alone for any reason makes me want to cry so very badly...that's what I am going to run off and do. I have bad cramps, and not only that, but I want to vomit so badly. I'm not in good shape here, guys. I hope Ma just let's me sleep tomorrow because I need it. Bad.  -Bang'

      I love Atmosphere. So much. Once again, I don't really feel like typing, but I'll leave this window minimized and keep coming back to it...this morning I was wicked like, blech. Well, I might as well say this afternoon. I didn't get up until after 12. No, I am not about to start up about my dreams. Way too weird, and way too many of them. Wo. Seriously, folks. But yeah, this morning I was about to smoke one of Matt's cigarettes. I didn't because not only is that disgustingly gross, but I know myself, I 'd become instantly addicted and because I like being able to mean it when I say I've never smoked anything in my life at all...ever. (And I dont ever plan on it!)  Tithe has hit a dull spot. I need to get through this book, need some more focus. It really is that great, it is!  GOD LOVES UGLY!  Yesterday I had the WORLDS WORST cramps. Omg, I have never had cramps that bad before, it was WEIRD. It sucks.  Last night I must have dont something severly wrong because 1. Sam wasn't wearing the bracelet...i guess i didn't really expect her to, but still. 2. she wouldnt even let me  say goodbye.  i like her so much, but i always seem to screw something up. I cant type great, my computer is being slow my apologies.  i think i'm just gonna let you go. i guess. god loves ugly.

      I don't really wanna explain this all. Mike, this is all screwed up. Be with Krystil. I mean, I wasn't expecting you to be with me or anything...but God. And now Dove is all...I don't even know. Got 2 Atmosphere CDs. In love. I don't know what else I sould really say, NO MATT. No. I got matt's cigs so he can't smoke them. I will probably throw them out. They are bad. I showed off my *paintings tonight.  No one knows where they came from...not the surface of my skin, not my veins.... that *paint was out of my fucking SOUL. My heart...(no wonder it hurts so bad lately...LITERALLY...im not even kidding.) Tithe is so good, Oliver's doing alright.  Oochie wally wally. I'm gonna just leave it at that. I want to VoMiT.   -BangBang

      Sadness is disgusting. Misery is an ugly, wretched, twisted, sick beast. Pain is so gross. It is NOT EXQUISITE. It is NOT BEAUTIFUL.  Today, *cSHEc* said something like "Death is a beautiful thing, embrace it." While these girls were huddled under an umbrella in the rain, one of them was on a cell phone. They were haveing a moment of silence because someone died. And *cSc* was MOCKING them by doing what she always does...she was trying to be noticed as so dark. It's not her and she can't see that because she has not felt real pain, no real suffering. Wait until someone she loves to death dies... Then let her see how BEAUTIFUL it is, when her loved one is rotting six feet underground with maggots crawling through their eyes and ears and out their nose. While the worms lay eggs in their belly button and people through their McDonald's bags and cigarette butts on the ground above them, making the soil so filthy that nothing could ever grow their again to be lessed with even a blade of grass or a dandelion. When she wanted to go see them and give her best wishes the tears will burn her eyes out and make her a thousand times more wretched than she is, and she'll have to squat down on a patch of nothing but dirt to look at her reflection in the tombstone-her reflection...the ugly rotten dirty "beautiful" death she wants to be so badly...which, by the way, is covered in grafitti.   I hope she has nightmares about an angel that will come and kiss her on the mouth and then vomit on her, sickened by all the death-germs on her lips. And that angel will twist and gnarl its limbs all up and she will become a gross, knotted wreck that will strangle her with happiness and she will scream because she thinks it's music when she sings...and then the angel-beast will remind her how when she wanted a nickname so bad I said I'd call her "Misery" and from then on she chopped off al her hair and her face broke out in a thousand death-blemishes (which scarred like bite marks from a cherub) and she started wearing beaded jewelry along with her ankhs...the essences of which choke her while they swing from her thickening neck because they mean LIFE LIFE LIFE. and all she thinks she wants to do is be beautiful. she was, until she decided to maim herself into horridness and then scream at the living for not loving it.   The only way now, that she can be beautiful, is deep underground, with all the maggots and worms wriggling through her stinking rotting flesh and she'll try to smile with her disgusting fossil jaw while the living, the truly gorgeous, drive by. She thinks they adore her, when really they just bless her with their cigarette butts and trash and gag at the sight of her stupid patch of dirt because that is what she wanted. Death.   How exquisite is that?

      Today has been a day full of omens, good and bad, I think, though I am not sure.  This morning I went with Mom to see the new house... -The little old lady in the shoe thing in the kitchen -Mom's shirt -The windshield wipers -"Poison Ivy" ...I have something and mom thinks it's poison ivy and it's weird and I bet it's just an allergic reaction but I don't know.  We drove back to her house, I got cream stuff, ate... -Mom got a call from Matt....something happened. There was a fire in the kitchen...in the panic, someone dropped the baby and he stopped breathing...they took him to the emergency room, Matt had to go to Fitchburg, Dad was all shooken up, Jackie stayed with Nic at the house. That's all I knew. I cried.  School...showed up for C block, Spanish. Nothing that happened then was significant enough for me to explain. D-realized I didn't have my story stuff on me, couldn't read in that class, so I just sat there. E-tested...but that class never changes. F-sat and read and fell so deeply into Tithe...oh my God. Why did I think Sweetblood could be my favorite book. Wow. Went out to the bus, it was so very very late.  Forget the rest of the omens I guess.... Dad came home with Deb and he told us in detail what happened, I will not explain it here...we all bawled so much, my head hurts so very very bad and my hands itch...My stomach hurts of hunger somehow, eben though I have been eating like a PIG, but oh well. Cramps, PMS, the works. You know how it is. I don't have much time, this typing is like, bleccch...I can't focus, see...I have to keep hitting the backspace key. Over and over. I'm gonna wrap this up. I'll be at the hospital all night with Oliver...so you can try to call me, but I can't use the cell phone inside the hospital, so depending on where I am I may or may not get to talk to you...depending on whether or not I am home before 9:30, I may or may not get back to you, to like, explain last night and tonight and everything. Well, whatever. Scratch that (heh heh) because I doubt I'll be home in time anyway. Really do. I'll be alright guys...it's just really scary when someone you love gets hurt, ya know? There are things in his brain or something they are watching and he will be there over night. Well, I cant bear this stupid journal any more.  And I'm off....

      I just absolutely had to get back to you. Journal time, much needed. I just found one really old mix cd and I am listening to "Take On Me" and I just realized that I really always have loved this song, it's up there with Konstantine, ya know. Take on me.....Take on me....Take me onnnnn, (Take on me) I'll be gonnnnnnnne. do do do dooooooooooo. I really am feeling so insightful or whatevfer, I won't share, and just for that Matt will comment saying that I should say because he actually cares. Mhm. Sure, Matt. You may actually be the only one. I dont even care. Amy just said we have 10 minutes before take off, so I thought I'd get back to you. Um, I just went out in the garage to close the big door, and there was a box cutter on the table and my breath got all stuck in my throat. I am listening to Default now. I miss this stuff so much. Not all of it, mind you, but whatever. I am so tired. I think I'll fall asleep in the car, but I want to read, so I hate that...falling alseep reading. Unless I'm trying to, ya know. Anyway, I'm gonna go now to go wash up and cool down and change and pack (?) and eat and all of the bare (hehe) necesseties of life. Plus someone just IMed me.  Okay, you can have summore love id you want, -Vlad-

      Darn is a funny word, darn it. I am all hot and sweaty (but you already knew that)...seeing as you are too. Tougie CARRIED me home from the bus today. Well, not all the way, but when I asked him to I wasn't serious. It was cool. Tougie's a good kid. I am so tired, but I will not complain. I finished The Sisterhood book today, and yeah, it's good, I will admit. I am going to read Tithe now I think, I don't really want to, but this is one damn book I am judging by it's absolutely breathtaking cover. I hope I get to the library on Sat. just to filter out the books I've already read, cuz I have way too many in line for once. I am sleeping with Hilary's mom. Haha. Nevermind. I gotta go to Alyssa's bday thingy tonight in CT, which is good because I will get lots of reading time, and that's what I am really looking forward to. Plus, get ready to laugh aloud...I just said aloud. No but seriously...think about the date. Screw the 200 part. June 9...June is the 6th month. (You: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH HAHAHAHAHAAH HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA AHHAAHAHAHA Megan you are TOO MUCH!!! *Doubling over in laughter* HAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA *gasping for air* hahahahahahahah ahahahah!!! hahah!!!! Hey wait *suddenly catching your breath*...that is so hot, [like you, Megan, of course] and it turns me on [like you, Megan, DUH] and so I am going to go find someone hot [like you, Megan...if anyone compares....hmm...screw it, where the hell are ya?!?!?!?] and have one. Adios.) Me: You wish.  You: Nuh uh, you wish. Me: Neh, that'k okay babe. I'd fall asleep. You: Nuh uh, you wi--wait, what? Me: *collapses*   El scenario neato. Actually so realistic-o. Erm, ok, that reminds me, I had a kind of out-thurr day. 1st block, B-laid on the stage with katie (:-D) and josh and pretrended to do homework...omg i hope i dont forget to actually do this one because I will miss the class time to do it tm!! oh no!! oh well. C-SUNG...no...ACTED OUT AND SUNG "HEAD, SHOULDERS, KNEES, and TOES"...well, in Spanish. Therefore it is: "Cabeza, Hombros, Piernas, Pies." It's sad I know that, is it? *Punches you in the fucking face*...jerk. Mike Gilligan like...oh never mind, you had to be there. D-slept. Wrote...*cough HER cough* a note about hoe she tries WAY too hard to be profound in her poetry and if every other words is 9-11 letters long, who the hell will get the meaning of the poem? It's not poetry if there can be no personal interpretation for the reader, unless it is  completely for the poet and no one else. But she flaunts it, therefore, it just dies. E-I was offered 2nd lunch as well as 3rd because of the big BDAY last week, but I loathe lunch, so I got on the computer instead, expecting I would be able to come on here and write and make up for all the lost time or whatever. But Blogger was down and I was PIST.  Lunch-I am sleeping with Hilary's mom, lol. Long story. I went outside to all the smoker's new spot or whatever, I dont know, I dont keep tabs on dumb things like that. But anyway, everyone was there and it was cool and Maureen was there and I tried not to think about her because she has a boyfriend (Some Tom, I dont know...) and also Brenda was there, and her presence makes me feel like I'm not supposed to like Maureen. I don't actually really know why.   I have to go really soon to leave for CT.  o yeah, so F, I just sat and read, no one was doing anything. Stupid lock thing again. G-read, STAYED AWAKE...I know, I never cease to amaze myself. Got to last page of the Sisterhood, the bell rang.  Broke a bracelet, sucked, funny, hahah.  Went home, the end.  Now I am sitting here, covered in sweat and jewels...I feel like Claire...does this mean I will die? (This is weird.) I am going to get going though, I will get back to you, my lovelies, if I am home and concious before 9:30...doubt it, but theres always the chance. I doubt Mike reads this, but if ya do, Call me...  This is me turning it all off like the radio. Nevermind.  Cuz I guess you'll probably see me again... whether you get it or not, you no one you.  Find me. Static or wherever. Love and Sex, minus the sex... -vlad today-

      I have so much to say but I have approx. 7 minutes before computer curfew, at which time I have to call greg back and then see if Mike called. I really do have a lot to say. I went to Cookie's graduation just now, then Wendy's which i hate, but o well, and Creepy Kid graduated and I was proud yay, I told him haha ur still creepy but congrats man. N Melissa too...that was cool, she's so pretty. I didn't get to talk to her, or even make eye contact for that matter, but that's okay. Her energy stuck with me (and I don't even have my crystal on me!)...I am wearing NICE clothing, which I may or may not puruse at one point or another. I have this flowery pink thing on with the neck that goes all the way down so your boobs fall out and all the decent people wear like a white camisole under it. I considered not, my boobs havent fallen out of any kind of shirt in a while, but I guess I have some kind of ounce of like self respect or something...I know. A second ago I was freezing, now I'm sweating like gross so I might as well go. like 2 minutes left (I wasted most of my time typing the approx.) ...I really do have a lot to say. I started a paper journal, heh heh...but yep. I guess I need it with this hectic life ive been living somehow. Gonna go medicate and ringaling the peeps. (shoot me). I really gotta go now though. I promise, I will get back to this sometime this week and type a full-fledged entry about everything annd nothing all at once, like old times. Until then...  ciao.

      This whole, not going to the library thing is really screwing me all up. With like this journal and such, and getting back into the swing of lunches. Plus today Eric (N) like plastered me with mustard. First ketchup, now mustard....i dont even wanna know whats next. Today I worked with dad on the ice cream truck and that is some crazy shit. We saw jess, that was cool. I have a paper that was due this morning, that I haven't even looked at really, and I got out of being in that period because of a dr. appt...that's cool...(she wants to put me on sleep pills now too....*rolls eyes*) Yesterday we went to Osgood's and I talked mom into buying little bits of 12 diff. fabrics to make this skirt out of, right, even though it's made with 12 pieces youre supposed to only do it in like one color or whatever but it doesnt matter, so me and kayla picked out a buncha crazy peices and miraculously they all fit really well and all like scream MEGAN ot VLAD or ELFiE or STAR or whatever you call me. But they do. It's about 1/2 made, and let me tell you Missy, it is a TON of work, but o man it will be worth it...i mean look at the pieces: -Fairies on black -lime green with like spiders and spiderwebs -Polka dots of like all diff. colors on white -a comic strip one and in one of the boxes its like "WHAT ABOUT ME JEFF?" and he's like "WELL...YOUR COOKING STINKS!!" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. -one with a bunch of cats and cat faces -kinds tye-dye-ish darkish green and forest green -deep magenta with black vines all on it -my fav...a black one with like figures of people dancing that are like neon tyedye ish -grand prix lookin one, black and white checkers -tye dye hearts -blue stars -purple with bats  i know, sexy. i gotta go work on it.   MATT IF YOU ARE READING THIS, CALL ME. I NEED A REALLY HUMUNGOUS FAVOR that involves my stupid paper. You love me, so ya know. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.  Gotta go, though, all...Josh T is annoying and I hate his shoe.  Have a nice life, I'll be around as soon as possible, my lovelies. Adios.

      I am bored. Actually I'm not. I'm only here because I went to go put a new poem in MAiM *curtsy* and entered this blog by habit. But I figured while I'm here I might as well write. Ok, Mistress was messed up so bad and I was mad at her yesterday but she gave me this poem and it made me cry. So I told her FUCK YOU because I was so mad that she keeps telling me I am her angel and asking me to save her, and then doing all of that shit over and over. (nOW I KNOW WHY...thats another story) but anywho...we tend to communiate thru poetry, so here goes. I wrote the following as a response to hers...:  "Mistress, this is for you and no one else. The only thing in disguise has been my fear. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough to save you. Maybe I've been so deaf to hear.                                                                Or maybe you just don't scream for me anymore. Maybe you don't ask for my assistance. I think that the drugs are just locks and chains and you've grown too weak to resist it.  But I don't know what it is exactly, so I don't know what to say. If you still think I'm perfect, I still think you're wrong, but I'll stay here anyway.  Let me know..."  and then she wrote me back with:  "Here I go again crying over your words                                     what was there to scare me into doing this These drugs lock me inside my nothing When I tried to scream I lost my breath just like I lost my heart you Its hard to know whats real anymore Mademoiselle I love you and I need whether I can say it out loud or not I am waiting Angel take me away and save me...."  and last night I wrote her a wicked one that is in my bimder sumwhere (ill type it later...maybe...its kinda....INTENSE) but yeah, I just commented in her journal where she put the above poems with this:  "Mistress, you've done nothing wrong, unless you consider breathing a sin. Though the air you inhale is filthy and dry, You can blow it back out again.  And anyway last night I sat, huddled in the corner of my room, smoking one of Matt's cigarettes and writing a poem for you.  It was about feelings and the way I want to fall. It was about passion and the turquoise of your walls.  It was about the joint  that I'd wish you'd pass to me for once. It was about breaking through  the locks that have held me for months.  But I don't want to go back, I just want you to step up with me. I don't want that shit to bind you. I just wish I could set you free....."  ans that it what I was going to put in MAiM. *DUCKS* but now i am going to die. I am a hypocrite. Aye, I'm sorry guys, it was so gross. Im sorry Im sorry!! EW EW I feel dirty, I feel like BLECH. And my room smells weird now.  Last night I kissed Creepy Kid.  I think I should go now cuz um...yeah, paranoia like wo.     CRIKEY.

BRIAN BOUGHT ME THAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG OMG OMG I Have to pay him back for it, I dont care what he says. OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG it is my BIBLE. I like green tea now. Brb. Hi sorry. That took like, ferever and a day to help out dad with the truck and dinner and stuff. Anywho...erm... I'll come back later.  Too bizzy.  Later.

      This song gets randomly stuck in my head these days. It used to make me think of Jess and her Steve, but now it makes me think of Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike. And at the resteraunt, I finished TITHE.  HOLY CRAP . The very last page, while reading it, the HUGEST GRIN spread across my face and I couldn't get it off. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. I mean, WOW. This whole KNIGHTS-ARE-MY-LASTEST-INFATUATION thing is like, the best. You have NO IDEA. I am in love. I want this book to go on and on and screw Kaye, I want it to be all about Roiben. At first I hated Roiben and like LOVED Naphamael, but now it's completely backwards. Well, Naphamael's hotter, still, no matter what, with his skin all burned from the iron eyebrow ring. :-D :-D and the cloak of thorns, wo. But still, I love Roiben to Death now. I want him. I wish I could make him so very very very very very very very very real. Hehehe. I really really love Roiben. I bet I will dream about him and everything. Ew, the Ironsiders called him ROBIN. haha, it takes way too much away from him. He is so very elegant. So loyal, so...commandable. Wow. I am so head over heels for a character in a book. Hahaha. Oh well, it's fun to be in love. I can't get my heart broken this way, can I? I don't believe in brokenness, so I guess not. I very much believe in Roiben. Wo. Wo wo wo. :-D I am so like, wow. I think I should shut up because this is probably annoying.  Tonight at the resteraunt, our waitress reminded me way too much of Kerry. Ick. And um, let's see...I made a grown, perhaps married, man smile. It was so like, cool. My hands are actually starting to hurt, believe it or not. Alrighty, I'll be back soon. Have fun  WISHING YOU HAD SOMEONE LIKE MY ROIBEN!!   Ciao.

      Indie has ^this^ song in her profile. Everytime I look at her profile, it makes me think of Jess and Mike, back in the day, before I even met Mike, like...the night before or something. No, more than that, but still.  Matt, my day was FINE. Shut up, boy. Argh.  I want to be a knight now.  I really do. The only real knight I know is Brian...wo. *Shudder* Dude, no seriously. I wicked want to be a night. Roiben (I almost used his full name *grimace*) has completely changed me. You guys HAVE to read this book. It is better than Sweetblood, which, I have to get back from the Tougster. I can actually sit and type for maybe 5, 10 more minutes, but I think I would like to go finish up Tithe. JC, I am in love with Roiben. That's weird, cuz I DESPISED him at first. He's my ideal character though...like, not like my dream guy, but I see like every character I've ever created in him. It's awesome. I think thats the best I can explain it. I am not worrying about capitals or anything from this point forward because my pinky hurts and id rather not keep it that way.  Ok, here I go....adios.

All the while we were talking to Brian online and LUCIEN FROM BD!!!!!!!! (AYE, we told him we were groupies n he was like "sry cant talk to no groupies" ahahaha) anyway, WOW. Okay, so Brian. I have slowly been realizing that I really like him again, like I used to, but we're good friends. Well, we were. I dont know, things change, all cuza last halloween. :-/ I still feel like crap about that. I miss just chillin with him after school and stuff. Those were the good old days...catchin hispanic frogs named enrique and juan carlos and steven. Yep, miss it.

Not that I am excited or anything...  Don't feel like oochiein' or wallyin', sry. If yer readin this, plz comment, I could use a little lovin'.  (The regular kind.) Perv.  TITHE is awesome. Roiben makes me think of Brian. (Wo.) I just realized how much I bet Roiben is my fav. character in the book...maybe even over Corny and Gristle.  Wanna chill all week after exams.  Let me know.

       NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY NOBODY WANTS TO CRY MY BODY'S LONGING TO HOLD YOU SO BAD IT HURTS INSIDE!!  TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT'S SLIPPING AWAY AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL OF MY LIFE NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY, SO WHY, WHY,  WHY WON'T YOU LET ME LOVE YOU?     Last night, EL carnival, long story...took a long time to get there, had to go to nic's little kids clubhouse place and listen to "hickory dickory dock" over and over and over and over and stare at pictures of angelina jolie (WOOOOOOW) fer an hour before we were off to greg's uncles fer directions and we still got wicked lost on the way to the carnival but ok to make a long story short here's the summary of what happened las night thru to this mornin as told to Matt like 2 seconds ago:  i went to the el carnival that everyone was at and i was loopy on this prozac n like all my worst enemies were there so me and greg and maureen and this kid derek who maureen is like in love with who is like one of my new best friends despite the fact that he has the same name as my backpack, we left and drove around, ended up at chill spot where i freaked out cuz i was so fuckin jealous of maureen n this kid so everyone flipped n drama drama drama n then we had to SPEED Like all hell back to the carnival to get maureen back to get picked up thurr and then we hung out in the car n talked till i had to be home n i got home n said goodnight to amy and shes like "megan" and i turned around n shes like "you smoked" n i was like "ya" n started bawlin but we talked and talked about it n it was ok and then my dad came home and i told him, i wouldnt let him hear it from anyone else n he was real cool with it and glad it made me wanna puke n then this morning i callededed my mom at work n told her n she actually didnt flip she was glad i was honest n told her and stuff which was my intention and they all just said its ultimately my desicion but please dont smoke its bad u will die the end     there's a lot more to it than that, but so what. it was my night, not yers.

      I am listening to this slow song on the FINCH cd, I'm not sure what it's called, but its pretty and slow and its the kind of music I want Ironside to be so bad. Did I write yesterday? Oh yeah, but it got deleted...gr....ok. So here's what's up...I went to this new psychiatrist in the am yesterday and she's cool tho her boobs were like hanging out but whatever she put me on Prozac now, and I just took my 1st pill, so I'm wondering how tonight will go. Tonight I am going to the EL Carnival with Greg and Derek and the cool Derek (hehe) and we're gonna meet up with Mistress. Um, hmm..o ya I remember. Um, ok I remember the el carnival 2 summers ago, the summer of Kerry (last summer I worked at the cape all summer) and I went with Kerry and this kid Pat Boss who I have the best story about. Anyway, I could tell you what I was wearing that night cuz I remember it so much. Pat Boss, one of those one hit wonder kinda boys, ya meet em, ya crush, ya hook up, ya flirt A LOT, ya wanna go out but u have no idea if you could consider it a relationship. Aka,  SUMMA LUVIN!!  But yeah. Pat's sn was BOSS404. That's where my obsession with the number 404 started way back in the day. It didnt mean anything then, but things change, ya know? I got to go eat lunch, be back.

      I am listening to the Rascal Flatts   MELT  cd and it is SOO good! I have been listening to this and Chris Cagle soo much ("cuz the chicks dig it") aye aye aye! Ok so after I finished writing in here yesterday, Mistress and I walked and we ended up that Blue Moon coffee roasters and Stephanie was thurr with (her mom?) HAHA ITS TUESAY! Anyway, Mistress got this Raspberry Italian Soda and it was mad good and then we tried to play chackers with the big huge chess pieces on the big chess table but didnt realize that you could only put your pieces on the black squares and you could only move diagonally. Hahaha. Then we found a regular size checkers so it was ok and we playsed and i was like kinged 9 times on one guy n she was gettin mad but she had all my guys n i had only jumped like one of hers hahaha and i stacked em so high that when i needed a knew one i took the chess knight (;-)) hahahaha. It was fun. *BOYS ON BIKES* hahahahahaha and then we walked back and blick and then we were at moms n we hung out in my room listening to Rotten Fun and Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo Echo and then her mom came and picked her up and then I did all my usual unsort and resort my binder type cumpulsions until greg called and saved me and i felt like rambling so i described in excruciating detail like every last item in my room hahahaha. It was fun. but then we talked for real, about this CD we're making, about like personal shit, all kinds of things, whatever, ya know. Then I almost fell asleep so we got off the phone and then I was gonna call matt but it wasn't all that late. I haven't heard or seen from him...i told him about the flameling, right?? I think so...but not the other? O hell, I dont know.  WOULD SOMEONE JUST START COMMENTING FOR REAL ON MY STUPID JOURNAL!? I sit here and type this all out fer my fans and i want some luvin back guys, come on. Why should I have to do all the work?? LOL. Rascal Flatts are good. Ok so Mom just got all pissy cuz i couldnt wake up at 6m like thats anything new *rolls eyes* aye aye aye. I miss school already. Yesterday was a blast though. It truly was. I want every day of my summer to be like that. I have to make plans today for tomorrow and thursday and everything. This morning I have to go get an evaluation from my psychiatrist. Some new lady or something...I hope that I don't start bawling. I'm sick of happy pills. I am. Aye, I wanna be normal again!!!! (I never thought I'd say that...) but really. I don't know. I guess the summer will help, it better. IT BETTER!! IT really BETTER! Otherwise, arrrgh. Nah, it will. Hanging out with Greg and Mistress and Derek now too I guess, it will be fun. They're like my bestest friends ever. Even more than Matt and Dove and Indie now because I don't see them as much and now they don't go to the mall anymore because Indie got kicked out or whatever...so BLAH. SO yeah, Derek and Mistress are like the new vinny and tasia of that little group i   LOVED   But i am warning both of them right now if they sit in the back and make out to the point of almost screwing i will go find that guy that had that chainsaw and steal it. AYE. Mistress, ehh, you know what I said about it yesterday. I meant that. Yeah apparently Derek was like freaking out that Mistrss liked him or thought he was cute or whatever. He is so getting the there-is-no-way-in-hell-you-are-hurtin-my-baby-or-i-really-truly-will-get-that-chainsaw talk from me next time i see him. He wants greg to give me his number so i can give it to her, and vice versa. Haha, what if we don't? HAHAHA. It's weird that one of my new best friends has the same name as my backpack. That will get weird. Esp. pppl that know us they will be like "why does ur backpack say DEREK on it?" o wait...THEY ALREADY DO THAT!! HAHA. Anyways, yeah. I found all my old rough drafts of  Is It Raining in California?  and it made me miss Ant a lot but oh well, right? Wait till we actually make the stupid song (if) and then let him hear it. HAHAH. Dad's in the shower, and I'm willing to bet when he gets out he'll wanna talk about something or other, and then I'm gonna have to pull a superman and like change wicked fast and then go. Aye am I gonna miss Derek today. (THE BACKBACK, GUYS. shush) Eh, whatever, I guess. I hope this appt. isn't like blech. Like, I hope she's just like are you sad? Okay cool bye. Not like Have you done this in the last 13.6 hours and have you done this at all ever and was it good? Haha, nah, But I hope its not like dad is sitting there either. I don't think so, cuz Dr.K asked him to leave, but whatever. Its not talk therapy, so that's good, I don't like talking about my feelings unless I am trying to save someone else or something like that. Yeah.....blah. It's 8:21, my appt. is at 9, but ya know how Dad is. (or do you?) Aye...I better get going now. I hope you are all happy that I am writing regular size entries again. YOU'RE WELCOME!!! (to leave a comment) mwahaha. :-D :-D Lata Gata.

      Today was so gnarly!! Ok I wokeded up and went to the padres and then went upstairs n realized i had no bra hahaha and then i found one n i was happy n then i went downstairs to go sit outside and read n get all tan and sexy and whatnot and then like as I was walkin out dad was all like raaarrrr you need to stop being depressed and crying all the time!! and I'm like what? Dad, im in a good mood. and hes like cummere were gonna talk and so i sat in the office chair and he sat in the big black one and amy was on the phone in the fuckin room where we were tryin to talk (grr) and the babe's in the background like wailing and no one would help him so i bury my head in my knees and dad gets all mad like roar LOOK AT ME AND STOP CRYING im like dad!! LOOK AT  ME !! I AM NOT CRYING! I AM   TRYING  TO BE IN A GOOD MOOD!!! aye aye aye. Urm so anywho he leaves fer ding dongin and i go on the computer n start werkin on the site and talking to *this person who i am not supposed to have talked to apparently and we had a convo about the flameling and the smokeling that have come to haunt me because of what I did...speaking of, ok I havent yet explained this. A flameling is an extremely strong spirit that dances and dances, basking in the victims shame. It is extrememly hard to summon a flameling, even by accident. But it was so beautiful and hypnotizing as it danced and danced in my driveway and i couldnt shut my window I just watched and watched and as it spun and twirled the sparks that flew from its head twisted and melted into stars and the stars burst  and erupted and WOW....wow wow wow. A real flameling. So eloquent. But badness...aye, when a flameling leaves you a smokeling will soon visit you and thats what happened last night. I was in the shower and she was there and she was hissing and viscious and then fierce and her little fangs glittered in the little bit of light. But I was so scared. THANK GODDESS  smokelings cant come near water because it was terrifying!!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG Finally I got her into that crystal and now its freezing cold because of her and I couldnt look in the mirror at all!! I caught a glimpse of myself in the glass of the window and it wasn't me...it was her!!! It was so bad. I tried calling Matt over and over because of the whole Flameling/Smokeling ~ demon thing. I wanted to know if there was anything ever (liek a weird energy or something) between him and demon ever, b/c there has to be a reason I call him Flameling before I even saw this one. I am really scared.  Ok so anyway on to the regular stuff. Greg came and got me at dads and we went ova and got Derek in ludlow and then we went to the mall for all of 5 min to get Greg some adapter-y thingy. Then we drove and drove and Derek smoked and smoked and Greg smoked a clove *bows* and he blew all the smoke in my face *EW* and then we went to mcdonalds and got like a bazillion different things and we stopped in a "chill spot" on the side of the highway and Steve was there hahahahaha in his car, eatin mcdonalds too!!! AHAHAHA! And then we just kinda chilled and me and greg talked and then they all went to set up greg's shit in the back so he could spin records, it was hot, random, but hot. And then like I smoked and it was gross but whatever, I kinda needed to get it out of my system. Blech. But ok then we called Mistress and went and got her (even tho we got lost haha) and we saw dads truck n i was hidin n then we got dropped off and mom as like "ew *mistress* do u smoke" n we''re like...umm....derrrrek (WHO MISTRESS IS LIKE OBESSESSING OVER! AyE!) he's kind cute but hes 14 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHA that is the funniest ever.! Anyways I'm gonna go cuz she is still here and I betcha I am pissing her off. Oopsies.   I luv ya anywho...CRiKEY!  Over n out

      My feelings are all out of whack right now. Really all...screwed up and twisted and tangled. Greg left fer NY tonight, but we hung out fer a bit at the mall and talked and yep. Then they left (greg derek paul) and i hung out with this girl Kelsey who i dont really know but whatever because shes pretty and shes wicked cool and she gets me and thats gnarly. But then guess who i see.....................................loverboy. i kno its him because he is with gremlin and i kno what gremlin looks like without a doubt so i knew it was him so i went over n whutever, but like all night he barely looked at me, barely said a word to me, always just walked away from wherever i was.........and so inside (WWAAYY deep inside) i was sooo crushed but i didnt let it show too much, didnt let it bring me down because i figured i was just overreacting and being stupid and expecting more or something, i dont know.  it just ate away at me inside...it felt like crap. and then Mistress was high n like ehhhh and it seemed like she was avoiding me really bad because she didnt say a word to me and didnt look me in the eye or anything, i dont know. i wgot home, Jesus brought me home, i was playin wit baby jesus in the back and she is so cool!! i luv her!! n jesus was like ima come in n meet yer parents so he came in and just talkedededed ferever and whatever then he left to walk home and mom asked me what was that kid smoking? hahaha. And then i ate some poptarts, the goooood kind, and then went online and talked to Mistress and she said she only didnt talk to me and stuff was because se thought i didnt wanna talk to her cuz he was high, which is true, but i was supposed to sleep over her house tonight and i was going to ask her out so there i go being REALLY crushed. egypt was there and creepy kid and amber and egypt and thats all the important people that i havent mentioned yet i think. HOLY MOTHER i am moving next week guys! ew, not going to think about it. cookie's pist i was writing on his shirts hahahah so my I LOVE BUNNIES one he Xed out the LOVE and wrote hate and then after he wrote AND THEIR MAMAS hahahahaha  i was like cook, do u not get that that just makes the shirt that much better?  haha. so anyway, my feelings are all out of whack for them peoples, and i dont know about loverboy...gotta talk to him...i wanna be with Mistress so bad. I think.    I DONT EVEN KNOW ANYMORE!!!! rraarr rraarr rraarr. I just need to know what people are feeling about me at this point, so i can stop thinking this way.    I'm just sitting here, AGAIN, spinning in this dumb black chair, waiting. AND MA IS PLAYING TONY HAWK UNDERGROUND.

"Never never never never never NO!." multiplicity  "Did you bring me a monkey?" idle hands  "They were killed by ants?" the princess bride  "stop rhyming and i mean it" "does anyone want a peanut?"  That took like forever diet cokes cuz wo. Heh, it was soo much fun though. Whhhee. Great great great night. Anyway, Greg is going away to NY tonight for 1NATION (aye wanna go) and stayin thru the weekend maybe all next week and that sucks because i luuuv chillin with him he is my best friend, eh.  I attempted to write another song *this morning while Mistress was watching Idle Hands cuz ive seen it tooo many billion times. Heh, "I'm not going through all that Tanya." Haha. I could quote those movies alllll day. "Hi doug hi doug hi doug hi steve"  "c ya steve" "that leg's gonna have to come off steve" hahahaha. "she touched my pepe steve." ahahaha Multiplicity is great. I don't wanna go on, I'll make myself sick, not that I'm not already about to puke up a million diet cokes.   if you put "i dont think so", would you?

      I am like out of it. I passed out on my floor face down in the middle of my room ha.ha.ha. Greg woke me up when he called...I dont think I could fall back asleep now if I tried. I mean...ehh it's annoying trying to fall asleep.  But yeah, I'm like in a daze, I have no idea what I am doinf right now. Maureen is home from Brians or whomevers i dont know i guess and I want to hear from her and she is supposed to give me a call like NOW but I guess she forgot or doesn't want to or anything. I don't wanna like seem pushy or whatever the fuck that is, I just want it to go back to the way it was befffoooooore Derek.  Speaking of Dereks, I am getting a new backpack and his name is going to Actual Dave (haha matt) but yeah...thats how goes it.  I am like whhhhaaaa la la la la so I am going to sit and spin in this back black chair like I usually do when I'm just sitting here waiting for that annoying little IM noise and whatnot.   Motherfuckers.   ps...i love FOAMY!

      Hola. *YAWNstretch* Morning.  So much to say, so much to say. Where shall I start? Okay...hmm  NICK BROWN. Ya know when like something happens with you and one of your friends and you don't talk to them anymore...for whatever reason, you just din't. And you think about em a lot, regret how it's all screwed up, all that. Then like, you wanna call em up or IM them or something to get them back in your life, but you don't know what you would say, and you're scared to make things worse? Yeah...Nick Brown. I IMed him last night and MAN that took a lot of balls. But I just kinda sent him that collage thingy I made, and he responded (im still not sure if it was positively or negatively) but whatever cuz somehow we got back to talking and he still wants to meet and all that happy crap. I don't know, we'll see what happens with things I guess. I'm not letting myself get hurt again.  GREG. Heh, last night I was on the phone with him and he was DRUNK OFF HIS ASS and was talking about Nuts! and Kangarooy stuff and how do kangaroos fuck and Nuts! Nuts in a bag! Would you like Nuts with that? Hahahah. You kinda had to be there. Anyway, as funny as it was, I was actually really scared cuz he kept wanting to leave to go pick up paul and junk and I was like NOOOO FUCKING WAY believe it er not Greg there are ppl who CARE about you  and dont wanna c nuthin happen and im not bein stupid about this i love you man yer my best friend in the world. And I would not get off the phone, I had to keep him there, home, because I could not have forgiven him if he had driven drunk, whether something happened to him or not. Yeah its like 9 am and i am exhausted now and looking forward to a day on the ice cream truck, but whatever. Cuz there is nothing I can do and my best friend is safe and that means a helllll of a lot more to me than sleep.  I'm gonna get goin, shower, stretch, all them push ups n crunches n junk that I do now, EAT to prove im not anorexic, call and see how greg is, attempt to make last nights failed plans for tonight, and then sit and wait for the ugly little ding dong cart to pull back up to the house. Eh, I could use the sugaryyyyyyy ice cream today. Sugar is the coolest pickmeup, esp. when yer all in a daze cuz so much just suddenly happened n ya yer happy and stuff but just like....WWWOOOOO. You know what I mean. You do.  But anywhoooo, here I go, shutting up.   Don't miss me too much. Ehh, that's my job.

      I have failed yet again. Fucking babies CRY. Amy made it a point to just LET THE FUCKING BABY CRY SOMETIMES! He's been in the other room...crying. Amy was in the living room, LET HIM CRY LET HIM CRY but no...next thing I hear MEGAN!! DON'T YOU HEAR HIM CRYING IN HERE?? WHEN HE'S IN HERE WAILING FOR 10 MINUTES YOU CAN COME CHECK AND SEE WHAT'S WRONG!! just let him cry just let him cry I say. No eye contact. Bad sign, she's pist. Good sign, I can hold back tears. I wanna run away upstairs and get lost in my somehow now hypnotizing walls, or get lost on Syranus with all the Tearstain people, but NO. NOW she's in the living room, (guess she wasn't before) and there is no way in hell I am walking through there. No, not fucking pride.......it's weakness. I wish Mistress were here. Anyone. I want to be a good angel again. I want to go back to being all happy and graceful (pfff) and wise. Now I have these scratches on my face and now on my heart too...is that what those pains are?? Here I go, writing and writing away all my fear, sadness, pain, whatever. Hiding behind these words, this wall of ramblings-on that I am building that no one is reading anyway. Everything is smelling of cigarettes today and its gross. Maybe its in some of my close frum hanging out with the boys and stuff. Ehhhhhhhh I don't know. I quit tho hehe. I haven't smoked since carnival night. (Dont even remember when that was.) I wanna go hide in my room!! It's so safe in there. It's so....serene in that Megan kind of way. Heh, that's kinda like an oxymoron. Eh, maybe not. I am going to post this now and see if I can do something else and keep my insecurites from driving me crazy like they usually do. The phone is ringing. Oh man, what happens if I don't answer it, hmmm???

      Mistress. Tables turn when you don't even realize it. Or is it the world? I don't know anymore...I'm going to try to stop feeling it. But she broke up with Derek and I am in utter shock. I was really looking forward to her sleeping over tonight but she's at 6flags with this Tricia that she goes everywhere with now. Ehh, I don't know. I'm being stupid again, like the Brenda thing.   Sorry I haven't written in a while. Internet's been down, AHH i know. I have become a re-born tv junky and it sucks but oh well. I stayed home all day staring at my walls and singing at the top of my lungs "break yer heart" by bnl.  Good fucking song.  Word.  Ummmmm hmm what to say? So much. O yes, latest infatuation: MARY-KATE OLSEN. Hahahaha me, I know. Cuz um, yeah. She's anorexic, but she's pretty. I don't know. That has nothing to do with it. Something about her.....aye. I drew a picture of her, its okkkkay but whatever. I have this big scratch down my forehead (RIGHT IN THE CENTER!!!) from nic and it kiiiilllls like a bitch omg omg. Vinny is on the phone talking about Tasia, how he'll never be with her again.  This is a boring random entry, I am distracted. I need to really catch up though. I read Matt all of TEARSTAIN BETWEEN over the phone today and my oh my do I miss that cast, aye. Shadow and Devlin and Sapphire (*shudder*) and Wolf and Elfie/Crimson and the whole gang. I am going to attempt to rewrite it, and that will be very intersting indeed. In the first part, well, the story as it is now, I held back a lot...ya know, with like the sex scenes (haha matt) and all that stuff and the language and the little things I guess. But it's a good, well developed plot for once, so I'll work from there.   I made a really cool collage from scraps of Nick Brown *cringe*'s pictures and poems and journals and things and it looks pretty good actually. I like it. But thats me and I am weird. I hope I can talk to Maureen soon.  And Derek...Bananas are weird--in or out of their pajamas.

      That's a quote from a John Mayer song called "Love Song For No One."  I love someone. I feel so fucking pathetic for it too, because I can't seem to do things right, can't seem to please her anymore. Her spiteful words break my heart in a million trillion pieces. . .and she's not really even being mean to me or upset. I'm pretty glad for that, I think. Grateful, I mean. I don't know. I hope she sees this and understands how I feel, because yeah, she's with someone else and I am stupid for trying to get in the way, but there's feelings inside me so strong that they just kind of take me over. Things were going fine, now all this with her, failing her...and this all with Greg...everything. It's getting all knotted up again, but whatever. I'm gonna fix it this time. I don't know how...but I have a list of things to do this summer, it's pretty long and outrageous, but oh well because I am actually getting through it already and the summer just like started. I have about 40 minutes to type, and I  am hoping I can keep my concentration on this so strongly, on rambling, so that I can keep my mind off of her. I don't know what kept me from being with her, from asking her out. I don't, I don't, I DON'T! And I hate it...I really hate it. No, I regret it, it's sad. I can't stop thinking about her, even with haterboy there, even with creepy kid there, even with matt there, even with Dove there, even with Greg there, even with TJ there, all of them. It's her I know I should be with. Her I know that I can't live without. I don't know. Maybe I didn't see it before because she was just so right there and I didn't know how bad it felt to know  that I could have had her and didn't take it. I got off track....um hold on, Oh yeah, so one of the things on my list is to save HER. I wish I could. I have failed her though.  Oh my God, Mistress. I'm tearing myself apart inside without you.    Demons are pretty too though.

They're gonna try n get it frum the state cuz its like this whack little beach with a beachhouse n a little house and junk thats all abandoned...it's AWESOME holy crap. So hopefully they'll get that.....we got permission from the cops to thro a party thurr today, tho i had to get home before that, but whatever.

      YESTERDAY WAS SOOO FUCKING AWESOME!!!!! OMG, I went to Sam's bday party and it was the funnest ever! It sux that Matt and Jess didn't go, but there were like a bazillion people there coming and going. It was like, Sam, Indie, Mike C, Mike H, Mike F, Krystil, DJ, Sarah, This girl Jessica* who I don't know and some girl that looked like her that I don't know, Creepy Kid, this kid Josh, this kid Chris, Stephanie, Nicki, Tougie, Jay, ROB, um. . .um. . .o well I have a feelin I forgot some ppl. Add me and the puppy (pudge) who I want!! Yep. It was fucking KICK ASS!! Only, the whole time I realized that I really like Sam, like, a lot more than I really thought I did, and it was driving me insane the whole time, and then Indie was there telling me how she feels about me and everything and I kinda still like her but not so much I dont know I never talk to her anymore or anything. Anyway, we all just hung out ferever n it was kick ass and we listened to BD and everyone who knew it was singing and everyone who didnt was like hey this music is good yeah! N then pizza n then cake which they all ran around smushing in each others faces. It was hot. After a while we walked to Indies and then walked to "the Dingo" i guess but it was cool. we went thru the woods n its like these traintracks buh theyre all up high n n stuff it was so awesome up there but then we were all, let's leave, misquitos eating us alive!!! So we headed back and when we were walking were like PLEASE START POURING PLEASE START POURING and it did and we played in the rain and danced in the rain and walked in the rain and jumped in the puddles and Jush even swam in one cuz they were so huge, I mean, we all got DRENCHED but it was like one of the best things that has happened in a while to me. Really, it was like, WOW. Seriously. I can't even shut up about it. So we walked back, drenched, like a mob of us, Mike (f) and Krystil left somewhere along the way, and then we went back to Sam's but everyone just went around back and ran around in all the mud and chased each other with the hose n im like c'mon MUD WRESTLING haha but then Me n Indie n Creepy Kid n Rob go to Indie's real fast to change into her dry clothes n we played dress up haha and I have Indie's clothes on n they are so comfy!! (haha im in Indie's pants!) and then Indie/Rob carried me back to Sam's cuz I had no shoes (they were all wet) and then we said bye to everyone and group hugged everyone and i was on robs back so it was Nuts! an then we got in Rob's car and Sam came out looking like....WOW. HOLY CRAP. I was STUNNED. She came over to say goodbye *and she kissed me*!! Then Rob drove me home n we chitchatted about school and college and senior pranks like we always do when he drives me home but its awesome because he knows what he's talking about and no one ever wants to talk about that stuff really. So thats nice. Then he came n met my mom and stuff then I went in, changed, did laundry, then watched some dumb reality sho (for love or money) cuz Lou had it on the tv and it was the last episode, and let me tell you...it took 2 hours of them going IM SO NERVOUS IM SO NERVOUS before they gave it away in the last 5 minutes. I'm not exaggerating either. It was pathetic. Then I packed the rest of my stuff, went down, watched Family Guy, then fell asleep before sealab and all that good stuff. But oh well. Then this morning I came over here to Dads and went upstairs and went to sleep. Woke up, there are like a million cars here, nannies n cookies n jackies, but i have no idea where anyone is. The end. Haha.  PS- Matt you fucking loser why didn't you come yesterday!?!!? It was SOOO GNARLY! n HAHA I finally figured out who deserves* that one thing u want SOOO badly. Hehe. Dont kill me.   Adios...if no one shows up I'll be back sooooooon.  But fer now I'm done.  Turn me over.

      Heh. Okay, here goes. Did I write yesterday? I don't think so, but I don't remember. Yesterday everyone here left at like 4:30ish and didn't do the password on the computer but I refused to go to the fireworks andyway cuz I could watch em out the window from the kids next door do em crazy nuts, and as it turns out Fitzy was there so heh, go me. I win. Anyway, yeah...so I sat down and plaed Tony Hawk Underground for like hours and jc that game is whhhhhack compared to the others, but whatever. I dont really care. Then I got bored, and watched like Degrassi and My-So Called Life (during which I cried for Rainy because HOLY SHIT....nevermind, gotta c it) and the like Last Comic Standing and a bunch of music videos and then more Degrassi I think, I can't remember. And then finally Night Swim came on and I watched a shitload of Sealab 2021...that show is Nuts!! HAHAHA! And Aqua Teen Hunger Force didn't come on any of the time I was away, nor did Home Movies...those are THE GREATEST SHOWS EVER but oh well. Then finally the fam got home at MIDNIGHT so then...oh no wait, they came home at midnight DURIN Sealab 2021...ooooh yeah cuz I watched Futurama and it was like....MY LIFE STORY! I'm not kidding, holy CRAP! I'm so corny, but it was a goooood episode. SHUT UP MATT I know what you  are thinking, and I cant help that I have become a bad tv junky again, what do you expect?   Ok so theeeennnnn today I went to the EL parade and was bored so I wrote a song and just sat around, then I went on the truck with dad but later than i was supposed to because the parade toook madd long cuz they had to stop it for like a half hour at least cuz some lady like randomly passed out in the street from the heat or something, i dont know, and they made a big scene, but yeah. Then I got home and packed a lot because everything has to be packed by tomorrow and that is scary but this house is just like glowing the STEVE's energy still and it makes me sick to think about. But yeah, then Greg got me and me him and derek and paul went to dereks fer his big bad 15th birthday party (hah) and we went there and candles cake blow (haha) and yeah.

      My teeth hurt, don't know why. Period cramps like wo and it SUCKS like a mother. *Shudder*. Um, OMG guys I am leaving for Seattle at 3 am tomorrow morning!! That's like, not long from now. I know its only noon, but that's like 15 hours, gove or take half the day. I wrote out that answer to that one fucking question Matt asks me constantly that I always avoid because it's like the worst question ever. Anyway I typed an answer once into my computer upstairs that has no internet, no printer, and no K key. It was a lonnnng answer, but it was one of the truest things I have ever written. Seriously, it is like wo. But it just sat in the computer for no one to see. But today I wrote it out so I could have it on paper, and eventually I will type it into here and I want responses to it because it means a lot to me.  I miss Mistress a lot. I was hoping to see her today but yet again I am stuck at home alone. At least Cookie is here for a little bit I guess, he's gettin Jackie n Pizza n all that fun stuff. I was *painting* last night in the dark during adult swim and accidentally cut straight up into my  right index finger on the side and it hurts like a bitch. It bled and bled, so I got a few *paintings* done. Today I split the wound back open and it bled and bled and bled and bled and bled and bled so I painted summore just so the blood didn't go to waste. Loverboy is online and I want to talk to him. Jackie's here. I want some more lemonade. I don't even like lemonade, but I am like addicted to it now like I am to SCRATCH TICKETS and NEOPETS (Matt shut the fuck up I swear to god)...   OH GOOD NEWS!! I FOUND MY ATMOSPHERE CDS SO I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THEM LIKE NONSTOP LIKE I USED TO BECAUSE HE IS SO AMAZINGLY GREAT!!! Okay, I'll shut up now.  This is keeping me off Neopets but I love those old school wastes of time, so I'll be back.  Love and Sex. Adios.

      Okay, I know you need this.  Here's how it's been... The whole deal with Matt and Steph, well, I don't know. I really don't. Apparently if I hang out with Matt then I am getting in the way of him and Nicci but I have to let Steph spend all this time with him because she likes him and somehow that's okay, that's not getting in the way of Matt and Nicci. I don't know. This is all irrelevant everything because Matt is gay and he knows it. With Loverboy, I am just falling head over heels. Seriously, like, just seeing his s/n signed on makes me smile. I can't help it. So we've been talking. That's good. That's really good. We still barely know each other though, but it's getting there at its own pace and that's the way it should be. That makes me happy. Mom moved to Chicopee. I can't even begin to explain this. There is a barn/shed out back which I call my barn but secretly I really call it the Mud Shed because it is exactly like the Mud Shed that Witch Baby hid in for months, growing. You have to read the book to understand. It calms me down though. I have devolved, too. I have been keeping a glass jar in my backpack with moths and fireflies in it. Well...actually I was able to put them into a plastic cage and keep them outside and the new house, so it's not the same anymore. Yesterday was Meim and Pop's 50th anniversary party! Ben and Lou and I were catching tiny toads that we found. They were seriously smaller than my thumb nail. We had 37. They were sooooo cool. We put them in a huge cardboard box and chilled with them. Then SALLY DARBY was there and we spent the entire afternoon/evening together...talking about things I'm not sure if I care about, school, gangs (haha), being white girls, fashion design (don't ask), etc. On the ice cream truck last night, Dad told me about how like she went psycho and tried to kill herself and had to go through like tons of therapy and all of that this past year and I was like...woah. I think I've been seeing her in the wrong light completely... Mistress...she's been gone camping but for some reason I didn't know that, so I've missed her a lot. Now she's home and that's good but she still loves/misses Karly and has other friends who are actually there and I don't know what to think. For the record, I don't like DEREK SANTOS like that. Um, what else... This thing with Greg I will explain at the end of this entry...I'll put this convo him and I are having now...it's kind of....scary. I don't know.  I *painted* today. For the first time in...a while. Last friday at the mall I hung out with Creepy Kid and Amber and everyone and I became worse addicted to SCRATCH TICKETS and I spent $11 on them and won $8 so really I lost a lot but it was soooo much fun to win! Like wicked natural high, adrenaline rush (like I need it).  My new novella...a journal-type story. I am still really working out the major knots, so it'll be awhile before you even see like entry one. Um...hmm...I am leaving FOR SEATTLE on wed. morning at like 6 am so say yer goodbyes! I am not able to take my phone with me so I will miss you all that much more! I'm gonna leave you guys with that much, because there's too much to take it as it is. Here's the thing with me and Greg.    PLUR 2 28 29: megan SicTransitHero: hi PLUR 2 28 29: are u mad at me or something ? SicTransitHero: no?

SicTransitHero: thats their fault...not urs PLUR 2 28 29: then as it figures ... another one of my friends hooks up thru with my another one of my friends ... on saturday night  SicTransitHero: so what? dont sweat it greg PLUR 2 28 29: then yesturday ... paul and my best friend lauren are goin now goin to hook up ,,,,  SicTransitHero: its not healthy PLUR 2 28 29: and u like derek ...  SicTransitHero: i dont like derek PLUR 2 28 29: and i got drunk two nights in a row  SicTransitHero: kno what SicTransitHero: im going to be fucking honest and straight frward with u here SicTransitHero: u need to get help, take back up yer meds, your not supposed to stop them without authorization, and theres a reason for that...no one wants everything to be shit...FIX IT SicTransitHero: im not trying to be a bitch here, im really not, im trying to tell you how i feel...this is how i feel: honestly im sick of u being sad about EVERYTHING, you are the best friend ive ever had but its hard being around u when yer like that and it sucks. u need to fix it. PLUR 2 28 29: ya u want to kno how i honestly feel....  SicTransitHero: yes, i do PLUR 2 28 29: worthless ... i do nothing but make ppl have more problems ... paul told me .. lauren told me ... derek told me .. ur basically tellin me .. my dad told me ....so i am out .. i am getin outa this shit droppin everyone ... and geting out  PLUR 2 28 29 signed off at 3:50:58 PM.  PLUR 2 28 29 signed on at 3:51:49 PM.  PLUR 2 28 29: and ya kno wat the hardest thing about it all is..... tryin to deal with it and make things better but ppl just throw it back in my face and tell me to fuck off SicTransitHero: know what? PLUR 2 28 29: i can;t control shit any more .. i have nothing i am outaa a job now ... my dad is goin to kick me out ... and i don;t want to be here any more  PLUR 2 28 29: if all ur goin to do is tell me i am idoit and i need to fix things  PLUR 2 28 29: i don;t need u to tell me again i heard it once  SicTransitHero: that makes me extremely PIST that you just said that I am basically telling u yer worthless, nothing even close PLUR 2 28 29: i haven;t talked to u in a week  i call u and i tell me o i have to go ... call u later .. u never call me back ... .my friend shelly i call she told me she would call me back .. never does ... how would u like it if all ur friends  u called said o i got to go i will call u later and they never do  PLUR 2 28 29: wouldn;t that make u feel like shit and then have ur best friend tell u that u have problems and u need to fix them and basicallu stop being depressed cause i don;t like it  PLUR 2 28 29: how would that make u feel ....... PLUR 2 28 29: worthless  PLUR 2 28 29: and i am sry to piss u off that was not my intention of this convo  PLUR 2 28 29: but as it seems all i do now is make ppl mad... have ppl get pissed at me and lose my friends  SicTransitHero: i am trying to tell you how much u really truly are worth but yer just figting it...you can control it, youre not an idiot, but if you really feel like you cant control things then let medicine or something help u regain control. im not kidding...but it sounds like you dont even want to try to fix things, you dont want to make stuff better and that scares me, that hurts me, and i LOST MY PHONE AGAIN! I MOVED OUT OF MY TOWN!! I AM LEAVING FOR SEATTLE IN LESS THAN 2 DAYS!!!! I AM UNDER SOOOOOO MUCH STRESS ok but i am dealing with it as best i can. that might make me feel worthless but id look beyond self pity and i would find out the reason y they dont call me back because maybe they litterally cant and its not their fault and it hurts them to have me tell them that i feel worthless cuz of something that wasnt their fault! SicTransitHero: so if u want to make someone not pist at you, which is what it sounds like, then FIX IT and i am not going to say it again because im nagging now and thats annoying but i mean it, please think about it. PLUR 2 28 29: i am just goin to leave  SicTransitHero: i have been getting death threats ok...im scared about stuff too SicTransitHero: no, please dont SicTransitHero: yer running away PLUR 2 28 29: death threats from who ? SicTransitHero: this kid SicTransitHero: dont worry about it PLUR 2 28 29: ya im runnin away  PLUR 2 28 29: till i can deal with stuff again  SicTransitHero: don't SicTransitHero: you dont like that all u do is make ppl pist, so y r u doin it again by leaving? SicTransitHero: i want an answer PLUR 2 28 29: so i am pissin u off by leaven again ..  SicTransitHero: that and scaring me PLUR 2 28 29: i want to leave i want to go back to NYC where i had a good time planned partys spun records with candy kid , dj du pont , sound stream and others ...  SicTransitHero: i am so scared for u PLUR 2 28 29: y is that scarin u  PLUR 2 28 29: how is it ? SicTransitHero: ive been trying to explain it PLUR 2 28 29: i don;t understand then ... SicTransitHero: ive been trying this entire convo to explain it SicTransitHero: i love you SicTransitHero: yer the best friend i ever had SicTransitHero: and i mean that SicTransitHero: with all myheart SicTransitHero: if this problem doesnt get fixed it will eventually cross some line that will be so bad that...i dont even want to think about it...and then it will be unfixable for real...i dont want to see something happen to you...i couldnt deal with it PLUR 2 28 29: but thats y i go to nyc i can get away from stuff have time to think and we aren't in each pothers way so it won;'t cross that line where some bad will happen ... even time i hang out with u .. yes i love u to as best friend too .. but when i hang out with u more then that comes out .... i feel more ... and i get scared from that because i kno by me haven feelings like then yes something bad will happen soon  PLUR 2 28 29: and so when i go to yc i ca get away from i think about u only as friend then and i am not goin to be hurtin inside ...

I know he's not ever ever gonna read this, but Joe...uh. Fuck it, I can't even say it. Nevermind.   Dust.

      Wowee! Blogger updated itself, so now I can use  c  o  l  o  r  s  and different fonts and sizes and bullets and pictures and such!! THIS IS SO EXCITING! Anyway, I am at Dad's now and realized how many typos my last entry had. Haha. Whoops. Anyway I missed a few things about my trip, but I think you get the point. I AM TALKING TO MISTRESS and I miss her so much!!    SHE IS COMING OVER!!      YIPPEE!!  Anywho...yeah. Through my trip I had that journal and I wrote like a million lists in there. Anyway, people who kept me goin through it all:  1.Tim Lake. Don't know why, don't know how. He lives in NY.  2.My Mistress, but that's no surprise. She keeps me going every second of every day. 3.Matt 4.Loverboy. 5.Nick Brown 6.AJC, that's all I'm saying. 7....joe broska.... I'm gonna stop there and breathe for a second. Lately it seems like there are soo many people who I miss so much that aren't there or whatever. AJC, Nick Brown, *TIM LAKE*, Ryan, Joe, et cetera.  MISTRESS IS SLEEPING OVER TONIGHT! I miss her soooo much. I want to explain my theory of devolution in here, but its not something I can quite make sense of yet. It's getting there. Guys, omg. I have 356 FEATHERS I collected in Washington! I am going to continue to collect...much more slowly out here of course, and piece together wings like Cherokee Bat did for Witch. Anyway...I am talking to NICK BROWN and I miss him and he says he misses me too and he's glad I had an awesome time and he is jealous of me cuz he did nothing.  I want to call Greg, I told him I would every chance I get...but...I listened to my 14 voicemails fisrt (haha) and there was one from him and he was DRUNK and he was DRIVING and calling me and I told him last time he was DRUNK that if he drove ever I would never be able to forgive him. I stayed on the phone with him ALL NIGHT last time because I care about him that much and I couldn't let him leave. He promised me he wouldn't do that and he did. You can't imagine how much that hurts me. not to mention our friendship. Anyway...right before I left he called me upset that I showed Derek that convo that I put a few entries ago because it was between me and him but Derek was worried about Greg like I was and I told him,  I AM GOING TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SAVE HIM.  I told him straight out that I WOULD SACRIFICE MY FRIENSHIP WITH HIM TO SAVE HIS LIFE. And then look what he goes and does. A part of me says I can't be mad because he lost trust in me for showing Derek, but that's his choice and he broke a promise to me and put his LIFE AT RISK and I think that's a lot worse, don't you? He is calling me now, I am not answering until I am sure what to feel.  I get to watch MYSTIC RIVER tonight, yeah! Sorry, I know this is a longish entry and I just typed a long one, but I am making up for a weeks worth of words. Oliver is getting sooo big! I am worried about my party in a couple days because 3 ppl still dont have invites and I cant get a hold of them. :( :( I am really getting stressed about this. And then CRAIG switched my doorknobs so I can't lock my door anymore which means less *painting for megan. But I guess that's alright. I cried my eyes out over it though last night. My privacy is all I have at home. Can't take that away, because then I have nothing left to be there for. I have to teach Mistress to play GOOK because it is such an insane game! SO YOU KNOW, cuz I know you are wondering, GOOK is a card game my extended family created forever ago and is traditionally played at all family gatherings and visits and everything and I kick butt in it now...not as good as BEN, but I'm good. I'm lonely. I miss everybody!!  I'm gonna wrap this up for now because I am just rambling and I don't want the important things to be forgotten when you close this window.  "It's never goodbye. It's always C ya." -john q.   &nbsp;

      Guess who's back? Back again. I AM BACK!  Washington was AMAZING, you have no idea. I am on Craig's computer and I have like no time to write and I don't havemy notebook on me in wich I wrote every little detail of the trip because it was sooooooo great! Anyway, yeah, later on I willtype all of that yummy stuff in. I think i am going to be forced to go to the fether's tonight which means yet another night without Futurama. Last night I got home just in time to see ATHF and then all those other shows and then Family Guy but I fell asleep right before Futurama...graaaar. Anyway...I miss that stuff, a week without it is a lot...I missed *painting, which I did last night because I needed it. Anyway, I want to see Mistress sooo bad.

      Last night was very...interesting. Dennis, Mistress' boyfriend...for now. This morning she was talking to him and found out HE HAS A DAUGHTER WITH ANOTHER GIRL that wasn't even his gf at the time or something like that whole Usher deal. Hah! But he should have told her sooner. She said she will break up with him tomorrow. Last night...I....I was lonely, though she was there, because she has Dennis and said I wasn't allowed to kiss her and I wanted to just hold her so bad and after a while I just kissed her. She kissed me back but I'm like, I'm sorry. She's like don't be. Then I did it again and she stopped me and was like "WhY? WHY do you want to kiss me?" And as Matt says, you dont ask questions like that to the Megan. Whatever. So stupid little Megan went downstairs and filled an empty bottle with some of Dad's wine and SHIT IT BURNS but idiotic Megan got herself drunk and prozaced up and such. I don't know. I'm all like....blah. So I talked to Matt and Fitzy on the phone all night and just rambled and I didn't puke!! :-D cuz I wanted to. This morning I haven't eaten really. I tried multiple times. My head hurts and my ears ache and I feel like shit and I'm tired and we watched LOSER which is one of those good movies that put you in one of those moods like...I am going to change something. But the feeling lasts for like 2 seconds. I have been trying to write myself through this but all my words in my head aka thoughts are FUCKEDEDEDED up. I cant think, so yeah...  DUST...  &nbsp;  *pukes*

      Mistress is getting here any second, or at least, I thought she was. I guess she's not getting here for another hour now because of dinner. And my Dad made a big deal about how I am sitting down to eat with everything, Miss is no exception, and so now I have to eat. It's like..shit. I talked to Dove today and we talked about what she said in her comment a couple entries ago and yeah she's tiny but I've always seen her eat and she always has energy so it was a shock to me, but now that I am there I understand. You only eat when you NEED to. Like neeeeeed to to function for something or whatever.  On a Coke commercial it says "GOT A CRUSH ON MEGAN." yay!  I'm lonely. I have been really lonely that like watching a regular movie makes me want to hold the person I'm watching it with, wanna curl up next to them, kiss them, you know the feeling. So anyway, this commercial is getting on my nerves with "I bet your favorite color's black!!" Ugh. Rah, the only music station on this tv is BET so the RapCity ppl need to shut up and play their beloved rap shit. Word. They're talking about GOOD CHARLOTTE and it is creeping me out because they are on RAP CITY ahh. What the heck. He's all "gotta love those rock kids" or sumthin, it was weird and a half. I like this song!! Jadakiss' "Why".  I'm gonna go do my profile. I am bored.  Dust.

         I WENT IN THE BATHROOM AND CHOPPED OFF MY HAIR YESTERDAY!     Don't kill me...you'll like it. It's all mad crooked and junk but it's me. Fitzy CONGRATULATED me when I told him because I finally just did what I've been wanting to do and I only didn't before because other people wanted me to keep it long and because I wanted it soooo long so I could braid it in a zillion long braids and whip them at people haha. But that's just not me. So I just did it and now it's gonw and whack but nonethelass gnarly and now I will stop complainging about how I want to shave my head. Mistress is probably coming over, but she's at home high off her ass so I don't know. Yesterday I watched:    &nbsp;  - the virgin suicides : i love cecilia. that movie is so gorgeous, but like lyrical poetry, it has no plot.   - life as a house : holy crap holy crap holy crap I WANT SAM SO FUCKING BAD! Too bad I was watchin it with Cookie cuz that movie got me sooooo fuckin horny haha but seriously everything about him is PERFECT and the alyssa's all "Ew. Hah! You're cleaning out the shower now."&nbsp; Omg what I wouldn't give to be naked in a shower with SAM.   - dead poet's society : I CRIED...a lot...NEIL OMG I AM SOOOOO SORRY!!! NEIL!!!   This movie changed my life  . HOLY SHIT. Neil is amazing.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Anyway Derek says that Greg didn't drive home that night when he was drunk, so Greg, I'm sorry...but what was I supposed to think?!?!    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Joe Broska I will love you until the day I die.

       Um...oh yeah, Friday I wasn't on half a bottle of Prozac. I was undermedicated. Last night though, I took extra Prozac and this is going to sound DUMB but I was seeing like dead people all over the place. It didn't help that a total of 8 people died yesterday in all those movies&nbsp;I watched yesterday but still...I was...ask Matt...I was halloucinating worse than I think I ever have and it was SCARY.    &nbsp;  Sorry for lying about Friday.    I was messed up.  I messed up.

      This morning I watched the MASTER OF DISGUISE like 3 times in a row and let me tell you...besides that one SHREK impression he does, that movie makes me so sick. Don't ask. ugh. Anyway then we had to bring THE ENTIRE BASEMENT upstairs to the garage and I ate some Corn Flakes (*curtsy*) so I was able to do it, but barely. Last night I was on the phone with Fitzy...(yes, i know)...anyway we were talking about stuff and I admitted to myself and to him out loud for the first time that I have a problem with this whole eating thing...I used the A-word, but I don't know. So last night I took the scale out of the bathroom and weighed myself and I weighed 94 pounds!! That's not only disgusting but it's scary. I don't know what to do. I ate an apple last night, go Megan, I know. Rar. Okay, so Matt and I are developing this plan to, because   IRONSIDE   didn't work out because I had VERY LITTLE CONTOL over the production of that, that there is something we CAN do. So...we are  MAKING A MOVIE!   We're not sure just who to cast or what it's going to be about. We're just making sure we have a camera and computers and time and music and all of that that we'll need before we get in too deep. Anyway, if you're interested leave me a comment. I need commitment on this. We can put this together in a week if we really try, so let's just do this. It will be a pretty short movie, which is good. If I have to do like a fun documentary type thing first or a slideshow, whatever, just for practice and such, then I will. I really want to do this, and this is a lot more practical than IRONSIDE was. So yeah...comment, let me know what you think or if you have camera/equiptment or whatever or if to want to be in it or have an idea for a plot or whatever. I don't know. I am so tired. I have been trying to write but I can barely get out of bed. I don't know how I moved all those boxes this morning. I have to go check my email and see if NP figured out about my stolen shit. I'll get back to you all. My neck hurts bad.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Dust.

      I don't even know what to say right now. Last night I talked to Joe again and that was cool because. . .yeah. . .anyway we talked a lot and he's like ok Bye megan and I'm like bye joe and hes like NO WAIT DON'T HANG UP and I'm like wait...wut? hes like AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING. . .? :-D :-D :-D Wo. So yeah. Today was boring. Bouught 40 one subject notebooks. haha. 40. Oh wait, it's like 9:23, supposed to have called Joe 23 minutes ago...I wonder if he's thinking about me. Probably not. I mean, he's at camp HELLO. Anyway yeah...I don't see why he couldn't just call me but I'll call him in a bit and be dumb cuz he probably won't even be able to talk or something with my luck, i don't know. I got in a fight with Greg this morning because of that voicemail I got before and supposedly he wasn't even driving, I don't know. Whatever, i'm too ticked to think. Um let's see...oh yeah, MARK called me today. We talked...well, he talked. I was a little more than 1/2 asleep haha so he's like u should dance since yer listening to ghetto music anyway im like ok so i did and then like passed out and he's still trying to talk to me and i'm like mark, hun, im sleeping. roar. anyway, then i talked to Mistress and SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND who mark says is going to hurt her so bad and " shatter her heart into a million pieces " but he's not going to tell her because everyone has to make those mistakes...only I want to save he but I don't have any evidence on why she shouldn't be with him except for what Mark told me so it will do NO GOOD as far as I am concerned right now. Hah, this morning I came across booktv on c-span2 and this dude Thomas Frank is a GENIUS let me tell you. :-D. I am now a "contemporary conservative" haha. Anyway yeah, yesterday, MY PARTY WAS CANCELLED. Matt and Indie came and hung out anyway and it was kinda fun and I taught then gook (haha SAY INDIE GOOKS....hahahahaha) anyway, ya had to be there. So. . . . .boredom. Blah. I talked to loverboy a little bit...and by a little bit I mean a realllllly little bit. AHhHhHhHh...yeah. He really doesn't like me, but whatever. I'm over it :-D I have my JOE back! Well, I don't exactly have him back back but we have a *DATE* for when he gets back from camp. The first real *date* I've been on in a long time...like...raar. Last time I went on a real date...yeah...not fun. Steven Lucia I will hate you for as long as I am alive. I'm getting bored. I miss Joe.

       Nick Brown has disappeared again, apparently because of his computer this time, I don't know. Anyway, Dani, Lance and Ross I believe are going to play sum of the songs I wrote and I think Rose is gonna sing but I don't know, I've never heard her sing. Anyway, here's what I was working on today...its all just material that needs to be molded and stuff, but yeah, here ya go:   I thought I was your ocean, your deep red sea Your walls dissolving into my waves, melting into me. I thought I was your filthy angel, lemonade tears and all you can eat. I thought you liked the way I cried, watering your seed.  This was all to test my trust in you, To make me crave the lust in you. Please don’t let me fluster you, In your eyes I see how disgusting you’ve become.  Your second chance blew up in your face. Standing pretty as I watch you fall from grace. In my black jeans, in your t-shirt, in my underwear of lace. I hope we never hug again ‘cause your embrace I am numb.    You fed me fire till I burned You kissed me softly till it hurt   You turned away when I tried to speak You loved me so strong I am weak You sang me all the songs I hate You tore out the pages of my fate I never liked your empathy Thanks for the pretend sympathy You taught me how to make-believe While I painted pictures of your deceit  Step on a thorn, I’ll make you smile Wrap you up in nothingness And let you stay a while.  Step on a thorn, bleed a while Wrap you up in nothingness, I can make you smile.  Step on a thorn, bleed a while I bet I can make you smile.  Your tranquility turns me on, I would like to make you scream. Nothing like a challenge To wake me from this dream.  I’m waiting for the day you come find me and kill me I’m waiting for the night you go down on me and thrill me I’m waiting to be emptied and for you to refill me I’m waiting for a response from you, words that will chill me
