      hey ppl. im bored and yall dont like to put post on here so ill tell u about my great canadian friend. even tho canada is the bitch of the world, she is cool. canada is the bitch of the world, but iraq is a big bitch of the world. just to get that off my mind. now, my canadian friend is depressed coz dick, (her COOL boyfriend), lives in a different province of canada, and because canada such a big bitch, she cant c him coz, her countries a big bitch and she has to come home coz her mommy misses her. i will refer to amy's mother as mum, since that is what amy calls her. well, amy is always cool in my book, even tho her country is a bitch. i dont know why, but i just think canada is full of those french bastards out to get the united states. amy doesnt deserve to live in such bitchy country so maybe my loyal blog fans can create a "save the amy fund" to get her out of that damn bitch country, and hell, maybe cool ass friends too.       :D  i am not sorry for offending anyone who reads this coz they are most likely canadian bitches. thus, hahaha canadian bitches, i have just put down your country. HAHAHA!!! i love amy park, that is why i would really support the "save the amy fund". i will make a enormous contribution of 5$. american, coz candian $ is a rip off coz its too damn much. well i better go before the canadian like CIA type thing, kills me. my friend, (no name mentioned for her or his own protection), tells me the canadian bitches CIA type thing, is the RCMP and it sucks ass. peace out buddy.
