      Abrams, PA. 1995. Montonic or unimodal diversity-productivity gradients: what does competition theory predict? Ecology 76(7): 2019-2027.  I like this article in a way... which is good since it's pretty important to my thesis... but reading anything by any of the biodiversity theory bigwigs can lead to headaches if one is not cautious.  It's one of those I keep having to re-read since A) it is (or I am) dense and B) I come up with new questions to find answers to or citations for.  Ok... being waved goodnight by a departing professor...  Well, back to reading.

      Ecology has a moving wall of 4. That's 4 years between the time it is published and the time articles are available electronically through JSTOR.  I know this, but I just tend to get overly optimistic and think clicking "find a copy" will work anyway just to be nice, even when the pub date is, oh, Jan 04.  Ach besonders.

      It's been kind of a long day. Going home for dinner, then coming back here.  Picked a field assistant... rather she volunteered... and should have been the obvious choice due to availability, now that I think about it. She doesn't seem to like fieldwork. But she is willing to do it and has done it so far (including today). So... I'm happy with the outcome. She plans to continue next semester so that's less training to do as well. And she is meticulous about cleaning the lab so I think she definitely has attention to detail. Which is a definite plus.  Today was spent searching for chicken wire constructs with a memeber of my committee, not finding them, and then purchasing chicken wire to supplement the roll we already had. So a trip to the hardware store and 5 rolls later.... we have cut almost 2/3 of it to cover my plots. Tomorrow will be spent cutting the remainder, taking it out to the fields, and pinning it down with steel pins. Should be a lot of fun. My new field hat is certainly coming in handy. As is the handy cool-pack neck-wrap thingy I bought at Comfest. With those and my bandana on my head, and wearing overalls, the professor who went out with me and this other guy in his lab (his REU student) laughed and said I looked like I was off to preschool. You see I had my field notebook and a box of Crayola colored pencils in my pocket of my overalls. What can I say, the colored pencils work brilliantly on the "write in the rain" paper. And if that looks silly... well then it's time I came to terms with looking silly anyway.  Besides my previous jobs haven't allowed conveniently nearby places to get water or take a break from the heat... or if they did I wanted to avoid the air conditioning to keep from freaking my body out with the temperature flip-flop. So I dress for fieldwork like I mean it. I just happen to be at a place where you can get away with not dressing hardcore. It sure beats scrubbing stains out of all my jeans every week, and getting sweat stains on all of my comfy shirts.  Ok going home now-- it's dinner time, and I feel like cooking something. Mmm foooood.  Tschuess. I really need to figure out how to do umlauts on this thing.

      This hit the news pipe Friday, but I was a little preoccupied at the time. I figure it's worth a belated post.   urlLink Miami University: News & Public Information Office   They said they wouldn't do it until OSU did it. Well-- both did.  It's rather encouraging that the vote was unanimous.

      It's been about two months since I put in time at school or worked on school stuff at night, except for spider collecting trips (one species we use is nocturnal, so we go headlamping for them). Nighttime used to be a pretty regular thing, as did a day on the weekends. In fact... I may have logged more meals here than in my apartment for a while. Three squares a day. I've been boycotting such things entirely since finals, and have been MUCH happier.  But alas... here I am... I have a whole scary lot of things to do so I think I will be be here at night with increasing frequency prior to my trip to Quebec and afterwards.  Scary.  Also deer at the research center are digging through my plots and eating my productivity treatments. They do not respect the thesis. To say it's a distressing development would be understating it. But there is nothing I can do but deer-proof what's left and make damn sure they can't do it again after the second round of treatment.  Field ecology is not a discipline that allows experiments to be neat and predictable. Ok, so no discipline has such a thing, really-- but we work on such a scale and in such places as to make do-overs much more difficult if not impossible over a given field season.  Ok I left the bar and a dart game I was just getting the hang of at lab outing night just to come check for an email I haven't gotten yet and to work on this thing. So here I go.  Bis spater.

       urlLink Comfest 2004   This is where I am going tomorrow. I didn't hear about it until today.  The thing looks AWESOME. Check it out-- they even have a recycling progam for their own event. That just oozes class.  It'll almost be like being home. I miss being around my progressive Memphis friends like I'd miss an arm, some days.  Ok, it's the end of an unhappy day at the end of a week full of small aggravating events. I'm going home now, to eat spaghetti and console Spasti-cat after a daylong absence of human companionship whilst I click through the Comfest program.  Au revoir.

      Currently listening to these musicians a lot. So much so that my attempts to learn some quick conversational French before I go off to Quebec are being thwarted. Since both require my cd player. Dammit.  Both have origins/roots in Memphis, my hometown.  Ingram Hill.    urlLink  INGRAM HILL   Particularly their first album (Until Now), which sounds more like they sound live, and is not overly slickly produced like the second one (June's Picture Show).   urlLink  GARRISON STARR- MUSIC   Garrison Starr.    Again, I prefer an earlier sound (18 Over Me), which has more of the edge of a live band in a bar. I have yet to try her inbetween albums, having only aquired the most recent one (Airstreams & Satellites) and 18 Over Me. The newest one has some really good stuff on it, it just sounds more pop-ish in a way that I think is producing again. Unfortunately I've never heard Garrison live, and I don't think the Midwest is a near-future tour stop. :(

      To clear up any confusion, my first academic year as a graduate student is over (miraculously, it seems). Being a field ecologist, I actually run my master's experiment this summer. So, while my friends in different sorts of programs are studying for comprehensive exams and/or seeking summer employment, I'm getting credit and a (none too large) summer stipend to bascially do research full time. Which, hey, is nice, lack of regularly sized paychecks aside.  My field experiment involves no-till soy plots, so I've been biding time with other tasks and readying for the actual fieldwork whilst the soy was planted, sprayed with herbicide.... etc. Sunday and Monday I flagged my plots within the fields, and tomorrow (!!!) I get to go till the 60 2x2 m plots. My mom commented on her visit in early May that doing something so agricultural was more "like" me.  Hmmmm.  There is a trend I have noticed. The hotshots-- meaning arrogant people, who may or may not be talented, that varies quite a bit, ironically-- drop out of challenging things much more often than I ever expect them to. And I have thought about quitting during what I hope was the worst of it, but I didn't.  Hrrrrrm. Curioser and curioser, says Alice.  This weekend an email from a college friend informed me that I seemed to be getting along with grad school very well, whereas her other friends who went into grad school in biology all quit after the first year. Hmmmm. If she means who I think she does, there are these two guys who got fellowships-- money, no teaching, for the first year if not 2 years. I got a package which, for my school, is really good, but compared to other schools, it's decent but nothing flashy. I only TA for a year, and that's done now, and the remaining year is a Research Assistantship-- paid to do my own lab work. Which is sweet, and typical of grad school, but many Master's students here don't get a full year of an RA. They get half a year. So I've been content with my situation, award-wise. And I get research money to travel on since I am collaborating a bit. So it's all good. But this time last year, as a senior in college, to hear the pompous ass twins got really good deals and didn't have to TA was disheartening. Well, I survived TAing, and am still here fighting it out. So I'm rather proud of me, which is a good thing, since there have definitely been times this year when I started planning in my head the steps I would need to take to pick up and leave the program. Right down to packing my clothes. That's a lie-- I was planning packing my clothes without having figured out the important things, like my lease or whether my advisor would ever speak to me again. But I had the socks in the boxes, and was wondering how expensive apartments that allowed cats are in my hometown, and if the zoo needed any keepers. Alas.  Ok I've spent an hour and half not working when I should have been. Time to tweak some things in a file I'm working on and go home to shower. You see, I smell like gasoline. Why? There was a potential tick issue due to a cicada collecting trip outside in my not-field jeans, so I changed into my snazzy fields overalls upon my return from the field, which still smell of gasoline after yesterday's adventures. Which I could possibly relate in a later post. Hence I look incredibly sexy and smell like gasoline, and am inside my office in said state. Which is why a shower is necessary before I go to a music festival with a friend.  The interesting question, really, is whether to bike home in the gas-overalls or the tick-jeans.  Over and out.

      Two places on the internet to goof off while eating your lunch. I haven't visited either in awhile but hey, it's lunchtime, and I am back out to the field in 30 min. &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.penny-arcade.com   urlLink http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-05-06&amp;res=l   urlLink http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2002-06-07&amp;res=l  &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.homestarrunner.com/   urlLink http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html  &nbsp; 30-40% chances of rain the rest of the afternoon... wish me luck!

       97X is back! It's the return of independent radio, but only on the internet. &nbsp; &nbsp; They can tell the story of their history, ending, and new incarnation better than I can:  urlLink http://www.woxy.com   &nbsp;  I miss it on my radio at home. :( I do turn the dial off of NPR occasionally.

      It's not every day a catsitter leaves your key and a note written on the back of the tab from a box of tortellini in your apartment while you're at work. &nbsp; Did I mention my apartment isn't too neat right now? So, maybe that's a frequent state for it... it has been much worse... but I am itching to clean it. But am here a lot. &nbsp; I just read an article for lab meeting which found that the females of a species of wolf spider (Schizocosa uetzi) prefer to mate (and prefer not to cannibalize) males of a phenotype by whome they were courted as subadults. In other words, they're attracted more to males who hit on them before they were mature. &nbsp; Who says biology isn't fun? This will be an interesting discussion tomorrow no doubt. &nbsp; Time to write about productivity and species diversity!

      The Federal Marriage Amendment got struck down in the Senate today. Hooray.  Kerry and Edwards didn't vote. They're the only Senators who didn't. Which changes their status in my worldview: they've been demoted from Flaky to Spineless. I seriously doubt this is anything but a tactic to ensure they walk that "safe" road of the inoffensive moderate: avoid taking a clear stance on anything that might potentially lose the votes of a critical demographic group. I'm sure there was some sort of schedule conflict on the campaign trail. The purpose of which is to win the confidence of key demographic groups of voters, which ironically includes the GLBT vote.  This is from their website: "John Kerry believes that same-sex couples should be granted rights, including access to pensions, health insurance, family medical leave, bereavement leave, hospital visitation, survivor benefits, and other basic legal protections that all families and children need."  All of the senators from my home state (TN) and current state (OH) voted Yea. I voted for one of them, thinking he was rather biparitsan and looking into his platform but definitely not well enough into his voting history. In hindsight, voting history matters a hell of a lot more than what a candidate claims to support.  The best thing to do to protect rights is to vote against bills that threaten them. Which Kerry and Edwards failed to do today. And so failed to earn my confidence, or my vote.  For more information:  Human Rights Campaign .

      Back in OH after 10 days near and in Montreal, Quebec. May I say it is a beautiful city. The town I was in on the west side of the island was as nice as a small town can be in my eyes. The mix of Canadian French and English can be rather confusing, more so than my almost complete lack of French comprehension alone can be responsible for. Being told directions in English as follows threw me for a bit of a loop: "...take a left, at the corner, then the first right after the  dépanneur  (convenience store)." Ack.  Learned a lot of spidery stuff there, and got to go to downtown Montreal twice. Went to the International Jazz Festival and the BioDome/Insectarium/Botanic Garden triplex. First time I ever just gave up on seeing all there is to see at such a place, it was so big! I know know my limit-- 6 hours of intense sciene museum-ing is where my stamina ends.  Well, I actually came here to work but saw a news annoucement I will now post next.
