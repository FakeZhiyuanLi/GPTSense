						    urlLink Bush Admin Planning on canceling or rescheduling election in November    The government needs to establish guidelines for canceling or rescheduling elections if terrorists strike the United States again, says the chairman of a new federal voting commission. Such guidelines do not currently exist, said DeForest B. Soaries, head of the voting panel. Soaries was appointed to the federal Election Assistance Commission last year by President Bush. Soaries said he wrote to National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge in April to raise the concerns.    I was wondering what the Bush Admin was planning on doing if it looked like he wouldn't be re-elected. Most pundits say that if there is another terrorist attack it will help Bush, but just in case it doesn't they have a fall back plan to postpone the elections until it is safe to vote again. Very convenient. Anyone complaining will be branded as un-American and unpatriotic to suggest we do something as frivolous as vote when our Democracy is at stake! Heavy sarcasm here!

						   I was reading the transcript of an  urlLink interview Larry King had with Ron Reagan Jr.  in which the topic of embryonic stem cell research came up. I will quote a section that I found very interesting:   "It's astonishing to me that we are even having the conversation about this. We're not talking about fetuses, human beings being killed, we're talking about collections of cells in a petri dish that are never, ever going to be a human being. This could be the biggest revolution in medicine ever, well, ever really. Bigger than antibiotics. Bigger than anything.  "And you know what strikes me, too, is that you cannot be against embryonic stem cell research and be intellectually and therefore morally consistent, if you're not also against in vitro fertilization. Because the same thing results in in vitro fertilization. Thousands of blastocysts collections are discarded. Now you'll notice that most of the politicians who are against embryonic stem cell research don't say anything about in vitro fertilization. You might wonder why. Well, it's because what are they going to do, come out against people who want to get pregnant? That's a political non-starter so they're going not going to -- they are just going to shut up about that and go after stem cell research instead. They're playing politics with it and it is shameful. It is shameful."  Interesting point. I wonder what politicians and Church leaders who oppose embryonic stem cell research would say if they were asked to explain why they are not opposing in vitro fertilization in which fertilized human eggs are routinely discarded? It would be a good question if they were willing to answer, which I doubt they would.

						   I posted a comment in  urlLink HockeyTown4Ever Ramblings  which is another good source of news info that the TV News in the US usually doesn't tell you. My comment involved the recent push from Roman Catholic Cardinals and Bishops to withhold communion from Politicians who do not oppose abortion. Keep in mind that I am Pro-Life, and do not support abortion; although, I do not and will not pass judgment on others who have found themselves making such a difficult decision. I am trying to get discussions between Pro-Life and Pro-Choice people on a common solution. More about that later. Here is my comment to the news about Catholic Cardinals and Bishops calling for withholding of communion to Politicians who do not oppose abortion publicly:  As a Pro-Life Catholic I find it morally indefensible that Bishops and Cardinals are denying (or even talking about denying) communion to politicians if they don’t take a public stand against abortion, when these same Cardinals and Bishops are completely ignoring politicians’ stances on other teachings of the Catholic Church. This cherry-picking from the teachings of the Church shows that this is purely political. To clarify: the Catholic Church teaches that capital punishment is murder, also the Pope and the Church hierarchy have repeatedly stated that the Iraq War was not a “just war.” Non-just wars (wars waged which did not need to be waged) are also murder according to Catholic teaching. To be Pro-Life requires that you respect the gift of life given by God and that life must not be taken through murder. So these same Bishops and Cardinals should be refusing communion to politicians who support the death penalty and the Iraq War, but they don’t do they? Catholic teachings come down very hard on Conservative views on the treatment of the poor and minorities, but the Republican Party has been woefully unsupportive of those groups deciding instead to cut funding to those not wealthy enough to be campaign contributors. If you are truly Pro-Life you must be respectful of life from conception to grave. And the Republicans strike out on every step after conception. I have written polite letters to some of these Church leaders asking them why they aren’t for denying communion to politicians who support the death penalty and the Iraq War but they will not respond. One Bishop, Bishop Sheridan of Colorado, has gone so far that he has threatened to withhold communion from lay people who vote for politicians who do not take a public stand against abortion. Exactly how this mind reader is supposed to know how the faithful have voted was not explained. He was hoping that the fear that he might know would be enough to get Catholics to vote Republican. Keep in mind that George W. Bush visited Bob Jones University when he ran for president in 2000. Bob Jones University teaches that the Pope is the Anti-Christ, and Catholics are minions of Satan. That doesn’t seem to prevent these esteemed Church leaders from trying to steer Catholics from voting for Catholic John Kerry and voting instead for Bush who belongs to a group of Evangelical Christians many of whom claim that Catholics are not Christian. (Note: I know a number of people who belong to non-denominational evangelical Churches where this is preached and brochures making baseless claims about Catholics are handed out. I also listen to Christian radio stations in my area where the claim that Catholics are not really Christian and need to be converted from their non-Christian religion is constantly preached.) Also keep in mind that some Bishops and Cardinals hid pedophile priests from the authorities shuffling them from parish to parish without the parishioners knowing about the charges. And now Cardinals and Bishops are cherry-picking from Church teachings in order to tell us how to vote? Their hypocritical behavior is driving American Catholics away from the Church in droves, and Republican Protestants like Bush are laughing up their sleeves. If they don’t wise up to what they are doing they’ll find themselves preaching to empty churches.   I don’t want you to get the impression that I am against Protestants, I am not. There are many areas in which the Catholic Church could learn from Protestants. I am not against the Catholic Church either. It has areas where improvement is needed, but on the whole I am very supportive of the faith in which I was raised. It’s when a few pumped up Church Bureaucrats decide that they can try to use their position in the Church to pressure the faithful on how to vote especially when they ignore other Church teachings which undermine their political positions it makes my blood boil!!!!

						   Earlier this month  urlLink The New Republic  reported that several officials in the Pakistan government said that the Bush Administration had been pressuring them to capture a High Value al-Qaeda Target (HVT) during the last week in July, that is during the Democratic National Convention. This would cause the news reports to focus on that story instead of John Kerry. Sure enough hours before Kerry gave his acceptance speech, Pakistan dutifully obeyed the White House and  urlLink announced  that they had captured Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian Al Qaeda operative, billed as a "top al-Qaeda man" and the "Most Wanted Qaeda Man" despite the fact that no one had ever mentioned this "Most Wanted Qaeda Man" before (isn't Osama bin Laden the "Most Wanted Qaeda Man"?) and every person who is said to be associated with al-Qaeda and is captured is announced as a "top al-Qaeda man" (there must be thousands of "top al-Qaeda men" based on all those that have been reported captured already). The Corporate News Outlets dutifully obeyed as well and reported this top al-Qaeda man's capture downplaying John Kerry's speech. Gee, what are the odds. Several Pakistani government officials say that the Bush Administration is pressuring them to capture a High Value al-Qaeda Target during the last week in July, and it just so happens to occur. Wow, what are the odds? Kerry picks his VP running mate and the same day, John Ashcroft announces a terrorist plot in Ohio that had been foiled a month earlier but not announced until that day. Again what are the odds? And every time Bush's popularity numbers dropped last year, they would announce another terrorist alert color change try to boost those numbers. Why isn't the media reporting these abuses as the political shenanigans and direct manipulation of the public they are? Because, dear readers, the Corporate owners of the networks, radio stations and newspapers benefit from Bush's presidency through FCC rule relaxations and other quid pro quo favors. When will the American people learn the truth?

						     urlLink Forbes Magazine Aticle Here   Presidents and prosperity  Economy did best when Clinton was in office  Clinton's two terms in office, from 1993 to 2001,&nbsp;were marked by strong numbers that put him first among the ten postwar presidents.  By Dan Ackman  Updated: 2:15 p.m.&nbsp;ET July&nbsp;21, 2004  The death of Ronald Reagan and the popularity of Bill Clinton's book have sparked an unusually intense interest in presidents past.  &nbsp;  During the week of his funeral, several commentators declared Reagan the best president of the 20th century, even better than Franklin D. Roosevelt, whom Reagan himself admired. A recent Gallup Organization poll indicates that Americans rank John F. Kennedy slightly ahead of FDR, and both of them ahead of Reagan. Clinton supporters, meanwhile, note that he turned large federal deficits into surpluses and presided over a booming economy.  It's the kind of argument that will never be settled, like who was a better ballplayer, Willie Mays or Mickey Mantle. But we took a look at the numbers, and for the money, among presidents since World War II, Clinton scores highest.   &nbsp;&nbsp;Rank  Presidents and prosperity  Rank  President  1.   urlLink Bill Clinton   2.   urlLink Lyndon B. Johnson   3.   urlLink John F. Kennedy   4.   urlLink Ronald Reagan   5.   urlLink Gerald R. Ford   6.   urlLink Jimmy Carter   7.   urlLink Harry S. Truman   8.   urlLink Richard M. Nixon   9.   urlLink Dwight D. Eisenhower   10.   urlLink George H. W. Bush    Source:  urlLink Forbes.com   Clinton's two terms in office (1993-2001) were marked by strong numbers for gross domestic product (GDP) and employment growth and especially for deficit reduction. His overall ranking puts him first among the ten postwar presidents — ahead of Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy and Reagan, who were tightly grouped behind the 42nd president and recent autobiographer.  To create our rankings we looked at six measures of economic performance — GDP growth, per capita income growth, employment gains, unemployment rate reduction, inflation reduction and federal deficit reduction — for each of the ten postwar presidencies. For each measure we looked at whether the situation improved or got worse, and we ranked the presidents from 1 to 10. We then averaged the ranks to come up with a final score. ( urlLink Click here for the complete underlying data. )To be sure, there is a sharp debate as to the ability of any president — or government — to control the economy. But that doesn't prevent the heads of Wall Street firms such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup from rooting for one candidate over another based on expectations of economic performance. Fairly or not, each president was judged by how much prosperity is delivered on his watch. Some presidents, it seems, have watched a lot more effectively than others. (We did not rank the current president, whose term is not yet over.)  Behind Clinton's successClinton campaigned on the economy and had remarkable success. GDP growth during his eight years averaged 3.5 percent per year, second only to the combined Kennedy/Johnson years and ahead of Jimmy Carter and Reagan. The economy also added jobs at a faster rate under Clinton than under any postwar president except Carter.  For Carter, however, job growth merely matched an increase in the size of the labor force, while Clinton had much better luck curbing the unemployment rate as well. The result: The public's confidence in the economy hit an all-time high in the summer of 2000, near the end of Clinton's second term, according to Gallup. In the summer of 1992, before he was elected, it was at an all-time low.The key to Clinton's success, says Alice Rivlin, a Brookings Institution scholar who served as his director of management and budget, was adhering to the "pay/go" agreement first forged by President George H. W. Bush and a Democratic Congress, whereby tax cuts or entitlement increases had to be funded on a current basis. She says Clinton raised taxes at just the right time — when incomes were starting to rise after years of stagnation — leading to a surge of receipts. The result was the smallest government in terms of its percentage of GDP since Johnson, and the first substantial budget surpluses since Harry S. Truman.  Johnson ranks second-bestJohnson (1963-1969) ranks second-best overall, slightly ahead of Kennedy, some of whose economic policies he shepherded through Congress. LBJ was first in terms of both GDP growth and personal income growth. He was also among the best in reducing unemployment, lowering the jobless rate from 5.3 percent to 3.4 percent. But his time in office was also marked by a surge in inflation and government spending, which got worse under his successor Richard M. Nixon, who instituted wage and price controls with little success."The Vietnam War had the biggest impact [of any single factor under Johnson] both for good and for ill," says Charles Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Johnson and Carter administrations. Schultze says the Kennedy/Johnson tax cut helped the economy continue to grow in 1965 and 1966. But the failure to finance the war led to a surge in inflation that continued under Nixon. Despite these problems, the JFK/LBJ era, viewed as a whole, was the best of times.Kennedy's presidency (1961-1963), truncated by his November 1963 assassination, ranks third behind LBJ's. Following the prosperous but slow-growth 1950s, Kennedy, like Clinton, campaigned on the idea of getting the company moving again. His most well-known economic legislative initiative, however, his 1964 tax cut, did not take effect until after he was dead.Without a clear supply- or demand-side explanation for the boom, Walter Schubert, a finance professor at LaSalle University, suggests that JFK's impact was largely exhortatory: "My sense of Kennedy is that he inspired a lot of people to try things." While many businessmen feared his election, they responded to his energy. In any event, GDP growth averaged nearly 5 percent during his term and he ranks first in reducing the unemployment rate.  Reagan strongest in second termReagan (1981-1989) ranks just after Kennedy, his success highlighted by his halving of the inflation rate. Veronique de Rugy, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, says the key to Reagan's record was urging spending cuts to finance tax cuts and an increase in defense spending. "This is the only instance where we see this type of behavior where we have a president who understands you can't have it all," she says. Reagan's first term, marred by a nasty recession, was not stellar, despite a sharp reduction in inflation caused by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's dramatic shift in monetary policy, which started under Carter. Reagan's second term, though, was very strong.The Ford and Carter years (1974-1981) are widely recalled as a time of economic disaster. But by the numbers they were middling, not awful. Most surprising is that Carter ranks first in job creation as 10 million jobs were added during his four years in office, more on an annualized basis than Clinton or Reagan. But because the labor force was expanding at the same time, led by an increasing number of women working outside the home, the rate of unemployment barely budged. Gerald R. Ford ranks first for controlling inflation, cutting 3.4 percent off the rate during his brief two-and-a-half-year term.The situation got much worse under Carter, in large part because of the oil embargo imposed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and resultant price shocks. But Carter appointed Volcker, whose monetary policies at the Fed eventually stemmed the inflationary tide.Of the ten postwar presidents, the first President Bush brings up the rear. He ranks dead last for both GDP growth and income growth and also ballooned the deficit at a rate faster than every president but Ford. His one modest success was continuing the dramatic drop in inflation that had started under Reagan. LaSalle's Schubert notes that Bush had "some bad luck," in that the post-Gulf War recovery was too late and too tepid to aid his reelection prospects. But Schubert faults Bush for a lack of perceptible economic policy of any kind, good or bad.  © 2004 Forbes.com

						    urlLink article found here    Friday July 23, 2004 7:16 AM  By DOUGLASS K. DANIEL  Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Republican National Committee has asked Bush-backing Roman Catholics to provide copies of their parish directories to help register Catholics to vote in the November election, a use of personal information not necessarily condoned by dioceses around the country.  In a story posted Thursday on its Web site, the National Catholic Reporter said a GOP official had urged people who attended a Catholic outreach event in January to provide parish directories and membership lists to the political party.  ``Access to these directories is critical as it allows us to identify and contact those Catholics who are likely to be supportive of President Bush's compassionate conservative agenda,'' wrote Martin J. Gillespie, director of Catholic Outreach at the RNC. ``Please forward any directories you are able to collect to my attention.''  The RNC is using the information from parish directories only for its nonpartisan voter registration drive, RNC spokeswoman Christine Iverson told The Associated Press on Thursday. Those efforts target members of other faiths as well as people who belong to nonreligious organizations, she said.  Parish directories often contain personal information about church members, including names of family members, home addresses and phone numbers. Iverson said she did not know if the GOP had sought similar directories from other religious organizations or how many Catholic directories it received in response to Gillespie's request.  Susan Gibbs, the spokeswoman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., which oversees 140 parishes in Washington and Maryland, said parish directories publish information only for use among church members and not for use by outside organizations no matter what their purpose.  ``Parish directories are for helping parishioners get to know each other better and are strictly for that purpose. They are not intended to be used for any outside commercial purpose, solicitations or anything else,'' Gibbs said. ``Parish directories or priest directories are not given to outside groups even if it's for a good cause.''  Catholic parishioners provided that personal information with an expectation of what it would be used for, said Rebecca Summers of the office of communications for the Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Mo., which has more than 90 parishes.  ``I'm not certain under any scenario that we would encourage someone responding to that appeal - for any purpose, whether it would be an environmental cause or any purpose other than what the people volunteered the information for,'' Summers told the AP.  The Catholic Church has its own nonpartisan voter registration initiatives and candidate forums, Gibbs said.    Once again the GOP is trying to endanger a church's IRS tax-exempt status by getting the directories of the parishioners for recruitment in violation of existing laws. They don't care if they cause all of the conservative churches in America to lose their tax-exempt status if it gets their boys elected.  Compassionate Conservatism MY ASS!!!!!

						   A TvNewsLIES Reader contribution.By John Gray Cincinnati, Ohio -&nbsp;  urlLink jgray7@cinci.rr.com  - July - 2004  Printable version:  urlLink Click here!   Joe gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee. He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water because some liberal fought for minimum water quality standards. He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because some liberal fought to insure their safety and work as advertised.  All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his employers medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs this day. Joe’s bacon is safe to eat because some liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.  Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo; His bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because some liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree hugging liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see, some liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.  Joe begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay, medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joe’s employer pays these standards because Joe’s employer doesn’t want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed he’ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some liberal didn’t think he should loose his home because of his temporary misfortune.  Its noon time, Joe needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe’s deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some liberal wanted to protect Joe’s money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression.  Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his below market federal student loan because some stupid liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his life-time.  Joe is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive to dads; his car is among the safest in the world because some liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration because bankers didn’t want to make rural loans. The house didn’t have electric until some big government liberal stuck his nose where it didn’t belong and demanded rural electrification. (Those rural Republican’s would still be sitting in the dark)  He is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives on Social Security and his union pension because some liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn’t have to. After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home.He turns on a radio talk show, the host’s keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. (He doesn’t tell Joe that his beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day)&nbsp; Joe agrees, “We don’t need those big government liberals ruining our lives; after all, I’m a self made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have”.

						   Disturbing news from this  urlLink article &nbsp;by a Pulitzer Prize-winning national correspondent. It tells how Billions of Taxpayer Dollars are being spent in Iraq with no accounting oversight. The Bush Administration is refusing to produce documentation to the accounting firm KMPG's auditors or the United Nations&nbsp; or the International Monetary Fund trying to determine how these Billions of Dollars are being spent. Very disturbing indeed. In addition more No-Bid contracts are being awarded to Bush Cronies for lucrative reconstruction contracts despite the furor over the many Haliburton scandals. Does this Administration have no Shame? The article is carried by one of the few remaining US Locally Owned Newspapers not controlled by Huge Media Corporations. The TV, radio, and newspapers controlled by Media Moguls are keeping mum about this and other rip-offs of the American people and the Iraqi people. It is utterly disgusting!

						    urlLink Oklahoma Hopeful for GOP Senate Nomination (and a Former Congressman) Says, "I favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life." Although , he admits that he performed two abortions to save the lives of mothers who had congenital heart disease. Interesting Pro-Life stance. Currently under the law doctors are permitted to perform abortions as Dr. Coburn&nbsp;himself did, but he wants them to be executed for this. Is this all that different from the Domestic Terrorists who blow up abortion clinics or kill doctors who perform abortions? I am Pro-Life, but unlike many who claim to be Pro-Life, I am truly Pro-Life. I don't support the death penalty or lying to the American people and the Congress in order to start a war in which tens of thousands of people are killed, and ten times that many severely wounded. In my own state of Illinois many death row inmates were found to be innocent of the crimes they were convicted of (the former Governor had to suspend the death penalty in Illinois because of this). This is true in many states. Is this not murder? How can someone be Pro-Murder and claim to be Pro-Life? It doesn't make any sense! I admire Dr. Coburn's stand on allowing lower cost Canadian drugs to enter the US and break the lock US Pharmaceutical Corporations have on the American market, but his desire to see abortion doctors killed for what he himself had done, and what the law currently allows boggles the mind.

						   For years now Bush supporters have claimed that anyone who opposed or criticized the Bush Administration’s policy on Iraq were unpatriotic, un-American, and not supporting the troops. I have been critical of the Bush Administration’s Iraq policy since 2002 when it became obvious that they intended to invade despite the falseness of their reasoning. When the war began I began contributing blood to a blood bank that supplied blood to our troops throughout the world. I sent emails to every member of the military I could find to let them know that we, the American people, appreciate their sacrifice for us and support them even if we disagree with decisions that the President makes. I began writing letters to newspapers that many if not most of us who opposed the war in Iraq were eternally grateful to all service members who put themselves in harms way for our protection and freedom.  Only one newspaper printed my letter to the editor, The Stars & Stripes, the official newspaper to the US Military. All other US newspapers I contacted refused to print my letter. Every one but Stars & Stripes.  The other newspapers, TV and radio continued telling the lie that all those who opposed or criticized the Bush Administration’s policy on Iraq were unpatriotic, un-American, and not supporting the troops. The lie was told so often and without opposition that nearly everyone believed it.  One Bush supporter named Frances Shannon recently sent a letter to the editor of a paper calling those who criticize Bush or oppose the Iraq War as unpatriotic wimps. A Viet Nam veteran wounded three times during the Viet Nam war who opposed the Iraq war and criticized Bush responded with this great letter to the editor.  This is a must read.     urlLink You Calling Me An Unpatriotic Wimp?   Date: Jul 11, 2004 - 08:25 PM   When Americans opposed to Bush are called unpatriotic wimps, a disabled veteran in a wheelchair goes on the attack.  By Jack Dalton  To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, right or wrong, is not only un-patriotic, but it is morally treasonable to the American people. --President Theodore Roosevelt   In the small Texas town of Canyon Lake, a sea of Bush ideologues, there is a stong voice of reason: Doug Kirk, the much attacked publisher of the Canyon Lake Weekly. Recently, a letter to the editor from Frances Shannon went too far. Way too far.   “It is people like you who cry anti-war slogans, criticize our commander-in-chief for liberating Iraq and Afghanistan from barbarian rule that I was referring to as wimps,” she wrote. Besides Doug, she also included in the “wimps with no backbone that do not deserve to be called Americans” category, “wives, mothers, and others that complain.”   This rated more than a simple letter to the editor response.  For your information, Frances Shannon, when you were at home baking cookies, I and thousands of other “wimps with no backbone” were crawling around in Vietnam. While some at home were being “patriotic” and proudly waving the American flag with self-righteousness and vociferously supporting that un-mitigated disaster, as is being done today with Iraq, I and thousands of other Americans were getting shot to hell and back, as is happening in Iraq today.   Thirty-five years later, after all the pontificating about “never again” has faded from memory, that same flag of false and misguided patriotism once again “proudly” waves over America. It seems that never again is here again (if it ever went away).  The ease at which those of you who so blindly follow Bush can label fellow citizens as “wimps without backbone that do not deserve to be called Americans,” including those of us who are combat veterans, concerns me in some ways more than my serious concerns for George Bush. Having been decorated for counter-insurgency operations in 1966, having been three times wounded and living a life fighting the effects of Agent Orange, I am not a wimp.  By your statements, one can only conclude that you believe the only patriotic Americans are those that toot the horn for George Bush. I guess it makes no difference to you that the man you support has cut and is cutting funding for the Veterans Administration which to date has forced over 250,000 veterans out of the system due to a lack of funding. At the same time, this same man is creating more veterans and more disabled veterans.  If continuing my open opposition to the Bush cabal makes me a “wimp without backbone,” I guess I’ll be a wimp without backbone for whatever life I have remaining. For I will go to my grave in opposition to any and all who preach perpetual war for profit.  The thing that really stands out is that the vast majority of those who feel free to label their fellow citizens as un-patriotic, un-American, traitors, wimps, etc., especially those of us who actually wore the uniform and went to war, is that they themselves, for whatever reason, never wore this country’s uniform and never went to war. The arrogance of people to call anyone, let alone combat veterans, wimps and un-American is astounding!  My right to criticize was born in the thick of war. Your right to criticize was born in your front rooms from watching 30-second sound bites on Fox “news.” My right is carried by sacrifice, yours by privilege.   A Free Iraq?   As for the statement Iraq is liberated and the Iraqi people are now free, it would be laughable if it were not so very sad. Sure the Iraqi people are now free, free to be a part of the 60% unemployed and free to watch Halliburton import thousands of foreign laborers to “rebuild” Iraq. Free to watch the wholesale privatization of their nation’s resources, infrastructure, economy and everything in between by the same U.S. multinationals importing labor. But the Iraqi people have been liberated.  They are now free to see their fellow citizens subject to arrest, detention, torture, and murder in the same prisons that Saddam used for the very same purposes. But they have been liberated and they are now free. They are now free to watch their country turned into what it never was until the politically driven and ideology based invasion: ground zero for fools and fanatics. But Iraq has been liberated and the Iraqi people are now free.  They are free to wonder, with all the money Halliburton has been paid, when they will have potable water and electricity more than 8 hours a day; they are free to wonder about this and much more. They are free to wonder why Americans pay no attention to their own General Accounting Office reports that clearly state Iraq is worse off than before the invasion. (GAO report, 6/2004: “Iraq is Worse off Than Before the War Began”)  I could go on for a long time enumerating the theft of Iraq, but time and space prevent that. Be that as it may, one last thought on the “liberation” of Iraq: For those willing to use the brain’s memory cells, you will recall that in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, not one time was “liberating Iraq” part of the discussion. From the beginning, it was weapons of mass destruction, mushroom clouds over Manhattan, and the link between Saddam, bin Laden, and al Qaeda, all of which has proven to be false and deliberately so! It was when those “reasons” began to unravel that Bush’s adventure morphed in to a war of “liberation.” This was deliberate deception, just like with Vietnam.  I for one am really tired of Bush and company pissin’ on my boots while trying to convince me it’s raining. The crazy part is how many of you are reaching for umbrellas.

						   I am a Pro-Life Catholic, but the behavior of some leaders of the Catholic Church to focus only on the issue of abortion and ignore all other teachings of the Catholic Church in order to tilt the election toward the Republican Party is disgraceful! I learned that the Conservative Newspaper, The Washington Times, reported that a study showed that Kerry voted in support of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' (USCCB) positions on issues than other senators, and that Democratic Catholic senators voted in support of the USCCB positions more often than their Catholic Republican counterparts did. Read the  urlLink article  which I have included below:  Report says Kerry votes with Catholics By Amy Fagan THE WASHINGTON TIMES Published June 3, 2004  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry votes more in line with Catholic teachings than his Catholic colleagues, says a survey of votes by one Democratic senator.      Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois released a report compiled by his office staff that found when issues other than the church's pro-life stance are taken into account, Catholic Democratic senators voted more in line with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' (USCCB) positions than their Catholic Republican counterparts did.      Mr. Durbin, a Catholic who has been criticized by a monsignor in his hometown for voting to support abortion rights, hopes his report will show that "there is more than one issue associated with Catholic teaching."      Mr. Kerry had an overall score of 60.9 percent when rated on domestic issues, international issues and pro-life issues. That was tops among the 24 Catholic senators. Overall, Mr. Durbin's report found Catholic Senate Democrats scored 54 percent, and their Catholic Republican colleagues scored 43 percent.      But Sen. Rick Santorum, a Pennsylvania Republican and a Catholic who scored 40.8 percent overall, said Mr. Durbin is "trying to put a political spin that all of these issues have moral equivalency, and that's simply not the case."      He said the Catholic Church places higher moral importance on pro-life issues than it does on other issues Mr. Durbin rated, so, "any attempt to give the two equal weight is just an attempt to confuse."      USCCB spokesman Bill Ryan referred voters to a document his group compiled on Catholics and political responsibility, but did not want to comment further.      On pro-life issues, Catholic Republicans matched the bishops' positions 72 percent of the time, compared with the Democrats' 12 percent. However, Democrats did better on domestic issues, such as favoring gun control and increasing the minimum wage, scoring 79 percent, while Republicans scored 34 percent.      Mr. Durbin's aides began by examining 101 issues laid out by the USCCB in its legislative report for the first session of the 108th Congress. They also combed the conference Web site to find other alerts and letters in which the conference staked out a position on an issue before Congress. The aides boiled that down to 24 issues, which most of the report was based on.      But on some topics, such as immigration and the death penalty, the report gave credit when senators' sponsored bills the conference had endorsed, even if those bills have not yet received a Senate vote.      Still, Mr. Durbin chose not to count senators' support for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex "marriage," which the conference endorsed last fall, but has not yet received a vote, or senators' support for school vouchers.      Monsignor Kevin Vann has said he would not serve Communion to Mr. Durbin because of his pro-choice voting record, the Illinois State-Journal Register reported in April.

						    urlLink The White House has demanded that Kerry apologize for Whoopi Goldberg using filthy language in a stand-up routine that she wouldn't let Team Kerry in on prior to her act.  Keep in mind that Vice President Cheney only last week told a Senator to go F*CK himself on the Senate Floor when that senator brought up the Haliburton no-bid contracts they got in Iraq. Cheney didn't apologize, and said that the senator had it coming to him on the Senate Floor no less.   This is typical of the Grand Old Hypocrisy Party that screamed bloody murder because a private citizen submitted an entry into MoveOn.com’s contest for a 2 minute ad on Bush that contained a picture of Hitler. MoveOn received thousands of these entries, and it didn’t even include the Hitler ad in its finalists. The Bush/Cheney team is airing an anti-Kerry ad with – you guesed it – Hitler in the ad. This is the same people who in the 2002 election morphed a Viet Nam war hero who lost 3 limbs into Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Typical GOP BS! These sub-human scumbags disgust me.

						   I saw this anonymous post on a forum regarding the news that Bush's National Guard records during the time in question were accidentally destroyed.  It is very tough to be a Republican in 2004, because somehow, you have to believe concurrently that:  1) Jesus loves you, but shares your deep hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton  2) The United Stated should get out of the United Nations, but our highest national priority is enforcing UN resolutions against Iraq.  3) Standing tall for America means firing all of your workers and moving their jobs to India.  4) A woman can not be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational corporations can make decisions affecting all of mankind.  5) Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you are a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for recovery.  6) The best way to improve military moral is to praise troops in speeches, while slashing veterans’ benefits and combat pay.  7) Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins, unless someday you run for Governor of California as a Republican.  8) If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents wont have sex.  9) A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle out long time allies and then demand their cooperation and money.  10) HMO's and insurance companies make huge profits and have the interest of the public at heart.  11) Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.  12) Global warming and tobacco’s link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.  13) It's ok that the Bush family's Carlisle Group has done millions of$$ in business with the Bin Laden Family.  14) Saddam was a good guy when Regan armed him and Rumsfeld reassured him he was our buddy, but a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, but then a bad guy again when Son of a Bush needed a prop for his reelection campaign as the war President.  15) A president lying about extramarital affairs is an impeachable offence. A president lying about WMD existence to enlist support for an unprovoked, undeclared war and occupation, in which thousand of soldiers and civilians die, is, somehow, solid defense policy in a War against Terrorism.  16) Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which should include banning Gay marriages and censoring the internet.  17) The public has a right to know about Hiller's cattle trades, but George Bush's Harkin Oil stock trade should be sealed in his daddy's library, and none of our business.  18) What Bill Clinton and John Kerry did in the 80's is of vital national interest, but what son of a bush did in the 80's is irrelevant.  19) Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to the spirit of international harmony.  20) Affirmative Action is wrong, but it is ok for you daddy and his friends (here and in Saudi Arabia) to get you to graduate from Yale without studding much, to bail out your companies (Harkin Oil and the Texas Rangers), and to get the Governorship of Texas.  21) You are a conservative, but it is OK to spend like there is no tomorrow and run up deficits that your grandchildren will have to repay, while at the same time refunding as much tax money as possible to the rich people who by their own admission do not need or want it.   Contemplating these illogical paradoxes can take a toll on a healthy mind. So if a friend of yours has been acting a bit dazed and confused lately, be nice; he or she may be a republican.

						    urlLink Cheney Had No New Data on Saddam, Al Qaeda-Panel says Republican led panel   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Sept. 11 commission, which reported no evidence of collaborative links between Iraq and al Qaeda, said on Tuesday that Vice President Dick Cheney had no more information than commission investigators to support his later assertions to the contrary.   The 10-member bipartisan panel investigating the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington said it reached its conclusion after reviewing available transcripts of Cheney's public remarks on the subject.   The vice president has asserted long-standing links between the former Iraqi president and Osama Bin Laden's Islamist militant network.   "The 9-11 Commission believes it has access to the same information the vice president has seen regarding contacts between al Qaeda and Iraq prior to the 9-11 attacks," the commission said in a statement.   Assertions that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and could be prepared to provide chemical or biological agents to al Qaeda for attacks on the United States were a main justification for Bush's decision to invade and occupy Iraq.   No such weapons have been found, and recent opinion polls have suggested growing public skepticism about the Bush administration's reasons for launching a war in which 870 U.S. soldiers have died and nearly 5,400 have been wounded in combat and over 11,000 in non-combat injuries.   The commission called White House claims about links between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda into question on June 11 with a staff report that found no evidence of a collaborative relationship between the Iraqi leader and al Qaeda before the day of the attacks.   But Bush and his top aides stood firm, with Cheney forcefully maintaining that evidence depicting an Iraqi role in the Sept. 11 attacks may yet emerge.   "The notion that there is no relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda just simply is not true," the vice president said in an interview with CNBC.   The New York Times later reported that Kean and Hamilton hoped to see any additional information Cheney had on the subject.    As part of the White House reaction to the Sept. 11 commission's report, national security adviser Condoleezza Rice who said she believed the panel was actually denying that Saddam had control over al Qaeda. Kean and Hamilton flatly rejected her interpretation.

						   The Bush/Cheney Campaign has been urging Christian churches to campaign for their candidates using the churches to promote Bush for President. This is endangering those churches' tax exempt status because IRS law prohibits tax exempt organizations from actively participating in political campaigns. As a Christian I must think about what Jesus would say about all this. This is not only a violation of law, but also a violation of Christ's teachings:  When Jesus asked if it was right to pay taxes, he asked whose likeness was on the money. In that case it was Caesar's. Jesus responded "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, but render unto God what is God's." Whose likeness is on our money? Presidents of US and other famous US Government people like Franklin, Hamilton and Chase. That is true of the money that is in the hands of Christian churches as well. Shouldn't they follow Jesus' command to render unto the US Government what is the Us Government's, but render unto God what is God's (such as their time and efforts when they are in church)?  I am not saying that church members should give up being active members of our nation, and participating in political activities, but it sounds to me that Jesus wanted church time to be spent worshiping God, and not Bush. When Jesus found people engaging in non-religious activities in the Temple (those buying and selling animals for sacrifice), he overturned the tables, and threw them out. Damning them for turning the House of God into a Den of Thieves.   Some ask, "Who would Jesus vote for?" I would say that while in the House of God, Jesus wouldn't vote for or campaign for anyone. He would insist that time and energy spent in God's House be devoted solely to God, and God alone. Outside the church is another matter, but churches and congregations should not be used as campaign tools. If leaders of Christian churches can't understand that, then they don't seem to be following the commandments of Jesus, and isn't that what Christians are supposed to do?  Jesus also said that we will know someone by the fruit that they bear (meaning by their actions). A fig tree will bear figs. A thorn bush will not. "By their fruit you will know them," Jesus said. Look at the fruit of church leaders and members who while in the House of God, work not to praise God, but to re-elect a man, Bush. Look at the fruit of the man, Bush, who entices them to spend their time and efforts while in church to re-elect him rather than to give honor and glory to God. Look at these fruits, and follow Jesus' teachings to determine if these people are following Jesus. The answer will be obvious.

						   I am a Roman Catholic who attended Catholic school and learned from Dominican Sisters here in Illinois. So that is the basis of my claim to have some level of knowledge on this topic. As I understand it the whole rationale behind Roman Catholic Church leaders calling for withholding of Holy Communion from Catholic politicians who do not publicly oppose abortion or who support abortion rights in their duty as elected officials boils down to the fact that Catholics are not to receive communion when they are in a state of Mortal Sin. Being in a state of Venial Sin is okay. In fact communion will remove Venial Sin, but not Mortal Sin. So what is a Mortal Sin? A Mortal Sin is defined as a grievous offense which is committed after sufficient reflection and with full consent of the will. Three conditions. Abortion is according to the Catholic Church Murder. The politician him or herself is not the one performing the abortion, but rather offering support for laws which guarantee the right to have an abortion by other people. An argument can be made that offering support for laws guaranteeing the right to have an abortion is aiding and abetting a murder. So I will give the Church leaders that. We can argue that Politicians from the viewpoint of the Catholic Church have committed a grievous offense. So that condition is satisfied. Now can we or the clergy distributing communion determine if the politician in question has sufficiently reflected on what committing that offense has done to the politician’s relationship to God? Certainly not. Furthermore we cannot know if the politician felt compelled to offer support for these laws if the politician felt that he or she was representing a constituency who supported those laws. Also most elected officials take an oath of office (often on a Bible) that they will follow the laws of the land which currently includes that abortion is legal and women have the right to have an abortion. Even if a clergy member knew for a fact that a politician had sufficiently reflected on a grievous offense, and committed it with full consent of the will. That clergy member would not know if the politician had confessed the sin and made a good act of contrition thereby removing the sin from his or her soul. Therefore, a clergy member cannot know the State of Grace of a politician in order to determine whether to withhold Holy Communion. For decades it has been case that Roman Catholic clergy left to the conscience of the communicant the duty of examining his or her soul to determine whether they had a Mortal Sin on their soul. This recent decision is a departure from that, and a dangerous one at that. Who gave these Bishops and Cardinals the psychic ability to look into the souls of communicants to determine their State of Grace? No one. And the Bishops and Cardinals must know this since so few of them have called for the withholding of communion from politicians or as the mind reader in Colorado, Bishop Sheridan proposes withholding communion from lay people who have voted for a politician supportive of abortion rights. This combined with the  urlLink  earlier point  that these Church leaders are ignoring a host of other teachings of the Catholic Church that other politicians violate is cherry picking and an obvious politicizing of the Sacrament of Holy Communion! The vast majority of Catholic Clergy have not called for refusing communion to certain politicians based on their political stances on this one issue. Those clergy who have are using their vaulted positions within the Catholic Church to further their political goals of electing certain politicians at the expense of others. This I believe is reprehensibly shameful. I as a Pro-Life Roman Catholic am mortified and ashamed that members of the Catholic Clergy would behave in such a contemptuous manner and bring such dishonor to the Catholic Church on the heels of the Sex Scandals which have already reduced called into question the honor of the clergy. Are these few Right-Wing Political Pundits in priestly cassocks  TRYING  to undermine the Catholic Church in the United States? It would almost appear so!

						    urlLink The Story Online    Last week in Illinois the Republican U.S. Senate candidate, Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race after his divorce records revealed that he had taken his now ex-wife to kinky sex clubs. He admitted that he had taken her to one such club in Paris, and that was enough to do him in. A few days later he exited the race.   The class-act story here is Barack Obama, Ryan's Democratic opponent. A rising star in the Democratic Party, Obama responded to news of his opponent's sexcapades by saying, "I don't really care about private morality, I'm more concerned with public morality."   In that statement lies the root of the great cultural divide between hard-core Democrats and religious Republicans.   Democrats are outraged over the public immorality of George W. Bush and his administration -- its justifications, denials and lies about everything from corporate complicity to the reasons for invading Iraq.   Republicans seem far more consumed by private morality -- gays who seek the "normalcy" of marriage, women who confront the difficult choice to end a pregnancy, and, paradoxically, the sex life of their own Jack Ryan.   Bringing both groups to a full boil are the side-by-side releases of Bill Clinton's autobiography, "My Life," and Michael Moore's contentious blockbuster film, "Fahrenheit 9/11."   With Bill Clinton making the chat-show rounds we once again visit the lapse in his personal morality that imploded his otherwise extraordinary presidency. Out of 957 pages about a complicated and brilliant man, the press has fixated on those dealing with Monica Lewinsky. "I did it because I could," says a barely penitent Clinton of his infamous dalliance, and half the nation gags while the other half stifles a yawn.   But it's George Bush's lack of public morality that's on display in "Fahrenheit 9/11." We see him profiting from his family's old and oily ties to the Bin Laden family and from his cozy cheek-to-cheek relationship with his father's corporate cronies. In one clip from the film Bush is seen at an elegant white-tie fundraiser smugly joking, "Some people call you the elite; I call you my base."   More disturbing is the footage which portrays him as a man lacking the gravitas to understand the cataclysmic consequences of his public actions. He rolls his eyes and mugs for the camera as the clock ticks down to his televised announcement that he has ordered the bombing of Iraq. He comes across not as a man wrestling with the morality of his decision, but as a man blowing up a foreign country, because he can.   Predictably the film has roiled the fair and balanced sensibilities of Bush's right-wing claque.   The conservative Citizens United, which played a leading role in pressuring CBS to pull its Reagan docudrama off the air last fall, has filed suit with the Federal Elections Commission alleging that ads for the film are political and should not be allowed to air on TV. Other pro-Bushies have called for boycotts of theaters which run the film and denounced Moore as an "America hater."   David Brooks, the New York Times columnist who writes with a well-crafted right-wing slant, excoriated not only Michael Moore, but American liberals for what he calls their adulation of Moore. "The standards of socially acceptable liberal opinion have shifted," he writes. "We're a long way from John Dewey." Well, yes, and a long way from Dewey's Republican contemporary, President Teddy Roosevelt, for that matter, who once said, "Public rights come first; public interest second."   Brooks et al. don't have a leg to stand on when the best-known media standard bearer of conservative opinion is Rush Limbaugh, no slacker himself in the private immorality sweepstakes, with a cadre of lying radio jackals yipping along behind him.   Bill Clinton's personal immorality distracted a nation and hurt him and his family terribly, but he presided over a bountiful eight years, eliminated the national debt and honed America's image abroad to a sparkling finish, at least in the eyes of all but the most rabid fundamentalists like the Taliban and Osama bin Laden. Back then, most people wanted to be like us.   George Bush may have a very tidy private life, but his public immorality has squandered billions of dollars as well as world opinion and prestige. It has saddled our children's futures with billowing debt, sold the nation's environment to the highest bidder and compromised its health to appease the religious right.   And it has resulted in the deaths of over 850 Americans and thousands of Iraqis, leaving broken and anguished families in both countries, with an unclear plan, at best, for the future. It is this anguish which Moore documents most wrenchingly.   Barack Obama wouldn't have put it this way, but given the stakes, I'm more concerned with the public fool than the private philanderer.

						     Suprise, suprise, suprise! Agency analysts were repeatedly ordered to redo their studies of Al Qaeda ties to Hussein regime, a terrorism expert charges.   urlLink The Story  WASHINGTON — In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, CIA analysts were ordered repeatedly to redo intelligence assessments concluded that Al Qaeda had no operational ties to Iraq, according to a veteran CIA counter-terrorism official who has written a book that is sharply critical of the decision to go to war with Iraq.    Agency analysts never altered their conclusions, but saw the pressure to revisit their work as a clear indication that Bush administration officials were seeking a different answer regarding Iraq and Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the CIA officer said in an interview with The Times.   "We on the Bin Laden side [of the agency's analytic ranks] were required repeatedly to check, double-check and triple-check our files about a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq," said the officer, who spoke on condition that he be identified only by his first name, Mike.   Asked whether he attributed the demands to an eagerness among officials at the White House or the Pentagon to find evidence of a link, he said: "You could not help but assume that was the case. They knew the answer [they wanted] before they asked the question."   The officer is the author of a forthcoming book titled, "Imperial Hubris: Why the West Is Losing the War on Terror," published by Brassey's Inc. of Dulles, Va. He is listed as "Anonymous" on the book, which describes him as a "senior U.S. intelligence official with nearly two decades of experience in national security issues."   The author has held a number of high-ranking agency positions, including serving from 1996 to 1999 as head of a special unit tracking Bin Laden.   The book was approved for publication by the CIA after a four-month review — creating an unusual situation in which one of the secretive agency's senior officers was offering public criticism of administration policies and the prosecution of the war on terrorism.   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow emphasized that the opinions in the book were those of the author, not the agency. He acknowledged that the book's publication was awkward for an agency that sought to be apolitical, but that the CIA found no classified material in it, and therefore allowed its release.   Some have questioned the author's motives, noting that he was removed as head of the Bin Laden unit in 1999 over concerns about his performance. An intelligence official who has worked with the author at the CIA said that he might have been embittered by his removal, but that "people tend to think of him as a straight shooter."   Mike said he was removed from the post because agency leaders "thought I was too myopic, too intense, too aggressive." He declined to elaborate. But he insisted that he did not write the book to settle scores.   "The important thing to me is that we're missing the boat on this issue," he said.   The book has created a stir in intelligence and policymaking circles for its scathing critique of U.S. efforts after the Sept. 11 attacks. In the book, Mike writes that the war in Afghanistan was in many respects a failure because the United States waited nearly a month to launch the invasion — allowing Al Qaeda operatives to flee — and relied heavily on proxy Afghan forces that were not always loyal to the U.S. cause.   The book asserts that invading Iraq has inflamed anti-American sentiment to such a degree that it is minting a new generation of terrorists.   "We have waged two failed half-wars and, in doing so, left Afghanistan and Iraq seething with anti-U.S. sentiment, fertile grounds for the expansion of Al Qaeda and kindred groups," he writes.   In an interview this week, Mike, who has close-cropped hair and a beard, said Monday's transfer of authority to Iraq was likely to do little to curtail insurgent attacks.   "Iraq, with or without a transfer of power, will be a mujahedin magnet as long as whatever government is there is dependent on America's sword," he said, adding that he thought his view was widely shared among counter-terrorism officials at the CIA and other intelligence agencies.   The stealth manner in which sovereignty was transferred this week in Iraq — in a surprise ceremony two days ahead of schedule involving L. Paul Bremer III, the U.S. civilian administrator in Iraq, and the country's interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi — also sent a weak signal, he said.   "From Bin Laden's perspective, we were afraid they were going to attack us and we left like a thief in the night, with Bremer throwing the keys to Allawi," he said. "They can only see this as a victory."   Mike's criticism of the war in Iraq echoes that of other prominent counter-terrorism officials, including former White House aide Richard A. Clarke. But he is the first active CIA official to make the criticism publicly, albeit anonymously. Mike, however, faulted Clarke and others who served in the Clinton administration for failing to mount operations to capture or kill Bin Laden when the CIA had intelligence on his whereabouts.   He said he thought Bin Laden would have been extremely reluctant to enter a collaborative relationship with Hussein, in part because he saw Iraq's military and spying services as inferior, incapable of protecting the security of Al Qaeda plans and operations.   Mike said that because he did not work in the agency's Iraq section, he could not assess the accuracy of claims that analysts were pressured by the White House to tailor their assessments of Iraq's alleged illicit weapons programs to help make the case for war. Despite being forced to redo their work several times, he said, counter-terrorism analysts never altered their conclusion that Iraq was not working with Al Qaeda.   "There was pressure to perform. But to its credit, the intelligence community as a whole said there was nothing" to suggest a collaborative relationship, he said. "The director on down insisted we call it straight."   Mike still serves in the agency's counter-terrorism center, but acknowledges that he has been marginalized. "I get invited to speak" on counter-terrorism at the Defense Department, the FBI and the National Security Agency, he said, "but not within my own building."   He wrote an earlier book, also anonymously, on Bin Laden and Islamic terrorism that was titled, "Through Our Enemies' Eyes."

						    urlLink Reuters Story Online  RAFAH, Gaza Strip (Reuters) - Israeli forces have shot dead a 9-year-old Palestinian boy playing football in a Gaza refugee camp as tanks rolled in to search for tunnels used by militants, witnesses say.  "We were playing soccer when Israeli tanks ... started firing inside the camp and towards us," said Bashir Abu Jlidan, 18, a resident of Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip.  He said Omar Zara'an, 9, fell to the ground bleeding. Doctors at Rafah hospital pronounced the boy dead after trying to revive him on Thursday.  The Israeli army had no immediate comment on the child's death. It said Israeli forces were on a mission in Rafah, which borders Egypt, to root out tunnels militants use to smuggle in weapons or place explosives underneath army positions.  In Jerusalem, the High Court temporarily barred construction of Israel's West Bank barrier south of the city a day after ordering the state to re-route a 30-km (18-mile) section to the northwest to reduce hardship for local Palestinians.  That decision set a precedent for pending hearings on some 20 other Palestinian petitions against sectors of the zigzagging barrier they say cut them off from farms, markets, public services and West Bank cities.  Thursday's High Court injunction responded to a petition by Palestinian villagers trapped by a loop in the disputed barrier around a nearby Jewish settlement on occupied territory.  Israel says the barrier, due to extend over 600 km (370 miles), is meant to keep out suicide bombers. Palestinians call it a ruse to annex land they want for a state since it often dips well inside the West Bank to take in settlements.  VOLATILE GAZA REFUGEE CAMP  Rafah residents said 15 Israeli tanks and other armoured vehicles backed by helicopters rumbled into Rafah's Brazil neighbourhood, firing machineguns.  The army besieged Rafah for six days in May, killing 42 Palestinians and leaving hundreds homeless after militants killed 13 soldiers in a string of ambushes.  In the West Bank, Israeli forces mounted a rare raid into the town of Jericho. The army said it detained 30 wanted Palestinians and found weaponry including rifles and grenades.  Witnesses in the ancient town, which has been largely untouched by nearly four years of Israeli-Palestinian violence, said troops pulled out after blowing up two flats and a house.  "This is a dangerous escalation by Israel," said Palestinian Negotiations Minister Saeb Erekat, a Jericho resident.  Residents of Nablus, also in the West Bank, said troops moved again into its casbah, or old town, closing its entrances and taking over a number of houses in a search for militants.  In northern Gaza, witnesses said Israeli forces moved further into the town of Beit Hanoun, seized on Tuesday a day after rockets fired from the area killed a 3-year-old boy and a man in Sderot in southern Israel.  They were the first in Israel to be killed by a rocket attack from Gaza since a Palestinian revolt began in 2000.  Army bulldozers, clearing areas that could provide cover for rocket squads, razed olive groves and orchards in Beit Hanoun. An Israeli military source said on Wednesday troops could remain there for months to stop militants launching rockets.  Prime Minister Ariel Sharon plans to pull settlers and soldiers out of Gaza by the end of 2005 and vows "extensive action" before and after that to thwart further rocket strikes.

						    ...following the realisation that the two men in its custody were Afghan government officials from Helmand province rather than top Taliban commanders as claimed by it earlier.     urlLink Interesting article   PESHAWAR: The US military in Afghanistan is confronted with an embarrassing situation following the realisation that the two men in its custody were Afghan government officials from Helmand province rather than top Taliban commanders as claimed by it earlier.  On Monday, the US military spokeswoman Master Sergeant Cindy Beam said American special forces captured top enemy commanders Hafiz Abdul Majeed and Mohammad Daud in southern Afghanistan in raids on their compounds pre-dawn Saturday. "We have evidence indicating that they were supplying arms to insurgents, conducting rocket attacks on the military, attacking non-governmental aid organisations helping Afghanistan build a national infrastructure, funding ambushes and trafficking opium," she said in a statement.  "During the mission, the enemy regional leaders surrendered as coalition SOF (Special Operations Forces) surprised the insurgents," she added. However, the US military claim is turning out to be untrue. Officials in Afghanistan’s interior ministry in Kabul were quoted as saying that the captured men weren’t the top Taliban commanders sought by the US and Afghan governments. Government officials in Helmand explained that one of the captured men, Hafiz Abdul Majeed, was the administrator for Naomesh district in the province, while the other man was his military bodyguard, Mohammad Daud. They said Majeed had been an anti-Taliban commander and three of his fighters were injured in a firefight with the Taliban fighters only 20 days ago.  The announcement of Majeed’s capture by the US military had created lot of excitement in the American intelligence and media circles. In fact, it had generated hopes that his arrest would enable the US military to track down the Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar. This wasn’t far-fetched because the real Hafiz Abdul Majeed was very close to Mulla Omar. He was the security chief for Kandahar when the Taliban were in power. After the Taliban’s ouster from power, he became one of the important resistance leaders in southern Afghanistan and was named by Mulla Omar as a member of the 10-member Taliban leadership council. His arrest would have been a huge setback for the Taliban.  The fact that the US military announced Hafiz Abdul Majeed’s capture without cross checking his identity isn’t the first time that the Americans have committed such blunders in Afghanistan. Certain other arrests of anti-US Afghans were also cases of mistaken identity.  Earlier, they printed wrong pictures of Mulla Omar on leaflets announcing monetary reward for his capture. Warplanes have frequently bombed the wrong targets, including wedding parties, passenger buses, graveyards, and convoys of pro-government tribal elders.  Taliban spokesman, Abdul Latif Hakimi, whose claims about battleground successes are often ridiculed by Afghan and US government officials, was vindicated on Tuesday following reports that Hafiz Abdul Majeed had not been captured by the American military. On Monday, he had denied the capture of Hafiz Abdul Majeed while talking to The News from an undisclosed location. He thought the US military could have captured someone else. As it turned it, the US military had apprehended Hafiz Abdul Majeed’s namesake.  Hakimi had said he was unable to place Mohammad Daud. The only Daud that he knew in the Taliban movement was Daud Haideri, who was deputy to Mulla Nasir, the Taliban military commander for Ghazni province. Daud Haideri, according to Hakimi, had not been captured. On both counts, Hakimi was proven right.  The US military spokeswoman had not mentioned the place where the two men were captured. She had vaguely said that they were detained in southern Afghanistan. Afghan sources later said the arrests were made in Girishk, a town sited in south-western Helmand province on the Kandahar-Herat road.  It remains to be seen how the US military is going to handle the situation now that it has emerged that the two men in its custody weren’t top Taliban commanders, Hafiz Abdul Majeed and Daud Haideri. Measures would surely be taken to do some damage control and avoid such an embarrassing situation in future. As for the men in its custody, the US military would have to release them because warlords whether small or big are needed to fight the Taliban and other anti-US forces in Afghanistan.

						    urlLink Online article here   By Ted Bridis Associated Press Writer August 12, 2004  WASHINGTON --The Bush administration has discovered no evidence of imminent plans by terrorists to attack U.S. financial buildings, nearly two weeks after the government issued startling warnings about such possible threats, a White House official said Thursday.  Some documents and computer files seized in al-Qaida raids showing surveillance of U.S. financial buildings had been accessed for unknown purposes this spring, months later than authorities had previously disclosed, the official said.  Officials had said earlier that some files had been reviewed as recently as January. The seized records included surveillance reports of financial buildings in New York, Washington and Newark, N.J., during 2000 and 2001, which prompted dramatic warnings Aug. 1 from the White House about possible threats to those buildings. But nothing in the documents themselves has suggested any attack was planned soon, the officials said.  "I have not seen an indication of an imminent operation," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity with reporters from nearly a dozen news organizations. Investigators are still poring over volumes of the seized information.  The White House homeland security adviser, Frances Fragos Townsend, told "Fox News Sunday" over the weekend that authorities believe discovery of the surveillance has disrupted all or part of al-Qaida's plans to carry out such attacks.  The FBI and local police still haven't determined whether surveillance of the financial buildings was performed by a single person or several people, and the FBI has not yet identified anyone involved in the surveillance, the White House official said Thursday, adding that the detailed reconnaissance indicated "an awful lot of time and energy put into it."  Another administration official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House still would have issued the terror alerts that it did nearly two weeks ago even had it known at the time that the surveillance documents did not point to an imminent operation.  The administration remains deeply concerned about information uncovered separately in the spring suggesting al-Qaida was plotting a major attack inside the United States -- perhaps in August or September -- to disrupt the elections, the first official said.  None of the documents or computer files recovered in the recent raids in Pakistan mentioned any election-related plots, the same official said.  This official said unspecified intelligence indicates al-Qaida's plans for an attack before the election were "more than merely aspirational" but declined to be more specific because it might reveal the information's source. Timing was unclear, the official said, acknowledging that intelligence agencies "wish we had a sense."  Senior U.S. officials -- including Townsend, Attorney General John Ashcroft, FBI Director Robert Mueller and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice -- have expressed similar concerns since March about possible al-Qaida efforts to disrupt the U.S. elections.  Townsend said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation" that she believes the surveillance of the U.S. financial buildings might be related to the election-period threat.  Surprise! The imminent warnings of terrorist attacks to U.S. financial institutions released right at the end of the Democratic National Convention when Kerry might have gotten some positive press coverage and which grabbed the headlines from Kerry's triumph and campaign kickoff weren't imminent after all! What a surprise! NOT! They take THREE YEAR OLD data and tell the US there is an imminent terrorist attack to financial institutions, and then Bush sends his wife and daughters to one of the designated targets, CitiCorp (see story link below)! Obviously the attack wasn't imminent or even remotely likely or he wouldn't have done that. How stupid does the Bush Administration think the people of the US are? Well, since the media doesn't inform them of these obvious abuses of Homeland Security for political purposes their expectation may be valid. Get the word out on this! Bush/Cheney Inc. thinks we're a bunch of morons! Let's show them the door in 2004. Vote Tuesday, November 2, 2004!

						    urlLink Online article here    NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Bush's tax cuts have transferred the federal tax burden from the richest Americans to middle-class families, with one-third of them benefiting people with the top 1 percent of income, according to a government report cited in newspapers on Friday.  The Congressional Budget Office report, to be released Friday, is likely to fuel the debate over the cuts between Bush and his Democratic challenger in November, John Kerry.  The report said the top 1 percent, with incomes averaging $1.2 million per year, will receive an average $78,460 tax cut this year, and have seen their share of the total tax burden fall roughly 2 percentage points to 20.1 percent, according to The New York Times.  In contrast, households in the middle 20 percent, with incomes averaging $57,000 per year, will receive an average cut of only $1,090, the newspaper said, citing the CBO report.  Taxpayers whose incomes range from $51,500 to around $75,600, saw their share of federal tax payments increase, according to CBO figures cited by The Washington Post.  The calculations, requested by congressional Democrats, confirm the long-held view by independent tax analysts that the tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, have heavily favored the wealthiest taxpayers, the Times said.  Bush has said the cuts provided crucial support to the U.S. economy after the Sept. 11 attacks and the three-year decline in U.S. stocks.  But Kerry, who wants to roll back the cuts for households whose incomes top $200,000 per year, has said the cuts did little for the economy, and helped cause the federal budget to swing from a more than $100 billion surplus in 2001 to a projected deficit exceeding $400 billion this year.  The newspapers, citing the CBO report, said about two-thirds of the benefits from the cuts went to households in the top 20 percent, with an average income of $203,740.  People in the lowest 20 percent of earnings, which averaged $16,620, saw their effective tax rate fall to 5.2 percent from 6.7 percent, though their average tax cut was only $250.  Isn't this what all of the knowledgeable tax experts have been saying for 3 years now? It took the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office to corroborate what we've known for 3 years? And still the Bush Admin will deny the truth to continue delivering benefit to those George W. Bush referred to as his "Base" when he attended that black tie and tail fundraiser highlighted in the film Fahrenheit 9/11.

						    Published on Thursday, August 12, 2004 on  urlLink Common Dreams from AFP    WASHINGTON - The Washington Post became the latest prestigious US newspaperto question its own coverage of Iraq leading up to the US-led war,  urlLink saying it underplayed stories questioning White House claims that Saddam Hussein hadweapons of mass destruction. "Administration assertions were on the front page. Things that challengedthe administration were on A18 on Sunday or A24 on Monday," said Pentagoncorrespondent Thomas Ricks.  "There was an attitude among editors: Look, we're going to war, why dowe even worry about all this contrary stuff?" he added.In retrospect, said Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr., "we were sofocused on trying to figure out what the administration was doing that we werenot giving the same play to people who said it wouldn't be a good idea to go towar and were questioning the administration's rationale."Not enough of those stories were put on the front page. That was amistake on my part."  In the months leading up to the March 2003 invasion, there were persistentdoubts about intelligence reports underpinning White House contentions that Iraqposed a threat because it was hiding weapons of mass destruction and had linkswith international terrorist organizations.  No chemical, biological or nuclear weapons have been found in Iraq sincethen, and US investigators have dismissed any serious contacts between SaddamHussein's regime and international terrorists.In the aftermath of the war, the US media in general has been criticized forlacking objectivity in its coverage of the Bush administration's drive to punishBaghdad.  "We did our job, but we didn't do enough, and I blame myself mightilyfor not pushing harder," Assistant Managing Editor Bob Woodward said in aninterview.  "We should have warned readers we had information that the basis for(the war) was shakier" than widely believed, he said. "Those areexactly the kind of statements that should be published on the front page."In May, The New York Times issued a similar critique of its coverage in therun-up to the war, saying administration claims were published with insufficientdoubt.  "Some of the Times's coverage in the months leading up to the invasionof Iraq was credulous; much of it was inappropriately italicized by lavishfront-page display and heavy-breathing headlines," Public Editor DanielOkrent said at the time.  Okrent's column came four days after the Times's editors printed their ownmea culpa, admitting the newspaper was taken in by spurious information fromIraqi exiles -- especially over the issue of weapons of mass destruction -- withtheir own agenda to oust Saddam Hussein.Okrent cited instances in which reporters who raised substantive questionsabout certain stories were not heeded, while others with substantial knowledgeof the subject at hand seemed not to have been given the chance to expressreservations.   "Times reporters broke many stories before and after the war -- but whenthe stories themselves later broke apart, in many instances Times readers neverfound out," he said. "Some remain scoops to this day. This is not acompliment."

						    urlLink Online article here  						 August 6, 2004 						 Modified:August 10, 2004 			 						 Summary     A group funded by the biggest Republican campaign donor in Texas began running an attack ad Aug. 5 in which former Swift Boat veterans claim Kerry lied to get one of his two decorations for bravery and two of his three purple hearts.  But the veterans who accuse Kerry are contradicted by Kerry's former crewmen. One of the accusers says he was on another boat "a few yards" away during the incident which won Kerry the Bronze Star, but the former Army lieutenant whom Kerry plucked from the water that day backs Kerry's account. In an Aug. 10 opinion piece in the conservative  Wall Street Journal  , Rassmann (a Republican himself) wrote that the ad was "launched by people without decency" who are "lying" and "should hang their heads in shame."  						 Analysis     "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" is a group formed March 23&#160;after&#160;Kerry wrapped up the Democratic nomination. It held a news conference May 4 denigrating Kerry's military record and his later anti-war pronouncements during the 1970's. The group&#160;began running&#160;an attack ad Aug. 5 in which 13 veterans variously&#160;say Kerry&#160;is "not being honest" and "is lying about his record."              SBVT Ad "Any Questions?"  &#160;     John Edwards : "If you have any questions about what John Kerry is made of, just spend 3 minutes with the men who served with him."      (On screen: Here's what those men this of John Kerry)       Al French : I served with John Kerry.      Bob Elder  : I served with John Kerry.      George Elliott:  John Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam.      Al French:  He is lying about his record.      Louis Letson : I know John Kerry is lying about his first Purple Heart because I treated him for that injury.      Van O'Dell : John Kerry lied to get his bronze star...I know, I was there, I saw what happened.      Jack Chenoweth : His account of what happened and what actually happened are the difference between night and day.      Admiral Hoffman : John Kerry has not been honest.      Adrian Lonsdale : And he lacks the capacity to lead.      Larry Thurlow : When he chips were down, you could not count on John Kerry.      Bob Elder : John Kerry is no war hero.      Grant Hibbard : He betrayed all his shipmates...he lied before the Senate.      Shelton White : John Kerry betrayed the men and women he served with in Vietnam.      Joe Ponder : He dishonored his country...he most certainly did.      Bob Hildreth : I served with John Kerry...      Bob Hildreth (off camera)  : John Kerry cannot be trusted.             Where the Money Comes From     Although the word "Republican" does not appear in the ad, the&#160;group's financing is highly partisan. The source of the Swift Boat group's money wasn't known when it first surfaced, but a report filed July 15 with the Internal Revenue Services now shows its  initial funding came mainly from a Houston home builder, Bob R. Perry, who has also given millions to the Republican party  and Republican candidates, mostly in Texas, including President Bush and Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, whose district is near Houston     Perry gave $100,000 of the $158,750 received by the Swift Boat group through the end of June, according to its disclosure  urlLink report  .     Perry and his wife Doylene also gave more than $3 million to Texas Republicans during the 2002 elections, according to a database maintained by the&#160; urlLink Institute on Money in State Politics  . The Perrys also were among the largest Republican donors in neighboring Louisiana, where they gave $200,000, and New Mexico, where they gave $183,000, according to the&#160;database&#160;     At the federal level the Perrys&#160;have given $359,825 since 1999, including $6,000 to Bush's campaigns and $27,325 to DeLay and his political action committee, Americans for a Republican Majority, according the a database maintained by the  urlLink Center for Responsive Politics  .     The Silver Star     Several of those who appear in the ad have signed brief affidavits, and we have posted some of them in the "supporting documents" section to the right for our visitors to evaluate for themselves.  One of those affidavits, signed by George Elliott, quickly became controversial. Elliott is the retired Navy captain who had recommended Kerry for his highest decoration for valor, the Silver Star, which was awarded for events of Feb. 29, 1969, when&#160;Kerry beached his boat in the face of an enemy ambush and then pursued and killed an enemy soldier on the shore.  Elliott, who had been Kerry's commanding officer, was quoted by the  Boston Globe &#160;Aug 6 as saying he had made a "terrible mistake" in signing the affidavit against Kerry, in which Elliott suggested Kerry hadn't told him the truth about how he killed the enemy soldier. Later Elliott signed a second affidavit saying he still stands by the words in the TV ad. But Elliott also made what he called an "immaterial clarification" - saying he has no first-hand information that Kerry was less than forthright about what he did to win the Silver Star.  What Elliott said in the ad is that Kerry "has not been honest about what happened in Viet Nam." In his original affidavit Elliott said Kerry had not been "forthright" in Vietnam. The only example he offered of Kerry not being "honest" or "forthright" was this: "For example, in connection with his Silver Star, I was never informed that he had simply shot a wounded, fleeing Viet Cong in the back."     In the  Globe &#160;story, Elliott is quoted as saying it was a "terrible mistake" to sign that statement:        George Elliott ( Globe &#160;account): &#160;It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here. . . .  I knew it was wrong  . . . In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake.       In his  second &#160;affidavit, however, Elliott downgraded that "terrible mistake" to an "immaterial clarification." He said in the second affidavit:        Elliott (second affidavit): &#160; I do not claim to have personal knowledge &#160;as to how Kerry shot the wounded, fleeing Viet Cong.&#160;       Elliott also said he now believes Kerry shot the man in the back, based on other accounts including a book in which Kerry is quoted as saying of the soldier, "He was running away with a live B-40 (rocket launcher) and, I thought, poised to turn around and fire it." (The book quoted by Elliott is  John&#160; F. Kerry, The Complete Biography, By The Reporters Who Know Him Best .)     Elliott also says in that second affidavit, "Had I known the facts, I would not have recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for simply pursuing and dispatching a single, wounded, fleeing Viet Cong." That statement is misleading, however. It mischaracterizes the actual basis on which Kerry received his decoration.      The&#160; urlLink official citation  shows Kerry was  not &#160;awarded the Silver Star "for simply pursing and dispatching" the Viet Cong. In fact, the killing is not even mentioned in the official citation.  The citation - based on what Elliott wrote up at the time - covers Kerry's decision to attack rather than flee from  two  ambushes, including one in which he "led a landing party." It says Kerry first attacked an "entrenched enemy" less than 50 feet away: "Unhesitatingly, Lieutenant (junior grade) Kerry ordered his boat to attack as all units opened fire and beached directly in front of the enemy ambushers. This daring and courageous tactic surprised the enemy and succeeded in routing a score of enemy soldiers." It says "many enemy weapons" were captured. Later, 800 yards away, Kerry's boat encountered a  second  ambush and a B-40 rocket exploded&#160; "close aboard" Kerry's boat. "With utter disregard for his own safety, and the enemy rockets, he again ordered a charge on the enemy, beached his boat only ten feet away from the VC rocket position, and personally led a landing party ashore in pursuit of the enemy." There is no mention of enemy casualties at all.  Kerry was cited for "extraordinary daring and personal courage . . . in attacking a numerically superior force in the face of intense fire ."  Elliott had previously defended Kerry on that score when his record was questioned during his 1996 Senate campaign. At that time Elliott came to Boston and said Kerry acted properly and deserved the Silver Star. And as recently as June, 2003, Elliott called Kerry's Silver Star "well deserved" and his action "courageous" for beaching his boat in the face of an ambush:        Elliott (Boston Globe, June 2003): &#160;I ended up writing it up for a  Silver Star, which is well deserved , and I have no regrets or second thoughts at all about that. . . .  (It) was pretty courageous to turn into an ambush &#160;even though you usually find no more than two or three people there.       Elliott now feels differently, and says he has come to believe Kerry didn't deserve&#160;his second&#160;award for valor, either, based only on what the other anti-Kerry veterans have told him. He told the Globe Aug. 6:        Elliott: &#160;I have chosen to believe the other men. I absolutely do not know first hand.       The Bronze Star     The most serious allegation in the ad is that Kerry received both&#160;the Bronze Star, his second-highest decoration, and&#160;his third purple heart, which&#160;allowed him to be sent home early, under false pretenses. But that account is flatly contradicted by Jim Rassmann, the former Army Lieutenant whom Kerry rescued that day.     Van O'Dell, a former Navy enlisted man who says he was the gunner on another Swift Boat, states in his affidavit that he was "a few yards away" from Kerry's boat on March 13, 1969 when Kerry pulled&#160;Rassman from the water. According to the official medal citations, Kerry's boat was under enemy fire at the time, and Kerry had been wounded when an enemy mine exploded near his own boat.   O'Dell insists "there was no fire" at the time, adding: "I did not hear any shots, nor did any hostile fire hit any boats" other than his own, PCF-3.     Others in the ad back up&#160;that account. Jack Chenoweth, who was a Lieutenant (junior grade) commanding PCF-3,&#160;said Kerry's boat "fled the scene" after a mine blast disabled PCF-3, and returned only later "when it was apparent that&#160;there was no return fire." And Larry Thurlow, who says he commanded a third Swift Boat that day, says "Kerry fled while we stayed to fight," and&#160;returned only later "after&#160;no return fire occurred."               &#160;  Kerry Ad "Heart"       John Kerry : I was born in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital in Colorado, my dad was serving in the Army air corps. Both of my parents taught me about public service. I enlisted because I believed in service to country. I thought it was important, if you had a lot of privileges as I had had, to go to a great university like Yale, that you give something back to your country.      Del Sandusky: The decisions that he made saved our lives.       Jim Rassmann: When he pulled me out of the river, he risked his life to save mine.&#160;       Narrator : For more than 30 years John Kerry has served America.      Vanessa Kerry : If you look at my father's time and service to this country, whether it has been a veteran, prosecutor, or Senator, he has shown an ability to fight for things that matter.      Teresa Kerry : John is the face of someone who is hopeful, who is generous of spirit, and of heart.      John Kerry  : We're a country of optimists...we're the can-do people, and we just need to believe in ourselves again.&#160;      Narrator : A lifetime of service and strength: John Kerry for President.             None of those in the attack&#160;ad by the Swift Boat group actually served on Kerry's boat. And their&#160;statements are contrary to the accounts of Kerry and those&#160;who served under him.&#160;     Jim Rassmann was the Army Special Forces lieutenant whom&#160;Kerry plucked from the water. Rassmann has said all along that he was under sniper fire from both banks of the river when Kerry, wounded, helped him aboard. Rassmann is featured in an earlier Kerry ad, in fact, (see script at left) saying "he (Kerry) risked his life to save mine."     On Aug. 10, Rassmann wrote a vivid account of the rescue in the  Wall Street Journal  that contradicts the Kerry accusers. Rassmann said that after the first explosion that disabled PCF-3:        Rassmann:   Machine-gun fire erupted from both banks of the river  and a second explosion followed moments later. The second blast blew me off John's swift boat, PCF-94, throwing me into the river. Fearing that the other boats would run me over, I swam to the bottom of the river and stayed there as long as I could hold my breath.     When I surfaced, all the swift boats had left, and  I was alone taking fire from both banks. To avoid the incoming fire I repeatedly swam under water  as long as I could hold my breath, attempting to make it to the north bank of the river. I thought I would die right there. The odds were against me avoiding the incoming fire and, even if I made it out of the river, I thought I thought I'd be captured and executed. Kerry must have seen me in the water and directed his driver, Del Sandusky, to turn the boat around. Kerry's boat ran up to me in the water, bow on, and I was able to climb up a cargo net to the lip of the deck. But, because I was nearly upside down, I couldn't make it over the edge of the deck. This left me hanging out in the open, a perfect target.  John, already wounded by the explosion that threw me off his boat, came out onto the bow, exposing himself to the fire directed at us from the jungle, and pulled me aboard.        Rassmann said he recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for that action, and learned only later that the Bronze Star had been awarded instead. "To this day I still believe he deserved the Silver Star for his courage," he wrote. Rassmann described himself as a retired lieutenant with the&#160;Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "I am a Republican, and for more than 30 years I have largely voted for Republicans," Rassmann said. But he said Kerry "will be a great commander in chief."     "This smear campaign has been launched by people without decency," Rassmann said. " Their new charges are false ; their stories are fabricated, made up by people who did not serve with Kerry in Vietnam."     The Third Purple Heart     The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth further says Kerry didn't deserve his third purple heart, which was received for shrapnel wounds in left buttocks and contusions on right forearm. The Swift Boat group's affidavits state that the wound in Kerry's backside happened earlier that day in an accident. "Kerry inadvertently wounded himself in the fanny," Thurlow said in his affidavit, "by throwing a grenade too close (to destroy a rice supply) and suffered minor shrapnel wounds."     The&#160;grenade incident is&#160;actually supported by Kerry's own account, but the shrapnel wound&#160;was only part of the basis for Kerry's third purple heart according to official documents. The evidence here is contradictory.     Kerry's account is in&#160;   the book  Tour of Duty  by Douglas Brinkley, who based it largely on Kerry's own Vietnam diaries and 12 hours of interviews with Kerry. "I got a piece of small grenade in my ass from one of the rice-bin explosions and then we started to move back to the boats," Kerry is quoted as saying on page 313.&#160;In that account, Kerry says his arm was hurt later,&#160;after the mine&#160; blast that disabled PCF-3, when a second explosion rocked his own boat. "The concussion threw me violently against the bulkhead on the door and I smashed my arm," Kerry says on page 314.     And according to a Navy&#160; urlLink casualty report  released by the Kerry campaign, the third purple heart&#160;was received for "shrapnel wounds in left buttocks&#160;and contusions on his right forearm when a mine detonated close aboard PCF-94," Kerry's boat.&#160;As a matter of strict grammar, the report doesn't state that both injuries were received as a result of the mine explosion, only the arm injury.     The official&#160; urlLink citation  &#160;for Kerry's Bronze Star refers only to his arm injury, not to the shrapnel wound to his rear. It says he&#160;performed the&#160;rescue&#160;"from an exposed position on the bow, his arm bleeding and in pain." The description of Kerry's arm "bleeding" isn't consistent with the description of a "contusion," or bruise.     Rassmann's Aug. 10  Wall Street Journal  article states that Kerry's arm was "wounded by the explosion that threw me off his boat," which would make that wound clearly enemy-inflicted.     In any case,  even a "friendly fire" injury can qualify for a purple heart  "as long as the 'friendly' projectile or agent was released with the full intent of inflicting damage or destroying enemy troops or equipment," according to the&#160; urlLink website &#160;of the Military Order of the Purple Heart. All agree that rice was being destroyed that day on the assumption that&#160;it otherwise might&#160;feed Viet Cong fighters.     Another major discrepancy raises a question of how close Kerry's accusers actually were to the rescue of Rassmann.  Tour of Duty  describes Rassmann's rescue (and the sniper fire)&#160;as happening "several hundred yards back" from where the crippled PCF-3 was lying, not "a few yards away," the distance from which the anti-Kerry veterans claim to have witnessed the incident.      First Purple Heart      Two who appear in the ad say Kerry didn't deserve his  first  purple heart.&#160;    Louis Letson, a medical officer and Lieutenant Commander, says in the ad that he knows Kerry is lying about his first purple heart because &#8220;I treated him for that.&#8221;  &#160;  However, medical records provided by the Kerry campaign to FactCheck.org do not list Letson as the &#8220;person administering treatment&#8221; for Kerry&#8217;s injury on  December 3, 1968  .&#160; The medical officer who signed this sick call report is J.C. Carreon, who is listed as&#160;treating&#160;Kerry for shrapnel to the left arm.     In his affidavit, Letson says&#160;Kerry's wound was&#160;self-inflicted and does not merit a purple heart.&#160;But that's based on hearsay, and disputed hearsay at that. Letson&#160;says&#160;&#8220;the crewman with Kerry told me there was no hostile fire, and that Kerry had inadvertently wounded himself with an M-79 grenade.&#8221; But the Kerry campaign says the two crewmen with Kerry that day deny ever talking to Letson.     Also appearing in the ad is&#160;   Grant Hibbard, Kerry&#8217;s commanding officer at the time. Hibbard&#8217;s affidavit says that he &#8220;turned down the Purple Heart request,&#8221; and&#160;recalled Kerry's injury&#160;as a "tiny scratch less than from a rose thorn."&#160;     That doesn't quite square with Letson's affidavit, which describes shrapnel "lodged in Kerry's arm" (though "barely.")     Hibbard also told the  Boston Globe  in an interview in April 2004 that he eventually acquiesced about granting Kerry the purple heart.        Hibbard : I do remember some questions on it. . .I finally said, OK if that's what happened. . . do whatever you want       Kerry got the first&#160;purple heart&#160;after Hibbard left to return to the   US   .&#160;     McCain Speaks Up     Sen. John McCain&#160;-- who has publicly&#160;endorsed Bush and even&#160;appealed for donations to the President's campaign -- came to Kerry's defense on this.&#160;McCain&#160;didn't witness the events in question, of course. But he&#160;told the&#160;Associated Press in an August&#160;5 interview:        McCain  : I think the ad is dishonest and dishonorable.&#160;As it is none of these individuals served on the boat (Kerry) commanded. Many of his crewmates have testified to his courage under fire.&#160; I think John Kerry served honorably in Vietnam.       At this point, 35 years later and half a world away, we see no way to resolve which of these versions of reality is closer to the truth.

						    urlLink Online article here   WASHINGTON - One of the authors of a new anti-John Kerry (news - web sites) book frequently posted comments on a conservative Web site describing Muslims and Catholics as pedophiles and Pope John Paul II as senile.  But as he prepared to launch the book, "Unfit for Command," Jerry Corsi apologized for the remarks in an interview with The Associated Press Tuesday, saying they were meant as a joke and he never intended to offend anyone.  In chat room entry last year on freerepublic.com, Corsi writes: "Islam is a peaceful religion — just as long as the women are beaten, the boys buggered and the infidels are killed."  In another entry, he says: "So this is what the last days of the Catholic Church are going to look like. Buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the Vatican altars. We may get one more Pope, when this senile one dies, but that's probably about it."  Corsi, who described himself as a "devout Catholic," said the comments are being taken out of context. "I considered them a joke," said Corsi, who owns a financial services company and has written extensively on the anti-war movement.  In a March posting, Corsi discussed Kerry's faith, writing: "After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judaism? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?"  Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, are Catholic.  "I don't stand by any of those comments and I apologize if they offended anybody," Corsi said.  The Kerry campaign called Corsi's Web chat postings disgusting.  "President Bush should immediately condemn this sleazy book written by a virulent anti-Catholic bigot. It says something about the smear campaign against John Kerry that it has stooped to enlist a hatemonger," said campaign spokesman Chad Clanton.  Calls to the Bush-Cheney campaign were not immediately returned.  "Unfit for Command," which goes on sale Wednesday, accuses the Democratic presidential nominee of lying about his decorated wartime record and betraying comrades by returning from Vietnam and alleging widespread atrocities by U.S. troops.  The book claims that Kerry earned his Silver Star not in a barrage of enemy fire, but rather by killing a fleeing Viet Cong teenager. It also questions the three Purple Hearts that Kerry earned, saying that none was for serious injuries and two wounds were self-inflicted.  According to medical records from his naval service, Kerry still has shrapnel in his thigh from a war injury.  "I think it's important the country have the facts about John Kerry so that they can reach a reasonable decision," said co-author John O'Neill, who succeeded Kerry in command of a swift boat. O'Neill also is spokesman for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which began airing an anti-Kerry ad last week.   John O'Neill and the other authors of this book on Kerry never served with Kerry. Those who did serve with him say that this book is nonsense, and they support Kerry wholeheartedly. O'Neill became skipper of Kerry's swift boat after Kerry left Viet Nam, but never met him until after then President Richard Nixon picked O'Neill to go after Kerry because Kerry had become involved in the anti-war effort, and had testified before Congress. After Kerry came back from serving in combat in Viet Nam he learned that the Viet Nam war was based on lies of former President Johnson that Vietnamese had attacked US ships in the Gulf of Tonkin. Johnson got Congress to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that alled him to start the Viet Nam war (sound familiar?). Kerry met with dozens of other Viet Nam vets many of whom were distraught over the fact that they had knowingly killed civilians, and worse. They confessed these acts to one another at the  urlLink Winter Soldiers Investigation  in Detroit in 1971. These acts were often encouraged by military superiors. Nixon had to silence Kerry, and so Nixon picked John O'Neill who has been dogging Kerry ever since, and working for and with the Republican Party for 30 years. Now he tries to claim that he is "non-partisan" and only after the truth, but the sailors who served with Kerry say that O'Neill is full of sh*t. O'Neill's handlers got a doctor to say that Kerry's injuries weren't serious on the occasion of one of his purple hearts. The only problem is that this doctor didn't examine Kerry. A different one did, who agreed that the injuries were serious. Kerry still has shrapnel in his body from the war that the doctors couldn't remove without endangering his life. Of course to O'Neill and hatemonger Jerry Corsi, co-authors of the anti-Kerry book, that is not serious at all. I suspect that Kerry's crew didn't like O'Neill compared to their old skipper, Kerry, and O'Neill has been bitter about coming up second to Kerry ever since. He has to bring Kerry down to satisfy his own wounded ego. Unfortunately for O'Neill they don't give purple hearts for injured pride!

						    urlLink  "None of the evidence found in Pakistan indicated that preparations for an attack on the buildings in New York, Washington and New Jersey went beyond the planning stage." said Larry Johnson, a former top CIA and State Department counterterrorism official.   Also keep in mind that this "evidence" of a "serious threat to New York" was 3 years old, and most of it predated the September 11, 2001 attacks. So with Bush less popular than Kerry in the polls, and a New York GOP convention expected to have tens of thousands of protesters kept a safe distance away in "Free Speech Zones" the Bush admin announces that New York needs to be locked down (and dissidents further restrained for security sake), based on 3 year old data that never got past the "planning stage." We were told that certain financial institutions were specifically targeted, and yet  urlLink Bush sends his wife and daughters to CitiCorp one of the targets of this 3 year old attack.  Is he trying to kill them off? No, he just realizes that they are in no immediate danger. It was just a scare tactic to boost his numbers, and take focus off Kerry, and allow the GOP to curtail those nasty American Citizens who disagree with Bush from publicly protesting. Darn that First Amendment! It always gets in the Bush Administration's way! Except when they stomp all over it, that is.

						    urlLink Online story here    WASHINGTON - August 3 - Halliburton's board of directors has given nearly $300,000 to Republican candidates and political action committees over the 2004 campaign season, a HalliburtonWatch analysis reveals. The board, comprised mostly of individuals from the energy industry, gave $296,065 (or 99 percent) to the Republicans and $4,000 (or 1 percent) to the Democrats. Halliburton's political action committee gave another $133,500 to political campaigns, with $120,000 (or 90 percent) going to the Republicans. The dollar amounts are current through June 30, 2004 and were obtained from the Center for Responsive Politics.  The biggest political donor on Halliburton's board is Ray Hunt, who is the chief executive officer of Hunt Oil, a privately-owned oil company with operations in the middle east, Africa and South America. Its major oil production operations are located in the United States, Canada and Yemen.  Hunt, who inherited his "success" from his wealthy father H.L. Hunt, is notorious for protecting his inheritance by supporting pro-oil causes around the world, including fellow oil man President George W. Bush, who appointed Hunt as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee's Victory 2000 Committee. During the 2000 campaign, Hunt was designated as one of the 241 Bush "Pioneers" because he raised more than $100,000 in campaign donations from his family, friends and colleagues. Former President George H.W. Bush's press secretary in the White House, Jim Oberwetter, had worked for Ray Hunt for nearly three decades.  Federal election records show that Hunt and his wife have so far donated $120,000 of their own money to the 2004 election cycle. All of that money went to Republican candidates or Republican political action committees.  One month after Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Hunt was appointed by President Bush to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. He also serves as chairman of the board for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and is a member of the National Petroleum Council, an industry trade group that advises the president on energy policy. Vice President Cheney also served as a member of the Council during his tenure as CEO for Halliburton. In addition, Hunt serves on the board of trustees for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a foreign policy think tank which often supports causes that benefit global oil and gas projects in the Third World. One of those projects, known as the Camisea Natural Gas Project, is located in the Peruvian Amazon rain forest where both Hunt Oil and Halliburton's KBR subsidiary will build a natural gas liquefication plant. Environmental groups say it is the most environmentally damaging project in the Amazon Basin. The (London) Independent newspaper reported that the project "will enrich some of [President Bush's] closest corporate campaign contributors" but that it "risks the destruction of one of the world's remaining pristine stretches of rain forest and threatens the lives of indigenous peoples."  The second biggest campaign contributor on Halliburton's board of directors is J. Landis Martin, who gave $87,500 to Republican candidates and political action committees in Colorado, Texas, Louisiana, Illinois and Iowa. Martin was the chief executive of Baroid Corp. until it became a subsidiary of Halliburton through the 1998 merger of Halliburton and Dresser Industries. Today, he serves as chairman of the board, CEO and president of Titanium Metals Corp. (TIMET). TIMET is a Denver-based manufacturer of titanium metals used in the manufacture of military and civilian aircraft, military armor, offshore oil and gas production installations and automobiles. Sixty-eight percent of TIMET's revenue is derived from sales to the aerospace industry (57 percent to commercial aerospace and 11 percent to military aerospace). TIMET's shipments to military aerospace companies increased by 15 percent in 2003. In a filing with the federal government, it said "the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities and global conflicts."  The third biggest campaign contributor on Halliburton's board is Cecil J. "Pete" Silas (or C.J. Silas), retired chief executive of Phillips Petroleum Co., now known as ConocoPhillips. Silas donated $37,750 to Republican candidates and political action committees in Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia. His largest donation was $30,000 to the Republican National Committee. ConocoPhillips is a leading petroleum exploration and production company. It is also involved in oil refining and marketing and in the manufacture, distribution and export of a wide variety of chemicals. In addition to serving on Halliburton's board, Silas has served as a member of, and donor to, the Council on Foreign Relations, a far-right wing think tank that advocates U.S. military and corporate intervention into the economic and political affairs of Third World nations. He also served on the Atlantic Council's Working Group that produced a May 2001 report calling for the end of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, a nation President Bush says sponsors terrorism. The Council's 2001 report said, "Iran currently accounts for 5 percent of worldwide oil production and is the second largest oil exporter in OPEC. The country needs significantly increased capital investment to maintain its current level of production...." The Council lamented that "U.S. companies are losing opportunities [in Iran] to their European and Asian competitors." Vice President Cheney had also called for ending sanctions against Iran while chief executive of Halliburton. Moreover, under pressure from Big Oil, the Republican Congress in May refused to expand sanctions that would have prohibited Halliburton from selling equipment to Iran through its foreign subsidiaries.  The fourth biggest campaign contributor on Halliburton's board is Kenneth Derr, retired chief executive of Chevron, now known as ChevronTexaco -- a leading refiner and marketer of oil products worldwide. Derr's $29,000 donation includes $25,000 to the Republican National Committee and $4,000 to the Bush/Cheney campaign. In 1998, Derr said, "Iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas - reserves I'd love Chevron to have access to."  The fifth biggest campaign contributor on the board is Jay A. Precourt, chief executive of the Denver-based Scissor Tail Energy, LLC. Precourt has so far donated $9,815 in 2004 to Republicans, including $1,315 to the Colorado Senate bid of Pete Coors, chairman of Coors Brewing Co., which is also an unabashed supporter of Republican causes. Scissor Tail Energy is a gatherer, transporter and processor of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Precourt is also chairman of Hermes Consolidated, Inc., a gatherer, transporter and refiner of crude oil and refined products.  The remaining board members donated $5,000 or less to Republican political campaigns, including $5,000 donated to Halliburton's political action committee by the company's chief executive, David Lesar.  Robert Crandall, the retired chief executive of AMR, which owns American Airlines, was the only board member to donate money to the Democrats. He donated $2,000 to Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign and $2,000 to Gov. Howard Dean's failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Of the board members who donated money to political campaigns, Mr. Crandall was the only board member who did not donate to the Republicans.  According to a report from the Center for Responsive Politics, President Bush has received the most campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry of any politician since 1998 (1.7 million dollars). That total is more than three times the amount given to the next largest recipient of the industry's campaign contributions.   Surprise surprise! Haliburton gives to Republicans including the yearly deferred salary that Vice President Cheney still received from them along with his huge stock portfolio of Haliburton Shares, and as a result Haliburton's officers get appointments to advise the President on Foreign Relations and Haliburton keeps getting no-bid contracts from the Government despite repeated investigations that they have cheated the US taxpayers by overcharging for gas which they sell for a dime in Iraq to keep the Iraqis happy (not working by the way), and overcharge us for meals they said they provided to our troops but didn't,  urlLink cooking the books to defraud stockholders ,  urlLink committing bribary , etc. etc. etc. Read  urlLink http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/  to learn more about Cheney's company an how they are ripping us off and violating laws with abandon.

						    urlLink Statement of Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook   The penalty imposed today against Halliburton to settle allegations of accounting irregularities when Vice President Dick Cheney was at the company’s helm is too small and avoids addressing Cheney’s responsibility for the fraud.  To settle allegations that the company improperly altered its accounting during Cheney’s tenure as CEO, Halliburton agreed to pay just $7.5 million, which pales in comparison to the estimated $120 million by which accounting tricks boosted Halliburton’s profits during Cheney’s stewardship.  Cheney was Halliburton’s CEO from 1995 to 2000. Beginning in 1997, crude oil prices began a sharp decline, falling 50 percent from January 1997 to March 1998. This drop in the price of a commodity upon which Halliburton was dependent rocked the company’s bottom line. Under financial pressure, the company in April 1998 embarked on a radical change in its accounting practices: It began booking cost overruns in its construction business as income, rather than as expenses, and did not adequately disclose this change in practice until a year later. As a direct result of not properly reporting this accounting change, Halliburton was able to boost its reported profits by more than $120 million, misleading investors.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted in a complaint released today that it is the SEC’s “view that there were unacceptable lapses in the company’s conduct during the course of the investigation, which had the effect of delaying the production of information and documentation necessary to the staff’s expeditious completion of its investigation.”   The failure of the SEC to address the responsibility of Cheney, who was in charge when the accounting irregularities occurred, and instead focus upon the company’s chief financial officer and controller at the time, indicates that politics may have spared Cheney from necessary enforcement action. The CFO and controller both reported to Cheney, and he ultimately should be held responsible.

						    urlLink Online article here    Today the Times  urlLink reports  that the SEC has fined Halliburton $7.5 million for, in effect, defrauding its shareholders.   The charges stem from a change in accounting methods Halliburton made in 1998. The SEC found that the old and the new accounting methods were both permissible under accepted practices. The key, however, is that Halliburton did not inform investors of the change. That allowed Halliburton to "report annual earnings in 1998 that were 46 percent higher than they would have been had the change not been made ... [and] a substantially higher profit in 1999."   This change came just as Halliburton was struggling with falling share prices that threatened to sink its proposed merger with Dresser Industries.   Again from the Times ... It reported a 34 percent gain in profit for the quarter, far better than other oil services companies were reporting, and Mr. Cheney said then that "Halliburton continues to make good financial progress despite uncertainties over future oil demand."   The commission said yesterday that the gain would have been just 6.7 percent without the undisclosed change in accounting policies.  The SEC and the even the Times goes to some length to avoid the colloquial term for this sort of behavior: i.e., fraud. The SEC did levy the fine. And it did point the finger of blame at two lower levels Halliburton officials. Yet the SEC, in the words of the Times, "did not detail the extent to which [Cheney] was aware of the change or of the requirement to disclose it to investors." And not surprisingly, in the article, Cheney's lawyer, Terrence O'Donnell is trumpeting the results of the investigation as a clean bill of health for Cheney.   Now, with a whitewash, you might at least expect that Cheney would be denying knowledge that this took place, as implausible as it might sound. But he won't. After taking down O'Donnell's crowing about the results of the investigation, the Times asked whether Cheney "had been aware of the effect of the accounting change on the company's profits." But O'Donnell wouldn't answer.   So here you have the Vice President of the United States. His company gets caught in about as clear a case of cooking the books to inflate profits as you can imagine during the time he was CEO. (His salary and bonuses are tied to company profits.) And he won't even go to the trouble of denying that he was aware of the wrongdoing. Can we have some more aggressive reporting on this one?-- Josh Marshall  No, Josh, that would be too much to ask of the Corporate-Owned US News Media Outlets that they aggressively report anything negative about a high ranking member of the Bush Administration. They will  urlLink smear Kerry  and  urlLink other Democrats  until the  urlLink cows come home , but they won't lift a finger to actually investigate let alone report the wrongdoing of the Bush Cartel.

						    urlLink Online article here   The phrase "this is what democracy looks like" changed meaning as the protest of President Bush's appearance in Springfield unfolded. Initially, the phrase described the thousands of people lined up with tickets, waiting to enter the field house, being reminded not all people in southwest Missouri thought this president deserved four more years of leadership that had launched wars resulting in thousands dead and tens of thousands wounded, a national debt increasing at $1.69 billion a day, and an atmosphere of secrecy in America. The Secret Service told protesters where to gather; the location was excellent. Democracy was working: People were exercising their right to assemble while others exercised their right to protest. But when police told protesters they had to move about 200 feet away, while the people supporting Bush remained in place, the atmosphere grew tense. When protesters complained to local police, they replied, "We're just following orders." Then the protesters called the media: It was time for citizens to know how democracy was working in Springfield, as protesters had been herded into a "free speech zone." When gatekeepers announced final seating for those with tickets, protesters with tickets tried to get in, but their tickets were grabbed and torn up, and police threatened them with arrest if they argued back. One woman screamed, "You're tearing up my ticket," and hit back at the man when he started shoving her with his chest, trying to shut her up. The police arrested the woman. Two other people were "taken down": a young girl who could not back up fast enough because there were so many people behind her and a man who is charged with trespassing because he was standing on property his own tax dollars partially funded. All this, while the Bush supporters passed by, granted access to the president of us all because they would shout his praises at the appropriate moments. When "this is what democracy looks like" arose from the protesters this time, it had an ominous tone. People were being taken down, and the picture was not pretty.  This is what happens every time Bush or any Bush Administration official speaks in public in their capacity as our leaders. Dissenters are shunted off to "Free Speech Zones" where cameras and the Press cannot see them. Even when they have tickets to see the President speak their tickets are torn up, and they are arrested if they complain. This is indeed Bushocracy the Bizzaro World version of Democracy! Ever heard this covered on the Evening News? No, I didn't think so. The US News Media Outlets are particularly mum on how the Bush Administration restricts the rights of American Citizens who disagree with their policies. Isn't this what happened in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s? I'm just asking.

						   Here are some recent news items:  Oops! We  urlLink lost  $1 billion in Iraq.  Oh well, at least Halliburton is keeping track of  urlLink everything  okay.

In these political times, the  urlLink trivial  always triumphs.  Musicians from all genres are spreading the word that  urlLink apathy  is no longer cool.  Ring another one up for GWB's "compassionate conservatism." The EPA will be able to  urlLink approve  pesticides without consulting wildlife agencies to determine their chemical harm.

						    urlLink Article Online Here     Most of the al Qaeda surveillance of five financial institutions that led to a new terrorism alert Sunday was conducted before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and authorities are not sure whether the casing of the buildings has continued, numerous intelligence and law enforcement officials said yesterday. "There is nothing right now that we're hearing that is new," said one senior law enforcement official who was briefed on the alert. "Why did we go to this level? . . . I still don't know that."  One piece of information on one building, which intelligence officials would not name, appears to have been updated in a computer file as late as January 2004, according to a senior intelligence official. But officials could not say yesterday whether that piece of data was the result of active surveillance by al Qaeda or came instead from information about the buildings that is publicly available.  Several officials also said that much of the information compiled by terrorist operatives about the buildings in Washington, New York and Newark was obtained through the Internet or other "open sources" available to the general public, including some floor plans.  The characterization of the age of the intelligence yesterday cast a new light on Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge's announcement Sunday that the terrorism threat alert for the financial services sectors in the three cities had been raised. Ridge and other officials stressed Sunday the urgency of acting on the newly obtained information, but yesterday a range of officials made clear how dated much of the intelligence was.  President Bush and Vice President Cheney said in separate appearances yesterday that the new alert underscores the continuing threat posed by al Qaeda. At a news conference announcing his proposed intelligence reforms, Bush said the alert shows "there's an enemy which hates what we stand for." "It's serious business," Bush said. "I mean, we wouldn't be, you know, contacting authorities at the local level unless something was real."  The day Kerry makes his "John Kerry reporting for duty speech" (just hours before it in fact)  urlLink Pakistan follows White House orders  and announces the caption of the most wanted al-Qaida member (no, not Osama--someone we've never heard of). Now when polls show that Kerry is beating Bush 50% to 43% they announce a CODE ORANGE ALERT on financial institutions based on data from before September 11, 2001. Three years old this data is, and they happen to announce the warning now just when Bush needs a little boost in ratings. Haven't we seen this kind of manipulation of the news for three and a half years now? When will the Corporate Owned Media tell the truth to the American People? When will the American People realize that the Corporate Owned Media has been aiding and abetting the misleading of the US citizens? When they do, ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and of course Faux News' asses will be grass! We need to bring the curtain down on these misleaders starting with Bush, and continuing with the Corporate Owned Media Moguls who are their accomplices!

						   by Jim Hightower - jimhightower.com 08.02.04 - What do Kalamazoo, Evansville, Albuquerque, Stockton, Trenton, Phoenix, Columbia, St. Louis, Knoxville, and Charleston have in common? All are among the cities where the secret service or police have jailed people for displaying anti-Bush signs during public appearances by his eminence, King George the W. Is this America, The Land of the Free? That's what Nicole and Jeff Rank asked themselves this July 4th as they were taken away in handcuffs by police in their town of Charleston, West Virginia. What was their heinous crime? They were guilty of not being Bush supporters. George W's Independence Day trip to Charleston was billed as an official presidential visit, not a campaign rally. Nicole and Jeff –– two patriotic, hardworking, taxpaying Americans –– were in the crowd, quietly exercising their free-speech rights. They wore T-shirts declaring: "Love America, Hate Bush." They had proper tickets to the event, they proudly sang the National Anthem with everyone else, they were in no way disorderly –– but they were not politically correct, so they were summarily arrested, taken to jail, finger printed... and charged with "trespassing." Others who were there wearing pro-Bush T-shirts and Bush campaign paraphernalia at this public event on public property were not arrested. It seems that the Bushites define "trespassers" by their political beliefs. Nicole, who worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Charleston, was promptly told that her services were no longer required. Technically, she wasn't fired, but she was "released" from her job and not reassigned –– meaning she no longer gets paid. But Nicole and Jeff are still not bowing to King George. Despite the financial hardship, they're fighting Bush's absurd, un-American assault on their constitutional right to dissent. They're not the only ones being denied their right to speak out –– dissenters all across America are being treated like this. To fight this autocratic lockdown, call the ACLU: 212-549-2500. "We weren't doing anything wrong." By Tara Tuckwiller, The Charelston Gazette, July 14, 2004.

						    urlLink Article Here  On July 29, CNN apparently forgot a major story the network had reported just three weeks earlier. On July 8, The New Republic posted to its website an article titled " urlLink July Surprise ," which was written by TNR's  urlLink John B. Judis ,  urlLink Spencer Ackerman , and  urlLink Massoud Ansari  and published in the July 19 issue of the magazine. Judis, Ackerman, and Ansari quoted two sources from Pakistan's intelligence service and another from its Interior Ministry (which handles the country's internal security) saying that the Bush administration was pressuring Pakistani officials to make arrests of so-called "high-value targets" (HVTs) during the 2004 Democratic National Convention. According to "July Surprise," one source said: "The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [Pakistani intelligence director General Ehsan ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington." The article continued: "[A] White House aide had told him that 'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July.' -- the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston." On July 7, TNR's editor,  urlLink Peter Beinart , appeared on CNN's  urlLink NewsNight with Aaron Brown  to discuss the article, which TNR had announced it would release the following day. But on July 29, when the event TNR foreshadowed actually occurred -- Reuters  urlLink reported  that Pakistani forces had arrested Ahmed Khalfan Ghailini, an Al Qaeda suspect in the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania -- it became apparent that CNN's reporters and anchors had suffered a collective amnesia. The network reported the story of the capture with no mention of the TNR story to which CNN had devoted so much attention three weeks earlier. CNN's  urlLink Aaron Brown  had introduced Beinart on July 7 as follows: BROWN: The New Republic, in a piece to be released tomorrow, will allege that the administration through various means is pressuring the government of Pakistan to deliver bin Laden and his henchmen before the November election, preferably during the Democratic Convention a couple of weeks from now. It's clear from this quotation that Brown understood the significance of the story. Indeed, CNN replayed clips of Beinart's appearance throughout the following day, and Beinart made another brief live appearance as well. As of this writing, however, neither CNN nor any other news network has mentioned the TNR article. On CNN, anchor  urlLink Judy Woodruff  first reported the arrest at around 4:15 pm (ET) on July 29: WOODRUFF: We have some news just in to CNN. Pakistani security forces have captured a high-level Al Qaeda operative wanted in connection with the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa. Pakistan's Interior Minister says Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, captured a few days ago, shows that the Pakistani government is committed to fighting terrorism. In all, 224 people were killed in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. About one hour later, CNN anchor  urlLink Wolf Blitzer  recapped news of the arrest before introducing CNN's Islamabad bureau chief,  urlLink Ash-har Quraishi , who reported the story by phone live from Pakistan. Neither Blitzer nor Quraishi brought up the " urlLink July Surprise " angle, even as Quraishi reported that Ghailani had been captured "early on Sunday" -- meaning that he was captured more than three days before the Democratic National Convention began but that the news media was not informed until hours before Senator John Kerry's climactic speech on its final day: QURAISHI: Pakistani officials confirming to us tonight that they have arrested Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani. He's somebody listed by the FBI as one of the most wanted terrorists. Now Ghailani was picked up in weekend raids that were conducted in central Pakistan early on Sunday. Over a dozen suspects were picked up in those raids. They say over the last few days they have been working on identifying those people. One of them they say is one of the most wanted listed by the FBI -- this Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani. Now this operation lasted more than twelve hours, they say, a shoot-out ensured, and then the security forces were able to go in and arrest these people. Now we understand from officials that the interrogations are continuing here in Pakistan by security forces. At some point we expect, however, that Ghailani will be handed over to the United States. Wolf. BLITZER: Ash-har Quraishi reporting for us on this late-breaking story. Thanks very much Ash-har, very much. Let's get back to the convention now.  — G.W.

						   Even reporters wanting to attend the Vice President’s speech were required to sign Loyalty Oath swearing allegiance to Bush if they were not registered Republicans.  Here is the text of that Loyalty Oath:  'I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States.' It later adds that, 'In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush.'  The John Kerry/John Edwards campaign on Thursday issued a news release that asked, "Shouldn't all New Mexicans have the right to see their VP?"  When Kerry visited Albuquerque earlier this month, a contingent of Bush supporters were in the crowd. The Associated Press has reported that the group chanted "Viva Bush!" during the event. The AP added that Kerry urged the crowd to tolerate the Bush supporters.  Whenever top Bush Administration officials speak, protestors are kept miles away in "Free Speech Zones" and reporters are not allowed to interview them. Kerry's response in Arizona and Cheney's illustrate a vast difference between the Bush/Cheney camp and the Kerry/Edwards camp with regard for tolerating dissent.  I bet this won't even be covered on the evening news. Nor will the race of the reporter question posted below. The vast majority of the American people will have no idea what Bush and Company are doing.

						    urlLink Americans who want to hear their Vice President speak  must sign Loyalty Oaths that they will support the election of President Bush in November. Americans who want to see their Vice President who will not swear allegiance to Bush/Cheney will not be allowed in. Vietnam veteran Michael Ortiz y Pino said he refused to sign the pledge and was refused tickets. When the Kerry camp was asked about this a spokesman said, "I think that every American should have the right to see their vice president and hear from him firsthand what he plans to do for our country." The Bush camp disagrees. They claim that it is "Secret Security stuff" that requires this. No other candidate in US history has required loyalty oaths of people attending their speeches. Third world countries run by tin pot dictators may have, but not in the USA.  On a related story...  President Bush's re-election campaign  urlLink insisted on knowing the race of an Arizona Daily Star journalist assigned to photograph Vice President Dick Cheney.  When the editor refused to tell them, he was told that the journalist probably wouldn't be allowed to to photograph Cheney. They said that this is to insure the Vice President's safety. I guess Cheney must feel unsafe in the presence of some races of people. I wonder which.

						    urlLink Buzzflash article here  The Republican Party in Florida is advising Republicans to register with the Republican Party to vote absentee ballot so that their votes count. They site the unreliability of the new electronic voting machines. The poster has a smiling picture of Bush with thumbs up.  urlLink Recently  it was found that in 2002 elections in Florida electronic voting machines lost all records of votes. We were told they are gone for good, and there is no backup, no audit trail.  urlLink Suddenly, they said they found them on a CD that had been tucked away in a conference room near the election supervisor's office , but when examined it was discovered that many of the votes were still missing. Far more people signed in, and voted than the votes they suddenly found after declaring them lost for good. (Sounds like the Bush National Guard records that were accidentally destroyed, and then when people complained they were suddenly found except for the ones that really count) And out of the 15 counties using these electronic voting machines there can be no manual recount with at least 11 of them. This situation is repeated throughout the country where electronic voting terminals will be used, and no paper audit trail exists. Some say that across the country up to a quarter of all votes cast in the Presidential Election in November will be cast on these unreliable instruments. The Bush appointee in charge of elections dragged his feet for a couple of years when these complaints were being made to him, and he now announces that there isn't enough time to fix it by the election. Republican officials have been saying that the new machines were perfectly safe. Meanwhile the GOP is telling their party members to vote absentee so that when votes are lost, their votes on paper ballots will still exist and be counted. This is Democracy from a Republican Party standpoint.
