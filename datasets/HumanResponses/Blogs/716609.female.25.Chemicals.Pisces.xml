      I am now at the Pocono's.  hoooorrrraaayyyy!!!  Had a great dinner.  For all of you unfamiliar with the Maryland blue crab craze, (a big thing in the northeast), we had great crabs.  Accompanied with shrimp, clams, softshells, and fresh jersey corn.  Good beginning to a hopefully great week.  Might go boating tomorrow, weather permitting.  FYI, woke up again last night crying with jaw pain.  I think I just need to have it removed.  Going to bed and I am determined to NOT wake up again with pain!  Also, painted the the ceiling last night, but I will get into that later when I am not so tired.

      My body has done it this time...and I thought the jaw pain was tmj.  Woke up crying with horrible jaw pain last night, husband recommended I have an EKG because the pain has been persistent, often followed or accompanied by shortness of breath.  OK, I am a bit of a hypochondriac, I just thought it must be my asthma along with the fact that I am smokey the bear (on crack).  But apparently I have had changes in my EKG, and now need to have stress testing done to rule out, or in, any ischemic heart changes.  GREAT, moving is now going to KILL ME!!!  I did, however, finish painting the bathroom, that would be the room which had the most awful, dated wallpaper that had to be stripped, but only the first layer of the paper came off so I finally just painted over it.  Upon google investigation, this is a huge "no-no" when renovating, but I simply don't care.  It actually looks great, until moisture accumulates for a prolonged period of time in the room, then it tends to bubble.  I suppose  the  new owners  will think they are in the Amityville house.  Bubbling walls, walls that attack you, etc. The foyer is done in a very abrasive sand paint, if you stand too close, it will bite you!  But the bathroom is now done and I am moving on to the ceiling. We finally opened the pool on Wednesday, it looks like pea soup and smells like my butt after painting all day.  But we've been trying to skim all of the green slime out of it and clean it up for "opening day" on the market.  So today we went out to turn on the filter and discovered that a pipe may have froze and burst over the winter, resulting in the heater spewing water and the PVC pipes spraying green slime all over any unsuspecting pool-girl!  Now we have to wait until pool care specialists can come out and fix said problem.  Happily I will be going to the Pocono's this week for some much needed rest and relaxation, although I will be accompanied by one sister,two parents, to nieces, two dogs, a hamster and a guinea pig, so I don't know how much rest I really have in store.

      To downsize, to upsize, to relocate, whatever...  there are tons of good reasons why someone would want to sell their house, but are the hastles worth the benefits? I have been told that moving is one of the most stressfull things a person can do in their lifetime.  I BELIEVE, I REALLY BELIEVE!!!  There are obvious things one must do  in order to get their house on the market(renovate, clean, maintain, clean again, and again, and again... paint, quit smoking because it is undesirable to have your house smell like an ashtray, clean, sequester your beloved baby boy (pug named Max, aka butter) so he doesn't spray all over everything you just CLEANED, pay 6% commission to realator(s), clean again And its only been a week and a half!  Much more to do, going crazy, stress, jaw pain, ahhhh,... a thunderstorm just started! Finally peace for today, until tomorrow, in six hours my neices graduation ceremony begins.  SLEEP.
