      I finally have a chance to breathe.  School is out for the summer, so now is the time to refresh myself and prepare for the fall.  Something came to mind today. . . When things start getting overwhelming at the beginning of the semester, I ask my students one question, "How do you eat an elephant?"  The whole class will look at me with this blank stare, then one students will answer, "A piece at a time!"    Have you ever rushed through life, trying to do it all and worry about how it will all come together? Don't worry about it, God has it under control.  If you put it in God's hands, he will work it out for you.  The tough part is having the patience to let God do his work.  I don't know about you, but I have always found myself wanting everything to be fixed right now.  I can't seem to wait.  I want to know what is going to happen tomorrow.  But guess what, that is contributing to my stress and preventing me from enjoying today.  Tomorrow will come, but  urlLink let tomorrow take care of itself , there is a possibility that today is the last I may get.  So being patient and finding something to smile about today should be enough!  Wait on the Lord he will renew your strength in due time.  :)

      I was feeling kind of down today.  I was flipping through old emails. I found a great one that I hope will add a smile to somebody on this Friday.   urlLink Love  is the answer, but you got to love yourself first before you can truely love another. I am not sure of the author, but this is something to think about. . .Keep Smiling :) because God loves you and so do I!!!!!!!!  [HAPPY FRIDAY, SISTERS!  SISTER TO SISTER...So often, we look at others and compare ourselves to them.   And often, we come up short. We look and say, "Oh she's 25 and she's done this, this, this and this. Or we watch people who "have it all together" and we begin to get down on ourselves. We find any number of ways to compare ourselves to the next sister - and come up short....STOP!  There's a saying that the grass is always greener on the other side.....Well, their water bill is higher too. And guess what? You can have green grass also if you seed, water and fertilize your lawn. You can't have what somebody else has if you're not willing to go through what they went through. But, that's another matter.     Stop comparing yourself to others. Love YOU!!!!   Each of us has our own thorns. Be it weight, single-parenting, job dissatisfaction, husband problems, financial distress, children woes, over-worked/underpaid issues, loneliness, confusion, self-doubt, etc.  You've got to love you, and if you can't do that right now, At least quit comparing yourself to others, because you don't know what they are going through. Someone will always be prettier. They will always be smarter. Their house will be bigger. They will drive a better car. Their children will do better in school. And their husband will fix more things around the house. So let it go, and love you and your circumstances.  Think about it. The prettiest sister in the world can have Hell all up  in her heart. And the most highly favored sister on your job may be unable to have children. And the richest sister you know - she's got the car, the house, the clothes - might be lonely. And the word says if I have not Love, I am nothing.   So, again, love you. Love who you are right now and let God be your barometer.    Mirror Him. Look in the mirror in the morning and see how much God you see. He's the only standard, and even when you come up short, he will not leave you or forsake you.  Smile and may God continue to BLESS YOU Real GOOD!!  "I am too blessed to be stressed and too anointed to be disappointed!"  The shortest distance between a problem and a solution is the distance between your knees and the floor.  "The one who kneels to God can stand up to anything."  "Winners make things happen. Losers let things happen."  Be Blessed ladies and pass this on to encourage another sister.  - author unknown]  :)

      Hello World! I am excited because I woke up this morning and I got another chance at this life.  For those that know me, or know someone like me, things haven't been easy for me lately but I am still here. The amazing thing -- I still manage to smile at least once per day. This blog is dedicated to providing inspiration for those who may have lost hope and bring a smile to your day so that you can enjoy the rest of your life.     I believe that God has given me the purpose to make a positive difference in the lives of others. So take a look at my  urlLink favorite scripture . (By no means do I claim to be perfect, I just want to love my neighbor, one blog at a time.  :)

      One of my mentors (Fred Williams) who graduated from my alma mater, Morris Brown College in Atlanta, GA, also one the first blacks to receive his MBA from Harvard told me these words "Don't let ANYONE break your spirits".  I always remembered these words, but I always thought my mentor was referring to the ANYONES on the job.  You know that boss that is always harassing you or that jealous co-worker who makes several attempts to stab you in the back.    It wasn't until the last few years of my life did I realize the word "ANYONE" did in fact mean anyone.  It could mean a relative or a close friend.  It could mean your child or parent who may have done something to hurt you. It could even mean those church folks/minister who claim to be holier than thou.  Or it can be that special someone you thought was a soul mate and you so unselfishly gave your heart to in the past.   I was guilty of letting that anyone break my spirits, ceasing my hope, and taking away my joy for today.  I am the one that determines my fate which also includes my happiness.  If I don't like what is going on in my life today, I can change it.  It may not be easy or it may not happen over night, but I can change my own life and my current situations.  It just takes a little faith, a little initiative on my part, and of course a little hope.  He has not forsaken you and he surely has not forsaken me. Keep smiling even if the world thinks it is checkmate.  They are a liar! The  urlLink King has another move !  :)

      Living is hard work and sometimes even cumbersome.  I find myself trying to do my day to day responsibilities, but I often do not have time for me.  I get so caught up with doing the basics, I don't have a chance to really enjoy the blessings of today.    When was the last time you took a deep breath and smelled the sweet air of spring?  Or when was the last time you looked at the beautiful trees and flowers God has made?  Or listened to the churping birds?  Or really tasted every morsal of a fattening dessert?  We can get engrossed with day to day activiities, so much that we foget about the good of right now.    That is why it is so important to find a healthy balance.  Take a momment out of each day and enjoy it. You must work a little to prepare for tomorrow but you must also play a little to appreciate today.  Whether it is looking at something pleasant, or smelling something nice, of listening to a beautiful sound, or my favorite, enjoyig the taste of delicous treats.  Just make sure you appreciate what  urlLink God has done  and smile.  :)

      Today is a powerful day.  There is only 24 hours that I will have access to.  I can't do it all today, there are some things that will have to wait until tomorrow or the next day or maybe a year or two from now.  It's funny how life works out in its timing.    We buried my 95 year old grandmother today.  Today was the first time all her grandchildren were together in years.  I was planning a big trip for this weekend, but for whatever reason I ended up planning it for next weekend.   urlLink It just wasn't the right time .  I began my planning several months ago.  Then last Saturday my grandmother died and this is the weekend of her funeral.  He is an awesome God, it not only my own life but others that were depending on his timing.    Think about it, we spend our whole life planning for things.  Projecting dates, prepare time lines, and predicting outcomes but we are not the ones really in control. God is in controls!  Our plans are only request. He is the one that gets the final say so on when our plans will happen.  Our plans will happen on his timing, not our own.  Don't get me wrong, I am not say you shouldn't bother planning.  I am just saying that our Heavenly Father is the one that not only approves whether our plans will or will not occur, but when they will occur.  Go ahead and make your request known to him, but keep in mind He has final authority.  Just go with the flow, since He is working it out for our good in due time.  Keep smiling, the King has another move.  :)

      I have been thinking about the word love.  Specifically, longing for someone to LOVE me, not realizing that the ultimate One already loves me.  His name is Jesus Christ.  He has died for my sins and has accepted me back into His fatherly arms after I make my mistakes time and time again.  Now, if God can love a sinner like me,  urlLink why can't I love  those who have used and hurt me?  I don't know.  It's hard, but not impossible.  I can love if I don't keep focusing on how they treated me in the past.  I can forgive and pray for them today, so that tomorrow I won't still harbor the pains of yesterday.  God will fix them in due time as He is still fixing me.  I just need to stop being so cold and melt a little so that I can love those worthy and unworthy today.  Let go and God's love will not only change your life but He can change others lives with our prayers.  Be sure to keep love behind those smiles.  :)

      I don't get it!  urlLink I just don't understand .  Why do things work out the way they do?  Why does God let things happen the way they do?  Wouldn't it be better if things happened another way?    I think not!  We only see a piece of the "Big Picture", our lives, while God sees and knows everything.  A good example of what could happen if man had the power of God is Jim Carrey's movie "Bruce Almighty".  A mess, that is what you would have.  God is all knowing and all powerful and has the advantage of knowing EVERYONE"s tomorrows.  Now myself, I only know today and can barely remember yesterday.  How could I have the knowledge to know how it SHOULD turn out.  Accept today, enjoy today, and be convinced that when you look back on your life, you will know it worked out the way it was suppose to.   See the movie today, it will make you laugh and put a smile on your face and let you know the Father has it under control even though you may feel like youi really messed up in your past. He is the God of second chances.  :)

      Have you ever tried to fix things and take control of your destiny then worry about the outcome? Well that is me to a 'T'. I have always had the motto that "If it is going to be, it is up to me!" I try to give others a chance to take action, but when I see things failing or not getting done, I often find myself stressed-out trying to do God's works. The outcome will sometimes be good, but more often than not I tend to make a mess of things, especially when dealling with the issues of my own life.  I have to keep reminding myself that  urlLink I am not in control, it is God that is in control  and He knows the final outcome, so I don't need to worry. But that doesn't mean I should become lazy and just wait on whatever happens in my daily life. I am a firm believer that  urlLink God will not do for you what you can do for yourself . Beside he has given each one of us a talents and the abilty to look to him for direction on how to best use those talents to further His kingdom .  So if I do my part today and pray that God continues to Love me and protect me from my mistakes, I will see that  urlLink all things works out for the good!  I can smile knowing I "can't worry and have faith" at the same time.  :)
