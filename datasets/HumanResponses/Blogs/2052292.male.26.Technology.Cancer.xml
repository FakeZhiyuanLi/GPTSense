       Me : Okay, what makes you think you have a virus, ma'am?   Them : Well, I'm not *sure*...but I did get an email with one of those .zip files you warned us customers about.    Me : Ah, yes. If you're unsure of who sent it, and even if it looks like someone you know, but you weren't expecting anything, I would NOT open that attachment. Just delete the email and empty the Deleted Items folder.   Them : .......   Me : You didn't open the attachment, did you?   Them : ...would I be in trouble if I said, 'yes'?

      1)  Not being anywhere near the computer when they call.  This is a common problem and a major pain in the tokus. Especially when the issue requires checking information on the computer such as DNS numbers, the Phone number it's trying to dial or Mail Server entries in Outlook Express. Folks, if you're calling me from Work, and your computer is at HOME.... I. Can't. Help. You.  2)  Computer is not turned on.  This is a major pet peeve of mine. People call me up and want to to help them figure out a problem, and of course, they don't even have their computer turned on. Some believe that they can't use the phone when the computer is powered on for SOME reason that I can only figure originates from once having picked up the phone while they were online and hearing that screaching coming from receiver. From that point forward, I can only imagine that every time they want to make a phone call, they have to shut down their computer thinking that's how it works. *sigh* Well, I have to go through the rigamaroll to explain to them that it's okay to have the computer ON...but they don't have to be ONLINE. Big Difference. (You can hear the lightbulbs blinking on with their realization, oy!)  3)  Attempting to use computer jargon of which they have NO CLUE of it's meaning.  Nothing can make a tech call go completely south faster than a user who thinks they understand computer jargon and start throwing out tech words left and right. When a User starts calling a Floppy Disk a "Hard Disk", the Monitor their "CPU", not to mention the Computer Case their "Modem", it just makes any tech call into an Exedrine headache. Folks, KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS! Installing a program is not called "uploading", your Operating System is not called Internet Explorer or Outlook Express, and there never was a Windows 97, Windows 96, or 2000 XP.  4)  Screaming "HEEEEELLPP!!!" right off the bat  Folks, we know you need help. That's what we do. That's why people call us. We know this. We accept this as our reason for employment. If you didn't need help, you wouldn't be calling us, right? Please don't start off your tech call with such an inane thing as screaming "HELP!" into our already sore and tired ears.  5)  Arguing with us.  Stop. Just stop it already. When you call us for help, we diagnose your problem and suggest a solution. Just humor us.  Try it . DO NOT come back with a snide or crude comment about having tried that already, or saying "That's not correct...". Look, if you didn't want out help, THEN DON'T CALL US! The last thing we want to do is get into a pissing match over right or wrong answers. This is Tech Support. We try different things in order to find the solution. The only thing your interjecting and arguing with us will do is serve to piss us off and make all of us very unhappy.  There's more than just these 5...but as they say, "Small Doses".... Keep tuning in for more.

      In the last 30 days, the Repair Dept. of the ISP I work for has gotten 350 computers in for repair (of them, only 4 were Macs). We get them for all kinds of repair issues, such as hardware problems, software problems, format & reinstalls, viruses & worms, and the ever wonderful 'Misc'. People don't generally get to see what we have to deal with on a daily basis. Thanks to Rod Shelley, you can see some  urlLink classic repair nightmares . From personal experience, I can say that some of them are rare...but some sadly are not.

      a few years ago techtv had mail server problems so the owner of the techtv yahoo group let them use it for their newsletters for a while and now that techtv is pretty much dead, the owner decided to make it a discussion list to talk about the demise of the network. Now there are people that don't remember signing up and can't read the little message on the bottom of each email so they're raising hell. It's so very amusing. It's over at  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/techtv/messages  if you'd like to see.

      This is a blog of my experiences at work doing desktop PC support. Through my job I encounter a ton of ID 10-T errors, and this will be my attempt to relieve frustrations by documenting some of them. Names will be left out for the safety of my job, but the experiences will be true. I hope this can bring some amusement to people reading it through my suffering. :)

      Sometimes I wonder what goes through the minds of the people I talk to at work. Take this conversation snippet for example:  Customer: "So the data will be intact?" Me: "That's right." Customer: "I watched this movie the other day..." Me: "...ok." Customer: "It was called 'Naughty Night Nurses'. There was this extremely beautiful woman who..." (Rest of the customer's comments omitted in order to keep this site family-friendly :P ) Me: "..." Me: "..." Me: "...so what's the percentage on that disk check?"  This one was doubly bizarre. First, he spins off insanely abruptly from the current topic. Second, the fact that he felt it was a good idea to discuss his favorite porn movies with me in the first place. This customer gets a good old fashioned "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot???".  This next one wasn't quite as bad:  Customer(female): "Has anyone ever told you, you have a really sexy voice?" Me: "Not really, but thanks." Customer: "Have you ever considered..." (whisper): "...phone sex?" Me: "Uh...no. As flattering as that is, we won't be going there."  I try to imagine what would possess a person to say things like this to a total stranger, but I can't wrap my brain around it.  We won't get into the crazy e-mail addresses people provide me as part of their contact information (One example: a KKK address. Seriously).  What ever happened to shame and embarrassment? Are these just examples of exhibitionism? Cries for attention?  My guess, just the general insanity that seems to be overly abundant among tech support customers.

      Sometimes a customer will do or say something incredibly stupid, but the really mind-boggling ones tend to not happen all that often. What really makes Tech Support difficult is the little stupid things that you experience with every call. A couple examples:  1 - You do NOT have to hit Apply before hitting OK. OK does the same thing as Apply, but it also closes the window. The only time you ever need to hit Apply is if you want to put the new settings into effect without closing the window. Almost every customer I talk to asks "Do you want me to hit Apply first?" when I ask them to hit OK. This isn't a problem localized to computer novices, either. Many of the people who do this have been using Windows operating systems for years.  2 - Computers are capable of multitasking, and shutting the computer down while programs are up isn't a bad thing unless you have unsaved data. If you have Internet Explorer open and I ask you to restart your computer, you do NOT need to shut down Internet Explorer first. This is another one that I get almost every call. Every time we go from one program or task to another, the customer asks "Should I close ________ first?" I've come close many times to saying "I don't give a damn. If I thought that needed to be closed, I'd have said so. Just do what I tell you to do!"  These kinds of things don't really cause problems with the computer, but they get extremely irritating, especially when they keep stacking up. Part of it is probably the fact that customers asking these types of questions are essentially second-guessing you, as if they assume you don't know what you're doing and need to be coached occasionally. This falls under the category of 'If you don't want my help/don't think I know what I'm doing, why did you call me?'. It's akin to asking a grocery store cashier "Remember, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies should go in their separate places in your cash drawer." People don't like being told by customers how to do their job. It's demeaning and insulting, and it doesn't make our job any more enjoyable.

      1)  Failure To Pay Their Bill  - Nothing is worse than a riled up customer going off on a rant in your ear about how they can't get online, only to find out they're not paying their bill on time. Not only does it set your mood in a downward spiral, but it embarrasses the customer when you type in their info just to discover what a slacker they are. (As chronicled in a  urlLink previous post. ) Some people get it, they call and ask to see if their account is still active. If they find out that it is indeed not active, they ask to be transferred to a billing rep. No embarrassment, no problem. But if their account is still active, then there's something else wrong, and we work on it. They aren't all worked up, and their displeasure level is much lower, and these calls generally work out okay. But as with all things good, they are few and far between.  2)  Calling For Non-Internet Related Support  - I get tons of these calls every week. The scope of support I am allowed to provide can only deal with Internet related problems. When users call me about Printer Issues, or why their mouse doesn't work, I have to politely tell that that I can't help them, and they should refer to another support line (if possible, I'll help them get the number to call). What's worse is when people don't like that answer, and continue to try to convince me to help them. I hate pulling out the "legal disclaimer", but sometimes I must. People, when I answer the phone with "Thank you for calling Internet Tech Support", exactly where in there does it say "And Hardware, and Games, and Printer Ink, and..."??  3)  Not Writing Down Error Messages  - Here's a classic exchange...  Me: Thank you for calling Internet Tech Support, this is Mike, how may I help you? Them: Yeah, I can't connect to your internet service, I keep getting an error message. Me: What does the error message say? Them: It says I can't connect to you. Me: What does it say *exactly*.... Them: ....I dunno. Me: Did you write it down? Them: No. Me: Okay, we're going to have to hang up so it frees up your phone line, and then I want you to attempt to connect. When you get the error message, write down *EXACTLY* what it says, including the error code number, that's very important. Then cancel the connection attempts and call me back with that info. Them: Okay. >click  Error messages are very important. They tell me what's happening. Error codes can direct me to more specific information. I tell all my customers to put a notepad and pen next to their computer so they can write down the information that appears on the screen. I have one customer who keeps a log of what's running, what time the errors occur, what the errors are and what programs he was messing around in when they happened.   I think it's obvious why I like this guy. His tech calls have not lasted over 15 minutes in 3 years.  4)  Calling 2 Minutes Before Closing  - This has to be almost as annoying as trying to help someone who's completely blitzed fix a computer problem. Why people wait until the end of the day to call with a tech problem, I'll never understand. And I guarantee you that anyone who calls at that moment doesn't have a simple problem to fix, either. These customers generally are the ones who require a full TCP/IP rebuild. Most often, I ask them to call back when there's more time. If I wasn't a single father, I'd stay a little later, but as is my lot in life, when it hits 6pm, I'm outta there.  5)  Not Calling About A Problem For Months  - This is a general gripe and is squarely the fault of lazy people. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why people will suffer through  months  of connection problems, and NOT call right away to get them resolved. They will instead just quietly curse our names and bad mouth us. Far be it from them to contact us when the problem begins (or at least within a week of it) and get it troubleshot and resolved. These people usually have a good rant built up over time, but here's a clue. If you don't call us, we can't tell that there's something wrong. We have a customer base of over 6000 people, and cannot track all of them. If you think we're going to notice one person having a problem out of all of that, you're smoking something highly illegal. We're not psychics. You need to call us RIGHT AWAY, not 3 months later to get things taken care of right.

      While there is software available for looking at a remote computer's desktop, almost all tech support does not use it, and would at the very least, require information necessary to connect to your computer. More and more, customers ask me early in the call if I can see their screen, and even when I say that I definitely cannot, it seems they assume for the rest of the call that I can.  Here's an example from today:  Me - Tap the F8 key after you start the computer, let me know when it's on an 'Advanced Options' screen.  - (sound of F8 key being tapped) Customer - Ok. It's on a blank screen right now  - (sound of F8 key being tapped)  - (sound of F8 key being tapped)   - (sound of F8 key being tapped)  - (sound of F8 key being tapped) Me - Is it still on the blank screen? Customer - No, it's on the 'Advanced Options' screen  - (sound of my head exploding)  If you don't tell us what's going on, we can't give you continued instructions. We have no crystal ball to divine what is occuring with your computer.  When you're dealing with tech support over the phone, the method of communication is VERBAL, which means you must speak or nothing will get done.

      The phone calls just keep pouring in today and it's become apparent that something's afoot. I fire up the old WeathermanX program on my iBook and look at the moon phase dates...  6/2 Full Moon  Well, now. That explains a lot.

      Many people don't realize how sensitive a telephone receiver is. Most phones these days come with a mute button, and it would be in everyone's best interest to learn how to use it.  Your tech support rep doesn't need to hear your conversations with co-workers about how cute but stupid your pool man is. If you absolutely have to verbally abuse your children/spouse/pets, please don't share the tender moment with us.  If you need to eat (and some of these calls can take a long time, so I understand), please don't chew within range of the receiver. Above all else, DO NOT take the phone to the bathroom with you. If you need to relieve yourself, that's fine, it's a normal function of the human body. But set the phone down while you do it, I don't need to experience it along with you. Taking me to the bathroom with you is one of the few things that earns an instant hang-up from me, and probably from others.  So when you're talking to tech support (or anyone, really) on the phone, please please try to be mindful of what sounds your phone is transmitting to the other person.

      1)  Calling While Intoxicated and/or High  - These are always 'fun' calls. Generally it can be difficult to understand what a customer is trying to describe when they're calling sober. But when they call slurring their words, ranting 15 times into my voice mail at 4am, or snickering and giggling from being high, it raises the bar on the difficulty meter. Also, if you're in this state, please don't move around. It has been my experience that the household furniture in said customers homes tends to jump out in front of them often. The sounds of a phone clattering on the floor and the various explitives uttered as a result are not any better than the afore mentioned yelling of "HELP".  2)  Using Incredimail®  - Nothing can irritate a tech more than when customers call complaining about a mail problem, and then it turns out to be the bug riddled, spyware program known as Incredimail. Why on God's green Earth this waste of electrons was ever created is beyond me. It mimics Outlook Express only in the most basic ways, but beyond that, it's a mess. And when it stops working, immediately, people want help getting their animated bouncy smiley crap back again. Email was NOT designed to be cute stationary with hearts and puppies and music and stuff. It was designed as a communication tool. Incredimail is about as useful as pink flamingos on the front lawn of a trailer home. And don't get me started on the connection between that and Tornados...  3)  Claiming they have a son/daughter/cousin/neighbor who's good 'at these computer things'...  - Folks, we don't care. Odds are, you've already had them look at it, and they either scratched their heads and couldn't help you, or didn't know enough to fill a bucket and attempted to fix it anyhow, and wound up messing it up worse. And simply put, they're not a factor now. If they were really as good as you claimed, you wouldn't have to be on the phone with us now, now would you!?  4)  Calling on a Cellular Phone/Digital Phone  - This is about as bad as calling in Drunk or High. Most users don't realize that about 90% of all tech troubleshooting doesn't need for them to be online. But instead, they assume the computer HAS to be online for us to get anything done, and so we attempt to put up with half words and dropped calls and static and God knows what else, asking the user to repeat themselves a half dozen time just to find out they have their password entered wrong. I've said this before, I'll say it again...Turn the computer on, do NOT go online, call from a landline phone! Celphone BAD! The only thing worse is if a user would call on a cel phone while drunk. (and that has happened)  5)  Screaming Babies and Barking dogs  - As a father, I understand that people with kids will have some noise in their life. It happens. I accept that. But when parent's call for tech support, and the call is constantly interrupted with the wails of a hungry baby or a dog that won't shut the hell up, it turns the moods of both the user and the tech very dark. Simply put, take care of priorities first, feed your kids, put them down for a nap, put the dog OUTSIDE, and then, when you have a moment of peace & quiet,  then  call Tech Support. Believe me, it will take half the time and your mood will be muuuch better in the long run.

      This is what was waiting for me in my Inbox this morning. Read it if you dare, but remember, if you get a pain in the front center of your head, similar to the pain experienced while eating ice cream too fast (brain freeze), slow down, read a comic strip and then come back to it.   For you advanced readers out there, try reading it out loud in Tele-Evangelist style. It's a "hoot".   TO: Michael/or Software Interpretor     From: Bonnie   Automated Report section looks impressive however the scope of it and the sequential clickings in order to establish one single context of a desired objective is not clear to me.   I have somewhat rummaged around, however I find I do not prefer bouncing around from screen to screen without a direction.  How does one obtain GUIDANCE ?  Does modem maddness offer this? or is this Internet teacher time?   In any event I would like Solar Power emails and any form from Lily Dale Assembly OFFICE so as to be able to communicate with them for convenience.  My email to them for the first time was blocked.  It was indicated that a form was suppose to emerge enabling me entry.  That had not resulted.  In any event the rest of the SPAM entries can be deleted.     I clicked on release for Solar Power and Forms thinking they would show up in the INBOX of my email.  Obviously it is not that simplified.  So obviously I am missing some steps here in order to retrieve desired mail.   Do you have a vocabulary - dictionary of interpretations of words used in automated report enabling me direction in choice selections, that I can print out and refer to for future encounters?   Irregular use of software programs does not permit ready recall plus aging, so I am requesting any supportive feedback to make this as painless as possible while not having to write email to tech support for mutual benefit.   Many thanks! EOM   I'm glad I have a 6-pack of beer waiting for me at home, especially after getting emails like hers. OY!

      Well a little kid was banned from a site I run the other day and didn't  like it so he's determined to bring us down. First attempt was during a  thunderstorm and I was at work. I blamed the outage on the storm since  that's normal. Tonight he decided to try harder and managed to  disconnect everyone from the chat by flooding it enough and overloading  the server. My connection was unaffected. My server didn't even die.  Soon everyone was back in. Strike two putzo. I also remembered a  setting for flooding and lowered the time for kicking someone for  flooding.       Why do people even try? I mean find somewhere else to go. We have  simple rules. You broke them. We don't want you around anymore. geez...

      This was a stunning conversation I had today, word-for-word:  Me: "Ok, select the latest date available" Customer: "Ok, that's in May." Me: "You don't have any more recent than that?" Customer: "Oh, more recent? Here's one in June." Me: "Ok, so the one in June is the latest?" Customer: "No, the one in May is." Me: "Sir...June comes after May" Customer: "Right, but you said the latest." Me: "...is June the latest, AKA most recent date available, or not?"  Three minutes of my life that I will never get back. There are two possibilities here: A) He doesn't comprehend that May is the month prior to June; B) He doesn't comprehend that in this context, the word "latest" is synonymous with "most recent". I almost have to dismiss A as a possibility right away because the man was able to dial his telephone, so he can't possibly be that stupid. This leaves us with B, but this isn't much better. I've never heard of anyone, anywhere, who thinks "the latest date" somehow means "the least recent". My mind is thoroughly boggled.
