       Today the day was going ok at the start mainly because kayla wasnt in casue she had collage.  In art it was really good i could properly talk to Annie and talk about some problems sofa is havin with oli.  In english i had a massive agruement with kayla and she is startin to annoy me i want to kill her.  In science i had a really kewl convo with damion and it was quite funny wot he was doin LOL.  At dinner i rand annie and asked her where she was and she said she will meet me at the gym.  She came down and she had kayla and dani and everyone else following them.  Annie came up to me and said she had just had an arguement with kayla and she told me to keep away from her.  So i got change and i came out and i could hear shouting from the LADIES changing rooms i was like WOMAN then i heard that kayla and annie are argueing and i was so annoyed i walked into the boys changing room and and punched the wall so hard my finger swelled up.  I got up to the red grar and i had a feeling that Annie wasnt talkin to me cause she doesnt want another arguement with kayla. So i was so depressed. It was our turn to bat and Annie came up to me and said she is talkin to me and SHE GAVE ME A HUG :O i was so happy now. So we have now both decided to ignore Kayla now.  I dont no what im goin to do tonight i mite go out if i aint grounded.  Bye for nowww xx
