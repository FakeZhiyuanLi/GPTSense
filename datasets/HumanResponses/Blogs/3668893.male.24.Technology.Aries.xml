      I am a sick man, I am a spiteful man, I think that my liver is diseased.  I will never know for certain how serious my condition is because I forbid myself from visiting any medical professional.  A great man once said that whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger; that may be the reason why I shy away from medicine.  It isn't that I don't respect the members of the medical community it is just that I wish to leave this world as soon as possible, for it is common knowledge that life isn't worth living anyways even if you grow in strength.  So why don't I take my own life? you may ask.  The only answer I could provide for that question is that I am a coward, and fear most every outcome to a decision, so I make a great effort not to make any decisions at all that produce an alternative to the status quo.  This may lead one to believe that I am quite content with the state of the world and that there is nothing to be done to improve the quality of collective life.  Not so!  I simply know that I, like most everyone else, am too feeble of mind to know what decisions would add to the benefit of mankind and which will be a detriment.  This is why I border upon non-existence, because I cherish these earthly things far too greatly to chance loosing them to a capricious whim.

      A menacing beast watched over me this morning during the rush hour drive to work.  Standing tall between the streetlights, its dark body and broad shoulders pierced the smoldering rain clouds.  Motionless, it beckoned me forward toward the land of filth and sin.  What torment and fear this creature inflicts upon me.  Am I the only one affected by the beast?  Has everyone else become desensitized to this monster?  I feel certain that some have even grown to love the over powering presence, to the point where they cannot leave his sight.  For me however, the only consolation comes when I retreat to the saftey of the indoors, but often even there is not secure enough for me, what truely aleves anxiety is the cold darkness of the underground.

      When would it be deemed appropriate for one to acknowledge complete defeat and sink deliberately into the depths of depression?&nbsp; I would assume that this would be apt when all alternatives have been exhausted and their is no sign of any progress.&nbsp; It is easier to discontinue hope if the goal to which you strive offers no tangible benefit.&nbsp; For example, if one strives to improve the world through altruistic deeds and that person percieves no positive change, then it would be silly to continue exuding effort fruitlessly.&nbsp; A common dream amongst most people of perception is to derive that singular truth, that would be the catalyst of all future progress, from the life that has shaped them.&nbsp; This is most often a futile goal to pursue, for there can be no singular truth besides change, which means that truth changes continuously.&nbsp; A common substitute for finding truth is the development of an original idea;&nbsp;something unique and novel that would be spawned from an individual.&nbsp; That pursuit of the original is a considerable driving force that brings about progress as well as regression.&nbsp; The creation of the original is the pure product of the soul.&nbsp; The development of an original idea proves to the creator that they&nbsp;are more than the sum of their parts and experiences, rather they become greater than themselves, an Ãœebermensch or Dostoyevsky's spiteful man.&nbsp; In spite of themselves they achieve a great feat, that of a purely original work.&nbsp; This is contrary to the scientific reasoning of today.&nbsp;&nbsp;How could a being, bound by limitations of space and time, create a work that excedes the very capabilities of the being itself.&nbsp; So if we honor the successes of science then we admit to ourselves that we are slaves to our environment and that no novel idea can be created by anyone.&nbsp; We then examine those supposedly novel ideas of the past only to recognize them all as regurgitations of environmental influences.&nbsp; So the hope that a soul exists, that we can rise above our own states and truely control our fate is no more than a childish dream.&nbsp; Our only recourse is to focus on those mundain tasks that satisfy those maslowian needs.&nbsp;  What if we fight against such an outcome, continue to strive for the original unceasingly, struggle to find the original?&nbsp; Many have tried and failed.&nbsp; J.R.R. Tolkien has created an entire world with its own languages customs, rituals, religions etc... However he has only adapted and/or merged already existing ideas into another.&nbsp; However, if we decide to imagine a unique situation, do we decide that the imagined situation&nbsp;be bound by the same laws that bind us?&nbsp; Wouldn't that be working within the realm of the non-original?&nbsp; So there is no hope for the original.&nbsp;&nbsp;The best&nbsp;we&nbsp;can hope&nbsp;to look forward to is Steven King like accomplishments, desperately attempting to create an original work through exploiting the monstrous.&nbsp;  This is why despair befalls me, the only goal that could redeem my existence is unreachable given the factors involved.&nbsp; This doesn't mean that I will discontinue my endeavors.&nbsp; I will still strive knowing full well that I may never reach my goal.&nbsp; Until then I must live the life of Sisyphus.

      An intimate relationship is an inhibiting force upon one's desires and goals.  Desires become second to those of your partner, goals get compromised due to conflicts of interests.  One would assume that in order to achieve person goals you must be allowed personal time independent of your partner, but ideally the partner should be one in which he or she complements the abilities to achieve the goals.  The ideal partner would be one which shares similar goals.  The success of a relationship is directly related to the achieving of the member's goals.  Incompatible goals would require both parties to work independently to achieve their personal goals, which is more difficult for the individual than working together with their partner.  Incompatible goals also infringe upon time that a person could spend with their partner.  It would be more advantageous for both parties in a relationship to cease the relationship altogether and search for a partner that shares similar goals.  Obviously there are many factors that would hamper this type of solution to a problem.  If a person is consumed by some affinity for a particular characteristic of their partner, then he or she may sacrifice their goals in order to sustain the relationship contrary to their advantage.  These people are lacking in will, they have a low self-esteem, and are committing to a life of servitude for a relationship.  They are sheep.  Why does a person sacrifice themselves for their relationship?  The partner often fulfills a role that has or will become absent.  For instance, a man sacrifices himself to sustain a relationship with a woman that has similar characteristics of his mother.  This is due to a fear of the unknown.  His mother's characteristics satisfy him and since he cannot fathom any other type of woman as being satisfying, he holds onto this substitute mother.  This Oedipus complex is a very common ailment that subjects so many to a life of misery.  People should be able to perceive themselves objectively, notice their faults, and correct them by any means possible.  This would ensure a satisfactory life.  But who am I to talk.  I am in love with a woman to the point that her absence causes me grief.  Even though I know fully well that I should behave differently and I make extreme efforts to change my actions, I am compelled to continue my relationship servitude.  I would hope that you still give me some respect, I only serve because I am served by her.  She worships me with equal fervor that I worship her.  There are times when the adoration blurs out of focus and the absence of completed goals comes to the head.  At these points conflict arises and due to the passion that we feel for one another a fight of extreme measure will surely result.  Since the force of passion attracts us together, when we have opposite views the passion throws us to opposite sides of the continuum.  Only a sacrifice on both parts can bring us back together, mainly by one party acquiescing and passion cooled down.  Even though a conflict is a damper upon the relationship, after it is resolved the relationship is bound to grow to a closeness and intimacy that was unachievable prior to the conflict.

      I come to work six days a week, work roughly fifty hours a week, and accomplish a net total of nothing.  I am told to write code to analyze tables of data containing millions of records indexed by a pin number and make predictions based upon past numbers of how well the company may perform within the coming week.  If my predictions are off, I am scolded and told to improve my forecasts, which brings me back to coding a program to analyze...  The performance is really due to the effectiveness of the salespeople, the weather, the time of year, attitudes of the prospects and a million other reasons that cannot be easily captured and measured to produce a trendline.  So I continue this cycle of creation, production, ridicule and destruction.  I will no longer complain about the futility of my cycle, for management has informed me that there are thousands of people that would be more than pleased to slip into my position.  My predictions will continue to be off most of the time, but I will survive by those rare days that my predictions are honored by chance, and that is all that is needed to keep the thread I am clinging to strong.  The only benefit working for my employer is the opportunity to explore the world without limits while I am waiting for queries to finish and reports to generate.  I can post blogs, read online material, and most importantly, pursue those aspirations that are not of a tangible benefit.   There is no window in my office, only a poster of the Chicago lakefront pinned to cork board.  I have a consistent buzz of white noise produced by a server behind me and a ventilation duct above me.  Outside my office is a copy machine that whines, clicks and purs from the time I arrive fifteen minutes late to the time I leave and hour and a half ast my scheduled departure.   I often wonder is what I experience at work would be considered sensory depravation.  Will I regress into a proto-human?  (Ha, a little Altered States humor... not funny... I know)  Seriously, the nine hours I am here a day seems to go by faster and faster.  I wouldn't have much of a problem with this characteristic of a work day if it only remained in the realm of the office.  Unfortunately this effect of sensory depravation is leaking into my personal life.  Each day I wake up and before I realise the significance of the day, it is time to go to sleep.  My only pleasure is Sunday, when I get to see my family and get caught up on all the negative aspects of their lives.  This can't last long.  I believe in Karma, and I have been a good person, for the most part.  I don't pollute, I am frugal and efficient, and my life's work is being as small of an inconvenience to everybody else as possible.  I pay my taxes...  Maybe that is the problem.  Could I be recieving punishment for my passive support of an administration that exploits human lives?  No, even though I say I believe in an underlying order, I really can't believe that rises above the biochemical levels when it is in regards to mankind.   I could start to make a greater effort to succeed.  I could become a better networker.  Call people that give me their business cards and chit chat about how their work is progressing, act interested in what they have to say, smile nod my head and say "really, that's interesting" over and over again until I am ready to vomit, only to swallow it and make another phone call, send another email, meet someone for lunch at a restaurant that serves hot bread and cold butter delivered to you by a hispanic that doesn't get a tip but rather the tip is destined for the gay waitor that pretends that he gives the smallest shit in the world about whether or not you want a slice of lime in your diet coke.  I could sacrifice my nights that I currently spend watching reality TV shows with my girlfriend, for nights filled with pretentious laughter, fictitious smiles and counterfeit friendships all with the sole purpose of obtaining a more lucritive position with their firm one day so that I can pay a daycare center to watch my kids while I go golfing with people that I curse during the night for stealing my time away from my kids.  Poverty is better...  Maybe one day I will give up the rat race and retire to a basement apartment where I can rue over my lack of ambition as a youth.  I can point the finger at the past for my problems in the present.  My dinner will consist of rice cakes and peanutbutter and a gin and tonic, that I will devour alone in my corner as I listen to the blood-curdling sounds of children fighting over who has the next chance to play a video game.   At least with poverty my day is my own, but I would let too many people down if I simply gave up the fight.  No, I will not let this happen.  Why should only the wicked enjoy the luxuries of life.

      As children we never realized that we were being attached to strings; the fun, games, television, arcades, and sports all provided enough distraction for us that we nnever noticed being bound.  The television provided us with a model for appropriate behavior and thought, our parents imposed upon us guidelines for beliefs, and school prohibited any deviation from the norm.  As we continue our "education" we become a manufactured product that serves a purpose in society.  We learn to desire expensive cars, clothes, toys, homes, etc...  We also learn that the meaning of life is to satisfy desire.  So when we choose our paths in life we take into account the satisfying of our desires and thanks to mass media those desires are prescribed for us.  We downplay our dreams so that we can fill that void of posessions that is most prevelant in the youth.  We committ our lives to the pursuit of a lifestyle that we feel destined to enter.  We ignore the temptation to do as we dreamed as a child because our society doesn't easily allow one to veer off the beaten trail.  It is a shame that in this common era, it is sneered upon to search for yourself.  Why reinvent the wheel they say.  But what if the wheel is flawed?  We will continue to travel with it until it is proven flawed, and nobody will prove the flaw unless they try to reinvent the wheel again.  With some ideas the reinvention of the wheel is pointless.  For instance, if we try to reinvent mathematics once again, or the foundations of logic, or even scientific method, there is probably little room for improvement.  Even though simple ideas may be sufficient there are complex subjects such as the God question, the nature of man, the role of society, government and they are all in dire need of revamping.  Unfortunately, there are social mechanisms to maintain the current order of things.  Lets try to imagine a revolution in an advanced society.  Rest assured, the rebels would be crushed; they would lack, numbers, supplies, information, support, propaganda, resources, to mention the least.  There is no changing the new modern governments from the outside.  It all must be accomplished from within, however, that will never happen because while a person works within the system to rise to a position of power they will be unknowingly brainwashed and corrupted ever so subtley.  They vicariously learn that conforming is beneficial and the contrary is disruptive to what the system considers progress.   How could there be progress with such adherence to the status quo?
