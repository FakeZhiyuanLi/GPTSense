      I drove my brother to the air port today.  Well.. first I got up.. went to work... came home.. stayed up all night.  Then drove.  96 to 275 to 94.   Easy.  25 min drive.  Left .. 6:00 am.  Arrived 6:25  Departure 6:28 Got back on 94.  Figured out I was in detroit around the time I allmost went to Canada.  Got on 96.  Drove a long while.  Blacked out somehow?  Was suddenly on 14 and didn't know it.   I looked at the sign to see what road it said.. couldn't read it, and said outloud what the damn road was.. evidently.. I knew.  I was right.  I was like wtf?  So .. I was nearly home.. going north .. then suddenly.. I was on some totally different road .. heading west.  Then I got on 23 going north.  Then 96 again on the other side .. Arrival: 7:36  Oh well.   I should probably sleep.  http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1088233245  I suck.   I r need $$$$

      Today was a very nice day indeed.   For starters.  I went out and picked up a new mountain bike with my brother.  After that.. we did 8 miles at a local metropark.  I had a Great time.  Work sucked as usuall.  I played a little thief to pass the time before going to bed.   Im just about there now.  Night night

      Hrm.  Im so tired I want to drop.  Im still up from my last post.  I sort of have a head ache.. but kinda not..   like a dull sort of pain that just sits there waiting to take advantage of any sort of weakness.  If I concentrate on it.   I can make it go away easily enough, but I kind of like it.  It is there to remind me that some choices I make .. are poor ones.  Honestly.   I did it for a girl that dosn't seem very interested in me.  I know inside it would never work.  But she is kinda fun to be around on occation.  I had a huge crush on her a few years ago... and now it's just like that head ache.  Oh well.

      It's 7:45 am.   I have to work at 10 am.  Why .. oh why.. am I still awake?  7:45 am is evidently a great time to start a blog.  Blog .. sounds kind of neutrally derogative.  Im tired.  Blah.  I know my boss is going to be a dick head if im late.  He can throw the biggest sissy fits.  What a baby.  I think his wife owns his ass he works to escape her.  That's so horribly depressing.

      I have been slacking.  Alot of things are going on these days.  Money lies at the core.  Love comes next.    Neither outlook looks very good.

      Lets get back into the swing of things.   Im sittin at my buddies house playing video games at the moment.   SWG to be exact.   SWG and beer.   SWG.. beer and breadsticks.  Life is good at times.   The little moments in between major events  .. when your just happy.   The happiness of being.   I dunno.   SO.   I reorganized my room.   Cleaned the majority of my house.  Rebuilt my computer.  My brother left for the boot camp, air force.  My father is finally home from Utah.. I think he's tired of living.. told me so today.   Anyways.   Im sure theres more.   But theres beer and video games.  Pranga
