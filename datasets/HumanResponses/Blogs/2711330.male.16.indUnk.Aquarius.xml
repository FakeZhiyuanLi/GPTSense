      Certain people don't have a link on this blog because, well, some of the material they post is not worth mine and other peoples time.  Now that may seem harsh but it's how I see it.  The people who do have links are the ones who post regularly or have interesting things to say.  I'm sorry but it's the truth.

      A post!  A post!  He's going to post!  I'm going to say what's on everybody's mind.  Or some of you at least.  Exams are near.  Stress, anxiety, and displeasure are running high.  People are complaining, griping, worrying, stressing, and even ranting about their exams.  Other people however don't seem affected.  Either they are confident with their knowledge or they know how to cope.  I like to think of myself as one of the latter.  I am confident with what I know but I study none-the-less.  Anyways, I know not of anybodies problems, concerns, or whatever.  I however am feeling happy at the moment and have been actually been feeling happy for most of the week.  If you got's no idea what I'm talking about then that's your petty issue so don't trouble me with it and just ask someone else.  Until the next time....

      I must say that I am amazed.  I have actually gotten positive feedback about this alternate blog.  I was expecting something more negative or at least numerous questions of why.  Not that I'm complaining.  I rather like the compliments.  Keep treckn' with those compliments.

      Well, well, well.  Look at that.  If you direct your attention to the chat box, McCall says his brain hurts.  Now since that's all there is to go on I'll just have ot assume that he's on drugs.  And alcohol.  And some other stuff.  Stuff that affects the brain.  Anyways, it's not my problem.  So McCall.  Clarification is much needed.

      This being the first post I will explain things.  This blog is different from my other blog which is mainly for how I feel or felt that day.  Instead this blog is mainly for talking about whatever topics I believe are worth talking about.  That means anything.  Be it news topics, school topics, or just anything around my life or other lives.  Anything is subject to scruntiny, critizim, or maybe some praise.  As of now I am just currently trying to get this blog setup and ready to go.  So nothing else will be posted until I can get things ready.

      Say goodbye.  As of Sunday I will be gone until further notice.  South Carolina's a fun place to be and that's where I'm heading.  I won't be dead and I know the dust will settle for a while but that stuff happens.  Even though I know today's Thursday this will be the last post for a while.  So there.

      This is for the record.  I am so sick of the way people treat me and think I just don't mind.  For those of you who even show some concern for me I commend you.  You are the people I live for.  For the rest of you who don't care about my welfare, well, forget you then.  You may not know if I'm talking about you but eventually you'll get the picture.  The way you talk to me (or don't talk to me) just confirms what I've said.  I'm so sick of the way people think they can act toward me one moment and then when they need me to do something for them they expect me to do it for them.  Your the kind of people who make me so mad I have to leave the room to keep from saying something extremely hurtful.  Your the people who I just wanna find and tell off.  Again, you may not know if I'm talking about you or not but eventually you'll get the picture.  So there ya go.  Like it?  I call it "A Look Into The Mind Of Joe And The Anger Contained Inside"  Don't like?  Tuff.  I'm not here to meet your every stupid whim.  In fact I could care less what you think.

      I am back from camp.  Since I have been away I know not of anyones or the worlds issues.  Since I am currently catching up on past news I am going to ask the lot of ya to post some problems to converse/talk/post about.  Until I get topics of conversational topics I will let this rest upon your mind:  What if Krispy Kreme made an Atkins doughnut?

      Havn't posted for the past week or so.  I've gotten pretty lazy with the posting but at the same time I've been busy with other stuff.  Like the papers, my house, the pool, and stuff in general.  More if you wanna hear it.  I don't care.  Time to go finish my Wild Cherry Pepsi.

      Say hello and goodbye again.  I'm back but will leave on Saturday for South Carolina once again.  During now and Saturday I will attempt to fill this space so as to amuse my peers and wipe away the dust.  So there.
