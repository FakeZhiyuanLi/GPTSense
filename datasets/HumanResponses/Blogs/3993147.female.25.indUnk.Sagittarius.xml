						   Yesterday someone told me that prodigious was the word of the day, and could I please attempt to use it. I have to admit it first struck me as a bit of a daunting task.&nbsp; A prodigious task, if you will. What, I thought, is prodigious in my life? Then, I was quickly reminded that I had a full plate of tasks to complete and I forgot about the request.   It wasn't until this morning, while sitting in a meeting, that I remembered the request and fully realized how applicable this word of the day is to my life. The definition is something "impressively great in size, force or extent; enormous: a prodigious storm; extraordinary; marvelous.   It seems that not only does this word apply to certain parts of my life, but it applies to almost every aspect of my life. How? Well, funny you should ask because I was just about to tell you.   I have a prodigious (miraculous) joy encompassing my life because of God and the unmatched consistency in His nature (immutability, self-existence, self-sufficiency, omnipresence, justice, infinitude, ect....).   I have a prodigious (colossal)&nbsp;sadness sitting in my heart over things going on around me.   I have the prodigious (monstrous) task of keeping up with the constant influx of new job responsibilities and titles that I receive on a daily basis.   I know so many people who have blessed me with their prodigious (anomalous) talents and gifts.   I am sure that if I had more time (remember the prodigious work load?) I could think of numerous other prodigious things in my life. But how thankful I am that I can say that! I did not sign up for a life of mediocrity. I signed up for a prodigious&nbsp;life, both good and bad.

						   Do you ever have those small epiphanies, like the time you realize you have been singing the wrong words to a song? The other night, I experienced a moment so enlightening that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp; I have taken on the daunting task of learning how to trade options. "It can't be that hard," you might say. Oh, you are wrong. So very wrong. You see, I seem to have some blockage in my brain when it comes to numbers. And as it turns out, options are numbers. All numbers.  So the other night I am having a private lesson on puts, calls, addition, subtraction, blah blah blah. About 2 hours into it, 10 profit and loss graphs later and an extremely patient teacher, it hits me. It hits me like a ton of bricks, and I start laughing.&nbsp; I laugh because I realize all these years later that I have to eat the words I uttered 11 years ago, sitting in my high school algebra class.  "I will never need to know this. There is nothing I could possibly go into that would require me to know algrebra."  Ha! No one can say that God doesn't have a sense of humor, because I know He was laughing the day I spoke those words.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   This is my first experience blogging, and I find it very strange that I am not really talking to anyone in particular.&nbsp; But, nonetheless, I like the idea of blogging.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it apropos to title this entry  Beginnings,  both because I am a first-timer, and&nbsp;because that seems to be an all-encompassing theme in my life right now. And so today, I&nbsp;celebrate new things.   A new blog  A new&nbsp;address - Chicago  New friends  New opportunities  New challanges  New sites  New joys  New sorrows  New lessons  New tears  And new depths&nbsp;in my relationship with God

						   I suppose that applies to my job too? Of course.  Today at work, in the middle of an extremely hectic day, one of my coworkers announced to the trade desk in a facetious tone that today is "Sarah's day to complain." I laughed and walked away, but it stuck with me.  I do not ever want to be the "complainer" in the office, or anywhere else for that matter. I want to be the one rejoicing in all things. I want to be the "smile" that walks around the office. I want to be thankful for my job, the good parts as well as the bad.  It makes me upset that someone even had the opportunity to see me complaining. However, I am so thankful that I have even noticed and been bothered by this. Some small proof that God is indeed completing the work He started in me. Praise God that He is faithful. Praise God that we really can rejoice in our weaknesses.  Back to work.

						   Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing. In all things give thanks.  Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, in prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.  Why?  The peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  With thanksgiving. In all things give thanks.  Maybe in my struggles, I should start giving thanks as I beg God for help. Maybe I should rejoice in each situation, knowing that God is in control and He will use this to refine me. Today He is using my present situations to show me how much I fail daily in following Him, in trusting Him, in being obedient to Him.  I am learning a lot about myself. I am learning how God has built me to truly thrive on relationships, and when one is hurting, it physically affects me. I am learning that I have been so busy that I forgot what it is like to sit and listen to God. I am learning how scary it is to think I may actually be missing what He has to say.

						   On Sunday at Harvest, James MacDonald spoke about relationships. I Peter 3: 8-?. He was talking about how difficult they are to maintain. Be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, ect... Sure. Of course. It makes perfect sense, and while hard, it is doable. But what about my relationships with those who don't live by the same rules I live by? Those who don't believe Jesus is the Christ and therefore live their lives according to a different world view.  I am realizing that in this world, very few people actually look at things the same way I do. Talk about feeling like a fish out of water. Everything I do and say is completely foreign and bizarre to my new friends. It is like trying to live life with people who don't even speak the same language. I suppose we could just smile and nod and pretend that we have great relationships, but in attempting to go deep and learn each other's languages, I am finding seemingly insurmountable roadblocks. It is tiring. It is frustrating. It is lonely. It makes me want to cry. And the worst part is that I feel lost. I feel like I don't know the appropriate way to respond. I want to explain my heart and my reasons for why I do what I do, but I don't know if they would understand if I tried.  These relationships make me thankful for those who are cut from the same cloth. They make me wish these people were on the same page. They make me long for home, where sinful people do not mess up simple processes like communication.

						   On August 3rd, 2004, my little Kulialeilani (wreath of heaven), met Jesus face to face.  She is home. She is where she is completely loved and understood, in the all consuming presence of her maker. She finally got to go home.  I wonder what it was like, the moment she saw Him. I wonder if she knew that she had just completed a battle most would never be brave enough to fight. I wonder if she realized that she no longer felt the pain that had racked her body for so long. I wonder how significant her cancer was in her mind at that moment. Perhaps she was so consumed with Jesus, her life and source and being, that every ounce of her thought was wrapped up in Him. I wonder what He looks like, what He smells like. I wonder how good it feels to be enveloped in His arms.  I have so much to process now that she is gone. It is painful, and that amazes me. It amazes me that God made us such relational beings that we can physically hurt because we miss someone so much. I am not sad for her because I know she is finally experiencing the fullness of all she ever longed and hoped for. But I am sad for me, because I miss her. I am sad for her family because they have to go on without her now.  When I am ready, I will write more about her. More about her life. More about her heart and her smile. More about her battle. More about the privilege I had of joining her on this journey.
