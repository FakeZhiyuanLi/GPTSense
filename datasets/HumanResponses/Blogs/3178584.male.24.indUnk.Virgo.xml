      It almost impossible to watch TV without seeing some footage or mention of the war in Iraq.  Its funny because just last year around this time, Americans were gong ho about the war in Iraq.  American flags were every where, patriotism was at an all time high, people were volunteering to go to Iraq, it actually looked as if it was a war the US could win.      Now a year and 700+ lives(and counting) later, the reality of war and bad decisions are starting to come to light.  No WMD have been found and now Americans want answers as to why soldiers are being killed daily.  However, President Bush still thinks an army for 120,000+ soldiers can control/conquer a nation of 20+ million people.

      So today I'm in a restaurant, and this dude's phone rings while he is eating.  So he  answer and start a conversation about rims(of all things, LOL), then proceeds to talk about he has the hottest 22" and how much he paid for them. Mind you he has a mouth full of food and is loud as hell, around other restaurant patrons.    In my opinion this is another senseless act of a negro acting like a nigga.  First of all, who talks loud with a mouthful of food in a restaurant???  Secondly, who cares how hot your rims are and how much u paid for them???  Now if I'm a black man witnessing this, what do u think a white person is saying to themselves??  This is what I could imaging them thinking:  "There goes another nigger talkin bout those sprewell's."   "Why is this nigger so loud(on the phone) while I'm trying to enjoy my meal."  Its bad enough (some)white people think most Negroes are niggas(ers), but when black people decided to do stuff like this it just adds fuel to the fire.   *The reason I named this part I is because I'm sure I will witness many more acts of Negroes acting like niggas:(

      In more ways than one. Chess is a game that requires you to think before each move, all facts and circumstances must be weighted before that move is made.  Any move can compromise a important piece and/or cost you the game.  And the most interesting thing about chess is that no two games are the same.  People tend to take on characteristics of certain chess pieces as well. The Pawn, for example, is the less valued piece on the board, can only move forward one space at a time and is often the first sacrificed, but on the flip-side every pawn is capable of becoming a queen if utilized the correct way. So the moral of this story is, think wisely before you make decision(moves), because ever decision(move) determines how your life(game) turns out.

"Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve SIsters work hard, bitches work your nerves Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids Bitches in street with their nose in your biz Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live Bitches have niggers all up in your crib Sisters tell you quick "you better check your homie" Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie Sisters love Garry cuz they know how 'G is I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch"  Jay-z, "Sisters and Bitches" Blue Print 2, 2002

       All we got is Drugs, Sports and Entertainment.......    If you were a alien from outer space sent to study the black culture in todays society, you probably think all black's have is drugs, sports and entertainment.  If you turn on the tv at any time of the day i'm sure you will find the great majortity of black faces shucking and jiving on videos or comedy shows(BET), playing sports(ESPN) or wanted for a crime on the news.   Just off hand, the hottest tv shows(that come to mind) currently airing that featuring blacks are: Making the Band, College Hill, Dave Chapelle Show, NBA playoffs, ESPN sports center, Comic View, 106 and Park. None of these shows portray blacks in a positive manner, in my opinion. So what image does that portray to the tv audience??? and more importantly what examples does that set for our young black youth?   Don't get me wrong i watch a few of the shows and think/know they are very entertaining any adult would or should know that as well, but what does a child think when he/she see's a 18 fresh out of high school that didn't goto college making millions of dollors?? What does that 14 year old girl think while she is dancing to "shake it like a salt shaker"?

      I just want to address two fads that everyone seems to doing these days:  Stripped Button-down shirts  Since Jay dropped the  Black Album  you can't go anywhere without seeing guys wearing stripped button down shirts. I promise if I see one more dude with a stripped shirt and Air Force one's on I'm going to scream, LOL.  I went out last night and I promise about 85% of the dudes had on stripped shirts but only 5% were wearing the shirts correctly(in my opinion).  I think that if a button down shirt is going to be worn, it should be worn a certain way.  Button downs should not be worn with sneakers(Air Force One's in particular) or Timbs, they simply serve the shirt no justice. They should only be worn with loafers, "lace up's"(diesels, Cole Hann, Kenneth Cole) or dress boots(slightly square toe properly).  You should keep the jewelry simple(and classy). A nice timepiece and/or bracelet is all thats needed.  If u are going to wear a extravagant("Bling-Bling") watch or bracelet, make sure its real and that Jacob made it himself, LOL.  Jewelry such as long chains, spinners, Jesus faces and crosses, etc. Should not be worn, they look out of place with a casual button down shirt.  If cufflinks are going to be worn, make sure they are a descent pair.  And what really blows me is when fitted hats and dew tags are worn with button down shirts.  Just b/c you have on a green and white stripped button down does not mean u have to wear a Celtics fitted with a white dew rag underneath, it looks foolish and your not in a video like usher or jay, LOL.   "political t-shirts"  Everyone is wearing "political t-shirts"(Che, Angle Davis, Black panthers, Malcolm X/Martin), but if you are going to wear political t-shirts please know about who is on your shirt and what they stood for.  It amazes me how many people I see with Che t-shirt on, the other day when I was in the mall and I glanced in "up against the wall" and saw at least 6 different Che t-shirts and people were buying them.  Many of them probably don't even know he was born Ernesto Guevara in Argentina and was a doctor(med degree) before joining Castro with the revolution.  But I'm sure they know jay-z wore a similar shirt on his unplugged concert and that its a cool shirt to have these days.  How are you going to have on a shirt with Malcolm and Martin on it but yet hustle and degrade women, that goes totally against what they stood for, go figure.

      Just a few random quotes I'm feeling:  "The common goal of 22 million Afro-Americans is respect as human beings, the God-given right to be a human being. Our common goal is to obtain the human rights that America has been denying us. We can never get civil rights in America until our human rights are first restored. We will never be recognized as citizens there until we are first recognized as humans."  Malcolm X   "Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity." Martin Luther King   "If the United States of America or Britain is having elections, they don't ask for observers from Africa or from Asia. But when we have elections, they want observers." Nelson Mandela     "He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life."  Muhammad Ali   "Racism is not an excuse to not do the best you can." Aruther Ashe   "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others. . . . One ever feels his twoness,â€”an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warrings ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." W.E.B. DuBois   "Black people have always been America's wilderness in search of a promised land." Cornel West   "People pay for what they do, and still more for what they have allowed themselves to become. And they pay for it very simply; by the lives they lead." James Baldwin

      As a black man, I believe that there has been a plan in effect to control and destroy black men in America. The plan has been in practice for nearly 400 years.  The effects of this plan is visible in everyday society, the most recent has come to light.  Before talking about this effect, I would like to do a quick overview of the stages of the plan that led up to it.   I view slavery as the initial stage of the plan.  With slavery Africans/Blacks men(as well as women) were completely stripped of all human dignity(free will, religion, culture, language, etc), and forced to assimilate what the "master" deemed appriorate.  "Masters" also made black men sexually inferior by taking black women as contraband.  As a result the gene pool was also polluted(ex:mulattos) and a system of color superiority/inferiority was put into play to divide slaves and create a sense of self-hatred.    After slavery ended, the second stage began with "legalized slavery" (better known as imprisonment) which is a result of a (sometimes) biased justice system.  The bulk of the prison population is of black males. Eventhough prison is the end result of choices they made, it still serves as a form where men(blacks most importantly) are being (legally)enslaved mentally as well as physically. In essences it forces some children to be raised without a male figure in their lives, which (can)create an on going cycle of fatherless children. Many black men that are imprisoned often become institutionalized, they can become depended upon a system and set of rules that can make their transition back into society harder.  Imprisonment also legally disenfranchise inmates, upon release(if released) convicts are unable to vote, purchase a firearm, in some cases they must register with a parole board and deters them from obtaining adequate work b/c of their criminal record.  Therefore, they turn back to a life of crime(in many cases) and either end up dead or back in jail.  Homosexuality is another effect of imprisonment, many times black men return home as homosexuals as result from being locked up with men 24/7 for prolonged periods of time.  But the third stage of the plan is just a spin-off of the second stage, that takes place upon release from prison.  This stage has been a often overlooked effect of imprisonment, but has recently come to light and has been receiving nation attention.  Its being hailed as a "sick sexual practice" among black men.  This practice may prove to be the most deadliest effect of the plan, that may be the ultimate blow to the black community.  This practice is known as Down Low(DL), which is when a black man practices both homosexual and heterosexual behavior(bisexual) with out notifying the female party of their homosexual tendencies.  It is a common practice(in prison) for "straight" men to have sexual encounters with other men(homo or hetero) and not be looked at or labeled as homosexual.  Therefore, upon release some men continue the practice and refuse to call themselves bisexual or homosexual, but rather still view themselves as heterosexual and sleeping with both men and women.  This practice has caused a significant rise in the HIV/AIDS(and other STD's) cases within the black community, by creating sexual triangles that puts everyone in danger.   So with that said, this plan will continue to evolve and grow into new stages, most unknown to the average person, but will advance secretly nonetheless.

      A friend of mine chose to answer the questions to my May 5 post, check them out:  Why aren't ALL able black people voting? This is a very good question. On February 3, 1870, African American men were granted the right to vote per the 15th Amendment. However, the grandfather clause made most of them ineligible. If you could not pass a literacy test, you could not vote. How many BLACK men knew how to read in 1870? And if they did, how many lived to tell about it? So, it wasn't until almost 1965, (95 years later and a LONG HARD STRUGGLE), that African Americans could exercise their right to vote. I can go on and on about the history of voting, because it is VERY long. This is history that I can cherish and appreciate. ALL black people don't appreciate what has been done for them to exercise this divine right. Because they don't appreciate the struggle, they don't feel it's important. Voting is much bigger than "who is running", or "who is going to win". Voting is exercising an inevitable right and being heard. Blacks need to realize that our vote does count. In the year 2000, 51% of black registered voters actually voted. Of course we know there were issues in 2000, but this 51% needs to turn into 91%. We need to let our voices be heard or forever hold our peace.  Why are there more black men in prison than in college? Prison=Profit. The penal system generates more $$ then promoting formal education. THEN, we have people graduating from college only to find it's hard as hell to find a job. So, you have people looking at that and think "why should I go to college to struggle". I agree with most people when they say, "college is not for everybody", but I also believe that you don't know until you try. Black men have no sense of patience. SO, they feel that they have to do something fast to get money and land their behinds in jail! We have rappers like Kanye West promoting the fact that he dropped out of college. So, some men feel that they can do the same and be the next Kanye. But, they fail to realize that what Kanye did took a lot of hard work and ambitious, which is the same thing it takes to get a degree. Nothing is easy is this world!  Why are some many "babies having babies"? Because parents are too busy being their "friends" and not parents. We need to teach our girls that there is more to life than boys and having sex. And if they're going to do that, PROTECT yourself!  Why are black women being degraded and exploited on TV? Because some black women are degrading themselves in real life! Plain and Simple!  Where is Jesse?(LOL) Trying to gain clout by saving some POWS (LOL)  When did nigga become a term on enderment? This happened when we got extremely comfortable with this term. Just like women call each other B*T*HES. We don't understand the dynamics that goes with this word. It is very important that stop identifying ourselves as NIGGAS, but as people of color. I suggest that we look this word up in the dictionary (before they take it out) and reflect.  What is AIDS and why is it destroying the black community?  A=Acquired I=Immune D=Deficiency S=Syndrome  This is destroying our community because we're not protecting ourselves! Plain and Simple. We are not teaching and protecting our children! Sex should be safe, not deadly. With men being on the down low rising, so is the rate of black women and men catching AIDS. Let's not forget the dirty needles! PROTECT yourself and be honest about who you are! NOBODY is worth your good health or life!  How and why did America allow another Vietnam to happen? We're big, bad, arrogant, rich, nobody can touch us America. You know why, because we'll send all of "brave" men to fight for us and if they die, we'll give their wife and kids an AMERICAN FLAG! BUT, they have to pay for the cute little box to put in. THEN, they can hand it on their wall to remember their husbands and dads by. All of this happens while the WHITE house is occupied by our "leader", who is sound a sleep at night because he know where his kids are (probably getting drunk)!!!  The answer were taken from http://youthfulwisdom.blogspot.com/ Thanks for the input Dani:)

      I know everyone has that friend(s) that's always advocating supporting "black owned" businesses and labels.  Many times I have gotten the "don't buy Banana Republic b/c you are making the white man richer" speech from friends.  They would prefer or rather you to buy/support Rocawear, Phat Farm or G-unit b/c those are label deemed "black owned" than to sell out and buy Gap or Kenneth Cole.  People use the world "black owned" too loosely these days, they use it as if 100% of the profit is going solely to a black person and a white person is not seeing any of the money.  But what some people fell to realize is that businesses require capital(tools) and finacial backing to function as business, and in today's society whites posses a great majority of both of them.  Take any of the "black owned" clothing labels(ex:rocawear), they may be started by and operate by a black person, but:  Who Financed the loan to upstart and keep the business functioning?  More than likely a bank owned and operated by a white of directors  Who owns the property that houses the business? More than likey a realtor company owned and operated by a white person  Who owns the textile copy that provides material for the clothing? More than likely a company owned by a white or foreign person   Who owns the shipping/distribution company that transports the clothing?   More than likely a business owned and operated by a white person  So their is no way of cutting out the "white man" when it comes to business, therefore, in my opinion there are no true "black owned" business and either way you look at it a white person is going to profit, LOL.  It like Kanye said " Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack. And a white man get paid off of all of that "

        What would Martin and Malcom say about the status of (Black)America today?  Thats something we will never know, but I'm sure there are a few questions they would have.  Here are the question I could imagine them asking:  Why aren't ALL able black people voting? Why are there more black men in prision than in college? Why are some many "babies having babies"? Why are black women being degraded and exploited on TV? Where is Jesse?(LOL) When did nigga become a term on enderment? What is AIDS and why is it destroying the black community?

      The other day a friend and I were talking about growing up, during the conversation I had mention how my parents were still together.  He then proceeded to called me an "uppity crust nigga/cosby kid" which I thought was funny and took as a joke, then he went on to explain his reasoning as to why he called me a "uppity crust nigga/cosby kid." He brought up some very interesting facts that I often take for granted and never thought about.  The most interesting being was the fact that I was raised by both of my parents, who are still married(together).  When he said that I was quickly reminded that out of all my close friends I am the only one who was raised by both of my parents.    He also pointed out the fact that I was raised in a four bedroom house(which he found hilarious considering the fact that I am a only child, LOL) in a middle class suburban neighborhood.    I am not ashamed or cannot apologize for who I am or how I was raised, but it just shows me how blessed and fortunate I am.  The conversation made me realize that the things that are just a part of someone's life and that may be taken for granted, are things that others would love to have.

      Its almost impossible to turn on the TV or radio with out seeing or hearing Kanye West, he is everywhere, LOL.  I ain't mad at him though, I actually like and respect him as an artist.  I like and appreciate the fact that he really doing his own thing when it comes to his music and style.  Being the "prep" that I am, I'm really feeling his style, even though he has thug wannabees trying to be preps, its funny to see thugs actually going in to Express Men or BR looking for blazers and striped shirts, LOL...lmao,but to shall soon pass, LOL.

      The following is something I found, it's very thought provoking.       I was chillin at the crib and there was a knock at the door. I opened  the door and to my amazement there stood Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He  was dressed exactly the way they dressed in the 60's. You know with the suits and the thin neckties, only he was in black and white like an old movie and the rest of the world was still in color. He explained to me that he had been gone for quite some time now (over 35 years) and was lost. He said that the world had changed so much and hoped that I  could help him get reacquainted with our society so he could find his way  back to his family. I invited him in and told him to make himself comfortable When Martin sat in front of my entertainment system, he asked me about all the contraptions connected to my television set. I explained that one was my VCR and one was my DVD player. Martin asked," What's a VCR?""What's a DVD?" I explained both technologies to him and he wasastonished. Then he asked about the third box. I told him that was my cable box. Based upon the confused look on his face, it was apparent that this too needed explaining. I turned on the television and after a brief description and instruction on the use of the remote control he was off clicking from channel to channel. After a few minutes, Martin was working the remote like a pro!  Being a man made it real easy for him to fall in love with the remote control. He was very impressed by the fact that there were so many channels geared towards specific interests, sports especially (ESPN). He continued further and eventually stopped at one of the music channels that were airing their hip-hop program. Dr. King asked, "What is this?" I explained that it was a music video and that's the way today's music is presented to the public. As one thuggishly blinged out video after another was aired, I noticed a cease in questions. Martin was silent and his facial expressions changed from amazement to distress and disappointment. He asked. "Is this what our music has come to? Is this supposed to be progress?" "Why do our women condone this obscene portrayal of their womanhood? Have they forgotten the abuse, emotional and physical rape that their female ancestors had been subjected to? And why do our young men act this way? Obsessed with materialism and being disrespectful to our women?" I told him its called, "thuggin". He asked me to explain what thuggin was. I said, "It means to be hard and unfeeling? uh you know? a gangsta ? ride or die? cash rules everything Having no respect for anything or anyone. Any negative quality about a man.   After several strange looks from Martin, I then realized that therewas no way to explain or justify "thuggin" to an intelligent person likehim. So I changed the subject. Abruptly Martin asked, "Could anyone else see these videos?" Anyone who pays for cable, I replied. "You mean to tell me that you actually pay money willingly to witness this?"Martin asked. I could only answer yes, but I felt ashamed to admit this to such a righteous man. Martin asked, "Is this behavior accepted by everyone? Where have all the ministers, pastors and leaders gone?" I told him, there haven't been any who are willing to step out there and put it on the line since you left here. Martin said very sadly, "I never worried about leaving here because I was so sure that there would be more who would come after me to step up and carry on the fight for equality and respect. Martin becoming more and more disgusted watching the videos being aired stood up and said, "This is how we overcame? He grabbed my cable box, ripping it from the back of the T.V., and smashed it on the floor. Being who he was and knowing deep down he was right, I couldn't get mad. As we stood there looking at the wreckage that was once my cable box with an awkward silence, Martin then apologized and asked could we please leave because he just wanted to see his family. "Is there any place that I can go to get some gifts for my family?" Martin asked.   I knew just the place. We got in my car and headed to the mall. Dr. King was fascinated by the size of the mall and selection of different stores. It must have been a weekend because as we started twalk around, I noticed that the mall was filled predominately with teenagers. Many of them were loud and using profanity. Martin asked a young brother in front of a group of his friends why is it necessary to be so profane and conduct himself in way that was not only disrespectful to himself but to his people. The young brother said,"F---- you man! Ni**a, you ain't my daddy! I had to restrain Martin from disciplining the young brother. I asked the teenager, "Do you know who this is? He replied, "Hell naw, he ain't iced out so why should I care. At this point I was ready to snatch my man up, but Martin urged me to let it go. After Dr. King was able to calm down, he realized that the young people were only imitating what they saw on the music videos that he had seen earlier. "They have been infected with the ignorance of the images they covet. So this is our future?" I suggested that we just get the gifts and go. As I started to walk further, I noticed Martin walking back towards the door that we came in. I ran after him, shouting," Whoa, where are you going?" With a distressed look Martin said, "I'd rather go back."Why?" I asked. He said, "You don't' understand, I never got to see my kids grow up. I missed the holidays, graduations and birthdays, all in the name of sacrifice. I felt it was necessary to bring about equal opportunity and a brighter future for this generation. All I see is that a few of us got rich and the rest became slaves again." I said, "What are you talking about, this isn't slavery!" Martin  looked at me and replied, "Oh it isn't?" He turned and walked towards the  doors and exited the mall.   I tried to keep him from leaving but out of nowhere this security guard gets in my way and tells me that I can't go with him. I wrestled myself away and bolted out of the exit but once I got outside he had vanished. As I stood outside panning the parking lot to see if I could find him, a Escalade on 24's bumpin some ignorant thug anthem wa coming right at me. All I could do was brace myself for the impact. Right before the SUV hit me, I awoke out of my dream.   As I laid in a puddle of sweat, I tried repeatedly to shake the dream but I couldn't.  I remembered those who sacrificed their lives for us and I wondered what  itwould be like if we had to stand before them and justify what we have  become as a race. I also wondered what made me have such a dream.  Afterhours of thinking, I concluded it was probably guilt. The guilt of  knowing that we have fallen way short of Martin Luther King's dream. In fact it's closer to a nightmare!

      Here is a very sad but true article that i found on a messege board.   THEY ARE STILL OUR SLAVES    "We can continue to reap profits from the Blacks without the effort of physical slavery. Look at the current methods of containment that they use on themselves: IGNORANCE, GREED, and SELFISHNESS."     Their  IGNORANCE  is the primary weapon of containment. A great man once said, "The best way to hide something from Black people is to put it in a book." We now live in the Information Age. They have gained the opportunity to read any book on any subject through the efforts of their fight for freedom, yet they refuse to read. There are numerous books readily available at Borders, Barnes &Noble, and Amazon.com, not to mention their own Black Bookstores that provide solid blueprints to reach economic equality which should have been their fight all along), but few read consistently, if at all.    GREED  is another powerful weapon of containment. Blacks, since the abolition of slavery, have had large amounts of money at their disposal. Last year they spent 10 billion dollars during Christmas, out of their 450 billion dollars in total yearly income (2.22%). Any of us can use them as our target market, for any business venture we care to dream up, no matter how outlandish, they will buy into it. Being primarily a consumer people, they function totally by greed. They continually want more, with little thought for saving or investing. They would rather buy some new sneaker than invest in starting a business. Some even neglect their children to have the latest Tommy or FUBU, and they still think that having a Mercedes, and a big house gives them "Status" or that they have achieved the American Dream. They are fools! The vast majority of their people are still in poverty because their greed holds them back from collectively making better communities. With the help of BET, and the rest of their black media that often broadcasts destructive images into their own homes, we will continue to see huge profits like those of Tommy and Nike. They'll continue to show off to each other while we build solid communities with the profits from our businesses that we market to them.    SELFISHNESS , ingrained in their minds through slavery, is one of the major ways we can continue to contain them. One of their own, Dubois said that there was an innate division in their culture. A "Talented Tenth" he called it. He was correct in his deduction that there are segments of their culture that has achieved some "form" of success However, that segment missed the fullness of his work. They didn't read that the "Talented Tenth" was then responsible to aid The Non-Talented Ninety Percent in achieving a better life. Instead, that Segment has created another class, a Buppie class that looks down on their people or aids them in a condescending manner. They will never achieve what we have. Their selfishness does not allow them to be able to work together on any project or endeavor of substance. When they do get together, their selfishness lets their egos get in the way of their goal. Their so-called help organizations seem to only want to promote their name without making any real change in their community. They are content to sit in conferences and conventions in our hotels, and talk about what they will do, while they award plaques to the best speakers, not the best doers. Is there no end to their selfishness? They steadfastly refuse to see that TOGETHER EACH ACHIEVES MORE (TEAM) They do not understand that they are no better than each other of what they own as a matter of fact, most of those Buppies are but one or two paychecks away from poverty. All of which is under the control of our pens in our offices and our rooms. Yes, we will continue to contain them as long as they refuse to read, continue to buy anything they want, and keep thinking they are "helping" their communities by paying dues to organizations which do little other than hold lavish conventions in our hotels. By the way, don't worry about any of them reading this letter, remember, 'THEY DON'T READ!!!!

      I know its been a minute since I posted, but thought i would just post a verse I heard today while listening to my MP3's:   " Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism, leaves most niggaz dead or in prison "   Jeru the Damaja Return of the Crooklyn Dodgers, 1995   I've heard this verse many times, but just today I realize what was really being said.  It made me think about how much hate there is toward people of color in this world, particularly africans and people of african decent.  European colonialism carved up the continent of africa, raped it of its natural resources(oil, diamonds, gold, etc.), kidnaped it's people and more recently stood aside and watched as the continent is being destroyed by tribal warfare, genocide(Rwanda) and AIDS.  And as for Subliminal hypnotism, just turn on the TV, like i have mentioned before the only in previous posts, more that likely the only programs you'll see blackfaces on 1 of 4 type of programs:  1. Playing ball on a sports program 2. Thuging/dancing/degrading black women on videos 3. Shucking and jiving comedy shows or movies 4. Wanted for a crime or looking ignorant while giving a statement on the news  All of which present subliminal(negative) images to (black)viewers:(

      There are a few things in today's society that I am really starting to question and making me wonder what's REALLY going on???  unplanned/teen pregnancies  This is a phenomenon I can't figure out, I know there are different cases and circumstances for everyone. And not everyone believes in abortion, but I would think in today's society everyone would believe in contraceptive or be more responsible.  Condoms are sold in all drug stores and are free at clinics, and birth control in available(even to the uninsured).  So I don't see why there is such a high rate of teen/single mother/unplanned pregnancies.  AS far as teens go, I understand that parents cannot be with their children 24/7, but I would think they would talk to their children about contraceptives and/or safe sex.  And I know that "mistakes" do happen sometimes, but how can a grown women or man make the same mistakes 2 or 3 times over.  You would think after making a "mistake" once they would get on birth control or be faithful users of condoms.     Lack of education  Last time I checked public schools were free to everyone in this country, but yet there are still people to this day that can't read or write and don't have a high school diploma.  I don't understand how people can chose to drop out of school in the 11th grade, you only have a year left!!!  And even if your a slow learner they have FREE programs in public schools that can help you.  So in my opinion there is no excuse for anyone not to have a high school diploma and/or to be illiterate, when education(k-12) is free to everyone in America, regardless of their race, gender, SES or religion.
