      I was watching the news just now, and how i again, ponder about life...  Accidents come without u even thought bout it...By then, it will be too late to avoid it..  Within 6 weeks, 3 industrial accidents were reported here..Seeing the victims' family and friends really somehow, broke my heart...  Imagine, you are one of them..being the victims' family or friends, seems like the world is tumbling down and it is defnitely not in favour of u.   Seems like majority of them who were involved in these accidents are foreign workers..MAkes me wonder at times..ok, sure there's compensation for the loss of the loved one, but can that compensation be a replacement? Off course, compensation $ is a big sum...The Bangladeshis, their loved ones back in India..left their loved ones for the 'lucrative' job in other countries...no doubt, locals in that particular country will not want that 'lucrative' job as described by the the Banglas, for eg cos it's nt  lucrative at all, its an odd-job labour..As from what I hear n know, these ppl who seek jobs miles away from their homes got to sell whatever they've got..just for paying the agency's fees..Thus, families left with a meagre amount of money, definitely...hoping for their 'heroes' to bring better income so that they can live out of poverty one day...It's like going to the war, to my opinion...u will not know if you are bound to see these 'heroes' back again in one piece..I am imagining how will the families react when they come to know bout the death of their 'heroes'....It will be utterly shocking for them..Full with regret and misery..how about their kids? what will be of them? What will be the future..It's really sad to just imagine what will their lives be...its much more painful to bear n face the future for these families...  A cousin met with an accident...a good man, who was on the way back to home sweet home after work from driving goods in Msia..5 kids..the eldest being about 20 by now...the wife's a housewife..Life changed for the family..last i hear, the wife remarried, but life wasnt simpler...and her eldest daughter is very rebellious..All are unexpected..cos the loss of their loved one is definitely a shock for them till now..Stress, Sad...the future is bleak...what more can they look forward to?   Losing a loved one is tragical, i must say...it happened to me, although it's been close to 6 years since, at times, I am still unable to accept the fact that Ayah is in another 'world'....Losing your loved one, is painful...the pain cant be alleviated...  Thus, do show ur loved ones u love them...there's no reason for u not to show ur gratitude to them..although right now, there may be a friction somehow, somewhere, forget bout that friction...forgive n forget, n begin to love and be loved more as days passed by...Remember? Days gone, days gained....  signing off @ 2238hrs...

      hmm finally, me gotta be joining the workforce again...what a relief...  I guess this is what is known as 'rezeki datang melimpar'...Alhamdullilah..  when there's no job offer there's aint any...will keep looking out if i had received a missed call always...but today, i got another 2 calls..but too bad i had signed letter already..hehe. one of the call received was unexpected...cos a mth back, i was really hopeful to land myself for that job...but i was disheartened yet again...  whatever it is, i've told myself...lessons learnt...mistakes realised, live on get on with life...yet another phase of life is yet to be faced..  good luck to me...and may the force be with me....pretty relief as well, cos my close fren in Cal, has the same fate as me, bummed for the same period got a job at the same time....cheers to us both....for being patient, rock steady n stay optimistic always!..

      Watched the final performace for AMI Season 3 on 5...Both ladies were great....but well, i am rooting for Fantasia....1st song, nah, out......but her 2nd song...which she sang few weeks back and gained a standing ovation from randy n paula...was fantabulous!..  Had so much fun watching AMI..that's what i call a reality tv show...  Had me smiling when Paul Anka sang his special song bout AMI, how he mentioned bout the participants n the judges..and see everybody knew that William Hung was being made a fool but he didnt realise that! Even one sms read 'william hung is oblivious that america is making a fool of him.'  Mr Seacrest has won me over.....  Suave, the so-called my 'ideal' guy...(now look raz, with man of his calibre and looks, he is the 'ideal' man for any other gals!...U must bring urself down thousands feet above 'cloud no nine')...He looks so woah.......when he was in Hawaii, surfing.....  Just hope Fantasia will win cos my next bet will be her other than Latoya..for the American Idol...  signing off @ 0028hrs..

      7 mins past midnite... Sleepy...but nah, i dun thnk i can sleep...the mind is super active...counting sheeps wont help, for sure...  10 mins ago, i was looking at my self-collected fotos...The most memorable of all those will defnitely be the one when i went to Bali...  3 yrs ago..thats the same duration i had worked and now eagerly waiting for an impt call..  Bali, a lot of memories... * 1st time travelling without family members at the age of 20! yeah... * knew the group, now known as my buddies, for only 3 mths while working part-time in the same dept..and thereafter, we headed to the paradiso, paying $568.00 per pax.. * save 'like mad' the hourly paid wages for this trip, willing to cut costs, had each other for motivation so as not to spend on unnecssary things.. * 6 gals, of which 3 now are happily married, one mummy...and 2 soon to be mummies.. * tight budget, can even passed remarks like: 'eh u owe me rupiah 5100.00'....(so calculative! haha...if were to convert back to Sing$ that amt cant even buy you 3 sweets for 10 cents deal.. * went to hrc bali, my gowd.......regret upon our return...cos a drink at hrc costs 18000rph....(again remarks like, 'haiya.....if dun go hrc, i still have 18000rph to spend tmr')..bringing smiles to me as i am typing this out.. * 6 gals, squeeze into a car! bizzarre right...(hmm must reiterate, 3 of us are big sized)..2 petite ladies sat at the front seat...yeap, sqeeuze each other's butts....for the 10 mins trip...and 1 'pincess' sat at ease at the back....poor now-called mummyy...she got to squeeze herself..among the 3 giants!....hahah haizz....deja-vu ... * me n my attitute: realsing i have got not much money left, sat one corner at each shop we dropped by...'Eh, yan, senyap jek......'penat ah'...(hey ean, y r u so quiet?..my reply ,'i am veryy tired'....) In actual fact, it's my pocket that's tired'.....money ran low...When the gals knew the 'logic' behind my tiredness, i was made a laughing stock!'...all for the fun of the memories'... * surprisingly, each of us showed 'right attitute'.... * remembered my room-mate, the glass went 'pianggg......'! the glass in the bathroom was shattered...and i was damn worried, cos she wasnt responding at all!..mind u, we just checked into the room... * 6 gals.....all wore denim skirt on our way to 'shopping'..some even willing to spend on the denim skirt before travelling'... * saw the most beautiful sunset at jimbaran for our seafood dinner, n that was the most mouth-watering seafood i ever had n its super cheapp...  IT has been the most memorable 'adventure' for me n my sweet pretty buddies...We never fail to talk about this trip when we meet up....  How i wished i could turn back time, rewind the tape..and had that adventure again...sure gerek!!!...power!!!  So to my buddies, Suzi Braxton, Ila Moore, Wani Spears...Aida n Liza...sorry u 2, i cant recall whats ur famous 'surnames'....ITs been great knowing u guyz...We practically grew up from that trip huh....Love ya's...Ean Simpson..

      I was like lazing around....after having a bad day....It came to my mind suddenly...bout English language...how strange it is n at times, no one tend not to understand what is English, what i mean is different spelling n different phonics n different pronounciation..  Well, i know i am not good in English, only a six-er...but heck....  Anyway have u ever thought,' eh how come ah? spelling like this but pronouce like that?'.. ok okie, to express my point of view, let us take a look at some words...(which i find it strange to pronounce it as it is)..  * Chevrolet..how do we supposed to pronounce that....i know its read as 'chefrolei'...but if we were to follow strictly to the 'phonics' it shd read as ' chev-ro-laid' right....cos of the 't'...  i remember in sec sch, had my presentation in front of the class, felt so proud when i pronoucne this word 'picturesque'.....i said it out loud as 'picture-res-q' but its not...its pronouce as 'picture-reskkk'...(i slapped my own face u know)...so malu...but off cos now i read that word the correct way lah..  now now.....as in queue..ki-yu..so que shd be ki right? now what the heck is it being pronounced as ;picturessskkk'?.....  what is english,,,ok chevrolet, i cant argue much, its a french made car..the french has obviously pronounce that word according to their own way, meaning the influence of french is contained in that word itself...  now now now....if thats the case, how come singlish cant be a 'tool' to influence the english word, n make it to be like this n not like that....hmm.....  any clues here......i aint got any....seriously...  lemme see...what word can be rojak in singlish n english and shall make it a oxford standard' word...hmm...off coz not 'kiasu' no english...hmm

      Darn...lazing around from 2 till now, simply cant sit still n look thru the books! heeh..  Got a call from my 13 yr old niece...After the conversation with her, boy, i was proud of her..She has shown lots of progress since she's in sec sch..Although a lil slow in her studies i have never thought of anything negative bout she being slow. Ppl develop late..U must agree with me right..  What suprised me was, she proudly told me she passed her mid yr but she wasnt satisfied! Knowing her to be a 'bochap' lil gerl, i asked y why's that so? Unexpectedly, she wanted to 'challenge' herself with her friends...A whole lot of improvement in her, and being her confidante-cum-fren instead of her young aunty, i was really happy for her...She knows how to plan what she wants..She knows what is a competition and competition can be good for herself..  Seriously, i hope that she will show tremendous improvement in her school work, n i will be glad if she is able to achieve what she has aimed!..  Now, i gotta problem!...hehe i promised her that i will get her a mobile phone if she's able to make it thru with flying colors for end of the yr's results...(without me thinking if the parents would agree to that..oh ohhh)  Nana, Busu ean is proud of u....believe in urself, aim high n insyallah, u can make it..  So what's the moral of the story? Never misjudged a person by his present capabilities..

      Having a kit-kat now...having a break from numbers, calculations...Hmm tmr is d day...finance paper, pretty jittery bout it..But come to think of it, once u've got the hang of it, it shd be a okie..  Anyway, I tried posting a pic on my blog...duh! very tut tut....dun know how...Anyhow click ah voi la.....check it out now...so funk n so proper...(blueh, as if)  I was chatting with my galfren, n she jokingly asked, for what study?...so old...n i told her no more studying after this course...Soon after, i asked myself, yeah huh...y the need to study?  Alright, upgrading urself is perfectly okie, as there's no age limit to knowledge....But seriously, what is the motive behind the upgrading?....Is it for ur own good? Or is it more likely to be in line with the rat race?  Ironic in a way i guess...On a personal note, I do tell myself its for my own gd..but heck, at times i just think it's more for u to be in the rat race..paperchase, yeap thats the word...  So what lies behind the intention of climbing up the knowledge hierachy?.. * To gain knowledge n not be ignorant? or * To go for the paper-chase?  Ever think of ur own personal reason behind that paper chase?...

      Well,   I really do not know what a 'blog' is..very ignorant me..but finally realised a blog is similar to the conventional diary u like to keep to; whats' in for today bla bla bla..  I was practically surfing the friendster's list of mine n i realised that so many ppl do have a blog..Being a Singaporean, cannot lose out what....so i kepo kepo want to know whats a blog...  Anyway, shall keep in short n sweet..Reasons for the creation of this blog thingy are as below: * created out of curiousity * too stress, exams period..need something to unwind * mp3 downloading is illegal right..so scared kena saman...refrain from dloading from kazaa * at lesst now, i know where to head when online, eihter on neopet.com. or friendster.com or mail.yahoo.com * finally, testing out if this blog will be alive for more than 3 mths... (cos i am very on in the beginning afterwhich, well, we shall see)..

      Sunny sunday i must say.....Woke up @ 1030am...been a long time since i did that!  Sms my fren, n i made a blunder..so embarassing,I genuinely thought one of our galfrens gonna be married today, little do i know, she is the lawful wife of somebody already last week...alamak....  Mopped the floor, like a CInderella, the kids are back to their respective homes cos school's in tommorow, n boy boy boy....the house is so calm n somehow, i am not used to it!   Surfing for music videos from just now, cos still unsatisfied with the poor streaming/buffering @ yahoo launch...finally got into www.vh1.com. I managed to watch Linkin park, Hoobastank, Josh Stone etc...with so much ease...No hiccups and steaming/buffering problems (till now what i dun get what these 2 means..figured it out that its got to be linked to the 'hiccup' of v-clip uploading? unloading? heck....so long as those clips can be watched...those it jargons dun bother me...  I am hooked on Ronan's latest hit featuring Leanne Rimes..'Last thing on my mind' yeah, i cant get enough of it...Ronan is getting more charming, well to me at least...(somehow, i still couldnt get him off from my idol list), n Leann Rimes is looking better than those days when she was a country singer..  Loved music so much, sometimes, how i wish i can be a dj! heh...now that wish is my dream actually, n am hopeful enough to make it into reality...soon...but i dun know how soon is that 'soon'! bummer...grrr,,,  Never do i know who are the members of Hoobastank, until i saw their 'The Reason' v-clip..(the singer is worthy of my attention...Ro's better looking, but this guy, i have yet to find out his name now....he is like a 'pan-asian' guy...angmoh-cina look.....  time check: 614pm haiz..tmr work work work work work work.......wed goona be a sepai with my j-lo rocker mama..maybe i shd penned down what happen if my se-pai-ing will take into action..outcome...hope to meet my se-pai target....J-lo will be helping me...love u sis! for going into such nonsense with me! luv ya faris' bigga sista'  muacks

      A week has past since i last penned my thoughts...Time shows 50 mins after Cinderella has got to rush home...  Surfed the net, tried to watch some music videos from yahoo launch! and i managed to get by to see 2 repeated clip of Ro n LeeAnne Rimes. The song's very catchy...settings for the music video is pretty kewl..  LeeAne, in a 'pickup truck' n Ro's in a recording studio...Enjoyed the clip as it shows how lovely it is to be hitched...boo hoo hooo....Ronan......too bad u r damn far..  Remembered those days whereby my buddy will ask so what u want for ur bday...my reply came as fast as lightning,telling him that i want ronan to be next to me (he got pissed off haha as i was, as a matter of fact, asking for the impossible'!)  Stupid launch, so what man i am viewing the clip foc? Hanged on me way way too fast before i could even take a look at Hoobastank's 'The reason'.....darn....  Went to my friendster's list, snooping around, wondering howcome i do still have an outstanding request? Oh yeah, thats to my sec sch mate...that air bunga guy...Again with a 'anyhow' click action, i saw his face with a gal on this gal's profile....  I was like:...ehhhhh this cina looking guy looks familiar....is it him? is it someone else?....with a closer look...voi la......this guy is the air bunga guy.....  So excited boy, when i saw his pic with a gal...compatible..felt so happy for him...(cos he was, at a point of time my 'crush' but nah, he's too quiet...susah mau talk!'..but still we remain long term friends now...)  Air bunga guy, somehow left me a deep impression..well, now now now,aint bcos he was my 'crush', but after secondary school, our life took on the same path, so as to say...  our ayahs went to another alam, the same year, we suffered a great blow from that, almost wanted to leave school..but we preservere till we received our dips...he went to the army, me went to work...then one fine day...an sms came along that read something like:' yan, thanks for ur support and encouragement, xx managed to get in to a local uni..'  Boy, i was moved to tears, knowing that he got into the local uni..from his merit diploma..  when we are at icq, we will always share our problems and encounters that came bout soon after our loved ones went away, no doubt i would cry lah..telling him my emotions..but do remember that we will always encourage each other to move on with life and not let what's happened to be a setback, always share the same thoughts, ie, our ayahs will defnitely watch us and lead us, somehow, somehwere...  .he's a smart guy, and he should be in the uni, he deserved it!.. that sms, still lingers around in my mind when i scroll down my phonebook to see his no.  I do not contact him now, (knowing he's still a quiet gentleman, i do not have special reasons to call upon him as well) last sms was sent to him 2 mths ago, to wish him luck for his 1st time ever uni exams!  This bugger is a nice guy....and i am very happy to see him in the foto..with the gerl gerl...  well, xx, if u happen to read my blog, dun misunderstand me. The crush arena was way way over (hehe thou at times how i wish...and i wish....and i wish..but my wish is half-empty barrel kinda wish' no issue on that ah..and u r my buddy bro! Remembering u for the patience u've got to 'listen' to me rattle on icq! So bro, dun forget to invite me for ur wedding, insyallah...  as its 0124hrs now, ms lazy will not edit her grammar...so try to understand her c6 english...  now now, bila pulak mr perfect nak timbul ni,,,target by this yr...2004 now dha nak dekat july,,,pakcik tu blom timbul pun...alamak.....mati ni nt yr dah suku abad...bahaya ni...)

      Been quite sometime since i am here again...  Anyway, life has taken for a turn, for a start, it's a good one, n may it remain as such in time to come...Different job scope, and it made me realised how wilful i was back on dec 10 2003 when i tendered without a job...True, never look back, but to look ahead instead..With God blessing, Insyallah...  HAd lotsa fun today...been quite awhile since i was soak in the sun and chlorine water! 5 adults, 4 kids, went as early as 10am to Wild WIld Wet @ Downtown east..Never expect to be joining a long queue of 'ever so kiasu and so enthustistic singaporeans! Well, i dun think i am kiasu..(cos Downtown is only a 10 mins bus ride from home) our thinking is, better get going early before the sun is 100 degrees hot!  Well, queing wasnt an issue...Managed to hop on the 'ular-lah' ride, which was exciting! by 2pm, i bet there's 3 thousands of visitors to the attraction!  Had great fun, really, went out to pizza hut situated at the very corner of the downtown, and had out own sweet time eating our food, with no pressure of 'hey pls give up the seats when u r done'...  Put lotsa sunblock, but well, i got 'dark' yet again, maybe not too much! I shall go to work tmr, without any blusher, cos i am as red as a half cooked udang now! Still, lotsa fun, (we even sat down at the kid's playground pool, waiting for a 'barrel' to pour away a ton of water, splashing onto those who sat, just beneath it! SO much fun, (mind u, me n 2 elder sis and 2 kids, were one of the 20 ppl waiting for the barrel to be 'in action'...Hot weather, so such things really cool things off! Dun mind going there agian though, although it's very costly!   Anyway, pretty difficult to get the family to go out, although it is not 'full strength'..   Chaio for now blogger...till a week's time

      Been quite sometime since i last pen down my thots... Soon after the last paper, i was looking towards the job as well as the results from the 4 attempted papers.  Pretty worried, mix kinda feeling thinking bout these stuff...  Well, for a start, it seems to be a positive one, hopefully, all will be well, in time to come.  School's out, and the house is like a shipwreck! 8 kids in the house, from 16 yr old till 3 yrs old.....no use cleaning up the mess made, cos within seconds, all will come back to square one...It's a very exciting moment to see all the 'heir' of the family get together...Messy shipwreck, but still, loads of fun!..  Reslly wonder to myself.....y the very much of 'phenomenon' kind of phobia, the moment lizards are on sight!,,,,ran as fast as i could when i threw the rubbish outside...its everywhere...sick! up the ceiling, sides of wall....different colors and sizes! sharks.....

      Came across someone who is damn right IRRITATING! YES WITH A BIG CAPS.....  Just dun understand why are some people are so blunt...  - It is bcos they dun realised that they are, blunt in their speech - They r insensitive to other party's impression n thoughts... - They are tooo damn right smart with a brain that is equivalent to a peabrain?  I really do not understand why do these 'creatures' exist!   NOw, i have learnt&nbsp;a big time lesson...dun be friendly on icq, though the person u r comminicating with is one whom u know in person.  That happened to me....and i was so pissed off....called that peabrainer a kambingggggggggggggggg  I thinmk even the real kambings are smarter than this peabrainer...A simple gesture, to ask if this peabrainer is bz at this moment....and the peabrainer replied, well it's office hrs right..  Well, i know i am being pretty 'oversensitive' here...but for goodness sake...is it normal for u to answer a qn being posed to u...in such a manner...  Mind u, irc-ing eg using icq, do have functions to indicate what 'mode' u r in....let me just highlight...  -online (u r online...means its free for u to chat, if u want to) - offline (u r offline lahhhhhhh) - invisible (u r online, but ppl will see u as otherwise, unless u msg that person..only then they will know of ur invisible mode) - away (means u r away...then???) - DND do not disturb (clearcut u dun want to be disturb),,,so it makes sense for a right state of mind person notttt to disturb the person who set his mode on this!  So pls ppl....do ur part, do set ur 'mode' the right manner....so that ppl will know if u r free to chat or not  For the peabrainer......hey look, u r a nobody here.....i dun fancy u...thou somehow, we r introduced to be frenz....So pls, get ur EGO OUT.....  do delete me in ur list, cos u r someone who is weird, n definitely, rest assure i dun fancy u 1 bit!   Peabrain....so anyone out there, who happen to be such a peabrainer....shun away from me, cos i've got reasons to shoo u away....

Anyway, after good ol' 2 years, i am.......yeap.....finally....bought a cd!

      Yahoo!!! Fri's out sat's in! yay! well, as per norm, nothing to do at home..the kids are not around, attn headed to the pc, for as usual, ronan's track, n some v-clips available..  Was talking to my fren on msn...we somehow, 'rekindled' old memories when we were working underground, above us, a 52 or 32?.. floors skyscraper...scary huh? never imagine what will happen to us back then if spore river got flooded, as spore river was like a step away from where we were located.  Had arranged to meet her for lunch sometime next week, describing the place we r supposed to go: 'romantik'...  Now now now.....seems like only our 'gang' knew these code-breaker jargons!..  We used to described a place with a specific name, and all of us should know where r we heading... so anybody out there, who knew exactly what these code means, u r the hubber's gang!  boat- cliffor pier (makan place best for its mee soto...shiok, cant find anything better than it)  romantik- a malay restaurant, very damn expensive...but worth going if costs r shared among more than 4 pppl, located at boat quay  168- well, sounds like a code no huh> but its not, its a food court named 168, located at Clifford Centre  mama shop- the one underground, heading towards SCB n Sg River  Makan at Bugis- Banquet foodcourt at Raffles Hospital..  Hansem- refer to our horny guy...(he will turn around to acknowledge when we called out hansem!)...see how vain a guy is..  n my own version of haw (the one like 20 cents coin, pink in color)...only fiona n our mummy helen knows what i meant when i say haw-peng!  haiz...time past...3 yrs plus i was stuck there, work sucks, but somehow, i found great friends, whom we still keep in touch with and do make an effort to go out for dinner every 3 mths...  Newton Circus, Swensens, Bbq, camping, Genting trip......well thats how we spent our whole time together...  Fiona, Stanley-d-hansem (but believe me he's not), Helen, Az, Su, Phebe....u guys r great, glad to know u while we were at the basement......
