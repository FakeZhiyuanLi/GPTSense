						   Ok..if you plot feelings out on a graph this is what you get       feelings--------crush---------like-------------love  At this point my feelings for this guy are inbetween crush and like...*sigh* a few weeks ago i just finished telling my friend Casey, that love lifes are a bit like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (you know the movie with Dick Van Dyke). It's a car that can fly, float on water, but just as easily do the things that regular cars do. Her love life is presently in a traffic jam, while mine...well...mine...was driving along smoothly and began to fly, but abruptly landed, the it sorta went along a daredevil, twisty road, before deciding it was going to ditch that life and run up a hill adn try to fly. So it acted like peter pan and thought a happy thought and went for it, but right in mid-air it took out the parachute and flew down in the saftey of a traffic jam. Then deciding that it got bored it flew off a cliff, did not fly, but instead found itself blowing up and now the driver (a.k.a. me) is floating in the middle of the ocean...lol...yes..i know i relate my life to children's movies but what are you gonna do? *sigh* presently a chitty chitty bang bang that is not mine has found me in the middle of the ocean and i am presently deciding whether or not i want to grab hold or let it pass...at any rate...whats the point of getting together with someone??? As quoted from  When Harry Met Sally  "You had someone to be with, to go places with, you had a date on national holiday's..." BLEH.

						    Hey     well...this is my blog, which i am determined to start and keep going...not like the rest of my blogs which were abandoned after 1 or two posts which in the end is pointless and a total waste. At any rate...from my profile u can see that I am a huge fan of the 80s. Probably one of the best eras ever. lol. For those of you who like the movie   The Breakfast Club   I have a little something. At one point during the movie, Bender is running thorugh the hall screaming what me and my friends thought was "I wanna be an airforce ranger." But no...if you watch the movie with captions(you should if your a fan of the movie..lol...you'd be surprised at all the things you've missed)you'll see that this is the whole song   Airborne Ranger   I wanna be an airborne ranger I wanna be an airborne ranger Before the day I die There are five things  I wanna ride Rifle, lifeboat, automobile Virgin's mother and a ferris wheel I wanna be an airborne ranger  I wanna be an airborne ranger  If this a shorter version of a real song could someone tell me the whole song...or if anyone has links to anything fun about The Breakfast Club just post it on comments please. Thanks. :)
