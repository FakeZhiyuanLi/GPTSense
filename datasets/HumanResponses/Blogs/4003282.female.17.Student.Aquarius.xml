Don't drift so far apart.   8. Look up to my role model more   9. Be myself !   10. Stay close with my close friends.    &nbsp;  Yep. That's the list. Pretty lame huh? Yeah, you know I rock. * giggle*

         So I think I am starting to look up to someone. Every time I read something she writes I wish I could be like that. Maybe I wouldn't be the way I am.  &nbsp;  I'm starting to get a pain in my stomach. Like somethings going to happen. But what could happen.  &nbsp;  I want to go do something. But I don't know what.&nbsp; I wanna go buy something. Or just something.     &nbsp;

          So I haven't written in here in a while.   Everythings back to normal I think..   Krum bums are on Saturday. Get excited. I get to see Brandon, Erica, and Syd.   <>   I'm listening to that song.   So much is going through my mind. Just about things. I didn't end up going out tonight. I feel like I am geting jealous of someone.. just because this person might take away my best friend. And I know I don't need to think it because this person is my friend to.&nbsp; Its just hard. Because I don't know why it bothers me because I want my best friend to be happy. I want both of them happy. But I don't wanna be left alone. Ya know? But I am going to keep my mouth shut. Because I don't feel like being a bitch.   Work was boring. Till I was leaving and me and Freddy had to run through the rain. I almost fell&nbsp;twice. I couldn't stop laughing. Then I saw Devin. I miss him.   So I'm sitting here talking to people about how they found someone. Not going to mention names again because... Well I'm not. And how this person likes my friend. Well I just wish I could have someone. I miss being happy and in love. Or not even in love. Just haveing someone around. God why can't I just be happy. I haven't had anything bad happen to me. But not anything good. I think that's all I have to say.. Because no one cares anyway.  <>

            So this is all new to me. I have a   urlLink  xanga    but I am geting tired of it.    So the story of my life right now. I have a friend named Oneal. Well we hung out on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. He's been calling me and we've been talking. Well I considered him a friend. Turns out he doesn't think the same way. He sat there and told my friend Syd that he thinks I stalk him and that if he called me and was like I wanna have sex, I'd do him. That's not even the case. I just started talking to him recently.. And plus I like his really good friend, Joe. So now I can't understand why he would sit there and hang out with me if he doesn't like me.. Why would he put in a good word about me to Joe. Why would he have hung out with me Monday and rush me home so I wouldn't be late. If he doesn't like me..  Why not show his true colors?     But other than that things are good. I think. Me and Brandon have been haveing good coverstations. His ex girl friend from like 2 years ago called him the other day and sat there and went over his house. I know what she's trying to do. She's trying to hurt him more then she already did when they were engaged. But now she is engaged to some boy and lives with him. Brandon is so hurt by her.&nbsp; I wish I could do something but I can't. I try to tell him not to think about her but something happens and he does. She's supposed to be at his show on Monday. Me and Syd are going. I swear if I see Amanda (Brandon's ex ) I'm gonna beat her face in.. Me and Syd.    My Squirt went and got neuterd today. I am so worried for him.&nbsp; He was all excited about going to the vet. But he'll be happy to get out of there.&nbsp;     I am thinkin I am going to get into my old jeans again. Like go back to who I used to be. And ditch all these people that are not good for me. That a rude.. But it's hard because of who I am. And my identity. I'm really starting to like that song by Kyeon West Jesus walks with me. I really like that song..

       Arg so today has been a   long   day. I woke up like at  8  and took a  shower . Got dresses and went to  band .      I wasn't going to  help  out but I ended up  anyway . I sat there and did  money . Then a lil while after everything was almost  done . I talked with John and me, Molly and Savanna are going to help  paint  the coolers. They look so  ragged . OH! I got the  coolest  idea for band next  year . Well ok. Thanks to     Brandon  ! I thought we could do a  40's ,  50's  theme. Kinda like a  swing  band sorta thing. And have  Mr. LaRoque  and  Mr. Cornish  do little   jazzy   solo's. Then the  flags  were like black  souts.  With  white  ties and hats that kinda go over their  left  eye. OH! Wouldn't that be the  coolest ! I mean do you know how many kids would  join  band if we did something like that. I think  alot  would. Just cause it's something  different  and  neat.  Ya know?

She finds out   September 8th   what she's having. I want a  girl  just cause I don't know how to take care of  boys . But a boy would be totally  fine .       Brandon   ditched   me today to go to some  competetion  thingy. I don't know  what  it was. But next weekend we are going  shopping . He's gonna be like my   gay   guy friend that tells me if I should get those  jeans  or not. Haha but Brandon's  not  gay. Totally   stright  . Remember I  dated  this boy.      My  Paw paw's  friend died today. He feel's  bad  cause he used to  work  for the railraod and they have  reunions . Well he didn't go to the  last  one and he would have saw  Bell  there. So he feels really bad. Aww. My poor paw paw.       OH! I talked to  Josh  today! Aww. I  missed  him s0o0o much. I think he called my  cell  phone cause I don't reconize the number. I  love  him.

       Felt weird seeing all the people I haven't since school ended. It was nice.      I still can not forget Kebra. Today we did a thing today and got to know people. Someone asked me who my Hero is. I told them Kebra Selah. Because she truely is. The way she lived her life and how she changed so many people has just changed my life. I got a rubberband that says live strong on it. And then on the other side I wrote in loving memory of Kebra. Because I think she would have wanted to every to just live strong. It so amazing how this complete stranger has changed my life. Today when I was about to say something rude. Kebra pop in my mind and I just didn't say anything at all. It was so weird. I'm so happy I went to Kat's xanga. And came upon this website. I'm still so very sorry for her family. I don't know what they are going through. But it must be the roughest thing ever. My love and prayers go to all of them. Just remember she is still blessing people here just like she has blessed me.        Kebra. I want you to know. That I don't know what made you make that decision and I'll never understand competly why. But your my hero no doubt. Your such a wonderful girl. And I hope that you dance and smile in heaven. I really wish I got the chance to meet you and become your friend. But I think now I have. I talked with you last night. You and god. And I'm happy I am on this path again and not on the one that I used to be on. Thanks so much for what you did while you were here. Your will always be in my heart.   I will never forget you.     In loving   urlLink  Memory    of Kebra Selah

       I woke up at like 11 30 and got online. I should know he he's not on. It's only 9 there. I hate time zones who came up with them. They were stupid.      I'm still impacted by Kebra. I let me mom and Amy read about her this morning.       I have a headache. I'm so tired. But I'm happy I got to talk to my Josh for a really long time. I have Tiger Fever stuff to do tomorrow. Then I might have to work on Tuesday and Thursday. The hours switched at work. Six Flags closes at like 7 I think. Yayness.

       I was visiting a girls xanga and I was reading it. She had lost a dear friend. She gave a website that was in memory of her. I went to it. I've been reading for the past hour about this truely wonderful young ladie named Kebra. Her father gave a speech about her at her funeral. Everyone please read.      This is the speech her Daddy gave at Keb's funeral I want to tell you what I loved about my daughter Kebra. Kebbie loved animals, of any shape or size. Kebra sealed the deal to build our home on Pecan Hollow in 1990, when she saw horses standing at the fence behind the lot and wouldn’t leave them alone. The horses vaporized within months to make way for more new houses, but our house and family remain. She loved our dogs Hoss and Blue, but Keb especially loved our cats Polo and Riley, which she arbitrarily decided one day to rename Paco and Rico. I hope she remembers to look up our original golden retriever Sam in dog heaven--the kids and I cried together on the couch for hours when Sam died shortly after the divorce. Kebra had Camo, a Camelion she affectionately raised from a “pup”, stalking the neighborhood flower beds with Camo dangling from a finger snagging any bug she’d point him towards. Ben Stiller was her favorite actor, and Old School was one of her favorite movies. She was a Halo expert, and a pool shark. Kebra loved Sushi. She was the only girl I’ve ever known who loved Unagi...tasty eel. She loved Smoothies, and Sonic. She loved Anamia’s, and by some chance fortitude she and I went there alone the Friday before she died, just a nice father-daughter dinner, but something I can’t remember if ever did before. Usually it was together with family and lots of friends--but that night the Stars lined up right and she and I got some time together to talk about life. Kebra loved sports, and especially soccer. At that dinner she talked about how much she was looking forward to her new soccer club Solar, and our tournament this weekend in NY. She talked about how hard it was to leave her old club Infinity, and all the friends she’d miss. She talked about Hi School soccer, and how she wasn’t just going to make varsity, but she was going to force Stricker to make her a starter. I loved watching her play soccer; she wasn’t the best player on the field--only the toughest and most determined. She talked about her dreams of playing college soccer one day, and I told her she’d make it happen. Truthfully, her gift athletically was probably as a long distance runner. She hated to run because she got so nervous before races--but once the gun sounded she became a fierce competitor, as the 1st place ribbons in her closet attest. But really, she may have missed her calling in Hockey. All of us in the neighborhood, myself included, used to play street hockey. Because she was one of the youngest at 6 or 7, and of course, “JUST A GIRL”, we stuck her in goal ... big mistake cuz she became the GIRL WALL. When she’d finally get tired of getting shot at and not getting to skate up front with the boys, she’d just storm off... making the game that much less challenging, and fun. She loved her name KEBRA. And any time someone mispronounced it KEEbra or KAYbra she was quick to correct them with a sharp--”IT’S KEBRA” She could be just as Sassy after I chewed her butt for forgetting her chores or not picking up by telling me, “Dad, I don’t need any more of your SASS...” and then she’d flash me that big beautiful smile. Now that I’ve told you what I loved about Kebra’s life, let me tell you what I hate about her death. We are slowly coming to grips with the fact that she took her own life, whether intentionally or unintentionally. And for those of you who think even the threat of suicide is a solution to the pain and anguish you suffer throughout life, and especially high school, it’s NOT. All it does is compound your pain a hundred fold, and forever more transfers it to those around you who love you. I loved Kebra deeply, and I know she loved me the same way, and yet she’s put me and her family over the past few days through the 3 hardest things we have been through in life... Again, I want to make sure all you kids hear the importance of my message now, although it’s not pleasant and will forever haunt our memory of her. The first was her death itself. The days leading up to Thursday were difficult, as she felt--like you ALL do oftentimes in high school--alienated from friends. Kebra spent the final hours of her life sneaking out of the house, and drinking some beers with friends, and ultimately getting in an argument with us. She went upstairs around 4am, and made a decision and a mistake that can’t be reversed. Those of you involved, PLEASE don’t feel at fault--these issues and conflicts are a natural part of life you ALL deal with at times--Kebra was able to make up her own mind, and just made a wrong decision. She knew everything she had to live for, but her decision that night was clearly impaired by alcohol, and that’s something we all now have to live with. A week ago had you asked me I would have said, “A few beers?...it’s no big deal.” Tragically, we learned the hard way how destructive alcohol can be. If you take one thing from her death, decide right now to not drink alcohol. And for those of you who think taking pills or drugs are a quick and painless way out of your anguish--consider the real effects. As Mel frantically tried to get the ambulance to hurry, I held my daughter in her bed and tried to think what to do. Her strong body was racked with painful seizures, she was throwing up blood and biting her tongue and beautiful lips, and all I could do was turn her on her side and wait for the help that never got there before she gasped her last dozen or so struggling breaths. Kebra died in my arms at 4:25am as the Ambulance arrived, but I didn’t realize or believe it for the next hour or so--I thought for sure the EMTs or ER team would bring my girl back without fail. Sadly, it’s not like it is on TV. The second most difficult thing I’ve ever done was picking out her cemetary plot. How do you go about selecting your child’s final resting place, when you haven’t even selected your own? I suspect Kebra didn’t stop to foresee Dad and her family straggling through cemetaries trying to find her “perfect spot”. And by the way, her perfect spot is at home--anywhere else is awful. The third most difficult chore we’ll ever tackle will come at the conclusion of these services. With the finality of her burial, we will start the process of burying Kebra’s dreams and living through everything she’ll miss throughout life. Homecoming. Prom. 72 more high school boyfriends. Winning the 5A State Cross Country title, then coming back in the Spring and scoring the winning goal in the soccer State Championship. Her 1st car, the older model Ford Bronco she’s talked about for a year, and which she’d likely wreck in about a month. Then her next car, the new Mazda RX8 I told her I’d buy--of course after she totalled the Bronco. High School Graduation. Sorority Rush, and pledging Pi Phi. Scoring the winning goal for Nebraska in the NCAA Championship vs. Duke. College graduation, and her first job opening a Vet Clinic. Marriage to AJ, complete with her $200,000 dream wedding. Grandkids--twin boys Chandler Richard and Christopher Richard. All of these dreams and conquests were ahead of her, but they were vanquished overnight because of one senseless mistake. Taking your own life is never the answer to your problems--it is just a way to create more. If you loved Kebra, my home and my phone will always be open for you, and I want you to raise your hand right now if you will take that invitation if and when you get in trouble. Good--before you go down a path that hurts so many around you--call me or come by. We can talk, or you can just sit in Kebbs room and be with her. And before I finsh, I want to issue everyone in this room today a challenge. As a family, we refuse to let our darling Kebra’s heart and soul vanish with her death. Sometime in the next year--go out of your way to do something special to positively impact someone’s life around you. Just like Kebb did when she lit up a room with her smile and inspired everyone, or did something nice for a friend or teammate, or went out of the way to be there for you when you most needed her--we ask that you do the same in Kebb’s memory. And when you do, please call to tell us, or come by, or just post how you feel on her website. Kebra has already had a profound influence on my life--I took my last drink of alcohol the evening before she passed away. And anyone who knew me before Kebbs death knows I was not a devoutly religious person. I still have many unanswered questions, and know it will be next to impossible to become the good Christian she was. However, I’m going to commit to try.......I have to know that we’ll all see Kebra’s brilliant smile once again when we see her in heaven.      This has touched in the most pasionate way. I just want to become a better person because of this one girl. I want to never say I hate someone or anything. This just shows how short life really is. As of tonight. I have had the most change in heart. And I want to show it. All because of this one girl. Because of what happend to her. It just brings me to tears because I have wanted to end my life so many times. But now it has all changed I know how it would effect my family and friends. And I think god and Kebra for leting me come across something like this. I will never forget reading what her father had to say. It will stay in my memory. My god bless her family and have her watch over people she loves and that love her.

I just realized it when Josh told me I should rent it. But I don't know who has it. Arg.      I still  love  my Josh.      Band was so nice today. It wasn't hot at all. I went to Oshman's and got a sports bra and some shirt and a shirt. I get paid tomorrow. And I don't have to go to work till 3 30. Whoo hoo!

He's been sending me songs. He's just so awsome. I wanna talk to him so bad. I'm going to go tonight after band and get a calling card so I can call him. I don't care. I wanna talk to him so bad. I just miss him. I probably wont get to talk to him till tonight. It' sucks. I  love  him muchas. I  love  talking to him just because I feel so right and content when I am.

        I haven't talked to Josh. I miss him  muchas ! I wrote him on punkconnect. But he hasn't wrote back.. Maybe He'll get on later. I hope.      Things are wonderful and couldn't get any better. I've got awsome friends, my friends are all happy dappy. And I'm finally tanning! WHOO! So exctied. Works awsome. Camps awsome. I'm finally  ME  again.      I worked today. I get paid Saturday. I work Saturday all day. Wow. I'm gonna lose a bunch of weight sweating. Whoaness.      Oh god. This morning I was on my way to school and I see something in the rode. Me and Amy drive closer to it and it's a dog. I wanted to cry. Actually I did. It wasn't a small dog at all. It was like a sharpe. Someone just hit it and left it. How rude. That's just horrible. How can you do that. First off how can you hit an animal period. And then just leave it there to die. In the middle of the rode. Where another car can just sit there and drive right over it. I feel bad for the people that own the dog because it wont ever come home and they'll never know what happed to their lil one.
