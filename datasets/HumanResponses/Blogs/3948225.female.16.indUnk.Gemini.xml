      &nbsp;  ***    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; A happy one.     &nbsp;   I love this feeling, like I'm on top of the world. With the universe in the palm of my hand, the stars in my eyes. I love being able to look in the mirror, without shame- sleeping without a dose of tears. I love being able to smile, without faking warmth; to dream without fears. To not wear a mask of satisfaction, and an armor of untold secrets. I love being able to breath without drowning; to live without frowning. I love being able to reach down and touch my heart, knowing the scars are gone. But, most of all, I love remembering how to live.        &nbsp;  November 18, 2003    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insomniac     &nbsp;  Poetry is my rhyme, my word, my verse.

      &nbsp;  ***    &nbsp;   don't shove me into a Paxil world     just because I cry     just because I sit in tears     doesn't mean I wish to die     don't hurt me like I fear you will     or love me without care     I know what pain feel like     so love me if you dare     don't say you'll stay for all of time     don't promise as you hold me close     your heart beating next to mine     don't let me fall too fast     until red is all I see     I have begun to learn     love can be a paradise     but those three words can burn.       &nbsp;  April 19, 2004    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insomniac     &nbsp;  Poetry is creativity, my hostility, my worth.

      &nbsp;  ***   &nbsp; I happen to actually like this one; even if it is a bit....um.....morbid.     &nbsp;   Kill me while I sleep     Kill me while I dream of this place     Let me die before I wake     And stand before death's dark face       &nbsp;   Let me slip away     Like sand through your fingers     To a place all alone     Where life no longer lingers       &nbsp;   Let me fulfill my destiny     And take death's last kiss-     Fade away slowly     In the Reeper's clenched fist      &nbsp;  April 24, 2003    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insomniac     &nbsp;  Poetry is my pursuance, my purpose, my horizon.

      &nbsp;  ***    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Um...yeah...this one's kinda dumb. But...hey, it's not suicidal! That's a step up, right?    &nbsp;   letting the drops     slide off my body     spinning in a shower     of endless perilt     wirling in a mist     of boundless doubts     droplets falling to the ground     gliding over my skin     slick and smooth     wet against my lips     cold against my heart     washing over my soul     leaving me in peace     dancing in the rain        &nbsp;  July 6, 2003    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Insomniac     &nbsp;  Poetry is my sight, my opinion, my voice.

      &nbsp;  ***    &nbsp;   I wish i could remember     to learn to trust again     replenish this light inside     that has grown so dim       &nbsp;   I wish I could close my eyes     and remember how to sleep     clench my fists tight     and forget how to weep       &nbsp;   I wish I could stop these dreams     and burn the memory reels     shut down my heart     ignore what it feels       &nbsp;   I wish I could find someone     to love me completely     a love to call my own     someone for all eternity      &nbsp;  December 2, 2003    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Insomniac     &nbsp;  Poetry is my love, my devotion, my escape.

      &nbsp;   ***    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This one is definitely a morbid piece.    &nbsp;   don't say     you've never been there     down that dark      lonely road     so lost and alone     to the point     where you just can't take      anymore     to the moment     where you're numb     on the edge     a turning point     a changing     time seems to slow-     just to draw out your pain     just to laugh in your face     you're to the point     where the agony of death     seems inferior     you don't know what to do     anymore     you don't know      what to say     anymore     you've caused so much...     now you sit through the effects     not wanting to exist     burned by your thoughts     trapped     clawing at the inside     of your coffin     digging yourself deeper     pushing away love     secluding yourself     darkening your mind     shadow over your soul     bleeding though your heart     death wishes     playing in your thoughts     dancing, taunting..     consumed by evil...     don't say     you've never been there     &nbsp;  May 17, 2003    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Insomniac     &nbsp;   Poetry is my beligerance, my ignorance, my truth.  &nbsp;

        ***        &nbsp;   This is one of the first poems that I ever wrote. My muse was a guy I knew whose heart was a chamber of depression and rage. The frustration of hoping he wouldn't hurt himself poured out of me in the form of these words... &nbsp; &nbsp;     On the edge of the knife      turning his back on the world      emotions poisoned      anger unfurled       venom flows in his veins      hatred pierces his mind      convinced he is not worthy      that love, he'll never find       his heart locked      in the unbreakable coldness      lost in the intensity      of his eternal hopelessness       no reason to live      no reason to die      trapped by his bitterness      never free to fly       wishing to take his last breath      craving to no longer exist      to evaporate like a breathless dust      to disappear like a forgotten mist       to feel the cold metal piece      slice accross his warm skin      wanting a painless existence      his patience wears thin       yearning to sense his own life      leaking slowly away      into the gaping hole      diminish like a fading ray       to be lost      like the burnt out embers      never to return      never to remember&nbsp;        &nbsp;      &nbsp;    April 2003   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       ** *      &nbsp;     My first post--we'll mark this day down in history. I have decided to use this blog to post my poetry ( I have a seperate blog which I use just for fun ). This is the place where I can let my creativity spill, without succoming to ill placed criticism and cruel remarks. Here, I have an alias to hide behind. I can say what I want, and write what I feel.       &nbsp;   To those who read my writings, I hope you enjoy them. By the way, feel free to comment, I love chatting.

       ***       here I stand      right before you     falling, arms wide open          eyes closed tight     arms crossed over my chest     ...will you be there to catch me?       August 16th, 2004       Insomniac       poetry is my emotion, my expression, my beauty

       ***      Just a bit I wrote yesterday.        knowing I could love you forever     as I tickle you playfully     your hands pinned beneath mine     tired and grinning, I steal a kiss     one by one          thinking I could stay forever     as you hold me tight     heart pounding in your chest     running my fingers through your hair     as a trail of butterfly kisses lace your lips          wishing I could watch you forever     as your eyelids flutter shut     I caress your cheek     as your quiet breath grows steady     and as your heart beat lulls me to sleep     I know I'll love you forever       August 4, 2004       Insomniac       Poetry is my soul, my spirit, my heart.

           ***          love me     hate me     what's your pick?     when i look into your eyes     you smother me in affection     such a perfect love     yet, once I'm gone     ice cold hate     fills your every word     long ago, I gave up     turning my cheek     long ago, I gave up     bowing to my knees     kiss me     slap me     the choice is yours to make     the pain is mine to bear     do I mean a thing?     how much would you give     to keep me?     why can't you at least pretend     to love me?     deja vu     because here you go again     cutting me     cursing me     as if you crave my tears     as if you test my strength     is my pain your love?     you don't want to see me cry     but, if you cut me once more     you'll just have to shut your eyes       August 3, 2004       Insomniac       Poetry is my pain, my glory, my anguish.

       ***       let my heart spill     like an endless flood     let my eyes fill     and rain tears of blood          shake the stars     so that the heavens will fall     take my heart as yours     for now and for all          let this dream fade     like a lifelong mist     wake this slumber...     and the love that exists         April 2, 2004       Insomniac       Poetry is my outrage, my hatred, my fire.

       ***      This one is ...basically about my envy over 'fireflies'...(dont' ask)..but, it has more meaning than that, which is why I chose to post it.       staring out this window     eyes sinking in the dusk     watching little globes of light     twinkle though the still          flowing along smoothly      like torrid liquid through the nite     graceful in each movement     alive, quite alive          hand against the window pane     loathing quiet leisure     wishing for free rein     that of which I cannot have          a sentry frozen still     stone gaze holding fast     as they stream through the sky;     a lighted path up to Heaven       August 3, 2004                                                        Insomniac       Poetry is my anxiety, my veracity, my dignity.

       ***      I wrote this one while I was in Tennessee. Its layout is different from most of my other poems, which is precisely why I like it.        round and round     the carousel goes     what happens when it stops?     noone truly knows     grasp me by the wrists     let's play tug of war     walk down life's hall     and choose your final door     knock once     now knock twice     a rap of three     would surely suffice     sing me a song     as we dance among the flowers     harmonies of innocense     and what your heart devours     you and I shall have our dance     twirling softly     in our own ambiance     I think I'll blow bubbles      at the heavens     skidding accross stars     and life's deep deceptions     now fly away     so meek and airy     on blood of a unicorn     and wings of a fairy     close your eyes     against torrential rain     and kiss me quick     on lover's lane     and now color me pure     like a sinless dove     clip these fierce wings     as I bow down to love       June 15, 04                                                     Insomniac       Poetry is my silence, my pestilence, my intensity.
