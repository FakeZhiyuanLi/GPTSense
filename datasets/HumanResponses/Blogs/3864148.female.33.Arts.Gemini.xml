      I wasn't planning on going to the gym this morning. I'd left my iPod at work and just couldn't bear the thought of a workout without it. However, the alarm went off, and I had to go to the bathroom. On the way back to bed, I knew that I wouldn't be able to get back into a nice deep sleep and I'd just be laying there for another hour til I had to get up again. Plus, I was planning on going out for lunch today, so I'd feel  really  guilty if I'd skipped a workout. Seriously, this is how I think. So I dragged myself to the gym, and worked out listening to the early morning news (I keep a spare set of headphones in my gym bag for this purpose). It's not too bad to do once in a while, and it can be quite beneficial--got to listen to the traffic & weather report, and snippets of the Kerry speech from last night. I must confess that I didn't listen to the speech, although I should have--just wasn't in the mood. I'll listen to it later on  urlLink npr.org . I kind of cringed when I heard his last bit about keeping the campaign on the high road, make it be about hope, blah blah, right after he totally slammed Bush (though unnamed) on all his failings. That statement would've had more impact for me had he not done that, but I guess he can't avoid it. I don't know, it's so crazy--all I know is we gotta get Bush out of the Oval Office. As a bumper sticker proclaimed: "Re-elect Bush. We've waited for Armageddon long enough."  Anyhoo, got through the workout, did my morning routine, and was on the road to work when I saw a car with the license plate that said, "MY RATI." Hm, I thought, what could this possibly  mean ? The car looked like a Plymouth from the late 80s--a dark red coupe with that familiar pentagonal symbol. Only when I pulled along side him did I noticed the tell-tale trident Maserati logo on the side windows, hence his license plate. Well, I'm glad he clarified that his was  his  "RATI," and not someone else's, otherwise, I would've thought the was just renting such an awesome machine. A relic of his midlife crisis, no doubt. Ah well, at least it wasn't a Porsche or a Corvette--that just  screams  midlife crisis.  And now, I leave you on a happy note, with a picture of Curtis from kindergarten--what an adorable little devil!

      Wow, our friends Mike & Cindy had their baby today--Emily Marie (last names are withheld to protect the innocent. From what, I don't know, but you can't be too careful). Haven't seen photos yet, but I'm sure she'll be a cutie-pie. They had to do the ole Cesaerean Hassan-chop, so no labor for Cindy! I don't know about you, but elective C-section is sounding mighty attractive from where I'm at. Yeah I know, I know--major surgery, complications, recovery time, blah blah blah. Well it seems these days a lot of people have to end up doing it anyway so I don't see what the big deal is. I for one would rather risk surgery than go thru that What-the-hell-was-God-thinking process called   labor  . Why can't we be like Kangaroos? Give birth to a peanut and carry it around  outside  the body while it grows--sounds good to me! Hey, don't freak out--this doesn't mean that there is actual need for me to worry about this any time soon. Just thinking, er,  writing  out loud. I'm not getting any younger, you know, and these kinds of thoughts prey on the minds of thirtysomething women. Had a long conversation last night with another thirtysomething gal pal about motherhood, and we both agreed that we weren't ready, but the clock indeed seemed to be ticking. Tickticktickticktick...

      On the way home from work today I was listening to NPR, as usual, and they were broadcasting live from the DNC. Normally, there is nothing I hate more than hearing politicians speak--even the ones I like (which are very few). I've been hearing much about this "rising star" Democratic senator candidate from Illinois (who happens to be black), and I heard him speak for the first time today. What a speech! I was actually riveted, and even got a little  verklempt  toward the end! Inconceivable! I am one of the most cynical, sarcastic people I know, and have always cast a wary eye on any political proceeding. However, something about the way this man spoke really touched me. First of all, it was the  way  he spoke--not too stiff, not too loose. Some politicians sound so canned you want to mix in some mayo and make a sandwich. Others who speak with more passion and heat sound like a firestone and brimstone preacher, and can get a little too out of control. Mr. Obama just sounded  genuine --like a real person talking about something he really really believes in. I haven't thought that of any politician...ever. So, yes, I was wowed, and I hope for great things for him. Who knows, maybe he will be our first black president.

      I don't eat Korean food all that often, but there are some regular provisions that I require, so I headed over to the California Market on Garden Grove Blvd., which is where I usually go. I don't know if it's just this market or  all  Korean markets, but they usually play Korean pop music over the speakers. While it's not the greatest music in the world, normally I'm OK with it. Today, however, they were playing that really amped up hyper-speed techno music that I usually only hear at my Vietnamese hair salon. They were also playing it really loud. I'm looking at all these Korean grandmas and housewives pushing their carts around to this absolutely horrible music--it was surreal. Not only that, I noticed that the song was a techno version of A-ha's "Take on Me." To take an already over-produced, highly synth-sounding song and making it "techno"--it was almost too much! It's like making a Muzak version of a Carpenters song. Needless to say, I grabbed my tofu, ramen and frozen dumplings as fast as I could and hightailed it outta there. Maybe it's time to try another market...

      Here are a couple of pictures of a very cute mug Susie got for me from Disney World. Normally, I'm not into Disney stuff, but this is pretty funny.  Somebody  has a sense of humor over there. I wonder if Walt would've allowed this if he was still alive.    Here is the front...    Here is the back...  Thanks,Sus!

      Made our way down to the Con on Saturday, and had a great time. This year was special because I was actually into some of this stuff, with my growing anime/manga obsession and all. Plus, I hadn't been here on a Saturday before, and that's when all the freaks come out, as you will see if you visit the  urlLink photos  (warning: there are a  lot  of photos). Curtis and I bonded with our geek selves and reveled in it "like pigs in slop," as he so quaintly put it.

      A couple of contributions from my boss, Dave (he of the HYGGELI license plates):  First up:   And this is necessary because...?  Secondly:   This is the logo of a company named Exodus, who supposedly helps people break out of gayness--according to Dave, they've hired Matt Damon's doppleganger as a "recovered gay" in this ad. This is of interest to us because it closely resembles a certain client's logo... I wonder if they know about this?  Thanks, Eagle-Eye Dave!

      Several things I noticed at the gym this morning:  Close-Captioning  Sometimes I wonder if this really helps, especially when the people typing the captions get something waaaay off! I see a picture of Stephen Hawking pop on screen, who is called a "Fizz Cyst." Who the hell is typing this, Lula Mae in some trailer in the Appalachians? Fine, it's hard to type fast correctly, but this gave me the impression that the person had  never  heard of the word "physicist." Ever. And the other day I saw the rapper Mos Def referred to as "Most Death." That one I'll give the person some slack on, but still. And sometimes, very rarely, the typist has a meltdown and something like this ensues: "THE PRESIDENT WILL BE GOINDFJ IO;FFIO;AWEYR;WHNJFGHJBKS;DFADFK"   Asian Exercises  I see some crazy-ass maneuvers by old Asian people at the gym that make me fear for their safety. They do all the stuff you're not supposed to do: jerking around weights that are too heavy for them, using jerky motions when on a weight machine, and doing whiplash-inducing jerky stretches (like this one lady who thinks she's training for the Chinese Opera or something--if you want to kick your head, fine, but can you do it at home so I don't have to look at you?). It all seems to involve the word "jerk," and that's not good.   A Megadeth Moment  I recently got a bunch of heavy metal songs from a friend and loaded them up into my iPod "gym" playlist. Well, what should come on during my first cardio-burst but "Symphony of Destruction" by Megadeth? That song really took me back--to 1997, to be exact, which was when I last heard it in a club. The place was the infamous Rainbow Bar & Grill on Sunset Blvd., during one of the last hurrahs of my twenties before going off to grad school in NY. Ah, good times. Here's a pic of Dave Mustaine to get all nostaligic over:   Lookin' sexy in the tank top and...tighty-whities?

      While reading the OC Weekly's article on "Orange Country's 74 Greatest Holes-in-the-Wall," I came across this entry:   35 The namesake owner of Esther’s Place, Esther Kim, shows off a daily sartorial elegance—she wears heels and dresses to work every day despite operating a sandwich shop within a health-food store—that’s topped only by her sandwiches, made from organic veggies and better than anything Mom ever packed for lunch. Make sure to top any hoagie off with one of her frosty health shakes. 6789 Warner Ave., Huntington Beach, (714) 841-4266.   The Esther they're talking about is the very same Esther Curtis knew when he used to work at Canon USA in Irvine. We'd visited her quite a few times since she opened her sandwich counter, and I must say that it  is  as good as they say! If you're in the area, check it out. If you're curious about the other 73 places, see the  urlLink article .

      OK, I'm almost at my exit on the way to work this morning and I see two work trucks ahead of me, both carrying windows. Fine, whatever. Well, out of one of trucks flies out a cigarette butt, to go right under my car. As is my wont, I was thoroughly incensed by this inconsiderate act, and was shooting laser beams out of my eyes at the truck, when  another  cigarette butt come flying out at my car, this time from the  other  truck. What the hell? Tag-team cigarette flicking? Is it physically impossible to hang windows without being dosed up on nicotine or something? Agh! The humanity!

      Remember my Hummer post where I talked about the dudes with the trucks with the monster tires? Well, as I was idling at a stoplight, my little Civic was suddenly dwarfed in the shadow of a Ford F350 truck with giant tires. The piece de resistance was when it pulled up ahead of me and I saw its license plate frame declaring: 4x4's EAT MORE BUSH. Whoa, that's a piece of info I wasn't ready for! Should I be impressed with the guy's sensitivity? I mean, he could've said GET more bush, but no, saying EAT implied that he's somewhat sensitive to a woman's pleasure (unless he's one of those idiots that can't do it right). So...I didn't know  what  to think about that bit of tooting one's horn, other than: you're probably one of those idiots that can't do it right anyway.

      I went up to visit the  urlLink Santa Monica Artist Studios  today, and it was great. A nice, quiet, laid-back communal studios environment. I went to visit Laraine Mestman, an artist that I got acquainted with at a reception for another show. She's had her studio here since Feb. and really likes it. I can see why--it's an old but airy space, with lots of good natural light coming in through skylights and windows. Seemed like a nice place to work, and reminded me a lot of my studios in graduate school--that kind of closeness and community with the other artists sharing the space. These spaces are much bigger, of course... Check out the  urlLink photos .  After Laraine showed me and her friend Barbara around her studios, we skipped over to Bergamot Station (a 5-minute drive away) for a bite to eat and a quick tour of the galleries. I wanted to go to the  urlLink Giant Robot  store afterwards, but was running out of time, as I had one more trip to make--to Fig22 Gallery on the other side of town. They were hanging my artwork today for their inaugural show,  urlLink "Emergence,"  which is supposed to start today, but  alas, when I got there they'd just started hanging the stuff, so no pix...  The reception's next Saturday but I won't be able to make it--I'll be at the San Diego Comicon (yes, I'm a geek/nerd/dork).   So, after all this running around, I was on my way down to O.C. with just one thing on my mind: banh mi at  urlLink Lee's Sandwiches!  Just look at my $6 bounty below!   Oh man, I just love this place. Notice how the iced coffee w/the boba didn't survive the drive home. My fave sandwich is the #11 Special Combination (various Vietnamese deli cuts w/cilantro and jalapeno slices and a schmear of pate). The white things are steamed buns filled with ground pork, sausage, and boiled egg--those are for later, in case you were wondering. I was hungry, but even I couldn't eat all that! Ah, what a perfect way to end the day :)

      I was talking with a friend, a certain Mr. X, who is a little over 40, and he said that at his last physical, the doctor asked him if he wanted some free samples of Cialis (the erectile dysfunction drug that had the commercial with the football and tire swing). Mind you, Mr. X had not brought  anything  up about having issues in this matter--the doctor just offered it. So Mr. X got 3 pills, each about $11 each had he bought them himself. He says he'll give them a test run this weekend and let me know what happens. Anyway, the weird part is, how much kickback is this doctor getting to push this stuff? And, what if Mr. X tries it, and it's so great that now he can't do it without poppin' one beforehand? Is it a ploy to get men hooked on these types of "lifestyle enhancement" drugs even before they really need it? Just like those commercials out now for a variety of these types of drugs, that are supposed to cure everything from shyness to adult ADD. Are we really getting more screwed up or is this just needless hype to sell more products we really don't need? I think it seems definitely the latter.

      In the gym parking lot this morning I saw a dark red late-model Mustang with the license plate that read "OC JASON." It should've said "OC DORK." At any rate, it made me think about other kooky/retarded license plates that I've seen over the years: "DRS WIFE" and "GQ BLUE" (in the Knott's Berry Farm parking lot in the mid-80s) come foremost in my mind. Any plate with your name on it is lame, as far as I'm concerned, like "J SMITH" or "KEVIN S"--it's like, who cares, and do you really want people on the road to know your name? If you pull a stupid maneuver, people can attach a name to the word "asshole" that pops into their head.   Then there are the obscure ones that annoy you because you can't figure it out, like "PRNC JOB" that I saw this morning on the way to work. What the hell does that mean? Prince Job? Prank Job? What? I remember one at a former job that read "MLDYNRED." The first phrase that poppped into my head was Moldy Nerd. Or Moldy n Red. It was red Miata. I found out later that it was M'Lady in Red--see, your vanity plates don't always have the effect you desire! So I suggest you knock it off. Like "HYGGELI"--what the f*ck's that? Dave? One vanity plate that I did love was on little white VW Golf--"MOTHRA"--that was cool!  If you have any good ones you'd like to contribute, feel free to post your comment:)

      One of my friends from college, Paul Lee, decided to start a blog too:  urlLink Paul's Life . He's the guy who complained about my bird blogs! He wants juicy gossip and drama, two things which I'm in in short supply of--sorry, Paul! But he never fails to make me laugh. He is a very colorful character whom I've known since freshman year at the Laguna College of Art & Design (formerly known as the Art Institute of Southern California) in Laguna Beach. Anyway, he was one of the core group of friends I'd made that year, and we started our friendship on an interesting note. I was driving up Laguna Canyon Rd after school one day and saw him trudging along the road. I recognized him from one of my classes--a tall skinny Korean dude with long heavy metal hair--very distinctive. He was wearing a white t-shirt all shredded at the bottom with longish cut-off shorts and a fedora(!). I stopped to offer him a ride and luckily he lived pretty close by in Lake Forest. I think I even got to meet his mom that day, a nice frazzled Korean mom who was too busy running their store in Fontana with her husband to properly supervise Paul, and that's why he'd turned into this Asian Super-Hessian, a rare breed in those days, let me tell you. His house had a bonus room upstairs where he kept his drum kit and other toys, like a computer and video game system, and I remember the light switch in that room well--he'd pasted  a picture of Guns N Roses over it so that the switch was right in Axl Rose's crotch. That's the kind of stuff you don't forget.   Paul is also responsible for the most horrible hangover I've ever had. It involved a game with thumbs and a bottle Jack Daniels. I felt really good for about 15 minutes before I started puking all over this person's house--a friend of Paul's that I didn't even know... They had to drag me out to the front lawn and let me sleep it off so I wouldn't ruin any more of the carpet and furniture. Very embarrassing--good thing I don't remember any of it! So my friend Rose had to drive  my car  back to my house and drop me off, no doubt vowing never to go to another party with me as long as she lived! The next morning I woke up in my sister's bed (we shared a room at the time), with puke in my hair and a pounding such as I'd never felt in my head. And guess what, it was Sunday--time to go to church! To this day mom never knew I was hung-over (and she never will, unless she learns how to use a computer any time soon and finds this blog)--I told her I had a stomach flu or something. I was just on the verge of puking all day, and I haven't touched a drop of Jack Daniels since. Thanks, Paul!   He wasn't much of a student--he pretty much created like four pieces in college and turned them in over and over again for assignments in all of his studio classes. He loved to party and rock, and he did those things very well. So imagine my surprise when I ran into him a couple of years ago at one of my gallery shows in Long Beach--with short hair and a girlfriend he met in  church  (I still can't get over that one)! He's now quite an accomplished artist creating 3D art for video games, owns a home, and still goes to church. I think we (the college friends) were always kind of worried about Paul, but it turned out we needn't have worried at all--he turned out just fine. Our baby's all grown up now! *sob*

      Came across this  urlLink blog  while trying to find an episode guide for a Korean soap I've been hooked on, called "Snow White" or "Sweet Love" or possibly something else. Anyway, the blog's by a young American guy named Shawn who's an English teacher in Korea, and it's a great glimpse into modern Korean life through a thoroughly American perspective. I read the most current post and had to go back and start reading from the beginning. It's sad that I haven't been back to Korea since I came here almost 25 years ago! One of these days I'll make it back out there, but in the meantime, I can see Korea vicariously through Shawn. The blog's mostly photos, with entertaining and enlightening captions--I recommend it highly!

      Well, gotta love the internet. Looked up "sparrow life" in Google and found this paragraph on nest-leaving:  "They hopped to the edge of the nest and remained there for some time. Then they moved gradually out into the branches of the nest tree. Sometimes one fell to the ground, and it was then led by one of the adults, usually the male, into a brushy area. By 10 days of age they could hop into the lower branches of bushes, where they sometimes remained for long periods on one perch. By 12 days of age they could fly a few feet, and at 14 days of age they were capable of sustained flight." For more details, visit the  urlLink site  where I got this paragraph.  Basically, once the young leaves the nest, that's it. If they get eaten by a cat or run over by a bicycle, well, them's the breaks, kid. So that's a pretty intense couple of days, but what an incentive to get your ass in the air! I feel better knowing, don't you?

      We were walking around downtown Huntington Beach this morning--for Curtis' annual exercise outing--and stopped by the Starbucks to grab a little breakfast. As I muched on my reduced fat orange loaf (too dry--just what i deserve for getting reduced fat), we noticed a little mom sparrow and her baby flitting about nearby. As soon as mom spied my loaf, she came right up to us, almost touching my foot. Her little bird eyes seemed to glare at me, daring me to drop some crumbs. Curious, I sent some crumbs to the ground, which she immediately grabbed up in her beak. She flew back to the baby, who was hanging out a little farther away, and shoved some crumbs into its mouth. She now knew I was an easy mark, and came right back, with baby in tow. I gave her more crumbs, and we watched in amusement as she fed her baby. The baby sparrow acted just like our little mockingbird Porky used to--flapping its wings impatiently with its mouth wide open, waiting for food to be dropped in. He was not yet at the stage where he could pick up his own food, and had to completely depend on mom to do it for him. Kids.  After a few minutes, the mom flew off into their nesting tree, and was gone for a while. The baby was hanging out near our feet, seemingly unconcerned about mom's disappearance. He kind of hopped toward their tree a little bit, and stopped, right in the middle of the sidewalk. Since it was still very early, there was very little foot traffic, so it seemed content to be parked there. A middle-aged couple came walking down the sidewalk, and paused upon encountering the little baby sparrow in their way. The woman pointed to it, and commented, "Look at the little bird." When the bird didn't move, she looked over at us and asked, "Is he okay?" We lauged and said he was fine, after which the couple continued on their way. When the mom still wasn't coming back, the baby took more hops toward the tree, until he was finally right underneath it. That made me wonder about how the baby bird would get back up into the tree. Can the parents somehow carry it up there? Do fledglings just hang out on the ground until they can fly? Just what exactly happens here? To our relief, the mom came back down and hung out with the baby again, but we never did see if the baby made it back up into the tree. We were going to scatter more crumbs for the birds under their tree, but a street sweeper just happened to come by right at that moment, so we ended up just throwing the rest of the loaf away. I'm now curious about the whole baby bird/tree situation--I'll have to do some research. You'll be sure to read about the findings soon...

      On my way to work this morning, I found myself behind a white H2 Hummer. Pondering its massive rectangular ass, I always wonder what kind of person is driving that thing. Do they really think it's cool? It's like the guys who put giant tires on their trucks, so that they're 12 feet up in the air. They probably think they're real hot shit but don't they realize that they look ridiculous and that most people will assume they're compensating for a small wee-wee? Well, that's what I think, anyway. Except for the time I saw a PINTO on giant tires--that was cool!   So, I'm getting off at my exit, and I see that the Hummer is not just a regular Hummer, but a Hummer LIMO! Agh! That's the worst! I think these stretch SUV limos (esp. Hummer limos) are an affront to humanity. What global warming? What fuel crisis? What decline of western civilization? Well, there it is, heading up the 405 in all its stretched folly.

      Curtis and I were hanging out with our friends Cindy and Mike the other night, and since Mike's an ER nurse, talk naturally turned to people coming into the ER with stuff up their butts. Like light bulbs, wine bottles, and other delights. Apparently, if you stick strangely-shaped things up your butt, your body will get confused and may start sucking things UP and NOT LET GO. Things like bottles can disappear completely inside your body! Of course things have to get that bad before people consider coming into the ER. Well, in the hospital, they will blow air up into you to try to loosen the object and then pull it out. If that's not successful, it's SURGERY time. I know. Is curiosity and the prospect of a little bit of fun worth that? If you need a dildo that bad, just ask for one for Christmas or something--please!  On a non-rectal probe note, I guess a case came in that shook Mike nothing else had in all his years in the ER. A man who'd taken Viagra and some other *ahem* "recreational" drugs came in after having an erection for TWELVE hours. There was only one thing they could do--they had to drain it! The doctor plunged a pretty thick-gauge needle--repeatedly--to drain the thing! Mike said that was the first time he'd actually gotten woozy enough to almost pass out. So again, if you think "enhancing" the Viagra experience might be fun, here's a little example of why it's not. Kids, just say no.

      Yes, I am officially endorsing the Kerry/Edwards ticket for 2004. Why? Because I'm an avowed ABBA (anything but bush again). I was happy to hear that Edwards was chosen as Kerry's running mate. He injects much-needed personality into the Kerry campaign, and I think will galvanize overall support. Kerry, with his saggy bloodhound-like lanky looks, does look like a mummy that wants to suck the life out of the squirrel-cheeked rookie senator, but that's OK--better than looking like a weathered Curious George, as our current prez does. But I'm well aware that this isn't just a beauty contest--it's also about running the damn country. The prez made some comments about how inexperienced Edwards is and blah blah, but hey, where did HIS "experienced" administration get us? Even the so-called cabinet "dream team," headed by the formerly well-respected Colin Powell, got suckered into this ever-escalating quagmire known as Iraq (and I didn't even watch Fahrenheit 9/11)! And don't even get me started on Cheney, who no doubt would merge the American government with Haliburton if given the chance.  I think we need to get back to being a global citizen, and not a global policeman. This misguided Joan-of-Arc fantasy Bush has about being ordained as the liberator of the selective oppressed has got to stop. Just this morning on NPR they were talking about how the army is being stretched to the breaking point because of our fronts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and how we need to more forces to maintain our current operations. Considering that ours is a voluntary army, who's to say that if Bush gets re-elected, that a draft wouldn't be reinstated, because it's "for the good of the country" and it will "keep us safe." It'd be like you and me hiring out people to go and beat up or kill "potential" criminals who might carjack us five years down the road or something. Is this the way to continue? I don't think so.

      On my drive home this evening I was listening to The Cure on my iPod using the iTrip, and I was thinking, dang, The Cure is a great band. The song happened to be "Killing an Arab," a classic of theirs, and definitely NOTHING to do with hating Arabs or anything--it's based on an event in the book "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. Anyway, listening to The Cure made me think about a band that kind of made a stir earlier this year, who drew  a lot of comparisons to The Cure. The band was called Hot Hot Heat, and they had a song called "Bandages" that was kind of in heavy rotation for a while on MTV and KROQ and whatnot. Well, I remember being underwhelmed by that song and by the band in general, and I've realized that I haven't heard a peep about them in a while.   It must suck to be the flavor of the month, don't you think?They broke out at about the same time Interpol (who, by the way, drew a lot of comparisons to Joy Divsion--from me, included) did, but you still hear about Interpol occasionally. Hot Hot Heat? Nada. I'm kind of glad they're gone, actually, because I didn't really like them, but I do feel sorry for them, now that the alt music world has a big hard-on for Franz Ferdinand these days. Who also was underwhelming, I thought. I bought their CD and it's OK but it didn't bowl me over right away. Maybe I'm just an old fogey who thinks the bands I grew up with are just better, but I'm not that impressed! There ARE new songs that I do like, however, most of them heard on Indie 103.1. I love "Staring at the Sun" by Simple Kid, "The Still in Love Song" by the Stills, "Mass Destruction" by Faithless, and a song by The Streets that I don't know the title of.

      Why, you might ask? Well, why not? It's free, it's easy, and it's about time I started keeping a diary again. Now I can enact my Doogie Howser fantasy of having my diary on the COMPUTER. As you may have guessed, however, this won't really be like a real diary. I won't be revealing who I think is cute in home room or how worried I am about a pimple, etc. Hmm, then again... At any rate, you can tune in at any time to read what's going in my little head. If that prospect scares you, it should.   On to some real shite: Just got the iTrip for my iPod (damn their little i's) yesterday and I must say that it's FANTASTIC!! It really works like it's supposed to, which is so rare these days. I also got it with the PowerPod because to me it seemed like the most smartly designed cigarette lighter adapter. The cable is DETACHABLE, so you can use it like a regular cable if you wanted to! If you wanted to buy the cable alone it's $20 anyway so why not get a car adapter with it for another $5? And the iTrip is around $35, so I thought it was a very good value, in case you're looking for an FM transmitter for your iPod.   If you go to the Apple site, be sure to go to the STORE, not to the ITUNES/IPOD tab because the accessories they list are different. Think different, indeed. Well, it caused me to buy a dock with the mistaken assumption that it came with a cable, because that section didn't list any single individual cables. Yeah, yeah, I couldn've been more careful looking up the specs and stuff, but you know how easy it is to assume things online! Well, I've paid the price, believe you me. I've returned the dock, but they assess a 10% "restocking" fee and then I had to pay for shipping to send the damned thing back! Yes, I'm incensed, but I hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale for those who may follow in my footsteps. Enough blathering for this first time out--I'll save some more vitriol for later...

      Whoo-boy, looking forward to a four-day weekend in Vegas! Going there for a friend's wedding and it's going to be fun. I haven't been there in almost 10 years! The last time I was there was for Comdex when I was working for Canon. Curtis and I aren't Vegas enthusiasts, but I'm definitely looking forward to this mini-vacation. Plus, it's going to be a wedding with an Elvis impersonator!! He's not performing the ceremony, but will be an honored guest. He'll be performing two songs of the couple's choosing--don't know what the couple picked, so it'll be a surprise. They're getting married at the Stratosphere chapel, can you believe it? Maybe we'll all go on the roller coaster afterwards. Ha ha, I sense rich blogging material ahead! Wheeee..... (I'm giddy)

      My boss Dave and I cracked ourselves up during lunch today by making the computer read my blog in that robot Mac voice. To get an idea of what my boss is like, check out this  urlLink comic page  I made about him, hee hee! ********** Wow, just got a call from the Art Director at the US Holocaust Museum in Washington DC--she saw my illustration in the Communication Arts annual and wants to see samples for possible illust work for a publication! This is really exciting; I hope it pans out! ********** When it rains, it pours--just got confirmation that I'm to be part of an art event in early October called  urlLink Create:Fixate , a regular art happening in LA. I've been to one of their events once and it was pretty cool, with a DJ and a club-like atmosphere, with people doing live paintings and whatnot. Should be interesting--low cost and new exposure, always good things!   Well, had to stop by the Korean market again today. Thank  God  no techno! But is was almost as equally annoying Korean power pop! I guess it's the lesser two evils? Don't Koreans know about muzack? I don't wanna sound like an old fogey(but I guess I will anyway), but I don't want to be aurally assaulted when I'm grocery shopping! When I'm price-comparing different brands of tofu, I need to concentrate, dammit!   A tale of two ramens:  Below is a picture of the two kinds of packaged ramen I eat on a regular basis. I know, they're worse for you than Big Macs but I love them so.    The one on the left, Sapporo Ichiban, is the stuff I used to eat exclusively, until one day I had a hankering for something a little more spicy. I remembered that the Korean Shin Ramyun that mom used to have in her house was quite spicy and decided to give them a whirl. If you want to know what it feels like to have your lips slowly roasted off, eat this ramen. The first time I ate it, it was painful (going in  and  coming out-ew), but it tasted so good! It's a totally masochistic thing. After about the 5th one, though, my system got used to it, and now I feel just a pleasant tingly burning sensation, as well as a wicked nose run. Cleans out the system!     This is just a picture of my Buttercup pillow with a Vietnamese cone hat on it. I had my friend Hoa buy one for me at the Vietnamese market and I'm thinking about wearing it at the Midnight Madness bike ride next weekend in San Diego. I'll be the belle of the ball--if I don't give any San Diego Vietnam Vets some wicked flashbacks, that is.

      I'm going into work a little later this morning because I had to stay til 8:30pm last night. A giant file (230MB) I was uploading to an ftp server crapped out right in the middle and I had to start over--after 50 minutes of waiting! Since I had to make sure it all got uploaded, I had to hang around, and it's a good thing I did, considering what happened! As I watched that little progress bar stall, I started getting that sinking feeling of dread in my stomach. Oh no, is it really stopped? Oh please move...for the love of God! After about 10 minutes, it was apparent that I had to abort and retry or fail. I felt like a doctor in the emergency room watching my patient's monitor flatline. Time of death: 7:58pm. Yerg. Nothing to do but start over. Luckily, I was able to make modifications to the file so it was much smaller, and the second time around went a lot faster. Still, that really sucked at the teat of suckiness...  Good news was, the traffic going home was very light!  The worst part about staying late is that I go to bed so danged early--10pm (so I can get up at 5:30 to go work out). So I get home and it's now 8:45--I have and hour and fifteen minutes in which to eat dinner and spend quality time with the hubby before going to sleep. My sister and her boyfriend were just leaving as I got home--they'd come by to pick up a printer from us. Originally, I was supposed to hang out with sis last night, which I had to cancel because of that damned file. I was in a pissy mood so I wasn't very pleasant, which I feel really bad about. Susie, if you're reading this, I'm sorry! I promise to call her and tell her that in person, not just in  blog , like some shut-in geek freak (I'm not quite there yet).   So the alarm goes off this morning and I think, I'll be going into work a little later--I'll sleep for a few more minutes. An  hour and a half  later, I wake up and see that there will be no gym for me this morning. Ah crap. I hope today will be a better day! :)

      I was just going thru my emails, chucking out the usual barrage of Spam, when I noticed a subject line that read: "Eliminate Your Debt the Christian Way." Well this was new. I clicked on it out of curiosity and it was your standard HTML Spam with graphics and whatnot--there's picture of a bible with an American flag draped over it for good measure, and they use this quote from the bible: "Forgive us our debts." Matt 6:12. Uh, guys, I don't think they were talking about  credit card debt  in the bible. I also love the email address that it came from: BonusBonez. Sounds credible, solid, secure, and pious--sign me up! At first I was afraid to visit their  urlLink website , but curiosity got the better of me and I had to see what the hell (ha ha) was up. Immediately the header caught my eye: ChristianDebtHelpers.com: A Christian-Themed Approach to Debt Elimination. The first thing I thought of was: traffic school. Remember all the crazy "themed" traffic schools you could go to? Comedy traffic school, Singles traffic school, etc etc ad nauseum. So now you can choose a theme to go with your  Debt Elimination . I personally would like the Rodeo Clown-Themed Approach to Debt Elimination. If it doesn't already exist, I'm sure it's in the works. Yet another sign of the approaching apocalypse. The Christian debtors should be happy about that. ********** Had a giddy late afternoon at work--my coworker Jerome mentioned that he was watching VH1 Classics over the weekend and saw  a video for the song  urlLink "The Touch"  which some of you may remember being hilariously performed by Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reily in  Boogie Nights . They were trying to get a music career going to escape the porn world and they were recording this horrible cheesy early 80s rock song that Jerome and I'd always assumed was a made-up song. I mean, how could such a song be real? How wrong we were. Not only was it a real song by a real "recording" artist named Stan Bush, it was also used in the  Transformers  movie in the mid-80s. Egad! And while exhaustively researching this song, I found out that Orson Welles  and  Weird Al were both voice talents for the Transformers movie! This is almost too much for me to take--I think I better go lie down. ********** Some drawings I did of my coworkers' dogs. Kermit is Kristen's dog--an oddly charming corgi & chihuahua mix, and Lucy is my boss' dog who comes to the office every day. She's a really cute Jack Russell Terrier, but has this weird vendetta against our mailman and barks like she wants to rip his throat out every time he comes in. Of course, to make matters worse, the guy's like afraid of this little dog and once threatened to stop delivering mail to us if we didn't restrain her! She's an aggressive little thing and probably senses his fear, and that's why she needs to show her contempt for him by barking fiercely at him. Anyway, here they are:

      My two friends from work came by today so they could experience the Korean cold noodle called  naeng myun . I'd been telling them about it and they're adventuresome eaters, so I thought it'd be fun to take them to the Koreatown in Garden Grove. Oh yeah, they're calling it "Korean District" these days, perhaps not to confuse it w/the Koretown in LA or Little Saigon nearby? Whatever the reason, I don't like it--it sounds a little too serious and not as picturesque. Anyway, it didn't affect our lunch adversely at all--it was quite fabulous. Virginia got the cold noodle & beef ribs (kalbi) combo, and Ann got the cold noodle & chicken bbq combo (well, it wasn't on the menu but I asked them and they made it a combo--it helps to speak the language!). I didn't get the combo, but got a seafood pancake on the side.  As you can see from the picture below, it looks more like a seafood deep dish pizza. Not authentically traditional, but quite good nonetheless. We were so hungry that I totally neglected to take a photo of the cold noodle itself! What a dope. Ah well, next time.    The seafood pancake/frittata    The beef ribs in background    The chicken bbq--very fajita-esque!  Afterwards, we went to the gigantosauric IKEA in Costa Mesa and had a ball. I was in search of a decanter and found a quite nice one, and ended up picking up a rug and some gift wrap also. Ann and Virginia, who weren't looking for anything at all, ended up buying some stuff anyway. They must pump some weird chemical into the air that causes you to spontaneously  purchase items that you didn't know you needed. Virginia got a collapsible hamper and a box of ginger cookies, and Ann got a set of glasses, a box of cookies, and some straws. Necessities! It's pretty funny to walk around that place and hear everyone murmuring, "It's only $_!" and, "Wow, it's so cheap!" We were definitely one of them.

      Getting ready to turn in and thought I'd spend a little quality time with my blog before going to sleep. Yes, I know it's only 11pm, but what can I say, I'm one of those  morning  people. Actually, had my original plans panned out for this evening, I'd be at a club in Hollywood called Planet Earth right now for some 80s dance action, after a dinner at  urlLink Minibar , but due to extenuating circumstances the night out's been postponed. And these days, a night out is a big deal, considering how rarely I go out anymore.   Anyway, today was a busy day. It started with a morning run from 7am to 8:30am, almost getting beaned by a frisbee when I wandered onto a frisbee golf area of the park I was running in. There's an equestrian area in this park so I got to see some pretty horses running around, as well as an antique car show! Popular place. Then it was off to our friend Art's house in the hinterlands of Corona for a pool/bbq day, which was great fun--possibly our first pool day this summer, surprisingly. I've also logged zero daylight time at the beach; I'm only there in the mornings to jog.   When we got home I was pleased to see that the copy of  urlLink  Princess Blade   had arrived (a Japanese martial-arts action movie), so we watched that with our friend Kerry. We got interested in the movie after seeing a trailer for it on an ADV Films preview DVD we got at the Comicon. It was OK--good action with swords and wire-fu in a vaguely futuristic setting, but it also had some really ponderous, slow moments that dragged in between. Pretty good English dub. It was a lot like some of the anime that we watch, except w/live actors. I can't really think of any other live-action Japanese movie I've seen. A friend in Japan did tell us about a live action movie called  urlLink  Casshern   (based on an anime, natch) that looked pretty interesting, but don't know when that's due out in the U.S. Also still waiting for  urlLink  Hero   with Jet Li to come out--that trailer looked pretty darn cool. So that was that, and now it's time for me to bid adieu.

      I realized that I haven't said anything yet about the art I make. Well, I do update my website regularly, but I'll put some images up here once in a while for kicks. The image below is an illustration I did of PJ Harvey for my illust portfolio. Part of a series I'm doing to capitalize on the  urlLink image that's in the Communication Arts Illustration Annual  right now. I need to make more self-promo pieces like these and send them out! It's not like I'm such a huge fan of PJ--I just happened to like this photo of her and thought it would make an interesting drawing:

      I'm pleased to report that my sister has now also become a blogger. Now that she's done with her Food Competition team and all, she has a LOT more free time--so why not blog? Plus, she's a great writer--funny as hell! Anyway, check out  urlLink Susie's Blog .   Been seeing a lot more Toyota Priuses around town lately, and I feel warm and fuzzy whenever I see one. This morning, I was getting said warm & fuzzies upon spying a lovely dark gray model whizzing by me on the 405. The benevolent feelings immediately evaporated, however, upon seeing his license plate: EINSTN, it said. What an egotistical jerk, I thought. Whatever points he earned by driving a Prius was instantly negated by that pathetic vanity plate. Yes,  urlLink Dumb Vanity Plates  strike again--the scourge of humanity, it seems.  A disturbing thing I noted when I got my mocha latte at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf this morning. The little cup sleeve thingy had an ad on it for "Mama Mia! The Musical". #1-there is an  ad  on my coffee cup sleeve. #2-it's for Mama Mia!--perhaps the most annoying-looking musical  EVER . Understandably, I was doubly pissed. I'd swear off CB&TL were it not for the fact that they have great coffee and I have my pink punchcard almost filled up. Damn them...  Heard a great review of the new Cure CD yesterday on All Things Considered on NPR.  urlLink Listen to the audio  if you're so inclined. The guy reviewed it like I would--more about what The Cure means to people who grew up with them than the actual merits of the new CD. A total nostalgia trip. Man, I used to make fun of those baby-boomers who'd talk about Woodstock all the time--I guess what goes around comes around. ;)

      Two overweight women in full workout gear smoking and talking in the gym parking lot this morning.   A Staples commercial in which a disgruntled young girl doing back-to-school shopping says, "I thought school was out forever." Cut to Alice Cooper, who says, "No, I said school is out for  summer ." Oh Alice, how your career continues to thrive.  Laughed out loud while reading a quote in Entertainment Weekly by Craig Kilbourne (I think) that went something like: "A person got caught trying to smuggle cocaine in two labrador retrievers. Authorities got suspicious when they sniffed each others' butts and danced to techno for two days."   Nearly rear-ended a boneheaded lady in a Subaru station wagon when she cut in front of me at the 405/22 interchange. I honked loud and hard (as much as my Civic horn would allow).

      Well, it wasn't all that wild, and there was certainly no wool, but I have to come up with some kind of a title. Since it's already Wednesday, I gotta make sure I get this down before the weekend becomes an even dimmer memory. Saturday I went to the AIWF fundraiser where my sis was cooking. Here are some  urlLink photos . The place and the food were amazing, and I had a great time--probably a little too much wine, though. Although there was no hangover, I had a hard time going to sleep w/ the roiling stomach. The members of AIWF are pretty hardcore, and could really hold their wine.   Sunday I had a meeting with a friend I'm doing some web stuff for. He's a biologist whose startup company deals with skin grafts (had to look at some really scary medical photos), and apparently as a side project he's developing some anti-aging anti-wrinkle cream with an active ingredient that's actually a by-product of the skin cell growing process. Anyway, I've volunteered to be a guinea pig. He supplied me with a small vial of the stuff that I'll be mixing into my daily facial sunscreen. I'll keep you posted on the progress--Curtis and I even took some "before" photos of my face to see the improvements, if any. Here's the picture of the stuff:    Monday I'd taken the day off work and we went to Knott's Berry Farm (see the amazing  urlLink photos  with the bonus Kristen's Kritter Korner section at the end!). We had Lil C and his friend, Catrina with us and we had a fine time. It's been about 5 years since were there last so there were a lot of new rides. It was also reassuring to see some of the old standbys still there--like Montezuma's Revenge and Calico Mine Ride. That was fun, but I was really tired coming back to work on Tuesday, blech.
