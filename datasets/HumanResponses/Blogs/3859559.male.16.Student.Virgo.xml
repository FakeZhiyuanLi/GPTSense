      Alright this is by far the best relationship for any guy. Having your sexual needs filled by a women that is getting the same from you and dosen't want any emotional attachment. Okay you need a women a friend with benefits is great for us that don't have the time or patience to go into a real relationship. I knkow some of you girls are reading this&nbsp;and are thinking, "Oh my God what&nbsp;an&nbsp;asshole." It may be true in part, but who dosen't need to fool around with the opposite sex once in a while. I know all of you just once in a while have to get with someone no matter who they are because you need you monkey slapped,&nbsp;or&nbsp;onion planted. Alright I want some input from all you out there. Tell me what you think o, "Friends w/ Benefits."&nbsp;Remember I'm just speakin my mind and when my mind is speaking it ain't thinkin so some things may get offencive to people you don't like it stop reading is the only advice I can give&nbsp;you.&nbsp;

      Alright&nbsp; you can tell by my posts that I have been an emotional rollercoatser ever since the love of my life broke up with me. I have been a&nbsp; wreck since then and I think I am finally pulling through it now. I have said all I need to say to her and am ready to move on even though I still care about her.&nbsp; Now I am single again like it always seems to be for me. So I think now then only thing to do know is to fill the void with someone new since I have the fellin that the love of my life will never give me another chance there is nothing else to do. I now bid her well with her life the one I am not apart of and walk of into the sunset never to bother her again.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright I sent an e-mail to my ex last night just to vent and let her knkow&nbsp; a little bit about how I felt. You know what the first thing she did was?? She showed her friend. What is it with girls and thinking that they must tell everyone everything. I don't go around tellin people shit about her and I'd expect the same from her, but no such luck. So I've come to the conclusion that any girl you get into a relationship suck. They will change after a while and make your life miserable. They think that&nbsp;kiss means something more than it is and will play you and tease you until you don't know what is goin on. I suggest that all men out there don't stay in a relationship. Mearly use a girl to fill your sexual needs then lose em'. It' s a lot less trouble in the end and you don't get our heart ripped out by a cold hearted bitch.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay I know this is harsh, but you have to understand. Why invest your time and money in some girl you will break up with in the next few months when you can find a girl that is looking for the same thing you are, a good screw with no attachments. Okay yeah I miss the relationship because you always have someone you can call on when you need, but it just dosen't pay off in the end. You love em' they leave you. That's the way it goes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may care, but if they don't realize it you're fucked. Okay comunicate with the bitch and maybe she will realize how much you love them and would never want to hurt them. You will always do something wrong though it's just the way it is. So for your sake I hope you have&nbsp; a tolerent women and maybe you will get your second chance. God knows I never will get another.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this day on as god as my witnes I swear of all emotional attachment with a women.

      Okay my past three posts have been pretty morbid and shit about loves lost now I will try and keep it upbeat. My life now consists of daily workouts, family time, and the occasional get together with friends. I think I'm beginning to settle back in after my bein gone for 10 months. I am beginning to realize that my life here is a little different than mine in Brazil, but that's to be expected hey. You try it though it's not as easy as it sounds. The emotional turmoil of being an exchange student is enough to drive an average teenager crazy. The only way most of us make it through is with the help of our friends and family. I don't speak of the families we left behind, but of those we find there. Everyone deals with it in their own way. There's drinkin, partying, praying, and the occasional crying. I found a good combination of all four works best. I made it though and I return with stories to tell my grand kids and some I wouldn't tell some of those closest to my heart. I think the only part worse than actually going to Brazil was coming back. Going at least you didn't know what would be coming at you, but returning is a whole different story in that you know what's coming, but even then there&nbsp; are surprises. I guess it all comes as a package deal though and I wouldn't trade it in for the world.

      When a girl says, "I don't think I can do this anymore." It hurts no matter what you think of her.&nbsp; She said goodbye and I thought it was for the best. I thought about her for a year about all the things we could do together. When I came back everything was great for a while. Then the hard times came and we just let go one after the other thinking the other would hold on. I just wish I had&nbsp;known that&nbsp;she was letting go so I could have caught her hand, but time passes and people change I guess we both did and were hoping we hadn't. I know I would have changed a few things now, but I guess I had my chance &nbsp;now she will move on as I should. We will pass in the halls and exchange akward glances and not whisper a word to the other. In our minds though we will think of times past by. I will always remember you for the you that was what I fell for in my heart and hope that someday we can talk about the good old times. I know what people think though because I have been in the others shoes. Now remember me for me and I will do the same for you.

      Okay almost four weeks ago I return from a year long trip to Brazil. I spent the year partyin with great people and hella fine women. I return to the life I left behind of small town livin and the girl I could picture growin old with. Right away when I come back I am told my grandmother has cancer and it is really serious. This nearly kills me because I used to spend summers with her she was practicly a second mother to me. I went on though I was together with my old gf again and everything was going good. Then my mom has to end up having back surgery. I spend a whole morning waiting in a hospital waiting to see if my mom is alright. Then I get a call from my gf to see if I'm still gonna pick her up so we could go do our voulenteer work together like we always do I tell her I'm at the hospital and I'll be on my way in a bit so I head out and she is already at the place we voulenteer. We do our work and she is seeming extremly pissy so I ask her what's wrong and she says nothin. We finish up our work her barely talking to me at all. Then on the way home she tells me she can't see me anymore. The only reason she can give me is that she has changed and I havn't. WOW!! Now my life consists of daily work outs in preperation for football my mom is still outta work and now my ex is hangin out with my friend and everyone that i actually still get along with after a year long absence. It all just pisses me off. Not to mention this lame ass town that I'm liven in is driving me nuts with nothing to do. I swear I'm gonna go nuts and sneak back to Brazil. It was nice bein home for the first day then it went to hell.

      Have you ever been asked that?? I have more than a couple times over the past weekend. I spent the weekend at a country music festival. Alright i know what you're think what the fuck are you doin at a country music festival. Tell you what I wasn't there for the music I was there for the booze and the women. I had so much fun 3 cases of beer 2 bottles of Pucker in to the weekend I found the perfect girl. She's got the same name as a car, but the girl was so hot that didn't matter. That's all the detail I will give you in here. Great weekend thought we had a water fight saturday which was cool. Then we went driving around the camp spraying people that looked at us funny. Hey guys I highly recomend you check out the Wallace Motongator. Just fill your weekend with women and booze and nothing will bother you.  Remember: B, double E, double R, U, N!!!

      A day in the life of me. Well I didn't get shit done today. I woke up at 11 am and was supposed to go weightlifting but, I didn't get aroound to it. I dropped off a present for a friends kid, picked up a friend gave him a ride and then went to the dry cleaners. Then I came home. Exciting huh?? So I sat around the house all day talked to people on-line including my sister from Brazil. Man I miss her we had some good times. Como un dia quando nos foi jogar verdage o desefio. Well isn't it a good thing none of you can understand portuguesse. I actually wish someone here did so I could have fun talkin another language around people that don't understand. Well I did all that and then had tacos for dinner mmm!! So yeah that was my day. So yeah nothing is happening in my life that would amaze anyone. You know what though I'm happy with it though. You are asking your self why right. Well My normal american life is all I need. Of course my life ain't perfect but, hey it could be a lot worse. All I need now is a woman, to get decent grades in school, and to have&nbsp;a great senior year. I don't think that's to much to work for. So I will do it to it and wish you luck as well.  Remember:&nbsp;Never be satisfied with average.&nbsp;

      Does life ever seem like it's flyin by you and you don't remember where it went. One day it's you first year of high school then before you know it you're a senior. Well that's what it feels like for me anyways. Well my first years of high school weren't exactly smooth, but I got through em' with onnly the minor problems. Grades, women, sports, and life. None the less I got through it with out failin at anything. My junior year though was a blast. I spent the year in Brazil livin' it up. If you don't know what I mean I went to school when I wanted, partied evr chance I got, and spent a lot of time with the most beautiful women in the world. Don't get me wrong it wasn't all beer and parties. The adjusting to life in another country was a pain in the ass along with dealin with a whole new way of life without your family for support. I walked away with an understanding for another culture, the ability to speak another language, and a whole bunch of friends I'll remember for the rest of my life. Now I'm back to what is considered by most as my old life, but it dosen't seem like mine at all.&nbsp; So now i will continue with my highschool life and finish it up and then move on to college. For now I wish you well.  Remember: What is coming&nbsp;will come no matter what we do,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all that matters is how we deal with it.

      Alright guys/girls I gotta question for you. How long is long enough before you should have sex with a bf/gf?? Alright what's the longest you've ever waited before you did the nasty with someone after you met them?? What's the shortest time?? How long did you wait before you just gave up tryin to get a little. Okay personaly the longest I've waited with out getting further than a little touch and feel is over three years. Alright now we were on and off all that time, but come on I'm a man I need a little lovin. Why wit when I know I can go else where and meet a girl one night and be gettin it on later the same night. What's the longest you've known a member of the opposite sex and neither of you have made a move on the other. I'm talkin close friends here someone you hangout with frequently. Alright how soon is to soon though? I don't think there is a too soon if two people are diggin each other. Some people think that may be slutty, but I don't. I think waitin too long though is just fucked up though. Well that's what I think.   Remember: No glove no love.

      I woke up early this morning around 4am&nbsp; With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms I've been tryin' my best to get along But that's OK There's nothing left to say, but Take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of metake your cat and leave my sweater' Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me I went out driving trying to clear my head I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this And all the baggage that seems to still exist It seems the only blessing I have left to my name Is not knowing what we could have been What we should have been SoTake your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need 'em Take your space and take your reasons But you'll think of me take your cat and leave my sweater' Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me Someday I'm gonna run across your mind Don't worry, I'll be fine I'm gonna be alright While you're sleeping with your pride Wishing I could hold you tight I'll be over you And on with my life So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need'em take your cat and leave my sweater' Cause we have nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me So take your records, take your freedom Take your memories I don't need 'em Take your space and all your reasons But you'll think of me And take your cat and leave my sweater' Cause we got nothing left to weather In fact I'll feel a whole lot better But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, yeah And you're gonna think of me Oh someday baby, someday

      Alright I'm tired of people talking about true love and finding their true love because it's total bullshit. You don't have to find love you only have to find someone you can get along with for the rest of your life. When I decide whether or not to make a move on a girl it's not if I think I'm in love with em'. I look for and in this order looks, personality, and compatability. That's all you need in a relationship. I cannot be with someone I don't find attractive it just dosen't work for me. If I'm with a girl she better be fit and good looking. I can't be witha girl that's stupid or dittsy that also dosen't work for me. I want a girl with brains someone who can talk about different things. I think that's why I'm always attracted to exchange students. It's because they've been through more than most people at their age that and we have something in common right off. I don't want a goody goody chick either. I want a girl that won't mind riskin gettin in to trouble whether it's havin a drink or two or liten up a cig, cigar or blunt. I just want&nbsp; a girl that's expierenced things most girls havn't. Also a reason to go for older girls. I gotta get along with the girl too. We gotta have a lot in common so there is always somethin to talk bout. My girl has gotta know when it's time to shut up and get down. I love&nbsp;a girl that knows how to work it on the dance floor.   Remember: I want a lady on the street and a freak in the bed!!

      Okay there is no subject because my I have not dug deep enough in to the shallow depths of my mind to find one. So I'm hoping that someone will leave some ideas for me to write about. Daily shit that pisses me off is what I'm gonna write about today. Shitty drivers is one thing that pisses me off more than anything. Don't you just hate it when you are driven down the street and some idiot pulls out in front of you. Don't you just want to pull out a gun shoot all the idiot drivers in the world. I think it would be a big waste of bullets personally. Sometimes I just want to pull someone over and give them a&nbsp;ticket for being stupid. People drivin slow also pisses me off it's like, "SHIT MAN I'M TRYIN TO GET SOMEWHERE GET THE FUCK OUT THE WAY!!!"&nbsp; You know what I mean because you have all been there before. I'm a really high strung person when I'm drivin it's likely that if you met me on the road you would think I'm an ass hole. It's just the need for speed baby. Nothin like drvin a 100 mph. over a hill not knowin what's over it. Takin you life in your own hands is wha tI'm talkin about there is something abut not knowing whether you are going to live or die. Don't get me wrong it's not like I go jumpin off of buildings, but I'm one to try anything. Rotary rule: Try eveything at least 3 time. I think they meant it to mostly apply to trying food, but I think it's not a bad idea in life.   So remember: Do it, Don't get caught, Deny it, and Do it again.
