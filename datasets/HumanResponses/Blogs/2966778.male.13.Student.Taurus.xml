      The  urlLink McDonald's Go Active!  site has a litle copyright thing at the bottom of all the pages that says it's a site for adults and "not intended for use by children of any age."  That's strange.  I thought McDonald's would never go into the adult entertainment business.  So that's what explains why Grimace is always naked!  Ah-hah!  Now I see.  Later.  I must tell the world of my shocking discovery!

      Hello,      Yesterday i went to the Mac Store.  There were lot's of computers so i opened Safari in some of them and left this up.  Sadly, whoever used the computers would close the window, rrr.  Too bad I didn't open it in all the MAcs.  That would be a nice  prank , wouldn't it?  Anyway, I also went to this party where there were little immature homophobic kids.  You should've heard what they kept saying.  Talking about how that crappy "Yu-Gi-Oh!" thing is " gay ".  They were so stupid.  Then there was this little girl who came up to me while I was listening to my iPod.  She's like "Can I get a pencil?"  So I ignore her and she's like "Hello?"  She keeps on saying it to me as if she's talking on the phone.  I kept ignoring her, and finally she stated pulling my earphones.  Then, I got mad, no kid touches my earphones without my permission.  I hate that kid.  Once, I had to go to bathroom at this house.  I'm like looking around the place for the can.  I finally find it, but there's someone in there.  They get out.  I go in and the kid just pops up and is like, "Please can I go?  I'm leaking!"  I'm like wtf cuz it's like a four-year-old.  And then I have to wait cuz her mom makes me get out.  Sad people. Later.

      Hello.  This might be the last post until September.  My parents and I are going to Bangladesh.  My sister's getting married there.  I sure will miss you guys.  (The ones who actually visited this blog.)  There is a chance that I will have internet access.  But it's pretty slim.  There aren't many people with internet, probably because it costs a bit too much.  If I do get the chance, I'll write.  If not, I'll keep a manual blog, i.e. paper and pencil.  Anyway, please keep reading my blog!

      Hello.  I finally  purchased  a bunch of songs on iTunes.  I'll list those later. So I was watching "Zoolander" on TBS and guess what they said?   Bullshit !  I striked that since this is supposed to be a "PG" blog.  That's amazing!  I mean aren't they violating FCC rules?  They don't even say   shit   on MTV!!!  Later.

      Poor Mickey D's!  They are actually helping out Sony.  Sony is so lame they expect to copy iTunes!  I mean they're giving out ATRAC's!  Aren't "eight-tracks" from the eighties or seventies or whatever?  I mean Sony made the CD, big deal.  Why make it 74 minutes long?  I don't know.  I'm sorry Sony, but you'rre gona have to move and let Apple take it's place.  Apple shall rule!  Ye inferior companies shall fall and thy Apple shall rise to the top!  Funny how I've written two posts about my two favorite companies (that's correct isn't it?), Apple and Google, are trying to be overcome by my former favorite companies (that's right, right?), Sony and Yahoo!.  (Yes, I know I did two punctuations there.)   urlLink iPod Garage: McDonald's and Sony: a super-size catastrophe

      Hello.  Those people at Yahoo! are trying to copy Google.  They give 100MB for free.  Too bad you can't search for your messages!  Ha!  Take that all you people who didn't pay attention to me today when you were sucked into Yhaoo!'s Matrix-equivalent world of mindless idiots who pay $20 a year just for 2GB.  Who needs 2GB for twenty bucks.  You're  never  gonna need 'em.  1GB is enough.  Don't blame me when I get the ladies for having invitations to GMail!  Losers!  Yodellers always looked stupid to me!  One yodelling dude almost made this kid lose his genitalia with a broomstick.  I saw it with my very eyes!  Later.

      Here are some good artists/bands whose music I am interested in right now:   urlLink Yellowcard : Really cool music!  The songs are so catchy.  I'm probably gonna buy there album, "Ocean Avenue", next.  It's a good album.       urlLink Steve Burns : The guy who used to be on the kiddie show, "Blue's Clues".  Yes, his name is really Steve, unlike that new guy who plays the pathetic little brother, Joe.  Hey, I used to watch the show before, OKAY!       urlLink Coheed and Cambria : Check out "A Favor House Atlantic" and "The Crowing".       urlLink Toothpick : Check out "Super Size Me".  It's the theme to the movie  urlLink Super Size Me , which I am interested in seeing.  Anyway, later.  (That's a pretty predictable ending by now, right?)

      Guess what happens when you think you don't need to use that Internet Security thing from Norton because it keeps nagging you to set it up? You get six viruses.  Not one but SIX viruses.  Trojans and the like to be exact.  Anyway, I won't be using the internet on that computer for a while.  But I will be using another laptop in the house (the one I'm using now.)  Anyway here's a list of artists I find interesting at the time.  In other words, I want their album(s).: Steve Burns (yes, the guy who used to be on  Blue's Clues ) Yellowcard Coheed and Cambria Anyway, later.

      Hello.  I just clipped my toenails.  Why am I up so late, you ask?  That's because I just came back from the movie theatre.  I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and it was awesome!  The only thing I didn't like was that I was sitting on the left side of the third row from the front.  Of course, this was not a concert so the higher and farther you are from the front, the better it is.  I had guessed that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban would be the best movie yet, since the third book was the best till Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix came along, which I have to say is super awesome.  I was correct.  Oh yeah, it's late so I'm gonna log out now.  More in the morning.  Later.

      I am so mad at myself.  I ordered tickets from Fandango for $9.50 a piece for a theatre in Forest Hills, since Yahoo! told me that I couldn't buy tickets for my nearest theatre.  Now, I see that Yahoo! said that since the theatre wasn't with Fandango but with another "virtual box office," MovieTickets.com.  This got me so mad cuz I could've saved like $17.50 if I bought tickets from MovieTickets!  Oh yeah, I bought tickets to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

      Hello.  Okay let's see, it's been a long while sinced I've blogged.  Right now, I'm typing up this post in Notepad on my sister's PC.  I'm doing this since she used up my  prepaid  "internet-card" or whatever you call it, even though she had bought one with twice the amount of  taka  for herself (50 taka for me, 100 taka for her).  Anyway, when I finish, I'm gonna copy and paste this into the new post thing in Blogger.  I get 25 minutes of  free internet  because when my sister bought that card for me, the guy at the little excuse-for-a shop of office stuff gave her a card with a username and password for free.  Okay, now let's talk about my trip from New York to Bangladesh on Kuwait Airways.  We got on the plane and guess what!?  Since we arrived there late, my Dad and I got our seats moved from Economy Class to Business Class.  Lucky for my Mom, she got to sit with my Grandma in Economy Class.  Well, they gave us little souveniers in Business Class.  Then we got little toiletry bags complete with even disposable slippers.  Well, it was so much roomier than in Economy Class.  You could watch TV.  I watched snippets of Starsky and Hutch, Agent Cody Banks and some other movies.  You could also play this really old Nintendo Inflight System, which I never knew existed until now.  We sailed for approximately 11 hours and got off in Kuwait.  This place was horrible.  We had to stay for 7 friggin' hours.  The place was horrible.  We got free food that tasted horrible.  I took a paper Pepsi cup and got two cups of water.  When one of the waiters saw, he took them away from me and told me to use one of the tiny cups.  I used the cups to get water out of the   slushee machine  .   Even my Dad, who had worked in Kuwait over 20 years ago, says nothing's changed.  There were people smoking all over the place, even the officials.  I was afraid to drink the water from the water fountain.  When the 7 hours were up, I, along with my parents and Grandma, got onto the plane.  This time I had to sit in Economy.  These people were now mostly Bengali people with no manners.  People refused to fasten their seatbelts, some were doing crazy stuff.  Luckily it was only a 4 hour flight.  I watched a movie that I think was called House of Sand and Fog.  When the plane had landed, some dumb guy jumped from his seat to get his carry-on and get this, the plane hadn't stopped yet, and the little seatbelt icon was still lit.  Well, then we got off at Zia International Airport in Dhaka, that's spelled like that, not Dacca, thank you very much.  Things ran smoothly in there since we knew people who could do  things  in Bangladesh.  Now, I stay in an apartent that has a room with air-conditioning.  There's no computer now.  I get to use my sister's computer when I go over.  It's really hot in Bangladesh.  I have an upset stomache right now.  I just saw a glitched-up bootleg of Spider-Man 2 on TV qand it's awesome (the movie, not the quality of the version).  I'm talking real fast aren't I?  So the time in Bangladesh is 4:35pm/16:35 right now and the date is July 10, 2004.  It's, I guess, around 6:35am in New York right now?  I don't know what time it is.  Wow, this is a  HUGE  post.  I wish I could watch I Love the 90s!  :(
