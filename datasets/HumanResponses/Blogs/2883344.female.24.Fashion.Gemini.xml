      -Ode to the Church-  What does God think of a person like me? - A wind-up toy of this world, My feeble mind, my sad heart, my poor decisions. Are we like silent movies? Are some of us black and white, and some of us in color?  They tell me I make Him cry - that I slap His face That I'll never be an angel That I'll never please - anyone. Is apathy worse than conscious attack? Does He laugh at my weak attempts at reason, at feeling, at the meaning of it all Do the angels have to wipe His eyes? If I could cross the divide - - If I could know what to do... I could live the right way - love the right way And I'd still come up short they say They've done it -they've found the way, And I'm not invited.

      I'm wondering if it's possible to gain 15 lbs. in a week - because, I swear I've eaten at least 15 lbs. of chocolate since Valentine's Day. And it was the goods too. Not the crappy assortment of flavors that no one that likes chocolate acutally likes in the cheesy heart - we're talking york peppermint patties, hershey's kisses and godiva truffles. The goods.  So, I just returned from 2 days of working in Cocoa Beach - and before you poor baby me, it was all work and no play. Yes, I successfully managed to dodge fun waves once more. It was 36 degrees the night I got there, and not significantly warmer the next day. My measely spring suit and I decided that I'm not that much of a hardcore surfer.  "Marty-gras" tomorrow night a la pub! See you guys there!

      So, I had to be as nice as my friends, and send a "shout-out" to my boyfriend for his birthday. A little known fact about tj, is that he is a major contributor to our fine King's English - that's right. In fact he is a published author. You can check out his inspirational additions to the English language  urlLink here . (Check out "bufalay" - everybody's using it.)

      If thou must love me, let it be for nought Except for love's sake only. Do not say 'I love her for her smile--her look--her way Of speaking gently,--for a trick of thought That falls in well with mine, and certes brought A sense of pleasant ease on such a day For these things in themselves, Beloved, may Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought, May be unwrought so. Neither love me for  Thine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry, A creature might forget to weep, who bore Thy comfort long, and lose thy love, thereby! But love me for love's sake, that evermore Thou mayst love on, through love's eternity.  "Sonnets from the Portuguese, XIV" -Elizabeth Barrett Browing  This poem just really moved me when I found it this past week. You just don't find beautiful poetry that often anymore - and I appreciate free verse if anyone does. But there's something so lovely that comes with proper poetry. I have to think that in the mainstream arena of life - with all of our modern technical advances and cool blogging and digital this and that - that a lot of beauty has been left by the wayside. We now have to step out of the mainstream to find the art and grace in life whether it's written, spoken, sung, drawn or what have you. Here's to bringing the beauty back.

      He requested, we delivered. I had my first get together at my house this weekend, and it was a wine and cheese party in lieu of the departure of  urlLink Daniel.   The wine varied from Sake to fancy blends toted down from Seattle, the cheese from pepperjack to wendsleydale, and the company from old faces to new. Aside from  urlLink TJ scowling at every nice passerby , everyone seemed to have a good time. My only regret is that I didn't take more pictures. These are the few that I have (  urlLink 1   urlLink 2   urlLink 3   urlLink 4 ), and it makes it look like there were only 4 of us there. Sorry to everyone else that was there that I missed!!  Daniel, best of luck in Texas. We'll all miss your company. Come see us soon, cause you know none of us are going anywhere!

      I really dig this girl. She's a complete soul surfer, artist, and has travelled all over the world, just for a few. I just bought one of  urlLink her prints  for my house, and was browsing a bunch more on  urlLink her site ...which you should definitely check out. It's not too often that I find artists like this that I actually like, but she's got a really unique style, and she definitely walks the talk.

      So I'm lame and borrowed (that word's nicer than stole) this clip from a friend's site. But he was right, and it was moving.  I love the beach for its gray/blue sky right before the sun comes up, then as the first rays jet out over the calm water, they change the color of the sand from brown to gold. I love the beach with a crystal clear aqua blue sky, bouncing off of the blues and greens in the water - making it so alive and inviting. The water moves in slow motion for me those days, allowing me to drink in each passing minute to the fullest - eager for the next, thankful for the last, happy to be alive and part of it. The sun sorching the sand, turning it to white. I love the beach with the dark rumble of an approaching storm - the sky wild and purple, just churning and clashing together - like thick charcoal steam from a freight train rolling over the horizon. The waves angrily dancing below. The battered sand a deep cold univiting gray. I love the beach at sunset - the sky a watercolor fingerpainting of hot pink, peach, coral, yellows - blues and purples. The reflection making the water look like spilled oil with its swirling rainbows within. The sand looking pink - the beach is alive at sunset. I love the beach at night with the black sky and twinkling stars stretched out above. The moon with it's silky silver train leaking down and accross the lapping waves. The cool silver sand covering my toes. A hot cup of coffee to warm my hands, and hopefully good company to warm my heart.  I think I see everything  - in fact I strive to. To make mental pictures in my mind, so that at a moments notice, I can go back to that place -to that feeling-to that observation, and continue reliving and enjoying it over and over. Maybe I do physically see everything, but after  urlLink listening to this,  I realized that I've missed so much. The man that gave this interview is blind, and his experience of this place that I'm so familiar with is decisively different, but so beautiful. I still have so much to see.

      I read this little blurb from C.S. Lewis's book  A Grief Observed  and it really struck me.         “Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing to believe in God. The real danger is of coming to believe such dreadful things about Him. The conclusion I dread is not ‘So there is no God after all,’ but ‘So this is what God’s really like. Deceive yourself no longer.’    I feel like this has been my struggle with God for the past 2 years or so. I am hard pressed to believe that I would ever get to a point where I could not believe in God, but in many ways, I do feel a bit disillusioned. Especially after this past year. I do find myself saying - I know you're there, but this is what you really allow? This is the way the world is allowed to go on? I have really been seeking what I feel is God to me - the God I know that wants to know me - not the one that was taught to me - but the living and breathing one that influences and affects my life and gives me purpose on this earth. I also feel myself shrinking back at times and with certain experiences and wondering if this is what the real God is really like. Is this the God that I've sought for so earnestly?       I have no answers. I come with many questions. The search continues. I had just not had my thoughts expressed so clearly until I read Lewis's paragraph.

      This is the one time of year that my name sounds really cool. Hopefully all of you will dig deep to find your irish roots today and gather in many a pub to eat, drink and be merry. For those of you who want to show off your Irish knowledge, you can take the history channel's  urlLink "All Things Irish Quiz".  I got a whopping 3 questions right....i know i know, a disgrace to ireland herself. See if you can show me up. Happy St. Patrick's Day!

      To touch the wall of discovery   for just a brief moment To have a revelation   for even a passing second A whim of genius The breakthrough to give   navigation to the journey The light of love    to warm my shoulders The want of another   to find satisfaction in me...  No answers to the query No directions for the travel No companion for my soul.

      So, I recently finished reading , re-reading rather, The Stranger by Albert Camus. It's kind of like the existentialist's mantra put into living form through the main character Mersault. I haven't read this book in almost 9 years, and thought that I might get much more from it this time around.   The point Camus is making (ironic actually that he is trying to put accross a point and affect other people -antithesis of his philosophy) is that there isn't one. No point for anything. You just live day to day and whatever happens happens and it affects nothing.  In fact, when you do have a passing thought of an emotion, it will confuse the heck out of you, because there is no point for emotion or even thought about emotion in life.   I just can't reconcile this form of belief. If there is no point, why the hell am I here? I'd rather not be. I am affected by and do affect others and things in this world. The pain and suffering right along with joy and love are what make being alive real. The idea that tomorrow just might be better than the last and the anticipation of the unknown is what keeps me breathing for another day.   Anyway, I would think that psychologically, it's nearly impossible to actually live a proper philosophically existentialist lifestyle. You would have to be so incredibly emotionally detatched - it would just be devastating for the people around you. It's possibly the most selfish philosophical position that one can take. You wouldn't care of course - but unless you really deeply do have emotional/psychological problems - it would be nearly impossible to detach yourself to that degree. And for what point? I guess I'm a bit too goal oriented for existentialist philosophy.

      You know - Florida gets knocked a lot for a lot of different reasons, but I don't think anyone in their right mind could say that they would want to be anywhere else when we're having weather like we are right now. For that very reason, we got out and spent the weekend in the great outdoors, and what a great weekend it was.  Sat. morning TJ and I went down to Las Olas with some friends to an art fest and spent the beautiful morning perusing mildly interesting exhibits. We got a great little lunch at this deli on Las Olas and strolled through the local neighborhoods looking at all of the unique houses. It was really fun.  Kind of on a bit of a whim, we headed up to Jupiter around 5 to Jonathon Corbitt State Park to go camping. We bought an awesome new tent and were pretty stoked to get it up and give it a try. Now this place is for REAL camping - no electricity, no bathrooms, no lights - just you, the outdoors, and the alligators. Yep, the alligators.  Almost all of sites sit on water and we spent all night listening to the alligators grunt and finding their little red eyes looking at us with the mag light. We had one little near run-in with a little guy, but thanks to TJ and his expert pine cone throwing ability, we effectively scared him off. We also saw an owl, an otter, a turtle, tons of birds, and tons of bird-size mosquitos. It was just beautiful.  On the way out the next morning, we called up our buddy  urlLink Steve,  just to find that he and some other friends were headed to Peanut island with their boat.  We met up with them and spent the remainder of the day lounging around on the boat and in the water on the sandbar just off of the island. The weather was perfect, the company was great, and I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend a Sunday. Needless to say, I'm not in a huge rush to get on with my work week. Ahhh, viva la weekend.

      Ok, first off, did anyone see Larry King last night. Probably not - he wasn't interviewing anyone really exciting - the American Idol judge panel and a panel discussion on the Kobe Byrant case. The real excitement came in the fashion form. Did anyone see that man sporting a black shirt with hot pink suspenders?! What a little plate he is these days! When Larry King is wearing it - you know the punk / coolness factor is just way out the door.  Secondly, I was really intrigued by this  urlLink article  that tj and I ran accross last night. I think it's so wonderfully convenient how the separation of church and state is just utilized to benefit politicians in anyway they see fit. No, no, you can't bring religious ideas into the school system - it vioates the separation of church and state becuase we are a state runned insititution - even though there might be people of those religious faiths in the institution. But then, yes, of course we can make mandates on your privately run, religious based, organization and it doesn't violate the separation of church and state becuase there are people that don't share those religious views employed there. Well, my god, if a Catholic hospital (for example) were to only hire Catholics, you know it would only be a brief matter of time until they were sued for discrimination. What a freakin' load. I love it. What it comes down to, is that as long as an organization is privately owned and run - as long as it's not violating federal laws - they should have the right to run their business how they see fit. Yes, they are still open to civil suits from employees, but that set up is what is supposed to protect private and not-for-profit organizations from lawsuits. Unbelievable. These type of issues is what really makes me struggle to have faith in our system and country sometimes.  Thirdly, I saw the Jesus movie Sun. night.  I don't like calling it the passion movie, because I feel like it sounds cheesy, and there was absolutely nothing cheesy about this movie whatsoever. I've had a few thoughts sprout since seeing the film. One - I fist felt that I had to see the film, even if I really didn't want to, knowing the gruesomeness of the content. I had some weird feeling that that was the least I could do - to face what happened. I mean, I went to the Holocaust museum - both of them (DC and Israel) - even though it made me uncomfortable and even nauseous at times. I've gone to the Vietnam memorial even though physically seeing all of the names has brought tears. Getting face to face with the pain and suffering of others seems like the best way to honor them in some circumstances. Acknowledging what they went through, rather than brushing it under the rug to make us more comfortable. So, with that in mind, I felt that I had an obligation for the purpose of honoring to see the movie. Two - After seeing the movie, I felt like I had a ton of information and content to chew on and digest. Like I would be processing it for weeks and slowly letting it impact and motivate me (to what I'm not sure). And the first day or so, this was true. But, it's absolutely amazing how easy it is to let go and forget so quickly.  It's like, see it once - shock value, then you don't have to look at it or see it or think about it anymore. See it everyday and you just become numb to it. This concept was partially responsible for my getting the cross portion of my tattoo year's ago. I wanted a physical reminder daily that I couldn't get away from of what my beliefs are rooted in. Regardless of how I or my philosophies change, I will never be able to deny that I have roots that start there. Anyways, it's kind of sad that I had to tattoo something on myself to make myself think about it. It's kind of like, what exactly does god have to do to get my attention? Third - I've really been wondering what impact seeing that movie has on people  have not had the same religious upbringing that I have. I mean, I knew every scene before it happened - I've been to those places physically and know all of the stories and theories. I have thought it over and over again, and really can't even fathom what impact this would have on others at all.  I'd love to do personal interviews with a handful of people just to see what they have to say - good, bad, intrigued or indifferent - whatever. I guess because being comfy cozy with religious themes is so normal and not having any background with that is so foreign to me -  how the whole god concept effects other people outside of religious upbringings psychologically is just facinating to me.  Anyways, that's about it for now. Enough procrastinating and off to work...

      So yesterday I made the trek accross the state to slow as molasses Naples to visit a buddy of mine who's just gotten a job as a crew member on a 75 ft. Sunseeker yacht. So I got to waltz up on this beast of a freaking boat and luxury isn't the word. From the 40" flat screen plasma 360 degree swivelling tv to the plush soft leather couches, this thing was bling-blinging.  After lusting after the boat for awhile, we took a drive past the owner's huge house right on the gulf. This neighborhood looked like it was something out of Beverly Hills. I had no idea there were homes like that in Naples. It's all about keeping up with the Jones's though. One neighbor trying to outdo the other.  We cruised over to the beach afterward, where I ended up playing 4 solid hours of 2 on 2 beach volleyball. What a freaking blast. I came with my A game on, and my partner and I won every match we played but one. We had a full-on audience - people were hanging on their balconies (in the hotel next to the court) watching and cheering us on. All of these overweight super white midwest tourists were congratulating us and asking us ridiculous questions. I haven't played like that in years. Day of my year right there (at least until I go snowboarding in BC)  Way too much fun. Got to watch the sun sink over the water and headed back home late that night, only to wake up to some wicked sore muscles. Well well worth it!

             Being the bearer of bad news is neither somehting I cherish or something I ask for. My heart aches for the one who's heart I know will soon be aching. My stomach twists in knots and churns putting myself in the receiver's shoes. My mind races with different scenarios and possibilities, as I know I will soon be asked for advice and answers.        But that's what love is, right?  Felling deeply for those around you  - carrying their burden along with them regardless of mistakes made and consequences rendered.  This here is enough to scare me to death about having children and parenting.  How do you allow your kids to fall and suffer? The live and learn concept is an integral part of the growing and maturing process, but who knew it was so painful on this end? My respect for good parents grows everyday.

      So I'm heading to the West Coast in just 2 weeks, and after I do the  urlLink sales meeting thing  in CA, I'm heading up to Seattle to see good buddy  urlLink Tim . That in itself should be a blast - I've never been there and am expecting nothing less than amazing. But, to make the deal even sweeter, Tim and I are heading north to Oh Canada - destination  urlLink Whistler/Blackcomb mountain, BC . How incredibly stoked am I!!!! I'll be able to get in a few days of late season riding, which I didn't think was gonna happen at all this year. So excited - especially after last year's riding was cut a bit short with the achilles thing. Pretty gosh darn cool, eh?  I'll be posting pics out the woo woo when I get home, and that's really something to look forward to!

         My poor little neglected blog. I kind of feel the same way though. Like I look in the mirror in the morning ,after I slump out of bed, and something deep inside that head I see in the reflection says  - poor little neglected girl - I wish she would take care of herself. I've been running myself a little ragged - thanks to my "new found sense of responsibility and spunk". I am now taking on the world - and the world is fighting back - at least my checking acct. is. The sleep deficit doesn't help either. It really doesn't help my mood - or the way I interpret and react to things.      I'm dying for something - just don't know what it is. Vacation? Change of pace - new faces - hair cut - glass of wine  - one really good kiss that just sweeps you into another world (guess that's called unrealistic). I don't know - take your pick.       I'm trying though. Bought some new clothes, going out with new people, trying to get that hair cut, got tickets to see DMB, taking off for Seattle, gonna have that glass of wine in a minute... Something's got to give me a break sometime soon......

      Whatever you do - no matter how tempting it may seem - do not, and I repeat, do not lose your cell phone; especially when you don't have a land line and it is your only means of verbal communication. We believe that we can live without cell phones, but it is just a lie, so be aware. That's right - for the time being email is my only means of communication until I get the cell phone thing resolved, so email away! Hopefully I'll be talking with you all again sometime soon.

      Well - this past week has been an incredible ride. I've officially been living like a rock star.  Quiksilver came to town in a big way and blew up the South Beach scene.  I got to drive around on the  urlLink Quamav , eat at the best  urlLink restaurants  (try a champagne mojito if you ever get the chance by the way), stay at the nicest  urlLink hotels , party south beach style ( urlLink 1,   urlLink 2 ) and (my favorite thing out of it all) take a  urlLink sushi  dinner cruise on the Indies Trader -  urlLink quiksilver's famous crossing boat.  This boat has travelled nine seas carrying the world's best surfers and here I was just hanging out like it was my everyday thing. We were jumping off of the roof, which was full on 20 or 30 feet up and the sushi boat was big enough to take a cruise on itself. Check out the little  urlLink plane  that did a drive by...There aren't words to tell how stoked I was on the whole deal.( urlLink 1 , urlLink  2 , urlLink  3 ).

      So, not to overrun everyone with comments on the Calvin / Keith show at the good ol' Red Lion last night, but it was pretty cool. First, it was just nice being back there with good company and good music. Second, when is hanging with Calvin a bad night for anyone? And then there's the third - the infamous individual of the evening. I think we all know who I'm talking about here. I've read a bunch of everyone's commentary on this particular individual's way of carrying themself last night, and to say the least, it was not showworthy behavior. But, really guys, did she seem like the type that frequents shows like that? The type that might have an iota of respect or even experience for local artists and "the scene" for lack of a better term. So, on that note, as much as I was annoyed too, and as much as I would have liked to say things like - you think anyone would know better - she really probably didn't. I got the feeling that she probably didn't know about a lot of things.  Anyways, cheers Calvin - it's sad to see the cpm thing coming to a final winddown, but good to know that we can still enjoy him and his music on occasion. Finally, I just have to say this, I do believe that I heard someone drop "bufalay" like it was hott last night - - - a certain someone would be so proud. The movement is spreading. ps - my pictures sucked - not blog worthy.

      Well the weary traveller has returned, a bit begrudgingly I must say, seeing that I am in love with Seattle. I had an amazing time with the  urlLink guys . Tim and I made the trek from Seattle to BC to go snowboarding at Whistler on Friday. We stayed in the village at the foot of the mountain, about a minutes walk from the gondola and got to ride Friday and Saturday. There's so much to tell - highlights being the amazing warm weather (nothing like snowboarding in a long sleeved t-shirt), gorgeous landscape, free sake, and trail mix with white chocolate, milk chocolate and peanut butter chips in it. Word to the wise, when the canadian border patrol asks you what the purpose of your trip is, don't say,"it's personal".  urlLink Tim  got some great shots at the mountain(I took all of mine the old timer's way, 35mm)to give you an idea of what we were looking at:  urlLink 1,   urlLink 2,   urlLink 3,   urlLink 4,   urlLink 5,   urlLink 6,  and here are some crappy shots I got from the car of vancouver ( urlLink 1,   urlLink 2,   urlLink 3,)  and the drive up to the mountain,  urlLink (1,  urlLink  2).

      (Tim tells me that's what the locals call it).  So here I am in beautiful Seattle. I am so in love with this city already. This has got to be the most gorgeous piece of earth I've ever laid my eyes on. I was down in Huntington Beach, CA till yesterday, then hopped up here to spend a couple of days with tim and rob. Last night Tim and I went to this super hipster sea-tac bar/restaurant called bleu. Think a cross between a fort that you would have built as a kid and the biggest fire hazard this city has ever seen. They specialize in their drink department - the menu is like 25 pages long. So I got this  urlLink drink that looked like a science experiement  and tim got something called a black velvet -think guiness better than you could ever imagine having it. (scott you're gonna want this recipe when i get back). Anyway, this place was super cool. Today (which was once again gorgeous) we did the downtown thing, and then jumped on a urlLink  ferry  and went to Brainbridge Island. We found this little pasta place that makes everything from scratch, and had an awesome lunch. We're heading out to BC tomorrow to snowboard for 2 days, then it's back here for a bit more. I can see how easy it would be to come here and never leave - it's pretty much everything i thought it would be and more.

      I'm not sure that I even know where to start with how fantastic last night's show was. Was is something to do with the fact that they might as well have been in my living room, we were so close? Was it being in an intimate enough setting where  urlLink karin and linford  (or as she pronounced it with her strong midwest accent - "lenfurd") could carry on little conversations with people in the audience. Was it the fact that we were so close that I could hear Linford softly tap his foot on stage to keep time while playing guitar. It was the crowd (better yet, lack thereof), the ambiance of the old 1920's silent movie theatre, the words spoken and lyrics felt in the air, the worn instruments, and oh that voice... They seemed to have such a neat connection on stage, in addition. A mutual admiration and respect for one another's talents.  It was so fun to be able to see the little inside smiles and glances they would shoot each other during and in between songs. And wow, who would have thought that her voice was even more moving and beautiful live. It blew me away with the first note.  That hole experience was just surreal. Thanks for going with me  urlLink guys  - definitely not an experience that I will forget anytime soon!

      This past weekend I hopped up to Orlando to go to Kristen's - who is my closest friend from high school -graduation from UCF. She's gone through alot in the past 2 years, and I felt like it was important to be there to cheer her on. Anyway, the funny part about hanging with the Volman family, is that the shortest person (including girls) in the family is 5'10", so I've always felt like a midget when I'm around them. Take a look at  urlLink the pic , and you'll know what I mean. Anyway, congrats  urlLink Kristen , you deserve it!

      Not this past weekend, but the one before we loaded up the car and headed down to mia to go to the  urlLink Redbull flutag . The basic concept is that teams try to create homemade flying machines which are then launched off of a 30ft. high platform over the water. The one that flies/glides/flips/falls, what have you, the farthest, wins. I was under the impression that people really tried to create machines that would fly, but it seemed like there were more theme machines (Homer Simpson operated by life-sized Duff beer cans for instance) than acutal aerospace science projects out there. It was pretty amusing at first - watching dolphins try to fly, a derby hat, Homer and more, but quickly the excitement ran thin. The weather was hot and beautiful though, and I think we had a good time sweating together. Anyway, I only took a few pix -  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . Goodtimes.

         So, we're finally back! Yes, tj and I set out to conquer the South and it was putty in our palms. It was great - in what other part of our fine country can you find things like urlLink  roosters  made out of car parts? I dare you to find one. Within the confines of a week, we traversed Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Southern Illinois, Missouri, and Georgia, and ate more biscuits, potatoes and homemade pie than we could stand!   We started with a jog up to Orlando to see a good friend of mine, then onto  urlLink Memphis , TN to visit my  urlLink grandma ,who I haven't gotten to see in a few years, and worship to Elvis statues. I took TJ downtown, as he had never been there, and we started at the original and stately Peabody hotel downtown (you know the one where the ducks swim in the urlLink  fountain . We had  urlLink lunch  there and walked down to  urlLink Bealle St.,  where jazz and blues greats alike got their starts. Several of them (like BB King) own clubs and bars there now and it's still the swingingest place to be in Memphis.   After the stay in Memphis, we headed accross the great  urlLink Mississippi  to southern Ill. to visit TJ's extended family. We stayed at his grandma's house, which I must say is the quintessential  urlLink grandma's house , and had just a lovely time. We played darts at the local bar Chevies, we went tubing at Crab Orchard Lake, we drank Stag Beer... There's nothing better.   Glad to be back home. Miss seeing everyone. About 10lbs. fatter from excessive Cherry Delight pie. Oh, and from approx. 24 collective hours of highway driving experience, not to mention several more of in-town trips, I highly recommend books on cd. We finished 2 of them.

      Hey, thanks to everyone that came out to my little shindig for my  urlLink birthday ! You guys are the best and really made it a rad night for me!! I should have more pix to come, but tj took most of them on his camera. I do have this one shot of all of these  urlLink hott ladies . Let me just say, there are some lucky men in the audience!

      So I'd love to blog my trip with TJ and all of the great pix we took and many other things for that matter, but I am having all sorts of problems. I can't seem to access photobucket anymore (something with my browser setting I think) and I still can't seem to get my comments going.  s t r u g g l i n g.

      So, shall I go through the list of things making me happy today? To start the day off right (fellow homeowners will appreciate this), escrow and the people responsible with setting it up correctly are bufalay. 1/2 hr. phone call (5th one)right there. Then I tried to hook up the new mouse (little mini wireless one) that TJ got me, but it was broken, finally received the shelves and lamp I ordered from IKEA - all the shelves have damamged corners and the powercord to the lamp doesn't work - not to mention that I accidentally put 2 holes in the paper shade. I also, for some ridiculous reason, cannot get onto the image hosting website that i use to post pictures on my blog. Something with my browser settings...I don't know. complain complain complain. Happy return home from vacation.

       urlLink "People don't want a President to think that every important decision has a stamp of God's approval and that God is always on his side," says ethicist Cromartie. "I think people want their Presidents to be pious but not self-righteously so. So there's a paradox, isn't there? A President has to seem to be relying on God's wisdom but not acting like all his decisions are God's decisions." It's the difference between praying that you're right and believing that prayer makes you right...

      I must be so cool. Not only did I finally achieve a spot on Daniel's blogroll, but this hot rock star that I know that was in this band that I used to go see all the time just put me on his blogroll too (check it at  urlLink innocencetakestime ).  this is the best day of my life. (until my birthday on sunday).

      This is a two-fold announcement:  1. I have re-entered the communicating realm. That's right I now have a working phone and a computer/internet again. So, now you guys have no excuses not to be in touch!  2. The b-day shindig has been officially rescheduled from Fri. night to Sat. night a mi casa. If you read this, you have an invitation. Call me or TJ or info/directions etc.   Stoked to see you guys soon.

      So, I'm still of the communicating disabled world. I have yet to receive my new phone and I'm relying on the use of tj's computer, as mine (which is a work computer,) is being exchanged out for a new updated one. -yay! on that by the way- I wish the real world worked like that. A piece of equipment you use becomes outdated and "voila", a new updated one arrives at your doorstep. Of course, the downside to that is the fact that I don't actually own my own computer, but I'll deal with that when the time comes.  So this week has been back to the grind as usual. I did go with my sister to see  urlLink Jason Mraz  at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts (which, if you can't imagine already, is an amazing venue for anyone with a decent set of pipes). Before you all make fun of me, I will say that is was well worth it. This guy's got an incredible voice, a really unique style, and a lot of really thought provoking lyrics. If you can get past the radio cuts, his live stuff is worth seeing. Saying that, I will never see him in a venue like that again - good acoustics or not. I was not prepared for the teeming crowds of screaming 15 yr.olds. I would recommend that anyone check him out in  a smaller club/bar like setting where the crowd is 18+ only.  Most impressive was the group of muscians that he brought with him. One in particular, Raul Midon, was this man who was blinded at birth that can play acoustic guitar like no one I have every seen before. He had this way of keeping a whole percussion beat going while he played that blew me away.   The whole show was such an oxymoron. You have this very sophisticated group of musicians playing really amazing music to the most teeny bopperish crowd I have ever been a part of. I just kind of looked around and thought, how can this happen? It was like NSYNC fans showing up at a Jeff Buckley concert because they thought that "Last Goodbye" was sweet when they saw Vanilla Sky because Tom Cruise is hot. Anyways, interesting to say the least. Check out the live stuff if you happen to come accross it. Worth a listen

         So on a whim this weekend, tj and I picked a steamy  urlLink hot  day and headed south for the  urlLink keys . We caught a bunch of that  urlLink smoke  coming from the everglades (which is on fire if you haven't caught the excessive news on it lately), and that was a pretty fantastic sight. Just clouds of smoke miles into the air. Anyway, the idea was to find a place to stay - inexpensively - and then rent a boat the next day to do some spearfishing and snorkeling. We were nearly busted on finding a hotel (there was no room in the inns) when we stumbled accross the  urlLink kon-tiki  resort in  urlLink Islamorada . That was just a little slice of heaven. It was situated right on the  urlLink water  on the west side, had these quaint (and very clean) little cottage style  urlLink rooms , hammocks between palms to lounge in, and this rad salt water fish  urlLink grotto  with tons and tons of  urlLink fish .  urlLink TJ  and I just hung out and  urlLink relaxed . It was perfect.   The next day we got a hold of a 22' center console and headed out to sea. May I remind all of my fellow Floridian friends that we live right next to some of the most beautiful  urlLink water and reefs  in the world. I know that I don't take advantage of it enough. The first reef we stopped and snorkeled was amazing. Just crystal clear aqua water and gobs of funky colorful fish. It was finding nemo 3D. We stopped at 2 other spots before we had to turn the boat in and get home for a wedding shower we were going to.   All and all, lovely and fantastic. Many more trips (planned) to come.

      Ok, I saw  urlLink The Anchorman  tonight. Too friggin' hilarious. I have to say that I was really pleasantly suprised, as I laughed my butt off, at how funny it actually was. They couldn't have had more cameos from more stupid funny people if they tried.  So if you're in the mood for say the absolute antithesis of Farenheit 9/11 spend 20 bucks and go check it out.

           So I just got back from a mini vacay with my partner in crime simone.  urlLink We  spent 4 lovely days in  urlLink Chicago , where the skies were blue and the temps generally did not get up above the low to mid 70's.  The first day, we went to the  urlLink Field  Museum of  urlLink Natural History  (which is where  urlLink sue  lives). We both met these hot tahitian guys and made out with them ( urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 ) - sorry tj!. Simone's trying to get her guy to move down here - something about a sex slave. That night we met up with some friends and hit the Lincoln Park area. We went to this cool irish pub called the  urlLink mystic celt  for dinner - where I got a margatini - the antithesis of irish pub drinks.  The next day mone took me to  urlLink Gino's East  ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) - which is a famous home of original Chicago style deep dish pizza (which i think is still sitting in my stomach with no plans of going anywhere anytime soon). Then we cruised through an art fair downtown and just went building watching. That's where I snapped my fav pic of the trip,  urlLink here . The sunlight was peeking through the surrounding buildings as to hit the cross just so right then. It was really striking.  I spent Saturday with tj's sister in law,  urlLink Sherri , which was great. We shopped the art/architecture district before heading to the newly opened  urlLink Millenium Park  (which if you didn't notice from the name, opened a bit later than scheduled). We headed back to her house afterword to hang with the neighbors and their kids, who I haven't seen in awhile - then to dinner.  All in all, super fun trip. Thanks again mone.

      So TJ and I finally joined the rest of the world and saw Dave Matthews Sat. night with about 25,000 other people. We donned our rain gear and settled into our lawn seats - fighting the thought that if I'm just going to watch it on the jumbo tron, why didn't I just rent the dvd instead of buying tickets? (Because of that, I forced myself to squint and stare at the tiny figures on stage). Really though, it was very good. We both had a great time -people were super nice,  the band played for 2 1/2 hrs., the weather cleared up beautifully, and I can't think of a thing that I could complain about.
