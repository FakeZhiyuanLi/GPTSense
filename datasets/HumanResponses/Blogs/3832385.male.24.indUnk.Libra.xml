      Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night. Every so often I think about it and I shudder. It’s a feeling that haunts me. I don’t like to talk about it. I just shrug it off and try to forget as soon as I remember. I soldier on. What else can you do? I wake up each morning and tell myself I can’t go on, that I must go on. So I go on. And yet sometimes I embrace it. I look down into it and realize that it has to be, this ending, this finality. At these times there are few things that I can do besides want to hide myself from others, so that they can’t see the utter terror on my face and the heaviness in my heart. It’s a feeling we all have and few want to share. And even fewer share in constructive ways that make others feel better about the situation. These few are wise men (and women). And their words sometimes bring me solace. Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. And I guess my greatest worry is that sometimes that I’ll never be able to capture the same sorts of feelings and emotions in my writing. To ever bring to the fore the real issues behind certain pieces of music, whether the artist intended it or not. There are flashes and glimmers every once in a while, I feel. But for the most part it lies flat on the page, leaving impassive readers to their impassive reactions. Even my most accomplished writing, dancing upon the page, leaves me—in those desolate moments—feeling weak and worthless at getting the point across. And even the writers that I most admire sometimes have these feelings. They just hide them better. Wild men, gonzo journalism, concepts rising above their imposed structures to say something more—there are moments of doubt everywhere to be found if you can look hard enough and care to engage with a writer’s entire oeuvre. But usually you don’t. You read the highlights. And the lowlights. And draw your conclusions from there. Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Which is why I don’t fear the present. And I don’t fear the past. And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And it’s why I choose to engage with moments. Perfect moments. Moments that confirm life. Moments that make me smile as I head to an office after a few hours sleep, after working on what I really believe in. Only insincerity would make you believe otherwise. And it’s in these moments, moments that send OTHER shivers down your spine, moments that destroy the monotony of everyday life with their blinding light and humanity and goodness and utter rightness that I can’t believe that they exist. Juno’s “The French Letter” has one of these moments.  todd burns

      Statement: It's not really that insane is it? Response: No, it's not.   TO HAVE BREAKFAST, THE BEST PLACES  first of all, breakfast is kind off a luxury for me,only have breakfast 2 or 3 times a month, is it really possible to go on without breakfast forever?  mcdonalds, anywhere in singapore most probably the only country where you can get a big breakfast meal, my favorite spot is the one opposite marriott hotel, just a little bit on the side of shaw building, quite noisy but all worth it.   dome cafe, burjuman, dubai the meal itself is so so, but the view is just worth it, great place to spend from 7 to 11 am  lotus, pondok indah, jakarta dim sum galore  gran melia, jakarta the compromising choice, a good family spot  nasi kuning, jalan veteran, bandung the tastiest cheepest breakfast ever  i wish i was there to see scissor sisters jake shears stripped himself at this years t in the park  its a gloomy day and i couldnt enjoy it

      when i was reading a review on pan sonic's latest effort the sprawling 4 discs "kesto",i came across a rather unique word,even more peculiar is the fact that the word suggests a deeper understanding for "kesto", that to really understand "kesto" which was said to be heavily inspired by this, we have to know what triptych really is. references to francis bacon was an obvious on my google search result, it seams that he is creator of this triptych word. said is the most arresting and major work from francis bacon is the triptych work from 1962 called the three studies of crucifixion. ive seen all along many triptych works, its interesting how i finally came across what probably the original, never thought that those works that i saw was called a triptych. there are probably many triptych words that i worte here, but i still not come close to any conclusion or any understanding of what the word really means. funny huh. i started with a curiousness towards the word. but what i really want to write is about bacons work. i will promised you that in the future i will explain a little bit more about the word triptych. yes, Francis Bacon Three studies for a Crucifixion 1962 Oil on canvas each panel 197.2 x 147 cm Staatsgalerie Moderner Kunst, Munich odd enough, three work that titled as a study on crucifixion didnt have any crucifix at all. when seeing this for the first time, one could easily came to think, and feel the violent nature of it. for somebody who grow up with too much tv and movie violence like me, it obvious that i would come to a conclusion of a murder scene in the making, or sort of. not the most beautifull sight, but it is beautifull in a sense of a story if there is a story in this work in the first place. triptych are supposed to be based on a singular idea, then, that idea was put to work into three diferent canvass, and if those three canvass are put align, then you could find a flow, more sense to it, sort of like a frame by frame study of a film, or an print from a lomo action sampler, sort of. it seems that this perticular work is suposed to be seen as a flow from left to right, although im not sure weather or not its what the artist expect us to see it that way or not. where i see it, it flows from left to right. the left part shows two person, seen from a view of a third person the victim i supposed, the two person viewed, was viewed from the right side, one person seems laughing as if proud of what he has done, the other was anxious to leave. The scene is inside a circular like room, the victim iying with its back upright, on one side, the opposite side saw a window and a door. the first one seems to establish an aura of curiosity, some questions that come up when looking at it are, what is happening?, where are they going?, where am i?,why is he laughing? and so on... the first one actually suggest us to see the next one. the second one, the one in the center, not always have to be the central piece, but shocking none the less, really up the tension level, a body, disorganized, crouching, naked, bloody, deformed, the head is shown in skull form, while the rest of the body is still flesh, some internal parts are also visible, although not clear which is which, its lying on a bed, white sheets with splatters of blood here and there, the windows in the back are covered with blinds, dark ones, purposedly shut, its hard not to feel a little pity towards it, is it dead? the third and last one up the level of tension another notch, the most appalling, and even more violent than the center one, half human half animal, or is it wholly animal? with an open ribcage, one cant help but think what is this thing? and what is that in the center? is it a head? why is the head placed there? trully uneasy and unaccessible... this account are based on first person first time seeing basis, deffinitely there will be some more in the future
