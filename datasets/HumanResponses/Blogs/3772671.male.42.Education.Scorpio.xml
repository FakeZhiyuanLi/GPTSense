      The Democrats may stage some upsets in Eastern Washington this year. Don Barbieri is running an amazing campaign for the United States House of Representatives. This is the seat that Tom Foley, Democratic Speaker of the House, had for years. When George Nethercutt snatched it away from him, it seemed that it was going to be Republican forever. But now Nethercutt is running against Patty Murray, who is going to trounce him. And Barbieri is charismatic and well financed.  At the more local level, Tom Schmerer is running for the State House. He was running against Dave Mastin, an attractive charismatic fellow who first won as a Democrat and then switched parties. Frankly, Schmerer probably didn't have a chance against Mastin. But then Mastin dropped out, and now Schmerer may have a chance after all

      A number of words have shown in the New York Times of late that are worth mentioning ...   The Good     The word "eyas" turns out to be a young falcon. The plural is "eyases." Cool. See  urlLink "For Falcons as for People, Life in the Big City Has Its Risks as Well as Its Rewards,"  Monday, June 28.    The Bad   I don't know where this term "safehouse" is coming from. On Sunday, the Times reported that "the American military launched an airstrike hours later on what it called a Falluja safehouse for fighters in his network." Aren't we just talking about a house where our opponents are living? Is there really a house that is marked as a "safehouse" for terrorists? Or isn't it the case that almost any hosue in Falluja would be willing to harbour our opponents? In any case, I would think of a "safehouse" as basically a good thing, a place where battered women could go, for instance.    The Ugly   Finally, there is Edward Rothstein's peculiar use of the word "Judenrein" in an article about the globalization of soccer  urlLink ("Globalize Soccer? Not in Your Lifetime, Chum," Saturday, June 26) . He writes: "In Budapest, a soccer team called MTK Hungaria, founded in 1888 by Jews and long since Judenrein, is jeered by opponents with taunting banners: 'The trains are leaving for Auschwitz.'" First of all, I wonder, is it a safe bet that Americans, even educated New York Times-reading ones, know what the word "Judenrein" means? It means "free of Jews" and is seriously tainted by the Holocaust. I'm sure Rothstein is using the word with in a knowing ironic way, but I think it's odd or even ugly to use it as though it were a normal word.

      There's an interesting review of a German novel about the 18th-century thinker Lichtenberg in the  Chronicle of Higher Education . The novel,  Lichtenberg and the Little Flower Girl , is by Gert Hoffman.   urlLink   urlLink The Review  urlLink   certainly brings out the clever, witty, insightfulness of Lichtenberg's aphorisms. It puts more of an emphasis on his heterosexuality than I do in my chapter on Lichtenberg's aphorisms in  Warm Brothers . Lichtenberg married a 13 year old (the "little flower girl" of the title), which I think qualifies on some level as queer.

      I am more and more convinced that the AIDS crisis had a powerful influence on Alan Ball as he conceived of "Six Feet Under," even though he didn't respond to my question to that effect on "Ask Alan Ball" at the  urlLink Six Feet Under website   urlLink  . In yesterday's episode (#42, Parallel Play), Brenda and Joe use a condom, which is a reminder of the presence of AIDS. In another recent episode, Nan Goldin's photography inspires Claire--and Nan's photography featured people living with AIDS quite prominently. This evidence perhaps seems a little weak, but it is part of a pattern that has continued since the series began. I'm currently working on an essay on the subject.  Otherwise, I'm a little concerned by some of the plot lines. I don't like the direction that Freddy's heading!

      I've actually got a lot to say about gay marriage, but for starters I think it's interesting to speculate on some of the changes that might come about if gays were allowed to marry ....  For instance, are we going to see a generation of gay men who are saving themselves for marriage?

      This a bit obscure for many of you I'm sure, but I have lots of friends in Germany for whom this is big news.   A few years ago, the Social Democratic government put into place some educational reforms. They created "junior professorships" which would be open to academics who had not completed the "habilitation."  The "habilitation" is essentially a second dissertation that was traditionally a requirement for a professorship. So you wrote your dissertation to get your doctorate, which would qualify you for a position as an assistant professor. It was not uncommon to become an assistant professor at the institution where you completed your dissertation.  Then you would write your habilitation while you were an assistant professor in order to be qualified for a full professorship. The Germans did not have the tenure-track system, so it was unlikely that you would become a full professor where you were an assistant.   The big disadvantage to the habilitation is that it keeps young academics in a subservient position until they are middle aged. Not only do you have to write your habilitation, you have to get it approved. So here you are, in your late 30s or early 40s, kowtowing to some senior professor.  However, the habilitation system is not as different from America as many German scholars imagined. In fact, if you are at a quality university in the United States, you will have to produce a significant body of research after the dissertation in order to get tenure and become a full professor.   So we have a de facto habilitation, but without the humilating accoutrements of advisors and committees that can decide not to accept a habilitation. However, even in this respect, the differences are not so huge--the tenure committee could decide that it didn't think that a second book was very good or of a sufficient academic quality, even if it had been published.  The bottom line is that the habilitation was not the reason for Germany's problems in higher education. The article notes that the habilitation meant that few people became full professors until their early 40s--but that's the same in the US as well. Lots of people don't finish their dissertations until they are in their mid 30s, and then it takes ten years to get promoted to full professor.   I am in favor of getting rid of the habilitation, but this court decision is not the end of the world for German education.   urlLink The Chronicle: Daily news: 07/30/2004 -- 06

      I've been watching the convention as I prepare to move to New York. I'll actually be in New York City for the Republicans, but I'm having to watch the Democrats from my own living room.  Despite what everyone has been saying, I've found it pretty exciting. Yesterday I watched the Clintons speak. I just don't think Hillary has the presence to be a national political figure. But Bill is great. He looks like he's lost weight. And even  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  thought his speech was jaw-droppingly good.   CLINTON AT HIS BEST: Carter's was the better speech, but Clinton was magnificent. I think he was better last night than at either of his own conventions and certainly better than any of his SOTUs. He performed a brilliant rhetorical trick: he deployed the usual canards used against him to buttress Kerry. Rather than attack the wealthy as recjpients of tax cuts, he attacked himself as a now-wealthy man. And then the coup de grace: he put himself and Bush in the same camp as draft-dodgers, in stark comparison to the patriotic Kerry! My jaw was on the floor at that point in a mixture of admiration and horror. But it was mighty effective. And the way in which he described the cost of the tax cut in terms of squandered attempts to improve homeland defense was another smart move. Use the Republican tax cut issue against the Republican security issue. Wedge against them for once. If the constitution didn't prevent it, the man would still be president. After last night's speech, you can see why.    In fact, in general, I like Sullivan's comments on the conference and it's been a while since I've liked his writing. Sullivan also agrees that Barak Obama was fantastic. He is smart and sensible and attractive.   We listened to Kennedy on the radio. I didn't mind his talk, but others found it tiresome. Ron Reagan, Jr., was good, I thought. He looks a lot like his father.

      This is a magnificent quartet that we heard in Portland, on our way to the coast for a family reunion. My sister Mary Sue is the saxophonist. We've been trying to describe the sound of the music, which is described as "avant-garde, third-stream" jazz.   For some reason, film noir has dominated my thoughts while listening to her music. So I would say the music is sometimes smoky and intoxicating like the fine single malt scotch, maybe Oban, that I suspect they're drinking in film noir. Othertimes it's sassy and bright like the dame in a red dress, matching high heels, and a new hat who comes into the detective's office (of course, since the film is black and white, you just have to imagine the red dress, but you can tell by her panache). Othertimes it's rough and gravelly, like the voice of one of the witnesses that they meet in a smoke-filled bar. And othertimes it's tight and tailored, like the suits with hats that the men wear.    urlLink Mary Sue Tobin    urlLink Tugboat , the bar where Paxselin was playing, is a great venue, with home-brewed beer, book-lined wallls (although it's hard to imagine someone reading in such a dark space), and reasonably-priced good food. when we were there the street outside was lit by a street light and was actually brighter than the bar. So, from the bar, you could see people walking up and down the street, which is narrow, almost like an alley. They would stop outside the window and look inside and listen the music before moving on.

      This is a quite intelligent column about the difficulties facing German universities. I think you have to subscribe to  The Chronicle  in order to read the article, so I'll tell you briefly what some of his points are:  He is very critical of the reasoning behind the German drive to develop programs in bachelor's degrees. As he puts it, the Germans are turning to bachelor's degrees to save money, not to create the kind of coherent fundamental education that the best American programs offer.  He also scoffs at the idea that German alumni are going to start contributing wildly to their alma mater. They don't bond emotionally with their home institution and they don't have a tradition of public philanthropy.  He argues that German universities need to be able to develop their own specialities and areas of expertise, which means they need to be able to cut down on areas that aren't particularly good. Students also need to be able to choose where they want to go.   urlLink The Chronicle: 7/30/2004: Aspiring to Steeples of Excellence at German Universities

      This  urlLink New York Times  article gives a surprisingly sympathetic account of the difficulties facing gay Republicans. Some people are even threatening to *out* them!  The best reasoning on outing is still in Richard D. Mohr's  Gay Ideas: Outing and Other Controversies . His main argument is that one has to out if one wants to remain an honest person. You may want me to keep a secret, but you don't have the right to make me lie, just to protect your secret.  He also makes a useful distinction between privacy and secrecy. Even though John Kerry, John Edwards, George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney all frequently allude to their marital status, no one believes that the public has a reasonable right to know what these married couples do in bed. That is to say, they certainly have a right to privacy.   But the public would quite justifiably find it very strange to discover halfway through a political campaign that a politician was married, but had never revealed this fact. The public would think that this politician was keeping secrets, not guarding his privacy.   So by the same token, it's not OK to keep your sexuality a secret, although it is appropriate to maintain a sphere of privacy around the details of that sexuality.   urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Proposed Marriage Ban Splits Washington's Gays

      I've been trying to publish an op-ed piece on this subject for months, but have given up and decided to publish it myself. So there! Seriously, this was one of the reasons for developing my own blog. So here it is ...       Gays, Marriage, and Civil Rights  Robert Tobin, Whitman College   Although the Federal Marriage Amendment has been stopped in the Senate, its backers vow to return to the matter next year. In the meantime, supporters of the amendment intend to take up the matter in the House of Representatives and plan to push a flurry of referenda against gay marriage in the individual states. Perhaps this would be a good time to step back and take a look at the history of homosexuality, marriage, and civil rights. In fact, this debate is not new: calls for gay marriage are as old as the concept of homosexuality itself.    In order to have gay marriage, you need to have gay people. The statement may seem obvious, but for much of human history, people were not categorized as homosexual or heterosexual. But once you have categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals—and the people in those categories are classified neither as criminals nor as mentally ill—then it becomes very hard to deny them the rights granted to other citizens.    1869 is often considered the “birth of the homosexual.” In that year, the German-Hungarian liberal activist Karl Maria Kertbeny coined the term “homosexuality” in an appeal to the Prussian Minister of Justice to decriminalize sodomy.    Significantly, the term appeared in the context of the political debate about the shaping of the new nation of Germany, which was to be established in 1871. Liberals such as Kertbeny wanted to be sure that equal rights would apply to the newly minted category of the homosexual.    Kertbeny’s ally on many of these issues was a Hannoverian lawyer named Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. In the 1860s and ‘70s, Ulrichs published a series of brochures demanding rights for men who loved men and women who loved women, whom he called “urnings” and “urningins” respectively. Not only did Ulrichs fight for the rights of urnings, he also came out as one, both to his family and—astonishingly—to the 1867 meeting of the Association of German Jurists in Munich.    In 1870, Ulrichs published the first issue of what he hoped would become a journal called Prometheus for his fellow urnings and urningins. In it, he argues for the biological nature of sexual identity and calls for coalitions between urnings and other oppressed minorities of religious and racial groups, including Jews and Catholics.   At the same time, he wants to know why the state and the church cannot sanction the union of urnings, as it sanctions the union of men and women. If there are individuals with an innate predisposition to love members of their own sex, he asserts they should be allowed to marry. Already in 1870, there are explicit calls for gay marriage.    Kertbeny and Ulrichs were both far ahead of their time. Sodomy remained illegal in the new German state and stayed that way for a century. Gay marriage had to wait even longer before it became the subject of political debate again.    Nonetheless, there are some lessons that deserve to be learned from this chapter in the history of sexuality. Once homosexuals are no longer considered criminal or mentally ill, it becomes hard to deny them the rights granted other members of society. Far-sighted liberals like Kertbeny and Ulrichs saw that over a century ago, and a slim majority of our senators seem to understand it now.        There's  urlLink a very thorough webpage on Ulrichs . Not much on Kertbeny, until I get on with my own writing!

      I think I warned people from the outset that I had a lot to say on the subject of gay marriage. I'd like to take a look at the matter from another angle--the liberal/libertarian angle.  The initial liberal/libertarian response to gay marriage would be, what the heck is the state doing involved with any marriage? Marriage is a religious rite, and one of the bedrocks of our political system is the separation of church and state. We like the separation of church and state, because, for instance,&nbsp;we don't want the state requiring all of the women in the country to wear burkas, as the recently deposed theocracy in Afghanistan did. So the state should generally avoid promoting religious belief systems. And as such, it should stay out of the marriage business.  Of course, our government does have a history of getting involved with marriage, even though it's religious. The government, for instance, didn't allow polygamy. I have to confess I don't know the history of the government's opposition to polygamy, but I could image liberal/libertarian acquiescence in the government's prohibition of polygamy&nbsp;based on the idea of the protection of the rights of the women involved. Nowadays, it would seem that most people don't get too worked up about a man having relations with a number of consenting adult women, but they do get pretty upset at the idea of young teenage girls getting forced into polygamous marriages. So again, there would seem to be no reason--from a liberal/libertarian point of view--to reject marriages between consenting adult men.  But the state may have reasons of its own for being interested in partnerships. It would like to know, for instance, which people are responsible for a certain child, or who is responsible for their partner when the partner gets sick. This is the rational liberal (if not libertarian) explanation for the state's involvement in issues of partnership. In fact, I think the rational liberal (and perhaps libertarian) response would be for the state to grant only domestic partnerships, and leave marriage to the churches.   urlLink A large number of corporations, universities, and government agencies  now offer benefits to domestic partners. Right now, it requires a fair amount of work on the part of these private and public entities in order to determine who is a partner and who isn't. I can imagine that these corporatations, institutions, and agencies would love for the state to determine who is and who isn't a domestic partner. They might in fact start pressuring states to take over the responsibility of monitering domestic partnerships. Libertarians might not like it, but liberals (who, at least in their classic manifestation, tend to be supportive of business) will find this to be one more reason to support governmental acknowledgement of civil unions for gays and lesbians.   urlLink HRC Ad   urlLink Lynn Cheney   urlLink Gay Marriage

      Now for something different ... I do not get the sense that the authorities are particularly concerned about the safety and health of consumers. Anytime there's a mad cow disease scare, the government seems most concerned about the financial health of the ranchers and the meat processing industry. Shouldn't they be more concerned about those of us who eat the meat?  This article from the Seattle Times explains how few samples have come in to the agency that is trying to determine if there is even a problem. No one has an incentive to submit samples, because they'll just be closed down if it turns out that one of their cows is infected.   urlLink The Seattle Times: Local News: Trickle of samples fails to meet goal at WSU mad-cow testing lab

      So I tried to send this once before--it's my letter to the editor of the  urlLink Walla Walla Union Bulletin .   I was responding to&nbsp; urlLink this odious column by Kathleen Parker , who is one of those so-called "compassionate conservatives."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Since they don't publish letters to the editor on line, I'll copy it here ....  &nbsp;    Kathleen Parker’s tirades against gay marriage are illogical and far too simplistic. Most recently (July 9, 2004), she asserts that gay marriage will harm children and that fathers should be particularly upset about this development.  &nbsp;  She lumps together all men who have children into one group, ignoring for instance those gay men who have had children and want to be a parent to their children.  &nbsp;  In fact, we all know people who turned out wonderfully even though they were raised in nontraditional ways, just as we all also know people who had terrible upbringings in traditional families.  &nbsp;  Actually, Parker should realize that sex and gender roles do not necessarily overlap in neat stereotypical ways. There may be feminine men and masculine women. Children obviously their gender roles from a variety of sources, not just from some 1950s television sit com model.  &nbsp;  Most importantly, it should be noted that in many states, including Washington, gay couples can already serve as foster parents and adopt children. By all accounts, they have done as good a job of parenting as anyone else. Why shouldn’t those couples be allowed to marry if they believe it is important to their children and families?       I got some nice responses from some people, and some noncommittal acknowledgement by others that they had seen my letter. &nbsp; &nbsp; Earlier gay marriage observations: &nbsp;  urlLink HRC Ad   urlLink Lynn Cheney   urlLink Gay Marriage  &nbsp;

      Well, we finally got to see  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  on Thursday. It's in Tri-Cities, about an hour away from here. Apparently, it's not going to show at all in Walla Walla, according to an article in today's  urlLink  Walla Walla Union Bulletin   .  This is a little bit ironic actually, because Walla Walla is probably a more liberal community than Tri-Cities. &nbsp; The owner of our local movie theater claims that the decision is purely economic, but others say that he's a conservative. I guess the economic problems with showing the film are compelling--apparently you need to book the film for a four-week run, which means that the&nbsp;not-for-profit community&nbsp;cinema in Dayton can't show it.&nbsp;And&nbsp;I guess the DVD is coming out shortly anyway.  In any case, we liked Fahrenheit 9/11 so much that we went back again last night, and brought two friends.&nbsp; I think that at the most basic level, the film points to a crisis of confidence in the character of the president. One could imagine a president who legitimately believed that he was doing the right thing for the country. But unfortunately some of us suffer under the constant doubt that this president and his family might really be willing to change the course of history, to steal the election in Florida, bankrupt the country and loot the treasury, merely so that his family and friends could gain a few hundred million.&nbsp; I suppose conservatives had the same doubts about the character of Clinton. But I, for one, am not willing to eliminate my doubts about Bush. &nbsp; After having seen it twice, here is my list of some of the most striking moments in the film:&nbsp;     Ickiest moment:  Paul Wolfowitz looking like a lounge lizard, pushing his hair into place with saliva. That's just the icky build-up to the ickiest second--when Wolfowitz's aide contributes some of his own spit to help put his boss's hair into place.   Unfair critique : I know a lot of people might think that the whole film is unfair, but I didn't. I did think it was unreasonable to criticize Bush too much for continuing his visit of the classroom while the World Trade Centers were being hit. He didn't know what was going on and he probably knew that the visit to the classroom would be over soon. However, I should add that Michael Moore points out that President Bush had been warned just a month earlier that Bin Laden was prepared to attack within the United States and he knew that the Twin Towers were a target for terrorists. And President Clinton said in a recent interview that he immediately knew it was Bin Laden as soon as he heard about it.   Least adequately explained mystery:  I am utterly baffled as to why all those Saudis and Bin Ladens got to leave the United States as soon as the attacks took place. Prince Bandar's explanation, that His Majesty, the King of Saudi Arabia,&nbsp;didn't want them to be inconvenienced, makes the whole matter even less clear. Why should His Majesty have a say in this at all? As Moore points out, what would have happened if Clinton had arranged to have all of Timothy McVay's family flown out of the country within days of the Oklahoma bombing.   Surprising Factoid:  The idea that the Saudis own 6-7% of the country was interesting. There seemed to be a little slippage between ownership of the country and ownership of equity in the stock exchange. I think the 6-7% refers to the stock exchange, which is still a surprising figure.   Funniest pop culture allusions:  well, there are actually quite a few. For starters, framing Afghanistan as an episode of Bonanza, was very cleverly done. But I think I liked the hip use of the Talking Head's "Shiny, Happy People" as background for the footage of the Bushes and the Sauds and the Bin Ladens socializing, and "Come On, Party People, Put Your Hands in the Air" as background to the anti-American demonstrations in Iraq.   Deconstructive moments:  As many critics have noted, at the beginning of the film, we see outtakes of Bush White House officials getting prepared for television appearances and at the end we see them taking off their microphones. This does seem to underscore the theatricality, the constructedness of politics. The constant references to pop culture that show both the Bush team and Moore and his audience relying on culturally produced precedents to respond to current events again shows how the "real world" of politics and even war is affected by art. Interestingly, there is a moment where someone accuses Moore's movie of being staged--and at that moment, and that moment only, we see one of the cameras from Moore's film. It's as though Moore is inviting us to think about what it would mean for his movie to be staged.   Moments showing the documentary filmmaker's skill :&nbsp;A lot of people find Lila Lipscomb's story the most moving part of the movie. She's the working class woman whose son died in Iraq. Filmically, her story is also very well done. We meet her first in the context of unemployment in Flint and the attraction of the military. Only later do we learn that her son is in the military and it is even later that we learn that he has died. Now, when Moore is putting together his documentary, he obviously already knows that her son is dead. So he consciously structures it so that we gradually learn about Lila&nbsp;Lipscomb's story. (Similarly, we learn somewhat early that she wears a multicolored cross&nbsp; because she supports multiculturalism--later we meet her family and realize that her husband is Black.)&nbsp; We can also assume that Moore knows her story before she talks on camera--bringing up once again the charge that everything is staged. But this is also a part of the documentary filmmaker's skill: getting untrained non-actors to spill their guts in front of the camera.    Gruesome moments : The footage of the American soldiers being burned and dragged and&nbsp;the footage of the Iraqi kids being wounded all speak for themselves. The fact that our media refuses to show the true experience of war is terrible. Similarly, the footage of the American amputees should be seen by many more people   Ugly moments:  The young American soldiers who talk about blasting heavy metal as they roll around Baghdad in their tanks sure are unappealing.   Politically brilliant moment : Michael Moore's attempt to get the congressmen and senators to encourage their kids to enlist in the military and go help out in Iraq is delicious, as are the responses of the politicians.   Possibly elitist moment : Moore quite accurately underscores how ironic it is that the least privileged Americans are the most likely to serve in the military. He says that "they are fighting for us." Who is this "us"? Does it mean that he's assuming that the underclass is not going to watch his film? That he doesn't need to appeal to that audience?   Bush's elitist moment : His jokes about the haves and the have-mores and "some may call you the elite, I call you my bases" are actually pretty funny.   Moments showing Bush's appeal : it's obvious Bush has a sense of humor and mischief. Moore tries to make it look like Bush doesn't have the gravitas to be President, but I think you can see that a lot of people might like Bush's jokey style.   Cheney's Darth Vader Impersonation:  he calls for the total destruction of something or other. Very scary.   Most interesting new fact : Like most lefties, I had a general knowledge of most of Moore's charges against the Bush administration (although I didn't have all the details of the links between the Bushes and the Saudis at my fingertips). But what was genuinely new to me was that the Bush administration is on record as having claimed prior to Sept. 11 that Iraq was not a danger to the US and that sanctions were working. Of course we all know that Bush Senior and Rumsfeld actively supported Hussein back in the 80s.   Moment of difficulty with proverbial sayings : Bush has trouble at the end getting the old saying right, "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me." He finally gives us and just says, "we can't get fooled again." Oh well, I always thought that was a kind of difficult phrase too!   The theater wasn't crowded, but it wasn't empty. We ran into a couple of Walla Wallans there. Our friends said they wanted to send the movie to their parents.

      We went to the  urlLink Liberty , a lovely restored old theater in incipiently hip downtown Dayton, to watch Spielberg's  The Terminal , the Tom Hanks film.  The film was much better than I expected--a very kafkaesque nightmare of a central European mensch trapped in a modernist bureacracy.   There were also some fascinating Spielbergesque moments as well. In one scene, Tom Hanks is expressing his love to Catherine Zeta Jones, and the image is just full of glowing shining light, like "E.T." And ultimately, the film is about going home, just like "E.T."  Interestingly, jazz played an important role in the motitavtion of the Hanks character.  Still, it wasn't a masterpiece. Many characters just didn't add up. The guy who ran the airport seemed to verge on the irrationally sadistic at times. And Catherine Zeta Jones's character was infuriatingly self-centered.

      Walla Walla has been undergoing a dining revolution in the last several years. The most recent entry in the entree business is  urlLink 26 brix , which we visited the other day with friends from Spokane.   It's in the Dacres Hotel, a classic old building in Walla Walla that used to be a brothel at one point in its history. Everything's remodeled beautifully, including the men's room, which has enormous old urinals that are practically as big as stalls and a very modern sink that consists of a flat blue slab that catches the water as it flows.  The hostess was a little distant, giving the place a bit of attitude. The waiters were extremely attentive, almost overly anxious to please. They kept asking if I liked things, and I almost felt bad when I couldn't rave. It probably had to do with the fact that a lot of them were Whitman students and knew me from that context. The menu was the kind of menu requiring a lot of explanation, which the waiters provided. They also gave tips on how to eat the food (i.e., "try to include all five flavors of the dessert in each mouthful").  So how was the food? I had a lobster bisque that had a very strong taste, almost burnt, but in a good, intentional way, perhaps a bit too salty. I have to say I really enjoyed it. That was followed by "day boat scallops" (meaning that they were fresh that day, according to the staff), on a bed of vegetables, with black truffles. Very tasty.  Dessert was a delight. I had a strawberry tart that was light and tasty. Others had a "chocolate tour" (probably the most decadent) and watermelon soup (probably the most pleasant surprise).   It's at the high end of Walla Walla dining, with entrees in the $30 + range. With the soup, dessert, drinks and coffee, it was an expensive meal.  The bar, by the way, looks very hip.

      This might seem like a dull entry, but this story in the  New York Times  about the ways in which the railroad companies try to wriggle out of responsibility for deaths at railroad crossings is a brilliant piece of muckraking. It begins with an account about a death here in Eastern Washington. After the death, someone from the railroad company snuck in and secretly replaced a defective piece of equipment. Only when an attentive trial lawyer noticed that the serial numbers on the equipment didn't match up with the reports was the fraud uncovered. It makes your blood boil.

      The  urlLink  Chronicle of Higher Education   has an extensive article about  urlLink Germany's plan to build elite universities . Not surprisingly, it's not going all that well. Too many entrenched bureacratic hindrances. I'm not sure how Germany is going to regain its momentum. The thing is, I don't think things  are  all that bad to start with. The German academics I know are hard working productive scholars who are also very devoted teachers. It probably doesn't surprise you to hear that they are always publishing articles in obscure journals of the Lichtenberg Society, but--if you have American stereotypes about Germans--you would be astonished to hear that they are also inviting their students over for end-of-the-semester parties and genuinely concerned about their students' futures. The students are well-trained in the schools and are particularly good at foreign languages. And there is a long tradition of academic excellence. So the raw materials are all there.   The problem is that the universities are underfinanced. I remember going to lectures taught by Kenzaburo Oe at Berlin's  urlLink Freie Universitaet . It was triste! He taught in this temporary building with grafitti on it.   I wonder if part of the problem is that Germany has only public universities, so there isn't that competition. In the States, the public universities can go to their legislatures and say, "We're falling behind the privates!" Finally, though, globalization may mean that this kind of competition is taking place. The German universities are able to argue that they're falling behind the univerities of other schools.  The other concern that I have is that the Social Democrats may not be very good for higher education in Germany. Really, the best universities are in the Christian Democrat states (Baden-Wuerttemburg and Bavaria). As a lefty from an old union family, it pains me to admit this, but it seems that the very labor-oriented Social Democrats in Germany have tended to neglect academic excellence out of fear that it would be too elitist. (And indeed, the very notion of the "elite" university is controversial in Germany.)

      Had a great time this weekend--friends took us boating on the Snake. We toodled around Lewiston and Clarkston and down to Asotin. There was a weird, nearly mythological scene: a bird of prey of some kind attacking a young blue heron. My friends were afraid that it was going to get the heron, but it didn't.   Once the sun set, we watched the fireworks over Lewiston and Clarkston. Very impressive, except that that they were choreographed to nasty music: country settings of Bush sounding presidential. We actually heard the same song in Safeway the other day, and a friend asked if we were in East Germany, what with all this propaganda bombarbing us.   Late in the evening, we headed back to Chief Timothy Reservoir, where we had parked the pick-up. Its lights didn't work, so we had to camp, impromptu. We had a bottle of wine, and then tried to sleep in the boat and the back of the pick-up for a couple of hours, until daybreak. It was a memorable finish to a wonderful day.  I can't say I felt proud to be an American--after all, what did I do to become an American? But I did feel lucky to live in such a beautiful country.

      Just finished reading N.O. Body's memoir of growing up as a girl only to discover that she was actually a boy. Her doctor misdiagnosed her sex. Apparently this happens more often than you would think. "Nora" spent her youth suffering under the limitations of growing up as a girl: she couldn't do the same things the guys could do, wasn't able to study as much, etc. She got very involved in the woman's movement. She wrote essays and lectured on women's rights throughout central Europe. Personally, her youth was troubled, though, by her discomfort with her body. She never developed breasts and didn't menstruate. She had feelings for other women, but not for men. Finally, she fell madly in love with a woman and confided her feelings in her doctor. This was of course not the same doctor who had misdiagnosed her as a child. He took a look and realized she was actually a man.   All of this is fascinating in its own right, but in the afterword by Hermann Simon, we discover that N.O. Body was a pseudonym for Karl M. Baer, who had been Martha Baer (hence the "M" in her name). She was very involved in Jewish organizations, and had actually done her work for women's rights under the auspices of Bne Briss, which is known in the States as B'nai B'rith. Most of her work was actually in combatting the trade in women. The fact that when she comes out as a man, she goes into the closet as a Jew is fascinating.  N.O. Body's book is currently available only in German: "Aus eines Mannes Maedchenjahren."

Otherwise there are dog runs that he can run in, which are a bit sad, but are filled with other dogs. The City itself is endlessly interesting for a four-legged creature with a good nose. He spends lots of time smelling. He saw a rat the other day, which was almost as good as a squirrel. And he likes to lunge at the pigeons, which are so lazy, indolent, and insolent that they linger and loiter on the sidewalk until he's within an inch or two of them. We're using his walks to help discover the City. Besides Riverside Park, we've explored northern Central Park and Morningside Park--both of which I think used to be considered super dangerous, but which are now totally lovely.

      Here's a glorious photo of the Greek winners of the synchronized diving competition. (I tried to post it directly, but the Hello program that I use for that wasn't cooperating.)   urlLink Yahoo%21 News - Sports Photos - Reuters   I've been watching and enjoing the Olympics enormously, but it is disillusioning how closely related to wealth athletic success is. The countries with large economies field gigantic teams, whereas countries like Congo, with 60 million people, can only send out a couple of athletes. I guess this really became obvious on the South African team, where the majority of the athletes are white although the majority of the citizens of South African are of course black. So the Olympics is one of those supposed meritocracies that really go back to economics. Typical nineteenth-century liberalism. But what can you do?

      Graham Robb.  Strangers: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century . New York: Norton, 2003.  Over the summer, I finally got the chance to read this book, which made quite a splash in the last year as an accessible introduction to the history of sexuality. There was quite a stink on one of my listservs about  urlLink Adam Goodheart’s review in the New York Times (March 7, 2004),  because it actually seemed to imply that the “fortunate circumstances” of Robb’s heterosexuality and his non-academic background gave more credence to his work, as though queer scholars just couldn’t be believed. Fortunately, Caroline Rupprecht wrote in to the Times to remind its readers of the extensive amount of scholarly work upon which Robb had built his edifice ( urlLink March 28, 2004).  She even mentioned my name, which pretty much made my day!  So I did get around to reading Robb’s book, which is indeed an accessible, informative, and witty contribution to the subject of same-sex desire in the nineteenth century. His major point is that there were active subcultures focussed on same-sex desire throughout Europe in the nineteenth century and that the members of these subcultures enjoyed relatively pleasant lives. He thinks that the reliance of much previous scholarship on police records and medical journals has painted a far too dismal picture of the life of nineteenth-century men who loved men. As he asserts, “nineteenth-century homosexuals lived under a cloud, but it seldom rained” (30). As he points out, the persecution of homosexuals increased in the twentieth century, which leads him to the brink of implying things were actually better for men who loved men in the nineteenth century than they are in the present.  In raising objections to the overuse of medical records for understanding the history of homosexuality, Robb is implicitly taking on Foucault and his legacy. His basically essentialist assumption that homosexuality and homosexuals have always existed further sharpens his stance against Foucault.  Most of his evidence regarding the “homosexuals” of nineteenth-century America, England and Europe will be well known to scholars of the subject, but there are bound to be new details for even the most knowledgeable. I had no idea, for instance, that Thomas Jefferson had called for piercing the noses of lesbians with large holes! Those new to the subject will be quite knowledgeable when they finish the book.  It is clear that we know much more about nineteenth-century European subcultures based on same-sex desire than Foucault did when he was writing the History of Sexuality, so Foucault’s constructivism—the notion that homosexuality was born in 1869—certainly needs nuancing and revising.  Robb is also correct in moving us away from the sense of nineteenth-century homosexuals as victims of nineteenth-century medical and judicial institutions. In this he follows in the footsteps of scholars such as Harry Oosterhuis, whose biography of Richard von Krafft-Ebing emphasizes how much agency the homosexual patients of the sexologists had.  At a few points, I found Robb’s work less satisfying. He claims at the beginning of the book that he wants to break out of the Anglo-American tradition, but he doesn’t really get very in-depth in the European tradition. The French tradition is obviously the most comfortable non-English one for him, and I learned from his references to French materials. But his work on Germany was very sketchy. I would be surprised if he did any original work on the subject.  As a literary scholar, it was gratifying for me to see that the conclusion of the entire book was an in-depth analysis of works of literature: the detectives in Edgar Alan Poe and Sherlock Holmes. Robb argues convincingly that these detectives with their sidekicks are queer (although he doesn’t use the “q” word). He makes it sound like he’s the first person to have made this point with regard to Poe and he implies that gay studies has generally ignored the question. I don’t research American or British nineteenth-century literature, so I can’t say with any certainty that he’s wrong, but I suspect he is. His general point is well-taken, however: that nineteenth-century male couples could lead generally happy, domestic lives that were relatively well adjusted socially.

      National Coverage  What agencies, institutions, and companies blanket the country with their products, and what ones fail? Quite a few private institutions give up the ghost in the inner mountain area.  Bank of America: I didn’t find one between Missoula and Kansas City  Sprint: Didn’t offer coverage from Missoula to Kansas City, and is not working in the Appalachians either.  Chevron: Quite scarce from Missoula to Kansas City  The New York Times: the last time we travelled across the country, I couldn’t find the Times between Walla Walla and Iowa City. But this time, we found it in small footholds almost everywhere. We didn’t get it today, but that’s because we didn’t really look. I’m sure we could have found it in Louisville. And we didn’t get it on Saturday, when we were in KC, but we could have—we got the Sunday Times there.  NPR: While the Times holes up in liberal bastions like Missoula, Jackson, or Laramie,  NPR is really almost everywhere. So you can get intelligent, liberal opinion everywhere.   CNN/Fox/Networks: Cable is everywhere, so you can also get bad reporting and inane shows. Fortunately, where there is cable, there is HBO so you can get good Sunday night television.  Espresso/Latte: Despite the idea that latte is a vice of the effete Blue States, in fact we saw drive-through espresso and latte stands everywhere. The baddest cowboys in the biggest, dustiest pick-ups seemed to be just as likely to stop there as professionals in European cars.  Safeway: Provides every kind of product you could imagine everywhere in the U.S. The most remote places we travelled had Safeways with bagels and blue berries and every other exotic delicacy.

      We drove quickly through the midwest, on the interstate most of the time. It was lovely—lush, rolling, green hills, with lots of hardwood trees. The countryside looked prosperous, well-tended, tidy. But we needed to make up for lost time, so we drove through southern Illinois and Indiana.   Kentucky had even more of these positive traits. The countryside is just luscious. We drove by a retirement ranch for thoroughbred horses. The city of Louisville looked surprisingly glamorous too. It has some stunning skyscrapers.   We stopped to eat in Lexington, and found a very good Indian restaurant. Moritz had to stay in the car  of course while we were eating, but we did walk through the town with him. It’s very old. Transylvania University is there, and it is one of the oldest private colleges in the country, founded in 1780.   Although Kentucky looks great from the highway, when you get up close there is a feeling of decay about many of the buildings. Although the weather has been very pleasant for much of this trip, it felt tropically humid in Lexington, which added to the sense that the foundations of the mansions were rotting.  I exaggerate a bit, of course.  We’re now in West Virginia. We wanted to get to West Virginia today so that we could spend some time in the Appalachians.tomorrow.

      This wild story of the resignation of the governor of New Jersey because it has come out that he was gay is full of implications regarding privacy, sexuality and homosexuality. The fact that the governor's affair threatened to blackmail him makes this a story that would have been at home in the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries. Too bad that it is still true in the twenty-first century.   urlLink Yahoo! News - N.J. Governor Resigns, Admits Gay Affair

       Subjective Impressions of Towns on our Trip    Lewiston/Clarkton : I discovered these cities for the first time really earlier this summer, when we spent the 4th of July there. I think they’re just fantastic. Established at the confluence of substantial rivers (the Snake, the Clearwater), they have a varied topography and enough of their late nineteenth-century heritage to have a historical feel. I’m sure they are totally republican, but they still feel quite comfortable.   Missoula:  I’ve liked Missoula for a long time. When I first got my job at Whitman, a friend got a job at the University of Montana in Missoula. We compared notes from time to time, and concluded that I had the better employer, but she had a better location. This time through, my good feelings about the town were confirmed. “The Raven,” which I mentioned in an earlier entry, was a great place to stop for tapas in the evening. An artist was hanging his photographs, while people enjoyed good beer, wine, food, and free internet access. There seemed to be other good restaurants in the old downtown area. You can get The New York Times, albeit at a 100% surcharge. “Fahrenheit 9/11” was playing in a local theater. Lots of long-haired, environmentalist types were walking about. One thing about Missoula, though, is that it is remote from real urban culture. I remember once calculating that we in Walla Walla were in a five-hour orbit from Seattle, where you could have access to a major university library, lots of interesting food, and high-priced hair cuts.  Missoula doesn’t have any place closer than Walla Walla, so they are actually in a ten-hour orbit, which makes them about as remote as can be and still be in the continental United States.   Butte : I’ve never liked Butte and didn’t have any reason to change my mind this time. We stayed in a Super 8 on the outskirts of town and awoke to the sight of splendid nature marred by the concrete outbuildings of the city. Our building was one of the offenders.    Dillon : We stopped in Dillon at the Safeway for breakfast. I’m afraid I’ll always think of it as a city with dirt roads. They were presumably repairing their main street, but to us it felt like the wild west, before the discovery of asphalt. Only the fact that you could get mangoes and blueberries and bagels and organic shredded wheat in the safeway brought us back into the twenty-first century. Dillon is apparently the home to yet another branch of the Montana university system—Western Montana State or something like that. I’ve long been amazed at the fortitude of Montana, which has only about 800,000 residents and which hosts an astonishing variety of institutions of higher education. It would be as if Portland decided to have a vast municipal university system, with universities of east porland and the city university of northeast portland, etc.    Jackson : Jackson feels like a colony of the international order of globalism in the Rocky Mountains. You can fly in and out of Jackson, if the idea of spending too much time in the rest of the West offends you. Everything’s very expensive and glossy. They support the arts magnificently. They’re building a performing arts center that will be the home to a vast array of Jackson-based artistic organizations. As I mentioned in another entry, you can get the Times without any surcharge at all there. I suspect that there are lots of openly gay people in Jackson.   Riverton : If Jackson felt ickily inauthentic, Riverton was ickily authentic Americana. Although it’s in an Indian reservation, the only Native Americans we saw were the cleaning people in our motel (another Super 8). The owners, inciudentally, were Indians from India. Riverton had no sickly sweet faux Western buildings, just big boxes—Walmarts and Super Ks. Their city hall was in a strip mall, not some ornate 19th-century building. Our motel was filled with hunters, I suspect. The whole place felt very Republican.   Rawling : We just passed through Rawlins looking for a gas station, but it was interesting to see its downtown, which is in terrible disrepair. Like other small towns in the West, it has lots of two-story brick buildings, but most of them are boarded up or in disrepair. The old movie theater is abandoned, for instance. The only commercial life in the city seems to be on the edges of twon, where we found our gas station/taco bell unit. (Not that we ate at the Taco Bell!)   Laramie : When I saw “The Laramie Project,” I was struck by the similarities between Walla Walla and Laramie—small towns in the West, homes to institutions of higher education, more progressive than their surroundings and than their reputations. Visiting the town, I could only confirm that impression. Like Walla Walla, Laramie is surrounded by wheat fields and rolling hills, but is within an hour or two of stunningly beautiful mountain areas. The town is quite lovely. They have a large downtown area consisting of late nineteenth-century brick buildings that have been renovated and are now the homes to art galleries, bookstores, restaurants (including vegetarian ones like “Sweet Melissa,” where we ate delicious food),  and cafes. One bookstore had the Times, for no surcharge. We were able to connect to the internet at a café. I think I could be quite happy in Laramie, actually. But would Matthew Shepherd’s fate hang over one’s head if one lived there? While driving into the town, we had to wonder if we were driving by the barbed wire fence where Matthew Shepherd was left to die.

      From a Starbuck's in St. Louis ...    Our Typical Travel Day  We wake around 8, which we feel is pretty respectable, especially because half of the time, we’ve just crossed into a new time zone, which means that 8 for everyone else is 7 o’clock. However, it apparently isn’t respectable enough, because it always seems that there are just a few stragglers left in the motel when we start stirring and we always seem to be the last people to leave the place. Again and again, we’ll arrive at a Motel 6 or a Super 8 at 10 or 11 at night, have a hard time finding parking because there are so many cars at the motel, and awaken to an empty parking lot, with our car parked a seemingly unnecessary quarter mile away.  We’ve decided that the reason is that most people are trying to get some place by some specific time, while we’re enjoying the trip for its own sake. It’s really a problem of American culture that travelers can’t stop to enjoy the view now and then. We don’t have this problem.   Anyway, we usually try to let the dog out and exercise a bit. We’ve brought some 20 lb weights and some grips that make it easier to be push-ups. I try to remember my yoga and pilates moves. Then we shower and pack., trying to clean out the car a little bit.  By this time, there’s usually not much left of the continental breakfast, so we grab some coffee and look for breakfast.  I used to love taking advantage of traveling as a great excuse to eat breakfasts in greasy diners. We’ve looked for greasy diners, but haven’t seen any that have lept out to us as worth it. In addition, we don’t like to leave Moritz baking in the car in the full sun, and we haven’t found many places that have shaded parking. In fact, it seems to be a fact of traveling in August that often there aren’t any shadows at all, which seems to defy the laws of physics and yet is what I observe.  So we’ve eaten out of grocery stores every day so far—in Lewiston, in Dillon, and today in Ogallala. It’s actually potentially much more healthy and inexpensive than the greasy diners. Today I went for a more German style breakfast, with cheese and rolls, plus a yogurt and some fruit. We consumed this in a park in Ogallala, which was quite charming. Not too hot either, as it was overcast and unseasonably cool.  If we haven’t just crossed into a new time zone, meaning that the local 8 is actually our 7, we usually have to cross into a new one, meaning that if we thought we were pushing off at 10, it will actually be an hour later in just a few miles. That’s what happened today. In Nebraska the time zone shifts between Ogallala and North Platte, so what should have been an hour’s drive looked like a two hour drive.  So around 10 or 11, we really begin our driving in earnest. We alternate driving every two hours or so. At this point, we’re generally up for anything, and we take scenic by-ways, stop at historical sights, and drive off the highway to see what the towns with interesting names look like.  Whenever we stop, we let Moritz out and run around a bit with him. He usually drinks some water. This trip, which I believe he is enjoying, has entirely disrupted his schedule.  It’s hard to predict when he’ll eat or go to the bathroom. We feed him our scraps all day long, of course, and he almost always eats those. But it’s a different story with his own food, even including the dog bisuqits, which he usually relishes. The closest thing to a pattern is that several evenings he has gotten up in the middle of the night and gone to eat his dog food.  The plan is usually to have a lunch sometime in the middle of the afternoon. Since we have generally been travelling on the byways, though, we often find ourselves in small towns that don’t have any obvious food choices. Unforunately, not every town can be a Dayton, with a Main Street lined with inviting delicious restaurants. And we’re trying to resist the fast food nation. So this all means that we’ve frequently ended up having an early dinner rather than a late lunch. We arrived in both Jackson and Laramie around 4 or 5 in the evening having only snacked since our late breakfast. Today, we did break down and get a pizza from a Pizza Hut in a boring town in northern Kansas.  Generally, this stop in the late afternoon or early evening has been in some attractive progressive place (Missoula, Jackson, Laramie) and we walk around a bit, checking out what the art cinema is showing and keeping our eyes open for a New York Times and an internet café. So this stop usually lasts a couple of hours.  Sometimes this early dinner has been our only other regular meal besides the grocery store breakfast. Yesterday, however, Ivan wanted us to have a third meal, late in the night, shortly before we stopped in Ogallala. And today we went to an Italian restaurant in Salina around 8.  We usually drive for a couple hours after it gets dark. That’s when I have been writing these entries.Usually we are desperately trying to reach some motel for which we have a now no-longer-refundable deposit. We have to make the reservations because we wante to be sure to get into places that accept dogs.  When we arrive in the hotel (between 10 and 11), Moritz generally goes in first and starts looking for a toilet out of which to drink. He’s become very adept at this, even managing to get his head in under the closed lid. We plug in all of our electornic devices in to replenish their batteries and transfer the photos from the digital camera to my computer. The TV usually goes on and I try to finish the Times.  We’re usually in bed around 12.      I don't want to go on at too much length, because Ivan needs to use the computer too ...

      It's quite a bit harder to blog while travelling than I imagined--so you'll have to wait for the polished version of the trip .... but here's something I wrote last night:    Riding through the Wind River Indian Reservation  It’s almost 10 at night, and we’re listening to a 7 CD compilation of music from the 70s. More about music and driving later. We’ve seen a lot of references to the Native Americans as we’ve travelled through this country. The Nez Perce seem to have been all over this inland Northwest area—we stopped at Chief Timothy bridge in eastern Washington, and he was a Nez Perce leader. The Lolo path was is a Nez Perce path, and it goes through large parts of the Nez Perce reservation. The Nez Perce seem to have put up a great deal of information about their history, sometimes in the same places as the monuments put up to Lewis and Clark. A day later we were in Eastern Idaho, near Yellowstone, and saw historical markers noting aspects of the Nez Perce Wars of the 1870s.  These markers reflect the varying norms of the times and cultures that put them up. On one marker—actually about the completion of the northern railroad—it was blandly noted that settlers on the west coast were anxious to have the railroad completed so that they could defend themselves better against “hostile natives.” Someone had crossed that phrase out, and replaced it with “indigenous peoples.”  I don’t know anything about this reservation, but will hopefully find out more tomorrow, as we arre planning on staying in Riverton, which is in the middle of the reservation. It looks fairly dry—sage bush plateau.   The countryside that we’ve left behind was just spectacular—a reason in itself for this trip, setting aside the move to New York. We started outside of Butte. We couldn’t find a diner with a shady parking space for Moritz, so we drove a ways before we gave up and found a Safeway and bougjht breakfast supplies which we ate on the parking lot. It’s actually pretty much just as good as breakfast in a diner, and probably healthier.   After our parking lot breakfast, we shot down toward Idaho Falls. It was kind of humiliating to return to Idaho on the third day of our trip (I mean it is just one state over, and we’re trying to cross the country!), but we wanted to skirt Yellowstone and approach the Grand Tetons from the West.   On the way, we ended up in the sand dunes of eastern Idaho. Seriously—they’re like sand dunes you’ld find in a desert. Moritz jumped out and ran around, but apparently decided it wasn’t that interesting, beaause he returned to the car and waited by the back door, happy to get back to his bed. We think the sand might have been too hot for his paws. But it was also of limited interest.   By this point we were off the Interstate. We headed toward the Grand Tetons from the east, through absolutely charming towns like “Tetonia.” Unfortunatley, there seems to be unlimited development in these towns, and they’re putting up track housing of various pricing categories in all the meadows and fields beneath the majestic mountains. We then went over the extraordinary Teton pass (over 9000 feet) and descended into Jackson.   Jackson was jam packed with tourists from all over the world. It sets the bar for all the little towns like Joseph that are trying to develop an economy based on tourism, art, and nature. There are blocks and blocks of faux Western buildings filled with western art, clothes, and tony restaurants.   Not suprisingly, there was also a bookstore that sold the New York Times there, so I got today’s. They didn’t even charge a surcharge (yesterday I paid $2 in Missoula, and in Walla Walla, we’re paying $1.25). And the cashier just called it “the Times,” not “the New York times.”  WE ate at “the Bunnery,” which was recommended in “Let’s Go.” They let us bring the dog to the patio.  Ivan and I both had buffalo burgers.  After Jackson, we decided to go north through Dubois to Riverton. We drove through the Grand Teton national forest, and then went East. Hard to do justice to how beautiful the countryside is. We ended up crossing anoher pass that was nearly 10,000 feet.      This is sent to you from "The Grounds" in downtown Laramie, Wyoming

      Written on the highway over Lolo Pass .... (no, I wasn't driving, silly!)   Our First Century  Our biker friends have been doing “centuries”—100 mile stints—all summer long, so we were thrilled to join the crowd. We made it a hundred miles on the first day of our cross-country trip, Monday, August 3. Well, more like 99. We drove from Walla Walla to Lewiston.  Well, yes, I suppose there is a difference  between doing a century in a car and doing it in a bicycle. And I suppose you might think that 100 miles is not very much for an automobile trip. But we didn’t get started until almost 5 in the afternoon, and we didn’t want to travel by night, especially in such beautiful country.  The plan was to leave at the crack of dawn—maybe go to Janet’s jazzercise class at 6 in the morning and then head off into the wild blue yonder. Actually even the plan was always already unrealistic, because we knew we had to drop off the cable equipment at an office that didn’t open until 8, and a computer I had borrowed from an office that didn’t open until 9. But the goal was to get out by mid-morning.   But you try clearing out all your personal effects from an office and a house that you’ve been in for four years! You try packing them all up and putting them in the basement! You try locating and packing all the items you’ll be needing for a year’s stay in Manhattan!   It takes longer than you’d think, or at least longer than I had thought. Part of the problem of course is that it’s hard to live in a house that you’re trying to empty. Eventually you run into a stubborn subset of things (dishes, cooking items, bedding, towels, toiletries, etc.) that you want to keep using until you leave, and you don’t know which of these to move first.  It didn’t help the workside of things that everyone was using our departure as an excuse to party like it was 1999. On the non-workside of things, of course, it was great that they wanted to do so. Thanks to Roberta, John K, John P, Roz, Hassan, Zahi, Nicole, Brad, Heidi, Susan, Julia, Jean, Janice, Rebecca, Lynn, Jeanne, Jackie, Melvin, Chad, Michael E, Al, Michael d, Gretchen, Midge, Pete, Laura, David, and everyone else who celebrated my getting out of town with me in the last week ...  But in any case, we did eventually get everything put away, the house pretty clean, and started taking care of the paperwork.We left Walla Walla between 4 and 5.  As we left, a rare summer storm poured down on Walla Walla.  An auspicious sign, I think.    This was posted from the  urlLink Raven  in Missoula. Very cool place, like Merchant's but with brighter colors and open in the evening.

      Guido Westerwelle, the leader of the liberal party in Germany (the Freie Demokratische Partei) has come out, according to the story mentioned below. It's been an open secret that Westerwelle was gay, and friends of mine have reported flirting with him at gay restaurants in Berlin. But he's never stated it publicly before.  His party, the FDP, is a socially liberal, pro-business party--liberal in that classic 19th-century sense. I think many progressive Americans would find it to be a comfortable home. But in Germany it is generally reviled by progressives, lefties, and academics. This is part because of its pro-business stands and its philosophical rejection of Marxism, which holds sway over many on the left. In addition, its pro-business attitudes have meant that it had a hard time cooperating with the unions who form the base of the social democratic party.   But the FDP also suffers from a perceived lack of character, because it is constantly coalescing with the majority party in order to get into power. It wanders back and forth between the SDP and the conservative Christian Democrats.   Since the emergence of the Greens, the SPD now has a logical coalition partner, so the FDP has coalesced more consistently with the conservatives. But the Greens are also a kind of liberal party in that 19th-century bourgeois sense, in my opinion, so it's interesting seeing the FDP and the Greens fight it out for what I suspect are many of the same voters.    urlLink Yahoo!
