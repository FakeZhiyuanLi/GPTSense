      Hi, peps! I have been fascinated about how English is spoken by different people in the world today. After reading the article "English as she is goodly spoken", I find it very funny and interesting to read that I want it to share to all of you! Wanna know why? Read and find out below:   "English as she is goodly spoken" adapted from Niño Bello & other sources  People could die laughing as they travel from one end of the globe to the other and observe how English is spoken or written:  In London itself: 	A hospital sign states: Visitors. Two to a Bed and Half-an-Hour Only. 	A café boasts: Our Establishment Serves Tea in Bag Like Mother. In Spain: 	 A toy fair had this description of what happens when you toss a doll in the air: Laughs while you throw up. In a Swiss mountain inn: 	Special today- no ice cream. In a Kansai international dormitory: 	 An invitation to a picnic stated: Join! You will meet strange people! 	A notice said: Do not bring the newspapers to your room. It might disturb other residents. From a Soviet weekly: 	There will be a Moscow exhibition of arts by 15,000 Soviet republic painters and sculptors. They were executed over  the last two years. From a Japanese instruction booklet: 	The instructions about using a hotel air conditioner state: Cools and heats: If you want just condition of warm in your room, please control yourself. In an Athens hotel: 	Visitors are expected to complain at the office between the hours of 9 and 11 a.m. daily. -0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-As what you've read, English is really spoken different and written in those old days. And  it is changing. During our English class few days ago, I can remember our lesson about "Phonetic Inconsistencies" wherein we are to pronounce unfamiliar words like: *Gaol- I can hardly pronounce this as /ga-ol/ it is spelled in British but it is pronounced in American as Jail. Also the word -draught-. With the wrong pronunciation, we pronounce it as /draught/. Again,  British spelling but pronounced in American as draft. For me, its really hard to pronounce those words, which we are not so familiar to pronounce with. I forgot to tell something, about how English as she is goodly spoken here in my country. About teachers telling their students to broom the floor instead to scrub, about politicians misusing the words fuchsia, chrysanthemum, fencing, and ambience, of movie stars talking about their wall-to-wall carpeting ("No, floor-to-floor lang naman.") or of beauty queens who won in contests because they "have long legged". Yah!, all of this really sounds so funny about how my co-Filipinos speak English.
