      Yea... I had a pretty boring day. I mean, I was up late talkin to some people on line, went to bed around 5. I woke up at 1:01 and then I went online. I have nothing else to do with my life (lol). But tonite Melly is sleeping over, and as I told Mike Ryan (Penis to his friends) we are going to have mad wild lezbian sex. But if we are too filled up on pizza then we are going to rent a few movies. It'll be fun.

      Hey all... every one has these post things lately and I thought I'd go ahead and get one too cause, hey, it seems the "it" thing right now (heehee). Anyways, I am Lauren, I am 16 from Staten Island, New York, and this is my blog. Get ready for an interesting read, cause I mean, its my life, and reading about other peoples lives (especailly lives with all the things that mine has) is fun! Well, right now I guess nothing too interesting has happend. I just went outside to get the mail and there was none. Now wasn't that just riveting? Tonight I'm taking my friend Melanie (Melly) out for her birthday (HAPPY BIRTHDAY MELLY!) with her boyfriend (Greg), my boyfriend (also a Greg) and our firend Gerard and his girl Jen. Should be a good do I reckon (sorry too much Harry Potter). More on how that goes later! Right now I'm going to figure out how to work this blog thingy so talk to you later! Peace xox

      Okay this post is an aopolgy to Greg who I really offended. He was being very good about me going to Feas house tomrrow and he told me to have a good time and I said "You say that but you really want me to have a bad time so when I tell you, you can be like 'See you should have spent the day w/ me'" which was TOTALLY out of line. Greg I am so sorry. I love you, please don't be mad at me.

      Hey there everyone! I'm back from Florida!!!! I have had the best time EVER!! It has deffinitly been ranked in the top 5 of vacations I have taken. Well the first day there was really boring. Just me and my mom shopping. I got a really nice bathing suit there though. Then the second day Derrick and his family came. I met him there last year so at least knew each other. We hung out that day making more friends. Me, him, his brother and sister all hung out with the other people there. By the like thrid day of vactaion we had a huge posse of people. It was so great! They were all so... just... awesome. I mean  I knew these people for one week and it felt like I knew them my whole life! I would take a bullet for any of these people. James and Shawn were from Canada. James does the BEST immitation of Dr. Evil I have EVER heard in my whole life. He could take over for Mike Myers. Elliot is from England. He was really cute, he had the cutest accent (Fuckkin wanka!). I met him at casino night at the hotel. Then there was the Matt from Conetticut. He was really cool. He's like 7 feet tall and he was just hysterical. Then Jose who is just like the best (you wuddnt have had to drug me man). Then Sara (shes also British)who is my girl. You guys I picked out the BEST outfit for her when we went out. She looked sooooooooo nice all the boys were like shhaawwinnngggg!!! (lol) Then there was Matt and Patrick. They are aslo from England and they knew each other. Matt is a sick soccer (oops, I mean FOOTBALL) player and he yelled at me for sayin Nokia wrong and for saying "cell" instead of "mobile"... cheers big ears. And just because you beat me at air hockey like everyone esle dont make you better then me! Patrick was sooooo funny. He's 11 and knows WAYYYY too much for his age. Nuff said. And then there was John. My track and kemp buddy! And how could I forget Anthony!?!?!?! us New Yorkers gotta stick together!! Your ass just got New Yorked biotch!!!! And Tisha, the crazy Texan!! Girl if you EVER need me just gimmie a call alright???  I will NEVER forget these people. When I was leaving everyone was so sad!! I have never had people do that for me before. I don't think anyone I met over vacation has ever cried over me leaving before. I love you guys!!!!!!! I think the best night we all had, well there were 2. The night was almost all fought those kids for bein dicks wasnt excactly FUN but thank God for swings (lol Matt). Then the night we went to Pleasure Island! Oh man Freddie vs. Jason was a sick movie. And Matt I don't care what you say, you still owe me dinner. James you were mad funny that night ("Yea no doubt!" as the whole theater cracks up). Like I said, I don't think I have ever felt so close to people I met on vacation as I have this trip. James and Shawn I'm deff comming up to Canadia to see yous. Sara, Elliot, and Matt I'll be comming to England soon you can count on it. Jose, Ant, Matt, D, Tay, and Cory yous are so close I can deff go and see you and visa versa. Tish, you always have a room in my house if you need it girl and give me a call if you need to alright??? OMG but you's have NO idea how sad me leaving was. Like, my mom called to see if the plane was delayed or anything and the lady said that it was delayed till 11 0r 12. So I'm extatic cause it means we get to stay a litte longer but then the lady tells my mom it would be best to be there anyways just in case so things sucked again. So, my mom told me to say goodbye just in case we cant come back. It was TERIBLE. I was crying like you would not believe and so were some of the others. I felt like I was on my death bed and they were all mourning me or something. Then we got to the airport and they said the flight wasnt unitll 11:30 so my mom told me we could go back. I was SOOOO happy. I called Jose and told him but he was at dinner so he couldn't spread the word yet. We got back to the hotel and I ran around everywhere looking for people and then I ran into the pool room and saw Shawn I ran to him and then Elliot and James saw what was going on and there were hugs all around. I told them what was up and then I got a call from Matt (the british one, the other Matt left that morning) I told him where I was and him and Patrick came and we all hung out. We got in touch with Sara and then Jose came and it was like all of us together again! It was great!!! I had only left for 30 minutes but it felt like years ya know? Our second goodbye was bad, but not as bad ya know? I mean, I was sad deff but it felt as though we were leaving on much better terms then how we had before. Like, the one before was rushed and just like bad. But this one was a little easier.  Well, thats enough for today, it's long enough. Talk to you all later!!! xoxoxoxox

      The only difference is I know when I'll be back again. I'm leaving for Florida tomorrow... well today... hey in 5 hours! I am so scared to get on that plane... you guys have NO idea. I might just take 1 or 3 Nyquill gell caps or something. I just wanna knock myself out cause I really don't want to fly. I hate it so much. Well... pray for me. Last time I was on a plane I cried hystericaly cause it kept on dipping. If you hear that a plane crashed tomorrow, I am leaving from Newark I think at 7a.m. to Orlando, Florida. Well... I love you all. Peace xoxox

      Well today was a bit better. My mom went on another rant about how things suck and I just listened to my Harry Potter book 5 audio book. It's so much funner and easier to listen to that book. It's deffinitly not my favorite. I think my favorite is book 4, then book 3, then 1 then 2 then 5. Yea, that sounds good. But, this book has some good parts. Right now the narrator is up to the part where Harry and Cho go into Hogsmead on Valentines Day. Who invited her into book five anyways? I'm a Harry/ Ginny shipper personally. Today was okay though. I put up chapter four on my web site (www.geocities.com/lauren_deb/). I think it's pretty good. My Sorting Hat song is pretty good, needs a little tweaking but oh well. HEY! Speak of Tweak, IM MISSING SOUTH PARK! Oh well, I'll catch the rerun a little later.  Any ways, Greg came over for a little bit today. We hung out on my porch and talked about how messed up our families are and his breath was terrible (lol just kidding!).  Well, that's about it for now. I'll talk to you tomrrow. (Florida on Saturday!) XOXOXOX

      Well, today was a total waste of oxygen... long story short, my famly fued flaired up again. I went to dinner with my cousin James tonight. When I came home I told my mom what was said and she blew up as expected. Guys, all I can say is I'm about one minute away from running away from this house. I can't be here any more, it feels like the cheery blue walls of my room are closing in. I don't wanna be alone. I want someone to just pop in here and hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay. I hate all this fighting. I hate this yelling. Why can't we all just be happy? When I have a family none of this shit is gonna go down. None of it. I won't tolerate it. I was just checkin how I would get out my window. The brick is a little too thin but I think I could make it. I told Greg to keep an eye out for me till 1:30. Things are dying down though so I might be able to make it through the night. Damn. XOXOX

      Hey all... well, today was okay I guess. Kind of depressing really. My step mom Sheila, has a friend who just had triplets and today we went to visit them. There is one girl  and two boys: Emma, Matthew, and Sean. They are so cute! Emma was bigger the the boys and she wuddnt stop sleeping, reguardless of her mothers telling her too (remindes me of me). Then the two boys were okay. Matthew was cute, he just sat there and watche TV in his little swing, but Sean, Jesus Christ the boy would no stop crying. But, when he was really bad, I felt really bad for him so I picked him up, and I don't know, did some instinctal thing and he stopped crying. It was like so cute... but I felt terrible for him cause they think he might be autistic. He did seem to have a very short attention span but, I felt terrible. This poor little baby, who should have such a long healthy life ahead of him, might not. Ya know? Any way, I need to cheer up. Peace xox

      Yea, I'm bored again (lol). Last night was terrible. I took my dads laptop into my room and there were only 2 DVD's worth watching: Ice Age and Snow Dogs. My luck, Ice Age didn't work for some odd reason, so I ended up watching Snow Dogs. I feel asleep during the second showing of it and I woke up at one. My dad took me out driving thow so that was cool. I got a little nervous though cause someone was behind me and I dunno, I felt like "AH!". But, I did good, he let me park and everything (lol). I went into East Hampton too, I got Mariana and Claire something for thier birthdays. Ha ha I'm not saying what they waye just in case they read this. I feel oh-so smart hee hee. Any way, we have dinner reservations at this place called The Laundry, hope its not too DRY... ha ha get it... Laundry, dry-cleaning... okay yea I know bad joke. Talk to you later!

      Hey all... yea I am really bored right now. There is just nothing to do here ya know? I was just thinking (ouch!), what happened to *Nsync? Remember them? I do anyone who has been in my room knows how big a fan I was. Well, I just put in "Celebrity" cause it is one of my favorite CD's, and I said to myself, "Self, I wonder if all the *Nsync sites you used to go to are still up?" So, me, myself, and I went to a bunch of my old faves. Most of them have turned into an *Nsync/ Justin Timberlake site. Like Nsyncstudio.com for instance. Nsync.com says that they are working on a new site, which probably means that they are going to be underconstruction for a long time, I mean, *Nsync isn't really top news any more is it? (sob) Good times.. good times. I mean you know your getting older when you take all your old posters off the walls. Anyway, I only came on really to see if Greg or Debra or Mickey or someone was online to talk to and since no one seems to be, I'm going to go to bed and get some beauty sleep. Night! XOX

      Hey all. Today, I... well I didn't wake up because I didn't sleep (lol). I went to the mall and almost had a nervous breakdown. I think every mother with a child who loves to scream was following me into every store I went into today. The thing about that that really gets to me is that everyone around the baby is like "Aw, hes so cute!" and "Aw, he's a big boy!" and "He's a wild little one!" as the kid is screaming his head off, and there I am in the dressing room almost crying beause the headache from lack of sleep and the headache from the screaming kids were meshing and forming one big throbbing pain in my head. In the end, I got my outfit in the first store I went to (this is after I went to 5 other stores just to make sure I didn't find anything there). Then, I came home, took a small nap, and when I got up from my nap I got ready to go to Melissa's sweet 16. It was really fun!! I hadda good time. I felt kinda bad for Greg though because his foot was hurting him and like he really didn't have anyone to talk to if I went to dance. But he talked to Morgan and Kim and I think he had a fun time. Melissa looked REALLY puuurrrty (lol). And, as of 12:00 A.M. it is Greg and my five month anniversery! Well, thats about it. I have to go pack for the Hamptons now cause my dad is comming to pick me up early in the morning. Peace xoxox

We has so much fun and talked about everythng. And, yea, Melly, Tom looked hot. We talked about like everything, like, carnival games that involve hammers for instance (lol). Then, I went to track. It was okay I guess. Then I got home and Greg came over around 8. We had fun. Watched South Park. It was the one where Stan, Kyle, and Cartman's parents send them to Kenny's house to get the chicken poks (sp?). Then we hung out and chilled and he left at 11:30. Now, I'm mad bored, not tired, and talkin to Mickey cause he's cool and he's up. Hee hee. Tomorrow, I need to go and get an outfit for Melissa's sweet 16. Can't wait for that cause I havent seen her or anyone else really all summer! Okay, I'm out, peace xox

      I'm not gonna taint this post with my stupid petty teenage problems... I just wanna let out a lil prayer that God bless all those who died on Septeber 11, 2001 and their families... I had time to think this morning and I can't stress enough to all you reading (which is only about 3 people) the importance of life... just living life day to day and not worrying about what's going to happen next week or next year... just living for the now cause for all we know next year or even next week might never come... September 11th was two years ago and that's kind of hard to believe.. it feels like it was only yesterday... I can remember everything so clearly... I'm sure we all can... So, I'm going to stop rambling and just end with this: live your life to the fullest... live every day as if it was your last... don't worry about the little things cause they will be sorted out in the long run... with everything else going on in this world, I don't think that where we are going or what we are doing saturday night matters all too much... just live ya life and be happy while we have the time... and that's all I got to say about that! "... I really do want world peace" XOXOXOXOXOX

Greg is such a dick... he found out about Vin and now we're just not talking any more.. not like it matters... all we ever did was fight any ways.... but see, he didn't take it too well... again: not that it matters. He has no right to tell me what to do anymore. He was just being a totaly baby about it... when we broke up all the other times and I found he was hooking up with other girls I let it be... I didn't IM him and start fights. I just wanted me and him to be friends like we always were when there wasn't any room for convo's about how much he misses me and how I was so bad to him and then me yelling back about how he mad me that way. I miss when me and him could just talk on the phone about nothign.. but I don't even want that after tonight... I don't... So I blocked him cause I didn't want to deal with him anymore. We'll talk again eventaually but I don't know when that will be. I'm just mad nervuos hes going to try and do something to Vin... I'd rather me get beat up, as Claire had threatend, then him. He hasn't done anything... Greg is just so fucking messed up... SO messed up... the only thing that's really comforting me right now is my Dashboard CD (many a thanks to Deb) and the thought that theres only 2 more years left till I get to leave this place... 2 more years and I'll get to leave him (Greg) behind... I know I just said that we'll talk eventually but... I don't know tonights fight was pretty intense... if we stop being friends then I guess I would be able to deal with it but... I don't know I don't like people hating me cause I'm trying to make myself happy... everyone always says I think of other people too much and focus less on myself... and that's all I'm doing, thinking about myself for once.. I could have EASILY said yes to going back with Greg out of pitty for him but I wasn't going to do that for a few reasons, 1. I don't want a boyfriend and 2. that's mean and disrespectful and would have resulted in a worse breakup later.... this whole summer has been filled with ups and downs and I can't wait for school to start when things will get easier and I won't have all this free space in my head to think about stupid things... I just wanna have fun... be happy.. and I have been lately up until tonight... I just need for tomrrow to come when I see my friends I guess... yea... alright.. I'll see you all tomorrow... much love XOXOXOXOXOXOXOX

      Hey guys I'm just bored so I thought I'd type a little bit before I gotta get ready to go out. Things just don't feel right lately. I don't know why... I know it's not Greg... I think it's my friends. I don't feel as close with them as I'd like to, you know? Like they all talk on the phone for hours and then there's me who might have a five minute convo with them online. I don't know... I guess before, when I was always with greg they all had the chance to hang out and get close and stuff. It just feels like, if they had a problem they wouldn't come to me, like they would feel weird talking to me or wouldn't want me to know things. I don't know, it's probably just my own paranoya (sp?) or something. Maybe now I'll have more time to spend with them and stuff. I hope so... oh well... I'll talk to you after Ashley's peace XOXOX

      Nothing really too interesting about yesterday. It's like 2 a.m. so I'm just going to talk about yesterday as if it were today cause I'm bored and there will be more to talk about what happens today later. Well today (yesterday) was boring.. very very boring... I stayed home, chilled and went to track. I had a really bad time at it cause my heart just wansn't in it for some reason. I hadda sick pain in my side and I just didn't wanna do it. Then I came home, and well, I don't know this whole breaking up with Greg business is becomming very.. annoying. I just want it delt with and over but I mean some people just don't wanna forget it and wanna keep bothering me about it. I just want to be me, you know? I want to be able to do my own thing with out him feeling bad cause I mean I'm not a heartless bitch like most people think I am now, I'm just pissed off. Aren't I allowed to be unhappy? Are my feelings so wrong?? Why should I have to make myself miserable, just to make someone else happy, when in the long run they would be miserable cause I was miserable?? That would just make us both miserable, wouldn't it? Of course it would. That's why I don't understand why people just won't let it be and get over it. Like, I don't like that I hurt him but I had to think of myself a little here. I mean, it was always about him, about what he wanted and what he needed. All of our relationships were about what he wanted to do and how he wanted it to go, well this time I had to do something. When he did it, when he tried to break up with me I said to him "If that's what you wanna do." and I let him go, I didn't want to, but I did because it was what he wanted, and now, because I want to do something on MY terms for once, I'm a cold hearted bitch who loves to stomp on people till the die. It just doesn't make sense. Thank God for my friends especailly Debra, Erica, Melanie, Mariana and Mick who have their own problems who took time out of their lives to delv into mine and help me, they still are. Just thank God for them, I just don't know what I'd do. The rest of the trackies too, I was so blessed to be givin such good friends that I could always turn too and that will always be there for me. Especailly now with... well.. one thing and another, they know what I'm talkin about... they are just there for me and I want them to know that I love them so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o much and I will always be there for them if they EVER need me in a heartbeat... I'd do anything for yous just always know that alright?? Alright... well that's enough for tonight (today)... I'll give you a run down of Ashley's sweet 16 which is later today (today)... peace much love XoXoXoXoXo

      Well, it's that time again. We had to go into school today for our programs. I have the WORST schedule in the world. And my lunch is like... Guam time or something... but its okay, Melissa, Morgan, Simione, and Stasi are there so its all good. I'm in a few classes with people too, Alex is in a bunch and so is Stasi. Also, Melissa and Danielle are in my homeroom so yay! lol... So after orientation we (Me, Mariana, Debra, Danielle, Marina, Erica, Stasi, Simione, John, and Dave) went to Andrews Diner, Dave picked us up. It was fun, I had a BLT club and it was huge! Then, I came home, went to track, and then came home and got ready for everyone tocome over. It was mad fun. We watched John's tapes of him lighting fireworks and peeing, and taking a shit... it was.... well it was different... entertaining but different. Then, we played truth or dare... and we'll just fast forward here... After that we watched the "Shrek in the Swamp Kariokie Dance Party" and then we switched the movie to "Mouse Hunt"... good times good times... I think the jr. boys are like so awesome. They are just all like so funny and so cool and you can't hang out with them without something funny happening... they are just.. awesome I dunno. But... yea... tomorrow will be.. well it will be tomrrow lol... I don't have anything to do really so we'll see where things go. Deb and I are supposed to go to the city w/ Vallillo and some people so... we'll see. Alrite that's it... much love XOXOXO

      I stayed home from school today. Last night was pretty bad. I just totally broke down.. just like totally fell apart. I hate taking to Greg. When eva I do something happens and I just get so upset. He just makes me feel like shit and I can't stand talkin to him. And I don't know some of the stuff we had talked about was really bothering me and I didn't feel like dealing with anyone today. I just wanted to have a day to myself. Everything is just piling up and I can't take it any more. Like, if I was allowed to make my perfect world I would include Erica, Debra, Melanie, the trackies, everyone from Florida, Mick, and a few adults I think are cool and that would be it. And we would live somewhere it's warm and we would just have a great time. No worries, just kids bein kids and havin a good time. I just been thinking about like everything lately and I've come to the conclusion that my life, while its not shit, has a lot of speed bumps. And last night was just a really big one... I'm glad I stayed home today and had time to think. I'm gonna get ova last night. I'm gonna get my self together, and I'm gonna handle this.

ANYONE tell me why this man would even THINK about leaving??? why?? whats the perpose??? they are just so gay.. how can someone just WALK OUT on their family like that??? HOW??? does family mean anything to ANYONE anymore??? i mean, look at my family.. the thing between my mom and aunt is still in full swing, there haven't been any recent developments but i mean, still.. youd think they would have GROWN UP by now... but NO... people need to stop being so god damn fucking gay and start taking responsibility for their lives and their families and the problems they cause... if there is a problem you dont just walk away from it... especially if its a family... you stay and you solve it you gay ass mother fucker!!! and another thing, what is up with this whole "dying" thing... I mean really... why does God have to be gay like that??? don't he know that these people have people that love and need them??? what are you doin up thea man, don't you see the trouble you cause??? i mean, charolet is a good woman and has a family that loves her.. which comes back to the family thing.. char, we told you to cut down on the smokin... we TOLD you so MANY times... not that I'm blamin it on you... but... oh who am I talkin to she won't be reading this...okay, I'm done venting.. time to listen to relaxing music to calm me down.. x0x

      **if you couldn't tell I'm very bored**  10.  Running... I mean really, what track team runs? 9.  Practice... who ever said "practice makes perfect" obviously has never run in the rain with a white shirt on 8.  Knees/ Legs... really, who needs um? 7.  People... they just all suck, well all except the trackies and a few others 6. North Faces... Hence the phrase "welcome to Staten Island, where everyone has a North Face and a drama case" 5. Emotions... all they do it take you over and get you lost in sorrow, now if I had to be lost anywhere sorrow would not be the number one place on  that  list 4. The Mall... where all the gang-stars chillax and occasionally shop 3. Boyfriends... okay, here's the thing on boyfriends, things always start out peachy-keen (jelly bean) and then as time goes, things just go downhill, whether both people feel it or just one and then someone's gotta be hurt and things get all fucked up for a while 2. Boys (in general)... they aren't good for much, well, some of them... I think that if you have at least a few good guy friends that's all good but I mean, most boys, all they do is cause you stress that you really don't need  And the number 1 thing that is over rated  LOVE... no explanation necessary   thanks to deb who reminded me of some

      Okay, Mick called me at like 1:30 last night and told me that all was good and that hes all set to come so life is VERY good. I have that silly open house at my school today. I'm gonna be with coach in the gym so I can tell people how fun the track team is and how much fun and how much hard work goes into running. What a way to spend my Sunday. But yea that whole "turning back the clocks" thing totally messed me up cause like... I woke up at 7 this morning and its like... it would really be 8, so in reality I woke up at 8 but the clock said 7... so can you see why I'm messed up. Like, for this post, it'll say around 10:15ish... but like, really, if it was yesteday or Friday it would say 11:15ish.... stop the maddness!!!

      Yea. I am really bored. My Saturday night was kinda relaxing. I stayed home with my mom and we watched "Down With Love" and anyone who's seen "Down With Love" knows that it has plenty of sexual inuendos and like my mom was "astonished" that her little girl knew what they were talking about. It was kinda funny. Then I talked to Urcinoli and now I'm watching "Panic Room" for about that 100th time. But oh well, it's the only good thing on HBO. So yea, I downloaded this song called "This Will Be", it's the one where its like "This will be, an ever lasting love..." and I was listening to it and it sounded like a pretty good wedding song. Like, when I get married I don't want a slow "I love you, your beautiful" song, those are so old. I want something thats upbeat and perky! Ya know? Like, I don't want it to be slow. Cause I mean, I dunno I just don't. I think thats a really good one. I'll have to keep it in mind for that day lol. Wow, how sad I'm not even 17 yet and I'm planning my wedding lol. Well I think every girl does that. I mean, it's like one of the biggest days in a girls life, and I guess a guys too but I don't know how many guys sit there and think about their tux ya no? So yea, I'm bored.... very bored.... hummm, what's on my mind that I could talk about.......... OH! I saw Brian, from Notre Dame track camp, the one from Fordham at the meet today, he hurt his toe but I talked to him for a bit.... I offerd him and some of his teammates munchkins but they never came to get any.... oh well tuff for them... I bought a big bucket of munchkins for the team today, and we got Trish some ice cream cause it was her birthday today. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TRISH!!!! Okay, yea.. that's enough. For anyone who read this, hats off to you! x0x

      Now I know I must have spelt "metal" wrong but oh well. BUT I GOT ONE!! Wait, no I got 2! Cause, one was for the race and the other was a team metal cause we got second place (out of 5 teams but THATS NOT IMPORTANT!!!) My time sucked though. I did 19:24... VERY off my PR but oh well. Yea, I think I'm gonna hang around the house tonight. I don't feel much like going out, just relax maybe force my mom to take me to Blockbuster so I can rent "Down With Love" or something. Plus, I'm kinda worried cause Mick goin to Notre Dame on Saturday all depends on his party tonight. If it gets outta hand hes not allowed to go so... he's gonna call me lata when he gets the word. But if he does go hes gonna be in the same Hotel as me!! How cool? I think very!! Okay, I'm gonna go watch some TV, maybe rent a movie. Much love x0x0x0x

      Okay.. wow.. today was okay but Drivers Ed was KILLER. Like, in a Deb and I almost killed people kinda way. Deb almost hit a lady when she was turning and when I had pulled into the school, like, I thought the gas was the break and yea you figure out the rest... Thank God the instructor had his foot on the break or else like 5 people wudda died. Yea so that was my day. I'm gonna stay in tonight. I don't have much a choice my mom just got home and said my room is a mess and I have to stay home and fix it. Stoopid Monkey. Track tomorrow. Pray I do well. And pray that Mickey's party goes well cause he just told me that if anything like bad happens then his moms not gonna let him come to the ND game or Chicago on Friday night. I think I would cry.. like... really bad.

      Okay, just a quick random thought: I cannot wait till next week!!! Only 10 days!! That's like.. both my hands!!!! Me n Mick have been talkin now for ::counts on fingers:: 3 months online and stuff and now I'm gonna get to see him for the first time since Notre Dame!!! He knows the hotel I'm stayin at and it was featured on "Great Hotels" (Great Show!) on the Travel channel so like, yea Samantha Brown I'm stayin there too!! LOL So yea, we are makin plans to meet up Friday night and then Saturday we are gonna walk around campus and stuff like that.. then the game, which will HOPEFULLY be an upset but I'm not really counting on it. It's okay though. Next season. Okay, I'm out. Grassy-ass for listening to this pointless banter (lol I MISS YOU CANADIANS!!!).

      Wow... this was one of the most single hardest tests I've ever taken. Okay, guys, on part 4, I musta only answered half the questions. I was so mad though cause I think it was number 37, I had the answer, just one more calculation and I would have had it... and Mrs. Erardi goes "Put your pencils down." I almost cried. So yea... the test was bad. I mighta scraped a 900 but I doubt it. Greg said I could kick him in the balls if I didn't get a 1000 so I think he better go buy a cup cause I'll be breakin out the big boots. Yea... then I came home and slept and then at ten to 4 I dragged my ass to CCD. I had half a mind to call in and be like yea I'm not comming but I went anyways. I just finished grading their tests they took today. Highest grade was an 88 and lowest was a... 24 I think. Don't remember and don't feel like going into the folder and looking. Okay, that's it. Gonna talk to Mickey for a little while. Peace x0x

      WOW okay Brown this year was a blast!!! I had a great time and I think everyone else did too. The busride up was a great time (we read about finding your G-spot) and then when we go to the park we went for a little test run on the course. Then we played around at the park for a while. We did like a sequence on my video camera where all the girls were like doin carwheels and stuff, then me and Duff had a mock fight. James somewhat molested Carolin on camera when she was talkin, we took pictures of all of us by the big sign thing. Then we went to the hotel and got ready to go out to dinner and the arcade. I went on the go-karts with everyone and a bunch of people we didn't know. I beat everyone except this one kid but I past all the rest. Then a bunch of us went on this like "Haunted" walk through thing. It was only scary cause like people jumped out at you and stuff and I almost broke Vin's hand. Sorry about that. lol. So, then Deb and I whipped Vin at this driving game. Oh yea, and our room had no electricity so we were like in the dark and had to use other peoples like hair dryers and stuff. So when we got  back to our rooms we had like a little meeting with coach and we tried to get our room switched but there werent any extras so we hadda stick it out. It was okay though. We hung out and ate ice cause we had nothing to drink and we ate a little candy. We plugged the radio into the bathroom cause that was the only part of the room that had power and then like, just as we were fallin asleep there was a little pop and the lights came on. It was so scary I like jumped a foot in the air lol. So, then the next day, we woke up (dah) and then we ate a little breakfast, read the newspaper (lol) and hopped on the bus to the park. Kersha is very comfy when your heads not on his noisy stomach (lol). So, then, we got to the park and set up the tent. The frehsman girls went off first, then the Jv, and then the Varsity. I PRd!! I think almost everyone did. I ran 22:40 I think, somewhere in that area. So then the rest of the day we played around. A bunch of us did the electric slide (I got it on tape) and then I listend to some of the Notre Dame game, but turned it off and then I found out later they lost 42-14. Very very very not cool. BC next week so... I should start praying now. So, then we had the busride home which was barrels of laughs. I slept, or tired to sleep through most of it, then we were home and then that was it. Brown 2003 was over (breaks into hystercal crying fit). It was so much fun. I love our team. Everyone is just so like, awesome. All of them. Like, in our room, we were talkin about how great everyone is, and like we were naming the best outta them and we named like everyone. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!! Okay, thats enough emotional stuff. Now, to Homework. BLAH!!! x0x

      Yay! The time we have all been waiting for has finally arrived! Brown time!!!! Well, it hasn't been that egerly anticipated as that. But tomrrow we leave for Brown and I don't know I'm looking forward to it and then I'm not.. ya know? I don't want it to be like last year when we all just wanted to kill each other. I want to have fun this year guys!! We must have fun!!! So... yea.. I'm talking to Mick and I'm really depressing myself. I had a hard time today at PSAT class and... like.. I started to cry towards the end of the class cause I just DID NOT get the math. I hate it.. and it hates me. I'm not gonna get into Notre Dame you guys. I'm just not. I'm gonna try of course, but... I know what their answer will be already. I just wish I was good at something. Like, track, I'm okay at... not really good. I wanna be really good at something. I wanna be able to be like "BAM look at what I'm good at!" I wanna go to Notre Dame. That's the reason I do all the stupid clubs I do. I want it so bad, and even though people say "If you want it bad enough you'll get it." this does not apply here. It doesn't. I want Notre Dame so bad, I would give up just about anything for the chance to go there... but... enough of this pointless crying and worrying. I'll just need to get myself together by Tuesday when I take the PSAT's. Chances of getting a 900... slim to none. I'll report on Brown Saturday night. Much love. x0x

      Well this weekend was pretty fun filled actaully. Friday, I went to Dock Street, Saturday, I had my race which was pretty good. I missed my PR by like litteraly one second. But it was okay the whole time there was fun. We had like a long time before our race so we were chillin. Matt brought a football so me, Deb, Erica, Danielle, Neil and Matt had a little football game. No mercy baby. That night, which like, made my week, NOTRE DAME WON!!!!!! THEY WON, THEY WON, THEY WON!!! Then, me, Erica, Melanie and Debra went into Annadale and met up with Mariana and Danielle in Angelo's for some pizza. Then, Mariana left, and Danielle came with the rest of us to my house and we watched "Down With Love" and all of us were so ready to just grab a guy and just like... go at it... till next Tuesday... no, make that Friday... yea... Friday sounds good. Then we watched some of Pirates of the Carribean... which hightened the crave even more. Melanie was feeling the most.. um... chocolte-worthy LMAOOOO.. sorry Mel, hadda say it. So, then when everyone left, I watched Holes, it was kinda cute... then, I woke up at 7 am on a SUNDAY and dragged my ass to Bay Street to help hand out water at that half marathon.

      Today was alrite till track happened. Mariana said something to me today and after she said it I could understand her point of view, but the reason  I had such a problem with it was the way she said it. She was just so bitchy about it all.. if she had just like said what she said in a I don't know, like, nicer way, the whole thing could have been talked out. But oh well. Yea, but I had like the whole long conversation and I had told him we should hang out but, I don't think I will be doing that right now. I think I am going to go to my dads. Don't know though. Blah... theres a dress down on Friday. I don't know, should I do it? Blah... I'll think about it. Yea...

      WOW this week was soooo long. Thank God it's Friday. Tonight I'm gonna go over Stasi's w/ Deb, Jenn, I think Fea, Simione and Rubin. Should be fun. John's not commin though cause he don't like Stasi lol. So.. oh yea.. I just had like a 30 minute converstaion with a telemarketer. It was kinda funny actaully. He said he wanted to talk to me about switching Verison for long distance phone calls and I said "I'm not the bill payer of the house." and he goes "Oh, are you the daughter?" and I said "That would be me." and he said "Oh, how old are you?" and I said "16." and then hes like "Oh, well I'm 18 so don't think your talking to an old man." I'm like "Okay." so then he asked me if I had a boyfriend I could call long distance to and I'm like nah. And we started to talk about who casues more trouble: boys or girls. Then he asked me my nationality and asked how Staten Island was (I guess next to my number it says that or something) and I'm like "Cold. It's really cold outside." and hes like "Oh really? Im in Alberquirkie (sp?), New Mexico." and so I asked "Hows the weather there?" and hes like "It's nice, it rained this morning though." and I'm like "Well as long as it's sunny now!" and then he told me that hes from Long Island origonally. And then I don't know he asked me if I had an e-mial address and I said yes, but he didn't ask for it. And then he said "Okay, I'm sure you dont want to say on the phone with me." and I go, "Nah, I don't have anything else to do" so we talked for a little while longer and then that was it and he said he would call back later and the phone just rang five minutes ago but I didn't get to it in time. Oh well lol... okay, I'll post when I get back from Vins! Peace x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x

      Today was actaully good compared to shitty yesterday. My whole week was basicly shit cuzza stoopid teenage hormones and stoopid girlie things but they stopped so Thursday was pretty good. I had an okay day considering I failed my spanish test. But.. track was good too. I hadda good laugh actually when I found out about something that went down on Friday. A RELE good laugh. But... yea now I'm talkin to Mickey about Notre Dame. OH YEA!! I didn't get a chance to tell you, my dad got the ND vs. FSU tickets!!!!! I can't wait! And what's gunna make it 10x betta? Mick is gunna be there!!!! I can't wait to see him you have no idea. Like we talk all the time about camp and stuff and its awsome I'm gunna get to see him in 29 days! AHH! lol... so yea.. I should be studying for my Chem test... but I'll do that inna bit. Track today was pretty good. I felt a lot better then I did yesterday. We did a really good 30 min with like no stopping and then some strides. Had PSAT class today, and that didn't go too well but not bad enough to really disappoint me. I had a great dinner so that's what probably boosted my spirits to make me happy (chicken cutlet, sald, mashed potato, and some spaghetti). Okay, that's it. I'm out, gonna talk to Mick and Ange some more and then go to bed. Night! x0x0x0x0x

      Well today was an alrite day. I woke up and I helped my mom cook for tomrrow. We made baked stuffed apples (green apples, baked in apple cider, with dried fruit filling inside), an onion dip, and I made stuffed mushrooms all by my self. I musta chopped up like 50 stems to stuff the mushrooms with. So, then I had told Jake I'd chill with him today since we didn't get to the other night and we went to see "Haunted Mansion"... it was very Disney but kinda cute. Then, Debra and Erica came to my house and we went to Dom's party. It was fun... we hung out and then summa the boys started to go into the pool (it was indoors) and then me and Deb started to push Erica in but we weren't gonna but then then boys stepped in and threw her in. Then Deb got thrown in and I begged for mercy since I hadda white shirt on but yea... I got thrown in any ways. Then we went into the sauna and we looked at "Where's Waldo" books. Then we made Dom give us clothes cause we were wet and then we had some pizza and then I came home and Greg called. I wasn't even gonna answer the phone. But I did and now hes ready to be my fiend again but he still wants to hook up and I told him I don't want to so yea... I'm not gonna, sorry.  Yea, thats about it. Tomorrow my family is commin over here so I'm gonna get to bed. Much Love x0x0x0x0x0x0xx0x0

      I think those are the lyrics anyway. So yea, my weekend was alright I guess. On Friday I went to Barns and Noble and made a friend named Jake. Then Saturday I had my race and we'll just fast forward there. Then I went shopping and FINALLY bought some cute jeans in Abercrombie. Like, when ever I go in there for jeans they are either too long or too short or too loose or too tight in some places but I founda cute pair. I'm prob gonna wear them tomrrow for dress down. So, yea, then Sunday I hung in at my dads and Aunt Donna, Uncle Bruno, and Mario came over and we hung out. It was fun. Today was actaully good day. It went pretty fast and I didn't have Church History causea Lab so thats ALWAYS good. So yea.. I dunno today was just good... good karma. At track we only ran like 10 minutes and then we went and too some pictures for the year book. It was kinda sad though cause it was Coach Salerno's last day. He left us with this really good like paper with a really good saying on it. So.. yea.. I needa go clean my room and then I have a chem and a math test tomrrow so I should study. Much Love!! x0x0x

      Well today was a fun day. I woke up at like 1ish and then my mom took me to Barns and Noble and I hung out there by myself for a little while. I love goin there I always leave feelin relaxed and content. Though, today I read something that kinda freaked me out but it only made me realize how short life is. So then, I found these two books "Who Moved My Cheese" and "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens" they seemed like really good books so I got them and then Erica called and asked I was doin anything, I told her no, so I made plans to go to the movies witha all them. So Erica and Melanie picked me up and we went to go see "Scary Movie 3" with Debra, John, Stasi, Jay, Rob, and Ruben. It was okay, the movie wasn't too bad. Then we went to Woodrow Diner to get something to eat and then we went to Ruben's house and hung out there till about 11:30. It was fun I hadda really good time and we were talkin in the car (me, Ez, and Melly) and we were like "Yea, I hate when guys like open up and get all emotional and when you seem to be the man in the realtionship." and how "Farrell guys seem to be the most emotional for some reason, like all of them are just WAY too sensitive and adoring. Being around testosterone all day must be the reason"... it was funny. I felt bad for Scott lol. So yea... now I'm gonna chill out and go to sleep in a little bit cause I gotta get up early and go rake Clove Lakes park for next week. Peace x0x

Me, Fea, and Rob went to see "Elf" it was really cute, got me in the Christmas spirit. It was funny at the end everyone is singing that "You better not pout, you better not cry..." song and Rob started singing along. It was a really cute movie. Then we went to Wendy's... it was lovely... OH but in drivers ed today, I was driving back to school and "Get Low" came on so we listened to it, and then 50 Cent came on sayin "Yo, yo, ya'll this is 50 Cent" or something like that and Mr. C goes "Fitty sent, yea yea." and I dunno why but it just struck me as SO funny I was like hysterical laughin while I was drivin. And like he kept sayin funny stuff and John and Fea were being stupid in the back seat and I dunno I only laughed that hard once all week so it was a good Friday. I missed Debra though, she wasn't there today. So yea... I'm gonna go and watch Premium Blend.. a lotta comdey never hurt anyone. Much love x0x0x0x

Like I was close with her, and she was always really nice to me and all but these people were like with her every day and stuff. I dunno, I cried though. I hate funerals. And like, theres like nothing to say ya know? Like what do you say to someone who just lost someone they love so much like that ya know? I told Dino and Patty Ann that she was in Heaven and I know shes gonna cause a ruckas up there. Then, after we said goodbye to her, we went to see Grandpa Mario. It was nice to see his grave. It's really nice. It's like this angle like woman playin the piano and underneath is like a few notes. It's nice. But... then when I was in the car on the way home Deb called and she came to my house around 1:30 and then we hadda go to drivers ed and now I'm gonna chill out and then Erica is gonna come ova and we are gonna chill and then I'm gonna go to bed cause I have a meet tomrrow.

       I got the chance to sit down with the ever so hot, the ever so Canadian, Dave. Here's what he had to say about the issues that count (such as ice cream flavors, and wearing womens clothes)   Me: okay, dave... what is your full name? Dave: David Alexander Scarrow (no punching required, I know i'm a nerd already) Me: whens your b-dey? Dave: October 1st, 1987 Me: are you currently avialable? Dave: LOL Dave: .... Dave: that means yes Me: ah i see Me: well what do you look for in a potential signifigant other? Dave: Honesty is most important. She needs to be real. Intelligence (in more ways than one), understands my messed up sense of humour, and can handle being with someone as shy and clumsy as me. Me: hummm i see... well thats nice.. whats your fave movie? Dave: Independence Day... that movie rocks, and i'm not even American. Me: ha ha ha how witty Me: lol Dave: btw, I love this sophisticated journalism Lauren. Me: thank you Dave: so professional Me: lol what about books? Me: do you like to read dave? Dave: not really... but my favourite book of all-time is "The Outsiders: Me: oo tahts a good one Me: if you could be ice cream, what flavor would you be Dave: it sure is, sophisticated journalism Lauren. Me: lol lol lol Dave: definitley vanilla... definitley sweet, but simple. Me: what topping would you want? Dave: assorted sprinkles Dave: for undisclosed reasons Me: o0o0o0o do you have something to hide dave? Dave: next question, please Me: hummm Me: lol Dave: I refuse to be attacked like this Me: no wait i still have more questions! Dave: fine, fine... i'm sorry for that outburst Dave: continue. Me: okay Me: waht is your idea of a perfect date? Dave: not too sweet... if they're too dry, they lose flavour and- oh wait... you don't mean the fruit, do you... Hm, well... i'd say finding something in commmon that we both love, and enjoying the evening just having fun. Nothing too fancy, just a good time. Me: LMAO Me: i htought you were gonna say an acatula date like.. nov. 2 or something lol Dave: lol, that was a possibility Me: ooo lol Dave: I really like your sophisticated journalism lauren... do you have a sophisticated journalistic boyfriend? Me: no i do not dave Dave: oh, really... interesting Me: very Me: :: wink wink:: Me: lol Dave: ooh... i'm getting very turned on by this interview Dave: I mean... i'm getting very informed by this interview Me: lol  Me: im glad Me: okay.. moving along Dave: "Well... I guess we'll be getting off together er- I mean, going down together I mean er-..." "It's ok, i'll just press the button on the stimulator er- I mean, elevator"  God bless the simpsons. Dave: yes, yes... moving along Me: okay... if you could wear any womens clothes, what would you wear and why? Dave: i'd say bra... it would be nice to live an active single woman lifestyle and still get the support I desperatley need. Me: LMAOOO Dave: are you ok, sophisticated journalism lauren? Me: yes.... your just makein me laff rele hard lol Me: okay.. how does it feel to be a canadian? Dave: i'm like so proud, eh? I live in an igloo and spend my weekdays hunting, and my weekends playing with our pet moose, eh? I play hockey in my spare time, talk really slow, and that's about it. --> Me: lol well thank you for your time dave... i hope our readers feel informed after reading and delving into the mind of a male teenage canadian Dave: thanks for having me sophisticated journalism new-yorker-barbra walters but much younger and prettier- Lauren. BTW, I don't really live in an igloo...  I LOVE YOU ALL!

      Okay, the other day, Erica and I came up with this cool idea. Well, it started out that we would have our like own island, like, in the tropics, and it would be our own country and us and our closest friends could live on and like if people wanted to come to see us they would need a visa issused by us and if they didn't have one they coulnd't come. But then we thought, "What if there were native people there? It wouldn't be nice to kick them out." So, we came up with an even BETTER idea. A BOAT! We named it the SJS No Worries cause this is like a floating paradise! Okay, there would be a big room for all the girls that like lived on the boat, and all the boys would get one too, and like there would be extra rooms called "Happy Rooms" for if any of us wanted to be alone or if when we docked we met someone we liked (wink wink). So, then there would also be a big pool, dining hall, and at the bottom there would be a like dancefloor and a place for a DJ or something and thats where we would party and stuff. And like, if any one but the people who lived on the SJS No Worries wanted to come aboard to visit, they would need to get a pass from us. Only the way they would get a pass would be all of the people who lived on the boat would have to vote on it. Like, say someone some of us liked wanted to come on, a majority vote would have to happen for them to get a 2 day pass and at the end of the 2 days if they have behaved then we will have another vote and then they can stay longer. But if ANYONE (except for me and Erica caues, hey, it's our boat) got annoying, they would have to walk the plank onto a row boat and row back home from where ever we are. They will be given food and water of course. So this thing would be soooo awesome cause like, it just would be. No one to like tell us what we can and cannot do, nothing to worry about. But just so we don't get stoopid, we would have schooling on Mondays from 8 a.m. till 8 p.m. a full day. It would all be good though cause then we have the rest of the week to do what ever we wanted. And it's not even like we would get bored cause we would like go from like country to country meeting people and partyin like rock stars do! It would be perfect. Just perfect.

      This is my euology for Charolet: You were someone so full of life. You always glowed with that certain something that so many people lack. You were always the one to come up and say hello to me first and you were never the last to crack a joke at my dad or at Mike. You were an awesome grandma, always ready to have fun. Mario will miss you. I know hes little and won't fully understand death till he is a little older but I can understand enough for both of us. I promise I'll take care of him and be the best big cousin I can be. You will be missed tremesly, especially at Christmas and New Years when your antics were always the biggest hit of the night. God wanted you close to him, and so he took you away from us but I know that one day, when it's my time to face St. Peter, you'll be there to open the gates for me. If you see Grandpa Roger, Grandpa Mario, Uncle Victor, Uncle Ronnie, Uncle Joe, Grandpa Ray and Grandpa Gene up there tell them I said hi and I miss them very, very much. You will always be in my prayers. God speed, and straight to heaven with you... Lauren

      Wow this weekend was like... well... there are no words to explain how great it was. I left school at 1:30 on Friday, my dad and me met Sheila at the airport. I slept most of the way to Ohare (the airport in Chicago), then we got there and got our bags pretty quick. There was like no one on the road so we got to the hotel pretty quick. And the FUNNIEST thing happened! Okay, so we are pullin up to the hotel and I see this kid who looks about my age and I think to myself "Wouldn't that be funny if it was Mick?" and I'll give you one guess who it was. If you said Justin Timberlake you were wrong, but if you said Mick, you'd be right! (lol) So yea, I jumed out the cab and ran to him and gave him a big hug. So, we all checked in and I met his mom and step-dad. So me, daddy, and Sheil went to our room. It was very cool. Very modern art-deco. So, we found a restaurant that was like 20 feet (50 at the most) away from the hotel, and all us (my family and his) went to eat at this really nice place. Our parents really seemed to hit it off. My dad (of course) talked like there was no tomrrow. Then, me and Mick went out side to wait for them cause they were paying and we were bored. So we are chillin outside and this guy in a Sponge Bob (it was Holloween keep in mind) and he goes to Mick, "Here's what you gotta do, you gotta buy this girl a sports car cause shes high equity (or something like that) cause shes beautiful." and then he just walked away. We were like... o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0okay... so then we got back to the hotel and our parents went out for drinks and we hung out for a while and then at 12:30 I hadda go back to my room. The next morning I woke up early and we met up with Mick and his family and Mick was gonna ride with us to Sheils friend Anns house and then they were all gonna show us a fast way to ND. So we get to Anns like 10 years later and then... we went to Notre Dame. I think it gets more beautiful every time I see it. So we get there and we walked around, we went to the place where we said goodbye after camp, we went to the ice staking rink, walked past the track, we went to the library were "Touchdown Jesus" is, and then we had to go to the stadium. The game was good... yea Notre Dame lost 37-0 but it was still a good experiance.  So then we walked to the bookstore and I got a new sweat shirt (me and my sweat shirts lol). So then (and I think this was the BEST part of the whole trip), I rode home in Mick's car and, I dunno.... this was just the BEST part of the trip. It was like, the most time we really had to be together ya know? So, we got back to the hotel, and then me and Mick went to get something to eat in the hotel restaurant and then me and him just hung out in the hotel, chillin for the little time we had left. So, then, the time finally came to say goodbye. It was hard. It was like... I dunno... just.. I felt like something wanted me to like, I dunno... stay there but I knew I had to go ya know? So, then, I turned around and walked into my room. The next morning (this morning actually) we woke up early and went to the airport. I kinda hoped I would see Mick this morning but, I didn't. So, yea.. then we got to the airport and onto the plane and GUESS who was sitting in front of me... Mick Foley, the wrestler... and this was no Mr. Lichter thing either (lol Erica)! I saw his name on his luggage that he was carrying with him on the plane. So, I slept the whole way home and then I went to my dads house and that's where I am now. So, it was a VERY great weekend. It was so much fun but I wish it had lasted longer. A lot longer. So, I'm going to go now, I'm watching "The Others". Peace x0x

      Hey all... It's almost Christmas! To tell the truth I'm not all that excited for it. I still have to get my mom some things cause I feel bad I only got her 3 little things so I'll head to the mall today I guess. I'm going to Erica's in a little while where me, her, and Deb are gonna exchange gifts. I got them really cute things but I don't want to say it on here cause I don't want them to read it.. ha ha ha. Yesterday was a good day. I watched movies in like all my classes so it was a really easy day. Then, at track, Coach K kinda scared me with this whole "Milrose" thing. It's this really big track meet at Madison Square Garden. I really wanna make it but I mean I'm not out to cut my team mates throats to get it ya know? But, she kinda freaked us all out. Then we did out workout and like I was just so fatigued (sp?) but, then was the party which was outside on the bleachers by the tennis courts. It was really fun we all just grabbed everything and drank all the stuff coach brought. It was a lotta fun. Just the whole team sitting there and enjoying each others company after a long workout. I love my team I really do. I can't wait till everyone comes over New Years Eve. It's not going to be the big party that I wanted but I mean just me and my close friends. It should be good. I hope Mick isn't disspaointed that it's not the big party I told him I was gonna have but I mean it should be fun.  I talked to Shawn and James the other day on the phone. It was so nice to hear thier voices again. And James did his Dr. Evil impression for me and God I was laughin SO hard like, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Canadians make everything better don't they? I actaully just got back from the mall, I started this post a while ago and then I had to go to Erica's and now I'm home. I got my mom, dad, and Sheila, some more stuff for Christmas.  But, Erica and Deb gave me really nice things. Deb gave me a bag and this hat I had wanted for the Cross Country Dinner. Erica gave me "Down With Love Chocolate" (LOL) and these speakers for my head phones that I have wanted for a while so I was really happy and (now I can tell you) I got Erica an Abercrombi shirt that says "Bring me to the Mistletoe" and underwear that say "Vixen" and "Prancer" and I got Debra Abercrombi PJ pants and underwear that say "Unwrap Me" and "Gifted". I thought they were cute lol. I think we are the only girls who buy underwear for each other lol. Then Barbra made us breakfast and then we chatted about how we miss being little and like Christmas when we were little. It was nice. It was how a Christmas Eve Morning should be spent. Well... If I don't talk to you again tonight or tomrrow, Merry Christmas and I'll talk to you all later! 5 Days Till We Are Mickorized!!! XOXOXOXOXO

      Well I know the fans of Lauren-deB (Dave, Shawn, and Randy) have been anxiously awaiting my new post just as much as I am when ever Writers Revolution (I expect $20 AMERICAN for that plug there Dave) doesn't update every day or so. Well there hasn't been much going on in Lauren Land or this crazy place called New York (Staten Island). I got a 1000 on my PSAT which is a hell of a lot better then I got on it last time so I was really happy and I e-mailed Greg saying thanks cause he helped me out a lot with it. Then there was the Cross Country Dinner/ Dance which was a lotta fun. I was so comfy in my jeans. I really wanted to wear sneakers but I didn't. I danced with Danielle, Debra, Erica, and just the whole team as a group. Then I danced with these three other guys, I'm not quite sure what school they were from but it was fun. It was a lotta fun. By far the best of the three total that I have been to. Things with Mick are going well. He will be here in about a week which is very cool. And my grades are doing very well! In fact, I just got word today that I got a 101 on my math test so GO ME! I calculated my avg. and its an 89 but I gotta also wait and see what my midterm avg. is and then I gotta avg. that in with the 89 and then with the 85 from last quarter. But all in all I been workin hard and kickin ass. :: hiya :: So yea... not much drama which is good though the whole family thing flares up every now and then. But I'm gonna follow my own words and say "keep hope alive". I'm thinking of having a trial. Not a like "I'm Right, Your Wrong" trial but a like trial so that each side can hear out each other in a neutral place and we can discuss, and solve the problem. I don't think my mom or aunt will go for it though but hey I think it would probably help to put things in perspective for them ya no? See what each side has to say right from the others mouth instead of from other people.  But, Christmas is comming! YAY!! I think Canada has the same Christmas as us but those fready deaky Canadians might just switch things with their New Prime Minister (those who saw South Park last night will know what I'm talkin about.... I think you understand.... lol). OH YEA!! We caught the bastard Saddam Hussein (sP?)!! Go America, I tell ya. We just rock the casba, litteraly... ha ha, knee slapper. AND I saw  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King  the other day with Dave (no I wan't imagining, there was a REAL Dave there) and Vin Fea. It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!!! Omg It was just PHENOMINAL (sP?). It was deff up there with one of the best movies of all time. A little long, yes (3 hours and 20 minutes), but worth every minute?   HELL YES  !! So yea. That's about all that's really been going on. Not too many people have told me deffinite answers about my New Years Eve party yet. I really hope like everyone comes cause I mean I really wanna have a big party ya no? But yea, that's enough for now. Much Love x0x0x0x0x

      Well today I finally got outta the house for the first time since Friday. It felt so nice to walk around places other then my house. I woke up around 11 and showered (it was lovely) and then Erica called me with the bus times. I walked to Annadale Train Station and got the bus, then I hadda transfer cause I got like, the right bus, but the wrong one at the same time lol.. I dunno you figure it out... So I get to the mall and Deb said her car wasn't starting so Erica go there and we ate at Johnny Rockets and Deb met up with us there and we walked around from 2 to like 5:30. I got a really cute skirt. It's rele like, short and I didn't have enough money to get the shirt that went with it so I didn't get it but i found something cute at my house but I dunno what shoes to wear with it. But, yea, my mom flipped out out me about it. She said its not a good color for winter and like its too short and she don't want me to wear it out but I will anyways lol. Alrite thats enough for today. Peace x0x0x0x0x0x

      Hey people. Well there really isn't much to post. Thanksgiving was a blast! It was so great to see all my cousins again. I miss them like so much I never get to really spend any time with them. It was cool, I spent most of my time with cousin Mikey whos my age so I guess I should stop callin him Mikey. But, we had a good time, there were like 10 pillow fites. Not the ::poof:: ow ::poof:: ow... these were like ::BAM:: OW! ::BAM:: OW MY EYE! ::BAM:: THATS IT YOUR DEAD! Then we all snuck away and went for a walk on one of the trails through the woods by my house. Mike and Dommie (another one I can't call by their kiddy name any more)... Mike and Dom were like tee-p-ing (sp?) trees as we walked along... singin a song... heh just playin.  So when we got back we thought we were gonna get in trouble cause Debbie and Judy were standin outside all "Where were you?" and we said we went for a walk around the block.  Then it was back inside to my room where 10 boys ranging from 5-16 had a few (5) dogpiles on cousin Lauren. Hurt like hell, and all the boys got hit down below AT LEAST once. It's so funny the faces they make lol.  So yea, then, school is goin on, that could be be a bit better but.... Mick is commin in 24 days which is awesome.  Okay, thats about it. Much Love x0x0x0x0x

      Well... I think I'm in a lotta trouble... I don't know if im gonna pass my Chem midterm tomrrow.. its like... looming before me like a big gigantic evil thing thats out for my blood or something. It's like... this episode of Sister Sister when like, she opens the test and it screams or something. But, on a lighter note... me and Micks "anniversery" was yesterday. It started six months ago yesterday that we said we liked each other. We've come along way. I really hope he can come, it's like... I hate sayin goodbye but, sayin hello makes it all worth while. Today I was kinda boring. My tests were supposed to be today but like everyone got all worried about the snow so they were pushed back till tomorrow. They got all worried for like nothing cause there was only about 5 inches on the ground. I went for a good run today too. I had my MP3 player and I put good running songs on it and I was like going at an awesome pace and I don't know I felt awesome. Then, when I got home I did some strides down my block. I feel so ready for Saturday guys. I really think we have a chance, we just gotta show them that we want it and what we are willing to do to get it. I'm just really sick of people who say they want things and they don't put in the work to get it, especially when they have a chance. And we HAVE a chance. We aren't out of the running yet. We just gotta get focused. I hope you all been running while we haven't had practice. But... tomorrow should be okay. The test'll suck, but then theres practice and that should be good. Then a little later Erica and I and I think Deb are gonna go to Mrs. Volpe's house for rosery then we are gonna go to Debs cause the team is meeting there for a pasta party.Well, I was just takin a break so I gotta go back to studying. Peace x0x

      I felt the Tripple C post wasn't sufficient enough for today so I thought I'd ramble a bit. Today was alright. I took my English Regent and it wasn't so bad. My essays were okay, just as long as I passed it. After school I came home and I passed out on my white couch in my living room after reading a bit. I figured it would put me to sleep and I was right. Erica called and told me she would call me when her mom got home to take her to my house so we could go for a run.  So, she got here around 4:20 and we stretched for a few minutes and then we went for a run. She told me about things with Doofy and how she felt about it and I told her not to worry and that she knows Deb and I would be there for her unconditionaly. It's just so strange they aren't together any more. It's like when I was told my whole world came crumbling down, like... hell was cold, pigs flew past the window, and there was mooing outside (the cows came home, GO COWS!, sorry quick South Park refrence). I kinda know what EZ was goin through, and then that douche bag e-mailing her. God... hes so gay... I just hope this week is like the beautiful sky after a storm or something. Last week was just like the week from hell. I was in a mood, me and Mick kinda snipped at each other now and then, I broke myself, Mick's not feelin well, the age of Eirca-and-Doofy came to an end, and to top it off... Midterms. I was also thinking of my non-existant writing carreer. I always loved it, but I mean... so many people do it better ya know? And I really don't have any good ideas for a good story. I mean, I wanna be like Tolkien ya know? I wanna create my own world. One in which I can twerk and tweak and make my own and I want people to read about it's epic battles and I want what I write to live forever, way past when I'm gone.   x0x

      LOL Melly just told me about an interesting little tiffle with Greg. Apparently he had e-mailed Erica tellin her how she ruined his life and when Melly told him off he called us all cunts. Now, is it just me or has Greg been using that term a bit much lately? I think it's the word of the month or something. So, Melly and I have instituted Tripple C (Me/ Cunt, Melly/ Cunt, Erica/Cunt). As new members arrive (and their certainly will be with Gregs use of the word these days) the name will change. Till then...  vive la Tripple C !

      Yes, I did. I was running my 4x200 and.. I was comming up to the last turn and I was in first and I felt a 28/ 27 comming and then... I fell. The one the good thing I got outta it was my own Armory "OH!" and my pitty clap.... yeah right I wanted to kill myself, figures I pick one of the biggest meets of the season to fall. I got pretty scraped up from the track (I left my mark on the track, ha ha!)... I went to the medics and afyer he cleaned me up I went to leave and when I pushed off my hand to get up and my wrist really hurt. So me and Melissa are walking back and I go "Ya know, my wrist kinda hurts." and Meliss told me to go back and check it out. The he did a test and told me I might of fractured it and for Melissa to go get coach cause I have to go to the ER for an X-Ray. I was pretty bad, cryin a bit. I  was just asking over and over if I would be able to run next week. Coach said she wasn't mad about the race so that was okay but, I was syill upset. So one wild walk to the ER later and after calling my parents, Coach and I waited for my dad to come and when he did I got called in for testing. An hour and a half later I was told it looks like either a hairline fracture or the way my bone is growing in. So, they put me in this like semi-hard cast and told me to make an appointment for next week. Good thing is I can still run, thank God. Well that was my day. Fun, right? Thing is I like tripped over myself ya know? There was no one in front of me, not too far behind me and I wasn't near the metal edge of the track, so I musta tripped ovewr myself, right? Well, typin w/ one hand is gettin hard so I'm out x0x.

I can't wait to get out of here... not even to just like get out of Staten Island but to just like leave all these gay people who think they know what's goin on and really they have no idea... and it's not like your everyday ordinary "omg did you hear what she did last weekend" kind of thing its things that only I would be able to tell people and they twist what I say around and just be all gay...

      Okay well not yet, but I have managed to get up a new comments system! How cool am I? Well.. not very but oh well. I'm just glad to have another one up. Plus I needed something to destract me from that silly little thing called studying. I have my U.S. History midterm on Friday. That should be a blast. I was just talkin to Deb about like, well about a lotta things really. Like have everyone has the right to be happy and be themselves. Like, I don't know. I think that yea things are gonna get hard but in the end I mean, you just gotta think about how your gonna feel tomrrow you know? Like... if theres something good, and it works, then why push it away ya know? And we were sayin about how like we feel mature and we just don't wanna deal with shit and she felt bad for makin me listen to the "bad" Debra and I mean, I didn't mind I mean, we all get like that sometimes, I mean I was like that for the most part of the day. I got really weird with my mom and I even had a little attitude to Mick, I don't even know why. Silly female hormones. But... I don't know... then we got into the whole thing about how like I don't like to drink. I mean I just don't see much point in it. Like, yea, okay, lets go out and spend money on something thats gonna impare our judgement and after a while make me feel gross and make me puke. But the fun doesn't stop there, oh no, the next morning you get to wake up with a spilitting head ache AND if you drank enough, your track skills will have just been shot for no reason. Now THAT sounds like a GREAT thing to do. Having said all that, I do plan on drinkin when track ends in the summer, after Notre Dame camp of course. I'd rather not make that big of an ass of myself this year when I go. I'd like to show the coaches there, if the same ones are there, that I came a long way from last year and I mean I just feel like if I drink and fuck up I won't. Plus, I mean my parent's trust means a lot to me for some reason. I worked hard to keep that up and I mean my parents know I'm a good kid and I kinda like that. But.. anyways... thats enough rambling. Oh, James (the Canadian) if you read this, or if you got any of my e-mails tell me the situation with El and if he can stay with you and any other Florida details. I think hes gonna be kinda mad at me once I do reply to his e-mails. Peace all x0x

       Dear Friends, Family, and Foods      We, the braces of Lauren deBueriis have decided we have over stayed our welcome on the teeth of everyones favorite freckle face, though, do not despair, hopefully she won't wear her retainer and we'll be back faster then you can say "You've got brocali in your teeth!". We will never forget the good times we have all shared together. We will be taking with us the happy memories of cutting open Lauren's mouth, making indents on the inside of her mouth, making food get lodged inbetween our brackets and having Lauren look incredibly stupid tryin to pick it out. Along with that goes the countless times Lauren has almost choked and died on the wax she tried to put on us to hurt her less. Ah... good times, good times.      We hope our legacy will live on forever (and ever amen) as Lauren grows into her new and improved teeth. Maybe now Lauren won't have to cut things (like chicken fingers, pizza, and mozzerella sticks) in fear that tiny little parts of the food she is eating will get stuck in us. And who knows! Maybe, JUST MAYBE when we are gone, Lauren will become more attractive and not look like a 12 year old (us and the freckles combined make a mean team in making Lauren not look almost 17).      So farewell, and good riddence.                                 - Lauren's Upper Braces

      Well this weekend has been a wild ride. Well... not really but it was fun. Friday I went to see Morgans basketball game. I ran into Mrs. Zaccheo and I talked to her for a minute. Then, after the game we all went to Ciros. It was really fun, I love our team. The people are just awesome. Around the end of dinner Melly and Greg Rosetto walked in and I talked to them for a bit, then we all went back to Stasi's house. I left very educated. Saturday at the race I ran pretty well it was a good time. I PRed for my 200 and my 300 time wasn't too bad. Finally the practice and chugging endless amounts of water is paying off.  Then the rest of this weekend has really just been chillin and sleeping. Not much studying which I should be doing. My room had just been declared a disaster area by the Messy Room Association of America. I'll clean it tomrrow. Got a whole latta laundry to do. Well.. I think that's about it. x0x

       Okay, I'm really bored and I was thinking about Robin's last night so I figured I'd make a list of things that annoyed and made me laugh pertaining to the DJ's.    The Good  5. They get you dancing 4. They play good music 3. They have good bodies 2. They hand out those cool hats, sunglasses, inflateable microphones, twirlie things, and glow sticks  and the number one good thing about Sweet 16 DJ's...  1. They can make you feel sexy and pretty when they dance with you... and a few nice words can go a long way on the Self-Esteem Meter   The Bad  5. They dance so good they seem gay 4. They play gay music that only the parents wanna dance to cause it brings them back to the "glory days" 3. They play gay group syncronized dancing songs like "The Cha Cha Song" 2. The don't play the songs you request even when they pinky swear they will  and the number one bad thing about Sweet 16 DJ's...  1. They think they are the "Buffet Line Lords"... they think that they have the power to tell us when we can and cannot go up to get food even when people tell us we can.. and then they go and be a dick and say "Thank you Table 8 and 9 for getting up when they weren't asked and making the buffet line long".... penis

      I hate goin to bed in a bad mood. It always carries through to the morning. I woke up and hung out for a while. Then I went to Barns and Noble and bought "Rudy" and a book I needed for school and another book I found that looked pretty interesting. I read most of it in the store but my mom called and told me she was picking me up so I bought it, too. I dunno, today was one of those I-really-miss-Mickey-days. I just thought about him all day and I dunno it kinda made my mood worse. Kinda I just miss him a whole not. But, February isn't too far away, that is if he comes in February, and if he does, APril isn't far away from that. And, even if he doesn't, April isn't too far away from now. Right? Course. I'm watchin "Rudy" right now. This movie just totally hits me right here ::points to heart:: man, ya know? I really wanna go there. I totally know how Rudy feels. It's funny cause parents are supposed to bring you up and stuff and all my mom does really is tell me that I really should look into other places besides ND, and when I told her I was thinkin of St. Mary's she just kinds laughs like it's not a big deal or I really won't go away or something. I really don't think she gets that I'm going. No one really gets it. Like... I don't think any one thinks I'm really gonna go. The movie is at the part when Rudy is gettin ready to go to Notre Dame, right after Pete dies. I'm in one of those moods where I wanna do the same. Just jump on a bus, head to Indiana. Live in Mickey's upstairs (lol). I think, if I had to make my own perfect little world, there would be lots of like... space. Lots of green. Rolling hills, a lake, a pool, a nice house. And all my friends would be my neighbors. We would have our own little neighborhood. Raise our kids together. They would all be friends. Just live in our own little worlds where like... I dunno... things made sense... didn't always change, and when change did happen it was slow and easy to adapt to. None of these bad things like, heart ache, and pain, and saddness, missing someone so much that it kills. Heh, I kinda sound like Holden Cawfeild (sp?) don't I? Eh I really don't know what I'm sayin any more, just kinda babbling aren't I? Aw man, Rudy just walked onto the football feild. God I miss that place. I wish I could stand on that feild. I mean sitting in the bleachers was awesome, imagine STANDING actaully STANDING on the feild? Okay, I think I've rambled enough. Much Love x0x

      Well tonight was a bone-a-fied blast and half. It was Robins sweet 16, and I dunno about everyone else but I had a great time. It was like straight dancin and eatin and drinkin (soda and shirley temples lol). One of the DJs (did you ever notice after a sweet 16 there is always a DJ story? lol) was all up on Melissa, Debra, and Me a little bit. It was mad funny, he said I had the best milkshake (I was dancin to it and he said this one thing I did was the best or something). I had a great time, and I wore the hat Deb got me for Christmas. The DJ was callin me J. Lo and tellin me he wanted my hat. I was like, um I'm not J. Lo and you can't have my hat... biotch!!! Well, I didn't say biotch, it just kinda fit in w/ the sentence lol. So... yea... thats about all thats goin on... tomrrow I dunno what imma do. Probably start my Chem review sheet or something. How sad and pathetic am I? Well, night x0x

      Well gee... the week gets better and better don't it? And now I'm lookin at like, mad time of Midterm review? AWESOME... just AWESOME. I'm like totally in everything is fallin apart mode at the moment. The one thing I thought was stable is just totally like... (racks brain for big SAT word.... can't find one) messed up. Well, I'm not really sure if it's messed up but it sure looks that way. I'm totally dreading midterms, and second honors is like a world away, and so is something (one) else. Eh... I guess I'll have to deal... I think things are going bad cause I missed the Legion of Mary meeting yesterday to go to Millrose. Which we didn't even make it to. But... yeah... I have a big religion test I didn't even study for. Whop-de-friggin-do. x0x

      Hey guys! Awesome news! I get the tops of my braces off February 2 at 9:15 a.m.! I have been askin my orthadontist to take them off for like... since the first time I got them lol. The bottoms have to stay on for a little while though. It was so funny, when I asked him if he could take them off he goes, "I'll make you a deal. We'll take the tops off next time but the bottoms have to stay on for another two months." I was like "OKAY!" and when it was all written down and stuff he goes "Congradulations, you made it half way." and then since I was like the last person to get worked on that day everyone in the office heard and like a chorus of "Congradulations, Lauren!" rang out lol. I felt like I really achieved something rahter then just have these metal things on my teeth for two years and three months. It will be a relief to have them off. And just in time for when Mick comes again in February and for my 17th birthday. Kick ass to the extreme man. Okay South Park is on, gotta go! x0x

      Okay guys, today wasn't AS bad as yesterday but I swear he's haunting me. Every song I heard today reminded me of him and I like couldn't escape it. My mom and me went to Short Hills Mall today and like she can't listen to like fast music when shes drivin so we had on a light station and ALL they played were songs that reminded me of him. Then, we get to the mall and I'm looking for Abercrombie and theres more light music!!! The techo that usually makes me squirm in A&F was a relief for once. I must have heard "A Thousand Miles" and "When I'm Gone" and "Here Without You" like 5 times each today. Then I was hit w/ a wammay in the car when they played "So Into You" and right after "Walked Right Out Of Heaven". I wanted to throw myself in front of a bus. Least I got some nice things though. I got 2 new pairs of jeans and these two zipper up sweater like things and this one white shirt. Nice stuff. Now I'm home and the hot dog and Wendy's burger I had earlier is catching up to me and I'm not feelin too hot. I'm gonna stay in tonight. Get going on that homework thats due on Monday, clean my room (Lord knows it needs it), and I'll prob veg out like usual. BUT! Don't you love the new layout??? Or at least the way I've twerked it? I felt so geeky, I was like sitting an inch from the computer screen and just like  trying to figure out what the codes meant and then I did and it was like a revelation or something. Well thats enough. x0x

      Well.. Mick left yesterday. Needless to say I'm depressed about it all. He took the ferry to the train to Annadale to get to me on the first night. It was so great seein him run up the stairs and huggin him was awesome. The frist night we went out to dinner at the Marina Cafe. It was lovely. Then he came to my house and we exchanged Christmas gifts. He got me some really nice candles, some perfume, and a bracelet that had some charms on it. I loved it but I couldn't like give him a kiss or anything till later cause his parents and my mom decided to watch us open gifts. I don't think they liked my mom too much for some reason but... any ways. I was showing everyone my bracelet. I love it you have no idea. Then on the second day, I went to practice and then I came home and I had to get ready to go to the city for a 5:30 dinner so we would have time before the play ("Little Shop of Horrors") started. But.. New York City traffic wasn't on my dad and my side so we ended up getting to the restaurant at 6:15 and it was only when we got there did we realize that the play started at 7 and not 8 as we had thought. So, I ate my baked clams and some bread and after a bit we had to go. The play was really good. Very entertaining and the boy next to me and the fact that he was next to me made it all the more better. So, after, we went back to the hotel so Mick could get his things and then my dad had called a car for us back into Staten Island. So one lovely car ride later Mick was at my house! lol. So... then what happened... oh yea... we'll just skip the night time activities cause those are going to be my happy memories. The next morning, we woke up, I made mediocre pancakes (but they were okay, not THAT bad), and then after a little bit me and Mick decided to crash my teams practice for a little while so everyone who wasn't comming to my party could meet him. It was alright, he got to meet the people who make this island a paradise for me. Then, we walked back to my house and again, we will leave those happy memories to me. My party was alright I guess. A speed bump or two but not too bad. I didn't have that much fun at it, I think I had the most fun when me and Mick were just like, I dunno talkin. Cousin Mikey goes "You look like your havin fun." and I was like, "No, not really." and he goes "Well, you're laughin and smiling. It's cause he's here (points at Mickey), isn't it?" and I was like, "Yea." lol. Me and Mick kissed at midnight and I swear after midnight I just wanted ::hem hem:: certain people ::hem hem:: to leave and only my faves to stay. Nah, though, Phil is cool, Marc too. After the party, Cousin Mikey graciously went upstairs and left me and Mick alone. Though there was fun going on, I was really, really upset and sorta started bawling. I couldn't help it! I was missin him already and I still had another full day with him.  We woke up kinda early and then my dad picked us up and brought us to Long Island. Mick met Mario and we had to deal with silly questions like "Are you two in love?" and "Are you going to get married?" and "Do you love him?" and "Do you love her?". He (Mario) is so like intrigued by like teenagers and realtionships and girls body parts its a little urking that hes only 6. lol.  Mick and I spent most of the night in my room upstaris with the door open cause it being closed would have only made people suspicious. More happy memories to reflect on. He got kinda upset about leaving and then like, them leaving kept on being delayed so me and him just kinda started to hang out like normal but I felt like crap cause my stomach was goin crazy and the thought that he was leavin was still in the back of my mind.  We thought up a few alternatives to him leaving. One was to lock ourselves in my bedroom and never come out. One was to stuff me in his duffle bag and take me back with him and I could live in his upstaris and no one would ever know. The third was to just wait out some more months before we will see each other again and then wait till after my senior year for me to come out there for college and stuff. We chose the duffle bag approach but then thought better of it. Airport security might ask some awkward questions if I was found.  Then, he hadda leave. I said bye and thanks to Curt and Gina and then gave him one last hug and kiss and... that was it. My great days were over. I just got so used to wakin up and him bein one door away. But... I'm gonna have to push on I guess. Can't go on all depressed. Alright, talk to you later.  x0x

      Okay. I saw the "Jesus Movie" today with Mike and here are my thoughts of it: I thought it was very powerful then anything. More then sad, more then something that makes me proud of my faith and deffinitly not something that would make me hate Jews. I mean, yeah I'll still joke about how they killed Him and all but I mean, they really only played a small part. In then end, it was everyone. The scourging scence I couldn't watch. I covered my eyes for the most part. The parts that got to me most were the parts with Mary. You could just see the anguish in her eyes and it made you feel for her, like you were her, watching your son go through all that pain. I mean, how do you do that? Wether what He was who He says He was (and as a Catholic I firmly beleive he was), how do you watch your son being beaten and wipped and have his skin ripped off, then have to watch him carry a cross and die on it. Those were hard scens too.... at one point I just like grabbed Mike's arm I just hadda hold onto something. It was just very powerful and I felt like comming home and saying a Rosary or something.  I think it was all in all a very good, and, as I've said, powerful movie. I like couldn't take my eyes off the screen, well execpt at certain parts. Like, watchin Simon help Him carry His cross, watchin the woman wipe His face, watching the Romans beat Him, watchin Him gettin nailed to the cross was just something that makes me proud to be a Catholic ya know? It's like, I think that from now on, when they are teaching about the Stations of the Cross and about His Ressurection they are going to show that movie. It is deffinitly going to go down in history in some way shape or form. There are really no words to describe the impact I feel. I know it's kinda weird and all, to be so effected by a movie but this was just so... powerful lol. Like, you read about it, take tests about it, learn it and know it by heart but you never really like... are truly able to experiance it... and now... you are. As to the whole "Anti-Semitism" thing I think thats just retarded. I mean, if you hate Jews this is only going to highten your hatred but I mean if you never cared before you wont care now. Like I said, in the end it was everyone. I really think everyone should see that movie. No bout-a-doubt it.  x0x0x0x

      Peni= Penis plural  Okay, I saw EuroTrip last night and let me just elaborate on my love for europeans. They are just so funny. Especially British people. Like the ones in the movie, I can TOTALLY see Elliot being like one day. All like drunk and raving and going on about Manchester United (its a soccer team). The French, well they suck so we kicked them in the balls and the Italians are horney bastards who say "Escusi" or w/e after they attempt to molest you. Sounds like fun. Who's up for a trip to Europe? Though I have NEVER seen so many peni in my life. Like... peni and boobs were the majority of that movie. Now, boobs I can handle cause frankly I see them everyday, but peni..... I mean, like.. these weren't even young perky-peni they were like.. old... flappy... wrinkled... it was gross.   So yeah... the meet did not go over as well as I had hoped. Coach was happy though so what ever. I ran 68 for my first 400 and 69 for my second I wanted to like kill myself. Coach said that considering I haven't really been working out as much as I usually am they are good times but I still think I could have done much better. I mean, I just gotta work it harder I guess you know? Like, on my last laps I kept tellin myself to punch it and go but like, I dunno. I mean I was on my toes and stuff and I was kickin but I guess I wasn't kickin enough. Oh well. I'll just have to get to work and start concentrating on outdoors. I think I'll be running 800's this season again. That should be an adventure. I haven't run an 8 since like last outdoors. This year indoors I was mostly 2's and 4's. I'm either doing the 400 or the 100 at Penn this year that's for sure but I want the 400 and to do the 400 I better start poppin 65's or at least low 66's soon. Okay enough track rambling.  So yeah, another Saturday night and I'm home alone. Heh, sounds like the beginning to a bad Deli/ Grocery Store novel or a song or something. But hey, story of my life.  Got e-mails from Shawn and James today. Those guys are awesome.  x0x

      For the Espanol impared that means "7 Months". Today is 7 months to the day that me and Mick started to like each other. x0x0x hun.  Tonight should be a good night. Though we are going to the Atrium and I HATE the Atrium but hey it's Erica's b-day night and as long as we are all together the location shouldn't matter. I don't know what we are doing afta but I think we are doing something. Who knows? Not me.  I got to talk to 2 out of the 4 of the Canadians. I talked to Dave and Randy a little while ago. I tell ya they are full of sh-... I mean... awesomness beyond comprehension (just kidding guys x0x).  I've actaully come up with a good story line for a short story. And I know my short stories usually run like 20+ pages but this one seems good and short. It's like, kinda based on a song Erica told me about. Like, this guy breaks up with this girl and he realizes what and idiot he was about it. And it's from a guys point of view so... I guess I'll have my work cut out for me since I am penis-less.   You know what song I love? "Hanging By A Moment", I forgot who sings it but I love that song. It's like been out for mad long but they play it every so often and when they do my love for it just comes right on back. I should download it. I'll do it later.  Well that's all for now. x0x

      Okay... they day JUST started to pick up at like 9 p.m. lol Okay, I thought the day was going to go really bad and then I went to track and I realized it can get a lot worse. Coach told me I can't go see Mick during Easter break causa Penn. So I got all upset cause like I miss him like crazy and then Coach K goes  "Keep your hormones in check."  Does she think I'm a horny little girl who can't keep her boyfriends penis out of her mouth? Not cool coach SO not cool.  So then I come home and I been thinking of trying to get out there in March and when I told Mick about the whole problem he really didn't seem too upset thought I'm sure he was... he was... I swear... And so I looked up like flight things and stuff and then when my mom came home I told her about it and she's like "Okay. Sure. If it's okay with daddy it's okay with me." You have no idea I was like "Really?"... like my world was rocked, my mind was blown, pigs flew, and the cows came home. So now all we need is the approval of Daddy-Do to make it official. x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x I'm happy... deal with it.

      Well... this weekend was pretty fun. Mel and I went to my dads and we had an good time. Sunday we went shopping in the Americana and that was fun. I bought stuff in A&F and I bought a Coach bag. It's really nice. I felt so like, rich lol. We went into like all the ritcy-titsy stores like Gucci, Louis Vitoun (sp?), Fendi, Burberry (sorry if I am buchering these stores names) and were like pointing to like the bags and stuff and goin "Oh my God! Melly I have the same one at home!" and "My friend has that bag." and "I'll have to have Daddy come pick this up for me later." It was fun.  And I got a new phone! It's really nice. It like glows blue and it's got a color screen and it's got that M Mode thing... ah... I love it. I wanted a camera phone but, I like this one.  And my dad told me that since he and Sheila wanna get a new car, I get the green 4Runner!! How funny! I'm gonna get it repainted though. Black probably.  So.. anyways... yeah.. today was Monday... nothing much to say about it really. x0x

      Okay you guys, this is deffinitly going to be me and my friends when we are old old and decrepid and can't get around on our own.  I was walking down one of the wings in the mall today, and I saw these two old people a man and a woman on their old people mobility scooters laughing and going as fast as they could, racing each other.  How great is that?? That is deff gonna be Eirca, Mel, Deb and Me when we are like 80 with our old lady hair cuts and our stockings falliing aruond our anckles. And let us not forget the floral pattern house dresses that will become normal day attire.   LOL Being old will be fun if I have them with me. We are deff gonna be those old people that have been through so much together and like knew each other so long that we are sick of each other and like we yell all the time about who is going to die first.   Ah... the momor- well.. they aren't really memories cause they haven't happened yet.  So.... lets rephrase.... Ah... the (__insert word here__).... humm... what's a good word to put there? I dunno.  And OH MAN... I totally wanted to crawl into a corner and die today when I went into Finish Line. Now, Mick always tells me I look younger then him and I don't look my age and stuff but I thought he was just crazy. Okay, I was looking in Finish Line for this Jersey he wanted and when they didn't have it I just decided to return the shoes I had bought the other day and get the money back. So the girl goes "Didn't find anything to exchange these for?" and I said, "No, I was looking for something for my boyfriend but you guys don't have his size." and she goes "Boyfriend? How old are you?" Knowing what was coming I said, "17." and she goes "Oh my God, you look so much younger!" I was like "Yeah, I get that a lot." I wanted to like die.  Any ways... Lee Ann's sweet 16 tonight should be a blast and a half. I got a new shirt today and lets just hope my pants make it through the rinse cycle with out being destroyed. x0x

      Well the title kinda sums my day up doesn't it? I woke up, got my hair cut and its SHORT like SHORT like I don't think its been this short since 3rd grade or something. I like it though, it's more manageable now. I don't think Mick will like it very much, he said he liked my hair long. I'll post a picture tommorw, my camera takes pictures better when it's not dark out. Damn cheap thing. So then, I went to the mall and I went shopping. I bought a pair of shoes and I ended up not liking them so I'm gonna return them and get Mick a birthday gift w/ the money. He wants a jersey that they have so I'll just grab it. I also went into Abercrombie and had fun. I could have had more fun but the mall crowd was picking up and I still had more to do so I wanted to get out of there. I love going to the mall to shop when it's empty. It makes it easier to shop and stuff. So then I got makeup in Sephora with the gift card Deb got me and I got new clips in Essentials. Oh, and I got Lee Ann a nice gift from Guess so, I guess you can say I had a productive day. Then I came home and modeld for myself. It was fun. I love doing that as gay as it sounds. I put the best outfits together and and I just have a grand old time. Okay, stop laughin, I had nothing better to do with my time. Then later Joe came over for dinner with his poodle... yes, my mothers boyfriend has a poodle. He made me try lentals even when I told him I hated them (my mom used to force feed it to me... I guess im tramatized)... and surprise, surprise... I still hate them. Then I just randomly decided to go to Barns and Noble. I called up Erica and Melanie and Erica wasn't allowed to go so me and Melly went. It was fun. I found some good books on Notre Dame Football and stuff. Then, me and Melly talked about stuff and read Cosmo. And when we went to get coffee the guy thought I said "Cappuchino" instead of "Frappuchino". His bad.  That's  always an adventure. I always close that feeling so educated. And now I'm home again. Nothing really too eventful but still a day worth blogging. I wish I had something more interesting to put on here rather then just me tellin you what I did. That's why you all need to read   urlLink Writers Revolution   cause these Canadians rock the Casba. Okay, I'm out. Much love. x0x

      Well.. another Mickey visit has come and gone and they just seem to get better and better each time.   Friday: we went to Applebee's with Deb, Danielle, Dave, Fea, Melca, Simione, Danny, Melanie and Erica for Deb and my birthdays. Then, we all went back to Fea's and, alert the media, I beat Mick at air hockey! Did you ever think you'd see the day? I didin't.  Saturday: in the morning I woke up early and made pancakes then we hung out the whole day and then at night we went to dinner at Sweet Basil in Annadale. It wasn't that eventful a dinner excpet the whole "set price menu" thing was kinda gay. We'll just fast forward Saturday night, those are not the fondest of memories, but, I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. But I made a cake and that made it all better. Cake makes everything better. Yes... yes it does.  Sunday: that morning I woke up and made French (Freedom) Toast. I swear I get to be such a domestic when he comes here lol. Like, I just wanna cook and do everything for him... ug, its that whole "nurturing" thing I guess. So, then we hung out again durin the day, then at night we were gonna make it a Bockbuster Night but Blockbuster kinda dissappointed us so we just ended up watching Rudy and Old School, possibly 2 of the best movies ever made. Rudy being number one of course ("Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame...."). Sunday night, which was in my oppinion the best night, we had a great time. At around 2 a.m. we just started to get delusional and started naming our body parts and talking in funny voices and things like that. Might sound silly to you but it was really fun to us. Many an inside joke was born... and thank God that was the only thing.. lol juuuuuuuuust kidding.... there was no hanky-panky... well.. not much any ways.  Monday: or as I would like to call it for the duration of this post, D-Day. I kinda ran out of breakfast ideas (sad I know, the only two things I can come up with for breakfast are pancakes and French (Freedom) Toast), so we just skipped it. We got a cab to Brooklyn were we met up with my dad at my grandmas and we ate pizza there and then it was off to the airport.  I felt kinda bad cause like the last hour or so that I was gonna be with him I ended up falling alseep on his lap in the car.   But, then it was time to say goodbye. I dunno, I was really sad and all that, but I know I'm gonna see him again in about a month. It was funny, my mom goes "You should go visit him in April when you have time off." It was such a thank-you-captain-obvious moment that I just wanted to say "Dah." or something.   And... now... I'm just sitting here.... yeah... that's me... hi... how are you? I'm fine, thanks.  On a lighter note, I've decided to go get my hair cut and go shopping tomrrow. MmM MmM Bitch! x0x

      Well thats what it feels like at least. Today went MAD slow. I really hope the rest of the week isn't like this. It's just so tedious (YES SAT word!). It was a really calm day actually. Math, we just learned how to like figure out these things called Varience, Frequency, and Standard Deviation on our calculators, took a test in Spanish, Chem was Chem. Got my test back - 72 - shoot me in the face please. Mr. Thompson really didn't teach today, then came Art which is always fun cause Mrs. Volpe is AWESOME. Then, Mrs. Galligano was absent so English was a breeze cause Mr. Clark was our sub. Then lunch which is always an adventure, then History. Nothing too special. The one thing I love about Mondays is everyones always talkin about the drama that went down over the weekend.  AND!!!! DEBRA HAS A BOYFRIEND, DEBRA HAS A BOYFRIEND!!!! you go girl ::snap snap snap:: Guys I'm going to be 17 in 2 days. How sick is that? I think it's pretty sick. 3 days till Mickey. x0x

      It really was. Friday, Erica and I got into a scuffle with mall security ("So since your like a rent-a-cop, do you get like half the doughnut and half the coffee since your not the real deal?") Then Saturday at the meet, it wasn't all too bad. It was a good time and coach and I had a funny convo of like phrases in different laguages. Don't knwo what we said really but, it was good. Oh, and she told us she's going to Australia and New Zealand over the summer and if she finds love there she's not coming back. Let's start praying now.  LOL Just kidding. I dunno coach kinda grew on me.  Then... oh man and here's the killa.  I went to Erica's that night and we raided the liquer cabinet. Now, if any of you know me and Erica, you know we don't drink. It's just something we don't do. We went down in her basement, and took shots of a few differnet things lol. Um, I don't remember which ones we did but the Peach Shnopps (sp?) was the best. Then like we went upstaris to make chocoalte soup and I was like, dizzy. It was really funny. Then, we made the soup and hadda good time eatin/ drinkin it and then we played a few games of pool in which I won all b/c Erica kept gettin the 8 ball in. It was great. Lots of fun. Not something I'd do all the time, but it was okay to do every now and then. Whats funny is it took so little to even get us dizzied. Then we went online and I knew I was bad when I cuddnt even type. Like, I could, but I was like messin the words up. Then today I headed to the mall w/ mom and Joe and that was an adventure. I got new pants for Valentines Day (night) and new leather jacket.  And that was my fun filled weekend. Hope yours was just as good. 4 days till Mickey. x0x

      "Hands Down"  Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me. This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it.

      **Okay this is the speach by Lou Holtz I tweaked for Islands**  We gotta believe girls. This school was founded on faith and on belief. Everything has been done on faith and on a commitment to excellence an on a commitment to each other. If you asked me what this team means to me I'll tell you it means one, dedication and two, family. Where people care about you. Not just cause you win or things go well but because they generally care. Being apart of this team means you know the standards and are willing to make the commitment. Last year they said this team would never win again. A while back we had a group of girls who wanted to win but didn't know how. Then we progressed to a point where we had a group of girls who wanted to win, knew how to win. Now we are at the point where we have a great group of girls who want to win and know how to win but don't always exhibit it. That's a thing of the past. We aren't going out there defending anything. We are going to fight for it, to compete for it. Nobody gives you anything in this world. People can give you money, they can give you wealth, and fame. But the one thing no body in this world can give you is respect. They can't give you the self respect you have for yourself, the way you run your race, the way you believe, and the way you do things. This is a sport of respect. You are the SJS track team. You are special. You represent all those who came before you and all those who are gonna come after you. Girls, this team has a spirit, the spirit is within all of us. Girls, all you gotta do is listen and believe in that spirit. And remember girls, today's the day we're gonna win.  **Yea, well, we got 4th.... but I was proud of us... we had a good run girls... and, well, Tech deserved it... one day we'll be strong again...**

      Today was a good day. I kinda had something on my mind for most of it but, I mean, it still is on my mind but I'm gonna push it aside till it becomes a bigger problem. School was good. I think I am really starting to like math. Maybe because I finally get it. I decided I'm gonna do Pre Cal next year and Mr. Leone talked me into taking Physics so, I mean I know for most those aren't too hard of classes but for me they are and I'm gonna take as many hard classes as I can. Notre Dame will be more impressed if I'm making decent grades in hard classes then awesome grades in easy classes, at least that's what I'm telling myself. I just got off the phone with Mickey. Things with him are good. He's comming out here on the 13th and then leaving the 16th. Two days, three nights, it all works out.  It's hard to beleive how far things have flown ya know? It's like, six months ago we were just like friends and now, it's like, we are so much more then that. Like, we aren't that couple that stays together cause of like sexual stuff cause I mean we can't do that stuff. We actually have an awesome like communication thing going on. And it's like, we're each others support system. Like, if he needs me, I'm there, and if I need him, hes like right there, and I mean yeah I have Deb and Erica and alla them, but it's like, I dunno. It's nice to have him there and caring you know? And what I really like about him is he doesn't sugar coat. He tells it like it is and he will get his point accross, but hes not arrogant, he does understand what your talking about. Okay enough about Mick. I know your all sick to death of hearing about him. Sorry. I hate imposing my happiness on people. But, the track meet Saturday should be an adventure. I'm going but I'm not running. It'll be nice to be there for the team. I'm just kinda anxious to get back out there. Today when I was watching the girls running, I SO badly wanted to too.  Tomorrow is Thursday. The week went so fast. Maybe cause I stayed home Monday. Next week should be interesting too. Deb and my birthday is WEDNESDAY! I can't believe we are gonna be 17 Deb. We have come a long way as friends too. It's amazing how everyone is changing and stuff. Like, I got an e-mail from Greg today apologizing and all that. I mean, he said I probably hate him but I been saying since day one that I wanted things between me and him to be cool, so I dunno what he's talkin about. Silly head. Sometimes I wish, ya know, that things could go back to the way they were before all these changes and crap and it's like, now that I think about it, I dont'. I mean, we all grow and change for the better or for the worse. It's like, what the message of J.K. Rowling is, only we can make our own choices, no one can choose for us. IT IS OUR CHOICES AND ACTIONS THAT SHOW WHO WE TRULY ARE, NOT OUR ABILITIES... And I dunno about alla yous but I think thats a pretty gosh darn important message.  Peace x0x

      Today was truly an awesome day. It all started when I woke up and blew out my hair and got all ready for school with my new teeth and all. Then I got to school and things were good ya know? Then, first period, Mss. Erardi told me she thinks I should do Pre Cal next year instead of Trig and that would be AWESOME!!!! I feel like I've amounted to something ya know? Like I'm never great shakes at school, especially math and now my teacher wants to reccomend me for something? AWESOME MAN!! Then, Mick tells me hes commin and the plans for Florida are like all set.. things are just great ya no? Yay for happiness. Peace x0x

      Okay, I kinda tweaked the template a bit. Well, a lot. I got a whole new one and I have spent the past like hour or so working on it. I wanted a links thing so I can link back to people who link to me (::coff:: writers revolution ::coff::). Plus Deb and Erica's Xanga's could be a good read as well. If anyone wants me to link to them then just tell me cause I'm too lazy to go around to all your Xanga/Blog things and do it. And the comments system is down... again. Dave if you could, can you e-mail me the code thingy for comments cause the comments site is on the fritz and it's not giving the code. Thanks a bunch. x0x

      Yes.... it has finally happend... THE BRACES ARE OFF!! And according to the Brits (Elliot and Euan) I look great!!! To show the world the new Lauren, here are  urlLink before and after  pictures. They need a bit of whitening but, they aren't half bad. I'm really happy with them. Plus, I got to miss school today and the whole Florida plans are set and Mick's plan for commin here are like looking really good. Lets just hope school goes well and my arm heals quick and I can run Manhattan College and then all of outdoors with out killing myself. That would be good. Very good. Okay.. thats that. Peace x0x!

      Well... yeah.. life has ALMOST hit rock bottom. Track: my season is shot. Well, I might not run for two weeks and then come back for Manhattan College.  We got 4th place at Islands and I have never been in so much pain durin a race. The 600 killed. My wrist was throbbing, my legs were locking, I couldn't breathe, and at the end of my race my head joined my wrist and started to pound. I got taken off the 400 cause I was like... just cramping up all over. I couldn't walk straight or see straight. So.. kinda a rough day for me, and the whole team for that matter. I'll post the speech I gave before the meet that I tweaked from a speech from a Lou Holtz locker room speech. People said it was good so, I'll post it later.  So.... yeah.... on a lighter note, I get my braces off tomorrow! I get to miss school and everything cause by the time I get done it'll be like 4th period and thats half the day gone so, whatever. It's all good, I mean, how much can I miss? Right? Well thats about it. Peace x0x

      Oh my God... I just watched South Park and wow.. it was HYSTERICAL... it was about Kyle going to see "The Passion" and like when he sees it he just like feels bad about being Jewish and having killed Jesus and Cartman like, starts up a group that's main goal is to kill Jews but the people that join think its a spiritual group and Kyle goes before the Synagog congregation sayin they should appologise for killing Jesus that way. And Stan and Kenny go see the movie and they hate it so they go to see Mel Gibson and ask for their money back and Mel is like a complete lunatic asking if they wanna torture him to take the money and its like only 18 dollars when he lives in this like beyond huge mansion and like they finally get away and he follows them back to South Park and everyone sees what a lunatic he is and... omg it's just so funny.... you all need to start watching it cause this is great stuff... then at the end they said all this stuff about how if you wanna be Catholic thats great but you should follow the teachings of Jesus and not be guilted into going to Church and stuff. It just makes so much sense!... but yeah... so.. just had to tell you how much I love South Park... ah... makes life worth living x0x

      So yeah... I'm dying. Well... maybe that's an overexaggeration... but, I'm sick. I was like coughing up mucus before it was kinda like gross cause it was like my nose was running out of my mouth... wow no one is eva gonna wanna kiss me again afta that one.... But yeah, I'm kinda jazzed up on NyQuil, if thats possible cause NyQuil is supposed to un-jazz a person but oh well.. my lifes one big oxymoron (and a regular moron too, just for the hell of it). This weekend wasn't too bad. Friday I went to see  The Ladykillers  with Fea and Melca. It wasn't too bad. Fea in all his racistness kept wishing the old back lady would just get shot already and Melca ate "Poppums", not sure which ones though, think they were Snickers. And GOD DAMIT MY DASHBOARD CD KEEPS SKIPPING!!!!!!!!!! Sorry... So yeah, more about my weekend. Saturday was our first outdoor meet which didn't go over too bad. I ran the first 100 I ever ran before in my life, and we didn't do too bad, 3rd in our heat I think. Our handoffs kicked ass. Then I went to the "Luau" at my school. I think that was like the WORST "luau" in the history of all "luau"'s. I mean really, if thats the way a "luau" is supposed to be then I will never go to another "luau" again...... EVER. I mean, besides playing outdated hip-hop the other musical choice was music that you should be on Acid to... then the auction was gay cause no one wanted to seem so desprit as to pay money to make someone hang out with them, then I didn't win the raffle so that just added to my mal content. Then on Sunday I went to the city with my mom and Joe. I think this was like the WORST Sunday in the history of all Sunday's. I mean really, if thats the way a Sudnay is supposed to be then I will never go to another Sunday again...... EVER... wait... well you know what I mean. But seriously, this was God's way at getting back at me for not going to church in months. Joe had asked me to look in his jacket pocket for the tickets to the show we were going to see (" Fame "... should be renamed " Gay Men Trying to Act Straight for the Viewing Pleasure of an Audience "). So I'm like, alright, so I put my hand in the pocket and I don't feel tickets but I do feel paper, so I took out what was in the pocket and lo and behold...  2  not  1   but  2  Trojan condoms [ waits a minute for this information to sink in ] I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF... JUST JUMP OUT OF THE CAR INTO ONGOING TRAFFIC AND THEN MUSTER UP ENOUGH STRENGTH TO THROW MY SELF IN FRONT OF A BUS Have I stressed enough how much I wanted to die? And then it got even better when they started to make sexual inuendos towards eachother I was like "Oh my GOD... earmuffs, earmuffs... GOD DAMIT WHY ISN'T IT WORKING!!!!!!!" So yeah, that was my weekend.... don't you just so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o want to be me? x0x

      Here's my trip in a nut shell... Friday: I got in and they picked me up, it was so good to see him.. so he had his party and I met the people I've been hearin about since day one. Michael and Ali and this girl Ashley and her b/f Joe were my favorite people... they were mad nice to me and I had been talkin to Ali for a while online so it was AWESOME to meet her in person, same w/ Michael. They were all mad funny, they would come up to me in groups and ask me to say "wart-a" and then when I said it they would laugh. It was kinda funny how big a kick they got outta it but... oh well they were all really nice. Then Me and Mick stayed up till like, 3, and the next day we didn't wake up till 1. Saturday: As I said we didn't wake up till 1 so the whole-day-in-Indianapolis thing was kinda put on hold. So we didn't leave his house till around 5:00 and we started walking around at around 5:30. We walked around the canal and he showed me the Arts Garden and "The Circle". Then we went out to dinner and then we went home and stayed up all night and lets fastforward here.... Sunday: we didn't sleep so I just got mt stuff together and then I had a minor breakdown and then I met his family. That was an adventure. They were all really really nice. They like had the BEST accents but I deff had one to them so its all good. The Micks mom broke out the baby footage of Mick and the embarassment commenced. It was so funny... I couldn't contain myself. Then the moment came to say goodbye... there were a few good omens when we were going into the air port, like, were you ever on your way somewhere and like you see something that just tells you its all gonna be gravy? Well, we did, and it was good. But, then when I had to say goodbye. It was tearful but then he called me to tell me the plane was canceled and we got to hang out for a bit more.  I was really depressed when I was on the plane, it was such a relief to sleep and to not have to think about anything. Then we landed and it hit me the trip was really over and I might not see him again till June, maybe May. x0x

       This post is about Thrusday   Today was a good day. It wasn't like bad but just like not bad ya know? Like, the best parts were deff with out a doubt 7th period and track. We watched some of Harry Potter en Espanol in Spanish class so that was good. Only thing about that was Mrs. Johnson called the Gringotts Goblins "trolls" and goblins and trolls are like 2 different species and it just kinda ticked me a little.  Another eh thing was my senior ring. I don't really love it all too much but it's nice. It would be even nicer if the damn thing fit my finger. It's too big for all of them, it doesn't even fit on my tumb or anything. But 7th period was deffinitly the highlight of my day. About 15 minutes before the bell rang Mr. T (Teffurie, not like the guy who goes "I pitty the fool" and "Jibba jabba") said that Msr was gonna make an announcement and we all should hear it. So, the big man gets on the PA and says "As you juniors know tomrrow is supposed to be your ring ceremony but we have decided to postpone that till Monday. Now, tomrrow is the feast of St. Joseph, our schools patron saint, and I think it would be nice to have the day off to honor him." and the lunch room went CRAZY... it like EXPLODED. It was great and Rob gave off this feminine scream that made even the gayest man go "That was good." Then, track was just a blast. Debra's whole thing sucks really really bad, and by the way good luck today Deb at the doctors call me with the detials. But, after our workout today there was a huge girls team snowball fight. It was so fun. I hate hearin about teams that all they do is think about running and never have any fun. I mean, I'm a serious runner and when I'm running im focused but after practice its nice to have a group snow ball fight. Then, I went to SAT class and came to the conclusion that I'm not going to college. Then, when I got home I started to pack for Indy which is about.. oh... 10 hours or so away. So, then around... oh I dunno 11ish, I get a call from John and he goes "I can see you." and I'm like, "No you can't." and he tells me to look out my window and, hark, there is Dave's car. So the boys came in for a big and we hung out. You have no idea I felt so loved that they came by to wish me a good trip. Even if they only came cause they were in the area, or cause they had nothing better to do, the fact that they stopped by was like really nice: Rob, John, Stasi, and Dave, you's rock my world.. never change. Well... I'm gonna go get my homework done cause it would be nice to like not have any when I get home cause I'm sure I sure as hell won't want to do it when I get home Sunday. x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x Pray that my flight goes by okay.

      Yes... it does  But, today was a good day. I went to the mall with Debra and Erica and got some things I needed for Indy. I got these capris and this cute shirt and some socks... socks?... yes, socks.... and just a few other little tidbits. I got this awesome like body powder that tastes like marshmellow and like 5 pairs of underwear in Aeropostale (thats spelled right, right?) which was cool. Gotta love good underwear deals.   Yeah... I'm mad excited about my trip out there. Ali told me she would be mad tired if it were her and I probably will be but I'll try get a 2nd wind... well by that time it might be a 3rd wind.  I'm just really worried about Debra. She needs to have surgery on her knee cause the stupid doctors had to wait till she had two tears in her ACL to realize something was wrong. I hate doctors. One says one thing, another says another thing, and then if you go to a third for a tie breaker you end up with zilch anyway.   School tomrrow... why?... because God hates us....  just kidding .   NEW SEASON OF SOUTH PARK TONIGHT! 9:30-10 YOU ALL BETTER WATCH!

      Al Sharpton is visiting a primary school and he visits one of the classes.  They are in the middle of a discussion related to words and their meanings. The teacher asks the Rev. Sharpton if he would like to lead the discussion of the word "tragedy."  So the illustrious leader asks the class for an example of a "tragedy."  One little boy stands up and offers: "If my best friend, who lives on a  farm, is  playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that would be a tragedy." "No," says the Great Al Sharpton," that would be an accident."  A little girl raises her hand: "If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy." "I'm afraid not," explains the exalted spiritual leader. "That's what we would call a great loss."  The room goes silent. No other children volunteer. Rev. Sharpton searches the room. "Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?"  Finally at the back of the room a small boy raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: "If a plane carrying the Rev. Sharpton were struck by a missile and blown to smithereens that would be a tragedy."  "Fantastic!" exclaims Sharpton, "That's right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?" "Well," says the boy, "because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either."

      This weekend was pretty good. Friday, I stayed home and watched "Uner the Tuscan Sun" which made me want to get divorced, move to Italy, have sex with an Italian guy or two and then, while getting two crazy teenage lovers together, find the love of my life. Then, Saturday I went to the Jersey Gardens mall with Debra, Danielle and Ambro looking for prom dresses. I tried on this big poofy yellow one that was really great, I like loved it. If it wasn't yellow it would be like my dream wedding dress. But, yeah, I ended up buying two sweatshirts and a button down pink shirt and a tank top. No dress. Got some good ideas though. Then, Saturday night I hung out at Vin Fea's with Don, Rubin, and Nick. I beat Fea at pool   twice   and Rubin once. It was fun. I love those guys. They're awesome. Today was alright. Nothing too much worth blogging.  New comments system which is cool. Use it. Love it. Cherish it. x0x

       Give me a break, give me a break...   Please.  So yeah, my Friday sucked. I know this says Saturday but it's like 12:45 so to me its still the Friday from hell. Last night (Thursday, for those not paying attention) Mick and I kind of touched on the subject of takin a little break but didn't really discuss it. The mere fact we brought it up was enough to make me sick. So, all day I was on the verge of tears, I bet I failed my Chem test, but hey what else is new. So, the rest of the day went through in a haze of reading something that always used to make me happy and wanting to jump out a window, or infront of a bus. Then, 2:45 came and my one break of the day came for a miraculous 5 minutes. I thought my mom would be able to come pick me up from school but no, she couldn't, so I was like "Well this is great. Now I have to walk home in the misty foggy gross weather. Awesome." And then, my saviours, Lauren and Steve saw me walkin and they gave me a ride home. But, like I said this lasted about 5 minutes. When I got home, I reailized I didn't have my keys. So, I was stuck outside my house in the cold and the mist and the fog for about 45 minutes. I must have cried the like whole time I was out there. Just all the stress from the day and then from my mom not being there was just too much and I just bawled.  Then, my mom got home and let me in and I decided to take a hot bath to warm up. I put some Dashboard on and I just like, I couldn't even take it. I got out and just sat there for like another 45 minutes listening to Dashboard and just sobbing. Then, my mom came home and I fell asleep for a while which was nice. I love not having to think. Just being able to sleep and shut down everything. It was lovely. Then, I started to talk to Mick when he got home from goin out to one of his games and about 3 hours later, the decision was made to go on a break. I'm sobbing now wiriting this. I mean, I know it's not a complete and final thing but... I dunno. Maybe when I go out there things will be different. I've decided I'm going out there wether he likes it or not. I begged a lot for my parents to get those non-refundable tickets to Indianapolis and I am going. I've come up with 2 game plans just in case I am not wanted at the Paskiewicz residence. 1) Sleep in the airport for 2 nights. Hey, I mean it's like free accomodations, got a roof ova my head, bathrooms, and food courts. 2) Get a cheap ass airport motel and attempt to get into the "Indy Action Area" for something to do and then just leave Sunday. It would deffinitly be an adventure and I'm all for one of those. Just me and my duffle bag... exploring America. Maybe, if I don't want to go to Indy, I can trade it in for a trip to Canada. Dave made me smile tonite when I was in my I-am-so-sick-of-this-mentaly-I-am-now-sick-of-it-physicly state. It's just I'm rarely so stressed and since I hardly get this stressed when I get too pent up with emotion I just make myself sick. I think what happened was I got too emotionaly involved which is another rareity with me. I am usually very detatched. It's not in my nature to cling. Maybe, if Mick and I are one of the lucky couples who benefit from a break I'll fix that. Yeah... sounds good to me.  And now for a Harry Potter quote that can be put to this situation:  "You all righ'?" he said gruffly. "Yeah," said Harry. "No, yeh're not," said Hagrid. "'Course yeh're not. But yeh will be." "No good sittin; worryin' abou' it," he said. "What's comin' will come, an' we'll meet it when it does."

      Well today was our renewal day when we go into school for a like retreat like thing. My group had the misfortune of watching the video they had in store for us frist. See the whoel day revolved around the theroy of Abortion being wrong, and while I agree it's wrong until today I felt it was the mothers choice wether to do it or not.  So any way, this priest started his sermon in the auditorium and like I found him kind of annoying cause he kapt comming back to the "innocent babies" thing. While it was true it was kind of annoying and he had us like say these psalms and readings outloud together and stuff. Then came the video. Okay this thing was very graphic. It started out with a person sticking a like metal thing up I guess the woman and just pulling out things. Then there were pictures of baby   parts  . The camera would show baby hands, heads, arms, legs, feet, there was one of half a head and the eye wide opened. Then there were some pictures of 9 month old babies just layin all crumpled up and dead. This went on for about... oh... 3-4 minutes. I wanted to kill myself and what hurt even more was that, that could have been me ya know? What if my birth mother had decided she didn't wanna go through with all this "pregnancy" crap and just have me aborted? I would never have met any of my friends, or met any of the people I have ever come in contact with. Now, I've had a pretty good life, and it's just so sad to think that all those babies, who could have had a great life like me, are now deprived of that because these women didn't wanna go through with it and didn't want to face the consequences of doin what they did to get pregnant in the first place.  Plus  these women got a lotta nerve getting rid of someone so cruely, someone who's apart of them, when great women like Sheila are tryin despritly, spending a lot of money just to have a baby. These poor kids would have been so much better off being adopted off to people like Sheila who are going through tedious Invitro prcedures when there are great kids just waiting to be appreciated and loved ya know? It was just a really sad thing to watch and to put us through. Not too many of the boys were too effected but a lotta the girls were cryin. I just had a look of disgust on my face, at some point or another my mouth dropped and it just stayed that way for a while. Then came confessions and that was uneventful, I don't think the priest even listened to me at all. Then this lady told us that its all of societies fault that abortion still happens and that if we don't do anything to stop it God is going to punish us. That was.... weird. Then the mass and then we all went to John's house where a lot of pizza-eating, pool-playing, and hanging-out went on and that was my day. It was alrite I guess. Hanging out with everyone was fun. Lot's of prom talk. I'm kinda phyced for it to tell the truth. Well thats it. x0x

      "Too many choices tear us apart." How true... how true.  Okay, we got our Senior Course choices today and frankly my mind is blown. Like.... I wish they had a creative wiriting class or something cause I mean the only class that really teaches you how to write is tied in with something I really don't want to do. Like, I'd take it for half a year and then I'd take something else and I relaly don't feel like doing that. Then there's Media which seems like it would be helpful cause I kinda wanna go into Journalism. I'm deffinitly doing Marketing and Finance and I wanted to do Web Design. I was gonna do Physics but I dunno, I'm a little shaky on that. I really don't want a science next year. I hate science. Ugga...   Decisions, decisions, decisions.  Tomorrow is Jr. Day of Renewal. Should be a truly holy experiance.

      I swear I have never seen so many Jamacians in my whole life. Penn was riddled with them cause a buncha them were running in the events. It was crazy. But yea Wednesday was cool we went out to dinner and were the like loudest there. We felt kinda bad for the hostess cause the 9 of us walked in and she told us to wait for 5 min for a table and so we just like all sat down in front of her and we were like the only people waiting so when the table was ready she goes "Joanne, party of 9." like there was a crowd of people in the restaurant waiting for a table and we, being arrogant New Yorkers, couldn't contain our selves and just laughed at her like, "Dude, we're right here." Dinner wasn't too bad, not grandmas pasta but it was okay. Thursday at the race was cool. I met Bill Cosby when I was waiting to do the 4x1. It was kinda cool cause it waslike, Bill Cosby lol. He shook my hand and like a stong wind came and knocked something down and he asked me if I did that and I said "Sorry. I just can't control myself sometimes." and he laughed and then like, it fell over again and some other girl asked him if he did that and he looked at me and said "Sorry. I just can't control myself sometimes." it was cool. That night we went to Bennagins and had "Kill Bill Night" in the 4x1 room. I love that movie.  Friday was okay, we watched the boys and then did our own thing. We went back to the hotel and did the most rigorus workout ever, which included like an hour in the hotel fitness center. Then we went to Ruby Tuesdays in this mall. At one point, this boy looked into the window by our tahle and when he noticed we could see him he like smiled and waved and walked away. Then him and his team walked in. They sent us over a note that started out "To the fine ladies at the window table..." They asked if they could walk around with us after dinner and we sent back a note sayin yes. After we ate we romped around K-Bee Toys and almost got thrown out cause we were hula-hooping in the store and playin basketball in the kiddie hoops. Then we met up with those kids. They were from Maryland and not all too interesting. Saturday we got to the meet at saw those kids and they were such pricks they didn't even say hello to us. We watched a bit of the meet, I bought some things for Mario. Then we left after puroosing through all the bootleg stands. I've never seen so many Jamacians in my life. We passed this one stand with all these like purfume oils and stuff and I saw this one called "Rear" and I asked the guy why anyone would wanna smell like ass. Then he gave us this one called "Lick Me All Over" which wasn't too bad. Then we smelt one called "Pussy"... yes... "Pussy" and God it was terrible. So I go "God, I hope it doesn't smell that bad."  The University City was really nice. I liked it. It was like a little village. There was one restaurant called "Penne"...get it.. Penn-e.... So over all the trip went well. I got really sick when I got home though, I wasn't allowed to go to the meet today and I'm not allowed to go to school tomrrow. Can't wait to see all the work I'm gonna have. Yi[[ie Skippy. x0x

      Okay so the big debate of the day, well not really debate, just something I feel like bloging about is the show Taxi. One of the characters on this old show from the.... oh... I dunno... 70's, says in an episode "Peel me like a grape so I can get out of here." Now, I don't know about you, but I mean, peeling a grape is hard. It's like, you gotta get the little thin outer layer and then you gotta like gently like pull it down and I mean the damn thing is so stubborn, like it knows its being peeled and it just goes "NO!" and then the outer layer breaks and you gotta destroy the thing just to get the whole peeling process going again. So yeah, tody was good. It was SO nice out it was like 80's and like really breezy and just so nice. It was great to run in just a sports bra again instead of the like 10 layers of shirts, 2 layers of pants (not including tights) and 3 pairs of socks. Just to be freEeEeEeEeEe. Yeah, then I came home and did my chores that I told myself I had to do. Like unpack from my dads, do laundry, and just get everything away for when my mom gets home. She's been in Florida and chances are shes relaxed from the trip and in a good mood and we want her to stay that way cause I still haven't told her about prom or post-prom or anything. By the way, Mick and I are back together. We talked things out, like we always do which is awesome, and now we are peachy. I like that word... "peachy"... sounds nice. I had a funny moment in the locker room today. We were all comparing our sunburns and Laura told me I looked pink and I said "I prefer Salmon, thanks." with like mock annoyance in my voice. We thought it was funny and SCREW YOU IF YOU DONT! Track News: I got thrown off the 4x4 for Penn, I'm runnin the 4x1 now. I mean, I understand why she did it but.... still.. dun mean I'm not upset about it. So yeah... things are good. I love this time of year. I've had my window open since like 4:30 and it's still really nice out and it's like 8:05. It's really nice cause the trees are startin to bloom so it's like yay! SPRING! and then, after that.... SUMMER!!! x0x

      Okay sorry, I went through a "fuck the blog" phase this weekend. So yeah, Thursday night was fun. Deb, Vin, Rubin and I went to the old abandoned Seaview hospital and poked around a bit. Rubin and Vin found a dead dog on a bed. Freaky. I would go back I think but only if there were more people with us, just us four wasn't enough. I felt like I was in one of those teenage horror movies that like your watchin and your just like "Look out beind you! Get out of there you sick loser! NO WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN!? Don't go into the abandond building!" but yea we went in anyways. Then Deb, Morgan, and Erica slept over and that was great. I love them so much. We watched Head Over Heals and then Grease. Two awesome movies, Grease is just great. Never gets old. Then, Friday I came to my dads. Nothing really happened on Friday except Mick and me deciding a break is the best thing for us right now. I dunno we just kinda been shitty with each other and frustrated and not at all in the best of moods. Everyone is sayin that we will be okay, and if we are meant to be then we will get back together, and that maybe a break is best and ya know, maybe it is. I mean, yeah I love the kid, and I don't want to loose him, but... I mean... what will be will be... life goes on. Then, Saturday was my meet. That was a catastrophy and a half. I was doin awesome for my 400, and at around the 250 mark Alyson spiked me, I stumbled and got off my toes and from then on I hadda put energy into gettin speed flat on my feet which is hard when you've been on your toes for a while. Fucked up my whole time. Saturday night, we went out to dinner with Aunt Donna, Uncle Bruno, Mario and we picked up Brooke cause I told her we would hang out. Dinner wasn't too bad, after Brooke and I rented School of Rock. That was a cute movie. Very well done. ::golf clap:: So yeah, that brings us to today. I got my prom dress. It's really nice and really like tight on top which is good cause my sad excuse for boobs need all the help they can get. It's baby pink and two peiced, it ties up the back and its kinda see threw so I'm gonna have to figure out what to do about that. Maybe I'll be REALLY daring and go commando........................... Or not. But yeah, then we went to this place called Junior Coture and it is my new favorite store cause it's just awesome. Has everything I like and more. I'm not completely forgetting about Abercrombie but.... this place gives it a run for its money thats for sure. Then I came home, packed up my things, finished my homework, asked Mick if he wanted to end this break now (last night he had asked me and I said after Penn, then this morning I woke up feeling stupid so I thought I might as well ask) to which he said "Nah, we can wait till after Penn." I dunno guys I'm kinda scared we just won't get back with each other you know? It's like... yeah lately things haven't been peachy but... I dunno.... things are just crazy... "Burn" by Usher has become our theme or something... it sucks... a lot. But, on a happier note... SCHOOL TOMORROW!!! x0x

      Today wasn't all too bad. I went to track a little late but hey better late then never.  Then I picked up Debra and we went to the mall. It was a good time. I looked at some capri's in Abercrombie but they were a lot of money so I just put them down. Then I went into Aeropostal all I found 2 bathingsuits I really liked but for one of them the bottoms were too small for my fat ass so I got this other one instead thats not as nice but decent. I also got a beach bag. I really wanted a Coach one but, for 18 dollars, this one wasn't too bad compared to the coach one which would have been like 180 dollars. Then we ate chicken and ran into Mike Wolfe who got a big hug and then we went home. I love driving, it's so nice. Like, I told Deb, "Dude, we don't have to wait for anyone, we can just go... don't have to wait outside, we can just go... don't have to meet up anywhere, we can just go." it's so nice. x0x

      Last night was terrible. The wake was one of the worst things I have ever been to in my whole life, and I didn't really even know the kid. What made it worse was that it was full of people who hate me. It was just so terrible. His face was just... God, you could see it... Then, I went to find Melanie and Erica and it turned out she was out back and when I found her she was standing near Greg. Morgan and I debated a minute or so wether or not I should go over there and we decided to go over and then Doof came up to me and told me not to cause he can't take it. Then, while I was looking for the car, I like totally broke down. Then, we finally found the car and it was so nice to be with my friends. I love the all so much. That whole night just really brought to light how much they mean to me. I wish I could carry them around with me all the time, especially when I leave next year. I don't ever want anything bad to happen to any of them. Then Morgan, Danielle, Erica and I met up with Cersha and Scabettie (sorry if I can't spell guys) and made them chase us for a little while. Then we went bowling. John, Rob, Rubin, and Dave met up with us at the alley and wow it was fun. Rob kept sayin to me that he was gonna blow up my car and I kept sayin not if I ran over him with it first. It was so fun... I love them... I don't know what I would do with out any of them. Debra, Erica, Melanie, Danielle, Melissa, Morgan, any of the trackies, the boys, Mick, the Canadians, the Vistana people... I just don't know what I'd do... I'd be lost... absolutley lost... Speaking of being lost... I left the alley at 10:30 and I started to get home. I got onto Hylan just fine and the road seemed to spilt at some point and of course I take the wrong way. So... I'm drivin and I end up on Bay Street in the projects. I was freaking out. So then I find Hylan again and this time I go the wrong way on it again and now I'm heading towards the bridge. Now I'm REALLY freaking out. After about 15 minutes I come accross Hylan again and so I'm at a light hysterical cause I'm lost and Mick and I are kinda inna tiff and this guy in the car next to me beeps the horn. So I roll down the window and he tells me my lights aren't on and I thank him and I asked him if I was going in the right direction if I wanna get to Barclay and he told me I was so I thanked him again and I went home. I like almost crashed five times cause I was cryin and I couldn't see straight. But I got home eventually... it was just a bad night except the bowling. That was the best. Talk to yous lata. x0x

      Track was fun except for the whole running part. We placed first in the DMR though my 2:59 800 wasn't much of a contribution, I should have just given my medal to Morgan or Jesee or Melissa, the ones who deserved it. Then the 400...but we don't like to talk about that. The ride home was fun. I got to drive there all by myself. My mom let me use the car. I drove her to the bus to the city and then I drove to New Dorp all alone. It was.... empowering I guess is the word. So then the meet ended and I told Debra, Doofy, and Jenn who had come to watc the race that I would give them rides home. It was an adventure in the least. First we had a little trouble finding Subway, but when we did and were on our way again.. oh man... Doffy's directions were abysmal (SAT word!) so I was like making hard turns and stuff then Deb, Jenn and I got kinda lost from his house. It was so funny. We had no idea where we were goin and I was like stopped at a stop sign for like 2 minutes and some lady beeped at me, then we were driving down a street and some guys in a car beeped at us and that just didn't help the fact that I was freaking out, convinced I'd like broken 10 driving laws or something. Then we put some Dashboard on and that made it all better. Tomorrow I'm takin Ambro and Nulty to the funeral for Lenny. We are gonna go durin the day. I know I don't have to but it's out of respect to all of my friends who knew him. Maybe afta we will all go out together cause it really brings the whole reality to you, ya know? Like, one night your chillin w/ your friends and the next your at one of their wakes. It's like, we really aren't gonna live forever, no matter how much we tell ourselves otherwize. x0x

      Yeah, I passed my road test. Though while I'm happy about it, it's kind of overshadowed cause this kid Lenny from Farrell died in a car accident last night. What's really sad is it's one of those accidents that shouldn't have happened. What scares me is that Melanie was supposed to be with them so thank God she wansn't. I dunno what I would do without her. It's just so sad... this is the second boy from Farrell thats died in a car accident in like a 2 month time period. Freshman year it was Luke and Diana from my school and now in Junior year two boys from another school. It's like, kids shouldn't have to deal with this, parents should not have to burry their children.... it's just sad. x0x

I like have the whole thing invisioned in my head like the dress I want a strappless one thats really tight on top and then like kinda semi poofs out at the bottom and my brides maids are gonna be in like a chiffon purple that like shimmers as they walk and like they will all have the same color but like a different dress design.. and like I want purple flowers of all different like types but all of them purple and I want to have the Rudy theme, like when the last football game of the season is being played and when he makes that great tackle, I want that to like be the wedding march, screw tradition lol.. I want to have it on a beach ya know and the reception to take place like under a tent with like little lights all over the place, some hanging and some around the top ya know?

I just did the science part and the english parts. Least there is only one math section but there is Trig on it I heard and I failed that test this semester... go figure.  Pray for me... but most of all pray for the cause... (Cause: Lauren getting into Notre Dame) x0x

      Some spring break, its gonna rain till like Thursday but what ever at least theres no school and maybe I can go do some summer shopping I need a new bathing suit or two. I wish I could have gone away some where this vacation. Stupid track and it ruleing my life. Stupid having to train for Penn. But, I'm happy to be going. But... yeah... so this vacation holds one major goal for me: to not say in every night like a total lozer. I seriously need to get out of this house and have some fun. I mean for months on in my world has been ruled by track and school and it's nice to be rid of at least one of them and I mean track is only in the morning so what ever with that ya know? So if you'r reading this and live in the Staten Island area just know Lauren is free just about every day for the next two weeks. TWO WEEKS!! AHHHHHH!!! NO SCHOOL FOR TWO FUCKIN WEEKS!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! That's awesome. And it's starting off with a real BANG and a half. Tonight I'm just gonna vist Debra for a little bit, see how he knee is coming along, should get home around 7. Then tonight, I have to study for the ACT tomorrow. Then, tomrrow after the ACT I'm going to go to Ms. Erardi's (soon to be Mrs. Iosue, I'm so NOT calling her that) wedding, the church part at least. I'm going to write her a really nice card and maybe she'll raise my average to like an 80. Then, Saturday night Erica and I are gonna babysit Mario and then Sunday I'm going to my dads for Palm Sunday. Monday I take my drivers ed test though so we will see how that goes. x0x

      Yeah, I'm leaving tomrrow for Indianapolis. For some reason I'm not all that excited. I think it's cause Mick and I have been fighting a whole lot and I'm just not happy these days. I don't hide it too well either, everyone's been askin me if I'm okay, do I feel sick, am I going to throw myself in front of a bus... you know, those same old questions. Yeah. I'm kinda bummed out I won't get to hang out with my friends this weekend, I mean four days is a long span of time and it would have been great to see them all with out track or something looming before us or anything. One good thing did happen today. Mr. Turner, my art teacher, said that he is going to get Mrs. Volpe to change my schedule around so next year I might be taking Advanced Art cause, and I quote, Mr. Turner said "I see some real potential for a great talent in you." Thank you Mr. Turner. I'm sorry for all the mean things I have ever said about you, your homosexuality, or your funny beard. He did make me feel happy with myself. I mean, I'd rather do art then Physics. ::Quiver:: Physics. What possesed me to write that down I'll never know. Not like I want to do anything in the science feild any ways.  So yeah, tonight promises to be a bad night. I really wanna go out and do something but everyone has a life that has no need for a Lauren in it. So I'll probably just do laundry, pack, and start my two essays that I have to do for history.  Canadians, if you read this, I should be on MSN toinght. Hope to catch yous on thea.  x0x

      That's what I'm calling this weekend, Prom Weekend, cause it started on Tursday and didn't end till Friday and then I hung out with mostly the same people on Saturday into early Sunday morning.  Okay, so Thursday I picked up Deb and we went tanning and then after I dropped her off I went to get my hair done and then redone cause I looked like Medusa. So then I get home and I relaxed for a bit, slept. Then I got ready and Fea (who looked very dapper by the way, all the guys did) picked me up around 5. We got to Ambro's and it was like a huge gathering of parents and teens in prom attire. I swear I felt so like super star cause all the parents had cameras and stuff and kept makin us take picture after picture, I swear I'm gonna have like 10 of the same picture on my camera. So then we climbed into our rolling Roman palace (no joke, the limo had 6 wheels, marble floors, Roman columns, and Roman statues in it) amd we to the prom. It was actually really fun. Danced with Fea a lot, hes not too bad a dancer. John was rippin up the floor, let me tell you. The best part of that was seein Mr. Boardman and Mrs. Gerdies dancin. It was great. I hope all our pictures come out. Don and his girlfriend were so cute by the way, they just looked so happy. So did Deb and Dave and Erica and Doofy. They just looked so great together, all happy and smiling. So after the prom we went back to Fea's house to change. I LOVED my after prom outfit even though Mick didn't like it too much (took pictures on my WebCam and sent them to him). I wore this like short pastel green skirt with this white halter top that had like a cherry pined to it with white high heels, I felt so girly and pretty, aside from my Medusa hair.  So the boat was an experiance. We saw these like black guys with all white suits and pimp hats and canes. The dancin was the best part. At one point me and danielle were dancing and this black kid was tryin to get inbetween us so we just kinda moved closer together and then Tom, Liz's boyfriend goes "That kid was staring at you two." and I was like I know. Then, a few minutes later he was back and kinda tryin to dance with me so I just kinda started to dance with this kid Tom brough, can't remember his name though. So yeah, then after that there was a comedy thing on the top deck with this black comic/ magician. Interesting mix huh? But yeah, he picked out John and kinda joked around with him for a bit and then he did a few more jokes but, he wasn't the greatest. Then he did this talent thing where he mad a white kid rap and then a white kid try n dance with a black girl. It was kinda demeaning but oh well, I guess they feel we deserve it.  After that it wasn't much fun. They served a ghetto Continental Breakfast and then we docked. People were gettin kinda fed up with each other cause now the drinks were being brought out. Stasi and Melca were pretty bad.  When we got back to Deb's we all changed and then they all really started to drink. Me and Fea didn't have anything and Rubin only had a little and I don't think Deb or Dave had too much or Danielle or Morgan but Erica and Stasi and Dave were bad. As soon as we got to Deb's and he changed, Dave just collapsed on the floor.  Then Vin and Erica started and she got really bad. Vin, John, and Rob were outside with Deb's brother and his friends so God knows how much they really had but I went outside cause I couldn't listen to Erica anymore. When Deb came to get me and told me to come back inside I found out Vin had thrown up all over himself and Erica was REALLY out of it. At one point after we put Erica in Debra's room, and Vin was on one of the couches I felt his head and it was warm so I put a cold towl on it and all of a sudden he gets green and looks like hes gonna puke. I put a bucket that was close by under his head and away he went. It was so gross. I yelled for Debra or Dave (her boyfriend not Melca) and Dave came by and took over and I went to check on Erica who was all upset she ruined Debra's prom. Later, when Vin was still kinda outta it, he kept tellin me he was sorry and that he dissappointed me and he won't do it again, but I guess he don't remember any of that cause I heard he said he has no regrets.  so yeah, then, when Vin was comatose and Erica was sleepin and things calmed down we made panckaes and I dunno just sitting around Debra's table eatin pancakes with my best friends I realized that, no matter what I say, I'm gonna miss them when I go away. Almost makes me not wanna go. I mean I realize at this point how special they are to me and how much I love them. I really could have spent every day of my life like that. Just all of us together, takin care of each other. I love them all so much.  The meet wasn't too bad. The best part of that was when we all sat down together to do a crossword puzzle. Yeah, Coach K did most of it but i got Sticky and Globes and Ella! Then that night I went to Fea's with John, Rob, Dave, and Rubin. They taught me how to play poker but then I think they regretted it cause I kept winning through Rubin's help. So, in the end we combined forces and split the money. I only put in one dollar but I got back three so yay for that.  And that was my weekend. Today I just have cleaning and homework to look forward to. x0x

      did you ever totally convince yourself that what you were doing was completly right and people arond you toally agreed and told you what was going on was for the best and what you needed and you agree and then everything just totally blows up in your face... when you are totally torn between two insane emotions and you dont know which is what and what is which and you just want all the chaos to end and for everything to be normal and for you and everyone around you to just stop and be happy and take a look at the bigger picture and stop for a minute to take a deeper loo and just realize that the little things aren't a big deal and to not sweat them and that in the long run the little things won't matter its the actions and stuff that really count? its just not fair. one minute things rea fine and your shopping for your post prom party outfit and then BA-BOOM all hell breaks loose. it's not fair.. i dont deserve this... ive been so good... so what im not perfect, im human, i make mistakes and i have to deal with them... but ive been so good.. ive been a lot more liberal then most would be in my situation and ive taken risks no one else would take and still i get rear ended. once you think things are over and they can't get anyworse they find a way of biting you in the ass. and it's like, ive been exposed to so many easier things that if i gave this up, plans could be made to make things so much easier but the thing is id rather it be hard and be the way it is then have things easy and then just be with out it. and pride and ego will keep me from doing this "who is this person to talk to me like that" "who are you to talk to me like that" all that fucking crap. its bull shit it really is. and yet we still dont give in because we will feel defeated and like the other person "won" this round and god forbid we loose a round in this crazy game. i just want this to end. i want this to end and i want to be happy. is that so much to ask? is it? x0x

      Well today I had no money and I hate being in the cafeteria around all that food when I won't have the chance of having any. So, here I am in the school library on the school computers. Today's been an okay day. I hate walking around, my legs are killing me from running. Thank God the seasons almost over. So yeah, I hope I don't get in trouble for this, never know how my school will take me blogging when I should be looking up chemystery or something. Today afer school I have so much to do. I have track then I'm going tanning and then I have to go to the mall and find an after prom outfit. Well I'm out. I think the bell is gonna ring soon. x0x

      Women are like apples on trees: the best ones are at the top of the tree.. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they just get the rotten apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy.... So the apples at the top think something is wrong with them.. when in reality, they're amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along - the one who's brave enough to climb all the way to the top of the tree

      Yeah the meet today was F'in awesome guys. Okay, started off the weekend kinda boring Friday night not doing much at all, at least I don't think I did much. No, wait, I went to the mall with Debra and Jenn and then at night I went to my aunt and uncles 25th wedding anniversery party which was a blast and a half. It was nice to see the whole family. I haven't seen Jenna, James, and Alec for the longest time so it was nice and no waves were made which meant smooth sailing. I didn't get back till about like 2 though so I was mad tired. Then, Saturday I took my senior pictures that I'm sure I blinked for every single one of them. My dad picked me up and took me to my cousins birthday party which was fun cause it was at an ice skating rink. Then back at my aunt and uncles house I took a 2 hour power nap and then I got home around... oh... 11. Track meet today which was like, awesome, besides the fact that we didn't get home early enough for me to go to the mall but like I said I went tanning so F the mall. Yeah so anyways, like I was saying, the track meet was good. We placed 4th in the 4x100 meter relay and then Alysen broke the school record by jumping 5'5. Jesse won the 400 and 800 meter, Morg ran the 1500, Christie ran the 3000, then Melissa, Carolin, Roquel, and Alysen won the 4x400 meter relay and then came my race! The 4x200!  I don't know what happened, all I know is that once Mari Rose gave me that stick, I just went. After the first 100 of it, I was like "Okay, doing this I should hit 29 if I keep it up." then I hear Melissa screaming "LAUREN SHE'S RIGHT ON YOUR TAIL!! MOVE LAUREN, MOVE!!!!!!!!!!" at the top her of lungs.  So now I'm freakin out like "OMG this girls gonna pass me and I'm gonna loose points... no can't let that happen" so I just like made myself go faster all the while straining my ears to see if that girl was about the pass me and then it was done and I was like "Yeah, deff 29, maybe 29.1 or 29 flat but I don't think it was anything spectacular."  Then Melissa comes up to me and goes "You are  insane  and I go, "Why?" and she goes " 27.9 " I was like WHAT!!!!!!! I was so happy I almost started to cry I was like jumpin up and down and laughin and like I said, I almost cried I was soooo happy. I was like finally thank God I'm starting to produce something from the nothing that I have been running lately. I mean, I've been trying to step it up and work harder but going into that race I was just not expecting that. And I mean to jump those two seconds it was crazy! Like I basicly said F you to 28 and Hello There to 27. The awesomeness was unbelieveable. Then I treated myself to an ice cream and a snow cone and a few sips of a Pepsi but then it made my tummy hurt so I stopped drinking it. So after the meet everyone was pretty happy cause we got thrid over all and thats VERY cool considering and Islands we got 4th. I went home and took Morgan and Melissa tanning. It wasn't too bad I like it. It makes you feel all warm. My ass felt a little hotter then I thought it should but o well. Who doesn't want a tanned ass? And that was my weekend. Yay for being happy and laughing again! x0x

      Well it was hot in the cafeteria as I wondered among the plethera of colleges that presented themselves at my school. I talked to a lot of them but I'm only really even considering like 1 or 2 of the schools I talked to. My thing is, if things don't work out with De Paul, La Salle doesmn't seem too bad. I won't get into Fordham but, La Salle I could do. And Pennsylvania is far away enough. Chicago would be better though. I'm kinda overwhelmed by all this college stuff actually. Like, there is just so much involved in the whole process ya know? Like, the SATs, the ACTs, the SAT II's, the application, the personal statement, the money, the deadlines, the teacher reccomendations... its just enough to turn your head ya know? But... yeah... today was my last CCD class. I really wanna teach next year but I don't think they are gonna let me. Some of the kids in my class said they wanted me to teach 5th grade (I'm in 4th this year) so they can have me as a teacher. Made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. x0x

      Yeah, it really really bites. So as soon as I get the chance which will probably be tihs weekend it's staying like this so just bear with me okay. By Monday I hope to have everything all spiffy again and looking good w/ links and stuff cause I really don't like this whole thing and the comments are gay cause as Shawn pointed out you have to be a member or some crap so yeah, imma fix it no worries.  Yeah I lost my glasses today. Don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. My mom said this place inthe mall can give me contacts tonight so I might have to go there a little later after dinner cause I am really blind. Adam Felinie (sp?) said hi to me and I basicly had to be nose to nose with him before I could tell who he was. Then they laughed at me. x0x

      Okay here I go.. I've waited long enough and now it's time. Okay WTF is up with the fuckin Harry Potter movies?!?!?!?!? Dude, seriously I can watch the movies and in each scene pick out at least 5 mistakes per scene. And I can watch the trailer for the new movie and in that ALONE I can pick out so many mistakes. Imagine, if the trailer is riddled with mistakes the movie is going to be drowing in them! How could they let this happen! How can JKR let this happen to her books! I just can't stand how Hollywoodified these movies are I hate it! I mean, the most basic mistake is their ages, but I mean that can't be helped. The second BIGGEST mistake is Harry's eyes are supposed to be GREEN and Daniel Radcliffes are BLUE... WTF!?!?!?!?!?! One of the main concepts of the books is that Harry share's Lily's eyes! That's supposed to be the main concept of one of the next few books and they are totally undermining it. They just don't seem to care that they are butchering the books. Another huge mistake is the clothing and the rewritten plot themselves. I mean, they are supposed to have thier own wizards fashion, not miggle clothes, I swear I have the same jacket that Hermione wears. And I mean WTF is up with the whole Harry totally all over Hermione thing in the pictures I've seen?? That NEVER happens in book 3. The most interaction they have together in book 3 is Hermione gripping his forarm cause she's a lil scared they aren't all over each other like friggin I don't even know. I mean really, plus the whole like thing about how wizards have their own culture and don't mix with muggle society (which includes clothing). I really can't stand how the movies are going. Also I hate these kids that see the movies and think they are the greatest thing with out even considering the books. I mean the books are cannon and the movies are just gay. They are good for what they are but they aren't the books. I mean, I can't tell you how mad I get when people ask me questions pertaining to the movies. I just tell them that they need to read the books cause the movies are shit compared to them.  I wish they never made them. I really do.  x0x

      Got my Act scores back. I did okay, came in the 71% with a 23. Not too shabby. That's enough to get me into De Paul and St. Mary's and a few others I been lookin at. None of them are Notre Dame but... I'm still applying to Notre Dame of course but, I know what the letter is going to say. I did really good on one of the sections though, Mechanics and Reasoning I think it's called. I got 17 out of 18 and got in the 99%. Math was atrocious and I didn't do as bad as I thought I was gonna do on Science. I'm happy with the 23, and for those who don't know, ACT's are out of 31 or 36 or something like that. So, 23 out of 36 aint too bad. I'm happy. I wanna do better but, I can deal with that. Other then that the day was uneventful... they changed the fries they serve in the cafeteria... bastards. x0x

      Yeah, the song sucks, well the remix by Jessican Simpson does at any rate. But... it would be nice. I want that feeling... ya know? Like we been watching "The Great Gatsby" in English and yeah the acting isn't too great but the love story between Daisy and Gatsby is like.. its awesome. Like, I'm rooting for the 100% even though I know how the book ends. I just can totally feel how Gatsby feels. He wants to re-create something that happened so long ago and it kills him cause he knows very deep down that it's not gonna happen. I dunno... I just really miss Mick I guess. Like, when we are together, it's like... its endless happiness. Like we can't get enough of just bein w/ eachother... we get so used to eachothers company and then we have to say goodbye and I tell myself to be strong... but I just get lonely without him here.... like, I can deal, which I have no choice about, but... theres that side that trues to be strong and not miss him as much as I do but then there is that other side that can't help but wish this was our house, our kitchen, our livingroom, our bedroom, our life... and I know being 17 that sounds realy gay and obsessive, but this isn't obsession, it's just me missing my boyfriend... mom doesn't exactly help either, "You should really look for someone out here." "There are plenty of guys on Staten Island if you just look." Yeah right, who is she to talk when her boyfriend lives in Brooklyn and her last boyfriends lived in Jersey. But yeah.. enough rambling.. sorry if I bored you x0x

      Today was Lisa's Funeral. It was so sad. I was okay for the most part but when Jennifer read her eulogy I cried really bad, especially when I heard Brooke cryin. It was really sad you guys. Like, she was just ripped from her family. Cancer is such a bitch. And like, her and Billy, her husband, they really loved eachother. Like you know the cupple that can't stand each other and are only together for the sake of their kids? Well Lisa and Billy were like the absolute opposide. They really loved each other. It's like.... they were that couple that were going to go the distance. They were going to make it. And then poor Brooke and Dean, loosin their mom. I mean Brooke's only 14 and Dean's only what, 10 or 9? I just don't want them to come out of this with any complexes or anything. Like some kids when a parent dies stop talkin and some just get angry or spiteful. I really can't see Brooke getting like that but, I don't know so much about Dean. He just seemed to be existing. Like, there was someone home but the lights weren't on. I just hope God blesses them. Rest in peace Lisa, I'm sorry I didn't know you better, but I'm totally glad I knew you in the frist place.  Staten Island Champs yesterday. It was a really good day for me, times were bad, but places were good. We came in 4th overall, Right behing Tottenville and Tech. We made finals in the 4x100 and then in the finals we came in 5th, then I was on the B team 4x400 cause my times have been really sucking lately and coach doesn't need me anymore, but we sunck in for 6th. I was so happy, we were in 7th place and I passed a girl from Tech. I was so happy you have no idea. I felt like I accomplished something even though my time was 68.9 But... oh well... I mean there are still more meets to go so, I'm confident I'll just bust out... well... I'm hoping I'll bust out... all I'm askin is to hit 66 at least once durin outdoors. That's all.  But yeah... yay for Mick cause he PRed today at his meet. x0x

       Awesome song...   Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved And she will be loved  Please don't try so hard to say goobye Please don't try so hard to say goobye  Yeah I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Try so hard to say goobye

I saw this kid every Saturday track, I've cheered him on... him and Roc... Christen said that just before he died, she was talkin to him sayin she was gonna marry him and she loved him and he was crying in his coma... God I just don't know what I would do if this happend to anyone I personally know... I mean, track brought me and Rob together and stuff ya no... but... if Erica or Debra, Danielle, Christen, Melissa, Morgan, Roc, Carolin, Jessie, Trish, Vin, Vin, John, Rob, Dave, Rubin, or any of the trackies, Mick, James, Shawn, Dave, Randy, Greg or anyone I know ever got hurt God I don't know what I would do with myself... and at the vigil tonight, we walked the course that Rob won frist place on and like.. every year we say we will run it better, every year we just expect to be on that course running and stuff and he'll never get the chance to get frist place again... he'll never run that course again, and poor Roc... his poor family... God.. just say a prayer for him.. many of them God Bless Rob Breen   Tomorrow isn't a given, it's a gift   x0x

      Yeah, sorry, I was in F the blog mode again.  SO... okay.. for some reason I have been having a string of very strange dreams. All occured in the Hamptons so I'm guessing that had something to do with it cause I hardly ever dream this silly. So yeah, dream number one, my dad becomes president and some way shape or form, Prince Harry, Williams younger brother, tells a tabloid he has a crush on me and wants to "pull" with me ("pull" is the British term for hook up, learned it last summer). So, he invites me to London to spend time with him and Mickey is all worried I'm gonna leave him for a prince, and I mean, who can blame him, and I don't remember if I do or not... well, if I did, I mean.. come on.. he's a prince. Dream number two was my dad telling me he got me a condo that was attacted to a Barns and Noble and when I asked him why I needed one he told me I could use it for college and I said "But dad, I'm going away to college what do I need a condo for?" and he told me "You can take it with you." I'm still trying to figure this one out.  So, I'm awiating part two of both dreams... maybe Harry will come live with me in my portable condo.  Took the Math B Regent today and, let me just say... at least we will all be in summer school together.  Chem is tomorrow so... least it's my last one. I'm gonna go to the mall after the exam probably so I can get some running shorts and stuff for ND. I can't beleive it's next week.  So, yeah.. what's been up with everyone lately? All those lucky bastards who don't have exams this week... tomorrow it'll be ALL over and that's a good thing. Florida is coming up pretty quick too... AH! I can't wait to see those guys. I hope Derrick can make it like he says he can. Me and Elliot are gonna have a blast, he's stayin in my room for a bit, and the Canadians are always a blast to hang out with.. I have fun talkin to those guys online on WebCam, it'll be great to be able to like see them see them. AH!! Less the 2 months!  I had a bold and daring moment today... enough said. x0x

      Tonight was good... I met Deb at the mall and then my mom and me did the car exchange and Deb and I went to ColdStone... God was in a good mood the day he created that wonderful place. Ah.. so yeah anyway, I had the Strawberry Shortcake Parade or Paradise or whatever. I mean, I was so torn between Birthday Cake Remix and Berry Berry Berry Good, and then Deb convinced me to try something new so I got the Strawberry thing. It was bliss in a cup. After that we kinda just drove up and down Hylan sharing ideas and stroies. I was told a rather funny one but don't worry deb I'll keep it on the LD.. I mean, DL... Low Down, Down Low... same difference. So yeah, Mick want's to talk about the break up... I don't know what there is to say.. part of me wants to take him back, and the other is tellin me that I need to be alone for a while... Why can't everything be like choosing which ice cream flavor I'm gonna get this time. I mean... Why can't every choice be between Birthday Cake Remix, Berry Berry Berry Good, and Strawberry Shortcake Parade or Paradise or whatever? That would be nice. x0x

      So, after all these long months... Mick and I are on a break. It wasn't easy and I'm a little worried about what's gonna happen to us, but I'm okay. He said he's fine and I dunno if he means it or not but... I just hope me and him can still talk. I mean... I'm worried but I know that if it's really meant to be then we will get back together and it will all be okay. I mean... college isn't far away and who knows? Maybe during collge if we go near each other, we will get back together. But I know I can't give him what he needs and I need to be happy again, cause I'm not and I you can't make anyone else happy unless your happy right? So... one last word.. I made onna my friends VERY angry the other night and into today and I'm sorry... I was a jerk... LULAS     See it's burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that don't mean I want to What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just I feel like this is coming to an end And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think   I can   change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it was through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn

      Well this weekend was fun so far. Jesse's party on Friday was a blast and a half fa sho and today I went to Fea's with Debra, Doofy, Dave, n Melca. It was fun. Frist, Deb and I lost, though narrowly, to Vin and Dave at pool. Then we went in the actuall pool for a bit. It was RELE cold and the boys were WAY too obsessed with the buckets and watering can. I tried to stay by the jets as much as possible but.. well... yeah, then after about 20 min in the pool it started to get rele cold and we got out and watched Kill Bill which is probably one of the most awesome movies I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Ate chips and cheetos like a beast, oh, popcorn too. That's what happens when you wake up at 4 in the afternoon and don't eat anything. I've like found so new old songs that I'm addicted to. "Cry" by Faith Hill, "Pretty Baby" Vanessa Carlton, "Leather and Lace" Stevie Nicks, "Your Song" Elton John, and a new song I love, "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now" by The Starting Line. Give uma listen. x0x

      It was fun. Lot's of dancing and cake eating. I mean, the two kinda go hand in hand huh? I'm really sad I'm not going to the BBQ or the Luke race but I think I'm going to go to say one of the Wagner Cancer thingy I'm not sure yet. Blah.. yeah... it's really late and I'm really tired but I don't want to go to sleep I want to go out and party or dance or something. Adrenaline is flowing for some reason. It's starting to simmer down now thought but still.. maybe if I read a bit.. that usually does the trick.  So yeah... Notre Dame and Florida is so close now. Like... I can't wait to see Mick and I can't wait to see the Vistana Crew again. What I find amazing is that I was so happy to be leaving and going tons of places this summer but I kinda wanna stay home now. I wanna stay and spend the summer with everyone. Ug... I still have finals. I was supposed to send the Religion Review to Gabby, I'll do it when I wake up. x0x

      Wow... this was it.. the last day of my junior year! It's crazy you have no idea. About 20 minutes ago I just went to the last 8th period of my hight school career (seniors only have 7 in my school). It's just like.. this all going by too fast. Heres an artical I wrote for the school paper and I'm really proud of, hpoe you all like it:  We never fully grasp just how fast time flies until we experiance it for ourselves. Many of us are laboring under the delusion that we are going to be young forever; that we are going to live forever and this reality that we live in called "high school" is going to be the most domiant aspect of our lives till the second coming of Christ. The real truth is that there is a whole other world out there waiting for us. There are so many other things beyond Staten Island to experiance. For the longest time I have been waiting for the moment when I can get on a plane and get out of here. To get off this island and see what else the world has to offer. I'm beginning to see just three years ago I walked into our school and thought to myself, "Wow, so this is high school." Now, itr seems like these past three years were so much more then just high school. It was lost elections, rumors, new friendships, broken friendships, stressful nights studying for tests, annoying teachers, annoying classmates, and college preparation. Three years ago I was worried about what sophomore year would bring, and now im worrying about what college I'm going to apply to next year. It's amazing. A few months ago, we drew up our senior schedules. A few weeks ago, we ordered our senior sweaters, and in September, the junior class will become the class of 2005. Little by little our senior year is coming closer, looming before us like some great pair of golden gates leading us to our futures. It is time for us to come out of our delusion. It is time to realize that youth, while still always inside us, is being rushed by time, tests, teachers, and parents. I am just now coming to terms with the fact that I only have one year left with the... interesting... and... diverse people that attend SJSHS. There is only one more year with each other till we all go away. Even if you aren't BEST friends with EVERYONE in the school, you've got to admit, it's a sad thing to have to say goodbye to the people you've spent every day with for the last four years. I know next year when I go away, I will miss all of you terribly, even if I don't KNOW all of you. Every student in the school - freshman, sophomore, junior, senior - is bround together by the force that is the name SJSHS. We are a huge family, though we are divided into our own little sections, and it's always hard to say goodbye to family. Excuse my emotional moment. Just a few closing words and that's it, I promise. Seniors, good luck out there. Juniors, let's make our last year together great.

      Yeah so I saw Harry Potter and the Prisioner of Azkaban and suffice it to say that it SUKED book wise. Movie wise it wasn't too bad. But... God they just butchered it. School is school. Got my bottom braces off so that's cool. I said a funny thing to Debra before, I told her "Imagine saying that you went to the dentist and saying you got your bottoms taken off?" It was funnier when I told her. I'm so worried about finals. My face is breaking out so bad, and I have to take senior picture retakes cause mine are SOOOOOOO bad. Like... really, really bad.... I can't wait for summer. I just want all these finals to be over and summer to start and to live on the beach. That would be good. That would be very good. Become a beach bum. I just wanna pass my Regents. Get them all over with. Ug... thats a good word to describe my mood... ug. x0x

       urlLink For Pictures, Click Here  Well the weekend was really good considering comming home was a pain in the ass. The plane was kinda cool, it was really small with only two rows of seats, one row had 2 seats and one row had one seat so I had my own and I liked it cause I had the window, the asle, and the middle seat all in one (for the low, low -one time- payment of $300!)! I kinda embarassed myself though cause I asked the flight attendent (who was male and named Sven... or at least that's what his name should be) for Root Beer and he said "Cold beer? How old are you?!" Really looud and everyone looked at me and I was like "No, Root Beer." and after all that trouble they didn't even have any. When I got off the plane Curt brought us to this Kosher (not Kersher) deli where Mick's family were because of this parade for the Indy 500. That was cool, met some new people, saw some old I'd met last time I was out there. It was nice to see his grandma, she's really cool, so are the aunts. So then we walked over to the Circle Center Mall (ug I think that's what it's called) and I foudn a jersey for the Pacer game the next night (more on that later). We hung out there for a bit and then went back to his house for a few hours... fast forward to dinner which was awesome. We went first to this German Beirgarten where they had loud music, drunks, and some of the best Root Beer I had ever tasted in my life. Then we walked the short distance (however in my high hells it felt like miles) to this awesome place. We ate outside and it was really nice (even though our candle kept burning out)... I had this awesome Chicken Marsala and then for desert we had this Creme Brule (sp? French students help me out) sampler thing that had raspberry, choclate, and vanilla Creme Brule it was really really good. Then we walked back to the Beirgarten and found Mick's parents and went home and lets fast fowrad again... Um... Sunday I woke up early but he woke up kinda late. We ate breakfast and Grandma stopped by. This apparently was a rare occurance but I'm sure glad she managed it cause she came bearing matching beach towels for Mick and Me of the American flag w/ a Statue of Liberty on it. She's awesome... Mick, if your reading this, your g-ma is awesome. So the game was an experiance. I bought myself a Regie Miller (#31) jersey and then we sat in some AWESOME 10th row seats right behind the Pistons (those bastards). The whole game was fun, I got on the big titon-tron thingy for a second behind some guy w/ a big afro of blue and yellow. But yeah, the Pacers lost and Mick wasn't too happy, I cheered him up thow... fast forward.... Um.. Monday... Monday... what did we do Monday... oh yeah.. Monday will have to be one big fast forward except for the basketball, the stargazing, and the movies "The Matrix: Reloaded" (only for about 20 minutes) and "Office Space"....  Monday night we were up really late and kinda camped out on the floor. At 7 he had to go to drivers ed so I got some sleep and then when he came home we were both out and then he didn't wake up till about 2:15 (my plane was leavin at 4:18). I had a good time trying to wake him up though. I kept throwin Hershey Kiss wrappers at him, it was fun.  So, as we waited for Curt and Gina to get home from where ever they were we ate some Tostitos with cheese and salsa. It was good. So we get to the airport and I thought I would be just getting to the gate on time and in my rusgh I almost didn't say bye to Curt and Gina. But when I got to the gate my plane was delayed, but not by much so I bought a salad and sat tight. Then it was delayed till 5:30 so I walked out of the gate area and met up with Mick. I got Curt and Gina, G-ma, and Mick's aunts some Gadiva's and then he got a pass to come back to the gate with me. It was then said that the plane wasn't gonna take off till about 6:30 and I called my dad and he said if it was delayed after 7 I could just get a flight the next day. But it wasn't delayed (why would it be?). I wanted to get the flight anyways cause I was freaking about the storms we would have to fly through but why would my dad understand that I didn't want to freak out when I was by myself. So, Mick and I had to say goodbye. The plane ride home was bad, I was sitting next to two pervy older men and I was just very uncomfy with the lightning comming from the clouds in the distance. So, now I'm home...  On the up side, I got my yearbook today. I can't beleive I'm an honorary senior. Crazy. x0x

      and with that, i start the LBI Weekend post. it was a blast! it was seriously one of the best vacations i have ever taken... just us, me, deb, andrew, jenn, fea, melka, rob, this new kid eric, and john... god... the fun-ness... okay, andrew picked me up and as soon as i get in the car deb goes "couldn't wait to get out of there huh?" i was like "hell yes." okay so we are in the car and made a few pit stops and i got a news paper cause i wanted to read about Martha Stewart and her misfortunes, and eventually we get to the cross words and word jumbles, it was at this point of the car ride where debra finally figures out the word "Rodeo" and decides to scream it at the top of her lungs, scaring andrew into the next lane. Good job deb.&nbsp;so yeah... we got a little turned around when we got there but we found the fea estate alright. we ate a little lunch and then headed to the beach where things were just lovely. the water was b-e-a-u-tiful, and not freezing like in the hamptons. i lost my bathingsuit once or twice but hey, it was all for the cause. i also wipped out on the boogie board a few times but dave was there to save me so yay!... i also almost killed feas uncle with a kadima paddle, that was fun... around 5:00 we headed to the bay where we were gonna go on the jet skies. that was fun. i went on with eric which was cool cause we hit a boat wave and like went 4 feet in the air, and then i went on with fea which was cool, and then i drove w/ Rob which was an experiance. we tipped over and that was wet.... that night was funny... we got all ready to go and went to this place called "The Chicken or the Egg" where they have famous spicy chicken wings... we all tried the ones that the boys ordered and omg, the hottest one was Ludacris and you know the food is going to be spicy when they tell you when you order that you wont be getting your money back if you dont eat what you order, and melka that anmial wolfed down 2 of them... lets just say my mouth was burning for a good 20 minutes.. and not even dull burning, full out, ouch my mouth is on fire burning... later that night around 11:30, 12ish we went on the beach and hung out.. that was really realxing... just sitting on the beach at night, listening to the waves break... heaven... so then the next day it rained for most of it but breakfast was cool, we all sat around the table and talked for a long while till we decided to go look around the town and stuff... that was cool... its such a nice place, long beach island. it stopped raining eventually and we headed to the beach again where we went in the water, which was beautiful with awesome surf... then that night we went to a sort of italian place and then mini golfing. i won a free soda at the end but i wanted free ice cream so ugg to that. we went back to the house and watched Dirty Work and i feel asleep for the beginning of The Water Boy when deb, attempting to take a picture of me sleeping fell over and hit something that woke me up lol... that night i dreamed a pleasent dream and then when i woke up realized it was just that... a dream.... and today, we hit the beach for a while, rompped around, tanned, and then it was time to go.. we went and did some shopping, got chocolate and fudge and got our plams read by Sally the Physic... she said that i would live long, have three kids, get into a good school, that i had a past life, and that i'm going to have a lot of fun in about 2 weeks... yay!... and that was that... the car ride home was okay, read a little bit of the Hemmingway book we needed to read for school so go me being all studious... lata... florida very soon!

      "You Had Me From Hello"  At the mirror you fix your hair and put your makeup on  You're insecure about what clothes to wear  I can't see nothing wrong   To me you look so beautiful when you can't make up your mind  It's half past eight, it's getting late  It's OK, take your time   Standing here my hands in my pockets  Like I have a thousand times  Thinking back it took one breath  One word to change my life   The first time I saw you it felt like coming home  If I never told you I just want you to know  You had me from hello   When we walk into a crowded room it's like we're all alone  Everybody tries to kidnap your attention  You just smile and steal the show   You come to me and take my hand  We start dancin' slow  You put your lips up to my ear and whisper way down low   From the first time I saw you it felt like coming home  If I never told you I just want you to know  You had me from hello   And when you're laying down beside me  I feel your heartbeat to remind me...   The first time I saw you it felt like coming home  If I never told you I just want you to know  You had me from hello

      So yeah... I'm home... heres the rundown of my "vacation"   Chicago:  this was fun.. when we got there we met up with Mick and his parents for dinner which was a lot of fun, always nice to see Curt and Gina, it was a good night even though Mickey wouldn't take me on the horsies. I went to see De Paul University and it was cool, i liked that it was in a city... chicago is awesome... I love it there.   Notre Dame Track Camp:  it was fun, i was always the last person to finish but.. hey.. its all good... the hall of fame was fun and seeing mick was awesome as always... my room mate was really great, Laura, shes from Fareport in Up-State New York and she runs the Manhattan Invitational too so when we have that meet i told her i'm probably gonna see her running past me cause she was really good... met a lot of nice people this year, it was cool cause we would all hang out together instead of little cliques.. it was nice. I went to this orientation for Notre Dame and I wanted to die the whole time, my dad looked like he was having a blast and a half but... I wanted to cry, it was torture, you have no idea.   Chicago Part 2:  very brief... only for one night, didn't do much.   The Hamptons:  It was great... Mick and I had a great time... we went to the beach, shopping, I got interviewed for a thing on CNN but they didn't use me... out to eat every night.. we saw Howard Stern, Kelly Rippa, and Candis Birdman.. we went boogie boarding, Mario and Mick became best friends.. it was great... being with Mick after we were havin all those problems was really good... it was great to be with him but it wasn't as hard as it used to be to say good bye... i missed him and still do miss him but i was okay when i got home i drowned my sorrows in a bag of pizza flovored Goldfish.  So now i'm home... i saw people yesterday, saw the girls at track and then hung out with deb and the boys... it was great i really missed all of them... today was pretty boring, i did nothing, had no one to do anything with... erica was away, deb was at the beach, melly was with greg... and im sure everyone else had things to do too... so yeah.. maybe tomrrow will be better. x0x

      well... i'm home... not that i didn't miss everyone, but, god i wish i was still there... if i were to do a rundown of every day and every funny word or phrase or how i felt about this and that it would take up so much space that blogger would just like burst... all i can say is the whole time i was away, i was in this sureal fantasy world... filled with laughing for 10 minutes straight, hugs, staring contests, scary movies, tears, more hugs, pools, hot tubs, ugly guys from Ohio who wanna drink all the time and have bad teeth, awesome accents, disney world, universal studios, risk lord of the rings style, james eating restaurants out of business, chicken, getting injured in some way shape or form just about every day, beating james at air hockey, james calling me fat (told you i would never live that down lol), elliots abysmal language around young childern, elliot stealing all the coke from the "tean jam", james and his indiana jones hat, pigs that walk n wiggle their noses, teddy bears, running around disney resorts, running to catch monorails, catching the last 30 seconds of the half hour fire work show, failing to cheat propperly at mini golf, more hugs, weird noises, james flexing his back muscles, not-cho-cheeze, and a few more tears.   i love those guys... god broke the mold... i been a mess all day and forcing myself to sleep so i won't have to think about how much i love and miss them... james thanks for the kind words, shawn thanks for having shoulders, elliot thanks for putting up with my long showers and not hiding other the covers every morning when i woke you up.  here's to the nights guys  x0x
