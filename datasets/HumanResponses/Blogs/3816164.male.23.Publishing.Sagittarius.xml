       Seriously, it was a dream. It probably wasn't even nantucket, but I'm going to tell you about my dream.  Ok, it starts out i'm going to a class, but it's sorta like a field trip in the sense that the class is on this island, and you have to take a ferry over. So first time out, I wait in this lobby, which was actually a piece from the Marriot where the Anime convention was, and then i get on the boat and I ride the ferry over to the island, then to the class. I start thinking that the island is Nantucket, but it's probably something in and or around Orange County, because the water is calm and warm.  I get to the class and it's pretty empty, just a few people in there, and even then, it's not really all that important. I mean it's a class and all, but it's nothing that's to great -- It's really just a minor bit actually.  Then after class i go to get some food or to check out the island and I come across some local resident, who just so happens to be the drill seargent from Full Metal Jacket. Though, in real-life dream he's actually a really nice guy. He's still got his voice, but it's never mean or angry sounding, just filled with... his sound. I like to think it's like you can hear his gums in his voice, the backs of his deep molars. I love voices like that, when you hear so much more of them beyond just their voice, you hear their throats, their nasals, it's just so much more lovely.  Anyway, somehow we get to talking. And i say somehow, because I never talk to anyone, but hey it's a dream, maybe i'm super-cool and a guy who talks to strangers in this world. So in talking, the seargent asks me in for lunch, which i say sure, and he lets me in his house which is... a house. All i remember is a small trailerhome-sized kitchen -- though this is merely for the size and layout, he totally has a full and regular wooden house -- and then he had a very large tiled bathroom, which i asked to use and then looked around a bit while i was there. I remember seeing a red box located in the open space underneath the sink and upon looking in the tackle-box or sewing box type apparatus, i found a lot of those little pipe-cleaner style tooth pick things. He had a buch of them, and being that they were all the type you actually use and reuse and wash to clean, i took one. I like having things to keep my teeth in good hygene -- versus my actually using and brushing my teeth often enough.  Upon emerging from the bathroom, the conversation keeps happy and the stolen tooth faded into obscurity. As did the conversation completely. Soon later i was walking around again but this time, i think i somehow got a place to stay. Like maybe the conversation with the seargent ended with me getting a rental to keep while i'd be going to the island. Next, i somehow get a kayak -- maybe i just take it because i always consider doing it --  and then i began kayaking to and from the island.  Next i end up going back to the ferry lobby, which now, while still the marriot, has a lounge or something that has seats set up like a DMV or more like an airport. Then as i'm comming and going into the lobby, i see an old highschool friend and crush Samantha Fox, i still a person who talks and yells out over crowds, catches Sam's attention, and she, suprised, comes over to say exuberant hellos. After the smilley few seconds of catch-up, somehow, i don't remember yet what i said, maybe it was something about how i had a crush on her (maybe i'll always think that about her -- a forever memory brand) she starts laughing, and then making that universal jerking-off motion, which i find odd, then another friend of hers starts doing it, and hell i think i even find myself doing it, almost as if its the cool new thing to do, we're ripping our hands up and down, laughing and smiling and having a grand old time. Luckily it's a dream and nothing makes sense... Then she goes away and maybe i begin kayaking back to the island. Somehow it becomes dark and the water gets kinda misty. I remember seeing a slow-moving cloud, and becomming very excited with it because the texture of the cloud was more geometrical than a cloud is, but thinking that the geometry meant something towards explaing clouds and maybe how they worked. Then as i get closer to the island, I start hearing and seeing fireworks through the fog, and then as i get closer, i start hearing the seargent grumble and shout at/towards the guy who's shooting off the fireworks. According to the seargent, he does it every night. EVERY night, much past the morotorium on fireworks, which he says is something like March 12th, but I feel like he mean't January first, But I think I really mean some time like now, after the Fourth and all, but still a little later, when some people still end up having a few fireworks left over -- but he totally meant March 12th. Of course, it doesn't matter. And so i get to shore, and carry the kayak on my back as i walk down the street to my rental, which i can't remember if its a shack or if its a tent. either way i'm excited to go there and to stay there. I find i really like the island, and i love that i get around by walking and kayaking. In this fantasy dream i am happy.

       Went over to eat some food at a friends nice house last night and we then went into their jaccuzi and pool.  In the pool Jenny, the homeowner, invited everyone to undertake a contest to see who could tread water the longest.  I was game. Out of the five of us there (MikeShannon, JennyDamian, and myself) Jenny and I were really the only ones to give the contest any merrit. As it went on i realize that the reason evveryone quickly bowed out was because of this: TREADING WATER IS FUCKING BORING. Nevertheless, Jenny and I kept at it. We were both determined to be the champion, no mater how long we had to tread water.  To try and psych her out, I decided to tread water at double-speed, whipping my arms and feet vigorously, making my torso rise higher out of the water in a show of physical dominance, which, wasn't too tiring, so it wasn't really a problem.  After about 15 long minutes we were still at it, me trying to move to fight monotony, and her just going steady. It was at about this time that I started questioning why i was still treading water while others were enjoying the hot tub again. The thought of victory came to me with a spirit I'm not sure i've ever felt before; for some reason the thought of beating Jenny at treading water sounded so wonderful and gave me a whole new strength regardless of how much my arms were starting to hurt (from the double-speeding) and how much my lungs were wanting my inhaler (Jenny has a bunch of cats that i'm allergic to, and i had a couplea cigarettes today), so i changed my form to include more floating, more dead-man floats, which required me to hold my breath. I think i tried all these things to slow my pounding heart and to relax my lungs, but the defeat was feeling imminent. That, in turn, made me want to keep going... Treading water, so pointless a competition, seemed like something I had to win regardless of the physical maladies that were beginning to overtake me. But then i thought for a second, Oh god, this was at Jenny's house, her home turf. And She'd finally called me back into her life, after a while of unresponded-to calls, taking her equal determination to fight this contest, would she possibly resent me for beating her so quickly into our reconnected relationship?  Taking this last chain of ideas as a big ole lifesaver, i reached up for the edge of the pool and let Jenny win. I was tired. She had the home court advantage. And I still had my old friend.  And factoring in reality. I always lose. Seriously, name one thing i've ever won in my life? .. Exactly. Nothing. Upon talk of my defeat in the hot tub, Damian said something about a competition to see who can quit the most, and I raised my eyebrow in possibility. I think i could win that...

       Yes, Pogzilla, while the light of my life, is really my second child. I didn't think THAT part of my life would come back to find me, but I heard a knock on my door this afternoon and lo and behold, there he was, "The Foolish People Parkway" standing in the doorway with a particularly blank expression on his face. Blank because nothing had been posted on it even still.  As much as i wanted to send the little rat bastard running for his mommy, I couldn't help myself. Maybe now that i've logged some actual fathering time with Pogzilla, maybe I can finally be a real dad to my first son, the Foolish People Parkway.  I've also figured out what i can do with the Foolish People Parkway. I've long since decided that Pogzilla would be my fictional outlet, writing up fiction and all things not-reality, well, maybe I'll actually use The foolish people parkway at http://krusteenation.blogspot.com/ to write about the world of my three-year-girlfriend breakup that seems to be all encompasing to me lately, but hardly something I really want to expose to the light of day. Sure I mention the link in the body of this paragraph, but no one follows a link unless it's underlined and glows, so I figure I'm safe. Besides. No one's reading this anyway, not even you. You're looking at porn right now.

       The kingdom of Futon, while vast and red and covered with a quilt, offers the imaginary lord ryan the quiet solitude he desires. Imaginary lord Ryan should in no way be compared to this author whose name happens to be ryan because the imaginary lord Ryan is, as his title suggests, imaginary. Equi-illusory is the kingdom of Futon, which, while bearing an uncanny relation to the author's futon, is actually (and by actually i mean ficticiously) a magical kingdom. In this kingdom, the imaginary lord would rather be ruling, and by ruling i mean to say, he'd rather be laying there doing nothing and continually doing that while complaining about the fan which blows over the kingdom, saying that it's too cold and then doing nothing about it until he falls asleep.  The benevolent reign that the Imaginary Lord Ryan exacts upon Futon is one of malaise these days and since the Royal Courier named Netflix will be gone for a day or two, busy procuring more stories to entertain his ruler, the Lord will most likely just mope until he falls asleep.  Totally ficticious.

       A lot of it is probably because i don't understand the language, but then again, they don't do all that bullshit of trying to talk from anchor to anchor, as if they're bestest buddies who're letting you see their human side as they laugh and joke and play from one story to the next. Fuck that. Chanel 18's Japanese News feed just has A pretty girl tell the news (sometimes though it's an older gal, or a metro-looking J-male) and then it jumps over to a par of anchors (one older man, other older gal). No bullshit inbetween cuts though, just straight, cold cuts: lots of times there's even that little bit of delay where they stop looking at the camera and look down or to the side to watch for their next cue.  Correspondents all tend to be in their Mid to late twenties, and while i guess being news, since i dont ever really get what they're doing, most times it's a happy-esque story or at least something where there excited about showing it to you. There's lots of food things like restaurants and food manufacturing.  Another aspect of the Japanese News that i think is better suited to making it more fun, is that with characters, versus Western Letters, they for some reason get to color them more. Like there's so much more emphasis on putting a nice bright red gradient or green or blue into the character itself, where, in america, Type tends to be either black or white and if you want to give it a greater visual, you put it in a box or something. I think the higher aesthetic focus of Asian writing makes this so, much more than western, where writing, as i see it, is much more of a means to an end versus an outlet for art. And lastly, the commercials. I don't know what it'd be like watching commercials on a Japanese station, but the ones they show every morning are a cute little cycle of cartoons and cute people smiling cutely saying or doing things cute to sell a cute product. As you can tell, i think it's all cute. Versus American commercials (on network television) which seem to focus a lot on drugs/pain medicine and or cereal or some other shit. I dont know, i just turn the channel. The cute J-mercials i can watch over and over again. Especially this one where there's this crowd of people chanting some product, and some guy with a prosthetic cyrano-style nose shouting at them. It's such a quick commerical that i don't know what the hell it's for but damn it, i'm going to find out soon!

       The worst part about uncovering a swarm of ants, isn't so much the ants crawling all over you, appearing quickly on every limb, your shirt, your shorts, everything around you, it's once you get passed that pacificity and stop caring about crushing each one of them weaving through your arm hair, get the ant spray and spray the shit out of everything around you, and sit back down only to be covered with the just as pesky and psychotic ghost ants! You think there are still ants a'crawlin, but they're all squashed and dead, no, they keep comming even in spirit! Bargh!

       There was a man who was wandering in the desert for 41 days. He saw jesus come and go, snorting to himself and calling the savior a panty-waist. As the savior went back into town, he turned to the wandering man and said, "yeah, no biggie, I coulda done more, but fourty's good enough for these people" and with that he waved while walking into a throng waiting on the edge of town.  The wandering man walked through the desert for another two days basking in his lack of food and lack of hunger. To him, it wasn't a big deal, he'd just gotten over it. Food was something he could easily ignore himself -- he had a strong will. Then he saw a camel drinking at an oasis, he laughed at the camel and watched it lap up the water from the hole in the ground so hungrily. Watching the camel drink, the wandering man grew thirsty and so, having no reason for not indulging himself, he drank water from the oasis, hands and knees on the sand next to the camel. It tasted good. When his thirst was satiated, he began to feel hungry, and as much as he didn't want to eat, the pit of hunger grew and grew, now that his body had remembered what it was like to taste and consume.  He looked at the camel, whose glassy eyes looked at nothing in particular, and he wondered should he kill and eat of the camel? The thought made him wince in distaste, but his growling stomach made him churn the thought over in his mind.  What would he gain by saving the camel? The camel would live and perhapse he would perish. The camel would go onto the next oasis and drink, or he would be reined in by someone who would feed it. Either way, merely by it living, it would need to consume more and more. He then thought to himself, "aren't I the same as the camel? I could die now and no longer consume or drain the world of its fruits, or i could continue being a consumer until i died naturally, taking in everything and moving on to the next oasis.  The choices he saw before him left him bemuddled. He thought over it for a long while, all the while disregarding the painful rumble in his bowels. The camel, had long since finished its refreshment and had promptly decided to sleep under a thatch of brush that sprang roots at the underground sistern as the hot desert day melted into cool star-filled night. With each passing moment, the pain in his stomach grew, and yet he couldn't decide if it was worth it to sacrifice the camel to quench his own selfish desire for life.  At dawn, the camel woke up and drank from the water once more before leaving the oasis and undetaking the desert heat once more. Nevertheless, the wandering man was still there, awake and still wondering what he should do. Conscious of all the camel was doing, and going to do, he continued to sit without action. Long after the camel had dissappeared over the farthest wave of the morning's mirage he held his pose, locked not on the thought of food, rather consciously on the pain of his hunger, the black hole in his stomach that yearned to be fed. "Why should i feed myself if i am only to grow hunger again?"  His strong physical will let him ponder that question for another 20 days when his strength gave out and he finally succumbed to the weakness of his body.  An unknown amount of time passed before anyone or anything else passed the desert oasis, and in that time, sandstorms and the bleaching sun had destroyed any evidence of his body. Years and decades later a christian would stop at the same oasis, watch a similar camel, with the same hungry thought on his mind, and when the moment of decision would come, it would be the unhoven foot prints of the man that would be seen leaving the oasis.

       I've had difficulty posting the latest edition, my manditory Anime Convention post. Hopefully this will follow it.  Problems probably arose when having the window open for like two days and then finally submitting it. Strange part was that the site saw it, but never published it. I, hopefully, have just remedied that.   Also just to throw out to the masses, I have a radio show on thursdays you should listen to it, if you'd like to be called friends I mean. It's thursday mornings from 6-8am. Early yes i know, but if you're a worker bee like me, 6-8 actually works well, I'd either be waking up or driving to work and if i could get it on the radio i'd listen. It's a soul and funk show, and yes, while being White, it has the slant of someone who either doesn't know what they're doing, or at least, is experimenting with some sort of genetic memory to my distant background as a plantation/slave owner, coupled with my anti-establishment 'fight the man' persona, it makes for an interesting bipolar show.  I think i'm kidding for most everything i just said.

       Yeah, unlike the title implies. Nothing super crazy happened at the con this year. But, i did get me a press pass which meant i got a free ticket. And while not officially being a member of the writing press, I'm validating the experience by writing about the experience here. This way, if someone tries to say, "hey ryan, you cheated Anime Expo out of a paid admission. Don't you feel bad?" i can easily respond "nope."  Although, even if i did nothing (which is pretty much what this will be) I still wouldn't feel bad because c'mon,  It's not like i snuck into a homeless shelter and ate up all their Thanksgiving Day gruel or something, that'd be pretty bad.  Friday. Start the day excited, excited to go to work or something. No, not work, that's not exciting. Oh wait, it must be the Con! Yea! Whoo-Hoo. Anime till the cows come home! All excitement is then castrated because of possible break-up situation on the girlfriend front. Nevertheless, I go and I park far away to avoid payment, find a street that doesn't shout "Rob Me" and hike to the Marriot, hike up the elevator shaft with a trusty elevator and arrive to room 414, my home for the next few days. Initially i thought i had the wrong place when I was greeted by a Woman who, well, didn't look like one of my friends. Turns out it was Zack's mom, and upon further review, looks like half of Zack.  Soon later Zack returns from some viewing, and i go off to get my press pass, knowing that it took Zack and Lydia something like 2 hours to go through registration. I hike back down the elevator shaft and negotiate the lobby carefully -- a wrong step means, well, a wrong step.  Unlike the long lines for normal people, the press sign in is downstairs. Which made the process slightly trickier, but if you were strong in mind and body, it wasn't too difficult. I don't recal stumbling, but it could have happened. Upon descent into the bowels of the hotel for the press sign in, I received my press badge and media kits.  When i finally got up stairs to the lobby, after that grueling ordeal, i decided to relax and take a moment to catch my breath and look through the media packet. I figured it was by far the most press-like activity i could be doing. The lobby was a perfect spot too. It gave me optimal vantage for scoping the scene, and it let other people see me and my press badge. No conversations or interviews transpired and upon finishing my perusal of the press packet, i packed my things together and went back up to the room.  Or no, that's not true at all. Lydia was finishing her auditions for Anime Idol while i looked through my packet, and i met her in the lobby afterwards, we got some martinis and had ourselves a nice chat over drinks and a duck spring roll appertizer. It was good. Then i think we all met at some point, and we watched Anime for a while, then had dinner at the hotel restaurant. I had a portobello burger that was tasty.  Lastly, we finished friday's anime portion by watching some late night anime, well the highlight for the night was Catsoup, a wonderfully psychadelic movie which i won't go into detail about, other than to say it was wonderful and you should all watch it. And i checked, Netflix has it so no one has an excuse.   Saturday. Breakfast of coffee and a slice of Zack's barbeque chicken pizza maybe. The day brought much more anime, from dawn till dusk, but the highlight was the Mechanical Propulsions Systems (MPS) forum. Basically the MPS is a group of nerds who want to make a mech-style human-ish robot. I think the concept is great. Sure they aren't backed by any major company or something, but according to them they have money to keep it going, so i say keep on trucking nerds, You go on and do your thing and one day, maybe you'll have your sweet revenge. Of course, in the end i don't think it will get you any real groupies, nevertheless the money you earn should be able to buy you some nice-looking whores. I also used my press privaledge on saturday by going into see Tokyo Godfathers, when it was already full. I waved my pass at them and they begrudgingly let me in under the guise of checking out the mammoth crowd. I was content to stand against the wall when some staff guy made me sit down. So it was the staff guy who made me sit, for the record, otherwise i'd have checked out the crowd and left (after the film was over). Also, we went into the dealer room at some point in the afternoon and found a booth selling Catsoup, so Zack bought it. I should have quickly also bought it, but didn't have enough cash at that point, so i had to decline. Only to find out later (Sunday) that the only other copy that was on the vendor floor was sold off and i was shit out of luck. In the evening, Cynthia came with alcohol and Kenny and Stephanie came down. Actually i guess they showed up during the day, but we went to dinner, most of us had the buffet, and afterwards Cynthia made drink concoctions for us. The drink was comprised of Vodka, apple something or other and butterscotch schnapps? Supposedly there was a fine line drawn in your opinion. If you valued something sweet you liked it, if you valued alchohol, you didn't. I thought it smelled too sweet and had a gross-ass aftertaste. Sorry Cynth.  Sunday.  Somewhere over the couse of this day i got really sick of Anime and was about to leave, but decided to stick it out merely for the journalistic experience and because what the hell else was i going to do for the weekend? The actual events of the day are blurred currently, but Boback came up for dinner and amid fireworks, we drove to a Thai restaurant and had some great food. The waitress reminded me of my Thai friend Pom's dad, but that was probably just the glasses, the round oh-so-thick glasses that i feel are so very Thai, unless they're on someone else then they're so-very-them. Also, my moping about the lost Catsoup prompted a more proactive search from my friend Lydia, her actually asking (how brazen) each vendor if they had any other copies. Long story short, no one did, but a local vendor said they'd bring a copy on monday.  Monday.  They did! I bought Catsoup for 21 Dollars. Also i got my mom a birthday present from the dealer hall. Basically it's a solar-powered super-big-headed smiley-faced thing that bob's its head with a smooth and subtle regularity. It hold business cards or name tags: perfect for a elementary school nurse says me. Like every day so far, they had more Anime playing. One thing that stood out was going to see their music video awards. Basically people took various shows and set them to music. Sometimes they were good, no, in fact, all were good, its just i haven't heard popular music in such a long time, that the experience was jarring. I only listened to the rock/action entries and they all sounded, well, the same. All were some version of those crappy hardcore bands they play on MTV, none of which challenge any of the conventions of their genre, but hey, I came for anime, not music so i'll let it go. After that there was one or two more anime shows to watch, but i ended up leaving soon after the second began because it was too depressing and slow, and i was just plain tired from the weekend. Plus I had my mom's birthday to go home to. So i bid my adieus and left the convention center for another year.

       Whether it was the physical wringer I and probably most AnEx folk went through, clearly, the long weekend has exacted its toll upon my immune system.  Currently, my left nostril is stuffed to capacity while my right nostril is free to whistle air in and out only with the slight possibility of flinging high-speed snot like a pitching machine.  My sinus feels thick and i can feel the pressure building. I hope, if the storm is imminent, that it chooses to fuck with me in a left-to-right manner and not the dreaded, full-frontal-sinus attack. Gum is helping me through some of this i think. The constant Chewing depressurizes my ear canals, which is handy for following up my nose-clearings.  Also i just feel poor. Sure i drank a lot last night, but that won't be what brought on the sickness, rather just something to make it easier for the sickness to beat me. Nevertheless, I have four scans which shouldn't take longer than a hour, but because of corruptions, might end up taking a fucking week. A week i'd much rather be asleep in bed.  We will bring you new information as it comes in. Stay tuned.

       The first feature of the 9000 models that is bound to catch the consumer's eye is the 25 inch stainless steel eye-gouging rods, which are heated to 100 degrees Celcius to melt the eye while penetrating. They are an improvement over the 8050 model which had a less-than-perfect guidance system that would send the eye-gouging rods into oral and nasal cavities instead of the preferred eye sockets. The nail-firing sternum-breaker is another new addition. Previous models used a bludgeoning technique to break the rib cage, whearas the 9000 shoots a barrage of 32 nails through a 3000 psi cannon. The result is shattering! But no Xerox machine would be complete with out our patented collating function, and the 9000 model killing machine is without exception. After eviscerating humans, the 9000 will neatly pile and sort through its kill so you can maintain your productive and efficient work.

       Since i have nothing but time on my hands at work currently, I've taken in this whole blog thing and have posted what, 8 times in a day? that's pathetic i know, but for some reason, everything takes on new meaning when you have a place to put it down.  Like this!  And this! And so on and so on. I need to make a pact. Right here, with just myself, not to do anything real. No life issues in the main space, maybe a liner comment here and there for context, but complete gibberish. Based on reality.   That said, i just realized i have some work i could be doing, though i was never asked to. Oh shit, that was reality. You know, i totally just lied to you, to myself. There's no work, those pages sitting right there, they don't need to be prepped, stripped, and placed, no. They need to be collated! And I'm not going to be the one to collate them! Collating is for machines. Killing Machines.

       I've given a lot of thought to what i should wear for the Anime Expo this weekend. I don't think i'll be wearing a traditional costume though, mine will have to be a little more introverted. Being that i'll be attaining a press pass for this weekened, I've decided that I'm actually going to dress up to play the role of a reporter who goes to the Anime Expo with some friends to do a story on what it's like to go to Anime Expo with a Press Pass with friends.  I can see it now, my unwritten sub head will probably say something like: While masses retreat into fantasy for the weekend, others retreat from self through copious amounts of anime. I figure since i have access to like the people behind this whole thing (actors, directors) i'm going to actually try to do a few pretend interviews. Talk to random people and make them feel as if they're important because a reporter is interested in what they have to say. Their words will not only perfume the weekend gala, but perhapse be placed in some catalogue of human interaction, some publication.

       Cool series. Sure, i saw the first two episodes last year,  but now i have the first disc, and a few more comming via netflix. Possibly the comming AnEx had something to do with it, but i think it was just a drive to watch more anime that wasn't just Bebop or Evangelion, which i've watched to death.  Bebop, while being just about perfect, is still just great, every time. Evangelion on the other hand gets better, the dept and connections make more sense. I smell an essay. How the fuck to write it though. No idea from me. One thing that caught me askew was one scene in the fourth episode, where the shot, while cell-by-cell art, had the handycam shake to it. It seems funny to me the idea that they'd mimic that with animation, but hey, if cinema went to lo-fi, maybe anime can. cept of course for the reality where a handycam sequence actually requires more work, more money and more equipment to get right. The h.c.s. (handycam shake), puts a more intimate perspective on the shot, bouncing from one character to the next, rocking slightly like on the ship. It creates a nicely personal moment. neato. Also to note, I really dig the Theme song. While I can listen to Bebop on a loop be cause it's jazz, i enjoy this one thoroughly as well -- though i might still just be consumed with trying to take in every spectacular frame. On the other hand, I have trouble wanting to listen to Eva's. More often than not, i turn the sound off and just read the captions. Even after a hundered or so viewings, i still can't recall the lyrics. Anime always does that.

       Once there was a pretty pretty princess, aptly named Pretty Pretty Princess. She was the fairest in all the land. One day she emerged from her beautiful castle of pink and opal glass, to see that a dragon had engulfed the country side. Slightly worried, she, elbow to her brow, sighed in both grief and woe. Moments later the prince, known throughout the Fairy Land as the fairest of all the land (whose father owns fleets of cruise ships, vacation time shares and spends his free time in philanthropical endeavors to build and maintain glorious libraries throughout the land so that all might be gifted with the power of knowledge), arrived to heed his lady's call.   The prince fought the dragon and it went on for days, all that could be heard were strange onomatopoeic noises like "pink!" "Cute!" and "Girly" as the Prince's gay blade (remember Zorro?) pierced and slashed the dragon into submission.   Soon later, all the land was safe. Hamsters and talking flowers joined in a chorus that filled the air with a song to anoint the Prince's marriage to the Princess.   They were happy until the end of the world. When the planet went baren and the globe shattered into black nothingness.

       See, now i'm just getting lame.   The Quest for the Rune of Blog Post....   One day a goat -- well a kid -- was out playing on a jungle gym. The weather was sunny, not a cloud in the sky. Then he was struck by a lightening bolt. As the goat's crispy body fell to the rubber mat under the jungle gym, the mix of smoke and steam that permeated from the carcass formed the shape of God--er, Pogzilla, Immortal Pica Pole and soverign king of infinity. The behemoth god then spoke to the jungle gym, " Gym, I need you to do something for me."  "Sure thing, Pog. You name it," quivered the Jungle Gym before the apparition. "I want you to run to the store for me. See, i'm making a pot of Beans, but the recepie calls for some Kale. I'd go myself, but I gotta watch the stove," the effervescent deity added. "Yeah that's no problem, not at all. Do you want the packaged Kale, or do you want me to go to the organic market and get the super-fresh stuff?" the activity aparatus asked of the god. "Hmm, you know, Since i'm making this as an appetizer...yeah, ya'know what, go get the organic stuff. I bet that'll have more flavor." Then the gasseous-incarnation of the mirthful Lord paused in relaxed contemplation, "Yeah, my infinite wisdom forsees a wonderful outcome. Remeber, to be nice to the Elepha-" On that unfinished opening of a pacadermal reference, the smoke and steam of the dead goat disapated forever closing the link between lowly Jungle Gym and most-exhaulted Pogzilla.  Then, as a gesture of supreme incomprehensible power and painful stoicism for the pain of man, Pogzilla unleased a rain of locusts -- a swarm of horrific bastard-devouring locusts -- upon all the great cities of yore.  Citizens cowered and became weeping balls of pity, holed up, huddled in churches and synagogues untill the torrents subsided.   Over aeons and aeons, ice-ages and dry spells, continuing to stand long after the rubber mat had long since deteriorated into a foul smelling dioxide, the Jungle Gym loomed, poised in its fasted position, the Running Manx, waiting for the geological status of the earth's mantle to deliver him towards the nearest Whole Foods Store.   Exposed to the elements as it was destined to be, the Jungle Gym's metal rungs then began to rust and tarnish. Soon (and by soon i mean one thousand years), the Jungle Gym was lost, reduced to a fine iron oxide powder that, on occation, would swirl around in the gusts of the barren war-torn world that had resulted from aeons of human strife. In one such gust, the Jungle Gym's powder happened to settle upon the sun-bleached bones of -- GASP! -- an elephant, and hidden between the cracks where marrowless mandible meets ancient tooth, lain the fossilized remnants of a cud of spinach. To the powdered Jungle Gym, it looked all the same, so it took hold of its find and shouted up into the empty heavens, "Here is your Kale my lord! Look upon my faded being in pity, for I have completed the task for which i was summoned!"   Upon the Jungle Gym's final umlaut, a crack of thunder erupted from the center of the earth and, the dry, now lifeless, mass of rock shattered into an unreplaceable corona visible only to the Moon, which was soon to be pelted with glass-like earth shards that would tear it asunder and would further drift into the asteroid belt that resides in space, farther back from where the earth and moon once were. In relation to the sun i mean.

       Photos be dammned!  Perhapse i will never go without having my visage perused by unknown masses of pre-screened blog-links. Hark! is that the sound of my sadness softly fluttering off into the infinitesimal blackness of a pretensious long-sentenced oblivion? Oh the foley of man in all hus dullness, the scourge of Computers in their oh-so-supreme logical truths!

       Shortly after Pogzilla was birthed from the heavens, at his first meal of leacherous villagers, and swilled his first drink of enchanted lake-water, he felt a tremendous rumbling in his bowels and felt the crushing need to relieve himself. It was at that wonderful moment that Pogzilla gave the gift of a dung-zilla to the earthen folk of Earth. Each dung-zilla being a cruel reminder to the awesome power of the great beast Pogzilla. Oh behold, oh behold and shutter with fear!   Or Don't.

       So I'm going on a drive up to Berkeley. Figure I haven't had food at the Oriental Restaurant in a while. No seriously. I'm going up to see friends. (Oh wait, just to point out, this entry is based on reality, sorry). Going up on friday hopefully early enough to catch a group of folk going to the beach Friday night. I was totally up to the task, thinking of it as a fun ride. I haven't made that drive solo in a really long time. 'Bout time i did it again i thought. Till I got a call from boback yesterday, telling him my plan. 'Wha? you're going to drive up... by YOURSELF?' as if the mere thought shook fear into his system. I brushed off the thought, saying "Meh, i do it all the time. In fact it'll be fun to go by myself, haven't done it in a while."  Then last night i started thinking about it. Oh god, what have i done. I've sentenced myself to 14 hours of voluntary solitary confinment! What the fuck was i thinking. I mean there's only so much comfort my cds should be able to offer. I mean i've listened to them all before! I'm bound to hit some snags and get bored. Fuck what was i thinking!  Next thought was to craigslist. Maybe i'd do a rideshare or something. Forego the monotony and talk to a perfect stranger! Hey, who know's maybe i could meet a cool girl, that could be fun. Then reality kicked in, or rather my ego, and I quickly decided against that. And then I went to bed kinda tired, but ultimately, being now girlfriendless, a little lonely. That got me thinking more. Shit, when the music gets boring i'm going to be forced to talk and think to myself. Horrible I know. Worse still is the old reality where on trips up, Boback and I'd listen to books on tape, we've learned to be killer negotiators, how to seduce with the power of the alpha-male and I'm sure we've learned some other things too, whatever they were. But alas, i don't have that capability since boback's already in berkeley! Grahgha! The Gods have forsaken me! Oh well, hopefully I'm blowing it all way out of proportion. I'll probably just pick up the cutest-looking hitchhiker i can find, until she pulls a gun on me and steals all my stuff.

       This is for bigstupidjerkface: I want you to watch full metal panic. I've finished the series and I can easily call it one of the best mecha anime's i've seen in a long time. Sure they approach the mecha from that gundam-esque military perspective, but it's not bad, and for the girls there's some romantic domestic quibbles in every episode too. There's tons of humor, it's drawn well, and -- the argumentative crux --  it does not test positive for Eva disease. Give it a look-see-do.
