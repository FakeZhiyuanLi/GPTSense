      Well its almost another day gone, to start the day off i had accounting, in which i was told to not answer any of the questions and that i could go on with other work as i pleased, (because i already knew this stuff, and my teacher wanted the others to answer some questions) but instead of doing anything else i sat there and just listened as he went back over the basics, and than i had physics in which we got our exam results back, i got approxiamately 53% but i was told not to worry as that was fairly good in Physics and basically to throw the old grade system out the window as it did not apply in physics. then let me see i had religion education in which i sat there bored as she spent the whole lesson checking if people had their assignments. then i had history in which i finished of my religion assignment which was due the period before instead of doing my history assignment. (its not due till friday so it has less priority) and than in Psychology i couldn't be bothered doing my work so i didn't and in english i was able to escape the evil wrath of my teacher because i didn't have my oral ready to do because as i claimed my chosen article was to big to fit on one overhead so that is how my day has been, yours any more exciting? from Piggy

      hey well its the end of another cold, wet, winters day, but hey we have got some rain haven't we? i suppose thats something to be thankful about. well as lots of you probably know (if you live in aus) that it was the lovely long weekend with the queens birthday supposely been today, wouldn't it be better to celebrate her birthday actually on her birthday? that means it would be acutally cemorative(is that the word?) because seriously, the queen has hardly anything to do with aus now, except we celebrate her birthday, yet its not even her birthday.. now think about that one!! well anyway after another cold wet boring day inside i think its time to go.. bye for now piggy

      hey did you know that Laurence Binyon wrote the poem 'For the Fallen' when he was actually at war fighting in 1914... the poem was actually published in an newspaper in semptember 1914 if you don't know what poem i'm talking about you might wanna read it below... you will probalbly know verse 4 the most!!!(just some interesting facts)  For the Fallen  With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns for her dead across the sea. Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit, Fallen in the cause of the free.  Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres. There is music in the midst of desolation And a glory that shines upon our tears.  They went with songs to the battle, they were young, Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted, They fell with their faces to the foe.  They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old; Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them.  They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; They sit no more at familiar tables at home; They have no lot in our labour of the day-time; They sleep beyond England's foam.  But where our desires are and our hopes profound, Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight, To the innermost heart of their own land they are known As the stars are known to the Night;  As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain, As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, To the end, to the end, they remain.  Laurence Binyon (1869-1943)

      So I have finished my exams... for now anyway and well what can i say, i am stuffed. i had six exams in three days and my little brain is overloaded and can no longer cope with this... now i just have to wait for the teachers to bother to correct them all.. its only year eleven so it probably doesn't  really matter but hey! right now i am meant to be working on my re assignment in which i am creating a powerpoint on the holocaust, it will have.. what a wonderful world (extended version) by louis armstrong playing along with it so it creates almost an contradiction but that is the effecto of it all... so anyway i am meant to be doing that right now but i cant be bothered because i am sooooo tired. if you haven't got a job its not worth it because you get to tired... but hey you get money so you can by shoes for the deb because your otherones were crap and you can buy Pjyamas that you don't want to get out of in the morning and go to school, and you can buy takeaway and than give half of it to your dad because your so hungry you haven't eaten since luchtime and its nine o'clock at night but by than you are past hungry and can't eat it... but hey its fun sometimes and than othertimes its not, anyway talking about food the bell has just gone for recess and i am hungry so i have to go eat my squashed lamington and squashed twisties because i am too lazy to put them in my lunch box and my heavy books squash my lunch.  Since i haven't written for so long i have decided to make this one extra long (just incase you were wondering) from Cassie
