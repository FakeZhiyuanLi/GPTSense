      I installed Picasa after coming through a news flash that Google had acquired Picasa & that it is free now. I had already seen the features but the fact that it was a triaware had put me down. So when I saw it is for free now, I couldn't resist. I must admit that it is a gem of a software for cataloging your digital images. I particularly like the Timelining thing......its just like browsing through your life history in pictures...if you have enough pictures taken through the years that is! Gives you that nostalgia kind of thing. Picasa is not meant to be a photo editing suite, there are other software for that. However, its got nifty features like Red-Eye reduction, Crop &amp; Enhance..... features that you will love and will do the most of the editing part if the picture is good in the first place.    One feature, however that I would have liked in Picasa is the ability to see slideshows  through  different albums at the same time.....could be based on timelines or sorted by name or album. That would be a great improvement. Presently you can only see slideshow of the selected album only. Folks at Picasa.....any plans for that in the future?    Another thing that needs a bit of improvement is the speed. It takes a while to catalog the pictures on the hard drive even if you select the specific folder(s) to search for (which is always a good idea). It took quite some time to catalog my about 150 meg of pictures on my decent spec'd laptop.    Then I installed Hello while just browsing through the features in Picasa. When looking at the icon 'Send Hello', I thought that it might be for sending to some friends or something (I never read the manual first....I'm the exploring type). That link prompted me to register and install Hello. I tell you ...the interface couldn't be simpler! Even a child can use it & what's most inportant is its fully functional. The lovely part is that it integrates nicely with BloggerBot - which gives the functionality topost pictures with your blogs online. Another registration for this, though. When you login to Hello for the first time you will see a message from BloggerBot telling you about the feature of sharing your pictures via Blogger. Oh, did I tell you that Hello uses secure HTTP to transfer/share pictures? Well, for the average person this means nothing, but to a security paranoid guy like me, its a welcome feature.    The best thing about this combination, which inspired me to post this blog is that the integration between Picasa, Hello and BloggerBot is really good and it comes in a very easy to use interface that is sure to impress anyone, even people who don't like sharing pictures (yes, there are lots of that kind as well!).     Bottomline.....give ot a try and you'll love it.    P.S. Make sure you have a high speed (at least 128kbps) Internet connection (512kbps &amp; above highly recommended).
