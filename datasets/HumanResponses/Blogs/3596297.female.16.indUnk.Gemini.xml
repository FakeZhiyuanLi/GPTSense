      Well, R.E wasn't thrilling, not that i was expecting it to be, on the upside Mr. Archer saved me from sitting pondering my thoughts for half an hour by letting me leave early. Wahoo My dads fiances here again, shes dutch

Bugger. Only one exam today.... R.E i revised a little yesterday but should hae done more seeing as i only got an 'E' in my mock.

       Stuck  Why won't it stop? The pain continues. We aren't each other anymore, Yet we find our way back, As if being forced unwillingly together. I wouldn't hurt you like that again, I never meant to in the first place. But it happened. What do you want from me now?  Why are we doing this? Neither of us want to, It's just that unstoppable energy, Pulling us back to each others lives. I won't leave until you leave but you won't leave until i do. Stuck. Stuck in this immortal reality.

      My life is so frustrating at the moment, i think i've successfully managed to ruin freindships with 3 different people on separate occasions completly unintentionally. Then im just getting more and more stressed knowing my sweet sixteenth birthday will be spent in the exam room, failing science and english... again! I could really do with some therapy right now. Grrrrrrr!!!!

      Well, here it is, my first post. Today I had an English GCSE in the morning. It would have been alright if I could have concentrated at all. But I was completly out of it. Even if i could have concentrated, english is one of my worst subjects, if there were no marks for coursework, i think i would have undoubtedly failed, luckily my original writing made my english teacher cry, oops. Well it's too late now, i'll just try harder next time.   Here's a poem i wrote a while ago   Fly Away   I fear my tears are only nocturnal, In the light they dread your view. I dream these feelings aren’t eternal, But how do I know it’s true?  To you, I guess this is all meaningless, It’s just another burden on your slate. You don’t understand the agony I’ve been caused, If you did, you’d help- but it’s too late.  I long to say there’s nothing I regret, However I’d be lying. My only regret was turning you away Your love I was denying.  Now I’m the one being denied this devotion. The emptiness never concludes, It’s always leering inside me, While I plead a change to this mood  I can’t accept this is the end, It shouldn’t have been this way. The loss I feel- it doesn’t cease. Goodbye, I’m gone, fly away  Its not great, but I have a few more maybe i'll post them tomorrow  Also today i was talking to my friend, he told me he once got a tampon stuck up his nose.... pleasant
