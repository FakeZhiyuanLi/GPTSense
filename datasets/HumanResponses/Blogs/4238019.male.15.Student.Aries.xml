      Realising that it is just 12 days to my 15th birthday, I am glad to know it. =) Time flies so fast everyday that you have to catch up with time. In school today, for PE lesson, we did the ACES Day workout at the hockey pitch as the hall was used up by the Seconday 4NA for their Prelims. The actions of the workout were so lame man... I remembered the last dance I did last time was "Let's get loud" by J.Lo . Yeah~ it was cool and funky. The exercise included "Where is the love" by Black Eye Peas. Ms Yeow did not come to school today again, so our class went outside the staff room to assemble. Quite a "bored" first half of the day. After recess, it was History. I felt relieved when there was no test. We did sourced based questions. During E Maths lesson, we have A Maths test. After the test, we had "conflicts" for the last question. We kept argueing for the last question to see who is right... hahahax.. get back the paper then see who correct la! Lol. Today got no homework.. so slack man. Ok, I'll stop here today...  Nothing much happening today. I'm off to watch EPL Highlights on ESPN.  Cyaz.. Good Bye!~

       Happie birthday to you, diary! You're 1 week old now. =P. Got my hair cut yesterday, betta looking now eh? hahahax. Manchester United 2-1 Norwich City! Yeah! Manchester United won!! Bellion's beautiful strike and Smith's superb volley made me proud of the 8th time English Premiership Champion team! I watched the match, and i enjoyed it. =P. This morning, I woke up and realised grandma was illed. Grandma, may God heal you with his love and faith for you and have speedy recovery too. I went to church this morning(as usual every Sunday =) ) and went to L2 Audiotrium as there was no Youth service. The worship was good and the Word by Pastor Rajkumar Ramchandran was great! I payed full attention to him, as the words he speaked made me so engrossed and focused during Word.Learnt quite a few things from church today too.   After service, I stayed back to play soccer wif my friends. My soccer skills improved and my accuracy was on target this afternoon. I was glad, of cos. After that, I went bowling wif Ben Thia and Dexter. First game, I won them. Yeah~ But second game, I managed second position :\. My top score today was only 114, where my highest score for bowling is 174. Off form today. After bowling, its arcade! My virtual striker skills improved and won Ben and Dex 6 times in a row, althought I lost to them quite a few rounds when starting.... =X. Went home after that. Finished doing Physics and Pure Geography homework. Slacking a while so that later can study of tommorrow's History test and A Maths Test. I'll stop here for now. Thank you guys and Good Nite.

      In 5,4,3,2,1... Start of diary for 21 August 2004 :- (Listening to PRESENCE) Hey everybody! Enjoyed myself today although the programm quite bored eh? First thing in the morning went to school for oral examination for Final Year Examinations. Felt relaxed when go to school, but facing Ms Png was a problem. I managed to say the Reading Aloud passage, but the picture was quite difficult. What a long wait for my turn man! No.10 candidate leh.. Wat the ****. Oops.. hehehe. Went to East Coast Park this afternoon with Krissy to book the bbq pit for my birthday leh..Yeah!.. The details are: Area C, BBQ pit no.8, 4th September 2004. I am inviting B-attitudes and Punked for the BBQ. Any of my schoolmates, or classmates who want to come, you're invited too. Just leave a msg on my hp: 91739619, or just come up to me to tell me abt it... Thanks! :P. After booking the bbq pit, went cycling with Krissy. Cycled to the jetty between area B &amp; C, and went to the pond to see turtles. =X. After that, I went home. On the bus, I saw Kellin. She was going to Hougang Swimming Complex... Long time never see her already... She was with her brother... Ok.. Now I am hoping that Manchester United would get a win tonite to catch out wif Arsenal and Chelsea. Go Man Utd! Cristiano Ronaldo is back at Old Trafford already, after the stupid Athen Olympics 2004 prevented him to play against Chelsea last week. Gabriel Heinze is still wif Argentina in Athens too. My prefered formation for Manchester United:- Howard,G.Neville,Keane,Silvestre,O'Shea,Ronaldo,Miller,Djemba-Djemba,Giggs,Smith,Scholes. My prediction is 2-0 to Manchester United. Go For it! Do me proud of you! Yeah!~.

Almost got "stress stroke". Tonnes of homework came to me and I felt so stressed that I did nothing in the end. So I did not touch my computer. Ok, enuff of the sorries... oops. (=X) j/k. I'll start today's diary today then. First thing in school, first period, Mr Yap was so mad of the class... He was being slandered online(dun tell which page =P). He said he loved the whole class and in return, the class hurt him emotionally. haix... poor Mr Yap. During Chemistry lesson, Mr Wong kept calling my name cause I was not paying attention at the back of the class. Sean Lee kept disturbing me and made me burst into laughter when he used the hose of water from the sink to spray Clarence and Xiu Juan(sry if I hurt u guys :X). Haix... I am a playful boy by nature, very hard to change. During Physics, we did the Refraction thingyy then got homework to do... *Sigh*. What a day for Mr Yap. I feel so sorry for him. As I was typing this bloggie, my morale became higher and better, can't wait for the day to come. If u dun noe wad I mean, its ok. hahaha.. I write till here, hopefully I'll write more at nite.

      Hie guys, good afternoon or good evening to those who are reading my bloggie now. I am back again in school after being MC-ed for a day yesterday. I love school, although I hate some boring lessons. But without school, will there be life? The answer is No. If there is no school, there will be no frens.(am i teaching a lesson or writing my diary of the day??) hahaa... ok. I'll start today's diary then. the first three periods of the day is Chinese. 2 hrs long man. Today is the Chinese "ying yong wen" test. For those who havent take the test and taking it tommorrow, it is lucky that u read frm my webby. hehehe. There are two questions, choose one(obviously -.-). First question, write a letter to the principal to inform him about staying school in the evening to study. Second question, write a letter to your friend to explain that there are many misunderstandings between your friend and you, and write to apologise to him. Ok. All the best to the Chinese students taking the "ying yong wen" test tommorrow. At the same time, I got back the Chinese test paper today. I got 29/100 overall for Chinese ( cool huh? pro rite? ) haha.. Today Ms Mel nvr come, so got 4 periods of free time. In addition, I got back my A &amp; E Maths test paper too(Pentitium 1 lag, my classmates got theirs yesterday and I just got mine today). I got 8/10 for A Maths( heard that I was the highest, hey hey :X) and 9/10 for E Maths. During recess, I reminded myself not to eat chicken or anything spicy, as instructed by the doctor. In the end, I ate fishball noodles and a few packets of seaweed. The venue of classrooms had changed last Thursday that Pure Geography classroom and Social Studies classroom have been moved into the two aircon rooms on the 3rd level, beside the boys toilet. Yeah! Nothing much taught in school today, had fun. But quite alot of homework to do. *Sigh* Tommorrow is also English Comprehension Test for CA2. Make sure 3e3 do their best so that they'll pass and do well for English. Ok, today's sEaN's bloggie will end here. Be sure to come here tommorrow to read more of my bloggie.. Thank you. :P

      hiee everyone! Today, I did not go to school as I was sick. I went to see the doctor yesterday and got an MC to signify today, 17 August 2004, Sean Chew is unfit for school. This morning, my temperature shot up to 38.5 degree celcius. My whole body was so hot that it could even boil a kettle of water... -.- ( Water boils at 100 degree celcius ) ... haha! i took the fever medicine prescribed by the doctor and about 20 mins later, my temperature calmed down to 36.8 degree celcius. Thank God! My mother suggested that I should go to the Chinese physican to consult him. Being an obedient child(ty :X), i obeyed her advice. I went down frm kovan mrt station to outram park mrt station, and took a cab down to Jalan Bukit Merah. The clinic was near the ABC market. I recommend u guys, if u're sick, go there to consult the chinese physican. I got 2 packets of chinese herbs to drink, which is very bitter. Yucks! But there's no choice, I had to gulped down the boiled chinese herbs boiled by my grandmother. NowI am feeling better and hopefully, I should go back to school tommorrow once again. =) Hope today not much homework too. I'll end of here then. Maybe I'll write more later. =D

      What a day is it for me. Firstly, Chelsea won Manchester United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge during midnight. That was a heart breaking incident for all Manchester United Fans, and for me, I was upset too. In school, during PE, the boys played soccer on the hockey pitch, and I was enjoying myself! :D After that, I drank lots of water to hydrate myself. I went to refill my water bottle and drank the water from the bottle filled with water from the water cooler. After drinking, and a few hours later, I felt very uncomfortable. I felt my stomach weighting a few tonnes that I think I felt sick. Maybe I slept too late last nite, and I have got headache too. So later I am going to see the doctor at around 6.30pm. Pray for me to get well too, if you're hardworking :D~. Dear Lord, pls heal me in the powerful name of Jesus that I will have speedy recovery, Thank You Lord for all this I pray in Jesus name, Amen. :). Today is Xiu Juan's b'dae, aka Xi Gua. I hope the Presence CD gift would touch her heart and make the right decision. :). Ok, I think I'll end off here and I wish everyone the best for their studies. Goodbye! (Check in here tml for more sEaN- bloggy) =D
