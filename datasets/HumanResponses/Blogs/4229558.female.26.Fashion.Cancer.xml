      So anyway, I didn't mean to just post and run the other day and I know I've left many of my dear readers on the edge of their seats about who eddie lee is and why I would run from him. I actually wasn't running from him I just didn't want to talk to him because he is a kid I went to school with and generally I fear talking to people I went to school with. I don't like to know what they are doing and I don't like them to know what I'm doing. The worst part of it all was that my blood sugar got really really low while I was at the library on monday so I was sat here for about 20 minutes trying to think of something to write until I realized I couldn't think because I was dying. DYING!!! And then there was eddie lee and I just had to get out of there fast. Actually, that's not the worst part of it. The worst part of it was that I wasn't even sure if it was eddie lee. Eddie Lee's dad was Wah Lee. He owned the only chinese restaurant in Yreka and eddie was the only chinese kid at my school except for his brother. I've known this kid since I was about 4 years old and to tell the truth, I'm not even sure if it was him or not. I'm a horrible racist. But I'm pretty sure it was him. But then again, he didn't seem to recognize me so either it wasn't him or all white people look the same to him. Although I doubt that, he would have been really confused growing up in Yreka. So maybe it wasn't him. The only thing that makes me wonder about the whole thing is what was he doing at the library in medford??? Using a computer??? His dad was pretty well off, wouldn't he have his own computer? I mean, they had a huge huge house on a hill in yreka. With a driving range or something If I remember correctly. Huh.  I'm going to Disney World in 19 days.  I need to get my own computer after that.  And Cable.

      On a diabetes side note, my mom's cousin ted jones came on an impromptu visit today, I've only met him once before and that was about a year ago.  He is diabetic but wasn't taking any of his medications because "insulin made him feel weird" and the other medications didn't work anymore.  Long story stumpy, he had to have his left foot amputated in may.  What a dope.  He said I could go ahead a say "I told you so" and rub it in because I was right to tell him he was an idiot for not taking any of his meds.  If I had the foresight I would have taken a picture on my mom's digital camera to post here but this blogging hasn't quite taken over my psyche to that degree yet.  If I had taken a picture It might have looked like  urlLink this   or like  urlLink this .  My dad had a bunch of stump/amputee/"not a leg to stand on" jokes that were in very bad taste and weren't that funny so I won't repeat them here because there's nothing I like less than bad jokes in bad taste.

              So this is my second day on this thingy and I totally forgot my username and couldn't log in.  How stupid is that?  Pretty stupid.  I just wanted to mention, if anyone didn't know, amazon.com has free downloads.  Not a million  great ones but I just burned a disc with 60 minutes of really good songs I didn't own before.  The playlist is as follows:         1. brainwarner "elliot smith's guitar" 2. loudon wainwright "dump the dog" 3.modest mouse "worms vs. birds" 4.elliot smith "between the bars" 5. yo la tengo "the summer" 6. loudon wainwright "the grammy song" 7. woody guthrie "do-re-me" 8. stephen malkmus "jenny & the ess-dog" 9. sleater-kinney "all hands on the bad one" 10. billy bragg "st. monday" 11. mates of state "ha ha" 12. stephen malkmus "the hook" 13. martha wainwright "lolita" 14. loudon wainwright "career moves" 15. modest mouse "dirty fingernails" 16. daniel johnston "tears stupid tears" 17. loudon wainwright "one man guy" 18. stephen malkmus "do not feed the oyster" 19. badly drawn boy - "the shining"           Heretofore I had never heard of brainwarner or mates of state.  both of those bands have other downloads that I likes but didn't get because I wanted to make sure I got all the stuff that I really needed.  I was especially excited about martha wainwright's song because I am a colossal fan of her father's and almost as big a fan of her brothers.  Now I just need to get some of the mcgarrigle sisters, rufus and martha's mother and aunt's canadian folksy duo.  I heard that loudon has a sister with a couple albums as well but I think that might be taking things a little to far.   My brother really really wants me to start a band with him.  We have a name, the Mount Butcher Hillbilly Boys.  Here is a picture of mount butcher hill just beyond miner street directly behind that street light.  Magestic, isn't it?             Speaking of the talent family, I just bought david sedaris' new book.  The stories seem short but I've only read the first few.  It  doesn't seem to be as funny as me talk pretty one day or that other one but he is always funny.    Does anyone in the world like daniel johnston as much as I do?

        So here I am in Yreka at mommy and daddy's house.  I decided to go ahead and take marigolds advice and only 2 1/2 hours after taking that dumb inkblot test and then going through all the rigamarole to get this blog I am actually posting something only to realize that I really don't have much to say.  I think I'll use this as a means to document some of the diabetes stuff I've been going through recently so if anybody who may come across this to read it finds it depressing you can just go screw yourselves because I think it will be a healthy outlet for me.  I recently went to see an endocrinologist for the first time in my life which in the endocrin system related auto-immune disorder undeground is like not seeing an oncologist if you are diagnosed with cancer.  Its kinda weird.  But there wasn't one in yreka and there wasn't one in eureka and when I lived in palo alto I only had insurance for like 2 months out of the three months I was there and didn't even see a doctor.  I hate doctors.  So I had sort of a panic attack there which I don't think I've had before.  I guess maybe I have but this was a very well documented one since the nurse kept asking me if I was okay when my pulse and blood pressure shot through the roof after the first 10 minutes I was there.  Alls I know is I freaked out.  Anyway, it went really well, I am doing really well, diabetically speaking, and things are looking up in the long run which is usually a good thing unless you have already resigned yourself to a life time of self pity.  It sort of put a wrench in that spoke so to speak.  He said that since after almost a decade of having diabetes I have no signs of any complications I am probably in a very small percentage of type 1 diabetics, about 10 percent, who are lucky bastards and don't develop problems for a long long time.  The luck of the fucking irish, irony and all.  The next thing I wright will not be so diabetes-centric, I promise.  Or so serious.  But this is the most major thing in my life recently.  I'll probably work my way back in time a bit to get some of you who I haven't talked to in a long time up on my comings and goings and what nots.
