      Had a very seriuos talk with Vanessa tonight, which was different b/c we have n ever acually had a seriuos talk before.  I she frustrated because she couldnt talk/see Joann or Jon, so i tried my best to cheer her up.  like Ive said i dont like to see her sad, so whenever she tells me she is i try and make her laugh.  Anyway I think i helped a little bit so that makes me happy.  After that we went back to what we usually talk about which is just goofy stuff, It was a nice talk before and if she ever needs anyone to talk ive told her multiple times she can always come to me.  Anywho Im off to listen to my "depressing' music as some would call it.  Have a good night all.  P.S. Vanessa I do believe you and I wont bring it up again, sorry for being wierd about it, I just have had a ton going on lately

      Well talkin to Tim last I founf out i was right.  Its finally good to get the real reason why we broke up.  Also i found out she told him what she was goning to do before he left for camp; im not really sursrised at that to tell you the truth just another thing it seems im the last to know about.  He said something about everyone not like her if she tells or something, i cant quite remember what he said about it.  Im willing to be friends, but its her move now she has to be at least honest with me, she doesnt have to tell me whats going on w/ her, but i would expect the truth from a friend.  Well thats all i have for now, i cant wait for my trip to denever so i can see how my uncle, cousin and her baby are doing.  P.S. Almost forgot.... Dawn like i said before sorry to hear about you and ryan keep your head up and just spend as much w/ each other as you can

I found my uncle Kevin, who rocks, is going to the hospital, and his daughter(my cousin) body is ready to have the baby now however the baby isnt due to till mid aug.... so slight problem there.  This week just seems to be getting worse w/ the break up on Monday, dont know what's going on with my friend, and then finding out about my Uncle and cousin today.  Im glad tomorrow is monday(did i just say that?) so maybe tomorrow will be the start of a good week.  Heres to hoping.. Cheers mates.

      Been talking tonight and let me tell you it felt good.  I found out a bunch of stuff, and i feel tons better.  i thought vanessa cared about me, but i dont think she did... and theres really only 1 reason why you give the its not you its me speech and thats b/c you found another guy/girl you like some im wondering who this mystery person is... i have a hunch though. So that whole im not ready for a long term realtionship was a lie. o well time will tell who this mystery person is.

      I never get told the truth, i hear onething from one person and something completely opposite from another.  Im always the last one to find crap out too, its sucks. Theres only a few people who are honest w/ me and thats aaron,, dave, jon for the most part, jax sometimes.  Like tonight i found several things which Ive been told something completely different beforehand.  First the thing with Jax, and then the thing with Vanessa.  Im pretty sure i know why we broke no matter what she says ive heard it from several people now.  I don't think she ever liked me..... and would explain WHY she never tells me anything, why she seems to be taking the whole situation much better than me, and also why shes able to move on so fast like last night and holding hands with someone during dodgeball.... thats how it started with me and her... I have only been honest with her from the start... so much for the "not ready for a long term relationship" she just didnt want to be with me I just wish people would quit lying to me!  I can handle the truth lies only make things worse! ARG!!! It seems like Im the only person who acually cares about other people feelings and not just themselves sometimes. My rant is done for the night, later all.    P.S. I know this is prolly gonna upset some people. Sorry if I did, just speaking what I feel.  If im wrong let me know and enlighten me   = )

      Last night i went over to Luiz's house for his surprise Birthday/ Going away party.  I thought i was starting to get over the whole thing with Vanessa but I'm not close at all.  I went to go pick her up and as soon as I got there all of these memories and feelings came rushing back, it sucked big time.  I wish things were diffrent like us still being together or getting back together, but i know she doesnt want that, so i don't want to think about its just hard not to.  Even though she says it had nothing to do with me I still think I did something, o well.  I'm all torn up inside, i cared about her sooo much and what hurts the most is she didnt feel the sameway at all.  I wish i could just flip a switch and be over with it.  I would never do anything she didnt want to or anything that hurt her. Life is just so hard sometimes it seems.  After watching dodgeball i put on my happy face, even though i felt worse than before.  The song im listening ALOT lately is Smile Empty Soul's "With This  Knife", its just what happened to me, and what i have to do.  I need to get rid of the love i have for Vanessa and go back to being friends.  I know we only dated for a month, but everything just felt so right. Im not sure what love is or feels like but she rocked my world, so i dont know if thats close or not but i did and still do care about her a ton.

Lets see sent the night at Jaxxie's house several times and just chilled with him. The Ders came into town so Jono hasn't been able to do anything so pretty much just been chilling at my house for the most part. Thommys B-day was on Thur so went out to Red Robin and tonight he's havin some friends spend the night.

        LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy. PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it. You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!

      Well helped out at the Fremont days yesterday w/ Dave, Amber and Vanessa.  I gotta clean out glasses ooo how much fun that was. Rodeo was cool to see but my neck was bothering me for the whole thing mostly, vanessa made it feel better for a while, but it started up again later. There was the dance thingy and all they played was country music = (  i dont like country music at all.  Thing we went to the downtown stage to see the band that was playing there but they were done when we got there.  I got a palm reading that was fun.  She said Im honest with everyone but others arent honest with me(strange i think that a lot) and that people talk behind my back a lot but i should ignore them.  She said im very smart but i need to study more(which i never do), That i should listen to what my family says they dont want anything bad to happen to me.  Im going to be a father early and get married whne im 19, andhave 2 kids a boy and a girl.  Ill be married once to my soulmate and im suppose to meet her in a year.  Shes going to a rich girl and im going to make good money and have my own bussiness and house,  how cool is that?  Spent the night at Jons house with Dann, vanessa kept calling and could have gotten Jon in a good amount of trouble if she had woken up his parents when she called his house.  After i hung up on her for the 3rd time we lwft jons went to my house and picked up some stuff and then we went to Hy-Vee and bought 5 12 packs of pop and then went back to jons house and cooked pizza and watched "The Butterfly Effect".  Well thats all for now Later Mates!
