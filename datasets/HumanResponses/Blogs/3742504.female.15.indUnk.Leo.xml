						   well now.. after not being able to sleep i find myself in a like 3 hour long deep conversation with teal. it made me feel refreshed, and i may add i performed some pretty spiffy psychology to prove my points. and now shes left to clear her head. and im sitting here. staring at the collage i made on my wall next to my computer. man im gonna miss this room when i leave high school. its my pride and joy and all the memories that have ever mattered are in here, all my secrets and all my dreams. its gonna suck. but you know whats making me the saddest? knowing that every second i sit here and every minute i spend looking at my past all im doing is wasting more memories.. ok granted it IS 3 o'clock in the morning.. it still feels like a waste of time ya know? it makes me think about the choices i make. about the things i hold in. if i only have so much time then why cant i tell people how i feel about them? how come were all so scared to admit our true feelings? if were not supposed to waste any time then how do we follow all the social rules, or worry about what people think? shouldnt we all just say what we think. i guess its just evolution, and evolution puzzles me. but you know what puzzles me the most? why the hell do i insist on doing all my thinking in the middle of the god damn night.

						   well if you cant tell by the title, i cant sleep. i didnt do anything today, and it felt good, first day of the summer to myself, i woke up at like 11, talked online, got on the phone with teal and lauren, went back to bed, lauren came over and we listened to backstreet boys.. because it felt going going back to when we were younger.. then we went with veronica to dairy queen.. yummy. i watched summerland:) ee favorite show EVER. learned 2 new songs and now im sitting here trying to sleep but always getting back up.   "dont look back.. its been too long since iv felt this way." that explains how i feel, great. and BOSTON kicks your butt. and thats a good song.  Lee

						   well tonight was a pretty good night. i went to laurens and james and randy and anthony went with us. it was pretty cool. seeing people i havent seen, james taught me about guns. its cool theyre fascinating. besides that we just hung around. the guys snuck into the gun range and got bullet shells. i just watched. but i got to keep one :). james is going out with nicole. thats very cute. then i came home and finally got to talk to ben. if you ever read this i would never lie to you purposly and im gonna end with that because im tired bitches, so good night.  on a happier note, i get to go to ocean shores THIS WEEKEND.  "Hopefully you’ll forget, Any words that I put in print. My luck, you’ll change, Have strength enough to walk away." god i know that lyric is everywhere in here but i love it. and it completely fits this entry.  Lee~

						   yah. i actually put a song for a title. hmm.. thats not like me. but then again i dont feel like me. i havent talked to any of the people that i usually talk to all the time for like three days. i think this is one of those times when you trying to avoid all the shit youve buried yourself in, and you just cant admit it. well at least i can admit it.  i wanna go somewhere, and never come back. i wanna run away from my problems. and thats not me AT ALL so once again, i think im going insane, im also listening to new rock. which i dont do very often. and i heard dashboard confessional on the radio. why do people like that stuff. it sucks, they have no talent, NONE. now BOSTON they have talent. if anyone whnts to buy me there cd for my birthday that would be wonderful(i only have thier album on record). (my birthdays august 10th) hah. your gonna be buying alot of presents around that time. because thats also close to a few other cool cats birthdays.... and if your cool you know who those people are. ok well since i havent talked to alot of you in a while, i went ice skating, it was cool i guess i just didnt know anyone really, but its all good. it got me outta the house. and then taylor came over saturday morning. on friday i got in a jet ski crash and got a scar on my head. me and taylor watched silence of the lambs. i almost crapped my pants. she just left a little while ago, and now im writing and i think im going end this and get online so i dont feel like im running away from my problems.  ... dont worry im not a complainer, but im listening to this GOD DAMN DEPPRESING music. how can people do this all day....  .. ah. its pink floyd, i think im happier ALREADY..

						   ok.. well when i first made this someone (i think it was lauren) told me i should put some of the stuff ive wrote in it.. and im really scared because i really dont let many people read them.  But if i want to be a better musician i have to take criticism so please read these and give me any feedback.. good or bad.         Perfection  Oh, how he is designed with such a perfection, He is not pure nor washed, With flaws of unhuman liberties, With hands of gold and eyes of silver, The creator of all that was unholy, Deliriously simple and reverance, With a polar mind and a tender heart, Just as the red eyed dove, Hes rabid as humanitys imperfections, He is the most ethereal of all autumns.           Jaime  See jaime's talking, dreams rollin off his lips, smiles to a greek tragedy as he turns his hips, jaime screams as the clock gives one more toll, "un-die my heart, unlift my soul!" Rose is one more flower blooming in his heart, while all of his lies her thorns impart, please, oh please world remove this curse, this is only so horrid because ive never seen worse, and jaime deteriorates as humanity unfurls she will always be his seed pearl.   yeah..those are 2 that i wrote recently.. i hope there not too bad.  P.S. NO i dont know anyone name jaime its a name i use to fill because it goes with the song.   P.S.S. Dont ask who i like either because the forst one isnt about ANYONE its about the perfect guy.. (that doesent happen to exist:()  Lee~

						   hey.. when auna told me to make one of these i thought id get mad at it and forget it but its actually pretty cool.. it feels like it gives me power. maybe thats wierd but it does.  today was umm.. eventful.  i woke up at laurens and we ate and then auna spent like 4 hours on the phone talking to people trying to get them to go to the movies, we eneded up only getting like a couple people.. well 4 besides us 4... then we came to my house.  this week has been enlightening, and that sounds cheesy.  but it has.  i told someone something that took alot of guilt that ive been holding away. and the truth is i was proud of myself for telling them. but of course with every proud moment theres consequences. and they thought i had bad intentions. of course i didnt, and i know that, and i guess thats all that matters really.. but it still upsets me that friends i thought i had think i would do certain things that completely ARENT me. i guess my friends dont know me as well as i thought. besides that i realized alot of things and learned alot of things aboutmyself and other people, i mostly realized that i needed to start focusing on myself and not everyone else because once high school over this little dramatic world is all gonna be gone, and that is what i intend to do.  besides that we went to the movies eventually and chris told us that white chicks was playing at issaquah, IT WASNT. so we hung around there and then the guys left and we saw garfield which was a kick ass movie by the way i wanted to laugh my ass off the whole time. then on the way home we all stuck our faces out the window and it felt soo cool, it was like being a dog as lauren put it. now im home telling everyone my day and i need to get in the shower bad.

						    hey... its been a while... but the last couple days days seem to be getting better for me so i dont feel like i have much to write about. my birthday may not be a living hell after all. i think i found something to do.. teals moving this month. its scary. i dont want her to leave, i dont know if i could SURVIVE without her here. oh well, its only to kirkland, so i will see her alot. its still a very scary thought. i guess up until now i always figured they were just talking about moving.. and now that they actually found a house its starting to set in. ive done alot in the last couple days so im not even gonna bother telling you, not like you care. anyway im watching dawsons creek so i really cant focus on what im writing at the moment. ugh, i hate sappy love shows... they never fail to make you feel alone...    urlLink   urlLink     urlLink     dedicating this post to teal, im gonna miss her so much

						    still dont know what to do for my birthday. dammit i hate my birthday its stressful. last year was easy becasue kim did most of the planning. but NO not this year.. this year i do... nothing. someone told me i was a hopeless romantic today. tasha said i was too. i donyt know if thats true, but it sounds cool.. rosalee.. a hopeless romantic.. hah. yeah i like the sound of it. anyways last night i went to this concert thing with tasha i saw the biggest wigger i think ive ever seen. it was funny he was following us and he was like 'hey b' and we were like 'hey fag'. hah. great. i also saw this really cool guy at the skate park, he rode his bike and he was very good. i liked him. he was the only one that wasnt a stoner. i wish i knew someone like that... tonight i am going to see napoleon dynamite with people (dont know exactly who yet). hhmm.. later skaters...  even though i STILL dont know any COOL skaters..  so your not even desserving of that name.

Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them. You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.

						   uh. its 7.30 in the morning, i didnt sleep much at all, my dad just had to cook fish at midnight, which is a problem because i sleep on the couch, and if you know my house you know the kitchen practically IS the living room too. i hate the smell of fish. i went through a whole bottle of febreeze trying to get the smell away. i ended up sleeping on the front porch at like 4, and at like 5.30 i was rudely awoken by the neighbors fat ass dog. anyways im about to leave for warped tour as soon as teal and the 'nicks' get here. hah. yeah 2 of them, how confusing is that? anyway. ill be ack tommorow so until then...

						   its funny how everytime you get in a fight with a friend you think man if i could just have them back everyhting wouls be fine. but then when you do have them back, its still not enough. the trth is, i want someone to love. cheesyiest thing you ever heard right? but its true. i hate seeing love movies or people who are so happy together knowing that i dont have that. i cant stand it. and the more it makes me realize. i wanna be in love. i want someone whos not amazing or perfect. i want someone whos just normal, who screws up, because i screw up too. but im loyal, and i never feel like i have to see other people because i could be with the same person forever and be fine with that. i see guys getting hurt by girls who just want to be with other guys and those guys still love them and i dnt even need that and i still dont have someone like that. all i want is someone who will say they love me. who will be there when im scared or sad. dont have to always be there, but just to be held and feel safe. i hate seeing guys chase girls who dont want that! i guess i just want to hear 'i love you'  thats the cheesiest thing ive ever wrote but im a cheesy person.

						   ive been really tired all week. ever since ive got back from ocean shores i just dont want to get out of bed. whats the point anyway?  i saw butterfly effect yesterday i loved it so much.i got sick of saying what ive been doing since you probably dont care. so im gonna start telling you other stuff. were still loooking for someone to take laurens place at warped tour. we have an extra ticket. my birthdays next month. if anyone has an idea of what i should do tell me. i have no idea. i got a call today from that special someone and it made me feel alot better. he said im the first girl hes ever been close to and sometimes he gets shy around me and thats why hes quiet. it made me feel really good.  bye suckers

						   why do guys beat themselves up over girls who dont want them? PLEASE someone tell me. i dont think ill ever get it, maybe im an idiot but somehow i dont comprehend. its always the best guys too, the ones that have so much that almost any girl would be willing to treat them good. but no, they pick the wilted ones. I hate it, and this isnt about one person so dont ask me who, its about quite a few. dont do it. just stop it before no one wants you anymore. i give up. because my comments are either taken as bad intentions, or a lieing heartbreaker, if thats what people think so be it. i can handle it. but im gonna say this out to ALL the guys who at this moment are thinking abut a girl who isnt thinking about them, give up, stop trying to tell yourself she is thinkig about you because shes not.

						   ok. lets start off from the last post i made. well i went to ocean shores and i brought teal. i had a great time, and i wish i didnt have to come home. so i came home last night and did some stuff and went to bed. now lets move on to Warped Tour because thats whats good right now. Warped Tour is next weekend and i and so fucking excited you have no idea. lauren backed out and now we have an extra ticket i think nick asked james to come but i dont know if he is yet. i hope he can, ive never been really friends with him but he seems cool. so here i am at my last topic, the topic im scared shitless to talk about. next year. next year i enter liberty. ok thats not the bad part. Teals fucking moving to who knows where and isnt going there, i havent talked to lauren since i left for ocean shores but her blog said she wasnt going to liberty i dont know what thats fucking about but if she leaves i sware i dont know what ill do. if anyone whos reading this doesent know nuch about me, lauren is my best friend and shes been there since third grade and i dont know if i know how to function without her. i fucking hate this. teal is my other best friend, shes the one who is always there for me at the last second when no one else is. besides that i have acqaintances and other friendships, and dont get me wrong i love those people to death, man thier my world. but if they both leave i will be nothing. i wanna shoot my own head off i hate this. maybe im a fucking drama queen but this is high school i wanna have fun and i cant do that. if you wanna be my friend IM me, because as of next year ill be lucky if i have any.  if you all also didnt know, i believe in karma, and i believe you desserve every bad thing you get and earn every good one. i know i havent been the best person but i dont know what i did to desserve this.  and im stealing aunas post dedications but i dedicate this post to all my freinds who arent leaving, and to the hope that laurens really not leaving and that thing in her blog isnt true.  "still waiting for the good karma ive earned to kick the fuck in."  Lee

						   I just listened to that song. I like it alot. anyways yesterday was a pretty laid back day i slept in and then got online and talked to peole then i went to laurens and then me and lauren came here to try to get people to come to the movies on friday, its now friday and not only can i not find lauren, we havent really gotten anyone either. So, i think im gonna be sitting here until i leave tommorow morning, because obviously no one even cares that im leaving. i dont mean to sound whiny.. thats not me at all. i guess im just in one of those days where everythings just bllaa. The summers not as great as it was supposed to be because all my plans are folding. even warped tour, the only thing i was looking forward to is dieing, lauren cant go so now i have to find someone to take her ticket. once agian im left cleaning up shit. on the up side everyone else is having a really good summer which really does make me happy, but i just wonder when its gonna be my turn. oh well im leaving tommorow morning im very excited to see people i havent seen in a while so i probably wont be writing for long. so until then... ill leave you a quote that i like. hah because its already in here but o well.. a little reminder..  "hopefully youll forget, any words that i put in print. my luck, youll change, have stregnth enough to walk away."  Lee

						    i feel sick. i wanna puke and my head is pounding. i have this wierd feeling in my stomach. i guess its the butterfly feeling. which is wierd because im not even talking to anyone. i only wanna talk to one person. but i cant. because im a wimp. i dont know why im a wimp. i never used to be a wimp. im still not a wimp. but you make me feel like a wimp. you also make me feel creative. this morning i made a scrapbook and a collage that is now hanging in my room behind my couch. errrr. the butterfly feeling is coming back. and when you have a stomach ache butterflys dont help. i cant eat and i cant sleep. i hate today.  wow i have never felt like this before. this is very anti-rosalee.

						    i hate being an only child. i hate having to stay home all day and clean. dont get me wrong... i do alot of things actually, and i dont really mind cleaning.. but the days that i do stay home are horrible. you wake up in silence, an empty house, and it remains that way all day. sometimes i call people.. just to assure myself that i havent gone mute. what choice do i have? theres NO ONE else to talk to. or sometimes i turn on the radio just to sing along, hear myself. hear ANYTHING. i know it seems funny that im writing in my journal about silence. but the truth is that its pure torture hearing it. no person can stand pure silence, thats why in the silence we think, we fill our minds with thoughts about anything we can just to mask the silence, and when you stay home all day, continuing to fill your mind with thoughts it actually becomes worse then screaming, because this time the screams are in your head. thats why the truth is that theres no such thing as awkward silences, silence is an illusion.  just a piece of mind. something to think about... something to mask the silence.

						    although it actually wasnt a hell this year.. well well... todays my real birthday. i slept all day. hah. thats ok because ive been doing stuff for my birthday for like the last week. but i feel like i havent slept for a month. this is like the first time in my life that ive been extremely tired. yesterday i went to seattle. with teal and lauren and auna and tasha.. natalie was supposed to come.. she had to leave last minute:(. i didnt get to do anything big the night before because i thought chris was having a party and i didnt want to ruin it for him.. even though he never had it. oh well. Brendan came over last minute. that was very nice of him. im not gonna bore you with what ive done all week. to sum it up. good week, i love seattle, and no one died this year on my birthday. thats suprising...    urlLink    the love of my life.....

						    hah. ^thats a line from dawsons creek. sorry i really havent written lately.. ive been busy. my birthday still isnt going to be as great as i hoped but i think things are finally starting to fall in place. at least no one died this year... or at least havent yet. i got a private teacher for my birthday. im really happy i wanna get better so im not scared to play around people. it would be nice to be able to play around my friends without being scared out of my mind. i get to go shopping in seattle too with a bunch of friends.. now i just have to decide who....  i learned "my generation" on my bass. this is a big step up for me. that is the hardest song ive learned yet. im real proud of myself.. and to think only like 9 months ago all i could do was look at it and wish i could play it.  hhmm.. im hungry now so bye bye.
