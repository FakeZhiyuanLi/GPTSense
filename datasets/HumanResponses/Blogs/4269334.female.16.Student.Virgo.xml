         slashed wrists, blood streaming out... i scream, for help in an abyss, im isolated, my eyes start to close...i hope... my past is brought before me....i pray it was a mistake...forgive me... wasnt intentional, it happend, it was meant to be... fate or destiny...call it whatever...

         Your presence does not make a difference, You are here with me, I don't feel anything at all, When you're gone, I wont miss you... This anger, this pain you inflict on me...is too much too take I wait for the day, I am in peace... When will that be? I wonder

      i woke up, and i had a slight headache... as the day progressed the headache became worse, it came to a point where i couldn't even look towards the sides...because my eyeballs hurt...and i am stupid because i didnt bother going to the nurse for a panadol. mr. martin, is seriusly insane! we are not any AP class students.. he can't give us like fucking packet to read for a night..seriusly doesnt he realize we got other classes too? oh today after school was sooo funny hahaha.... wehn school ended my brothers and i were coming home..so on the way this corolla comes infont of us and it almost caused an accident. this fag was sitting in the car... realizing its his mistake he shows my driever the middle finger... hahha.. damn my driver got pissed and he was abotu to bang the car in their car but what he did was raced him... till taht guy almost peed in his pants.. .and raced offf... my driver was going to beat the shit out of him.. but he wouldnt stop..so we started chasing him, but unfortuantly this car came infront of us and we had to slow down where as that car took a turn and sped off.     I lay on the bed, taking my last few breaths, Thinking of you, and all the times we've had, Regretting, decisions I made.... Oh, What I wouldn't do...to go back... Change what we had, I don't want it... Infatuation, is what all it was... Did not have a deeper meaning, Thoughts provoke me, I am miserable, I don't have much time..... Oh what I wouldn't do....to go back... Lying on my bed, with the last few breaths... Tears run down my cheeks, If only I had another chance, Oh what wouldn't I do... To make you realize...to only tell you...I am sorry... Alas, it's time for me to part... My eyes close...my last tear drops.. I bid farewell....
