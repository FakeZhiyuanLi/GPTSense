      The the national media finally caught on to the  urlLink rampant corruption  that pervades Philadelphia's mayors office.  All I can say is, it's about freakin time.  The  urlLink WSJ  confirms Street's "Pay to Play", quid-pro-quo politics, funneling bribes through City Treasurer Corey Kemp, who "wanted four more years to do our thing".  (Picture a rapper-like thug pronouncing it "do our thaaang".  Street's goons epitomize race-baiting and political cronyism.    This past fall, I worked heavily on the Sam Katz election campaign.  Republican Sam Katz, a repeat contender and Ed Rendell's director of economic development, promised to bring new hope to a city in decay.  Though the cards were heavily stacked against Katz with over 3 to 1 Democrat to Republican ratio, in miraculous fashion Katz stood a fighting chance, early on.  It is common knowledge across the city that John Street has a histroy of shady dealings, malfeasance,  urlLink rote corruption , not to mention administrative ineptitude.  Democratic Mayor John Street, urban slumlord, is Philadelphia's modern day  urlLink Marion Berry .   Street's policies are keeping Philadelphia down, whereas DC, New York, and Boston are thriving.  Philadelphia, in decline, is losing population each year and hemorraging businesses, in part, thanks to an overbearing wage tax.    Election time rolled around and Katz was within range, when it became national news that the FBI was investigating Street for his suspected criminal involvement.    Then the unthinkable happened.  Race-baiter that he was, Street was able to demagogue the investigation, energizing Philadelphia's lockstep minority electorate to turn out for him like lemmings.  He misconstrued a legitimate investigation by the FBI as a racial witchhunt and a heavy-handed Republican power-grab.  What was even more deplorable, were the amount of outside money and political influence that were smuggled into the city to help a crook get re-elected.  Both Clintons, Gore, and and countless other Democratic operatives turned out to stoke the racial flames.  The whole ordeal was an utter travesty, but this renewed media attention and indictment of Street's treasurer serve to remind responsible Philadelphians of what they have known all along.  It was a shame that Sam Katz failed to remove this man from office.    Street won't stop until Philadelphia is driven into the ground.  Thanks to Street, the city could very well become the next Detroit 15 years from now.  And that's not all...Street's most egregious sin of all was driving Koch Fellow and Philadelphia native, David J. Healy, ostracized like a Palestinian, out of Philadelphia and across the cold, wintry, and polluted Delaware River, and into refuge in the trash refuses of New Jersey....

      Knight Ridder is distributing an  urlLink article  about a GAO report which rather bleakly describes the situation in post-war Iraq. The headlines tend to sum it up as something like "Iraq is now worse off".  First of all, that is not a very accurate summary of the article itself. To say that Iraq is currently worse off in a few key areas is not at all to conclude that it is worse off  overall ; that holistic determination is quite difficult to make, especially when you're working with only a few statistics. The GAO doesn't make that conclusion, and neither should the headline writers.   But moreover, it seems to me that some of the statistics the report relies on are badly misused. The report claims, for example, that the Iraqi court system is more clogged now than before the war. Well, I imagine a country wouldn't have much of a problem with the courts being clogged if it was, you know, a  totalitarian dictatorship . If the reason the courts are clogged is that we're trying to give people due process, then maybe a little court-clogging ain't so bad.  I don't mean to downplay the bad news contained in the report or to suggest that we have done everything right in Iraq (we certainly haven't). I just want to caution against the glib use of statistics in deciding the complicated and important question of whether we've improved the lives of Iraqis.

      John,  I concede that Ann Coulter is polarizing to people on the opposite side of the political spectrum.  I would add though that it is in part because she has been targeted by the left.  I would also re-emphasize that she is nowhere near as bad as Michael Moore.  As for your charge that she can not persuade, I would just venture the caveat that there are varying degrees of persuasion.  I think she can be persuasive, granted not as persuasive to novices, independents, and liberals, but definitely more so with people who are already somewhat conservative, or who have sort of inclination.    Furthermore, not everything that one writes should be held to some high-falutin standard of persuasion to be considered relevant.  Her writing also informs conservatives of issues, often political.  Note too that informing is another purpose that writing can serve.  Her writing also energizes some conservatives, which conservatives likely consider a favorable effect of her work.  What I see in Ann, on top of her writing ability, that makes her great are two things.   1) Her tenacity and assertiveness, contradict the seeming monopoly    on assertive, politically active women held by liberals.    (Conservative women on the whole are less confrontational than     liberals.  Of course, exceptions abound.)  2) I think conservatives need more emotionally involved people.  I    think that liberals do a better job of crusading for what they    believe.  Liberals also have more political stuff with an     entertainment component, and I agree with you that her work     does have entertainment value for some, myself included.  One criticism, is that I think it was wrong for you to bring up discussion of her weight.  Most people politics aside would agree, she is an attractive woman.  If we are ever going to mention a person's apprearance, it should generally be a positive comment, otherwise we should keep it to ourself.  We learned that one in kindergarten.    As for Erica's comment, no one ever said/implied that all women should strive to look like her, nor is there a single definition of beauty, nor is beauty solely physical appearance, nor does it count for all that much.  So Erica, I would say that you are wrong to call the unattainble standard of beauty that causes some women to feel self-concious about their appearance, the "conservative" standard.  I would say the reverse is true in that "liberal" sources i.e Hollywood, women's magazines like cosmo, popular music, etc. are much more responsible for making women feel self-concious about their bodies.   urlLink Spin Sisters  is a great book that articulates this point of view very well.  Michelle Hinman will vouch for me on this.  Ann Coulter has spoken regularly for the Young America's Foundation, CPAC, and  urlLink Conservative Leadership Seminars  as John mentioned.  She he would not be such a popular speaker, who is repeatedly invited back, if she was an "idiot" or a "nutcase" as Fabio so defamed her.     Yes Fabio, that is slander.  I am not going to call you names, but you saying that you "despise" her is despicably harsh.

      The previous pseudo-debate surrounding Ann Coulter and her antics is an interesting one. Ann Coulter has become a figure roughly equivalent to Michael Moore in modern politics. While I believe that Ms. Coulter has a higher standard of journalistic integrity than Moore (she is, for the most part, factually correct in her pieces), she polarizes rather than persuades--that is, she is a rallying point for those onthe left who like to point out how heartless and partisan conservatives can be. Whether she is right or not, her rhetorical method of presentation is rude. All the sneering and pessimistic inflexibility that we on the right despise in, for instance, third wave feminists, Ann manages to espouse for the conservative cause; and those who delude themselves on this point are demonstrating that they either agree with these alienating tactics, that they don't care for the art of persuasion and for the careful propogation of ideas, or that they are, indeed, solely into Ann's work for entertainment value. Like a professional wrestler or Chris Rock, she is interesting (for a while).    Having met Ann in person and having taken pictures with her at a luncheon sponsored by the Clare Booth Luce Society, I can attest to only two personal points (and only two).  1) Ann is terribly underweight. This may be a result of a medical condition, etc. in which case, I have nothing but sympathy for her. However, she is not the kind of woman the Republican Party (or any party) should market as the standard for beauty. To encourage women to starve themselves into a coulter-esque physique is not only degrading and demonstrative of a perverse definition of beauty (one that requires unnatural sacrifice in women), but dangerous and irresponsible. Most women could not look like Ann if they tried--and most men would prefer that they not. A woman with a naturally beautiful and full body is both more historically beautiful (look at pre-Kate-Moss cultures) and more feasible.  2) Ann is a very poor speaker. She does not respond well to questioning and she, generally, reads from a prepared script. To many, rightly or wrongly, this gives the impression of "idiocy." Based on her relative ineptitude in handling unfamiliar topics in front of live audiences, this is neither an outlandish claim nor does it demonstrate some character flaw in the person who would pass-down such a judgment.  Ann is a polarizing figure in American politics, but she is also a figure dwindling in popularity precisely because she alienates most readers and listeneners who haven't wholly bought into the belief that all liberals are liars, traitors, and thieves. I know many liberals...their hatred of Ann is understandable. My dislike for her (among other things) is based on her disrespect towards my honest, kind, and warm-hearted liberal friends. To blindly lump a group of people bound loosely by political ideology together and then to lambaste them with such harsh terminology truly is "idiocy"--whether the other side is willing to engage in similar tactics or not.

      Are Democrats  urlLink aborting their electorate ?  Among other points in the this article… 1) Democrats have more abortions than Republicans.   2) More abortions mean less Democratic voters, more so, than more    abortions means less Republican voters.  If Democrats want to    abort themselves, I say go right ahead.  (I am pro-choice).     Sense the irony here?  Pun intended.   Here is the kicker conclusion paragraph:  "As liberals and Democrats fervently seek new voters and supporters through events, fund-raisers, direct mail and every other form of communication available, they achieve results minuscule in comparison to the loss of voters they suffer from their own abortion policies. It is a grim irony lost on them, for which they will pay dearly in elections to come. "  I'd say this idea is still up for debate (as Ben pointed out to me), but it is definitely a new way of looking at an issue that has routinely beaten to death and "sucked" dry like the brains of tragic, baby victims of partial birth abortion.

      My conversation today over lunch break with a girl handing out information for fundraising with the DNC:   Girl:  Hi, would you like to help beat Bush in 2004?  Me:  Actually, I'm a supporter of him, but would you like to explain to me why I shouldn't be?  Girl:  I would love to argue with you, but that's not my job.  Me:  Okay.   I walk off and buy a banana. 15 minutes later, I walk up and she is just finishing haggling a woman who said she didn't have money on her but wanted to support the cause. The woman insisted she worked for a nonprofit and was thus short on funds, and asked said Girl for her website. Girl said she was sorry the woman was low on cash, but couldn't she please give them at least half the amount she was thinking about donating? Woman walked off and said good luck.   Enter me.    Me:  Hey, can I ask you a question? If I told you I was really undecided about Bush [I may very well be ... -Ed.], would you argue with me then?  Girl:  No. That's not what I'm here to do.  Me:  So what's your job?  Girl:  I am fundraising for the Democratic National Committee.  Me:  Right. So what is the protocol they tell you to follow?  Girl:  I am to raise money from our constituents.  Me:  But wouldn't you want to convert more people to your cause if you truly care about Kerry winning? Wouldn't you want to persuade me so I would give you money, too?  Girl:  No. If you like Bush, you won't give me money, right? So why should I try to convert you?   Affirming smiles mutually exchanged, I tell her to have a nice day and walk off.   More interested in grabbing the money of those already on their side (or even, on the off chance, actually comprehending with their philosophy) than explaining to the rest of the country why they too should care about the Dems? Complaining that Republicans are just out to get money and care nothing for the common people while wheedling money from street passersby (who are clearly not, in any way, the common people)? Sounds about right.

      I think it was over at MR where I first saw this a while back. Here is a song by Rush called, "The Trees." Rush is well-known to be libertarian in their beliefs. See what they have to say about fixing income inequality below:   There is unrest in the forest,  There is trouble with the trees,  For the maples want more sunlight  And the oaks ignore their pleas.   The trouble with the maples,  (And they're quite convinced they're right)  They say the oaks are just too lofty  And they grab up all the light.  But the oaks can't help their feelings  If they like the way they're made.  And they wonder why the maples  Can't be happy in their shade.   There is trouble in the forest,  And the creatures all have fled,  As the maples scream "Oppression!"  And the oaks just shake their heads   So the maples formed a union  And demanded equal rights.  "The oaks are just too greedy;  We will make them give us light."  Now there's no more oak oppression,  For they passed a noble law,  And the trees are all kept equal  By hatchet, axe, and saw.    Well put in my mind.

      For the record, Saddam tried to buy Uranium.  Gee I wonder what he wanted with that?  urlLink Uranium   "New Iraq Leader believes Saddam connected to Al Qaeda":  urlLink Al Qaeda Connection   WMDs check.  Al Qaeda Connection Check.  (Not to mention the extensive laundry list of Saddam's other gross war-provoing infractions).  Brokaw is the usual anti-war motivated liberal in this line of questioning:  excerpt:  Allawi: We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And - the war have been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists.  Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism.  Brokaw: Prime minister, I'm surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq.  The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida.  Allawi: No.  I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida.  And these relations started in Sudan.  We know Saddam had relationships with a lot of terrorists and international terrorism.  Now, whether he is directly connected to the September - atrocities or not,  I can't - vouch for this.  But definitely I know he has connections with extremism and terrorists.  No matter what, most Democrats are going to continue to be in denial and oppose the war, even if subconciously for partisan, election-year reasons.

      From: Letter to Koch Listserve Tue 6/29/2004 12:27 PM   Subject: [KOCH]     For all the undecided voters out there... If you don't like Bush's foreign policy you can put our future in the hands of a man who wants to "grow the spiritual left movement,  obtain peace and mindfulness within ourselves and talk about possible solutions" ...or we could just blow ourselves up and save the terrorists the trouble.     Yes, this came from the Kerry website:   Yogi Jenn Joos, Oregon   Jenn Joos is a Kundalini Yoga teacher in L.A. and hosts Kerry Fundraisers.   “I felt that the yoga community could be a resource to reach out and talk about the important issues in a positive, constructive way. Often when politics were discussed at the yoga center after class, there was frustration at how things were in the world...but no solutions. I saw it as an opportunity to educate ourselves on issues, talk about the possible solutions and not feel so powerless! or hopeless. Kerry is an antidote for both politics-as-usual and a boost for the growing Yoga or “Spiritual Left” movement. Yogis believe in positive change. It starts as peace and mindfulness within ourselves by practicing Yoga, and filters out to help reach out to others in the world around us. We have a wonderful chance to help financially, but also give a message that “yoga voters” want peaceful world resolutions, socially conscious programs and resource sustainability for our future.   I say that this is sickeningly hilarious.

      Koch Fellows,   My good friend from school, Dan Kline has a Protest Warrior Chapter.  It is a great organization that opposes left-wing protests and demonstrations, and does a little counter protestation of its own.     Watching some of the clips and reading a little from  urlLink the website  (and from elsewhere and my personal visits to some of these demonstrations), many people wouldn't believe some of the radical tactics that many of these maniacs employ.  When the mob mentality sweeps over them, they are so full of hatred and a wreckless disregard for truth, reason, and couth.   Anyone who wants to is welcome to join our U of Penn chapter for the periodic updates.  There are numerous other towns and colleges with chapters.  You can browse by state.  Just go to  urlLink this link  and click on "register".  There are no obligations and if you decide to, I'm sure that you will be glad that you did.  Pass this on the word to fellow anti-protesters.....

      Here's the  urlLink latest PJ ORourke Article  for anyone interested. (I know a bunch of Koch Fellows went to see him last week.)   I don't agree with O'Rourke's premise that Rush Limbaugh is merely are "preaching to the crowd".  Rush runs his "Advanced Institute for Conservative Studies" and 14.5 million listeners tune in every week.  I know for a fact that he regularly changes hearts and minds, and shapes the opinions of his listeners.  Listeners call-in and give confessionals about him converting them from Democrats quite often.  Michelle Malking writes  urlLink "In Defense of Conservative Talk Radio" , and rebuts some of what O'Rourke was saying in his "snarky" article.    I would also note her observation that the troops want Rush.  Certainly not "Nationalized Public Radio" or Al "the Freak" Franken.  The only preaching that Rush does is through his "talent on loan from God".

      My country right or wrong, right Scott?  You know, there are more than two types of people in this country. There's some good and bad in both parties.   And yes, I do think the Republican Party is a collosal failure that is only marginally on the right. And when I mean right, I don't mean pro-business, and small government. I mean, pro-guns, pro-specific businesses, pro-religion and sections of government that are smaller.   And no, I am not a Democrat and don't support their socialist mantra.  And no, I'm not a LP sympathizer either. Anarcho-capitalist my ass.  I personally don't think that there is much difference between anyone who identifies hard-core with any party, be it Republican, Democrat, Communist, or Nazi.   Just watch where your allegiance lies. Is it with America or is it with the Republican Party?  Just my thoughts...  -Ed Mease

      Ann Coulter rocks even though the left has so aptly demonized her to the extent that the right has Michael Moore (though characterizations of Moore as such are warranted).  If you are a conservative (as am I), then I highly suggest getting the  urlLink Ann Coulter doll  for your girlfriend.  I got one for mine and she loves it.  Fabio sent some rant to the Koch listserve about "educating ourselves about the other side."  My feeling is that people who publically espouse something like this are most often the people that are least likely to live that way.  I doubt many people have actually read anything by her, so I am inviting you to do so.  Here is her lastest  urlLink debunking the Clinton's "vast right-wing conspiracy charge."   Fabio also "doesn't trust anything by Fox News," but  urlLink here  is one where she defends us "crazy" Fox News viewers, because I know there are a lot of us out there, more so than there are CNN (aka Clinton News Network) viewers.  Can I also just say that it is an outrage that a lot of the DC area networks don't even carry Fox News, the most watched name in news.  Last, here is a great piece by Ann that was posted on Town Hall that  urlLink Michelle Hinman so kindly shared  with the group last week.  I liked this excerpt: "Though Kerry makes liberal ladies' bosoms heave with his self-advertisements about his Vietnam experience, the Democrats might not want to let Kerry pursue this particular line of argument. According to Thomas Ricks' book Making the Corps, the vast majority of officers currently serving in the military are conservative Republicans – "largely comfortable with the views of Rush Limbaugh."   Ann has high-level diction and is very entertaining.

      Libertarians are right to criticize profligate Republican spending, but they go too far, when they put the party at parity with Democrats, who are by far the most reckless spenders.  Koch Fellow, Alex Potapov pointed out the  urlLink ranking by Citizens Against Government Waste . CCAGW's Congressional  Ratings evaluate members of Congress how much congressmen spend.   As Alex pointed out, in the 108th Congress the average score for House Republicans was 72%; for the House Democrats, it is 17%. In the Senate, the numbers are 70% and 19% with 100% being the high and 0% (Teddy Kennedy types) being the low.   If you still aren't convinced, I would also submit that my organization, The National Taxpayers Union, also does a ranking, called Bill Talley, which can be accessed at www.ntu.org,and of the biggest spenders, Democrats perennially come out on top   Here is a  urlLink great article  that ran in the WSJ influenced by Chris Cox, former Reaganite and Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the House.  (He's from Cali for you Cali people out there.)   It talks about reform efforts by Republicans to do away with some of the institutional biases toward bigger spending, such as spending being only a "guideline", a complicated committee system, "baselining", deadlocks at the ends of sessions, and lack of executive recssionary/line-iterm authority.  The article is fair, because although Republicans are better than Democrats on spending, it points out at the end that some Republicans aren't as accepting of the reforms.  Check it out.  Republicans aren't perfect, but Democrats, sure as hell, are a heck of a lot worse.

      Rick Moran, who is a congressman where I'm living here in Northern Virginia, was just accused of making an anti-semitic remark, and leave it to  urlLink CNN  to report it in the contrapositive.    He said something along the lines of "if the jews hadn't supported it, America would never have gone to war in Iraq".     I noticed the usual double standard as the media gave it barely any national attention at all.  The media would have lambasted a Republican such as Lott, though they give Democrats on stuff like this (Patti Murray Bin Ladin is a good guy, Hillary's bad joke about Arabs working at convenience stores, Al Sharpton's Hymie Town, Robert Byrd etc.) a free pass.    urlLink Fox News speculates  that Kerry wants this chump out.   The Jewish population is shifting from predominantly Democratic to a more even split, and stuff like this is part of the reason why.

      On Eve Tushnet:  In arguing against gay marriage, Eve Tushnet argued that children do better when they have mother-father parents because they learn to relate to both sexes, as opposed to only one.  In fact, throughout her arguments, Tushnet made the assumption that non-same-sex relationships are better because they provide gender balance.  Here's what I find to be flawed in that assumption:   1.  Not All Relationships are Good Ones   Not all mother-father households provide a good example of how to relate to the opposite sex, or how to best exemplify attributes of one's own sex.  Consider the example set to children wherein the parents are abusive to one another, or, worse yet, are abusive to the children themselves.  I am not saying the overwhelming majority of mother-father relationships are negative, but I think the assumption that all of them are necessarily positive, in terms of providing role models for children, is fallaious.  Parents are not good parents because they have a penis or a vagina; parents are good parents because, regardless of their gender, they exemplify positive character attributes that serve as good examples for their children.  Honesty, love, trust commitment: these attributes are not bound by gender, yet I think most people would agree that they provide some of the best character attributes in parents.  Mother-father households, like heterosexual marriage, cannot claim a monopoly on providing these (among other) positive role model traits/attributes to their children or society.   2.  Children of Single-Parent Households Are People Too   Regardless of what role models children have at home, there is this other thing that all children, regardless of the number of parents they have, experience: the outside world.  In terms of relating to members of the opposite sex or of the same sex, there are a plethora of social situations that provide opportunities for children to relate to members of both sexes, namely, school.  Moreover, I think Ms. Tushnet's assumption that children of single-parent households are somehow less socially equipped to be successful or socially normal is based on an outdated notion of normality and success.  Like Megan brought up in her question, the real generation to watch, in terms of how children of single-parent homes fare in society, is ours.  Similarly, the generation of children to watch, in terms of how children of same-sex households fare in society, will be the one right behind us.  Just because something used to be normal, doesn't mean it is anymore.  And that would be my two cents on Ms. Tushnet, absent a lesson in What Not to Wear.  Your thoughts?  -Fabs

      Ann Coulter's new book,  How to Talk to A Liberal (If You Have To)  comes out soon.    Since Ms. Coulter is busy telling everybody how to do everything, and casually redefining terms like "Slander" and "Treason" (to say nothing of the word "Idiot"), perhaps she should consider publishing  urlLink a magazine on living .

      I can no longer find this article, so I am going to rip it off:    The discovery that affiliation with the Republican Party is genetically determined was announced by NURTURE, causing uproar among traditionalists who believe it is a chosen lifestyle.  Reports of the gene coding for political conservatism, discovered after a decades-long study of quintuplets in Orange County, CA, has sent shock waves through the medical, political, and golfing communities.  Psychologists and psychoanalysts have long believed that Republicans' unnatural disregard for the poor and frequently unconstitutional tendencies resulted from dysfunctional family dynamics -- a remarkably high percentage of Republicans do have authoritarian domineering fathers and emotionally distant mothers who didn't teach them how to be kind and gentle.  Biologists have long suspected that conservatism is inherited. "After all,"said one author of the NURTURE article, "It's quite common for a Republican to have a brother or sister who is a Republican."  The finding has been greeted with relief by Parents and Friends of Republicans (PFREP), who sometimes blame themselves for the political views of otherwise lovable children, family, and unindicted co-conspirators.  One mother, a longtime Democrat, wept and clapped her hands in ecstasy on hearing of the findings. "I just knew it was genetic," she said, seated with her two sons, both avowed Republicans. "My boys would never freely choose that lifestyle!"  When asked what the Republican lifestyle was, she said, "You can just tell watching their conventions in Houston and San Diego on TV: the flaming xenophobia, flamboyant demagogy, disdain for anyone not rich, you know."  Both sons had suspected their Republicanism from an early age but did not confirm it until they were in college, when they became convinced it wasn't just a phase they were going through.  The NURTURE article offered no response to the suggestion that the high incidence of Republicanism among siblings could result from their sharing not only genes but also psychological and emotional attitude as products of the same parents and family dynamics.  A remaining mystery is why many Democrats admit to having voted Republican at least once -- or often dream or fantasize about doing so. Polls show that three out of five adult Democrats have had a Republican experience, although most outgrow teenage experimentation with Republicanism.  Some Republicans hail the findings as a step toward eliminating conservophobia. They argue that since Republicans didn't "choose" their lifestyle any more than someone "chooses" to have a ski-jump nose, they shouldn't be denied civil rights which other minorities enjoy.  If conservatism is not the result of stinginess or orneriness (typical stereotypes attributed to Republicans) but is something Republicans can't help, there's no reason why society shouldn't tolerate Republicans in the military or even high elected office -- provided they don't flaunt their political beliefs.  For many Americans, the discovery opens a window on a different future. In a few years, gene therapy might eradicate Republicanism altogether.   My Take:  This is obviously a poorly written article about a poorly conducted study in a left-leaning magaizne of some kind.  The idea is interesting though.  I have often wondered about what determines political affliation.  I would think that parental affliation (as a proxy for the politcal atmosphere at home...not genetic makeup), income, leanings of  secondary educational institution (i.e. liberal high schools probably encourage liberalism...of course they also attract liberal students), demographics of the area surrounding home,and religion would be decent predictors, but I really do not know.

      After last week's lecture on "The Role of Government During War and Crisis," I came away with the sense that Mr. Higgs' message was deeply fatalistic. Despite numerous prods on my part at dinner, I retained the sense that his worldview did nothing but describe the world in all its totalitarian gory (glory?), without providing much hope or room for improvement at all. What follows are the substantive excerpts from our email exchange, ripe and ready for your insights and epiphanies.  *  Subj:  Is the system doomed?   You spoke of the way Republicans buy Democratic support for the War on Terrorism via boondoggles to illegitimate special interest groups. You said, too, that this sort of arrangement was inevitable in a two-party system.   My question is what kind of system would you recommend in which a third party *could* sustain itself? Would it be a system of proportional representation with pluralistic coalitions, like that in Israel and Germany? Would it be a form of anarcho-capitalism? How would we break free of the self-perpetuating expansionary government under which we currently suffer and cannot seem to abandon?   * Subj:   Your queries   Dear Diana,   First, I do not believe that the party structure of government (two parties; proportional representation with multiple parties; etc.) makes a critical difference in the process I was describing. So long as public opinion supports a big governmental response to crisis, then the government in power will make that response, paying off whatever opponents occupy positions from which to block it (if those opponents should dare to do so; they too occupy a tricky position, and they can do themselves grave political damage by appearing to be too obstructionist during a national crisis). My main point is that in a crisis, the normal frictions of political give and take are smoothed by an all-around sense that "something must be done," even if getting it done requires cutting some deals that ordinarily would not be cut. Crisis, so to speak, bursts the dam that normally holds back government expansion. Whatever the party setup, those same forces tend to prevail. That's why the ratchet effect may be observed in the history of all the economically advanced Western countries, despite their differing political institutions (recall my graph of Sweden's experience).   As for a third party, in this country such parties are virtually impossible to sustain except at the utter margins of politics. The two major parties have engineered the system (voting districts, requirements for getting on the ballot, etc.) in a jillion ways to ensure the continuing domination of the two-party cartel. Their mutual profit from this setup helps to account for the countless loot-splitting mechanisms now built into the system.   As for anarcho-capitalism, that is not a genuine option. Only a handful of dreamers and idealists even know what it is, and if it is explained to others, 99 percent of them will reject it out of hand. It's what the politicos call a nonstarter.   Hence, we won't be "breaking free." The present system bids fair to persist indefinitely in more or less its present form: ebbing and flowing between tyranny so severe that it restricts economic prosperity, on the one hand, and sufficient room for entrepreneurial maneuver to allow economic progress, if only at a slow pace, on the other hand. Extreme collectivism is constrained by economic infeasibility; extreme market reliance is constrained by a statist dominant ideology and its expression via democratic politics. We are locked into a bad situation, though it is not so bad as it might be (and has been in the USSR, China, Cuba, and so forth, where tyranny produced very bad outcomes indeed).   I regret that I can't be more hopeful; uplift is not my specialty. Every person on earth, however, can embrace a personal commitment to justice, though the whole world seem dedicated to injustice. Although we have to pay taxes and obey laws (more or less) to avoid physical violence against us by the established rulers, nobody must give affirmative support to the tyranny in which we find ourselves enmeshed. Though we are slaves in body, we need not accept that status in spirit. We ought never to bow down to the bastards.   Robert Higgs

      Last night at the Koch Fellows speaking event with Clinton Bollick of the Alliance for School Choice and founder of the Institute for Justice, I wanted to raise a few key points about the school&nbsp;" urlLink Voucher Wars " in America today.   By far, liberals and Demcrats represent the main opposition to voucher plans across the US.&nbsp; I tried to flesh out the following to points during the question and answer:   1) A John Kerry presidency and its consequent power of appointment would be devasting to&nbsp;IJ causes such as school vouchers&nbsp;in courtrooms across the US.&nbsp; (Bollick's two favorite justices are Thomas and Scalia.&nbsp; He was able to win support of Kennedy, Rehnquist, and O'Connor with the liberal justices dissenting in the 5-4 Zelman v. Simmons Harris voucher case.)   2)  urlLink 6% of the Dem top brass at the Democratic National Convention&nbsp; (10% as&nbsp;Bollick pointed out, if one includes the AFT with the NEA) are teachers unions.&nbsp; Along with "church-state separation"&nbsp;groups like the ACL(iberal)U and  urlLink People for for the (UN) American way, these are the two biggest blockades to voucher plans .&nbsp; The teachers unions represent an especially entrenched and organized opposition to&nbsp;school vouchers.   I'm sure that&nbsp;the partisan nature&nbsp;of my questions as always&nbsp;may have made people who have considered themselves Democrats (or Kerry voters)&nbsp;or who have grown up in places/hold views&nbsp;that are more hostile to the Republican label, a little uncomfortable.&nbsp; (That is one reason why we have a disproportionate number of people from the south and who are Republicans in our program as compared to Democrats and even true libertarians)&nbsp; On one hand, making some people a little uncomfortable is what I was trying to do with my questions as always.   I also wanted to take what&nbsp;Bollick was saying and apply it to the&nbsp;political reality of&nbsp;the two party framework.&nbsp;&nbsp; Save my question and a few hints or allusions by Bollick throughout, he really was non partisan, although conservatives and Republicans (although not perfect) have shown themselves to be more supportive of Bollick's causes.&nbsp;   Fabio mentioned affirmative action below.&nbsp;  urlLink Libertarians side with conservatives in opposing affirmative action  as evidenced by&nbsp;this Cato article&nbsp; debunking "Affirmative Action's Myths" that ran&nbsp;on Fox News.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Affirmative action: without it, they say that minority students who apply to America’s elite colleges and universities will be denied, shut out by a “glass ceiling” of prejudice.    At the same time civil rights leaders worry that minority students will be trapped in lesser institutions of higher education, top flight schools like Harvard, Yale and my own Bates College, are scrambling to make sure that minority students are not only attending their schools, but are increasing in visibility.   I never knew it when I came to Bates, but I was accepted to be one of those “visible” minority students.    An e-mail I received from the admissions office told me that as one of my class’ “affirmative action admits” I was requested to participate in a study and seminar on diversity at Bates.    I ignored the e-mail, and I kept ignoring the repeat e-mails until I received a call from the office; an appointment was set and I was expected to show.     Though I felt degraded and insulted to be designated an “affirmative action admit” after four hard years of work in high school, I am glad that I went to that meeting.    I realized then and there, that no matter how many programs we create to thrust minority students into higher education, real diversity does not exist in American high education.     When I reported to my survey discussion group, I was asked if I felt that Bates was a diverse place and whether or not I felt comfortable as a minority at Bates.    Did I have any reason to feel uncomfortable?    I hadn’t thought so, though raising the question immediately made me feel that, perhaps, all those smiles and waves as I walked around campus were not polite ways of saying, “Hi, how are you,” but “Oh, how pleasant, there’s a little dark one running about.”     What affirmative action advocates miss is that diversity truly exists when issues of race need not be discussed.    Real diversity is recognizing and awarding the talent and intellect in individuals without considering their race, that as Martin Luther King Jr. said, it is “the content of their character” that matters, “not the color of their skin.”    Such vigorous attempts at forcing diversity onto a campus through discussing issues of race only amongst minority students serves only to stigmatize, not integrate, them.         The reality is that the glass ceiling that used to prevent minority students from ascending to the highest ranks of our society no longer exists.    A qualified African-American or Latino student is just as able to get into Harvard or Yale or even Bates if they have distinguished themselves academically as any Caucasian student.    That many black and Latino students aren’t present at these institutions is due more to the glass ceiling that exists in their own minds—the belief that a private school will reject them or that a private education is completely unaffordable.         Yet, both of these attitudes are simply without merit: academically qualified students will gain acceptance and if finances are an issue, more and more schools offer ridiculous amounts of aid to help pay for the cost of tuition.    The onus on creating diversity is not on the institutions, where attempts, like the one I experienced at Bates, lead to more stigmatization.    The onus on creating real diversity in higher education is on students themselves, regardless of race.     All in all, I consider Bates to be a diverse place; my friends come from all different parts of the country and the world.    My debate partner, for instance, is from Pakistan.    But what makes me appreciate the diversity I experience at Bates is that I can take it for granted: I know that my debate partner is from Pakistan and I am interested to learn about where she comes from, but my respect for her culture need not make an issue of her culture.    I respect her because of our common humanity.    In the interest of true diversity, colleges and universities across America should pay the same respect to minority students: to their humanity, not their race.      urlLink Cross-posted .

      Watch Kerry's Iraq War Documentary as he flips...flops...and then flips again on his rhetoric regarding the Iraq War.  It is an incredible, must watch, and I can't emphasize it enough.   urlLink https://webmail.wharton.upenn.edu/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://demsextrememakeover.com/  ("Kerry's Iraq War Documentary")  I just can't get over how firm Kerry's support of the war used to be before he became his shameful post-Veitnam self.  (Now again, he supports the war by the way.)   It is all about political expediency and political opportunism.  The Democrats and John Kerry needed something to criticize President Bush on.  It's grotesque how they are misrepresenting the facts and misleading the American public Michael Moore-style.   Copy, paste, and forward this, so that others can see Kerry's waffling war progression.

      Last night while watching the DNC Convention, I was more than a little revulsed, when Ron Reagan tried to pigeonhole opposition to/reservations toward stem cell research as&nbsp;originating from squarely from religious peoples' beliefs, which as he called them- were "nothing more than beliefs".&nbsp;   What got me was not so much that&nbsp; urlLink the prodigal son&nbsp;was using junk science to misrepresent the Bush administration's position on&nbsp;stem cell research&nbsp; &nbsp;(article written by a Cato guy) or that the only reason that&nbsp;Reagan was speaking was because Democrats were shamefully trying to capitalize on the good name and death of the greatest modern American president; what got me more than a little peeved was half an hour or so later, when the Democrats had an Imam reading from the Holy Koran. Democrats suddenly displayed a grossly contradictory and ostentatious act of religious solemnity like never before.&nbsp; Talk about shameless pandering to Arab voters or "diversity" or whatever they were trying to do!&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, I want to go on record saying that was just about&nbsp;most respect that I have ever seen religion accorded by the Democratic&nbsp;top brass&nbsp;ever!&nbsp;   Just think, would Democrats ever ask an evangelical to come and read from the Bible at the DNC convention? Answer: Never.&nbsp;   Just think, what would happen if the Republicans brought a priest to their convention to give a sermon? Answer: Democrats would have a hissy fit and cry foul.   This basically goes to show that in the post Post 9/11&nbsp;world,&nbsp;Islam has become the unofficial religion of the Democratic party.&nbsp;   On a related note, Yoga is also a "spirituality" of the Democratic Party (see also my post from a while back&nbsp;titled  "Yogis" Courtesy Michelle Hinman ).&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what was&nbsp;posted on the Kerry website a while back:&nbsp;   [Yogi Jenn Joos, Oregon  Jenn Joos is a Kundalini Yoga teacher in L.A. and hosts Kerry Fundraisers.   “ I felt that the yoga community could be a resource to reach out and talk about the important issues in a positive, constructive way. Often when politics were discussed at the yoga center after class, there was frustration at how things were in the world...but no solutions. I saw it as an opportunity to educate ourselves on issues, talk about the possible solutions and not feel so powerless! or hopeless. Kerry is an antidote for both politics-as-usual and a boost for the growing Yoga or “Spiritual Left” movement. Yogis believe in positive change. It starts as peace and mindfulness within ourselves by practicing Yoga, and filters out to help reach out to others in the world around us. We have a wonderful chance to help financially, but also give a message that “yoga voters” want peaceful world resolutions, socially conscious programs and resource sustainability for our future ."]   I thought these values/expressions of faith by Democrats were just plain goofy and twisted.

      My organization,  urlLink The National Taxpayers Union, was cited in the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal&nbsp;yesterday . The article points out that Kerry promises higher taxes and a "grab bag" of 76 new spending proposals.   A Report by  urlLink NTU  claims that Kerry's proposals would increase government spending by $226 billion in his first year in office, about $2,000 per American family, or 10% of the federal budget.&nbsp; The author estimates Kerry's proposals at 2 trillion from 2005 to 2014. This is much more spending than President Bush, granted many of the bills that Bush has signed have been appalling costly.&nbsp; (I very much disliked the Medicare and Education Bills and want to see him veto the highway bill or it not get through congress at all.)   The&nbsp;article goes on to point out that in flip-flopping fashion, Kerry is trying to have it both ways by presenting himself to voters&nbsp;as both a free-spending liberal and a deficit hawk.   Here is another great article&nbsp;that points out the phony  urlLink Democratic storyline (talking points) about how&nbsp;the economy has fared from Bill Clinton's two terms until present . (On an economic sideote, the&nbsp;consumer confidence level just rose to&nbsp; urlLink its highest level&nbsp;since June 2002 .)  Anway, here are&nbsp;three great points that get blurred as Democrats have&nbsp;attempted to misrepresent Bill Clinton's economic legacy:   1) The Republican Revolution in Congress was more responsible for balancing the budget and reforming entitlments (welfare) than Bill Clinton.   2) Clinton presided over the dot com boom.&nbsp; The roaring economy had little if anything&nbsp;to do with his governance and lots to do with the private sector (free markets).&nbsp; (Alan Greespan was a carry over from Reagan).   3) The recession that continued through the beginning of Bush's first term has since been revised back to have begun on Clinton's watch.   On a final note, Democrats thrive on class rhetoric.&nbsp; I would like to offer some great advice for the insanely rich people such as the Kerry's who don't think that they pay enough in taxes.  urlLink GIVE IT BACK .&nbsp; In fact, supposedly a Massachusetts law allows them to do just that, but I wouldn't expect the Kerry's to actually do this anytime soon.

      Koch Industries, which funds the  urlLink Koch Fellows Summer Program , &nbsp;is a decidely&nbsp;Republican/Libertarian/Conservative&nbsp;Organization.&nbsp; It is also well known that for generations&nbsp;the Koch Family (Fred, Charles, and David), which funds our endeavors,&nbsp;has held conservative/libertarian economic beliefs that put them much closer to Republicans than Democrats.&nbsp;   Fred Koch was a member of the  urlLink John Birch Society , which a liberal magazine such as  The Nation  might call "ultra right".&nbsp; (Note too  urlLink in this muckraking, leftist, conspiracy theory of an article&nbsp;from  The Nation &nbsp; how Koch supposedly pumped loads of money into the National Republican Senatorial Committee, helped Bob Dole become Majority Leader, and aided the candidacies of other prominent midwestern Republicans.)   David Koch helped found  urlLink Citizens for a Sound Economy .&nbsp; This is an organization with links to articles by Dick Armey, Jack Kemp, and Bill Bennet&nbsp; on its home page and which has at least two clearly, anti-Kerry/Edwards reports on its home page, placing it decisively in the conservative column. (Recently,&nbsp;CSE has been in hot water for allegedly&nbsp;helping the&nbsp;Nader Campaign get on the ballot in Oregon.)   Clint Bolick, a conservative who the Koch Fellows will be fortunate to hear speak, made his name fighting the conservative cause against affirmative action.&nbsp; Then Koch money enabled him to found the  urlLink Institute for Justice , which has come to be viewed as the conservative equivalent of the ACLU.   Koch has also poured lots of money into the Tax Foundation and the Federalist Society, both decidedly conservative groups as well, and also Cato, though libertarian, is much more conservative than liberal on most issues.   Since 1998 alone,  urlLink Koch Industries has given George Mason (one of the most conservative law schools in the country)&nbsp;$14.4 Million dollars .&nbsp; About half of that money went to the Mercatus Center.&nbsp; Presumably a lot of the rest went to the Insitute for Human Studies which makes our (including mine)&nbsp;Koch Fellowships possible.   Koch Money has aided our current Republican president.&nbsp; When President Bush&nbsp;took office in 2000, his administration created a "hit list" 23 anti-free market regulations&nbsp;to scrap.  urlLink 14 of the 23, which were ultimately targeted&nbsp;were reccomended termination by Mercatus .   An Arcticle from CNS News points out that  urlLink Koch Industries is a major GOP donor .&nbsp; Koch donated $332,000 to Republican congressional candidates during the 2000 election cycle, David Koch gave $250,000 to the Republican National Committee between 1999 and 202, and the two&nbsp;gave a total of $6,000 to President Bush's 2000 Campaign.   This last article also points out near its end how the Clinton Administration possibly targeted Koch Industries for its political support of Republicans.&nbsp; Because of its support of  urlLink "the country's most prominent conservative and libertarian voices", as this article calls it , a politically motivated Clinton Adminstration issued a 97-page indictment against Koch Industries in 2000.&nbsp; This came after Democrats in the Senate launched an investigation of Charles Koch in 1996. Luckily, when the  urlLink Bush administration took office in 2000 the charges were promptly settled .   So why am I pointing out all of this about stuff about the vast and intricate connections between Koch money and Consservatives/the Republican Party?   If you ask me, Koch Fellows who call themselves Democrats or say they are registered that way and even more so go on spewing liberal rhetoric and arguments across our&nbsp;blog&nbsp;have a lot of gall. Here they are in a program which&nbsp;places its fellows at organizations, a preponderance of which are conservative, and therefore more Republican than Democratic, and they&nbsp;obviously don't hold dear the&nbsp;same&nbsp;values and political philosphies, which the Kochs no doubt hoped that they would be fostering through the munificient contributions.&nbsp;   The Koch family is a generous benefactor to us all and I think that they might be dissappointed to see Koch Fellows supporting liberal orthodoxy and Democratic politicians (such as Fabio's lauding of Bill Clinton, etc.) who have been antithetical to Koch principles and even hostile to the Koch Industry.&nbsp; I have read some of the things that have been&nbsp;posted on the blog (and I am not referring to posts by all Koch Fellows) and see it as a big slap in the face to our benefactors at Koch.&nbsp;   Fabio asked me the rhetorical question a while back "who am [I] to speak for Koch Industries"?&nbsp; The answer is that I am a beneficiary of their generosity and a like-minded supporter of the same political causes as the Kochs.&nbsp; I am also proud to say that the Koch money that has been spent on me is money much-appreciated, money well spent.&nbsp; I feel good saying this as one who is loyal, not traiterous&nbsp;to Koch's many causes.&nbsp;

       1. &nbsp; At the risk of sounding like a bleeding heart liberal, I do hope that my fellow libertarians checked out  urlLink Bill Clinton's speech  last night at the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; I did, and I almost cried.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; It was almost overwhelming to see Clinton speak for the first time in God knows how long.&nbsp; The man is just eloquent, something our current president cannot lay claim to.&nbsp; It makes me wonder about that eternal question of the political elite: Whatever happened to statesmen?&nbsp; What happened to great orators who filled halls with words that rang through the ears of their audience like music?&nbsp; Clinton has that, as does Hillary, and it is that quality that I hope John Kerry and John Edwards can return to the White House.    2. &nbsp; Last night a friend and I had a friendly exchange about free market capitalism and whether or not it would work if it were given the chance.&nbsp; To me, the ideas of von Mises or Hayek and those like him are no different, except in method, than the ideas of Engels or Marx.&nbsp; I recognize that there is a difference between capitalism and communism, but what essentially remains the same is that both systems are based upon ideals-- ideals that humans may strive for, but never actually reach.&nbsp; It's akin to what Nietzsche said about perfection, that to reach it impossible, however much we might strive.&nbsp; Humans strive to live up to their ideals but never really do.&nbsp; So, on paper a completely free market system would work, while in practice it most likely, like its communist-ideal counterpart, would not.&nbsp; The problem with economists and academics is that their ideas remain in the realm of ideas, rarely ever actually put to test to see if they stand up to the ultimate scrutiny: the real world.

      Daniel Okrent has in i urlLink nteresting piece in the  New York Times  on liberal bias in the  New York Times  . Okrewnt admits the bias of the paper, but says that it is "urban" not just "liberal," and that the urbanization of the paper is a direct result of the city from whence it sprang. A short excerpt:    I'll get to the politics-and-policy issues this fall (I want to watch the campaign coverage before I conclude anything), but for now my concern is the flammable stuff that ignites the right. These are the social issues: gay rights, gun control, abortion and environmental regulation, among others. And if you think The Times plays it down the middle on any of them, you've been reading the paper with your eyes closed.

      I thought I'd never post on marriage, but that was before I had something wildly unpopular to say about it.&nbsp; On Wednesday,  urlLink Erica posted  about the alleged weakening of the institution of marriage in the Netherlands following&nbsp;the legalization of&nbsp;same-sex marriages,&nbsp;citing the separation of marriage from parenting as the link.&nbsp; Let's ignore the debate on the veracity and significance of the story for the moment and stick it in the "Gay marriage weakens traditional marriage" pile of argumentation, and assume there's at least some truth and some significance to it (that is, there is reason to infer causation, and the political/cultural situation in the Netherlands is sufficiently similar to predict the same results in the US or universally).   So what?     What if gay marriage really does undermine straight marriage?&nbsp; In order to make some sort of judgement about the effects of gay marriage, assuming we knew what those were, we have to answer a few questions.&nbsp; First,&nbsp; how much do we value straight marriage, particularly as evaluated in the survey cited above?&nbsp;   If we're judging the "strength" of straight marriage by indicators like the number of divorces and births out of wedlock, allow me to offer some social variables that  strengthen  straight marriage.&nbsp; Where there is ess financial independence for women, divorces will be less common.&nbsp; Where women have fewer choices and opportunities for education or work, more will seek security through marriage.&nbsp; Excision certainly cuts down on infidelity.&nbsp; And hey, for a sure-fire way to ensure the "strength" of marriage, as evaluated by births out of wedlock, try honor killings and radically enforced sharia ( see also : northern Nigeria).&nbsp; If we assigned an infinite value to stable straight marriage, we wouldn't think twice about the necessity and value of the above.&nbsp; At some point, individual, family, and community happiness come before the strict indicators of a stable marriage used in the study.   Secondly, then, we have to ask how much we can afford to weaken marriage.&nbsp; If we could prove, for instance, that legalizing gay marriage would definitely cause exactly one more divorce each year, I think most of us would agree that extending the right to marriage (or the marriage "franchise")&nbsp;to&nbsp;the homosexual population&nbsp;would be worth it.   What is missing between the study's&nbsp;conclusions (again, assuming truth and significance) and "gay marriage ought not to be legal" is something like this:  The legality of gay marriage weakens straight marriage to a point below what is optimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such gay marriage also diminishes the individual, family, and community happiness that we hold as ends, to which marriage is a very good but imperfect means.&nbsp;    Moreover, it might be important to demonstrate that the&nbsp;reduction in happiness above is greater than the increase in happiness resulting from lots of gay people finally being able to marry.&nbsp; And while I will abstain from getting all post-modern on my small audience, I should also add that it's important to ask what constitutes good parenting, because wedlock certainly isn't both necessary and sufficient to that end.   My point is not that undermining or weakening straight marriage is a good thing, nor, more specifically, that more divorces and births out of wedlock are good things.&nbsp; They're almost always bad things.&nbsp; But since we don't assign and infinite value to mere marriage and births in wedlock, the implications gleaned from the cited study aren't nearly enough to merit substantive conclusions.

      Since we've been talking about whether or not the New York Times is biased, I though I would include this.  urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,126249,00.html    How come Fox News is the only news source that reported that Sandy Berger took papers out of the National Archives by putting them  in his socks ? I think that's a pretty important distinction. I can maybe buy that he walked out with the papers in his pockets unknowingly...maybe. But his socks?  It seems that anyone reading Fox News and reading that he put the papers in his socks would immediately assume that Berger was lying and intentionally trying to remove documents.  Just thought I would present some "Fair and Balanced" bias against both the New York Times and FoxNews.   Personally, I really like the Wall Street Journal because it is generally objective.&nbsp;The Financial Times too for that matter. Both are excellent papers. I&nbsp;try not to&nbsp;read NYT or watch Fox News though.

      I have noticed a distinct bias from the NY Times on how they have chosen to cover the Sandy Berger revelations.&nbsp;    urlLink Check out their article .    urlLink Then check out the Wall&nbsp;Street Journal Story .   It is amazing how differently they chose to frame, report, and write about the same story.   The Times try to play it off as a "furious" Republican attack and tries to play up&nbsp;Berger's "tireless service", even if he could have been devious/incompetent.&nbsp;   It also tries to downplay his connection to the kerry camp.&nbsp; Anytime the mention that he was an advisor they have to use the word "informal".&nbsp;   The Times using the word "mishandling" to describe stealing/smuggling and destroying highly classified documents, which is a felony, and then doesn't tell what he is actually accused of doing- stuffing them in his pants- until near the end of the article. It also relied on statements by Berger's lawyer, but gave no statements from investigators (they aren't legally allowed to, so those by his lawyer should also be left out).   Also, the article doesn't&nbsp;put in quotations&nbsp;the statement about his actions being "inadvertant", which is implicity saying that this is stipulated fact, which has not been proven.&nbsp;&nbsp; (There could have been motives).&nbsp; Circumstantial evidence and speculation suggests that there was.   Definitely take a look at the two different ways of looking at the story. By reading each one carefully for yourself.   This is the second story by the Times about this same subject.&nbsp; The last write-up was even worse.&nbsp; It said that Democrats were "willing to give him the benefit of the doubt" and "Republicans were less charitable".&nbsp; It also said that Republicans "zero-ed in" on the case as if to imply purely partisan criticism and it place statements questioning the timing of the revelation much higher in the article and gave them more weight than they should have.   Here is a great chain letter that has been circulating about the differences between the major newspapers.&nbsp; I have gotten it three different times over the last year and a half:   1. The Wall Street Journal is read by the people who run the country.   2. The Washington Post is read by people who think they run the country.   3. The New York Times&nbsp; is read by people who think they should run thecountry, and who are very good at crosswords.   4. USA Today&nbsp; is read by people who think they ought to run the country but don't really understand the Washington Post.&nbsp; They do, however, like their statistics shown in pie charts.   5. The Los Angeles Times&nbsp; is read by people who wouldn't mind running thecountry, if they could spare the time, and if they didn't have to leave LA to do it.   6. The Boston Globe is read by people whose parents used to run the country and did a far superior job of it, thank you very much.   7. The New York Daily News&nbsp; is read by people who aren't too sure who's running the country, and don't really careas long as they can get a seat on the train.   8. The New York Post&nbsp; is read by people who don't care who's running the country, as long as they do something really scandalous, preferably while intoxicated.   9. The San Francisco Chronicle&nbsp; is read by people who aren't sure there is acountry...or that anyone is running it;but whoever it is, they oppose all that they stand for.&nbsp; There are occasional exceptions if the leaders are handicapped minority feminist atheist dwarfs, who also happen to be illegal aliens from ANY country orgalaxy as long as they are Democrats.   10. The Miami Herald is read by people who are running another country butneed the baseball scores.   11. The National Enquirer is read by people trapped in line at the grocery store.   I used to get the NY times emailed to me, but I stopped that a while back when they started running John Kerry ads on everything even what was supposed to be their "objective news" pieces.&nbsp; The WSJ wouldn't do something tacky like that.

      If everyone remembers our debate a few weeks ago on the matters of same-sex marriage, you might recall the experiment practiced in the Netherlands touted by Mr. Rauch.&nbsp; The Netherlands is the first country to legalize same-sex marriage, having done so in 2002.&nbsp; Though the mere two years that have passed since the practiced has been permitted, the country is already gathering data as to the effects of this&nbsp;campaign.&nbsp;   A letter from Dutch scholars to other nations' parliaments notes a drastic decline in Dutch marriages, which they attribute to "the (legal and social) separation of marriage from parenting. In parliament, advocates and opponents alike agreed that same-sex marriage would pave the way to greater acceptance of alternative forms of cohabitation."  This evidence flies in the face of Mr. Rauch's postulation that allowing same-sex marriage will halt the trend to alternates to marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the scholars note that it may be too early to trace causation in these matters, they advise "that enough evidence of marital decline already exists to raise serious concerns about the wisdom of the efforts to deconstruct marriage in its traditional form."  However, to support these claims, researches can point to the correlations in Denmark, Norway, and Scandinavia between cohabitation with children and the drastic delines in marriage rates.&nbsp;   Hat Tip:  urlLink National Review  and Eve Tushnet at  urlLink Marriagedebate.com

       urlLink This article  in Tuesday's NYT is the latest in a charming trend I call Canting Capitalism.&nbsp; It opens with a delightful mockery of bobos' infatuation with fashionable urban poverty and squalor:  &nbsp;   Simone Shubuck didn't find working in her Lower East Side studio without a bathroom a bit romantic. Actually, she found it weird that visiting dealers and collectors always declared her bohemian deprivation "absolutely charming." As time passed, Ms. Shubuck, now 34, found herself yearning for prosaic luxuries like a toilet, health insurance, a pension plan.  &nbsp;  This is the same reaction we see when first-worlders visit developing countries to ooh and ahh at the wholesome, natural lifestyles of people without modern conveniences like Peapod, Netflix, plumbing, or vaccinations.&nbsp; Absolutely charming.  &nbsp;  The article goes on to describe the Artist Pension Trust, which also received ink/pixels in  urlLink the Economist  [$], and gets a rough treatment from Tyler Cowen  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .&nbsp; It's an interesting scheme, and TC provides a number of valid critiques as to its viability as an investment.&nbsp; Whether or not it's the best pension plan doesn't interest me for the moment.&nbsp; What does interest me is this aspect:  &nbsp;   "It's a way of taking advantage of the capitalistic nature of the market* and mix in a healthy dose of socialism to create a hybrid form," said David A. Ross, the former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art and then the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, who is the Artist Pension Trust's president. .... Socialist inclinations aside, the trust isn't meant to be altruistic.  &nbsp;  I'm intrigued by the marketing of capitalism here.&nbsp;  urlLink Mutual Art , the company behind the Artist Pension Trust, targets a generally market-phobic audience who, as one might glean from the article, wouldn't ordinarily invest in any sort of pension scheme.&nbsp; Now, there are those of us who find markets elegant, but there is no shortage of people who find capitalism aesthetically unappealing.&nbsp; Pop culture images of robber barons, destitute Dickensian protagonists, exoticization of underdevelopment, and romanticization of "starving artists" reinforce this all over.&nbsp; The capitalist ick factor is manifest in the anti-globalization movement,  urlLink numerous films , and clearly, the art world.&nbsp; What's interesting is the market's adaptation to this set of anti-market preferences.  &nbsp;  Take [Sub]Urban Outfitters, which siphons money from rich teenagers who shell out to look destitute and bohemian.&nbsp; The current fad in "ironic"  urlLink $80 t-shirts  stems from a  past  trend of shopping at thrift stores - which was first a trend out of necessity, and quickly became an exercise in irony.&nbsp; There are countless other examples of people spending money to appropriate the charm of socialism.&nbsp; A more mainstream example is  urlLink socially responsible investing , where investors choose firms based on their contributions to their communities, their treatment of animals, their hiring diversity, or anything other than the firm's predicted profitability.&nbsp; This allows investors to engage in the market, without that nasty morning-after feeling of exploiting the worker/land/kittens.&nbsp; I see the Artist Pension Trust as simply the latest idea in making capitalism more palatable to those who find poverty and/or socialism more romantic, but who can't deny or resist the benefits of a market system.  &nbsp;  So where's this amusing hypocrisy taking us?&nbsp; I predict that, given the prevalence of vague anti-market preferences among  urlLink bobos , the rise of bobo culture will bring about more creative ways to be capitalist without the aftertaste of oppression.&nbsp; And eventually, maybe private enterprise won't taste so bad to the cultural elite.  &nbsp;  *Ahem, capitalistic nature of the market?&nbsp; As opposed to what?&nbsp; Is that like the bovinistic nature of the cow?  &nbsp;  [Gratiuitously cross-posted at&nbsp; urlLink Brooke's' blog , and  urlLink my own .&nbsp; When you write less than once a month, you really have to milk it.&nbsp; Bovinistically.]   UPDATE: Will Wilkinson takes me on at the  urlLink Flybottle .

      Yesterday I commented in Scott's post on Arnold's "manly women" remarks about the importance of rhetoric and diction when in politics. And I thought I'd provide an example of what I was talking about through a  urlLink rhetorical analysis of Bush's last (and hopefully last  ever ) State of the Union address.     Take it as you will, but what a person in power says  does  matter more than what someone on the street says. Schwarzenegger should not have been attacked as sexist or homophobic. Rather, he should have been attacked for being tactless and stupid. The same goes for Dick Cheney: these people are our leaders, representatives to the rest of the country and world. Statesmanship requires that we demand a bit more from our leaders in their public behavior and methods of address.

      I just finished reading the book  Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror &nbsp;written by "Anonymous", a current, senior CIA analyst with 20+ years of experience examining transnational terrorism, Afghanistan, South Asia, Al Qaeda (AQ) and Usama Bin Laden (UBL).&nbsp;&nbsp; You can read the  urlLink introduction  and  urlLink excerpts .  Anyone can borrow the book from me.&nbsp; I personally find this book very&nbsp;scary because the analysis&nbsp;is spot on- it challenges many of the assumptions I have held about UBL and AQ and paints a deadly accurate picture of the War on Terror.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. Anonymous assesses that AQ is stronger than it was before 9/11 in spite of, and to a large extent,  because of  US conduct in the War on Terror.&nbsp; The US government just flat out does not understand the grave threat that AQ really poses.&nbsp; AQ is not a terrorist organization; UBL is not a terrorist- to label either as such underestimates their power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, AQ is the forefront of a global Islamic  insurgency  being waged against the United States and UBL is more Robert E. Lee than Al Capone (i.e.&nbsp;more a cunning, calculating&nbsp;tactician who inspires fanatical devotion among his men rather than a ruthless criminal).&nbsp;  &nbsp; Unfortunately, US leaders still believe that AQ leaders and cells&nbsp;can be hunted down one-by-one and brought to Texas-style justice, and&nbsp;that&nbsp;the removal of terrorist sponsoring states will sap AQ of its&nbsp;fundamental sources of power (or "center of gravity" for you military types).&nbsp; Mr. Anonymous points out that AQ's center of gravity comes from Muslims' perceptions of the need to wage&nbsp;a "defensive jihad" against the US, not from its leadership, finances, safe havens, etc...&nbsp; UBL has convinced his followers and fighters, and they are many, that specific US policies- &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; US support for Israel 2.&nbsp; US troops on the Arabian peninsula 3.&nbsp; US occupation of Iraq/Afghanistan 4.&nbsp; US support for Russia, India, China against their own Muslim militants 5.&nbsp; US pressure on Arab energy producers to keep prices low 6.&nbsp; US support for tyrannical Muslim govts. (e.g. Saudis, Pakistan) &nbsp; - directly threaten Islam.&nbsp; Whether WE think those policies are a threat to Islam does not matter; UBL has already convinced thousands (perhaps hundreds of thosands/millions?...unfortunately nobody knows) to take up arms in Islam's defense because of them.&nbsp; This goes back to the whole "Why do they hate us?" argument.&nbsp; I agree with Mr. Anonymous (and with Ron Paul's remarks today), those waging war against us hate us because of what we do, not who we are- UBL's statements directly echo this.&nbsp; I will be happy to debate this point in more&nbsp;depth with anyone who wants to challenge it.&nbsp;   So what is the solution, Mr. Anonymous? Well, American policy makers need to develop a strategy which focuses on AQ's center of gravity.  Neo-conservative strategy to transform the Middle East into something resembling Western, democratic, secular society only fuels Muslim perceptions that Islam is under attack and strengthens AQ's center of gravity.  The US government instead needs to address those 6 policies listed above that enable AQ to motivate Mulims to become "soldiers of God."  If US policy makers (and the public) believe that maintaining these foreign policies is much too important and worth the costs of fighting a global insurgency then the only other alternative is total anihilation- "killing in large numbers" combined with a "Sherman-like razing of infrastructure" in the Muslim world. Half measures like those taken in Iraq and Afghanistan will not do. The US must essentially kill everyone and destroy everything where AQ might be- that's the only way to eliminate them b/c they have seamlessly integrated themselves into dozens of societies around the world.  I share Mr. Anonymous' views and believe that current US policies are a recipe for continued defeat. Anihilition of the Muslim world is not feasible/wise/moral. AQ has already successfully scattered to the four winds. Is there any opportunity left for a decisive military blow? I fear that nobody knows. It's time for the policy makers and the public to have a vigorous debate on the strategy for the war on terror (let's face it, there is NO current coherent strategy for addressing a global Islamic insurgency) before it's too late to employ any alternatives at all.

      Does&nbsp;a spoonful of sugar make the  urlLink smart pill &nbsp;go down?  &nbsp;  A new area of research in memory-enhancing drugs poses the question of what intelligence is, the standard nature/nurture debate as to how much eugenics is worth pursuing, and how much of it is unproductive and illegitimate. I think to call the use of a drug that enhances your memory something out of  Brave New World  is a bit much -- even now, people use gingko biloba, other memory-enhancing&nbsp; urlLink natural supplements , and even fish oil (in Russia, people&nbsp;consumed this in spoons out of bottles in its pure form as a form of vitamin) to increase their memory. Ultimately, I think, one's intelligence is not all inborn or biological but much the sum of one's experiences. In the Gardnerian sense, broadly defined, intelligence includes not only rote knowledge but also practical, social, and emotive skills, which are generally not packageable.

      I view Political Correctness from the left as the single&nbsp;greatest threat to free speech in this nation of ours.  &nbsp;  Today, because  urlLink Gov. Schwarzenegger made a joke  based on his hilarious Saturday Night Live skit by referring to the CA legislature as "girlie men", there was a resulting Democratic/leftist outcry.&nbsp; Talk about crying wolf.  &nbsp;  I would also like to share two other instances of politically correct overkill.  &nbsp;  Last fall, I argued with my friend, VP of the College Democrats at Penn,&nbsp;til I was blue in the face that it is perfectly allright to use the phrase "jipped" as in "you got jipped".&nbsp; He was dead seriously trying to tell me that the phrase is discrimminatory because he claims that it assigns a negative trait to a class of people, gypsies in Europe.&nbsp; (Yeah, I know how can I be friends and actually live with someone like that.)  &nbsp;  Also the U of Pennslvania " urlLink Water Buffalo Case " is particularly renown.&nbsp; A guy, who was trying to sleep,&nbsp;yelled "shut up you water buffalo" out his dorm window to some loud black sorority sisters who were passing by in the street.&nbsp; They sued for harassment, he was suspended, the case dragged on and on for a long time, and caused the university to enact lots of bullshit programs and waste resources.  &nbsp; On a free speech related noted,  urlLink some evidence has emerged that&nbsp;hands free cell phones could&nbsp;be more dangerous&nbsp;than regular cell phones in automobiles .&nbsp; Researchers claim this is because it is not the act of holding the phone, but rather the act of talking that poses any added risk (I&nbsp;think the risk is overstated), so by encouraging&nbsp;hands free sets in parts of the country, the government is actually encouraging people to talk more and take on&nbsp;more of this perceived risk. &nbsp; This form or nanny-state regulation in highly&nbsp;Democratic areas (DC, NYC, parts of NJ) is very much against libertarian principles, not to mention it curbs free speech by making it more difficult&nbsp;for people to lawfully communicate with each other.&nbsp; John Coleman, I might add,&nbsp;posted about the&nbsp;cell phone ban in DC going&nbsp;into&nbsp;effect a while&nbsp;back. &nbsp;  Libertarians should recognize the threat to free speech that the left so often poses.  (And I haven't even gone into "campaign finance reform".)

      Chuck Colson has an interesting article at  urlLink Town Hall  titled  urlLink Same-Sex "Marriage" and the Economy .&nbsp; Colson examines a Congressional Budget Office Report that claims that gay marriage would actually save the country money, because of the marriage penalty and decreased entitlement benefits for married couples as opposed to singles.&nbsp; I'm not sure that I buy this 100%, but it is interesting to consider.  &nbsp;  Also on a gay marriage related note, David J. Healy and I watched on  urlLink Cspan  a packed room of minority leaders, as they agitated in favor of the gay marriage ammendment.&nbsp; The leaders&nbsp;became nocticeably idignant, when efforts were made by the media questioners which&nbsp;insinuated that opposing&nbsp;gay marriage&nbsp;is "discrimminatory".&nbsp; The leaders were even more indignant, when efforts were made to liken the gay marriage struggle to the civil rights&nbsp;struggle.&nbsp; On a related note, I would point out that I read somewhere that, although whites are roughly evenly split on the issue of gay marriage, only about 16% of blacks support it.&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink Blacks are almost uniformly&nbsp;opposed to gay marriage .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This is ironic because black activists, although not monolithic,&nbsp;stereotypically and statistically-speaking take the hard-left side&nbsp;on many&nbsp;issues.&nbsp; This is also relevant, because the NAACP (see my post below)&nbsp;does not support gay marriage.&nbsp; More precisely, it&nbsp;has tried hard to avoid the issue.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If that isn't ironic enough, it is further ironic, because I'm sure that John Kerry did not speak about gay marriage at the NAACP convention the other night (see Justin's post below), nor do "black leaders" think about gay marriage, when they claim that president Bush doesn't stand with blacks on the issues.&nbsp; At least he does on this one, and as he does on as many issues as he stands with white Americans.  &nbsp;  Colson's article also made me think of another interesting question.&nbsp; Granted recognizing homosexual "marriage" is a lot about coercing/convincing society to accept homosexuality in general and to legitimize homosexual relationships in the public eye, I am also wondering,&nbsp;if these tax benefits could lead people/interest groups to press for these same monetary benefits to be made available to&nbsp;domestic partners (i.e. roomates etc.) and other social units, if they were to be made available available to "married" homosexuals.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  To end on a separate, marriage related note: liberated, man-hating feminists be damned, it seems that more and  urlLink more married women are deciding to keep their husband's last name .&nbsp; This bucks a trend that began during the culturkampf of the 1960s.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I never understood why women could vehemently oppose this, other than if their name was&nbsp;a business or other such asset.&nbsp; I&nbsp;view reluctance to change one's last name as trivial in the first place.&nbsp; The practice has become a systematic tradition for names to be passed down through generations and as a way for couples to be symbolically unified&nbsp;by sharing the same last name.&nbsp;

              This is an interesting  urlLink news item  I noticed today.        China   is trying to remedy the imbalance of male to female infants by giving welfare checks (US$144) to families that do not have male babies. They are also trying to prevent abortions and infanticide by placing a ban. I think that the welfare check system will be a better policy, because people will always try to work around the system to get around bans.    I wonder if this monetary incentive will create an imbalance of girls in rural areas since poorer families would benefit the most from the increased income. Will this also affect the prostitution industry in China once there are enough girls to go around? I remember hearing before that countries with a higher male:female ratio also have more prostitution.

      First they spend our tax money to reduce the number of smokers, and then they subsidize the industry because of "low demand."  urlLink This deal  is absolutely dripping with disgusting regulations. Here's a quote to get you interested; &nbsp; "Until now lawmakers from the tobacco belt have opposed allowing the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco. But they signed off on the new oversight in exchange for a $12 billion, 10-year program to aid tobacco growers struggling for survival in light of lower prices resulting from less smoking and increased imports. " &nbsp; You know you have a problem when Kennedy is&nbsp;a chief&nbsp;sponsor of the bill, but also when it is called a "marriage of convenience." The tobacco industry is basically a government program now, so whether you partake in the wonderful substance of tobacco or not, you are in for a wild ride. I expect ranting.

      Iraq may not have had "large stockpiles" of WMDs, but Iraq did have very dangerous weapons in the past, and it did used them on Iran, on the Kurds, and in the Gulf War.  Furthermore, Saddam would have loved to get his greasy hands on some, and Iraq didn't "fully cooperate" with weapons inspectors before the war.   If you doubt Saddam's intentions to obtain WMDs consider this.  The charge that Saddam had not sought weapons grade uranium turned out to be false.   urlLink Saddam did attempt to purchase uranium .  The  urlLink false negative about the uranium purchase  originated from  urlLink an op-ed by former Ambassador Joe Wilson  in the New York Times (no suprise).  Lord Butler's report also confirmed Saddam's attempt to purchase uranium and vindicated Prime Minister Blair (as did the 9/11 commission of President Bush) of "lying about pre-war intelligence".   To the NY Times' credit though, I will link them for an article that they ran the other day by one of its token conservatives, William Saphire.   urlLink Saphire wrote about what he calls the current "groupthink" surrounding the war .  Right now, the steady media drum beat is "he lied" or "he misled" us, he being president Bush and that media groupthink is just plain false.    P.S.   Michelle and I attended a very compelling booksigning this past weekend about the Connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda.    I would be more than happy to discuss it with any interested parties tonight at the party...THE PARTY FOR BUSH, tonight 7 PM at Oakwood.  Hope to see all Bush supporters and all undecideds there.

      The NAACP has become a defunct organization since its heyday during the civil rights era.  President  urlLink Bush made the correct decision to not speak before them .  Even if race mongers would inevitably try to portray the decision as some "snub" against black people, I applaud his tough decision.  NAACP Leaders, Julian Bond and Kwesi Mfume, have spouted some exceedingly venomous remarks about President Bush and Republicans in general that go far beyond the pale.    They have spoken of a "right wing conspiracy" against blacks, referred to the "Taliban wing of the Republican Party", said that the party "flies a NAZI swastika next to a confederate flag", and accused President Bush of metaphorically dragging a little black girls father (James Byrd) by the back of a pickup "all over again" for not supporting so-called "hate-crime" legislation.  (All crimes should be punished equitably, and President Bush supported the toughest punishment for the crime, the death penalty.)  Education Secretary  urlLink Rod Paige blasted the NAACP today .  President Bush has done so much for blacks and minorities in general (but he doesn't look at it that way, the way a Democrat would).  President Bush concentrates on doing things for  AMERICA , not a particular racial group.    Still, President Bush has the most racially and gender diverse cabinet ever, has spent more on aids relief to Africa, increased funding for education through NCLB and denounced the "soft bigotry of low expectations" in education, and the list goes on.  Paige, a black man himself, points out many of these things that the president has done and classifies the current (not the NAACP of the civil rights era) as "Naked Partisans", which I think is right on the money.  The Bush administration has said that it will reach out to blacks and minorities in other ways.  I doubt that speaking at the NAACP convention really helps any candidate that much other than symbollically, but unfortunately some slanted media accounts of the decision portrayed the decision more as a "snub" than justified rejection of an invitation, and the reasoning behind the decision more as "the NAACP being critical" of the Administration than "the NAACP engaging in exceptionally hostile rhetorical attacks and unfounded slanders" against the Administration.   urlLink Lynn Cheney sought to woo Hispanics  when she spoke this week at the National Hispanic Leadership Conference this week.  This is one tangible act of many more to come of an administration and a party, which genuinely wants to appeal more to hispanics and other minorites.    I am very confident that Republican policies appeal to minorities as much as Democratic ones.  The real test is influencing people to break from tradition and for the Republican Party to better market itself.  The New Democratic strategy of using race politics, fear, demagoguery, etc. to keep minorities in lockstep Democratic voting is equivalent to the much-maligned "southern strategy" of the 1960s.  While I am on race issues,  urlLink here is a little bit of Affirmative Action stuff in Arizona . Basically, the school was handing out raises to minorities and women only, and not to white males.    Lastl speaking of affirmative action, here is an article by Marie Gryphon at Cato, which  urlLink debunks the myths surrounding Affirmative Action . First, that since less minorities are admitted into "elite schools" that means the process is biased.  Second, that since as many minorities don't get into elite schools, their future earnings potential will be significantly diminished.  Both myths are false.  The Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, has become the party of color blind policies and of equal racial rights for all.

      I wrote a response to Diana's post on the FMA; it is four pages, single-spaced, in length.  For that reason, I've placed it on  urlLink my blog .

      Everyone knows the FMA is great for religious fundies. That argument's easy: marriage is a traditionally heterosexual institution, and gay unions are a different can of worms altogether and should be treated as such. Okay, so we see how they would win if the FMA was passed. But it is also great for libertarians.  I'll preface this by saying that most of my argument here is co-opted from a late night conversation with the ever-intriguing  urlLink Eve , but that I really am convinced this is so.   The FMA does not eliminate the "right" of gay people to marry. It does, however:  1) Promote the right of children to be raised in married, healthy homes with both genders as role models, and  2) Give gay couples more liberty by preserving the privacy (and free markethood) of their relationships.  The first point is self explanatory, and to agree with it of course you do need to buy that it is harder, for example, for a boy raised in a lesbian home to grow up with a positive understanding of what it is to be a man (see  urlLink Dawn Eden  on this, T-shirts, and cultural malaise). But the second point is something people are talking about a lot less these days.  If marriage is not about children any longer, and if the only reason government got involved in marriage to begin with was to arbitrate in situations where it is not clear what to do with children, a class of people in society not old enough to make rational, consentual decisions on their own accord, then what place does government have in a marriage institution that is no longer primarily about children? We ought preserve the heterosexual marriage as a government-governed entity, because no matter how much contraception straight people use in these newfangled times, they still pop out babies now and again, and, evil of evils, the government does need to step in to deal with that.   But in a marriage that is solely about the two spouses pledging to love one another, why is it the government's role to put their stamp of approval on that union?   Any libertarian who wants the government to rule on the validity of the love between two same sex individuals should really be creeped out by the contradiction in his opinion. Our world reeks of weird nanny-state notions when it is no longer enough for people to know they love someone until a higher authority validates that love.   Think about it: why exactly does the government need to know or certify the difference between two same-sex friends (gay or straight) and a romantically involved gay couple? You might say that I would trust a romantic partner more than I would a best friend. But I might, if I'm single, trust my best friend with my life more than I would even my parents, and thus I would want to get the same power of attorney packages that let her come see me in the hospital, summon me to a nation to which she has immigrated, and all the other non-child-related benefits of marriage of which the gay community is so shamefully deprived. Heck, throw children in there too -- adoption by gay couples is legitimate and regulated by the law even now, right?  Libertarian gay rights activists should really be focusing on making privatized contract law more concrete, universally recognizable, and readily available to two same-sex people who would legitimately seek to share that package of benefits. Since gay couples are not procreating a previously nonexistant third party (aka babies) into their relationship, they need to stop  begging for the government's stamp of recognition on their love and start seeking their own marketable solutions to the technical difficulties of contract law that currently hold them back.

      As most of you know, I was against the war in Iraq since it was first beginning to be discussed in the fall of 2002. To me though, the one thing about the Iraq situation that is worse than going in in the first place is withdrawing too quickly and for the wrong reasons. That being said, I could not fault the  urlLink Philippines  more for withdrawing their whole whooping force of 51 people out of Iraq because a Phillipino citizen is being held captive by Iraqi guerillas.   I'm sorry, but you made this mess, now you clean it up. The mistake to go into Iraq was made by the United States and the meager coalition we brought with us (for you Fahrenheit 9/11 watchers, The Republic of Toga...The Republic of Iceland), but the decision to pull out now because it is too hard is wrong. Even if it takes us ten years of street fighting like the kind we have been seeing for the past year, every country that joined the coaltion now has the obligation to see it through. One of the worst mistakes in United States history was withdrawing from Vietnam too early because it was "politically popular." The nearly one million Vietnameese people who were consequently slaughtered as a result of our withdrawal have only us to blame.   And all this Philippino withdrawal (and Spain's ealier after the Madrid bombing brought the socialists to power) does is legitimize Iraqi guerillas and throw fuel on the fire. If anything, its an added threat to us now, because with Spain and the Philippines demonstrating that if the going gets tough enough, we'll get out, there's a much greater incentive for a terrorist attack in this country to sway the elections and our policies.   It may seem callous, but it's only one hostage's life. If I were a hostage, I would hope that my country wouldn't be so cowardly as to let my life dictate my government's decisions. It's one life at the expense of many many more.   Cold amoral utilitarianism? Yeah, I guess so.   -Justin H.

      In President Bush's latest radio address, he outlined his reasoning for supporting the highly discrimintory Federal Marriage Amendment.  Like most of the things Bush says, he's wrong.   urlLink And, thanks to Andrew Sullivan, I'm not the only one to say so.   An excerpt:   "Then there is his second premise: that allowing gay people to enter into civil marriage would 'fundamentally redefine' marriage.  In fact, of course, gay couples want to enter into marriage as it is currently defined.  And the fundamntal redefinition of civil marriage to which the president refers occured decades ago--when contraception became widely available, severing the link between procreation and civil marriage..."   I've had a lot of debates over this issue recently, and I've always been stonewalled in responding to the charge that marriage is about the protection of children.  Whereas I do not disagree that children are better off with married parents (same- or opposite-sex alike), tying what is best for children to an institution classically used to protect property or secure nations against war (see: the Middle Ages) seems preposterous, if not delusional.  When I write or talk about things like gay marriage to those who do not (and, most likely, will not ever) support it, I do so out of the desire to express, in terms of humanity, something that for me and those like me is best not explained in terms of logic and public policy.  Libertarians argue that man is born with certain rights that cannot be stripped from him; of course, this is an ethical and moral argument, one that cannot be made in terms of logic alone.  You have to believe it to be true for it to remain so.  The same, I think, applies to gays and gay marriage.

      So, I was wondering: As human beings (rather than libertarians, appreciating the contradistinction between the two), what do you guys think of the modern stem cell debate. Primarily this debate revolves around the use of embryonic stem cells, the acquisition of which requires the destruction of a human embryo. A few thoughts:  1) Abortion: At base, it seems that pro-lifers would have to oppose the use of embryonic stem cells. If a life is a life at conception, then murder for body parts would seem inhuman. Am I wrong?  2) Alternatives: There seem to be alternatives to embryonic stem cell research. Michael Fumento has argued that all the research necessary can be accomplished using adult stem cells. Also, the usefulness of stem cell research in curing say, Alzheimers, seems overrated. Thoughts?  3) Utilitarianism: At what point should societal good play in to the debate.  4) Politics: How much of the modern debate is purely political. John Kerry has said he would leave the "science to the scientists." Bush wants ethical oversight. First, does Kerry actually mean it? Second, is that a prudent policy on such a sensitive issue of biotechnology?  I hope you guys have some input....

      I'm more than a little amused at the accusations floating about regarding John Edwards' supposed lack of qualifications to be vice president.  Perhaps its because I remember another time when the current president was running for office and similar accusations surfaced.  Interestingly enough, these accusations were not thrown around all that much by Democrats, but by members of Bush's own party, who suggested that Bush run for lesser office.  Based upon the botched war on terrorism and the complete lack of foreign intelligence cogency, perhaps the original observations on Bush's foreign policy experience had weight.  I would observe, also, that Edwards, who sits on the Intelligence committee, would be more versed in public policy in comparison to a governor, no less the governor of a state that historically empowers the Lt. Governor more than the actual governor.  Just some random thoughts.

       urlLink John Tabin applied for press credentials as a blogger at the DNC  and actually got it....until the Dems realized that he is a frequent contributor to the American Spectator.  I laughed at this, because Dems can be so dumb, and it reminded me of a stunt that a coservative friend of mine at Penn pulled last year.    Eric Rechtschaffen, a member of the Penn College Republicans' Board, actually got the College Democrats to endorse his candidacy for a student government position by emailing them and using his middle name as his last name.  The Penn College Dems used to hand out their "endorsements" like candy, apparently no vetting whatsoever.  (They would then email their Democratic listserve with the names of the people to vote for).  When the Dems discovered their blunder after the election, they unsuccessfully attempted to go before Penn student government to get Eric disqualified.   This is a case of no standard Democrats.  In Mr. Tabin's case, this displayed the left-wing bias of bloggers at the DNC.  (One can't call the bloggers legitimate "media" or even-handed "journalists".)  And in Eric's case it displayed sloppy administration by college Democrats.  There was also some sloppy administration apparent Tabin's case as well.  Anyone want to throw a Kerry party?  We can make it a dud like his candidacy.

      In a startling  urlLink case  in France, a six-month pregnant French-Vietnamese woman, Mrs. Thi-Nho Vo went to a doctor's appointment for a routine check-up of her child.  She did not speak French well enough to communicate with the staff at the hospital and was mistaken for another women who had an appointment for a local surgery.  Mrs. Vo's gynecologist inadvertently punctured the amniotic sac and had to therapeutically abort her child. Vo took the man to court, charging him with involuntary manslaughter.  The doctor was acquitted on appeal after the court declared Vo's child was not a human being.  As a proponent of pro-life, I am astounded and disgusted at this tragic story. For a number of you, I know you are equally revolted at this blatant disregard for both the child's life and the woman's choice. But I am curious as to how a group of libertarians would respond.  Even beyond the matter of a child's murder, this is a serious violation of the sanctity of life. This cannot even be argued as a matter of the woman's choice; her choice was robbed as surely as if she were raped in her gynecologist's office.    I want to know your reactions.

      How did John Edwards managed to become the vice presidential nominee with next to no experience?  The  urlLink Weekly Standard's Andrew Ferguson  had an amusing, but probably not unfounded hypothesis...  Here is an excerpt:  "LIKE A FEW OTHER excessively nice-looking human beings, John Edwards is a victim of reverse lookism. Common experience, lately reinforced by the most rigorous scientific research, demonstrates lookism's effects: Ugly people never catch a break, while the well-configured among us always receive favored treatment.   In the past, Edwards has undoubtedly been lookism's beneficiary. Having no political connections or experience to speak of, he would never have been elected senator from North Carolina, nor been fingered early on as a presidential prospect by the national press corps, if he had had the face, for example, of Dennis Kucinich, who, as a presidential prospect, has been fingered only by himself."  This is so sad, but yet so true.  I have read/heard a lot of crap today about Edwards potentially "appealing to younger voters" and give the Kerry ticket a "fresh look".  This is code for "John Edwards is a pretty/peppy good looking person and  urlLink he smiles a lot ", so people who judge others partially or even subconciously based on their looks will like him.  I personally think he looks too much like a pretty boy to be considered handsome, but of course, I'm biased.  At least President Bush can say that he actually chose his Vice President for a legitimate reasons.  Cheney had  TONS  of experience,  urlLink much, much more so than Edwards  does now.  President  urlLink Bush hinted at Edwards' inexperience today .    (This article also talks about Bush judicial nominees.  John Hasnas, our speaker the other night, told me that he is concerned by liberal obstructionism of conservative judges and Edwards'preference for activist judges.  Edwards is like Patrick Leahy in the Senate Judiciary, when I watch them on C-span, I want to strangle them both.)  The Drudgereport incorrectly speculated that Kerry might chose Hillary Clinton for his running mate.  This was shown to be tabloid reporting, when Kerry instead picked another white male.   I am keeping track of the  urlLink lack of diversity in Kerry's inner circle , because Democrats/liberals are much more quick to criticize Republicans for lack of diversity.   President Bush's cabinet and his top advisors are far more diverse than any president before him and far more diverse than Kerry's inner circle.  Think Powell, Hughes, Rice, Paige, Whitman, Venneman, Martinez, Gonzalez, Linda Chao, Norm Minetta, etc.  Bush doesn't get the credit that he deserves on this front, because he doesn't go around flouting the diversity within his administration as much as a Democrat would.   On another subject, the  urlLink economy is booming , despite  urlLink Kerry's attempts to distort the facts about the economy .  The AP reports that the " urlLink Economy Set for [its] Best Growth in 20 Years ".  This will become more and more of an issue, especially if America's role in Iraq continues to subside.  Here is a great  urlLink article by a hard-working, small-business owner  who is one of the much-maligned "rich", considered undeserving of tax cuts by Democrats.  Every election year without fail, Democrats bad-mouth "the rich".  Prepare for more of the same this year, especially now that "Two Americas" man (Edwards) is on the trail and ready to play the politics of class.  Kerry was a signatory on a letter to  urlLink meddle with free trade  with China, so libertarians who view free trade favorably should be wary of Kerry/Edwards.

For highly competitive, high paying jobs, men are more suited for the "tournament" style competition.     Also, women are more competitive when men are not around accoring to the study.  So, as Tyler points out, this would agrue for single sex education and prehaps single sex firms.

      John Kerry screwed-up (or succeeded depending on how you look at it) by picking John Edwards as his Vice Presidential candidate to challenge President George W. Bush.  I can't fathom who the GOP could have realistically preferred to Edwards.  John Edwards showed himself to be an inept campaigner during the Democratic primary.  Edwards' ability to emerge as the runner-up in the Democratic primary said absolutely nothing of his abilty, but everything of the shortcomings of the incredibly weak field that he was up against, including Wes "dull, zero political experience" Clark, Al "race demagogue" Sharpton, Carol "I wanna be the 1st black woman president" Moseley-Braun, Dennis "whiny socialist" Kucinich, Howard " urlLink YAAAAAAAA " Deaniac, and Dickie "union tool" Gephardt.   urlLink Edwards managed to win only one state , South Carolina, by an (all-things-considered) slim margin.  Edwards was born in South Carolina and knew the area better than any of the other candidates, the voters in the area knew him, and he spent much more time and money than any other candidate in the state.  Yet, Edwards still only won by 15 points, and Al Sharpton still managed to win 10% of the vote despite Edwards' concentrated effort in the state!    Not only did the Democratic primary demonstrate Edwards' shoddy campaigning ability, but his battle with the other Democrats also rendered him damaged goods.  Kerry and Edwards even used to openly criticize each other before, in usual flip-flop fashion, Kerry turned around today and named Edwards his runnning mate.  What's more, the RNC already has compiled a  urlLink massive stockpile of quotes and ammunition  to use in its campaign against the Kerry/Edwards two-headed monster.  The press loves to look at potential vice presidential candidates in terms of what "added dimension" they can bring to the ticket, or in other words, how potential vice presidents compliment the presidential candidate.    In 2000, Cheney was a wise choice for President Bush.  Cheney (former representative, former defense secretary, etc.) added tons of legislative experience and foreign policy knowledge to the Bush ticket.  Cheney is also an effective debator, as evidenced by his skilled debate with candidate Lieberman in 2000, is great at rallying the Republican base, and is  urlLink skilled on the political offensive , allowing Bush to remain somewhat above the fray.    Edwards, on the other hand, brings nothing to the Kerry ticket except a pretty face, and by that, I just mean that he hasn't yet needed/elected botox injections.  Edwards is young and inexperienced.  Edwards' little foreign policy knowledge showed through in the primary as he rountinely answered foreign-policy-related questions in vague, rhetorical terms.  Edwards' experience in government (not that being a lifelong, opportunist, career politician like John Kerry is a good thing) consists of one measly Senate term.    Furthermore, Edwards does next to nothing to moderate ideologically the Kerry ticket.  Edwards has a lifetime  urlLink American Conservative Union   urlLink rating of 12  on a scale of 0 - 100, which is barely better than  urlLink Kerry's dismal score of 5 .  An ineffective legislator, Edwards has never introduced a bill that has passed Congress, and his signature bill, which he fought hardest for, was his so-called "Patient's Bill of Rights." It was a give-away to his bosom-buddy, trial-lawyer friends -- as if Edwards needed any more reason to be labeled a slavish litigator.    In his article " urlLink Southern Identity ", Tom Curry is wrong to imply that John Edwards, joining the race as a Senator from North Carolina, will have any meaningful significance on the race at all. In 2000,  urlLink Bush won North Carolina  over Al Gore by a handsome 13 percentage points.  With such a cushion, even with Kerry's Edwards-aided candidacy in North Carolina, Bush is still the presumptive favorite to win the state.  Whereas Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack could have locked up his swing state, Gephardt could have given Kerry an edge in Missouri, Richardson in New Mexico, and Graham in Florida, Edwards brings much, much less.  Sure, Edwards speaks with more southern twang than GW, but he might as well be from Mars, because he does little to shore-up a single red or swing state for Kerry.  John Edwards is at least as oppositional to free trade as Kerry, and Edwards made his way as a parasitic trial lawyer, feeding off other peoples' money and extorting companies for exorbitant settlements along the way.  Overall, he is a virtual bonanza for Republicans, thirsty to criticize his liberal policies.  The Kerry Campaign didn't need another John. It already had one who married a wealthy ketchup heiress, and one 'john' is plenty.

      This is one of the  urlLink best pieces  I have encountered since I started reading blogs in the fall.  I read this a while back and really enjoyed it, so I had to post it.  It is written by a guy who runs  urlLink Selling Waves.com .  Here is a glimpse, but you really should read the whole thing, despite its length; you will definitely be smarter for taking the time.   It is my contention that many people allow the laws of government to become a surrogate morality. Instead of synthesizing their own moral code, people are willing to allow the law to determine what is moral and what is not. Furthermore, the illusions created by democratic government reinforce this confusion of laws and morals, making it virtually impossible for many people to conceive of a moral society existing without the rule of law.

      I remember last fall, when the anti-Vietnam War protest pictures of John Kerry with "Hanoi" Jane (Fonda) came out and the interviews of Kerry accusing his fellow  urlLink Vietnam veterans  of war crimes first aired.  A week later, led by DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe, the Kerry campaign went back on its word not to make President Bush's national guard service an issue. They did so presumably in retaliation for the heat that Kerry was taking for his anti-war activity.    The Kerry campaign started the drum beat, Democrats howled and screamed, and finally under intense media pressure, President Bush agreed to  urlLink release his National Guard records  in an effort to quell the politically-motivated demands for "transparency".  The Democratic trasparency/smear campaign was in full force again last week as Democratic lawyers sued Jack Ryan, Illinois Senate candidate, to release his divorce records.  The lawyers got their wish, and there was a subsequent media feeding frenzy.  Despite his denials of the allegations, Ryan  urlLink resigned his senate bid , putting Republican hopes of retaining the seat vacated by Pete Fitzgerald in peril.  Fast forward to this week.  John Kerry, we learn, has some sealed divorce records of his own, but in waffle-house fashion, Kerry  urlLink has resisted opening  them up and holding himself to the same standards to which he held Bush's Guard records.    What's good for the geese should be good for the gander.  Kerry's ex-wife is reported to have been battling serious depression and contemplating suicide around the time of their separation.  Following the Democratic standard, the American public should have the right to know.  What could John Kerry be hiding from the American Public?  Maybe nothing, but this is an example of Democratic hypocrisy (for you Fabio).   How about some equity by the media lynch mob? Bush did it. Ryan did it. Now it's John Kerry's turn....

       urlLink Eve Tushnet on what a gay couple  can  do.   In response:  Ms. Tushnet raises two very interesting points with regard to being a gay person and the possibilities in a life without the possibility of marriage.  First, Ms. Tushnet argues that some people find themselves to be less homosexual than they once thought, that they go on to marry members of the opposite sex and live happy, normal lives. The idea of relative levels of sexual orientation is nothing new; Alfred Kinsey first reported the phenomenon in the mid 20th century. Ms. Tushnet, however, leaves out the vital logical extension of her argument, which, in my view, makes it moot.  Kinsey's report on male (and later, female) sexuality supports Ms. Tushnet's claim. Kinsey posited that sexuality existed on a scale, that no person could, in reality, claim to be 100 percent either homosexual or heterosexual. So, whereas some people may, over time, find themselves to be less homosexual, there are a proportional number of heterosexuals, who, over time, may find themselves to be more homosexual. This explains why later in life, after establishing families and lives, come out as being gay or lesbian; the sliding scale of sexuality works both ways.  So, why does this make Ms. Tushnet's argument moot? Well, there are two reasons, the first a little more obvious than the second. First, if people discover opposite or same sex attraction later on in life, it makes moot the idea that, somehow, people will necessarily discover themselves to be heterosexual (or, at least, less homosexual) later on in life. People will find the opposite as well; so what are they to do? Ms. Tushnet may argue that they should sublimate their desires; I will, later, argue against this idea.  Moreover, in discussing those who are "less homosexual” or "less heterosexual" than they previously thought, I think that Ms. Tushnet is referring to those who would, on the Kinsey scale, fall into the middle ground of sexual uncertainty. The truth is, according to Kinsey, that most people have a fairly consistent interpretation of their sexual orientation; by relative example, they do not end up starting as Yankee fans, then switch, mid-life, to being Boston Red Sox fans. One need only note the increasing numbers of young people coming out as gay or lesbian at earlier and earlier ages to take notice of the fact that people, by and large, are hardwired, if not at birth then very early on, with a distinct placement on the Kinsey scale.  But, perhaps more importantly, if sexuality is a sliding scale in both directions, then there is no logical reason to preference one direction on the scale with rights and privileges over the other.  The fact is, both sides of the scale have the potential to produce long-lasting, deep emotional commitments that enrich not only the lives of children (natural or adopted), but also the people with whom they share their lives (friends, co-workers, community members, family, etc). The potential is the same; it is only the form that is different.  The oft-heard argument, however, is that the major value of marriage in society is that it produces children who, later in life, produce more children. I do not disagree that the production of children is important and that it should be encouraged. Insofar, however, as it should be encouraged, a society based upon ideas of liberty must also recognize the equal rights of persons who do not wish to have children, and must recognize their desires as equally legitimate. If we recognize the rights of heterosexuals to marry and not produce offspring, why, when an astounding 28% of gay couples are already raising children, do we deny homosexuals the right to marry and not produce (or raise) offspring?  There is no coherent, logical argument that can defend such a double standard.  Ms. Tushnet’s second argument centers on the idea that gay persons, unable to marry, should devote their lives to something greater than themselves, that they should channel their passion into something besides forming a relationship. This is, I think, the most shameful example of arguing for second-class citizenship for gay couples. So, left without the ability to marry and thereby secure multitudes of legal protections, gays should drop sodomy, pick up art supplies and paint a better Sistine Chapel? This argument is a call, literally, for gays to revel in the sublime bliss of ignorance.    But that aside, I have three reasons why sublimation and transmutation is misguided and ultimately doesn’t fully replace what a codified relationship offers.  First, I want to respond to this idea of sublimation versus repression. The difference between the two is, I think, is in word pronunciation and not practice. “Deep abiding friendship, great art, and personal sanctity” sounds great at first. But extending Ms. Tushnet’s argument means recognizing that one’s “deep abiding friendship” will still leave someone alone at the end of the night; love, for the sublimated person, is forever stunted and incomplete. “Great art” may provide an escape, but it is necessarily vain and selfish, always in pursuit of that quality of humanity only touched upon by the connection and love shared by two individuals. “Personal sanctity” may sound sublime, but it may as well be loneliness; it is relationships that make a person transcend their own existence and, in doing so, gives them the ability to reflect on what, in their lives, actually gives them personal sanctity. In short, the idea of sublimation, to me, does not seem a whole substitute for the truly sublime experience of loving and relating to another person.  Second, and more practically, should someone have to sublimate his or her sexual desire for “something greater?” I raise this question for two reasons. First, it is blatantly discriminatory that gays, and only gays, would be made to purge themselves of sexual desire or, by extension, sexual expression.  But, secondly, in the spirit of liberty, categorically denying gays any choice besides sublimation (through banning access to marriage and legal legitimacy) violates that spirit of individual liberty on which the country was founded.  If there is no practical reason to restrict someone’s liberty, then we should not allow it.  Third, and finally, I want to relate the idea of sublimating sexual desire to ignoring a big pink elephant in one’s living room: ignoring it, or channeling one’s energy into working around it while doing nothing about it, does not make the elephant go away. Sexual desire is part and parcel of what makes us human and it cannot simply be sublimated. Ms. Tushnet argues that historically, people dealt with sexual desire through sublimation. However, evidence abounds that even though no one saw expressions of homosexual desire, throughout history they have existed. The red tie, the carnation, the green pocket square: all of these were ways that those with homosexual desire would signal to others that they, on the sly, wanted to express a sexuality considered abnormal. Expressions of homosexuality run right through history with as much consistency as religious fervor and the fundamental institutions of Western civilization. That desire was not sublimated; it existed under the radar of the rest of society.  That desire is no longer under the radar. It exists without apology or shame and with varying levels of acceptance amongst a large cadre of Western society. In overcoming sublimation, homosexual desire has reached its most sublime: it has extended beyond itself in an attempt to create something greater and more beautiful than desire.  It is trying to create love.

       urlLink This  should end the debate as to whether or not the Republican Party is paralyzed by the religious right. The Bush/Cheney team is seeking church rosters from "conservative Protestant denominations" to encourage church members to vote in November for Bush. I think that's a pretty strong indication that the Bush ticket is indebted to conservative Church leadership, especially in the South.  I don't know about you, but personally I'm disgusted. I have no beef with religion, in fact I think it's essential. But involving it in politics?  You know, I really liked what Tom Palmer said when he lectured to us a month ago. He basically argued that libertarianism is not a consequence of Christianity or the focus on the individual of Protestantism, but the unique history of the West and the antagonistic relationship between competing sources of authority (Church, state, guilds, etc.). If anything, our beliefs are a fortunate historical accident and not some "faith-based initiative."  -Justin H.

       Please excuse what seems like a non sequitor, but I recently took a class on the Chinese economy and have continued to follow it in the news....   Someone has to let the Chinese government in on what the West already knows… Their ugly-little-duckling of an economy may have spunk, growth, and ambition, but it sure isn’t yet the graceful swan of an economy that it hopes to be. Thus, I found the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman to be humorously out of line when she asked the EU this week to reconsider China’s market status.  She later told the China Daily that the EU’s decision was “unfair.”   Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue alleged Tuesday that China’s status as a market economy is a “matter of fact” but why then is her country’s economy one of the most unpredictable and risky so-called markets competing in the world today?  I’ll give it to Zhang that many of the most inefficient aspects of Chinese central planning have been eliminated since 1978 (albeit it slowly and reluctantly), but the jury is still out on whether China’s economy will overheat in the coming years.  The remaining central planning elements of the Chinese economy are definite contributors to this imminent threat.  The EU cited four specific reasons for turning down Chinese official’s pleas.  First of all, China needs to reduce its overall state influence in the market by freeing up prices, etc.  Next, they need to increase corporate governance in order to quell corruption and increase compliance with accounting law.  China also needs to improve the integrity of its bankruptcy and property right laws as well.  Finally, they need to liberate their financial sector by opening up the Chinese capital market.  You don’t need to be an expert on the Chinese economy or its government policies in order to see the difference between a market economy and the Chinese.  In fact, you don’t even need to major in economics.  I learned in my high school economics class the basic components for a market economy.  One of which was a strong legal system to ensure and uphold private property rights. Right now, corruption in the courts and government officials does not guarantee anyone their rights especially to intellectual property which has been making headlines in China recently.  Another key element to the market system is a transparent financial sector which accurately gauges prices and has  interest rates, amongst other things.  I would be curious to hear what Zhang would say about China’s central ownership of the banking system, its repeated bailouts of state-owned enterprises, and alarmingly high non-performing loan rate.  Zhang did allege that the market is predominantly in control by telling the Associated Press that “The private sector makes up ‘a considerable part of the national economy’” and that “‘Some statistics show that the prices of 90 percent of goods are set by the market.’'' I think the operative words there are “considerable” and “some.”  It depends on who you ask and how they spin it.  But as far as the West is concerned China may have potential, but it is still the ugly duckling of the world economy and no one wants to claim it.    I would love to see China walk the walk instead of just quacking the quack, if you know what I'm saying.  I do think that they are making progress, but they're not quite there yet.  I don't profess to be an expert, so I welcome ya'll's opinions...Let me know what you think.

      Last night, John Coleman listened to me give my schtick about the basic difference between liberals and conservatives, loosely defined, on topics of religion in politics.    That difference is simple. One side sees religion as a fundamentally good force in the world, while the other sees it as something that must be shielded against as if it poses a threat.   urlLink "Pilgrim's Progress: John Kerry's dubious approach to religion"  by Steven Waldman (Mike, any relation?) deserves a very careful read.  The article touches on some key points about the constituents of the Republican and Democratic parties.   Excerpt:  "In general, most Republicans and most Democrats are pretty religious. The stark differences are at the extremes of each party, and, as so often is the case, the big question is whether the extremes will define the party as a whole. Most Republicans aren't conservative fundamentalists, although it sometimes seems that way given the proclivities of the leadership. And the Democrats have their own version of that same dilemma, and it's affecting the most important arena there is—this year's presidential race: Will Kerry's Democrats act like the Party of Secularists even if they aren't?"  I would contest that secularists have much greater power over the Democratic party than fundamentalists do over the Republican party. Although people who believe in biblical teachings more often support Republican policies, the support behind those policies is not rooted in religion. Take any official Republican policy and pose the question "does the party advocate this because some Bible-beater told it to?" The answer is patently and repeatedly no. The overarching rationality for Republican policies is reason and not religion. Yes this is even true for our favorite abortion-related wedge issues and gay marriage. (This is not to say that people can't disagree with that reason on their own terms). In sum, saying the Republican party is controlled by religion is like saying that the Heritage Foundation is a church, Fox News its scripture, and Rush Limbaugh its priest.  On the other hand, if you ask Democrats why they oppose allowing religious nonprofits, which serve a secular purposes such as feeding the homeless in environments which are required to offer a secular alternative, to compete on an level playing field for government grant money, they will give you some murky answer about well, "I just don't think that government money should go to churches." In saying so, they pronounce this last word with a certain disdain. Furthermore, opposition to indirect funding of religious, private schools has been the second largest obstacle to voucher programs, next to teacher's unions. In sum, Democratic policy is more controlled by the secularist left than Republican policy is by the "religious right".  Labeling one side or the other is unproductive, anyway. We should focus instead on policy and not on pigeonholing one side as "the religious right" or the other "the anti-religious left."  Back to the article...  Another interesting point raised in this article is that the African American voting block is much more "religious" than many people from the so-called "religious right".  A great line from the article was, "if John Kerry is uncomfortable with religion, then he's uncomfortable with Americans."  John Kerry is the type of man who will use his religion (or lack thereof) any which way he can to get elected, so I don't doubt that he will figure out how to say the right things.    While I am on a church-state related issue, check out  urlLink my tribute to Reagan , which was published in Campus Philly. I juxtaposed Reagan's state-run funeral with the attack on the Pledge of Allegiance by the ACLU and atheist Michael Newdow. If something frivolous like "under God" makes the Pledge unconstitutional, then state-run funerals for presidents with clergy giving eulogies must be too.    In case anyone is wondering, I don't consider myself a "religious" person. I haven't gone to church or said a prayer in a while, but I do believe in God.

      With all of the faith in religion talk that went on yesterday, I thought I'd bring up another inspiration point...our faith in the libertarian way.  urlLink Julian Sanchez   brings up a really good point in his latest blog. He asks, do we believe in low taxes and small government because we are libertarians? Or are we libertarians because we believe in all of those things, for what Julian calls "independent reasons?" I think the Koch Fellows are a perfect example of this. Often, we reach the same conclusions, but for very different reasons. That only enriches our debate. So bring on the drama Koch-heads...

And if parents can’t do their job, if parents can’t regulate what their children wear, then there should be a law.   This is real funny, but it is also real scary.  Maybe we should just have a country-wide dress code.

      Fabio, the masquerade is over.  Come out and fess up to what you are: a liberal.  Stop trying to fake everyone out and claim that you are basically a libertarian, because next to nothing you write exudes libertarian ideals.  As for anyone who actually toiled through Fabio's posts, be sure to read my post below on "abortion" and "gay marriage" and the 2004 presidential election.  Fabio does not argue any specifics but rather pontificates in vague generalities before taking the leap of faith to tell people that they should vote for John "Whiskey Dick" Kerry.  My post, on the other hand, expresses the nuances of two specific issues.  Fabio denouncing the "relgious right" only demonstrates Fabio's anxiety toward anything religious.  The Republican party is not controlled by the "religious right" anyway, but instead by the "rational right" that rejects the irrationality of the left.  As for the influence of religion on politics, any sect of Christianity splits more evenly Republican and Democratic than does Judaism, but does Fabio translate that constituency into a license to call them the "religous left"?  No, he sure does not.  His "corporate welfare" charge is unsubstantiated garbage and claims that the Democrats are "open" are false.  But since he did little to reinforce his remarks, I will save those topics for another day.

      While I agree with Fabio's "pragmatic" approach to libertarianism, I could not disagree more that the Democrats are about laisez-faire social policy. That's like saying that Republicans are for laisez-faire capitalism. Maybe in some abstract ideal, that's what the two parties stand for (at least that's their mantra) but the reality is quite different.   I wouldn't call the support for Teacher's Unions and the failed state of education in this country a laisez-faire approach to social issues.   I wouldn't call increasing welfare and Medicare laisez-faire. To me that translates explicity to Democrats taking a  specific  stance on a social issue. And for that matter, civil rights. What right does the government have to insist that a private indivuidual must hire or admit a token percentage of nth degree ethnicities to paint a picture of diversity? That sounds like taking a stance and making a subjective decision on what to and what not to do regarding social issues. Civil rights is not about laisez-faire.  If the question is about gay rights (which I think is where many libertarians identify with the Democratic Party) I would offer the critique that working within a government that defines a social issue by increasing the number of people involved in that issue (hence allowing gay as well as straights to marry) is not in any way keeping the government out of defining morality. If anything, gay marriage, at least the way the Democratic Party has approached the issue, is explicity defining morality no differently then how Republicnas are in their call for a Marriage Constitutional amendment. It's just the reverse conclusion. I believe, and I think any libertarian would agree, that marriage is a contract between two people with NO role for a government.  So I would offer the opposite opinion that voting for a Democrat is better than voting for a Republican. I can't make my mind up yet on the election (at the moment I am leaning towards Kerry because of the whole CATO argument of divided government), but I still identify with the Republican Party more at least in principle because I think that it is impossible to ever have social liberty without economic liberty. If the government controls the economy, it will inevitably control mass opinion. And conversely, if the government has no role in the economy, inevitably the freedom and individualism afforded in the market place will translate into a freedom of ideas and morality in social issues.  Therefore, I respectfully dissent.

       1. Vote Democratic    I've long said that I am a libertarian in a pragmatic sense.  That is, I generally see things from a libertarian point of view, but recognize that political realities often obstruct full libertarianism from flowering.  It is for this reason that I would not vote for the Libertarian party in an election; it's impractical because (though I hate to say it) a libertarian president simply will never happen in the current political reality.  So, in the current political reality, what is a libertarian to do?    I say, vote Democrat.    Ultimately, libertarian fiscal policy is not inline with either party, nor is it in line with the fiscal politics of a majority of the nation.  Though Republicans claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility (and apparently spend less than Democrats) the reality is both parties spend fairly irresponsibly; where their spending differs is, I think, measured solely on where the money goes.  Here's a quick translation of spending:  Republicans: $20 million Airline bailout Democrats: However-many-millions on Welfare  Put that in the Spending-Translator and you get:  Republicans: Corporate welfare Democrats: Social Welfare  I will not presume to make a judgment as to which one is more or less important, or more or less harmful.  I will say, however, that, though this is a grand oversimplification, there is a lot of truth to it.  Moreover, though Democrats may spend more empirically, generally their policies effect a greater number of people (because they are, after all, social entitlements, not corporate ones), proportionally, I am willing to posit that the numbers balance out a little more evenly.  Socially, however, the libertarian laissaz-faire attitude is far more similar to the social openness espoused by Democrats than it is to the religiously-based conservatism of the right.  Democrats tend to take things a bit far, fringing rational arguments about social liberty with arguments about entitlements; that is a problem for another day.  But, ultimately,  la societe laissez-faire  exists with more purity and freedom in the social politics of the Democratic party.   2.  Raid Nader   Going off what I've already said about pragmatism, I see no reason for third party voting, particularly for Nader.  I feel that every vote cast is a vote not thrown away, even if the candidate is never elected.  But how I  feel  is about as politically relevant to electoral politics as Anna Nicole Smith is to a drug-free existence.  Indeed, when it comes to practical matters of change, it is, in my opinion, best to side with one of the major political parties.    Often, I find that the problem with the extreme left or extreme right is not that they don't have good ideas, it's that they don't know how to market them; they want too much, too soon.  For people like Nader, I think the best way to effect change in the direction of their politics is to work from within a particular party, to use incrementalism to push for small-change-now, instead of getting no-change-now.   3.  Kill TV   On a completely different topic, here's a little something on everyone's favorite idiot box, once again arguing that  urlLink TV Sucks .

      In Shoaf's latest blog, he vastly oversimplifies the social issues that are in play during the 2004 presidential election.  This is a common mistake that the general population makes all too often.  There are many more social issues at stake than soley "abortion" and "gay marriage".  If you are deliberating between Bush and Kerry on social issues alone, you also have to ask if you want to have more nanny-state, environmentalist-activist social regulations, such as the cell phone bans which Coleman pointed-out and toilets that won't flush, and you also have to ask whether you want to be subjected to racial preferences, a radical secularist agenda, and "social justice" policies out the waazooo.  Kerry is a nightmare on all of these fronts.     Now to digress to the main point of this blog.  The terms "abortion" and "gay marriage" are ambiguously thrown around much, too much, to do justice to the actual, nuanced debate on more specific issues that exists today.  Where we stand on "abortion" and where we stand on "gay marriage", would more appropriately be considered where we stand on "abortion-related policies" and where we stand on "gay marriage issues".  If what you mean by "abortion" is overturning Roe, then people need to realize that even with Bush in office, Roe will not realistically be overturned in near future for a number of reasons.  First let's have a little historical background.  Justice Blackmun, a Nixon appointee, wrote Roe.  O'Connor, Souter, and Kennedy all Republican appointees vote to uphold it.  A significant percentage of registered Republicans and Republican officials are pro-choice.  The bottom line is that Republican appointees, and Republicans in general are far more pro-choice on the whole than what's written in the Republican platform and just because Bush might get a chance to make some appointments, doesn't mean that his appointments will overturn Roe.   If Bush does get the chance, the most oft-speculated as the next to retire is Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  Rhenquist is the most staunch, pro-life presence on the court, and Bush would have difficulty replacing and would be loath to do so for obvious political reasons. Political concerns, along with Generational and demographic ones, not to mention fervent Senate filibustering, would be exceedingly prohibitive to appointing an equivalent justice.   White House Counsel (Bush's top legal advisor at present) Alberto Gonzalez, who demonstrated pro-choice inklings while presiding on the Texas Supreme Court, is widely considered to be Bush's top choice to fill any court vacancy, and become the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice.  Ironically, Bush could very well appoint someone who could acutally strengthen Roe!   Next in line to become Chairman of the Senate Judiciary is Republican R.I.N.O, Senator Arlen Spector from Pennsylvania, who is unabashedly pro-life.  The Chairman and the committee have more influence over nominations than Bush, himself.  This means that, if they don't approve of a Bush appointment, then the appointment is pretty well screwed as evidenced by Miguel Estrada, Charles Pickering, Janice Brown, and the list goes on.  Democrats and "pro-choicers" have been applying an ideological litmus test and there is no way that they would let too many, if any, justices through to the Supreme Court, who would upset the balance of the court on this fragile issue to the breaking point.  People need to realize, ABORTION AINT GOING ANYWHERE!!!   Not Only is Roe not in danger, but the court as a body has repeatedly indicated that it is not looking to readdress Roe, regardless of what individual justices think about the abortion.    Again, the bottom line is that the right to an abortion will not be endangered by Republicans or President Bush any time soon, so pro-choiceers can vote for Bush and everyone else can be free to abort as many unwanted preganancies as they so desire.   Why do you you ask then, does John Shoaf and so many other Americans make the mistake of thinking that the basic right to an abortion is in jeopardy?  The answer is the pro-abortion lobby is much, much, more heavily funded and heavily staffed (as compared to the pro-life lobby), and is more widely accepted (though not by any means mainstream).  The pro-abortion lobby and pro-choicers in the media rountinely use scare tactics to cow pro-choicers into voting for Democrats, even though "Abortion" is not really at issue.  Without the pro-abortion lobby, Democrats are without one of their most effective lobbies, and without misinforming the public that abortion is constantly "under-siege", the pro-abortion lobby is out of a job.  As for what is really at issue, I support everything Bush has done so far reagarding abortion, which could be considered "pro-life" initiatives.  He signed the bill to ban 3rd-trimester, partial-birth abortions, the Unborn Victims of Violent Crimes Act to increase the penalties for those who commit crimes against pregnant mothers, has vowed not to employ a litmus tests (as in a pro-life one) on judicial appointments, has upheld the principle that the government shouldn't fund abortions, and has supported a loose form of parental notification for minors.  To the glee of diehard "pro-lifers", polls indicate that a majority of Americans also agree with these common sense "abortion restrictions", as they are sometimes called.  So in conclusion on the topic of abortion, whether you are "for" or "against" abortion is not the question you should be asking yourselves.  George Bush is the more logical vote for the vast majority of voters, pro-lifers and common sense pro-choicers alike.  I am for Bush's "abortion-related policies" fervently over Kerry's.  Moving on to Gay Marriage.  I take Jonathon Rauch's point of view-that the country's stand on gay marriage should not be coerced by an activist court, but rather left-up to the states and more democratic legislatures and referendums.  As I see it, there are two main issues at stake right now 1) Activist Courts 2) The Proposed Constitutional Ammendment.    The constitutional ammendment is not a threat, because it doesn't stand a chance of being ratified.  Any serious political analyst would agree.  Rather, the ammendment is merely reactionary, posturing, a direct reaction to the activist judges in Massachusetts.    If the ammendment did pass, which it won't, then it wouldn't "ban" gay marriage either.  It would merely enunciated that nothing in the Constitution can be interpreted to necessarily allow for gay marriage.  Then, it would again be left-up to states to decide the issue, but this time without the threat of coercive legislation from the bench.  Activist judges on the other hand are threatening, and not just on gay marriage, but also on a whole other wide array of issues.  If we elect Kerry, he will appoint activist judges and that would be very bad.  In conclusion, Elect Bush for two reasons, among many others:  1) He is the logical vote for "rational" pro-choicers, like myself.    2) He is better on gay marriage, even if you are accepting of it long term like I am, but realize that you don't want to have the issue dictated to us by some rogue judges in Massachusettes and realize that a new constitutional ammendment to ban it is pie in the sky.  If you have read this far, I thank you and I hope that it gives you new, more informed way of viewing the issues of abortion and gay marriage as they relate to the presidential election.  Vote George Bush in 2004!!

      If there has ever been a testament to the propagandist filth that is Michael Moore,  urlLink this is it.   So are we supposed to applaud China for letting its guard down for two seconds and importing an American documentary? I mean that's like saying that we should be proud that China is allowing its citizens to read Western books, when all those books include are Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto.   Not really an improvement.   But still, better than  urlLink Iraq.

      Earlier in the year I was set on voting for Gary Nolan, who was without question the best libertarian option.  Then the party made a foolish nomination, and I started to rethink things.  Once I calmed down and settled in a somewhat rational state, I started thinking about how foolish it would be to vote libertarian. The only way it makes since to vote libertarian is if one thinks a libertarian candidate is better than all the other candidates (i.e. that the primary candidates are EQUALLY worse than the Libertarian option).  Voting should be an expected value calculation...just like anything else. So, since I do not think Bush and Kerry are equally bad, I should probably vote for one of them because my vote will "count more" (this presumes that I have decided to vote and it ignores the futility/irrationality of voting arguments which I find quite persuasive). So, as a libertarian, I approve of Bush's tax policy and most of his labor policies. But I prefer Kerry's stance on gay marriage and abortion (in part because I do not think it is a government issue and in part because I think gays and women should have these rights...I know that is contradictory). It really comes down to evaluating whether economic policy or social policy is more important (I realize the two are often related and that candidates deviate from what you would expect their economic and social policy to be...but I ignore that for now because I am an economist and I can assume things). If I care more about the economy and about getting a good job, I should vote for Bush. If I care more about a women's right to choose and a gay's right to marry, I should vote Kerry. I suppose this all means I should vote for Bush because I am not gay and I do not anticipate getting an abortion or causing someone else to. Yet I am still very unsatisfied about the whole thing. Maybe I will write-in someone obscure (perhaps the great  urlLink Chris Sabo )...that might be the most fun of all, especially considering that my vote is not worth much anyway. I have a friend who votes for Hayek, and apparently, Michael Jordan gets about 6000 votes ever year.

      The  Washington Post  ran an  urlLink interesting article  this morning about a debate between Nader and Dean on whether or not Nader should run. Now, I know most of you don’t care to hear either of these men speak, unless they are overshadowed by your own angry, belligerent commentary, but I think it might be interesting for those people who are wondering about the viability of a third-party candidate. I, for one, am skeptical that the American majoritarian voting system can ever support a successful third party – and this is especially relevant for those of you who are thinking about voting for Michael Badnarik. Is voting for a third party actually going to make a difference (or change someone’s mind), or are you simply throwing away your vote?

      More shameless self-promotion reinforced by an ethos-grabbing Alex Potapov citation. Tonight I got incredibly fed up with  urlLink the idea of universal healthcare and blogged about it . Read the whole thing or this excerpt:    As I sat in the lower room of Vidalia restaurant in Washington, D.C. and watched Al Sharpton rant over closed captioning on CNN recently, I realized that something has gone terribly wrong with the Founders vision of America, with our grasp of logic, and with the basic language through which we Americans communicate our ideals. At some point in his speech (ironically enough, sometime before he quipped "read my lips, 'Our votes are not for sale'"), Sharpton made reference to the fact that universal healthcare was part of the American Dream--you know, that hope-filled policy that sent thousands floating to Ellis Island more than a century ago. That dream espoused by the Founders in the Declaration of Independence. You know, the American Dream--universal healthcare.  As I pondered Sharpton's turn of phrase, it struck me how nonsensical the phrase universal healthcare is--particularly as it is seen not only as a rhetorical tool, but a right. When asked why he is voting for George W. Bush in November, my friend Alex is fond of quipping, "Because universal healthcare is not a right." And while he is, in some ways, being funny, there is a lot of truth in that simple statement. Universal healthcare is not a right.   Also,  urlLink check out Ben Affleck . Jerk.

      For a summer intern and small town native, this past Friday, marked my first encounter with the HOV lanes of the DC metropolitan area.   After a full week’s work, eager to return home to spend time with my girlfriend, I hurried by metro rail to my northern Virginia apartment and readied myself for the drive, two hours north to Pennsylvania.  By the time I showered, packed, and bid my roommates good weekend, I was on the road around 5:30 P.M., hoping to make a long trip short.  Minutes later, I was abruptly stopped behind at least a dozen cars pulled-off to the side of the on-ramp along I-66 west.  Their occupants looked impatient and anxious to get where they were going, possibly to reach family or loved ones as in my case.    Wondering what the hold-up was all about, I rolled down my window and questioned a heavy set man sitting in a red car next to me.  He informed me about the HOV lanes and the general rule for route 66.  Single occupant drivers, I discovered, were not permitted on the highway during certain times of the day.    According to other commuters, tickets are routinely issued in a draconian fashion for non compliance.  Exorbitant fines of up to $5,000, provide law enforcement with a windfall of added revenue-raising opportunity and an incentive to be especially strict.  Commuters assured me that police look to ticket as many single-passenger drivers as possible and do not allow the slightest grace period for early drivers.  I even heard a horror-story rumor about police pulling over a pregnant woman, who had gone into labor and was trying to reach the hospital.  Inconvenienced, but still relatively unperturbed, I lined-up with the rest of the traffic.    Seeing the world through a political/public policy prism as I often do, I noticed a hint of irony in the situation.  This form of government regulation was unintentionally creating a form of the very problem it had set-out to prevent.  By limiting the free-flow of traffic on I-66, a defacto roadblock had created a new traffic logjam, exacerbating the traffic situation.    As if congestion wasn’t enough, my fellow commuters sat waiting with their air conditioners cranked-up and their engines idling.  I quipped to myself that this could likely raise the ire of many of the same people most prone to over-regulate highway usage.  Because idled engines meant wasted fuel, that meant, gasp…greater fuel emissions, than if people had been allowed to proceed freely.  Somewhere environmentalists were probably losing sleep over all this.    I continued to do my best to avoid the growing mental irritation from the unexpected delay.  Nevertheless, as an active person, I live by the maxim- time is money.  But this is not always quite so easy, especially, when one’s intent is getting somewhere to see a loved one.    In this case though, it wasn’t solely a factor of the opportunity cost of my wasted time.  Wasted gas from our air conditioners and idled car engines cost money too, meaning we, the idled commuters, would pay for the unfortunate layover at the pump.  That’s ok though, I continued to reassure myself, I’m only going to be waiting here for about 25 minutes, so it shouldn’t cost me all that much…or should it?  Gas prices vary dramatically across the nation.  More “liberal”, typically urban centers and neighboring, more-densely-populated, wealthier, suburbs can experience astronomical costs of living relative to the rest of the country.    Prices at the pump are no different in that they are often noticeably higher in these “bluer” areas as a result of higher gas taxes, inflation, environmentalist obstruction to new oil refineries, and more stringent, some might say overbearing emissions standards, which require “cleaner” burning blends and create gas shortages.    Much to my chagrin, Washington D.C. is a prime example of this phenomenon.  I was reminded of the drastic price disparity, twenty-five cents per gallon to be exact, between my hometown in Carlisle, Pennsylvania (30 minutes west of Harrisburg) and Washington, D.C.  Too stubborn to absorb the additional gas charge and a tiny bit disgusted by it all, I frugally shut-off my engine, resigning myself to bake in the beltway sun.    	Unlike Amtrak, to the extent that the Washington Metro is able to remain financially solvent without raising taxes or fares for the third consecutive year (which is improbable) and even though the Washington Metro is subsidized in large part by federal monies raised on the backs of millions of hardworking Americans across the country who will never benefit from MetroRail, I felt glad to have it available for my usual daily commute.    	Americans outside Washington DC (and New York, Boston, and similar urban areas for that matter) are more likely to own their own cars and more free to drive themselves wherever they want, when they want, maybe even by themselves, if they want.  Beltway-types have ceded a degree of individual freedom to drive to work in the morning and in general, to transport themselves as they please.  For some commuters, the Metro system must not only be viewed as a convenient option, but also as the dominant option, which indirectly crowds out other options, such as driving a car to work.    Furthermore, people outside these places don’t have to contend with crippling parking taxes (18 % in New York), massive expanses of no parking areas and parking meters, other parking fees, higher taxes on automobile purchases, higher car insurance, greater-regulation and tax-induced higher gas prices, severe traffic congestion, and other obstacles that make owning and utilizing one’s own car and individual mobility much more problematic and costly in these more liberal areas.  This HOV example is one illustration of some of the unintended consequences that government intervention in the public’s transportation systems, and the free flow of goods and capital, can have; although other examples abound.  In certain areas, speed limits are unnecessarily restrictive.  In New Jersey, drivers are not permitted to pump their own gas, because it as seen as a “safety hazard” (don’t ask me to try to explain this one).    New Yorkers and Democrats in Congress (and most recently the District of Columbia) have sought to outlaw cell phone use, while driving.  Never mind that the risk of cell phone use while driving is negligible, that other driving related activities are more risky, that reckless driving is already illegal, precluding the need for an additional statute.  Never mind that such a law would be unenforceable, hurting only the most law-abiding among us, or would become another facile, revenue-raising opportunity for hyper-vigilant law enforcement.    New research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration even suggests that  urlLink requiring hands free sets in lieu of regular cell phones is as dangerous, if not more so to drivers .  This is because the study shows that the danger (negligible though it may be) lies not in the act of holding the phone, but rather in the distraction from talking on it, effectively negating the difference between the two modicums.  The study goes on to posit that the hands free movement might have actually put more people at risk by inadvertently encouraging more talking while driving.     The overall point of this article is that, the stealthy hand of a concentrated government creeps a little further over America’s automotive liberty each and every year.  So next time you are driving, hopefully somewhere far away from a “freeway” in Washington, take a moment and revel in just how free you’ve got it.

      Even a Badnarik voter like me was distressed at the whitewashing of the post-Democratic convention coverage.  As many junkies know (and as many news sources reported up to the convention), presidential candidates often get a "bounce" in the polls after their official nomination, usually around 10 percent or so.  Every poll conducted after the Democratic convention has Kerry with a bounce anywhere between zero and 4 points -- a disaster, it seems, historically.  After all, even Michael Dukakis had a convention bounce.  But that's not what I read in the papers yesterday and today.  The articles almost uniformly crow about Kerry's minor bounce, with almost no mention that it is a woeful underperformance, historically.  USA Today, which actually ran an article reporting "no bounce for Kerry," (their poll had Kerry down a point after the convention) blamed the "intensely partisan" race rather than Kerry and his platform, or his awful convention speech.  Imagine if President Bush lost ground after the Republican convention; what would the headlines say then?  I rarely point a finger at the "liberal media," but in this case bad news for John Kerry is being reported differently than if it was bad news for George Bush.

      Moving to a more urgent issue for discussion...Did anyone go to see "The Village," by M. Shyamalan, this past weekend?  I went with John Coleman and Sara on Friday and the best part of the movie was hearing the two of them huddle together like school children in a tornado bunker, whimpering, "Oh my god...." and "Ohhhh Sh#t.....," every two minutes, in reaction to the "suspense" on-screen.  (To be fair to both of them, we did suffer this huge-ass ceiling fan blowing cold air onto us, giving us goose bumps before the movie even started.  However, my knowledge of some of John's living habits prevented me from seeking comfort in his bosom.)  Anyway, what should we make of M. Shyamalan and his movies?  Is this guy really a genius for manipulating audiences with simple and straightforward plot-twists that are carefully hidden until his chosen moment of revelation?  I won't spoil the secret behind "The Village," but it's really not that clever and leaves you feeling like you've been jipped out of a good-ol' TERROR-FRIGHT, which is presumably what we've all come for.  Beyond that, his movies are slow (meaning boring and without the sophistication/realism that sometimes compensate in other flicks), the adults talk and behave like straight-up weirdoes, the children are imbued with uncanny powers of wisdom and act like geriatrics, and everything else is unlike anything I recognize from real-life or other forms of art.  In short, there's no terror, no laughs, no realistic-profundity, and nothing else that I would deem "entertaining".   The only thing to take away from these movies is an appreciation for how M. Shyama plays everyone like a fool (without entertaining!) and how dumb we are to pay money to be on the receiving end.   --Tim Dorsett

      In continuing with my rant about Metro from last week...  If you didn't see this ridiculous Post  urlLink article  from last week, check it out. A lot of debate has been spurred on the Post's Opinion pages because of it.   It just deepens my belief that Metro needs to privatize part if not all of its operations.  I mean, when nice restaurants require ties and jackets, some may complain that it is stuffy, but everyone recognizes that it is the owner’s prerogative to set such standards and they must comply in order to be served. But when the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority asks riders to please refrain from eating or drinking, people like Stephanie Willet see no harm in finishing their candy bar before swiping their card to ride the train (see original  urlLink article ). They certainly do not expect to be taken to jail for finishing their mouthful and even disposing of the trash in the proper receptacle!  What’s the difference in the two scenarios? It is the tragedy of the commons. Public goods are taken for granted and thus not treated with the same level of respect that private property usually commands. In a private establishment, you would expect the manager to either ask Ms. Willet nicely to please refrain from bringing food down the escalator in the future or maybe even denied her use of the train that day. However, when the state owns the metro station, they have to create their own police authority, the Metro Transit Police, to force customers like Ms. Willet to comply with rules and respect the public property.  As WMATA’s budget problems and customer dissatisfaction increases and instances like Ms. Willet’s become more frequent (see the Post’s July 9 archived article, Metro Expects More Deficits), consideration should be given to the privatization of the Metro system. The unprecedented negotiation of a private contract with Bechtel Corp. and Washington Group International is definitely a step in the right direction, but the WMATA was hesitant to contract even for this job. Maintenance and management services could also be contracted out in order to improve metro services. Privatization would not only save money but also increase customer service standards by giving both customers and employees the incentives to behave respectfully.

      " urlLink Democrats hail working stiffs, but party on corporations' tab " is a great article, which points out how that the lavish parties attended by delegates at the DNC Convention are in stark contradiction to the Dems' supercharged, populist rhetoric. To some extent, the Koch Fellows are "partying" extravagantly and enjoying a great experience in DC thanks to Republicanesque money from the Koch Foundation.  Just today, I was informed by the Chair of the Young Conservatives of Pennsylvania that a Democratic legislator in PA is trying to enact legislation to ban smoking in bars (similar to what was done in other liberal strongholds such as NYC and how Dems support regressive "sin" taxes on cigarettes) for over-inflated "health/safety concerns".  A similar thing happened this past year at the University of Pennsylvania. Its more liberal/Democratic student government, banned smoking in dorms on campus.  Conservatives, more so than liberals, support smokers' rights. Business interests (largely Republican) want to be able to cater to customer preferences and the tobacco industry (which supports Republicans), doesn't want to be unfairly targeted at the expense of basic individual freedom and personal liberty, which is really what this issue is all about.  From a state-run liquor control board in PA, which is dominated by Democratic labor unions and which causes the prices of liquor to be much higher and less available than in neighboring states, to dance clubs that have had to be shut down because of reckless lawsuits from more likely-to-be Democratic trial lawyers, to fireworks (think fourth of July) which are much more regulated, if not banned, in liberal northeastern states, than they are southern ones, such as Alabama and South Carolina, to liberal attacks against university Greek life as being discriminatory, misogynist, and non-inclusive; on more than just these issues, the conservative view is the more party-friendly position.  This is somewhat ironic, because liberals are generally stereotyped as being bigger partiers/more fun-loving than "up-tight" conservatives. Though liberals may be bigger partiers on the whole, I would seriously contest on a whole range of issues that conservative policies are more party friendly.  Younger, party-concerned voters (not just the political ones) should realize that the Republican Party is the best party in town.  urlLink

       urlLink Interesting article  in the Christian Science Monitor about the gender gap experienced by many American colleges and universities.    "It's wrong to put your thumb on the scale for a male applicant when you've got a better-qualified female, but I know the colleges are doing it because they've told me," says Thomas Mortenson, a policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Opportunity and Higher Education in Washington.  A Midwestern college president who asked not to be named agreed, saying that some colleges he knows well admit men at higher rates even though "women are usually the stronger candidates." ....  "We could possibly enroll an entire class of women - our pool of women applicants is that strong," he says. "We could not enroll a whole class of men, because we don't have enough strong male candidates."    Admissions offices are struggling for balance, and many resort to raising acceptance rates for male candidates in order to reduce the gender gap. I'm interested to see how this affects affirmative action supporters' arguments that AA is necessary for diversity's sake. Clearly, few supporters of AA will rush to ensure that more men are placed in top colleges. Maybe this will reveal the diversity question as the distraction it is, and force the debate to focus on the real question: whether AA is a good means to address past or present systemic discrimination.  By the way, this is a very serious problem at  urlLink my school .
