      Wow, today is Friday.  I am so glad this week is over.  It has been short, but crazy and hectic enough to make up for it.  When in my life did I have to start looking forward to the weekends to get me through the week?  I heard a great story on NPR that really got me energized this morning.  Apparently in DC they are doing an updated version of "Fidelio".  I think it is one of my favorite operas because it is the first one I saw live, and because I just love Beethoven.  This opera deals with issues that other operas of its time didn't try to.  I will say that musically, it isn't all that great, but the subject matter is what it's all about.  The story is  urlLink here  if you'd like to listen.  It is amazing how relevant that opera can be to our situation today.  Who knew? I guess liberty, freedom (intellectual and otherwise), and unfair imprisonment are issues that have never gone out of style.  CD of the day: Shakira,  Laundry Service .  Listening to it in my car this morning I wondered, why did I like this CD?

      I forgot to mention my dream -- I dreamt last night, among other things, that Dolly Parton was putting on a continous show in town, and that I got to hang out with her.  She was really nice and much shorter in person.  So she was here for a while and her crew loved it here, but she got called to be either be a) a judge or b) on some variety show.  I can't honestly remember, but I was very upset at her for leaving.  I take this as a sign that I have listened to  The Grass is Blue  too many damn times.  Ah well - when I watched  General Hospital  regularly (it's been a while now), the characters would always be in my dreams.  I'm glad that doesn't happen anymore.  Gosh, that show went to crap real fast.  And it won a best writing emmy? What the hell?

      I go to Common Dreams and find this  urlLink article  about U.S. soldiers shooting at an Iraqi wedding party.  Reading about the forced curfew, it hit me.  Does this remind anyone else of a similar period of time when certain people were under enforced curfews? I mean, the attacking of the wedding party is straight out of  Fiddler on the Roof !! Where is the UN?   And when will our Democrats react like these  urlLink Brits ?  It frustrates me what we Americans are letting Bush and his cronies get away with.  Lord knows if Clinton had tried this, the Republicans would have attacked him like *that*!

      I got the bookshelves from J, and she also gave me two end tables.  I think my Walmart furniture is slowly being faded out.   urlLink those fiesty Texans .  I watched the new show  Fame  last night.  I totally got into it.  I can't believe Joey Fatone is co-hosting it! He's actually better than Ryan Seacrest, but then, that doesn't take much.  All I have to say to that Mackenzie girl who sang "Don't Rain on My Parade" is - don't try to be Barbra, and pull your hair back.  CD of the day: Elton John,  Greatest Hits, 70s - 00s .  Where is Kiki Dee nowadays anyway? =)

      I have discovered  urlLink Friendster  and if you were my friend, you'd go and sign up.  But seriously, folks - it is a neat concept, even though it shows me only having one friend.  Thank you, Alice! It's not my fault all my friends don't want to meet new people.  Or they're seriously dating someone.  Sheesh.  Why does today feel like a Monday? Is it because we got Monday off? But if that is true, then why wasn't yesterday like this? People are calling in with crazy orders, wanting 3-year old transcripts yesterday.  I hate to tell them no, but sheesh!   and I think I really am getting J's bookshelves today.  It doesn't look like rain, so this is very promising.  CD of the day: Peter Gabriel,  Up .  Peter Gabriel = the best there is.  And if you haven't seen "Rabbit Proof Fence" yet, go get it, b/c his soundtrack is AWESOME.  I'm only a little biased. Really.   urlLink I'm not really surprised.

      Blogger is telling me that I can't change my template. =( How annoying.  It was really nice to have a long weekend.  I got to talk to my friend S in Winona, MN, who I haven't talked to in a few months.  He's doing well, so that's good.  We talked for a few hours.  I rarely talk that much on the phone.  I talked to him, did some extra work and watched "Trading Spaces".  I'm trying to get K to do the new TLC show "For Better or For Worse".  That would be so cool.  CD of the day: Tori Amos,  Scarlet's Walk .  What a great CD, no bad song on it.

      I had a meeting last night that went from 6:30 until 8:45.  Ack! Fortunately, snacks happened to be provided at this meeting, otherwise, I would have had to leave early.  Seriously.  B/c of the location, I have to go straight after work.  But no more! The next meeting we will start to meet in a more central location, with no squaredancing in the background.  I won't miss the calls in the background, let me tell you.  Last night we were discussing the financial report and the squaredancers were dancing to "Elvira".  It was so hard to concentrate while that songs was on.  Anyway, I ramble.  As I'm sure you know by now, reporter Chris Hedges was booed off the stage at the Rockford College commencement.  I didn't realize that Rockford was where Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, graduated from college.  In this  urlLink interview  on Alternet, he discusses what he witnessed at the commencement:  "As I gave my talk and I looked out on the crowd, I was essentially witnessing things that I had witnessed in the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina or in squares in Belgrade or anywhere else. Crowds, especially crowds that become hunting packs are very frightening. People chanted the kind of cliches and aphorisms and jingoes that are handed to you by the state. "God Bless America" or people were chanting "send him to France" – this kind of stuff and that kind of contagion leads ultimately to tyranny, it's very dangerous and it has to be stopped.     "I've seen it in effect and take over countries. But of course, it breaks my heart when I see it in my country. That's essentially what I was looking at was in some ways a mirror of what I was trying to speak about. And I think I managed to touch upon it somewhat when I talked upon this notion of comradeship as a suppression of self awareness and self-possession to sort of follow along, locked in the embrace of a nation, or of a group, or of a national group unthinkingly, blindly. And there is a kind of undeniable euphoria in that. And that's what I was looking at."

      Yay, Ruben won.  I caught the tail end of the show last night to find out.    In  Harper's  this month, they publish the last e-mails that  urlLink Rachel Corrie  wrote her family.  I'm reminded of this because Commondreams.org has an article by Naomi Klein called  urlLink Why Two Women Went to War .  It is a sad thing that our nation celebrates the faux rescue of one while ignoring the death of another.  It probably has a lot to do with our current faux-President.  Tape of the day: Nat King Cole, songs I recorded off of KUT many years ago.  Yes, I should just buy a CD that will last longer, but the show really played a diverse range of his music.  I'll probably keep listening to the tape til it dies.  Which will probably be any month now.

      Oh - and the Modigliani exhibit was really cool.  I think my favorite pieces were "Alice" (a painting of a young brown girl with a cross around her neck), "Rose Caryatid with Blue Border" (he liked the idea of female figures holding great amounts of weight), a sketch he did of a young girl, and a painting by another Montparnasse artist entitled  urlLink "Sun, Tower, Airplane"  or something to that effect.  The last piece is very vibrant and cubist. To see more examples of Modigliani's work and to read about his life and other artists of Montparnasse, check out  urlLink Who is Modi?

      I feel a little more with it now.  Last night I was so tired that when I spoke, I made little sense.  When I get that tired, I mix up words and have to think really hard about what I'm talking about.  News on V's wedding: she's looking for a new venue.  The Baptist church said no "Ave Maria", so she's searching for a new place.  I get a new (to me) bookcase from my friend J tonight.  Exciting.  CD of the day: Michelle Branch  Spirit Room .  It's my sister's, and I like it so far.

      Okay, I am exhausted from driving all day, but there you are.  Two things:  1) I have joined a blog called  urlLink List of Lists , and we shall see how that goes.  2) I just finished watching  Gilmore Girls  (I had recorded it).  This episode just furthered my appreciation for the show.  The  Judging Amy  team could definitely learn a lesson on season finales from the GG team.  What a terrific show.  I just love it and am never disappointed with an episode.  Okay - time for sleep.  See you tomorrow.

      The continuing killings (serial and otherwise) of female  maquiladora  workers in Juarez is appalling.  Read about them  urlLink here .  This situation is not getting the attention it deserves.  The El Paso newspaper did a story on them a while ago that I link to on my  urlLink feminist page .  Why haven't these murders been solved yet? It's ridiculous.

      Okay, I realize I post a lot of links here.  And here's another one:  urlLink If Bush Was Popular, We Wouldn't Need Polls to Convince Us .  I couldn't have put it any better.  The basic gist of the article is that it is easier for a lot of Americans to not have to think about what Bush is doing than to research all he has done wrong.  See what you think.   I noticed this morning that the ads displayed on my page are currently wedding-related.  Very interesting, since this is certainly NOT a wedding-related blog.  Perhaps if I list the word music enough times I'll get some music-related ad.  Here's the test: music, music, music, music, music, music.     Tomorrow is my drive to DFW.  I'm glad to get a day off, but not too excited about being in the car all day.  At least my friend B is coming along.  I'll drive most of the day, and she'll take over after we drop my sister L off.  And we are making a stop at the Kimbell to see a Modigliani exhibit.  Whoo hoo, half price Tuesdays! I hope my plan works out and I don't feel rushed.  I like to take time at museums.  When I was in Minnesota, I spent a summer day at the Minneapolis Institute of Art.  Two reasons why: 1) It is an awesome museum, and 2) it was air-conditioned (my apartment was not).  I went through every room I was interested in and wrote in my journal about neat works and artists I wanted to remember.  That was a great day.  I especially loved their photography exhibit.  *sigh* I wish my city had a decent art museum.

      I've come to the decision that the only way I can get excited about doing housework is to put Latin music on.  For example, Putumayo's  Afro-Latino  is what I'm listening to now.  I figured I might as well vacuum after I got back fromm the gym, since I'm already sweaty and gross.     Tuesday I get to drive my sister to DFW airport.  She is flying to Australia.  I am slightly jealous.  I want to go to Australia, but not with a large group of people, like she is.  Anyway, she should have lots of fun.   More tomorrow.

      An extremely disturbing  urlLink article  on the use of DU by American troops in Iraq.  These awful tales I hear of current "post-war" Iraq disappoint me, because they prove that I was right in being against the war.  I knew that if we invaded Iraq, innocent people would die.  I have seen way too many pictures of Iraqi people, mostly children, wounded by cluster bombs to feel that our involvement was necessary.  I hated Hussein, sure.  But I am truly disgusted by the way America decided to ignore the UN.  I just know this will bring serious repercussions for us in the future.  *sigh* And I really hate how any anti-war protestor is labelled as being anti-troops.  Okay, that's enough about that. Go to the Monitor and see what you think.

      Well, the Killer Ds are back in town. Yay! And if you were wondering why the hubbub between the two parties, here's an explanation for you from the town pundit John Kelso:  urlLink You're likely a member of the GOP if. . .   It's a bit oversimplified, but I do think he's got the main idea right.  Hee Hee.  Enjoy.   CD of the day: my mix CD of Chicago's  Greatest Hits  and the Coors  In Blue .  You may think that seems a strange mix. . . but I think it flows rather well.  I did something weird when burning the CD and got the tracks all mixed up.  For the record - I own both of these CDs, and I'm not gonna sell my mix.  Just in case you're wondering.

      If this  urlLink article  is correct in its prediction, I will never watch  American Idol  again.  Now wouldn't that give me more free time?! Ruben deserves to win - he's the best, and everyone knows it.  If Clay wins, it won't be for talent.  I'm sorry, I took three and a half semesters of vocal lessons, and I can't stand the way he sings! Ack!  Of course, I wanted Kimberley Locke to make it to the top two, but I wasn't surprised last night.  Not at all.*sigh* Okay, now you all know I watch  American Idol .  I probably won't bring it up again, unless Clay wins.  Expect an angry rant in that case. =)

      I talked to K last night and apparently, V is having some issues planning the music for the wedding (yes, another friend is getting married. . .when it rains, it pours, you know).  She wants K to sing "Ave Maria", which is not an unusual request for weddings.  However, V is getting married in a Baptist church (she is Catholic) and her music has to be approved by the church! Isn't that ridiculous?!! The church planner asserts that "Ave Maria" is a "Catholic" song, and doesn't belong in a Baptist wedding.  Never mind that "Ave Maria" has been sung at weddings in her family for generations. . . It's okay for people to sing really bad versions of "I Hope You Dance" or "From this Moment" at a wedding, but not a beautiful version of the "Ave Maria".  Can someone explain that to me?  But we won't delve into my issues with the Southern Baptist church.  I don't think you have all day to read, and I know I don't have all day to type.  More  urlLink news  on the Killer Ds.    CD of the day:  urlLink Nickel Creek 's eponymous album.  Don't know what eponymous means? Go  urlLink here  for a clue.

      You know, I remember (was it 1996? or 1992?) when Al Franken and Arianna Huffington bantered on Comedy Central about the presidential candidates, and I thought she was nuts.  However, I have been reading her more recent stuff off of  urlLink Common Dreams  and  Alternet , and she is making so much more sense now.  I just found  urlLink this  off her site that explains what made her change her political standpoint, see the light, etc.  See? You can grow out of conservatism!

      Another neat  urlLink take  on the Killer Ds.   Question: what are the responsibilities of the maid of honor if there is a matron of honor too? Who is really in the place of honor? Do you share it? Can one sit back and enjoy the ride? and what do you get an acquiantance for a baby shower? I think I'll go with a card.  That's always a safe bet.

       Helen Thomas rocks;  urlLink read  what she has to say about Dubya and the way he's sent America down the wrong path where diplomacy is concerned.     I watched  Judging Amy 's season finale last night and was extremely disappointed.  I have watched this show since the first season, and find it hard to believe it went so low.  Is Gillian dead? Will Kyle stay sober? Will Amy work in criminal court? Will Amy *shudder* marry Stu? I understand that in the season finale you want to leave people hanging, but you also want to peak their interest.  I think that season finale just tells me to find a new show on Tuesday nights at 9.  After watching a neat episode of  Gilmore Girls ,  Amy  is just disappointing in comparison.  Okay, that rant is over.     CD of the day: Fleetwood Mac  The Dance .  I heard "Bleed to Love Her" on the  Alias  season finale and wanted to listen to it. . .

      I have never been so proud to be a Texas Democrat.  urlLink Here's why .  I have been getting e-mails from my county's Democratic party for a while now discussing the planned redistricting.  Evil Tom DeLay! I wish there was a better way the Republicans would listen to some sense, but I guess the Killer Ds did what they had to do.  Just for the record, I wrote a letter to Rep. Crabb at the start of all this.  I felt at least I could look back and say I did something.   Last night I got roped into helping my church-friend K.  So I got to watch "Shrek" and five school-kids while their parents attended K's parenting class.  Supposedly I get a meal for the Monday nights I've helped out.  Hmm.   CD of the day: I'm back to  Steady Pull  by Jonatha Brooke.  It's a relatively new CD for me, so I have to listen to it enough to memorize as many lyrics as possible, at least on the songs I really like.

Instant classic.   CD of the day: Tom Petty  Wildflowers .  Listening to it reminds me of high school.

Very exciting, since this will be the only wedding I'll be involved in in the near future.  Since I'm not involved with anyone, I don't see one happening too soon.  And that is okay.  I don't need a man to feel complete! It still would be nice to have one though. . .=)

       My dream last night - well, it was interrupted.  My newspaper is now being thrown onto my balcony, since it was stolen from in front of my door last Friday and Saturday.  So anyway - at 5:25 I hear this big thunk that wakes me from my pleasant dream.  I think someone is trying to break into my apartment.  I get up and check my locks, then remember about the paper delivery and assume all is well.  Of course, I can't get back to sleep for a few minutes.  I hate that.  When I do get back to sleep, it is only a half-sleep.  I am somewhat in control of my dreams.  It is strange, because I imagine myself in a thinner body.  Why? I am comfortable with my body-type! Overall, my dreams after that were stranger than normal, because I kept waking up, thinking my alarm was about to go off.  I must say, when my alarm finally did go off, I uttered, "Finally!" and got out of bed pretty quick.

I love their CDs, and a portion of their profits go to UN or other world non-profits.   Gotta love our  media  and their ignorance of the real left-over effects of this war.

        urlLink Again   Boondocks  is wonderful.    The A/C in the office isn't working.  This is not the best day for it to be off.  The stillness of the air doesn't help.  I've got the fan behind my desk on, so that will aid a little bit.    Last night I dreamed that I was in "Starship Troopers".  I haven't even seen this movie, so I don't know why I dreamed about it.  And of course, the scenario in my dream is different from anything that is in that movie, I'm willing to bet.  I wish I dreamed that I was in "Strictly Ballroom", because I did watch that DVD last night.  *sigh*    CD of the day: Soundtrack,  O Brother, Where Art Thou?

      So I just got back from my attempt to see the doctor.  I say attempt because although I got there in plenty of time (I filled out all the paperwork and got weighed in), my appointment was disrupted by a smoke attack.  I was waiting in the exam room, with one tennis shoe half-off, reading a poster on the many different versions of the Pill available, when someone popped into the waiting room and told us that we had to evacuate the building because of a large amount of smoke.  I put my shoe on and walked out the building with the doctor and her secretary, and we noticed the fire engine outside.  We thought we could go inside any minute now, until a Special Operations truck pulled up 25 minutes later.  The doctor asked if I just wanted to reschedule, and I finally agreed that would be best after waiting outside in the gross humidity for 40 minutes.  I actually wished I had a cell phone while waiting outside, since I can't really read  One Hundred Years of Solitude  standing in a misty parking lot.  I guess I'll have to make an appointment for later on this week.

      CD of the day: Erasure  Other People's Songs .  I'm not ashamed of my love of Erasure's music.  Yes, perhaps pop-techno's days are over, but I'll still buy their CDs.  This one has a great cover of "Solsbury Hill"(Peter Gabriel).

       A well-made  urlLink statement  by Senator Byrd:   "President Bush's address to the American people announcing combat victory in Iraq deserved to be marked with solemnity, not extravagance; with gratitude to God, not self-congratulatory gestures. American blood has been shed on foreign soil in defense of the President's policies. This is not some made-for-TV backdrop for a campaign commercial. This is real life, and real lives have been lost. To me, it is an affront to the Americans killed or injured in Iraq for the President to exploit the trappings of war for the momentary spectacle of a speech. I do not begrudge his salute to America's warriors aboard the carrier Lincoln, for they have performed bravely and skillfully, as have their countrymen still in Iraq, but I do question the motives of a deskbound President who assumes the garb of a warrior for the purposes of a speech."    Amen, Senator Byrd!

       Fifteen more minutes and I can go home! I have been wasting time at my desk here taking random web quizzes, such as "What kind of music are you?" and "What kind of thinker are you?" with mixed results.  I've been checking out other blogs, and I think mine is about in the middle.      I made an appointment to get my hair cut and highlit/lowlit this weekend.  It is driving me nuts.  I'm thinking of going with something completely different.  Yet - there is a limit to what can be done, since I refuse to blowdry my hair.  It is really strange.  Two years ago at this time I was in Minnesota working on basement forms, and now I sit at a desk, pondering my hair.  I'm not saying I've gotten shallow. . . just bored.   The youth are leading the service on Sunday.  I am excited, a)because they are going to do a great job, and b) because we won't have to plan the service anymore!    I will celebrate by going to see  A Mighty Wind  this weekend.  It is about freaking time it came to town!

      I am apartment-searching right now.  It is somewhat frustrating, since I can't move until my lease runs out in late July.  I am just so tired of my neighbors playing pumped-up bass music at midnight, getting monthly notices of another break-in at my complex, the beeping horns of people who can't get in the gate, the traffic at the intersection, etc.  I'd rather pay more for a quiet place that feels a bit safer.  Enough is enough.

      Well, I saw two great shows this weekend:   Xmen 2  and the  Alias  season finale.  Both were great, but  Alias  still has me thinking.  I love television that blows your mind.  Just when you think you know what to expect from a show, it throws you for a loop.  I am amazed at the writing of that show.  I mean, who thought of this? If any show is deserving of awards, it is this one, especially with that finale.  Whoo-ee.

      I think I am getting the hang of this blog thing.  I was trying to explain to my mom what blogger was, and she wondered why anyone would want to put their journal where everyone could read it.  I told her it could be used for a lot more than that, showing her  urlLink Alternet 's blog of current events.    I doubt I'll use this for anything as important as that, but it is a good example of a relevant blog.  I also like Tom Tomorrow's blog on his  urlLink page .

      At my parents house doing laundry.  It's a Sunday, what's new?  Last night I went to Kerbey Lane with M and we talked about Paris, Spain and all these other places I can't afford to go.  Apparently he is going to try for Loyola Law School after his fall sojourn in France at Monet's gardens.  Anyway, he told me that his cousin from Houston took her best friend to the airport on her way to Baghdad.  Her friend will be working there for a year, making a six-figure salary.  He looked at me and said, "She works for some Houston company, I can't remember what. . ." Jokingly, I said, "It's not Halliburton, is it?" He answered, "Yes! That's it!" and I burst out laughing.  Although it isn't really very funny.    Sidenote: Kerbey Lane Cafe has the best queso EVER.  I'm not lyin'.  No other anecdotes to relate.  Although - Genesis' "So This is the World We Live In" just popped into my head.  Does anyone else remember the video for that song? I remember it was one of the first ones I ever saw and it creeped me out.  I'm thinking about posting one of my cloud-inspired poems, I just haven't gotten around to it. . .  I'm off to start  A Portrait of a Lady  now.

      Last night I had a meeting that went from 6:30 to 9pm.  I'm glad I had an apple at work before I left, because otherwise, I would feel more guilty about just having ice cream for dinner.  Hey! I've gotta have something.  I feel strange about the meeting.  We only had a third of the board there (a quorum, yet) and we ended up discussing and voting on some BIG issues.  I'm wondering how the other members will feel when they find out. . . anyway, I took notes b/c the secretary isn't doing well health-wise right now.  I know my notes are not up to par with hers.  Ah well.  I started reading  The Dive from Clausen's Pier  right before I went to bed and am really getting into it.  The chapter I just finished ended with the narrator being asked to kiss her "boyfriend-in-a-coma" (well, okay, he's out of it and just had surgery, but I wanted to say it!).  His kissing her back was so descriptive, I almost felt it.  How strange.  I'm also trying to read  Portrait of a Lady , but haven't got too far.  No plans for the weekend except to get a car wash.  I am hoping I will hear from the apartment complex I visited last weekend soon.  I'm on a waiting list and wish I had a more concrete idea of where I might be.  I imagine I might hear something after this weekend.  As soon as I do, of course, I have to give notice to my complex.  I haven't quite figured out how I'm going to work it.  Moving, you know.  Last night I dreamt that my pal J was in this huge apartment and we were watching some random movie that doesn't exist.  All of a sudden I remember she dated Ashton Kutcher two years ago (which in reality, of course, she did not).  I tell her, "Isn't it strange that you dated him two years ago and now he's with Demi?"  I guess this goes to show that the media inundation is working.  Ack! I don't like either of them, since I believe neither can act very well.  Politics - MoveOn is supposed to have results at noon Eastern time today.  I'm really wondering if any candidate got over 50% of the vote.  But who knows?    As for Strom Thurmond passing, I have nothing nice to say, so I won't say a thing.  I could though, I really could.  And the anti-sodomy bill being voted unconstitutional - yay! But as for the justices who said this ruling promotes the homosexual agenda - I have one word to say.  Bulls**t.     And that's all about office-worker girl small. for now.

      I have been moved to the new Blogger.  Whatever that means.  I don't really have too much to write about.  K is out of range this week, so I have nothing to dish about.  J is deeply entrenched in barbri.  I haven't heard from anyone else in a while.  Although - apparently M just got back from Paris.  I think he is going back again sometime this summer or this year. . . I can't remember.  I wish I could go somewhere this summer.  The biggest plan I have is V's wedding, which I haven't gotten an invite for yet.  I've got to go somewhere soon.  I want to go to Minnesota and see some of my pals from my Americorps days.  They are all spread out up there now.  R is near Canada and S in Winona. . . but L is still in the Twin Cities area.  I miss them all.  It has been too long since I've seen them.  So who knows?   The other night I was driving home while listening to FOW's "Halley's Waitress."  I looked out my window at the clouds to the west and I just got this homesick feeling.  I don't know why.  I just felt this rush, as if the clouds reminded me of some good past experience.  Anyway, I got to my apartment and wrote a couple of poems, so I guess it was good inspiration. =)  CD of the day: still Guster,  Keep it Together .  It is great background music, but I should really take it out to my car (I'm still listening to FOW there).

      I went and voted on MoveOn today for who I want the PAC $$ to go to.  I find it interesting that on the same ballot they say, "who would you ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT" in the race for Prez.  I had to give it up for Dean, Kerry and Edwards.  They are the only candidates I can see being enthusiastic about, and I can just barely get excited about Kerry and Edwards.  Dean is my man, but who knows if he will get the nomination? I just know if Gephardt or Lieberman get the Democratic nom, I will support them, but I won't be very "enthusiastic" about it.  How are they different? They are all the same when you get down to it.  The same ol, same ol' Democratic party ain't gonna beat Bush.    On Tom Paine they mentioned a ABCNews poll that shows that Bush's support numbers haven't gone down too much.  I am amazed that they are taking this poll so seriously.  I learned in school that polls mean diddly-squat where politics are concerned, but our society is obsessed with them anyway.  This day is going by so slowly - the internet was down here all morning.  This taught me that I rely way too much on the internet to keep myself occupied at work.    CD of the day: Guster,  Keep It Together .  I love "Amsterdam".  That song is an instant fave of mine.  You can hear it on their  urlLink site .  I love the random mention of a Shaq CD.  Hee hee!

      I thought of  urlLink this song  upon receiving an email from a friend and have since had it in my head.  I don't think these lyrics I found are completely accurate - I believe the correct lyric is: "Jesus said Mother I couldn't stay another day longer Flies right by and leaves a kiss upon her face. . ." Anyway, the main lyric in my head has been: "You cast aside the sheets, you cast aside the shroud of another man, who served the world proud You greet another son, you lose another one on some sunny day and always (you'll) stay Mary. . ." I added the "you'll".  Patty Griffin is an awesome songwriter.  When I was on the Campus Activities Board of my school, we tried to get her to come, but she cost way too much for us.  Ah well.    The puppy is resting on the floor by the door until the UPS guy comes.  It's the cutest thing.  Just because she hangs out in the front area where my desk is people who don't know any better assume she's mine.  I don't have a puppy yet.  I probably won't for a few years.    Is it 5:30 yet?

      Two interesting finds today:  First is the American Apology Shirt, made for any current travelersto foreign lands, which states, "I'm sorry my President's an idiot.  I didn't vote for him" in six different languages.  Buy one for yourself or a friend  urlLink here .    The second is not such a humorous find.  Tom Paine led me to this  urlLink article  that is a basic summary of interviews with a few different American servicemen in Iraq.  I haven't had time to finish reading it (lunch is almost up), but am gravely disturbed by what I have read.  These men show no remorse for killing innocent civilians.  They are fueled by a deep hate.  Well, lunch is up.  Perhaps I'll have more time later to discuss this scary find.  CD of the day: the CD D made me.  Mellow yellow.

      Ok, everyone must see Ann Telnaes' cartoon today - go  urlLink here .  I love her style.  Notice the Saddam voodoo doll on W's desk. Ha! Just a nice little added touch.  I found  urlLink this story , thanks to Alternet.  The Washington Post gives an extremely indepth look at what really happened to Jessica Lynch.  A quote that standed out to me: "The doctors are reasonably sure," said Army spokesman Kiki Bryant, "that she does not know what happened to her." But the American government seems to know.  Don't they?  At my audition last night I was hit with the realization that my music-reading skills have much-declined.  So I didn't get into the group I wanted to, but instead will be with the huge group that sings oratorios.  Mozart's "Requiem", here I come!

       Maybe I should move to Canada. . .  Wow, this is faith week for me, ain't it? I am a practicing Presbyterian and I just found out about  urlLink this story  from Tom Paine.  The relationship between homosexuals and the Presbyterian Church has always been rocky.  As a rule (and as mentioned in the article), gay and lesbian people cannot be ministers in the Church because it goes against the rule that states that a minister must be either married or practicing chastity (ha!).  I have tended to be somewhat ambivalent on this issue; I just haven't known what to think.  But I think removing a preacher for performing same-sex marriages is going to far.   urlLink Canada is ahead of us on every front .  Locally, Governor Goodhair (Rick Perry) has officially called for a  urlLink special session on redistricting .  What can be done now? Are the Republicans even listening to their constituents? Ack!  Karl Rove, the great puppeteer, is to blame here.    Other than that, my day is going reasonably well. . . I am auditioning tonight for a local choral ensemble.  I hope it goes well!

      A few months ago I went to the Dallas area to see my pal K.  I went to church with my aunt, uncle and cousins that weekend.  I had been to their church before, and while it is much different from my liberal-Presbyterianism, it hadn't been too bad when I visited last.  This experience was different though.  This time we were at "war", and had to pray for the "President".  I felt sooo uncomfortable and I think I confused my cousins by my somewhat quiet sounds of dissent.  And to top all of this off, Priscilla Owen was visiting! She spoke IN THE CHURCH before the service started, to the congregation, as I wriggled in my seat.  At the end of her whiny speech (I'm not exagerrating - she sounded like she was about to cry the whole time she was speaking), the congregation gave her a standing ovation.  My cousins didn't know her background or who she was, and they stood and applauded til they saw I didn't.  I was the only person in the congregation who did not applaud for this woman.  I was so offended that such an obvious political character was asked to speak in church!  My aunt apologized afterwards, and I told her it was okay, it just felt so weird hearing somehting like that in church.  I know my experience is not unique.  I do attend church regularly, but we never talk of politics.  We talk of mission and helping others, we don't discuss court appointees, you know? Priscilla Owen was standing in front of a somewhat-prosperous congregation, exclaiming her difficulties on getting appointed and ASKED FOR PRAYERS for herself and her family.    I was reminded of this experience upon reading  urlLink this  on Eschaton.  Please protest the appointments of these ultra-conservative, far from compassionate, judges.  Glad I got that off my chest.

      When I was in Americorps and Bush was elected, we knew that he was going to get rid of it.  Then 9/11 happened and he advocated community service.  I was out of Americorps by then, but still glad that Bush wasn't as anti-community service as I assumed.  Yet now I read  urlLink this  on TMW and realize that he really is going to kill Americorps.  It will just be an extremely slow and somewhat subtle death.  If he is re-elected, Americorps and all of its relations will be gutted.  *sigh* I hate that we were right about this.

      This weekend went by so quickly.  Last night I watched part of my new  Say Anything...  DVD with the commentary on.  Then I went on to dream later that night that I met Loren Dean, John Cusack and Lili Taylor.  It was so wierd.  I guess I watched the DVD too close to my bedtime or something, because quotes from the movie were in my dream.  Of course, I have watched the film enough times to memorize lines, so that may have something to with it.  After that dream I dreamt that Tom Hanks and I were like timecops or something - partners travelling through time to stop fraud.  In my "Say Anything. . ." dream, a woman was pulling out of a parking spot and totally scratched and dented the side of the car next to hers.  I was in a building on an upper floor and she looked straight at me as she pulled away, leaving no note anything.  In my dream I wanted to bang on the window at her, but I knew it wouldn't do any good.  What is going on?  How  urlLink Iraq posed an unclear and dubious danger .    Is anyone reading my blog at all? I have to wonder.  I put these links up for people, but also for myself.  Oh well - if you're reading my blog, I hope you're having a good day.  CD of the day: Kim Richey,  Rise .

Not good enough to buy, or even see twice, but not bad.    MoveOn has informed us that they are planning on sponsoring a Democratic candidate pretty soon.  If you are interested in reading more about it, go to  urlLink MoveOn PAC  page.  Who knew I would endorse a PAC on my blog? I tend to think they are evil.  I guess there are exceptions.  I don't know if I will give them any money, since it isn't tax-deductible.    I just found this  urlLink commentary by Jesse Jackson .  I like the "foreign policy is driven by neoconservative zealots" statement.  Tell it like it is, Jesse.  Josh at TPM discusses the WMD  urlLink here .  CD of the day: BBMak,  Sooner or Later .

Why do Americans feel that we can't admit fault? Bush won't admit he's wrong about the WMD, insisting there was a "program" in existence.  A program? He told us explicitly that there were weapons.  And the American military claims there was a "spotter" in the hotel that they fired at.  This is all lies and crap.  Why aren't my Democrats getting more fired up about it?

      Last night L and I went to see Howard Dean.  This rally was unbelievable -- not that I've been to a lot.  The crowd was so energized.  Once Dean actually got to the stage the crowd would have applauded him for saying two words and leaving.  I swan.  My sister didn't even know about Dean before Sunday night, but she got totally into it last night.  It was a very neat experience, and made me more sure that he is the candidate for me.  At the end, he was yelling at the crowd, "You have the power" and it brought to mind the "Simon Zealotes" song in "Jesus Christ Superstar".  I was probably the only one to think of that.  Anyway - there were tons of people at this rally.   However, I watched KVUE-24 last night because I figured L and I might be on the news.  Their story on the Dean rally was more like an ad for Bush.  It started out by saying, "Most people don't know who Howard Dean is" with the reporter asking "people on the street" who Howard Dean is.  The people on the street spot is such a campaign tool, I can't believe his boss let him get away with it.  Anyway, the report showed about five seconds of Dean and 25 seconds of people saying he doesn't have the name recognition.  They didn't show the huge amounts of people there, instead choosing to focus on about 4 single faces in the crowd.  If I had been Joe Blow watching at home and seeing this "small" crowd for this "unknown" candidate, I wouldn't give Dean the time of day.  So there you go - our "liberal" media at work.  I'm so glad we have a local media that speaks for us (HAAA!).  I never watch that channel since Belo took it over, and every time I flip on it for just a second it disgusts me.  ACK! It frightens me that I prefer the Time-Warner run local station to the other "local" stations.  Okay, that rant is over.  I'm so glad it's Tuesday.  CD of the day: Sting  Fields of Gold .  Sting's greatest hits.  My fave is "Why Should I Cry for You?".

Um - no big news, really.  I had a relaxing weekend, and my sister is back from Australia.  Yay! I got new shoes and a pedicure (J's influence).  I ignored the world affairs for the weekend, although I did vote on Saturday.  When I went to vote after lunchtime, only 4 people had been to my precinct before me.  Now, I do live in an area of town where people tend not to vote, but that is ridiculous.  CD of the day: Putamayo's  Cuba . "Cuba. . .ti es mi inspiracion. . ."

      Poem of the day:    urlLink Dear Colette    Erica Jong    Dear Colette, I want to write to you about being a woman for that is what you write to me.  I want to tell you how your face enduring after thirty, forty, fifty. . . hangs above my desk like my own muse.  I want to tell you how your hands reach out from your books & seize my heart.  I want to tell you how your hair electrifies my thoughts like my own halo.  I want to tell you how your eyes penetrate my fear & make it melt.  I want to tell you simply that I love you-- though you are "dead" & I am still "alive."  Suicides & spinsters-- all our kind!  Even decorous Jane Austen never marrying, & Sappho leaping, & Sylvia in the oven, & Anna Wickham, Tsvetaeva, Sara Teasdale, & pale Virginia floating like Ophelia, & Emily alone, alone, alone. . . .  But you endure & marry, go on writing, lose a husband, gain a husband, go on writing, sing & tap dance & you go on writing, have a child & still you go on writing, love a woman, love a man & go on writing. You endure your writing & your life.  Dear Colette, I only want to thank you:  for your eyes ringed with bluest paint like bruises, for your hair gathering sparks like brush fire, for your hands which never willingly let go, for your years, your child, your lovers, all your books. . . .  Dear Colette, you hold me to this life.  Okay, I started reading  Fear of Flying  last night, and I think it impacted my dream.  My dream was so strange that as soon as someone's rude honking at the gate woke me up early this morning, I went to work writing it down in my journal.  Now I'm remembering more about my dream - like my old roommate scoffing me in front of a group of people.  Which she never did in real life, it just feels that way.  Last night I also did an interview for  urlLink MoveOn  with a woman in Maryland (D.C. area).  I'm so glad I got to talk to her because we have so much in common, even though our backgrounds seem very different.  I hope we keep in touch, because she really seems like a grand dame.=)  I hope our interview results help MoveOn with whatever they are doing.  Our answers to the questions were somewhat similar, so I wonder if other people had the same results we did.  I guess we'll see. . .  CD of the day: Aimee Mann,  Bachelor No. 2 .  Good stuff.

      Okay, since I found the  urlLink vers libre  page, I've been poring over the poetry on the site.  They have "On His Blindness" by Milton to Amy Lowell to Theodore Roethke.  Very cool.  They are missing out on a lot of poets, I'm sure.  I noticed no May Sarton, Grace Paley, or Robert Pinske.  Yesterday when driving home from the gym I almost got hit by a monster truck.  There is this spot on Mopac that splits for the 183 exit, and I always get over for that ASAP.  I did that and this truck starts coming over into my lane, right next to me.  I start honking and keep my hand on the horn as they keep moving over.  I honestly think their height kept them from seeing me.  I was driving on the shoulder even and finally I passed them.  I didn't even start thinking about what had happened until I was on 183.  Ack! Monster trucks = bad.  I wonder if the driver was on a cell phone - that would explain a lot too.  Or maybe he is just a bad driver, period.  Whatever, it freaks me out when I think of it now.  I don't know what I could have done differently, but I'm here now anyway.  Tape of the day: My mix of Patty Griffin  Red , They Might Be Giants  Flood  and Collin Raye's  I Think About You .  Selected songs off of all those albums.  I found it after my mom gutted my room at the house.  Memories of college. . .  Here's a new favorite:    urlLink I Knew a Woman    Theodore Roethke    I knew a woman, lovely in her bones,  When small birds sighed, she would sigh back at them;  Ah, when she moved, she moved more ways than one:  The shapes a bright container can contain!  Of her choice virtues only gods should speak,  Or English poets who grew up on Greek  (I'd have them sing in a chorus, cheek to cheek).   How well her wishes went! She stroked my chin,  She taught me Turn, and Counter-turn, and Stand;  She taught me Touch, that undulant white skin;  I nibbled meekly from her proferred hand;  She was the sickle; I, poor I, the rake,  Coming behind her for her pretty sake  (But what prodigious mowing we did make).   Love likes a gander, and adores a goose:  Her full lips pursed, the errant notes to sieze;  She played it quick, she played it light and loose;  My eyes, they dazzled at her flowing knees;  Her several parts could keep a pure repose,  Or one hip quiver with a mobile nose  (She moved in circles, and those circles moved).   Let seed be grass, and grass turn into hay:  I'm martyr to a motion not my own;  What's freedom for? To know eternity.  I swear she cast a shadow white as stone.  But who would count eternity in days?  These old bones live to learn her wanton ways:  (I measure time by how a body sways).

       Sonnet   Elizabeth Bishop    I am in need of music that would flow Over my fretful, feeling fingertips, Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips, With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow. Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low, Of some song sung to rest the tired dead, A song to fall like water on my head, And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!  There is a magic made by melody: A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep To the subaqueous stillness of the sea, And floats forever in a moon-green pool, Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.   One of my favorite poems, period.  From  urlLink vers libre .

      This morning I woke up at 2:48 to blasts of thunder and bolts of brightness through my window.  It was so bad that I was lying in bed thinking - why don't I have renter's insurance?  I dreamed last night that someone called me and I answered the phone from bed.  Then in the shower this morning, I wondered if someone really did call.  I also dreamed that I was walking with L and someone congratulated her.  Immediately I asked her, "Are you pregnant?" and she put her head down guiltily.  What is up with that?!!! She is in Australia right now!  CD of the day (and yesterday too): Fountains of Wayne  Utopia Parkway .

      This weekend went by so quickly.  They all seem to nowadays.  I feel like I didn't accomplish much, but I was pretty much doing stuff all weekend.  I just found out about the disturbing amount of pollution Kodak is producing in New York.  I'm quite sad about it, because I was taught that Kodak makes the best B&W film (TMax).  So now I am in a quandry - should I keep buying Kodak film and contribute to the  urlLink destruction of our environment ? Or do I boycott Kodak and find a comparable brand? I honestly don't know what to do.  I guess it is a good thing in this case that I don't take that many photos.  I'm so saddened by this information . . .   urlLink Where are the WMDs?

      Sunday we went to the new Target and I bought stuff that I don't really need.  This is good to do every once in a while.  I bought the new Liz Phair album (I've already memorized "Rock Me"), two chick-lit books, makeup, and a Milka bar.  I love that the Target is so close!  I signed the paperwork for my new apartment.  I'm so glad to be moving - this weekend I discovered there is/was a mouse in my kitchen.  It broke into my loaf of bread and graham crackers.  Maintenance came in yesterday and I think scared him off.  But now I have a sticky mouse trap on my kitchen floor.  *sigh*  Only a few more weeks. . .  I will probably have to work late again this evening.  And I think M is going to meet me for dinner. . . actually his idea.  Well, going out to dinner was.  I'm kinda surprised, because I am usually the one to ask to get together.  Maybe he is leaving for France soon; I have my mind on August and have been preoccupied.   Why I'm preoccupied with August:  1.  this weekend - I pack and help J move some stuff to Houston.  We will shop for a dress for me to wear for V's wedding.  Then J officially moves to Houston on Monday. =(  2.  Next Wednesday I drive up to Plano to pick K up from the airport.  We bum around in the Dallas area til V's wedding on the 9th.  K flies back Sunday the 10th.  3.  The 16th - I move into my new apartment.  Well, I start moving in.  I haven't done any change of address forms yet.  I should probably get on that ASAP.  Understandably, I have a lot on my mind.  But I'm not frazzled.  Yet!  I could talk about the current events, but I just can't even think about them right now.  It frustrates me more.    Although - I recommend you read what Josh says about Rick Perry's plans to round up the state senators hiding out in New Mexico:  urlLink Now, that's classic .  It is so tempting to move to New Mexico.  It's a gorgeous state with great food, a great Democrat governor, and my best friend.  Hmmm.  It's so tempting.  And here's a  urlLink link  to a great article (front-page) on Dean by the NY Times.  Yay!   Okay, that's enough for now.  CD of the week: Liz Phair,  urlLink Liz Phair .  A few of the songs lean towards the poppy side, but I enjoy most of them.  I don't know what to think about "H. W. C."  Not a song I really want stuck in my head, that's for sure!

      Blah blah blah.  Last night I did go see  Legally Blonde 2  which was not as bad as I was led to believe.  I mean, if it's got Sally Field and Bob Newhart in it, it can't completely suck.  It was cute and funny in some parts, but the writing and the music were SOOOOO cheesy.  I mean, this orchestral music is playing while Elle is crying in the bathroom!!! The pop music was cute, but I'm afraid that the cheesy soundtrack doesn't work in the film's favor.  It is definitely worth renting, especially if you like cute dogs.  And lotsa pink.  I worry that I may have to come in and work on Saturday (again).  Mom is off this week and the woman that is doing her kind of work is EXTREMELY slow.  It is just ridiculous.  It drives me nuts.  I am not working on Saturday, even though I could really use the overtime.  I need my weekend.  If you are interested, you should check out  urlLink Lessig's blog .  I had never heard of this guy before today, but apparently he is big on internet law.  He is off for the week and Gov. Dean is writing a daily blog entry.  I think this is awesome; never in a million years would George "darn good information" Bush do something even comparable.  Making your thoughts and issues public takes guts, and I applaud Dean for trying to get down with the people.  Also - Josh Marshall, the man who doesn't even know I exist (*sigh*), has written a neat  urlLink entry  about the Texas Republican senator who is going up against DeLay's redistricting plans.  Reading his entry made me want to write Bill Ratliff a thank you letter.  And I still might do just that.  CD of the day: Elton John,  urlLink Greatest Hits 1970-2002 , disk 2.

       Why I have never supported Dubya  I've decided it is time to share my experience with the world.   When I was in fifth grade, my class went to the campaign headquarters of Dukakis and Bush.  We went to the Dukakis headquarters first, then were told we would have a surprise at the Bush headquarters.  I wasn't too excited, because I was already a Democrat at that point.  I took the Bush-Quayle sticker they gave me and tore it, making it "Quush-Bayle".  It looked pretty cool (I must admit I stole the idea from another student in my class).    We're lined up for the surprise when the teachers announce what our surprise is: Bush's son (guess who!) was going to meet us!  Most of the kids were quite excited (I went to a Southern Baptist school), but I wasn't too eager.  He came in the door and was shaking hands with the girls while complimenting them and patting the boys on the back.  He gets to me and slaps me on the back, saying, "Hey, bud!" I solemnly replied, "I'm a girl, sir!"  Much flustered, he apologized and walked to the next student in line.  Gendering happens often in society, but given that I was in fifth grade and growing accordingly, it was pretty obvious I was a girl.  I should also note there are MANY other reasons why I would never vote for Bush, but this event is always in the back of my mind.    That's all! and isn't it enough?!

       urlLink Happy Bastille Day!  I like Bastille Day because the public radio station here plays the French National Anthem, which is one of the longest I know of.  But rather pretty.  I don't understand a word of it, not being French, but I do enjoy hearing it.  I saw my newest favorite episode of  The Simpsons  last night.  The writing is so well-done on that show.  In this episode, Bart is in a "non-Christian youth group" called the Pre-Teen Braves, and Milhouse is in the Cavalry Kids.  There is a rivalry between the groups and there is an all-out brawl at the end of the episode.  Seeing Marge crying, the Captain suggests that they join in song, and instead of singing an anthem to war, like America's song, that they sing a nice peaceful hymn, so he breaks out with "Oh, Canada!"  They all join hands, singing and making the form of a maple leaf.  It kills me every time.  I think this was the best episode of this past season.    I worked two hours and fifteen minutes on Saturday and I'm not staying late today.  J and I are probably going to see  Legally Blonde 2  and since she is moving to Houston soon, I'd like to be able to do more with her before she leaves. =(  I finished  I Capture the Castle  last night, and am wary of seeing the upcoming film version of it now.  Overall it was a funny book, but the ending was a bit of a downer.  I'm wondering if they will change the ending for the movie.    CD of the day: AfroCelt Sound System,  Further in Time .  I love the Peter Gabriel collaboration on "When You're Falling".  Little bit of trivia: that song was on the list that Clear Channel sent its stations of recommended songs NOT to play after September 11.  Isn't that ridiculous? I believe "Leaving on a Jet Plane" was on that list also.  Thank heaven for media consolidation, because otherwise we'd actually hear some decent music.

      Okay, my dream last night.  I don't know what could have caused me to dream such a dream, but I dreamt that I was taken hostage by college-age girls.  I can't remember where we were when they descended upon us, but there were about 10 of us and they killed 3 of the people.  They said they thought I was a cop, so they didn't kill me (which makes sense?).  They marched us around towns and I tried telling people we were in a hostage situation and no one believed me.  Finally we get to this classroom/grocery store where the girls show us to their professor and he explains that they are studying different cultures and are into cannibalism right now.  So we were homework for these girls! Anyway, I talked to the professor and encouraged him to study more normal eating habits, like vegetarianism or regular meat-eating.  So they didn't eat us.  And it was like nothing ever happened. . . there were no cops to catch these girls.  Then I woke up.  I don't get it.

       The Philadelphia Story  was awesome, and quite crowded.  I think a lot of the people had never seen the movie before.  I say this because in the scene between Tracy and her father, people were groaning at his remarks (which are a bit sexist, I will admit).  But what a neat experience to see the film in a theatre with other people! I saw that guy there, but he left before I got to him.  Ah well.  I'm thinking about going to see  The Lost Weekend  when it shows, so perhaps he'll be there, submerged in his French/English dictionary (which I noted he was reading again last night).  I'm going to use a separate post for my dream last night. . . it was soooo strange.

      So, my friend K and I might be taking a "mini-break" (as the Brits call it) a few days before V's wedding.  I'm trying to see if we can stay with my grandfather and Es, but they aren't back from South Carolina yet.  This strange voice answered their phone and threw me off - it turns out my step-uncle (Es's son, not too much older than me) is housesitting for them.  What is sad is that I can't remember his name.  I have way too many relatives and step-relatives to remember all their names.  I guess that happens when your grandfather marries three times.  Anyway - I'll have to call them this weekend, I guess.  L and I are trying to win Lyle Lovett tickets from KGSR.  I don't think we are going to be successful, but we're gonna try.  We both agree the only way we will go back to the Backyard is through free tickets.  It just isn't worth $40 to pay and sit in an outside ampitheater in my humid town,  surrounded by smokers, unable to see the stage because someone with a cowboy hat is sitting in front of you.  The last concert I saw there was Lyle a few years ago and we left early because the concert and venue were so awful.  Sorry, Lyle.  I'm about to give up on this.  I remember when I worked at the "unnamed" local radio station that plays music aimed towards 20-50 year-old males, I hated answering the calls into the station.  The DJ I worked with (who is now programming director) would just leave me in charge of the playlist, the telephones, the equipment, everything, while he "worked" in his office.  I remember having to take bathroom breaks whenever we played "Riders on the Storm" or "Stairway to Heaven".  Ah, the life of a high-school intern.  He would always try to get me to stay after my three hours until his shift was over, but I rarely did.    My attempts to win these tickets remind me of that.  I would push the buttons related to the phone lines and say, "number one", "number two", etc.  I think these people really wanted to be on the radio themselves, but they never were when I was on the board.  Sorry, guys.  I'm still planning to see  The Philadelphia Story  tonight.  I'm hoping there won't be too many people there, but am assuming there will be, since Kate died last week. =(  It will be great to see it on the big screen!  I heard on NPR this morning that Congress has struck down the investigation into the use of the Department of Homeland Security facilities to search for those Killer Ds.  I am mighty disappointed about this.  I can't find any story about this online.  Perhaps the DJ made it up.  I can hope, can't I?  CD of the day:  Chicago , soundtrack to the motion picture.  Love it!

      Seeing  A Night at the Opera  on the big screen was terrific.  Even though my dad did some loud talking in the film (no surprise), the guy sitting behind me was scream-laughing in my ear, and my sister kept shushing me when I laughed, it was neat.  I sat a seat away from this lone guy who had brought a French-English dictionary and word puzzles with him to the movie.  He was quiet before the film and mostly during the film, but had the funniest laugh.  He was kinda cute, but I couldn't figure out his age.  I'm wondering if he'll be at  The Philadelphia Story  tomorrow night.    I can't believe I used to stay up so late in college.  Last night it wasn't 10pm before I was ready to leave.  We stayed through the first 35 minutes of  A Day at the Races  and then left.  I didn't even want to stay that long, but I do love the phone call scene between Dr. Hackenbush and Mr. Whitmore.  Oh my god, it's funny.  Hee hee.  On a different note altogether - I discovered an interesting site through truthout.org.  The Washington Post has a site up called  Eyes on the War  that has slide shows from different photographers of the war in Iraq.  The only one I've looked at so far is Patrick Baz, who has pictures from the Hotel Palestine.  The stinky thing about this site is that the advertisement section covers part of the flash screen.  Perhaps it is just my Internet Explorer.   urlLink Check it out here .  CD of the day: Guster,  Keep it Together .

      Just remembered - I'm going with L and my dad to see  A Night at the Opera  tonight.  So I guess I'll work out tomorrow night! I love the Marx Brothers.  I've seen this film so many times I could probably recite it, but I'll refrain from doing it here.

      The House approved the  urlLink GOP map  and it now moves to the Senate.  I guess it isn't as evil as it was, but it is still quite divisive as far as minority communities are concerned.    Last night I talked to K and watched  Eight Men Out .  Quite a good film.  I feel so bad for poor Buck Weaver.  Which I'm sure was the point.  I didn't care much for D.B. Sweeney as Shoeless Joe.  Perhaps it's because I've seen  Field of Dreams  so many times. . .  I can't wait to see Sayles new film when it comes out.  I love his stuff.  He is definitely one of my favorite directors.  I told K she needs to update her blog, but I realize she has other priorities right now, like finding a job.  Tonight I work out and clean my apartment.  Exciting stuff, that.

      Yes! There is hope in the world! All is not so bleak!   I just got this e-mail from  Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting :                                       FAIR-L                     Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting                Media analysis, critiques and activism  ACTIVISM UPDATE:  Savage Fired by MSNBC  July 7, 2003  Michael Savage's MSNBC show, The Savage Nation, was cancelled today because of homophobic remarks made by the host on the July 5 edition of the show, according to an Associated Press (AP) report.  Those comments--labeling a caller "a sodomite" and telling him to "get AIDS and die"-- were the subject of a FAIR action alert earlier today.  MSNBC spokesperson Jeremy Gaines told AP, "His comments were extremely inappropriate and the decision was an easy one."    Over the past five months, FAIR activists have written more than 2,000 individual letters to MSNBC expressing their concerns about Savage's record of bigotry and hate, and criticizing the network for hiring a host who routinely traffics in slurs while firing host Phil Donahue over his anti-war views.  Savage can still be heard on some 300 radio stations across the country.   Thank you, Jesus!

      From Tom Paine's blog, I read this nifty  urlLink entry  making my fears about the economy more vivid:  "If the employment news seems unusually bad these days, that’s because it is. A report from the minority staff of the House Appropriations Committee reveals that no president since (ready for this?) Hoover has had a worse job-creation record. More specifically, no U.S. leader since the Depression has actually lost jobs during his four-year tenure… until now."  Thanks, Bush! I'm just gonna say this every time I hear about the stinking economy.  My friend JJ is selling her house for a fraction of what she originally paid.  The only consolation is that she knows who is buying it and they raise foster kids.  Knowing this makes up for the loss she is taking.  I'm amazed at the outlook she can take in this.  All I can think is, "Thanks, Bush!"  I refrain from calling him the "P" word whenever I can.  Anyway. . .  Americorps is dying.  Please contact your legislators and ask them to add more money to the Americorps budget.  I'm so afraid that Bush will slowly kill Americorps and by the time the citizens realize it, it will be too late.  Such a fatalistic entry.

      Oh - I forgot to comment on what I read in "Parade" yesterday.  Someone wrote into the "Personality Parade" section asking if Dean was a serious candidate.  I believe the answer to that question was that he was too "liberal" to be a serious candidate.    If you were seriously wondering about a candidate, why would you write to someone who writes about celebrities? and who is doing better, Ivana Trump or Marla Maples? Sheesh, people.  Along with this, the idea that Dean is a liberal candidate is ridiculous.  I mean, he is, otherwise I wouldn't be pulling for him, but he is a lot more conservative than Kucinich (who I view as a somewhat viable candidate).  Why else would the NRA like him? and his views on the death penalty are not quite liberal, either.  Thanks for letting me vent.

      After a three-day weekend, I am back.  This weekend was a bit strange because we didn't really do anything specifically Independence Day-related.  Just watched movies, read books, and went shopping!  It was definitely a nice break.   Random notes from my weekend:   1.  While watching  I love 1987  on VH1, I was excited to see my oft-quoted anti-drug PSA shown as the Public Service Announcement of 1987.  Let me set the stage for you - teenage boy on bed listening to headphones.  Dad comes in with a cigarbox full of some drug, let's assume pot.  He confronts boy, "Where did you get this? Who gave this to you?" and such questions.  Boy stonewalls him until it becomes too much and finally yells out, "YOU, alright? I learned it by watching you!!"  The ad concludes with some comment like parents who have drugs shouldn't expect any more from their own kids.  I started quoting the "I learned it by watching you" phrase in high school, inspired by this ad, and screamed "Oh my God!" as soon I saw the first shot of the ad.  After all these years. . .it's still a damn cheesy ad. =)  2.  Had some strange dreams.  Saturday night I dreamed that I had to spend the night at church on a pullout couch.  I woke up in my dream and couldn't figure out where I was.  Then I woke up in real life and was utterly confused.  AIM also figured prominently in my dream.  I remember at one time,  D was sitting across a desk from me and as we chatted I stroked his hand.   Then he went back to AIM world and my dream went on.  The thing is, it wasn't really him, but it was him.  And Friday night I dreamed that Jennifer Garner and I were friends and she was marrying this random Indian guy.  Her wedding dress was white and consisted of white tiers with fruit and pudding cups on them.  Huh?  There's more that I have forgotten now.  And last night I dream that I am back at AC, going to classes.  Except I skip two of my morning classes and just go to choir.  I get to choir and after sitting for a while, comment loudly that I don't understand why I'm there, since I graduated in 2000.  Then I run out.  As I'm doing this, I realize that I'm not wearing pants, but am okay with that.  What?  And why was Neil from my high school at my college? Huh?  3.   Antwone Fisher  is an awesome movie and I strongly recommend it.  At one point in the film I felt a strong desire to join the navy.  It's that good. =) Ha!   If I find any news to comment on, I will. . .   CD of the day: Dolly Parton,  The Grass is Blue .  I listened to "I Still Miss Someone" on repeat.

      This morning I woke up at 6:15 and couldn't get back to sleep.  So I went ahead and took my shower.  I listen to NPR in the shower and the local person said it was 8:20.  I thought she had read the time wrong so I thought nothing of it.  As soon as I finished my shower, however, I ran out to my microwave clock which read 8:35.  So I don't know what happened, but my alarm clock got an hour and 45 minutes off.  Did the power go off? In my sleep did I turn my clock back? I have no idea.  I was so confused, I thought perhaps I had slept for days! Perhaps it was already Friday!  But no, it is Wednesday and I was late for work.  At least I slept well.  I didn't go to the hearing last night because I knew I would be well-represented.  The  urlLink Statesman  covers it today.  There is a map with the article that shows the current and proposed redistricting.  I had to print it out; it is not as far out as the last proposed maps were.  But I still fear that minority votes will not be recognized.  At least Travis County isn't divided as ridiculously as it had been, but still . . .  This is just a ridiculous waste of our money - this special session on redistricting.  Our schools are dying and the taxpayers money is funding this stupid special session.  Argh.  CD of the day: FOW,  Welcome Interstate Managers  on random play in my car.  Since I was in a hurry this morning I didn't really get to appreciate much of it.

      Written 6/24/03:  The clouds made me homesick tonight.  Something about the  formation, tone or color made me reminiscent for a past  time and place and person. Sadness collected in my head  as I drove and sang along to "Halley's Waitress".  I looked out at those clouds driving to my apartment and remembered being a better another  person  looking at those dark blue clouds, contemplating my solitude.

      Last night L and I were watching  The Music Man  and I told her about that show that Al Franken was on a few years ago which was based in a newsroom, "Lateline".  On one of the shows they were covering the demise of Buddy Hackett, except he hadn't really died.  It was so funny - they showed him in a hospital bed calling the reporters schmucks and so on.  Then I find out this morning he really did die yesterday!  How ironic is that? How sad that Buddy Hackett is gone, though.  He was so funny.  I didn't sleep well last night at all.  I did finish Ann Patchett's  The Magician's Apprentice .  I think she is my new favorite author.  Or shall I say, has joined the ranks of my favorite authors.  I have more than a few.  I wanna go back to bed . . .  CD of the day: Aimee Mann,  Bachelor No. 2

      I got my new cell phone yesterday.  The company had given me a Georgetown number instead of an Austin number, but they were quick to fix it for me.  So I have now had four phone numbers in one month.  I'm sure the people on my e-mail contact list are tired of getting my e-mails with my contact information.  Oh well!   The phone itself is so tiny and clear.  It is amazing the clarity difference between my mom's old 1995 cell phone and this one.  It has so much crap on it.  I can actually compose my own ring tone.  That's just insane.  I'm looking forward to this weekend.  My plans:  - finish watching  The Insider .  It's not that bad, actually, even though I don't usually care much for Russell Crowe.  He has been way over-hyped.  This movie came out before the hype really started though.  - unpack some more and trash the empty boxes sitting next to my kitchen.  - read.  - go to a dinner on Saturday night for the mission committee.  - have the youth group over.  No big plans! My kind of weekend.  CD of the day: Kim Richey,  Bitter Sweet .

      I don't think ANY of my principals were ever this cool:   urlLink A message from the principal .  I think that is the funniest thing I have seen all week.  I almost cried, reading it.  Plus, the principal went to my alma mater, so that's an added bonus!  Here's a sample:  "State law has now made the Pledge of Allegiance and the Pledge to the Flag of Texas mandatory on a daily basis. In every school where I've been principal, I've expected the Pledge of Allegiance to be a daily activity along with a clear understanding of what the words meant. I must admit that, until recently, I didn't even know that there existed a Texas pledge and I attended Austin College in Sherman, Texas. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the Texas pledge, here it is.   "Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one and indivisible."   I now wonder if all states have a pledge? What about cities? Being a native New Yorker I do know the Brooklyn pledge:   "Oh Brooklyn, my Brooklyn, no never will I roam Cause where else on the same block Can you eat a knish and a calzone?"   Of course, just to make things interesting, parents can request that their children say only one pledge, or no pledges. This request must be submitted in writing. We are asking that you help us with the needed paperwork. If your child can say both pledges, please attach the word "pledges" to his shirt. If he can only say the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance, please attach the word "pledge." If he can only say the Texas pledge, please attach the word "y'all." If you wish that no pledges be said, attach nothing. If your child is a two-pledge student and you forgot to attach the word "pledges" please call the school between 7:43 and 7:45 so that we may attach the appropriate word to your child's clothes. If you wish that both pledges be said but only on the even days of the month, attach the phrase "two, four, six, eight." I realize that these instructions may have to be sent home more than once until we get the process firmly in place. "  I promise you, there is more to enjoy.  Please go read it.

      Right after work I am going to my old apartment to turn my keys in.  I hope to get some of my deposit back.  M invited me out to lunch tomorrow - his Spanish literacy student invited him and a guest to lunch at his family's restaurant.  I wish I could go (I hate to turn down a free lunch) but I have to stay in the office tomorrow, even during my lunch break.  Man.  Is it Friday yet? This week is going by so slowly.  I keep checking the UPS progress on my phone, and the plan is for me to get it tomorrow.  My dad asked why I bought it online.  I told him that it was because I got to compare plans better.  But now I wish I just had the phone already.  CD of the day: Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer,  Drum Hat Buddha .  My boss let me borrow it.  It's not bad.  I really like "236-6132" and "Gentle Arms of Eden".

      I got an email this morning from Amnesty USA regarding Guatemala's EMP campaign.  I urge everyone to view the  urlLink flash movie  and take whatever action you deem necessary.  And then go rent  urlLink Romero .  I realize it deals with human rights abuses in El Salvador and not Guatemala, but it is a damn good movie.   urlLink Liberation theology ! That's what I'm talking about.  I'm all about that.  Another great film to check out is John Sayles'  urlLink Men with guns (Hombres armadas) .  Yet another film that deals with human rights issues in a Latin-American country.  Both of these films are very well-done, and while ultimately works of fiction, they both deal with very REAL contemporary issues.  I hope you watch them and do something about it.

      I'm in the version of  Dracula  that my church's performing arts group is hoping to put on.  I play Mrs. Fern, the housekeeper, who has the third most lines.  Why does she talk so much? Who knows.  I made her Ms. Fern and we're going to keep her young.  I get to say lines like, "Well, I never!" and "Get Grimm".  What draws me to the housekeeper roles? When my World Lit class in high school read  Hedda Gabler , I wanted to be  urlLink Berte .  I didn't understand the character of Hedda - that's probably why I wanted to play Berte.  I miss that class.  I got to spend 6 weeks studying absurd drama all by myself in that class.  *sigh*  Anyway, we may not get to put on the play because we are in need of one more guy to play Arthur, Lucy's fiance.  I think I'm going to ask M if he wants to be in it.  It would be a nice break from his family and studying for the LSAT!  Next Friday  urlLink Michelle Schumann  will play the  Sonatas and Interludes  at the second annual John Cage birthday celebration.  I am so excited! I spent half a semester researching and analyzing what I could of the work (and the prepared piano), but I've never heard it live.  For more info on Cage, check out  urlLink Cage on the Art and Culture Network  or  urlLink my page on Cage .  *sidenote* My music theory prof told us that when John Cage died, they performed a work entitled "In Memory of John Cage" where they all stood up on stage with instruments for a certain amount of time (longer than 4'33", tho!). hee hee!  Thursday I get my cell phone.  Yay! I gave up and told my phone company to cancel my order for installation.  Who knows when or if it would have ended up being installed anyway? Now I have to see if I can live without the internet at my apartment. . .   I'm going to a memorial service today for a man who volunteered in the dental clinic.  I feel like I should go, even though I never met the man, since I am on the board.  Plus the church isn't far from work.  I feel so awful for his family - he was killed in an auto accident on the way to Abilene? I think.  I know he worked a lot with MDC and will be missed awfully.  There are only a couple of dentists who volunteer their time in the clinic.  The rest get some sort of stipend (although hardly much).  CD of the day: Soundtrack,  Moulin Rouge .  I should probably give this CD away.  I only really like about three songs on it.

      I'm driving K to V's wedding and I'm wearing a really strange dress.  It is empire-waisted, but very short, pale blue with weird side-slits and long sleeves.  I've never seen a dress like it in my life, but I'm wearing it to V's wedding and feeling self-conscious.  In all, V gets married twice in my dream.  There is lots of food set out and I eat some of everything.  The first wedding is a regular wedding, but the second is some kind of communion wedding.  Is there communion at a Catholic wedding? I have no idea.    All I know is, I woke up very glad that I wore what I did to V's real wedding.   I'm sorry my blog has become such a dream journal lately.  But I have to write this down somewhere! =)

      So I have no phone.  Well, besides my mom's cell phone I am borrowing for emergency use.  My cell phone has been shipped, but since it's coming from Maryland, I probably won't get it until Wednesday at the earliest.  Sage is telling me that I should have phone by Tuesday and that they have requested expedited service.  It is so strange not to be able to call my friends in New Mexico, Minnesota, or wherever else my friends are.  I haven't figured out what I'm going to do.    Weird side story - I think L's high school Latin teacher is working down the hall from me.  I already work with my 10th grade social studies teacher's sister-in-law.  Now another teacher down the hall? What's up?  Well, I'll be out-of-pocket blogwise this weekend, but I should be able to check my email.  That's something anyway.  CD of the day: Erasure,  Pop .  Good stuff.  If my math is correct, MoveOn has raised $770,000 so far for the Texas campaign.  Awesome. Of course, math isn't my strong suit, so that number may be wrong.

      I got an e-mail from MoveOn saying how much they raised in one day for the "Defend Democracy" campaign.  It is energizing to know that so many people are behind the campaign:  "In one day MoveOn members have contributed more than $400,000 for our "Defend Democracy" campaign. "  That is so awesome and inspiring.  Of course, I can't afford to donate money to anything right now, but thanks to all who did.

      It is August 2003 and I have bought my first cell phone.  I am tired of waiting for Sage to get their act together and install my phone line.  Now that I've done this, I definitely can't afford to keep my cable.  Ah well.  I'll go back to my $10/month basic basic cable; I watched less TV on it anyway. *sigh*

      MoveOn is running a campaign to put ads on in Texas at  urlLink this site .  Here is the letter from Sen. Rodney Ellis that I was sent in an e-mail plea from MoveOn:  August 18, 2003 Dear friends,  I am writing to you from a hotel room in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where I and 10 of my colleagues in the Texas Senate have been forced to reside for the past 20 days. If we return to our homes, families, friends, and constituents, the Governor of Texas will have us arrested.  I know, it sounds more like a banana republic than the dignified democracy on which we have long prided ourselves. We are effectively exiled from the state due to our unalterable opposition to a Republican effort -- pushed by Tom Delay and Karl Rove, and led by Texas Governor Rick Perry -- that would rewrite the map of Texas Congressional districts in order to elect at least 5 more Republicans to Congress.  You may not have heard much about the current breakdown in Texas politics. The Republican power play in California has obscured the Republican power play in Texas that has forced my colleagues and me to leave the state.   Recognizing that public pressure is the only thing that can break the current stalemate, our friends at MoveOn have offered to support our efforts by sharing this email with you. In it, you will find:  Background information on how the situation in Texas developed;  Analysis of what's at stake for Democrats and the democratic process; and  How you can help by contacting Texas politicians, signing our petition, contributing funds, and forwarding this email!   The Republican redistricting effort shatters the tradition of performing redistricting only once a decade immediately after the Census -- making redistricting a perpetual partisan process. It elevates partisan politics above minority voting rights, in contravention of the federal Voting Rights Act. It intends to decimate the Democratic party in Texas, and lock in a Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. And Republican efforts to force a vote on this issue by changing the rules of legislative procedure threaten to undermine the rule of law in Texas.  We do not take lightly our decision to leave the state. It was the only means left to us under the rules of procedure in Texas to block this injustice. We are fighting for our principles and beliefs, and we can win this fight with your support.  Sincerely,  Rodney Ellis Texas State Senator (Houston)

      This is so awesome, I had to post the whole thing.  From  urlLink the New York Times :   Paul Newman Is Still HUD By PAUL NEWMAN   The Fox News Network is suing Al Franken, the political satirist, for using the phrase "fair and balanced" in the title of his new book. In claiming trademark violation, Fox sets a noble example for standing firm against whatever.  Unreliable sources report that the Fox suit has inspired Paul Newman, the actor, to file a similar suit in federal court against the Department of Housing and Urban Development, commonly called HUD. Mr. Newman claims piracy of personality and copycat infringement.  In the 1963 film "HUD," for which Mr. Newman was nominated for an Academy Award, the ad campaign was based on the slogan, "Paul Newman is HUD." Mr. Newman claims that the Department of Housing and Urban Development, called HUD, is a fair and balanced institution and that some of its decency and respectability has unfairly rubbed off on his movie character, diluting the rotten, self-important, free-trade, corrupt conservative image that Mr. Newman worked so hard to project in the film. His suit claims that this "innocence by association" has hurt his feelings plus residuals.  A coalition of the willing — i.e., the Bratwurst Asphalt Company and the Ypsilanti Hot Dog and Bean Shop — has been pushed forward and is prepared to label its products "fair and balanced," knowing that Fox News will sue and that its newscasters will be so tied up with subpoenas they will only be able to broadcast from the courtroom, where they will be seen tearing their hair and whining, looking anything but fair and balanced, which would certainly be jolly good sport all around.    Paul Newman, an actor, is chief executive of Salad King.

      This morning I woke up completely disoriented.  During my sleep I had kicked off the comforter at the end of my bed and slid over to the other side of my bed.  My head was on a sham pillow.  I don't know how or when I did that.  In my dream I had to deliver a sermon, with K helping me, and basically run a worship service myself.  Matt M. was in my dream, which is strange in and of itself, since I haven't seen nor heard from him since a few days at summer camp (before that we had gone to church together in elementary school).  In my dream he was married and had four small kids, but I was in love with him and wanted him to stay and hear my sermon.  Yeah, it made sense in my dream! In real life I googled him and he is at Stanford Medical School, probably single.  There was a pic of him online, and he doesn't look how he did in my dream (so surprising! she notes sarcastically).  I guess that's what I get for mixing Rotel with my shells and cheese.  Weird dreams.  Okay, I realize I can't blame it on dinner - I've been having them so often lately anyway.  On the Early Show this morning Harry talked to the Alabama Chief Justice who is determined to keep the Commandments at the capitol.  I just wanted to flip him off.  And I did.  Those self-righteous evangelicals make me SOOO mad.  They make all Christians look bad.  More later.

      Hmm. . . what did I do this weekend? Move, pack and unpack.  But I LOVE my new apartment.  I have a bigger kitchen and a beautiful view.  It seems a lot more like a home than my other apartment did. Yay!  I saw  Freaky Friday  on Sunday (packing break) and I laughed through the whole movie.  It is really funny and quite good.  Seeing the end credits I remembered that the guy who directed it also directed  The House of Yes  which is a sight more twisted.  Anyway, I would recommend it.  It is worth the ticket price, even if you are older than a teenager.    Both nights that I've slept at my new apartment I have had some strange dreams.  Sunday night I dreamt about the guys from  Queer Eye  and MG.  I don't remember too much about it.  But last night I dreamt about George Eads ("CSI").  It was strange because I started out playing his girlfriend on the show, but then we were really going out.  Then we got engaged.  Other stuff happened, but that was pretty much the main plot of my dream.  I'll take a dream about George Eads any night.  Whoo hoo! =)  Josh at  TPM  has some good stuff on Tom DeLay. . .  urlLink Apparently he thinks that redistricting is federally mandated by the Constitution :  "Unfortunately, the Democrats in the state legislature don't understand honor because they're violating their oath of office to support the United States Constitution. They don't understand their duty, which the Constitution calls for in redistricting."  What an idiot.  At an open house this weekend, I saw a shirt for the senators.  I kinda want one.  But if I got it, I probably would wear it about as often as I wore my "Clinton/Gore" shirt.  Which is about never.

      From the Statesman,  urlLink   GOP ponders tactic: No map, no primaries :  "The effort will have a backlash on President Bush," said Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio. "I believe it will hurt him in his re-election efforts because we, the minorities, will remember."  The Republicans and Democrats are stuck right now.  Neither will admit defeat.  I've been hearing more often than not how it seems to be a battle between the white Republicans and the minority Democrats.  I don't think I realized that all the Republican Senators were white; what does that say about the Texas Republican party? Another reason I'm proud to be a Democrat.  I just wish the Dems on the national scene would show some gumption the way our Texan Dems have.  I'm moving tomorrow - unfortunately, my phone won't be up until Monday.  Argh.  I am so tired of packing . . . I can't wait to be done.  CD of the day: Liz Phair,  Whip Smart .

       In which I eat bananas with my dead grandfather   I'm sitting at a club with my friend M and we see a sign for an upcoming concert with some neat bands.  I tell him we should buy tickets, but Nolan Ryan buys them for us.  Then I am on the step of my grandma's house with K and KR and we can see my grandpa in the kitchen.  We go on into the house and they make themselves at home.  I look for a plate in the kitchen when K comes in, cursing about something.  I say, "K--! My grandpa!" and she shuts up.  Grandpa is sitting and eating at the table, like he hasn't been dead for over 10 years.  He's eating bananas and something else, chatting with me, and asks something like, do you think of me when you eat bananas? All this time I am thinking I have to leave soon to drop the gals off and pick M up for the concert.  I am only a bit surprised to see Grandpa; it seems natural for him to be there.   Then I wake up and wish I was back asleep.  He was so vivid and real in my dream - but he was never that chatty in real life.  I wonder if I dreamt about him b/c I saw P last week? I don't remember anything else I dreamt about last night.  That was just too strange.  What I watched last night:  The Reluctant Debutante .  I've seen it enough times to just listen to it while I packed up glassware and appliances.  In my car: Sarah McLachlan,  Surfacing .  Current read:  East of Eden  by Steinbeck.  Are all the female characters bad, or is it just me? All the decent people mentioned so far are male.  I'm only a little surprised at this.

      Ha ha!! I just found  urlLink this  at  Common Dreams  and had to link to it.  I knew my definition of "conservatism" was correct: "explained psychologically as a set of neuroses rooted in "fear and aggression, dogmatism and the intolerance of ambiguity". "  And this report puts Hitler, Mussolini, Dubya and Rush Limbaugh all in the same mindset!  I kid you not.  Go check it out.

      Last night I watched  8 Mile , which did not suck.  Marshall Mathers is actually a pretty decent actor, better than some "professional" actors I've seen.  "How can she watch these films while she packs?" you may ask.  Well, I have the movie on while I'm packing, and tend to pay more attention to the film than my packing.  Not tonight, though! I will work out, and then pack.  Yes.  This is my plan.  I haven't heard from the stupid phone company yet. . . arrgh.    This morning I saw Gary Coleman on the CBS  Early Show .  He was talking about his decision to run for California governor.  He assumes that AHNOLD will win.  All I can say to that is, " It's not a tumor!!!! "  But seriously, I'm pulling for Arianna.  Since she came to see the (progressive) light, I find myself agreeing more and more with what she has to say.  I feel somewhat sorry for Gray Davis, but I can't say much more than that b/c I don't know a whole lot about CA's situation right now.  I feel like I'm living in loony-land here in Texas. . . what the hell? I just read  urlLink this .  So the Republicans are going to fine the Democrats $1,000/day (from their personal funds) until they come back to Texas? This is ridiculous.  Maybe I'll become a "yellow-dog" Democrat; I actually voted for Greg Abbott (a Republican), believing that he could do the job.  But now I think that DeLay owns him, too.  The move to New Mexico is becoming more and more tempting. . .  That's what I'll do - I'll become a New Mexican Episcopalian. . .  CD of the day: Fountains of Wayne,  Utopia Parkway .

      Packing tonight . . . it's so much fun.  Actually, I don't mind it so much.  It's the unpacking I mind.  Last night I attempted to pack while watching  Birdman of Alcatraz .  The title of this film is misleading - he didn't actually raise any birds in Alcatraz, only at Levinworth.  It's a decent film, though a tad melodramatic.  I wished I was watching  The Manchurian Candidate  at certain points - that is a much better Frankenheimer film.  I met with someone for coffee (her) and cinnamon rolls (both of us) this morning.  She works for the non-profit I am on the board of and wanted to discuss my goals/dreams for the organization.  Somehow we got to talking about blogs, and she asked me what the appeal was.  "Why do you want to put your personal thoughts out there for everyone to read?" I told her a) they are extremely user-friendly, b) I like recommending links I find and music/films I love, and c) I don't name names.  My friends who read it (a small number) know who they are, and others don't.  I also told her that I do have a "real" journal for stuff I don't want anyone else to read (but it's faster and easier to type it here than write long-hand in my book).  I was trying to convince her that the MDC webpage needs serious updating.  I think I volunteered myself to help.  CD of the day: Liz Phair,  Whip Smart .  Great so far - less polished than her new album, so it sounds more original.

      I've added a new motto on my side menu here; I figure this site is more "fair and balanced" than Faux News on any day! Click on my motto to read more about it.  You may ask, as my sister has, why do I want to become Episcopalian? Well, I was baptized Episcopalian, but that was a while ago. . . the fact that they have made an openly gay man a bishop gives me great hope for other Protestant denominations (I'm not kidding myself about the Southern Baptists, tho).  The Presbys are supposed to discuss accepting homosexuals at the next General Assembly.  I'm afraid it will break up the church.    The problem is - the majority of Presbyterian churchgoers are past the age of 55.  I may be exagerrating slightly, but not much.  The older generations tend to be more set in what they expect from worship and their church.  I can't think that all of them will be open-minded when it comes to accepting gay or lesbian preachers.  I'm not that naive.  I do think there will be a large number of people that are ready to accept that, because they realize the Presbyterian Church will slowly dwindle down to nil if we don't figure out a way to get more people involved.  Since it wasn't that long ago that the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. was divided into Northern and Southern sections, I fear that this issue could split it again.  I'm wondering what people in my own congregation think.  Hmm.  I know some of them would agree with me, but I fear a lot of them wouldn't.  If my denomination doesn't get its act together soon, I may be attending an Episcopalian Church.  We'll see!

      Here's a nice bit of hooey for you:   Elizabeth S -- A very special Taurean    Elizabeth S-- is deeply sensual. Her senses of touch, smell and sight are highly refined. And as for her taste? It's impeccable. Elizabeth is extremely discriminating - when she sees the best, she won't ever settle for anything less. She would rather 'go without' than go for a poor substitute. But then that's Elizabeth all over. It really isn't fair to call her 'stubborn as a mule.' Mules are adaptable, easy going creatures who are always eager to please - or at least, they are by comparison to Elizabeth S--. Unfortunately, for a person with such expensive preferences Elizabeth is not a millionaire ...or at least, not yet. You never know, it may just happen because Elizabeth's relationship with money is very interesting. She treats it with a curious mixture of disdain and respect. She never lets it stand in her way, yet she will go out of her way to get it when she needs to. Elizabeth is a smart cookie and a shrewd operator. It is not though, merely in the field of finance that Elizabeth S-- displays intuitive wisdom.  Elizabeth has an affinity with nature. She can make almost any plant flower and bear fruit. This is just as well because Elizabeth has a hearty appetite. She likes her food as indeed she likes all her creature comforts. Fond though she is of all the above - and of all life's little luxuries - there is one more source of endless fascination that Elizabeth cannot resist. Elizabeth doesn't so much have a hearty appetite for sensual pleasure as a ravenous hunger for it! Which is funny really because you wouldn't necessarily think it to look at her. Elizabeth likes to play it cool. Elizabeth likes to pretend that nothing bothers her, fazes her or excites her. Like all Taureans though, Elizabeth S-- is a powerhouse of passion, as those who are lucky enough to know her - or to love her - will breathlessly testify.   Thanks to  urlLink Jonathan Kainer's Zodiac Forecasts .  I didn't know I was so passionate - you learn something new every day!

      My mini-break was very nice.  It wasn't really much of a break, because I kept busy the whole time, but at least I wasn't working!  Here's the rundown of my days off:  Weds - drove to Plano, picked up K at the airport, ate dinner with P and E, stole glances at MG, met V at Target and we all went to Chili's, learned the story behind our waiter's hickies.  Thursday - went to the Women's Museum (which wasn't as great as I thought it would be).  Since I already took Gender Studies and Women's History in America, it was no new information.  Although - the little music area is cool.  We spent way too long at the museum, ate California Pizza Kitchen and drove back to Plano.  Since it was MG's birthday, we stayed at the house that night and watched  Contact  with him, drinking Kahlua and milk.    Friday - went to the Dallas Museum of Art, which doesn't open until 11am.  How silly.  We checked out the modern art and the exhibit on Renoir in Algeria.  We got a little lost on the way to V's apartment (I was driving and I need specific directions!), then we ate spaghetti and I left K there.  I drove back to Plano, read some Grace Paley short stories, then met KR at a certain numbered theatre .  We ate Italian and gossiped about the love lives of others and the lack of ours, and then we saw Agatha Christie's  The Hollow .  It was a really good show, and didn't cost me anything, since KR works there.  I got a little lost on the way out there, but got back to Plano with no problems.  I was invited to go to V's bachelorette party, but I refuse to go to any form of a strip club, male or not.  So I stayed up til 2am watching campy "Dr. Who" on KERA and waiting for K to get to the house.  Saturday - the wedding, finally! It rained, of course.  K sang "Ave Maria" and the groom's sister amazed us all with a lack of any musical talent.  I was biting my program - that's how bad she was.  Ugh.  The reception was at Southfork, of "Dallas" fame, and was lots of fun.  I tried to nap after that, but didn't really succeed.  We met KR at Bennigan's where I got a strong Mojito and then went back to the house.  E had "Sabado Gigante" on, but it hurt my brain to try and translate it all so I read some more.  Later we borrowed MG's copy of  Drunken Master  and started dozing before it was over.  Sunday - E fixed us enchiladas (REALLY SPICY) for breakfast, we chatted with MG and P, then I dropped K off at the airport and headed on home.  FYI - P is my grandfather, E is his third wife and MG is her son (only 2 years older than me and NOT a blood relation).   It went by so quickly and I wish I could have chatted some more with MG.  He's so very nice to look at.  K agrees and flirted with him.    Anyway, now I'm back at work.  I have to pack every night this week.  I called my phone company to set up at my new apartment, and the guy says, "we may have to give you a new number."  The guy I talked to a few weeks ago told me I would be able to keep my number!   That's all for now.  I'll have more later on why I want to be Episcopalian and other such issues.  CD of the day: Phil Collins,  Hits .

       What weekend?   It sped by so quickly, it barely registered.  That's what I get for driving to Houston and back in one day, then going to a concert.  I got passes to see Liz Phair in a convoluted way: I work with the grandmother of her keyboard player.  Her portion of the concert was quite short, but since I only had to pay $5 for parking, I feel it was totally worth it.  I got to hear "Supernova", so it's all good.  That song is soooo awesome.  J's apartment is in central Houston, as far as I can tell.  My experience with Houston is quite limited.  I've been there three times now.  The first time I got dehydrated b/c of the humidity, the second time I got to stay in the Hilton and read  American Gods  in the Enron food court, and this third time really was too short to count.  This was the first time I actually drove in Houston.  As I was stuck on IH10, I remembered my driver's ed teacher standing by the blackboard, daily regaling us with the terrors of Houston traffic.  It really wasn't all that bad.  And since J is going to be living there now, I'll have to visit.  Plus - they have a great opera program! And I bought an outfit (tax-free weekend!!!) at Anthropologie.  I have a feeling I paid WAY too much.  But it looks good.  I got V's wedding present on Sunday.  Luckily they are registered at places I thought to look.  Otherwise, they were gonna get a gift certificate.  I much prefer giving them things I know they want/need.    I drive up to Plano Wednesday.  I hope I get everything done before then.  I probably won't be able to blog until next week. . .   Current rants :  I can't believe Bush's response last week at the press conference to the question of gay marriages.  We know you're a Christian, bubba! You don't have to make a vague reference to a parable to remind us.  And why do you think that saying we're all sinners is a way to answer that question?    I'm glad that Dean is getting lots of media attention.  He's going to be on Larry King this evening and I'm going to try to call in and ask what he thinks about Americorps and Bush's treatment of it.  I doubt I'll get on, but I'll try.  I hope this early media attention works for him.    That's all for now - I better go get the mail.

      I just found out that Fountains of Wayne will be on VH1 tonight! Apparently it is some concert with Sugar Ray, Vertical Horizon and Fountains of Wayne.  I am quite excited! If you have VH1, it will be on at 7pm Central.  I'll have to record it, since I got my "Gilmore Girls" on at the same time.  This just made my day about 50% better. =)  UPDATE: FOW was NOT on this concert.  Stupid TV Guide.  However, one of the tracks from "Welcome Interstate Managers" was playing in the background of a scene in "Gilmore Girls" last night.  That was neat - although I was surprised they chose that track since it says, "I gotta get my shit together".  I guess they figured that you would pay attention to the discussion held over the music rather than the song itself.

      I'm trying to keep informed as far as this investigation ("Wilsongate"?) goes.  If you are as interested as I am, here are some good links to check out:  -  urlLink Talking Points Memo  - Josh is keeping extremely updated of the goings-on related to Wilson and the leak.  He was onto the story before the big media picked it up.    -  urlLink Demand an Independent Investigation!  - sign this petition for an independent investigation into the leak.  Ashcroft's "Justice" department will not do anything on this.  And if you have no idea what I'm talking about,  urlLink here  is an article about it.

      This week is going to be busy.  The past two have been and this one is no different.  All I can do is look forward to the weekend.  This past weekend I got my hair cut and highlighted and watched "Holes" (about as good as the book, which says a lot) and some old episodes of "Sex and the City".  And I read some, cleaned some, and went to the gym.  I love weekends like that.  I watched  Alias  last night and was confused.  This whole "gone for two years" thing is pretty whack.  I do love watching such intense television though.  The only new show I can really see myself getting hooked on is that  Joan of Arcadia .  The idea is pretty novel and I really liked the first episode.  the other new shows I viewed were:   Two and a Half Men  - the writing is pretty stinky, but it's Jon Cryer! If anyone deserves a hit TV show, he does.  I can't see myself watching it much, but it doesn't suck!  Cold Case  - very neat show.  I really like the strength of the main character.  But why was her partner shooting up at the office? Does he have diabetes? Huh? I might watch this show, except it's on when  The Simpsons  are.  I actually forgot they were on at all last night until 10pm.  Whoops!  The Lyon's Den  - Watching this show after  Alias  was not a good idea.  It just can't compare.  It is a tad melodramatic and I didn't really sympathize with any character - except maybe the paralegal, played by David Krumholz (see  10 things I hate about you ).  I don't think I'll make a point to catch it.  So my TV schedule is basically the same as last year: Monday - nothing. Tuesday - 7pm -  Gilmore Girls , 9pm -  Queer Eye  (it takes  Judging Amy 's spot). Wednesday - nada. Thursday - 7pm  Friends , 7:30  Scrubs , 8pm  CSI , 9pm  Without a Trace . Friday - 7pm  Joan of Arcadia , 8:30  Life with Bonnie , 9pm  Boomtown  (maybe.  After the season premiere I am unsure if it will stack up to last year.  Their format has changed and Vanessa Williams is now on it. We'll see.) Saturday - no way. Sunday - 7pm  Simpsons , and  King of the Hill , whenever that's on. 8pm  Alias .  So how many hours of TV is that? 8 or 9? That's enough.  Throw in  Curb your enthusiasm  and  Monk  when those come back on.  CD of the weekend: Seal,  Seal IV .  I LOVE "Waiting for You".  Overall, a great album.  My impulse buy at Target. =)

       The Handmaid's Tale   My last challenged book of the week is Margaret Atwood's  The Handmaid's Tale .  I'm not as surprised that this book is challenged as I am about the others.  It is such a forward-thinking work, telling the story of a woman in a future time and how she must deal with the power struggles.  In this future, all women have little or no power.  I haven't read it in a few years, but if I remember correctly, for some reason a lot of women can't have children.  So these handmaids are brought in to procreate with the rich men.  I'm probably botching the story, but it is really good, and quite disturbing.  A good feminist novel - and so is her earlier book,  The Edible Woman .

       A Light in the Attic  I will start out by admitting that I am a huge Shel Silverstein fan.  I remember when I was a kid, I performed in the church talent show by reading poems from this book.  I read about four or five, but the only one I specifically remember reading was the one about washing the dishes.    I can't figure out why this book is challenged and his others aren't.  Or rather, I can't understand why this book is challenged.  Period.

       Bridge to Terabithia   Katherine Paterson is an ex-missionary who has written such collections as  Angels and Other Strangers , which I think is the greatest collection of short stories based around Christmas ever.  I also love  Jacob Have I Loved , although it is a pretty depressing book.  It is interesting to read a book written from the point of view of the lesser sister.    But my banned/challenged book of the day is  Bridge to Terabithia , which is probably her best-known work.  I remember when I was in elementary school they showed a movie version of it on  Wonderworks , which used to be shown on PBS.  Does anyone else remember that show?  Anyway, it is basically about a boy who has to deal with a new next-door neighbor.  They become friends and share an imaginary kingdom.  I really should re-read it, since I haven't read it since elementary school! I do remember the haunting ending, though.  *sigh*    For more information on Katherine Paterson and her books, visit  urlLink terabithia.com .  CD of the week: Lauryn Hill,  The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill .  I've got that in my car and Shawn Colvin's  Fat City  in my apartment.  Both REALLY good CDs.

       A Wrinkle in Time   Madeleine L'Engle's great work  A Wrinkle in Time  is my banned/challenged book for the day.  It amazes me that this book is challenged.  Just because there is a fantastical element to it, some kids are missing out on this book.  My mom used to read this to us when my sister and I were very small (we read the whole trilogy).  I couldn't quite grasp the idea of a tesseract.  I reread it in high school and noticed so much more.    This work is about an awkward girl, Meg, who doesn't do well in school (except for math) and her genius brother, Charles Wallace, who doesn't fit in.  Their father disappears and they go on a quest to find him, taking along a gangly jock called Cal.  I don't think there is an age limit on this book and I definitely consider it one of my all-time favorites.    It makes me so sad to think that some children are unable to check this book out at their library.  Well, the whole idea of banning books disappoints me, but the challenging of this one especially disturbs me.  This work deals with values and ideas that are intrinsic to our society: familial love, being an outsider, keeping your individuality, etc.  Madeline L'Engle has written many more books than this, but this is really her best, I think.  Please go to your library and check it out.  Read it or re-read it.  It is definitely worth it.  Other L'Engle books to check out:  Many Waters  - Meg's twin brothers Sandy and Dennys go on a journey of their own.  An Acceptable Time  - Meg's daughter Polly time-travels. Sort-of.  A Live Coal in the Sea  - not part of the Murry saga.  Camilla (from  Camilla ) is older and wiser and reflects back on her life.

       It's Banned Books Week!   I'm back, yay! Last week was hard, but hopefully will aid me financially.  This week is Banned Books Week and to celebrate how ignorant our nation is, I will celebrate one banned/challenged book a day.  Today's book is  In the Night Kitchen  by Maurice Sendak.  It is #21 on the list of the  urlLink 100 most challenged books .  For those of you unfamiliar with this great book, I'll give you a little background.  A little boy dreams of flying around a "night kitchen" in a suit made of dough and almost gets baked into a dish.  My sister and I were pretty much raised on this book and  Goodnight Moon .  I have a feeling it is challenged in libraries because of nudity objections.  Whatever! It is a terrific kid's book.  Both my sister and I have memorized, "I'm in the milk and the milk's in me! God bless milk and God bless me!"  It is worth reading for the illustrations alone.  Sendak's style is just amazing.

       Now hear this. . .   urlLink A special speech to the nation .  Here's my favorite part:  "In addition, every American will get his or her own veteran. Veterans benefits are so pathetic anyway we might as well just eliminate them. Please remember the great sacrifice these men and women made for their country. Do you have a spare room in your home? A veteran would like to live there."  And I would just like to say: funny, funny, and funny.

       Books you should read.   I just emailed my pal J in Houston a list of books to check out, and have decided to pass them on to you, my loyal (?) blogreaders.     GOOD WORKS:     Cold Mountain , Charles Frazier (soon to be a movie with Nicole Kidman and Renee Z) - I resisted it when it came out, but it really does deserve any kudos it gets.      Three Junes , Julia Glass - not about three gals named June, but three months of June in three people's lives.  So well-done, I recommend it to everyone.  The first June is a bit tedious, but the other two make up for it, I promise.    The Blind Assassin , Margaret Atwood.  I'm working on her latest book right now ( Oryx and Crake ), but I remember being blown away by this one.    A LITTLE LIGHTER READING:     Open House , Elizabeth Berg.  I LOVE this book - it is pretty light reading, but so well-written.  I also like  Until the Real Thing Comes Along ,  Range of Motion , and  Pull of the Moon .    Back When We Were Grownups , Anne Tyler.  I don't know if you are an Anne Tyler fan or not, but this is a good one.    Prodigal Summer , Barbara Kingsolver.  Did you read  The Poisonwood Bible ? I didn't like it as much as I have enjoyed her other books.  This one is good, but I also recommend  The Bean Trees  and  Pigs in Heaven .    Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!  and  Standing in the Rainbow , Fannie Flagg.  I really liked  Fried Green Tomatoes , but these really touched me.  Good modern Southern lit.    your bibliophile pal -  Elizabeth  My addition for you blogreaders (all three of you):    After Dachau , Daniel Quinn.  A mind-blowingly good book based in an alternate present.  Definitely makes you think.  I read it two years ago, have read MANY books since, and I still remember it.  It's that good.

       So what are your plans for Saturday?   I have to go vote tonight.  I was going to go work out and then vote, but realized that the polls close at 7pm, so there's no way I could do that.  I have to vote early because I told a work colleague that I would help her on election day.  I get to clerk at an all-male co-op at UT on a game day.  For a consitutional amendment election no less!! I am sorta looking forward to seeing what kind of turnout we'll get.  I can't complain - it is easy money.  $100 to sit, read and talk on my cell phone.  Oh, and get free food.  Maybe I will be surprised and we will have a decent turnout.  Maybe.   I was watching  Alias  last night (big surprise) when someone knocks on my door.  I thought maybe it was someone I knew, but no, it was some random guy selling magazine subscriptions.  I told him I had no money (which is TRUE!) and I don't think he bought it.  He was like, "So how do you go out and drink?" I said, "Honestly, I don't!" He replied, "That's so weird."  Then he regaled me with a tale of how he went to Sixth Street this weekend and got plastered and people bought him drinks and someone tattooed his finger with a smiley face.  I thought, Well, now I really want to buy a magazine so you can go to Europe.  It used to be that I couldn't say no to salespeople.  Telemarketers would call and would be able to keep me on the line until I could eke out an "I don't think so."  Now it just comes so easy.  What was I scared of?  Salespeople call and I just hang up on them.    I've heard it through the grapevine that my old roommate A has been offered a position with a DC law firm.  Before she started law school she told me she wanted to clerk for a Supreme Court justice.  Now that that is an actual option, she chose the firm.  Frankly, I'm not surprised.  The money changed her mind! Or should I say lessened her idealistic dreams. . .  I've thought lately about signing up for evening classes or something.  But I honestly don't know how I'd do it.  I just know that I can't do what I'm doing now (job-wise) for the rest of my life.  There is no point.  CD of the day: Elgar,  Enigma Variations .

      Go check Tom Tomorrow's new toon out: you can do it  urlLink here (Tuesday at noon) or  urlLink here  (you have to watch an ad first).  It is so funny, especially after reading  urlLink Rumsfeld Strikes Back at Critics of U.S. Effort on Terror .  Ha ha ha! Note the sign in the background "D.N.C.: We hate America!"  I didn't catch Bush's speech last night.  I do know that it threw my TV schedule out of whack! But seriously - I heard the last part of the Albuquerque debate last night.  What the hell is up with Joe Lieberman? K had called me after she attended the debates and told me the quotable quotes, but it was still shocking to hear him.  He was okay for VP, but for the real thing? I don't think so.  I'll vote for the Green candidate before I vote for Joe.  Here is who I am open to voting for if they grab the nomination: Kerry or Edwards or even  Moseley-Braun -  but I'd prefer Dean.  Anyone else is just the same ol', same ol'.  I didn't say Kucinich, because there is no way he'll get the nom.  I love Carol Moseley-Braun, but I am realistic enough to know that she doesn't have the name-recognition or the financial wherewithall to make it. =( Wouldn't it be awesome to have a black female President, though? Someday.  I spent the weekend dogsitting for two Scottie dogs.  I didn't get much sleep, and am looking forward to spending the night in my own pad.  And watching more "Alias".  When I first got the box set, I wondered if it was really worth it.  And it really is - the series premiere is great, and really funny if you listen to the commentary.  The second episode commentary is lacking, but a bit interesting nevertheless.  I think what I love the most about watching it on DVD is hearing it in stereo.  Now I have to get the second season.  I think I might ask for that for Christmas, since it won't be out til Dec. 2.  I saw the video for  Stacey's Mom  yesterday and was a little surprised.  I wanted to see more of the band and less of Rachel Hunter.  It is a great video, though.  Good for FOW! They look cute in the video, although they sure aren't in much of it.  I also saw the video for Coldplay's "The Scientist" and was just blown away.  Wow.  I don't care much for the band, but the video is AWESOME.  CD of the day: Liz Phair,  Liz Phair .

      I am not looking forward to tomorrow.  Although tomorrow evening looks to be fun, I will basically be helming the office during the day.  I don't like that much.  But when two people have relatives that die while your boss is already on vacation, what can you do? The best you can.  I will probably not be able to post tomorrow.  But tomorrow night is the Cage concert I've been looking forward to.  M will meet me there and then we watch  Bowling for Columbine .  Yay! I hope he will go see  Whale Rider  with me on Saturday.  I don't know of anyone else who wants to see it (or has even heard of it).  I got my box set of  Alias , first season.  Exciting, but costly.  I'm going to have to wait on the second season. . .  I also got a CD of the Elgar  Enigma Variations .  I'm very glad about that.  Every time I hear it on  urlLink the radio , I think, "Gosh, that's beautiful."  And I call the radio station, only to be told that it is the Enigma Variations.  So I bought it and can listen to it whenever I desire.  Another work to add to my very small Classical Library.  Not that my CD library is small. . . just the amount of classical CDs.  I really should work out today, but I've got a headache (And I want to watch  Alias , let's face it) so my only other outing before going home will be to the grocery store.  And that's all about Elizabeth  urlLink Small . For today, anyway.  CD of the day: Still  The Thorns .  Why don't I own any Matthew Sweet albums? Huh? He rocks!

Don't they have a plan??!! Karl Rove does - he and Tom DeLay are the whole frickin reason we are at the redistrciting impasse.  Yeah, I'm sure Bush will speak against Perry.  As Wayne would say, "and monkeys might fly out my butt."  I think he said that.  ACKK!! Now I don't know what to think about my Dems.  This sure as hell doesn't make me proud.  And the speaking out against other Democrats - that is just too much.

       could I be any more random?   This weekend was very nice.  I finished two books, scanned some old pictures for my  urlLink website , and generally pondered life.  I love unplanned weekends.    I hope no one is trying to email my lycos account, because apparently it is unavailable for a few days.  I love when I get warning about things like that, she noted sarcastically.  I just chatted with the FedEx guy.  That was nice.  It's been kinda slow for me at work this week.  Which is good.  I could be blogging a lot more often.  But I haven't really had much to comment on.  I've been looking at dog rescue sites (like I can afford to have a dog right now!), looking at local rescued dogs.  I had to stop myself this afternoon because I was about to apply to adopt one.  Then I remembered the amount I have in savings.  I get to dogsit this weekend - maybe that will get it out of my system.  My mom's uncle died in a car accident.  Since my grandpa had 10 siblings, I don't remember what this one looked like.  I just remember being at Grandpa's funeral and seeing this man who looked exactly like him.  It was like he wasn't really dead.  But that was his brother.  CD of the day:  The Thorns .  I really like it so far, especially "No Blue Sky" and their cover of the Jayhawks "Blue".

       what I just can't stand   One thing that really irks me is that General Clark is running for President and has not told us what issues he stands for.  Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I like when candidates have the good ol' platform.  Here are some examples from other candidates:   urlLink Dean's page on "Ensuring Civil Rights and Justice for All"    urlLink Gephardt's "Issues and New Ideas"    urlLink Edwards "Real Solutions for America"    EVEN Al Sharpton lists his platform:  urlLink Sharpton's platform .  But go to Wesley Clark's page and this is what you find:  urlLink On the Issues .  All he has are plans - no list of specific issues that he stands behind.    What I can't stand - candidates who won't say what they stand for!

      I added a new link on my side menu.  Laura at  urlLink Mousepads, Shoe Leather and Hope  is now linking to me as a "Dean Related Blog", so I felt I should return the favor.  I just wrote Margaret Cho a fan e-mail.  How cliche is that? I wonder if I'll get a reply.  When I emailed Harry Connick, Jr. years ago, I got a few replies.  We even had a short email discussion, if you will.  This was pre-"Will and Grace".  Last night Rush Limbaugh was in my dream.  I was at some sort of small conference where the Republicans and Dems were in separate rooms and I went to the Republican section for kicks.  I can't remember what I thought was so funny about his speech, but I went over to the Democratic room and was telling someone about it, in between laughs.  Then I realized he was behind me, and I laughed right at his face.    This is after I watched  The Haunting  (the original) last night.  One would think I would be affected by that (and I was - I was spooked out trying to go to sleep last night).  It is a scary film, and so well done.  I didn't realize it was directed by Robert Wise ( West Side Story ,  The Sound of Music ).  There is one scene where Russ Tamblyn's character jumps off some shaky stairs and it really reminded me of  West Side Story  (when they sing the Jets song).  This week has been "harr-ible" and I can't WAIT for the weekend.  I seriously need a break.  Especially b/c I might be going on a business trip to Houston again! Ack!

      My close friend R just e-mailed me and asked me to cosign for a loan.  I have no idea what kind of loan, but I'm assuming educational.  I know she is extremely responsible and will be good for it, but I am still wondering if I should or not.  I really want to help her out, but I am kinda scared that something will happen and I will have to pay her loan.  I honestly can't afford to.  However - I know that otherwise she can't afford to go to school.  It is a pickle.  So that's what I'll be doing this weekend - trying to decide what to do as far as that is concerned.

       urlLink Sarah Bird   I went to hear Sarah Bird speak on Saturday.  The event was called "Lunch with Sarah Bird", but since it was at the library, I didn't think they would actually have food there.  They did!  It was neat to hear her.  She is just as funny as her books are.  She discussed her books, starting with the first book she wrote (a murder mystery no longer in print).  Apparently Avon Books paid her $1500 for it, then asked for their money back!  Then she talked about  urlLink Alamo House , which she just wanted to title "Women Without Men and Men Without Brains".  Sadly she had a NY editor who wanted to give it a "regional" title.  So although her book has NOTHING to do with the Alamo or a house nearby, it is stuck with that unfortunate title.  Trivial facts I learned: - Sarah Bird moved here from New Mexico to go to grad school and follow a man.  Said man joined the Church of Scientology and moved to California, promising to come back and marry her.  Whereupon in California, said man, a Mr. Rogers, met an actress and married her instead.  Who is this actress? Well, let's just say she left this guy (after taking his last name) for Tom Cruise, who then left her for Nicole Kidman.    - My favorite of her books,  urlLink The Boyfriend School , was made into a movie,  urlLink Don't Tell Her It's Me (1990) , starring Steve Guttenberg and Shelley Long. Huh??!!  I believe I was the youngest person in the room.  She definitely has more of a varied audience now, after the publication of  urlLink The Yakota Officer's Club .  If you haven't read any Sarah Bird, I would recommend you start out with that one.  It is her deepest work.  The rest are much lighter.  She warned us that what she's working on now is going to be a whole lot darker.  We'll just have to wait and see!

       morning sidenotes. . .  1) This morning I caught the video for Brad Paisley's "Celebrity" and it made me laugh out loud.  Look out for it -- if you like funny social commentary or cute country singers.   2) On my way to work I noticed a construction sign flashing "John", then "3:16".  I thought, well, do they think that will really convert people? It confused me, because I thought it was going to tell me that John Street was going to be closed soon.  Where is John Street? Then the "3:16" flashed and I thought, Oh, those crazy Christians.  People who think that putting a Bible verse on a flashing construction sign will bring in the heathens amaze me.  All you are doing is confusing the driving public, who will think that some non-existent John Street will be closed soon.  3) I am not used to gawky teenagers scoping me out.  One did this morning by the high school on my trip to work and I just stared right back at him.  That'll teach him. Yeah.  More later about my weekend - I've got to do an entry about the lovely and Hi-larious Sarah Bird.

       I've always depended on the kindness of strangers. . .  Well, not really.  But thank you to the wonderful woman who gave M and I two of her tickets to the symphony.  We got to the symphony early to stand in line for student tickets.  We were hoping that they wouldn't look too closely at M's ID, since he really isn't a student anymore (sidenote: I haven't been one since 2000 and people still think I'm in school!).  We stood in line debating how Tschiakovsky(sp) died.  I said at least it wasn't syphilis, like those crazy Western European Romantics! This woman came up to the three kids in front of us and asked if they already had tickets.  She had four extra tickets since her friends weren't coming.  She said they were free and handed two right to me.  I gasped my thanks and M and I rushed in to our fantastic free seats!  We were on the fourth row, with seats even better than when I won free seats from KMFA.    The concert was really quite good, and I adore the last movement of Tschiakovsky's "Pathetique" symphony.  And am I right that Piano Concerto No.1 In Eb Major by Lizst contains Gargamel's theme from "The Smurfs"?  I don't think I could make that up.  But maybe I did.  Anyway, thank you, kind lady.  People like you restore my faith in humanity. =)

       Mass Exodus  Thanks to  urlLink TPM  for this link:  urlLink Many Troops Dissatisfied, Iraq Poll Finds .  I find this fact most interesting:  "A total of 49 percent of those questioned said it was "very unlikely" or "not likely" that they would remain in the military after they complete their current obligations. In the past, enlistment rates tended to drop after conflicts, but many defense experts and noncommissioned officers have warned of the potential for a historically high exodus, particularly of reservists."  This article basically says that regardless of what this administration would have you believe, the  Stars and Stripes  put together a survey and found some enlightening results.  They realize that this was NOT a scientific survey, but I think the results are still quite relevant.  As the article says, "the survey results suggest that a combination of difficult conditions, complex missions and prolonged tours in Iraq is wearing down a significant portion of the U.S. force and threatening to provoke a sizable exodus from military service."  How will the neo-cons handle this? And don't tell me they will re-instate the draft.  You know, I read a few days ago in a major news source (so it must have been big news) that most of our current soldiers are from rural areas.  Is this supposed to be surprising? I didn't read the article, but I wonder if it pointed out that a majority of people in service are also minorities.  And how many minorities are in Congress again?  There is a great article in the current issue of  urlLink Harper's Magazine  about the GOP's obsession with the military.  If you haven't read it yet, I recommend that you do.  If it were online I would link ot it, but it isn't. =(  It is an in-depth article about the kind of people who make up the military and why the GOP wants America to be more like the military that serves it.

       what doesn't suck . . .  . . .as much as I thought it would: the Angelina Jolie flick  Life or Something Like It .  It was actually not bad at all.  Certainly it had moments of cheesiness, but it was a whole lot better than I expected.  And if I hadn't watched it on HBO last night, I'd never have known.  Guster is going to be here Saturday night and I haven't decided what to do.  I am tempted to go, since I haven't seen them since I first saw them in St. Paul a few years ago.  I'd love to catch them, but it would save me money not to.  What to do, what to do. . .

       What went wrong?  I finished watching "Truth, War and Consequences" this morning.  I was left with a very disappointed feeling.  What a sad state of affairs.  Go to this  urlLink site  to read more about it.  There are interviews and discussions that weren't in the show.  One I am interested in reading is the cameraman's account of a shooting in Iraq.  I was very disturbed by the soldier's reaction to finding out they had shot an innocent bystander (who was 5 feet away from the cameraman).  *sigh*  urlLink Here  is what I'm talking about.  An excerpt from Anger's account: "I never found out what the fistfight was about or why a man died on that hot sidewalk in Baghdad. I can understand the American soldiers being hot, tired and probably scared. But they overreacted. To compound the mistake, they incorrectly claimed that there had been a gunman in the crowd to justify their actions."

      A few weekends ago I was cleaning/unpacking and I found a used role of film.  I took it to be developed last weekend and got it back today.  It mostly had pictures from North Carolina on it.  Like this one:   I don't remember the name of the volunteer I am posing with, that's how long ago this was.  Don't I look authentic, though? We were there for a build in May and it would get so hot during the day (that's why my sleeves are rolled up).  I was in charge of installing the door behind us.   urlLink Here  is a better pic of it.  And  urlLink here  is the back door I was in charge of installing also.  Since I never did roofing (too scary), I got to lead the door (and some window) installation.  This pic was taken on the last day of the build (we all wore our Habitat*Americorps Build shirts).  Our Americorps group got the farthest in the week we were there.  I believe we just started with a capped foundation, and on Friday we ended with siding started on most of the house.  It was pretty awesome.

       (Yes, I am obsessed.)   Another Fountains of Wayne note:   Last night I caught part of  Ellen  and Elton John was on.  I'm not a huge Elton John fan, but I do have his greatest hits.   Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road  is one of the greatest albums period.  Anyway, he is at the piano and Ellen asks him what current groups he is listening to.  He says, "Fountains of Wayne.  They've got an album out now called  Welcome Interstate Managers ."  I am a bit surprised, but very happy.  So if you think that Elton is a good man to trust music-wise (and you haven't followed my advice already!!!), then go buy the damn album!  I am SLOWLY getting over my allergy attack.  I sound a lot better and have been coughing less.  But I'm still coughing.  I recorded  Frontline  last night ("Truth, War and Consequences") and started watching it this morning.  It is quite educational.  Yes.  I LOVE  Frontline .  But why does it have to be on on Thursday at 9pm?  I'm glad it's the weekend, almost.  I am hoping I get over this attack.  Or at least get mostly recovered.

       blah.  I am sick.  It is all allergies, but I just feel awful.    I got to see  Lost in Translation ! It is really good.  I really enjoyed it.  Bill Murray should get some awards for his role - he plays a somewhat more restrained character than usual.  One thing of note - his cell phone in the film has my new ring tone.  Everytime his phone rang, I thought mine was ringing.  It kinda freaked me out, because I knew I turned the ringer off.  I'm only working a half day today.  I feel like the walking dead.  Ugh.

      I just took a survey for Blogger.   I love this weather - it is so crisp and cool when I walk out the door in the morning.  I love that I don't have to have the A/C on at all.  The only bad things are a) it is getting really hard to get out of bed in the morning and b) my allergies are starting to get bad.  But I won't complain.  It is almost worth dealing with to have this weather.  A sign that I am watching too many episodes of "Sex and the City": Characters from the show were in my dream last night.  I don't remember much, except I was sharing a hotel room in a version of Houston that doesn't exist.  Bizarre.  Is it just me, or was "Friends" really bad last night? I couldn't watch it.  But "Scrubs" was great.  I don't know what I think of Elliot's new look.  This weekend I am detemined to see  Lost in Translation , even if I have to go by myself.  I really want to see it that badly.  I'm going to try and write something this weekend, also.  I've become so lax about keeping entries in my journal since I have this blog now.  Bad Elizabeth.  Hey goosie - I'm going to give you a call this weekend.  I miss you!  CD of the day: I'm still on Seal!

      This morning I got gas at my favorite local service station.  There was this weak looking forty-something man in greasy overalls walking with a harsh sort of limp.  As I was getting gas he asked if I could drop him off at the light at the end of the block, where his van had broken down.  I said, "Okay."  Part of me was thinking, this poor, poor guy, and a small part of me was thinking, he could carjack me!  When I was paying for the gas, the owner of the station asked me if I was giving that guy a ride.  I told him I was, and that I thought it would be okay, since I was just taking him down the block.  And that's what I did.  As he got out of the car, he thanked me and said he would pray for me.  Driving the rest of the way to work, all of the scenarios that could have happened popped into mind.  I find it sad that in our current society doing good for your neighbor has such ramifications, especially if you are a single female.  Since it was the middle of the morning and this guy looked so down, I didn't think anything would happen.  And it didn't.

      Just the other day I was wondering what was going on with redistricting here.   urlLink And here is the answer.   I can't believe it might go to the Supreme Court! Of course, we'll probably have to live with it for a few years til it makes its way there.    It is good, old-fashioned gerrymandering, people, and there ain't no other way about it: "The law governing racial gerrymandering is still evolving, but Gerry Hebert, one of the Democratic lawyers and a nationally recognized expert on redistricting law, said there are objective ways to measure whether it has occurred. And looking at the shapes of some of the new districts, he believes it did occur. "

       random thoughts on the environment and grocery-shopping    urlLink thoughts on styrofoam   I just read this on Chris' blog and had to link to it.  It is quite humorous.  If you have ever wondered, what is better for the environment, paper or plastic? The answer is - cloth.  And if you take your cloth grocery bags to Whole Foods you get money back!  Okay, it's like 5 cents.  But that can add up if you shop there a lot! I don't, but you might.  I love grocery shopping in Texas because they have people who bag your groceries for you.  In Minnesota, you have to do it for yourself.  I always felt so hurried because I would try to fit the items in the bag as best as possible.  The checker would always glare at me if I was taking a little too long.  I don't miss that.  I take cloth bags to the grocery store and one time the checker refused to put my groceries in them.  So I had to do it myself, and it reminded me of Minnesota.  I don't mind helping bag my own groceries, but it really is more efficient with someone else.  Am I a grocery-bagging snob? I don't think so.  I took a store evaluation and commented on that girl.  That is the only time I've had anyone take issue with my cloth bags.  Sometimes, the checker will even thank me for bringing my own bags.

       urlLink My new heroine   My favorite quote is: "No matter your vicious rhetoric about Protestants and Catholics and blacks and whites and Hispanics and women, we refuse to be divided. In a time of war, which we are in, when the country is under assault and we have men and women dying in Iraq, it is the height of disrespect and un-Americanism to come to this great floor and talk about the pettiness . . ."  Just a great speech overall.  I'll have to look more into this Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.  Thanks for standing up to those conservatives, Senator!

My first foray into Chekhov.  The DVD has no extras, except three trailers for films that are not it. - went to church and sold tamales. - went to Nordstrom's with J and returned two pairs of (her) shoes. - worked on the VAVS stuff a bit - I have completed the first day of their meeting. - missed out on break-the-chain day by going to Borders.  Oops! I had a coupon (and I didn't know it was break-the-chain day). - did laundry and watched my Sunday shows (except for Alias.  Since that wasn't on, I watched  Coyote Waits  on PBS and recognized spots in Albuquerque.)  Why do my weekends go by so quickly?

      Yesterday Allan at  urlLink The Right Christians  put up an  urlLink entry  with his argument about whether America is becoming more Christian or not.  So of course, the comments made about this entry turn to abortion.  Well, logically! It never ceases to amaze me how strongly people feel about abortion.  You can be wishy-washy about everything else in your life, but I bet you still have a stance on abortion!  I am pro-choice (come on, you already knew that), but I am not adamant about it.  I respect your beliefs, as long as you keep your laws off my body! =) But seriously folks. . . everyone has a right to believe what they want.  Well - escept for the pro-lifers who believe it's wrong to kill a fetus, but okay to kill a doctor.  That just makes no sense to me.

      I watched the film  The Shape of Things  last night.  I got it from Netflix because I love  Nurse Betty  (also directed by Neil Labute) and I adore Paul Rudd.  It is a very disturbing film.  I'm not sure if I liked it or not.  I tried to do some work after it, but I kept thinking about it.  It tries to make a point and I'm not sure it does it in the best way.  If you are trying to say we dwell too much on appearances, why are all the cast members gorgeous? That's what I was thinking afterwards.  I was sitting on my couch, listening to a VAVS planning meeting and thinking, "Why were both of the actresses so pretty, if that's the point he was trying to make?"  So I don't know if I would recommend it, even though Paul Rudd is great in it.  I'm just not sure.  I am reading  Boyhood  by Coetzee (the guy who got the 2003 Nobel Prize for Literature) and I like it a sight better than the fiction of his I tried reading (it was about a professor who sleeps with a student - not my favorite topic).   Boyhood  is written in a fictional style about his childhood in South Africa.  I am learning a good bit about class differences that I didn't know before.  It is a pretty quick read and I would recommend it.  Next on my list is  The Mommy Club ,  The Pleasure of my Company ,  Saving the Corporate Soul , and  The Transit of Venus  - in that order.  CD of the day: Sting,  Fields of Gold .

       Hives?  Last night I dreamt that I was over at Sookie's house with Sookie and Lorelei from  Gilmore Girls , along with my pal K, who was also there for some reason.  Anyway, I am over there baking cookies and visiting.  While I am talking to this young man who has a heart necklace (which I recognize as like my own as a child) linked onto his leather jacket, one side of my mouth goes numb.  It feels so strange, because I can't talk anymore.  After a few minutes, the swelling goes down, and I start itching.  I look in the bathroom mirror and see red welts all over me and realize I have hives.  Of course, I then wake up feeling itchy.  As far as I know, I've never had hives before.  What does it mean that I would dream about having them?  This week is crazy-busy.  I am doing extra work at home, trying to finish the job at least half-way before I go out of town this weekend.  I am going to visit J and we are going to the Galleria.  And she mentioned taking me to a spa, which seems like such a perfect idea now.   **BOOK NOTE**  Yesterday I finished reading  The Known World  and I cannot recommend it enough.  It is far from easy reading, but it is so well-done.  The only complaint I have is that there are a few too many characters; I was almost done with the book and still getting names confused.  Overlooking that, though - it is well worth checking out.  It is basically about the legacy of a black man who ran his own plantation and owned his own slaves.  You learn about his wife, his parents, his slaves, the town sheriff, the man who used to own him, the man who used to own him's progeny, etc.  There was one spot especially that touched me so that I had to put the book down for a bit and think on it.  Go check it out! The reason I did is because it is a  urlLink National Book Award finalist .  And I had read an article about the author in the NY Times (which I was going to link to, but I can't find it).  edited because I found a link to an interview with the author!!  urlLink Jeffrey Brown talks with National Book Award winner Edward Jones about “The Known World.”

       what I saw on the news this morning   First off, I saw the video footage of Bush signing the horrid partial-birth abortion bill.  Read  urlLink this entry  on Tom Paine that points out what I noticed.  I love how these white middle-aged men are standing by their plan for what they think women should be restricted from doing.  And in that vein,  urlLink the building of a local Planned Parenthood clinic  is in danger.  Here's a great quote for you about Planned Parenthood:  It's "a social movement that promotes sexual chaos, especially among our youth."  I wonder what Margaret Sanger would think about that.

       the quick and the dead  I agree with all eight of  urlLink these points , so now I know I am definitely a Progressive Christian.  I feel so modern.  I looked up registered Progressive Presbyterian churches in Texas, and the only one listed is the one I went to in college.  How cool is that! Grand Ave. rocks!  Apparently some self-righteous conservative Southern Baptist bigwig has lashed out at this Center for Progressive Christianity.   urlLink Read more about it here .  The Rev. Dr. Mohler made the comment: "But liberal Christianity is not in need of a wake up call. The dead do not answer alarms."  Therefore, I speak from the dead. As Allen at  urlLink The Right Christians  says: "I will gladly count myself among the dead. For "I" was buried with Christ by baptism into death. It is no longer "I" who lives but Christ who lives in me. "  Amen.

      I got a call from the Blood and Tissue Center saying they are low on my blood type.  That is really saying something, because I am A+, which is a pretty popular type.  I realized after they called (and suckered me into coming in on Saturday) that I haven't donated blood since April! Ack! I used to be so good about doing it.  In college, I gave enough to get a mug.  I don't think I've given enough yet here, but I'm working up to it.  I get to pet-sit this weekend for Rosie, my mom's long-haired chihuahua.  She is so cute, but so spoiled.  Last time I petsat for her, I had to let her sleep on my bed, because I couldn't get any peace otherwise.  She can make some pretty pitiful noises.  But overall, she is pretty easy to care for.  I just have clean up my apartment beforehand.  Blah.  Last night I went to a fund development planning meeting/dinner for mdc.  I spent most of the night standing and taking down the brainstorms on a big pad of paper.  One of the ladies kept pointing at the pad when she thought I was being too idle.  I was thinking, "Then you come up here and do it!!!" It's funny, I can be pretty bossy, but I hate when people boss me around.  Unless I have a really close relationship to them. . . but even then I don't much like it.  At work I have been recording some interviews put to minidisc onto 90 minute tapes.  A local author is working on an AARP project and has been interviewing some fascinating people.  The latest one he dropped by was named Clarence Fountain (who I realized must have been involved with the  urlLink Blind Boys of Alabama ).  His interview, at least the bits and pieces I was able to catch while working, was so amazing.  I am blown away by how much faith certain people have in God and how they put it to work in their lives.  I hope I am able to read the finished product of all these interviews.  The bits and pieces I've heard all deal with segregation, the civil rights era, and growing up in the South.  Back to work.

       Cho and Chopin   Earlier today I thought about joining Blogs4God, but then I read some sample blogs (along with the rules for adding a site) and I realize that I probably criticize the more evangelical Christians too much to share a search engine with them.    This week will be hellacious.  At least my weekend was pretty restful.  I finished Margaret Cho's  I'm the One that I Want  in one night.  It is a pretty basic read, but it made me very thankful for my pretty-much happy childhood.  It is horrible when you think about what hell children put each other through.  At least she is doing alright for herself now! More power to her.  I talked to R last night and told her what I'd been up to in the past year and a half.  My life sounded somewhat pitiful in summation like that.  Overall, I don't think it is, but when you compare what I've been doing to going to law school, or going to med school and getting married, it doesn't seem like I've done anything very big.  Oh well.  I think I have grown in these past years, even though my accomplishments may seem minimal to me at this point.  I keep feeling that what I'm doing just isn't enough.    Enough of that rant.  I'd like to make a sidenote here: I have gotten 2 emails wondering about Bill Murray's ringtone from  Lost in Translation , referenced in this past  urlLink post .  To all who ask - it is from a work by Chopin, and on the T-Mobile site that I downloaded it from it is called "Fantasi Impromptu".  I'm not sure if that is the correct title - I am more familiar with Chopin's sound than with the titles of his works.  When I was in college, I would go to the music library and put on a CD of Chopin's works for piano to study to.  Either that or Bernstein's  Candide , Mozart's  Marriage of Figaro  or Gershwin's Piano-Roll compositions.  Feel free to email me anytime - I hope this helps anybody who is wanting to know.  CD of the day: Seal,  IV .  I've got "Love Divine" on repeat.

      I'm sorry I've been slack about posting.  I cannot believe how busy I have been.  Work has been just too crazy lately.  For the past two days, I've been doing the jobs of two people (or so it seems).  I don't know how late I'm going to be able to stay up tonight.  I'll probably start napping at 11.  And I can't forget to mention my Christmas present from the county - I've been approved for jury duty! Part of me is excited to do my civic duty; most of me is not.  Okay - why I don't want to do jury duty:   1) I  HATE  parking downtown. 2) I'm afraid I'll get stuck with a really boring case/judge/attorney.  When I was filling out my information online, I tried to sound more left-wing than I really am, but there's only so much I can do.  I mentioned Amnesty International.  Ah well.  Maybe my situation will turn out to be like 12 angry men.  I'll be the one who convinces everybody not to give the death penalty or something.  What a happy note to end on.  Happy New Year! I'll see you next year.

       Favorite Christmas Hymns:  1.  Angels we have heard on high  - I like the "Gloria" part. 2.  In the bleak midwinter   3.  Lo, how a rose e'er blooming  4.  Lullay, Lullay  5.  Still, still, still  6.  Hark, the herald angels sing  - especially the Charlie Brown version. 7.   Ding dong! Merrily on high  - more a British carol than American.  I think of the "Vicar of Dibley" every time I hear it. 8.  The first Noel  9.  Good Christian Men/Friends, rejoice!  10.  Silent Night

The Shepherd's Farewell , by Berlioz. I like the Cambridge Singers performance of it.  I think this song ties with Rutter's  What Sweeter Music .  Both are just lovely. 4.  The Christmas Song , sung by Nat King Cole  5.  Blue Christmas , covered by Sheryl Crow 6.  Oh, Santa , Veggietales. 7.  Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas , sung by Judy Garland 8.  He Shall Feed His Flock/Come Unto Him , from Handel's  Messiah .  That ties with  For unto us a child is born . 9.  Dave Matthews'  Christmas Song .  I usually don't care for him, but this is a great song.  That ties with Natalie Merchant's version of  Children, go Where I Send Thee . 10.  John Lennon's  Happy Christmas/War is Over .  I like Melissa Etheridge's version a lot.  Favorite Christmas carols tomorrow.  Best Christmas movies on Wednesday.

       toll those roads   Yesterday I had to actually record a commission meeting for TXDoT.  It felt great being in a room surrounded by a bunch of Texan Republicans, I tell you what.  They are determined to set up a toll road system here.  One of the commissioners, who is gung-ho about it, kept mentioning the governor.  It was an interesting meeting and it could have been worse! I was only bored about 1/3 of the time.  The rest of the time was quite informative.  Most of the commissioners seemed to have good sense and I appreciated that.  But that one commissioner - ugh.  I hated recording that meeting.  Luckily I got the rest of the day off when I finished.  I was brain-dead by that point anyway - no use to anyone.

      I've pretty much decided that, come the new year, I am going to go church-hopping.    I will get to see how different faiths celebrate God, and perhaps find a church home that I feel comfortable with.  Right now, I am uncomfortable at my church for various reasons.  One of them being that I dislike the service going over an hour.  I believe in the efficiency of time.  If we are going to have communion every Sunday (which we are, pretty much), then the time for the rest of the service should be planned accordingly.    I went to a Lutheran church in Minnesota and they handled it very well.  The sermons were well-put and to-the-point.  They didn't speak down to the congregation, but affirmed the open quality of the church.  There was communion every Sunday and the services just flowed.  There was lovely music and community.  I really miss that church. =(  Anyway, I hate to leave my church, because most of the congregation is like family to me, I am supposed to be representing my church on the board of MDC, and my parents won't be able to take me out for lunch after church.  But it just isn't working.  Worship is not supposed to be so frustrating.  I won't move my membership - at least not for a while.    This is such a hard decision to come to, but I really have to.  I'm going to visit Episcopalian, Lutheran and maybe Methodist churches.  Perhaps I'll get up the nerve to visit a synagogue.  I am slightly nervous about this decision, because I am moving from the familiar.  I am moving from a situation where I am known by most of the congregation to visiting where no one knows me.  We'll see how it goes.

       In my humble opinion. . .  The fact that we captured Saddam doesn't really change anything.  We are still going to be stuck over there for-freaking-ever.  My cousin (who was supposed to be getting out of the army this year) and others in his group are made to stay in the force for a longer period of time so they can be sent to Iraq.    So we have Saddam? This doesn't change the fact that we went to Iraq under false pretenses.  We were told that he had weapons of mass destruction (which we have yet to find).  There is no link between Iraq and al-Queda, no matter what this administration or the corporate media wants us to believe.  I think we know the reason we went over there and it starts with a big  O .  This won't decrease our chances of being attacked by more terrorists, in Iraq or out.  It won't affect the candidates for the presidency, or their campaigns.  urlLink Here are some suggestions for the Dems .  Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we caught him.  He was a bad man.  But this capture doesn't get us out of the mess we are mired in.  And we are terribly, incredibly mired.

       Hello, is it me you're looking for?  Random thoughts:  1) How can it already be Tuesday? 2) Thanks to L, the best sister ever, for putting three of my four chairs together.  I now have a table, and if you're in the neighborhood, you might be able to come over to dinner now. 3) My car is losing its tamale smell from Friday.  That's what I get for delivering 60 dozen tamales.  I have a dozen chicken for myself, but I don't know when I'll be able to eat them.  Well, they freeze for a while. 4) This was my weekend: wake up on Saturday, go to rehearsal at the church. Go workout at gym, shower, go to library, go to friends' house for dinner and watch  Holiday Affair  and  A Muppet Christmas Carol , read and go to sleep.  Wake up, go to church, rehearse, eat quick lunch, go back to church, sing at concert, go to reception, do laundry, read and go to sleep.  Does that count as a weekend? I need more me-time in there for it to count. 5) I have two-thirds of my Christmas cards done.  I wrote them last night on my new table with the end of  Metropolis  on in the background.  I couldn't think of what to write in them without sounding braggy or stupid, so most of them just say, "Merry Christmas and best of luck for the new year.  love, Elizabeth =)".

      Thanks to Allen for this link:  urlLink Bush's Religious Language   I want to know why God should look on us more favorably than other nations, considering the damage the USA is doing to God's creation (among other things!).  I wonder if Bush has thought of that.  If Bush really thought that we deserved God's favor, shouldn't he do his best to work for it?    Stam makes the point that: "Given that state of sublime innocence in his own country, like Adam and Eve in paradise, Bush can muster only one explanation for the terrorists' hatred of his nation: "There are people who hate freedom." In other words, they are so evil that they abhor the good because it is good. (But if the terrorists hate freedom, why have they not attacked Canada, which in some respects is more democratic than the United States? Why is there not the same hatred for Switzerland, Holland or Costa Rica?)"   This article makes so many good points.  Go read it already.

I think Gore just realized that Dean has the financial support and the grassroots support that no other candidate can really depend on.  And that Lieberman is too conservative to get the liberal vote.  Here's a  urlLink link  to Dean's blog if you want to read more about it.

I was only looking for them since I read an article a few weeks ago about Maurice Sendak and there was a picture of the three of them.

      Yesterday evening I went to the store right after work to pick up bread for a pot-luck dinner.  This old (obviously Republican) guy in front of me in line started talking to the clerk about how he had to buy out-of-town newspapers, because he didn't trust the "communist" local paper.  I actually started giggling behind him in line.  How could I not? While he thinks the local paper is too-left swinging, I think it is a tad too conservative.  I guess they must be doing something right.  Anyway, I wanted to tell this guy that the reason he likes the out-of-town papers is because they are owned by different corporations than the local one.  The idea of the local paper being run by communists made me want to laugh out loud.  I think the clerk checking him out did a good job of keeping a good face.  The people behind me weren't even paying attention, which was slightly disappointing.

       Metropolis  I caught  Metropolis  on TCM this morning while getting ready for work.  What an amazing film.  The special effects are awesome, considering what the director had to work with at the time.  The music is great, too.  I'm not sure what I thought of all the stereotypes in it though: the ignorant workers eager to rally behind anyone, the idle rich who are obsessed with sex, the pious woman, the handsome hero, etc.  Now that I think about it, pretty much all the characters are more archetypal than stereotypical.  It's on my Netflix queue, so I have to wait to judge the entire film.

      Thanks to  urlLink Jane  for the notice about the sale at the Chronicle Books website (it ends today).  I got the second trilogy by Nick Bantock, which I could never afford at regular price.  I'm so excited.  I already have the  Griffin and Sabine  trilogy.  I remember the first one I read - in Honors Chemistry, my close friend in high school Genny let me borrow it.  I loved the voyeouristic feeling I got from reading the beautiful postcards and notes.  It was such a thrill to open a letter in a book - kinda like a pop-up book for adults.  And the art is just gorgeous in the whole series!  My sister gave me a set of  G and S  postcards a few years back and I haven't used any of them because they are so pretty.

      I watched  Tully  last night, a simple and beautiful film.  I bawled through the last few minutes and most of the credits - probably because the actor who played the dad looked so much like my dead grandfather.  Overall, it is a sweet film with great acting (although there are no big actors in it - they are all semi-recognizable).  It is hard to believe it is directed by a woman, because she deals so well with the relationship between the main family in the film (all males).  I would definitely recommend it.  Plus - on the DVD there is an extra short film called  The Third Date  which is really cute.  It bears no resemblance to  Tully  - except they were both directed by women.  If you are a diehard fan of  24  you should see it, because it has both Sarah Clarke and Xander Berkeley in it.  Overall - worth checking out.

       I didn't buy nothing   I don't know why, but I always forget about Buy Nothing Day! I remember a few days before, but then I forget.  So I went shopping this Friday.  Honestly, I really needed to.  I had pre-ordered  X2  and then cancelled it since it wasn't even sent out by Tuesday evening.  I went to Best Buy on Friday (quel nightmare) and bought it.  It's so awesome!  I also saw  Elf  on Friday.  And you should go see it if you haven't already.  I think I laughed about every five minutes, at least.  It is very quotable and I was able to see the kid from  The Christmas Story .  He plays an elf and I almost missed him.  "You'll shoot your eye out!"  I was asked to be vice-president of the board of MDC.  When considering the position, one of the first things I thought of was, now I have something to put in the alumni magazine!  I don't want to think too much about what that says about me.  I do know that I'm not gonna have any wedding or babies anytime soon, so I should enjoy the items I can brag about.  I am going to take the position.  I wonder what the rest of the board will think, b/c you really can only go up from VP.  I talked to the incoming president about her goals for MDC, and I'm trying to come up with all of mine.  My main goal is to fix the web page.  The current page is outdated, has lots of dead links and doesn't really represent what MDC is all about.    I talked to S last night (for two hours) and he gave me some good recommendations to work with.

       I take on the Oscar noms   First of all, I am  very happy  with the nominations this year.  They almost make me have faith in the Academy's system.   Happy surprises:  4. Patricia Clarkson nominated for  Pieces of April .  I was sure that since this was such a small film, she wouldn't be recognized.  I loved this film and her performance, so this made me happy.  3. Four Oscar nominations for  Finding Nemo .  I knew it would be nominated for Best Animated Film, but was very glad that it was also nominated for Best Music, Original Screenplay, and Sound Editing.  Yay!  2. Keisha Castle-Hughes nominated for  Whale Rider .  This amazed me.  Her performance was great, but I figured since the movie came out so long ago, she didn't have a chance (even for supporting actress)! It's probably a long-shot for her to win, but it would be great if she did.  1.  THE BIGGEST SHOCKER - The academy nominated "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" from  A Mighty Wind  for Best Song.  I prefer "When You're Next to Me", but I'm so excited that they recognized this film in any way.  I hope Mitch and Mickey get to perform it on Oscar night.  That alone is worth watching for.  Seriously.   urlLink Full list of Oscar nominees

        urlLink Capturing the Friedmans    I had jury selection yesterday.  Long story short - I didn't get picked to be on the jury for a real estate law case.  I got to my apartment about 4pm and had time to start watching the DVD of  Capturing the Friedmans  I had just gotten from Netflix in the mail.  This film is so engrossing.  There are so many different viewpoints discussed, and it is up to you to decide what you think.  The filmmakers don't judge for you.  It deserves all the laud it has gotten; it's just that good.  It's up for an Oscar, and I hope it wins.  I'm going to finish watching it (again) tonight, but this time with the director's commentary on.  It just fascinates me that when they started work on this film it was going to be about New York City clowns, but it turned into something much more vital.  It is about Arnie and Jesse and the allegations made against them, but it is also about the family and how this basically brought them to a breaking point.  Rent the DVD or buy it and see what you think.

       stop picking on Dean   I am simply tired of the press and their treatment of the candidates.  It is just ridiculous.  I didn't get to see the  urlLink Deans interviewed by Diane Sawyer  because I was watching  urlLink Frontline .  I'm reading through the transcript of the interview and I just can't believe it.  After the Dixie Chicks fiasco of an interview, my respect for Diane was low, but now it is pretty much nonexistent.  She spent a good part of the interview discussing his temper.  Give me a break.  True, since the hideous scream incident, I've lost a little respect for him.  Just the teensiest bit.  But he's still my first choice, and I think the media just need to get over it.  Anyone who has seen him speak knows how dynamic he is.  He shouts into the mike because he is so angry at what has been done to this country.  I am glad he gets emotional, because that is how I feel.  I am so disturbed by what Bush has done to us, and I want a candidate that represents that.  edit: Okay,  urlLink this  is funny.  I am glad Dean can laugh at himself.  We all know Bush can't.  edit edit:  urlLink The Phony Dean 'Meltdown'  .  More on the scream heard round the media world.

Here is the comment I want to point out (taken straight from  urlLink the White House site ):  "If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people. . ."  Can we talk, here? As soon as I heard this, I thought, 'They already did! Because of the arbitrary will of judges, we have you in office.'  My mom and I kept calling each other during the speech to laugh and complain about it.  With this statement, she thought he was saying that we should just abolish the judicial branch of government.  I just can't believe that statement.

       you are in Io-way  After the caucus results I had to look up how the system works.  Here's an article with a somewhat silly approach, but it works.   urlLink Like jury duty? You'll love caucuses   I was surprised by the results in Iowa, especially the placing of Edwards (and the upcoming campaign-ending for Gephardt).  I think people make the caucuses a bigger deal than they really are.  But good for Iowa to get all that publicity every 4 years.  I think New Hampshire will show us the real thing.  And if that's Kerry, so be it.  As long as it ain't Lieberman!!! I am hoping for Dean, obviously, as I link to his site from mine.  I think he's got a good chance, as long as the press gets off his back.  I studied the media and its treatment of politics in college, and that was before Fox News.  Or at least before it got so popular.  The way the press treats candidates fascinates me and disgusts me sometimes.  They pick an early candidate and turn against him (except Bush - he can do no wrong).    The thing about living in Texas is that I seriously doubt I'll get to see any political ads.  I love analyzing those.

I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it time-wise, since I have to take into account how many vacation hours I have (two weeks worth) and that I have to plan for jury duty (unknown period of time) and a short trip to New Mexico sometime this summer.  But I would LOVE to be at SxSW.  I've wanted to go for a while, but it's freakin' expensive.  So if I volunteer, I get a free shirt and passes to events depending on how many hours I volunteer.

       All women are the same  Or so they say in  Cosi fan tutte .  I went with M yesterday afternoon to see the opera and we were both surprised to see our mutual high school friend Kirk in it.  Kirk went with me to my prom, and then went to college in Vermont.  He is a great actor and playwright, so I assumed he would move on to New York from there.  But I guess he is back here in Austin!  Both M and I wished we had binoculars for the opera.  It was very funny, with a few too many arias and not enough Despina.  The man behind our seats started snoring at one point in the first act.  Both M and I had to smile at that.  I was going to nudge his knee if he kept on doing it, but his seatmate must have done so, because he stopped.  Afterwards, M and I went to Kerbey Lane to discuss Kirk, politics, New Orleans and time.  A great Sunday evening.

I'm also giving blood, going to the opera ( Cosi fan tutte ) with M, church-hopping, and probably reading.  I made bread last weekend and it turned out really well.

       Thanks, NPR!  I actually paid attention to a presidential debate today.  We had a cleaning day at the office and I listened to the debate while cleaning/organizing the copy room.  Both Kucinich and Leiberman made excellent points today when discussing the impact their faith has on their politics.  I completely agreed with them.  If you are a religious person of any kind, your religion impacts your politics.  Even Gephardt said he believes in the "gospel of helping the poor".  Leiberman made the point that we cannot let Republicans think they OWN religion.  I am disappointed in Dean when it comes to this point.  He said, my religion doesn't affect my politics.  Mine does, and I'm not ashamed to say it.  Democrats need to face the fact that the majority of Americans believe that their religion is important to who they are.  We need to learn to deal with this in some way or fashion.  Religion does not equal bad.  Closed-minded people are bad, but religion is not.

        urlLink Some in G.O.P. Cool to Gay Marriage Ban  My favorite quote from the article:  "Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, a main Senate advocate of the amendment, expressed a similar view.   "We cannot simply sit idly by, in my opinion, and let activist judges radically redefine the institution of marriage when it stands in stark relief and defiance of the will of the American people," he said." (I added emphasis.)  They are taking their time to get more votes, apparently.  I can't decide if this is a good or bad thing in the long run.  I can say, I don't think it's going to help Bush, as nothing will be decided by November.  As for this quote, I don't think this amendment will represent the will of the American people.  I can't believe Cornyn beat  urlLink Ron Kirk !!! Waaa.  I went to an Ash Wednesday service with my church-hopping friends last night and we discussed this issue.  M and B tend to vote Republican, but apparently this amendment endorsement by Bush is the last straw.  As B pointed out, though, Kerry isn't against the amendment either.

"Lawmakers said they were particularly appalled by reports that women serving in roles from military police to helicopter pilots had been assaulted by male colleagues in remote combat zones like Iraq and Afghanistan, where immediate medical treatment and a sense of justice seemed to be lacking."  This news is very troubling.  It looks like I have my Senator Hutchison to thank for helping bring this story to light.  I guess she is doing some good in DC.

       more thoughts on the gay marriage ban amendment Thanks to Josh at  urlLink Talking Points Memo  for providing a link to this commentary by Patti Davis:  urlLink Wedded Bliss .  She states, "The irony of our times is that the one group of people—gays— who passionately want to get married are slamming into a wall built of political concerns, legislative wrangling, right-wing religiosity (an oxymoron if I ever heard one), and oddly enraged TV pundits who seem to think the world will come to an end if two people of the same sex join in holy matrimony. . .  "Whenever I hear about the furor over gay marriage, and whenever I step back and look at how tentative and wary we are about love (I’m including myself in that one) I wonder the same thing: What is it about love that frightens us so much? . . . "The harder question is: What is frightening about a same-sex couple standing forth in front of the world and making their commitment to one another public? Is the happiness of others really so threatening? Maybe the bravery is what’s threatening. I don’t know if I could stand up to society’s wrath in the name of love. I hope I could, but as a straight woman, I’ll never be tested on that one."  A very well-written commentary worth reading.  And Josh himself writes an  urlLink entry  that makes some excellent points:   "The truth is that this is all for the president. Most politicians see this as a highly-charged, divisive issue best left to states and localities to hash out amongst themselves until some sort of rough consensus emerges either nationally or from region to region. . .  ". . . I think it's possible that more than a few voters who are uneasy about gay marriage or downright opposed to it won't appreciate the president's willingness to trash the country and the constitution just because his domestic and international policies are in a shambles."  I heard on  urlLink NPR  this morning clips from interviews with different members of Congress, all expressing hesitancy to do anything quickly in regards to this amendment proposal.  Even former Senate Majority leader Trent Lott said this would have to go slow.  I think this just backs up what Josh Marshall is saying.  There is no way this proposed amendment can be dealt with at the speed Bush would prefer.  Lott was talking about it being summertime before they could really do anything with it.   urlLink MoJo blog  has an entry on the faulty comparisons being made between Mayor Newsom and Judge Roy Moore (I'd link specifically to it, but they aren't set up for it yet):  "As for Kurtz' assertion that judges have "refused to swiftly shut down" Newsom, let's consider the timeline of Moore's legal odyssey:   • August 1, 2001 -- Moore unveils his monument, which he had surreptitiously installed without informing his fellow justices.  • October 30, 2001 -- Two civil rights groups -- the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State -- file suit in federal court seeking the rock's removal.  • October 15, 2002 -- The trial begins.  • December 20, 2002 -- U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson issues a permanent injunction, demanding the removal of the monument by January 3, 2003.  • August 5, 2003 -- Following an appeal, Thompson issues a bench order requiring the monument be removed within 15 days.  • August 18, 2003 -- Moore declares he will defy Thompson's order.  • August 25, 2003 -- Moore is suspended.  • September 29, 2003 -- Moore files appeal with Supreme Court.  • November 3, 2003 -- Supreme Court declines to hear Moore's appeal.  • November 13, 2003 -- Moore is removed from office.  • February 1, 2004 -- Moore appeals his removal.   "Math was never my strong suit, but August 2001 to August 2003 is 24 months, right? Two years? So, if conservatives really believe that Newsom is no different than Moore, they must be prepared to give the state and federal courts until 2006 to settle the same-sex-marriage issue. Right? Right?"   edit:  urlLink WorkingForChange-Fiore Presents: Attack of the Gay Agenda  - animation regarding the "gay agenda".

       Never mind, I won't be watching it at all   Apparently all the critics agree on one thing; Gibson's movie  The Passion  is overly violent.  I can barely handle the flogging in  Jesus Christ Superstar , so I don't think I'm going to be able to watch this film.  Here's a link to one review:  urlLink RollingStone.com: Movies: Reviews: The Passion of Christ   The reviewer has this to say: "So graphic are the torture scenes -- flayings, a crown of thorns, whips with barbed metal tips, nails driven into hands and feet -- that the film seems like the greatest story ever told by the Marquis de Sade. "  He also says there is a scene where a tear from God falls from heaven in a melodramatic style.  If there is one thing I can't stand in a movie besides violence, it is sentimental mush.  And I'm sorry, but that sounds completely hokey to me!  What with all the controversy and bitterness surrounding this film, it was doubtful I would catch it.  But now that I've read such reviews, I have no desire whatsoever to watch it.  I'll still comment on it though. . .  edit: because I overuse the same words and I can't spell movie.

      I wanted to link to this, but they don't have a way to link to a specific entry.  Here's a part of the funny, but not so funny, entry on Rod Paige:  "On Monday, Education Secretary Ron Paige declared that the National Education Association, the country's largest teachers' union,  urlLink is a "terrorist organization"  because it opposes the No Child Left Behind Act.   "The White House quickly swept up after Paige, saying the secretary misspoke and was deeply sorry for doing so. But it seems that Ron's little slip provides a certain insight into how strategic this administration has become in using the T word and the dread it inspires in most Americans. What's next? Hollywood figures slammed for being terrorist sympathisers (oh, wait...  urlLink that's happened ). Civil libertarians and rights advocates investigated as threats to national security (hmmm... that's happened, too). It's so comforting to know that we've put the un-American practices of McCarthyism in our past."

       This really comes as no surprise  urlLink Bush to Back Gay Marriage Ban Amendment  I am disappointed in him.  Well, not that I ever had much respect for or faith in him in the first place.  I don't think this is a good idea.  I hope the  urlLink San Francisco  suit does something to stop the politicians in DC from making this a human rights issue.  It will become that if indeed the national government does ban gay marriage.

       The Passion, and all the meaning it carries Yesterday I went to a workshop sponsored by local Christian and Jewish congregations that focused on  The Passion .  In the end, the focus was less on the film and more on the story of the Passion and all it means to Jews and Christians.  Presentations were made by two preachers and two rabbis and then we broke up into smaller groups.  There was an extremely large turnout, so the smaller groups were a bit too big to have a discussion in depth.  Points of interest about the presentations:  One rabbi said that he refuses to help Christian churches lead a seder dinner because the ones he would help with would always make Christological references to the symbols of the dinner.  This surprised me - I have done many seder dinners in my local church, at college and at the Lutheran church I attended in MN, and NEVER have I heard Christological references made.  The story of the seder dinner is about the Passover, and it was never made to mean anything more.  This rabbi also remarked that we are two religions separated by a common text.  Another rabbi suggested that we consider the one symbol that Jews and Christians share - that of the egg.  During the passover dinner, you use a hard-boiled egg, and of course, eggs are hunted for at Easter.  Eggs represent hope and new beginnings for both religions.    A Catholic priest glossed over why the Passion is important to the Christian faith and why the cross is such a relevant symbol to us as Christians.  A Methodist preacher discussed the historical inaccuracies of the Gospel and how Pontius Pilate the man was very different from his presentation in the Gospels.  In the Gospels, Pilate is very reticent to kill Jesus, entrusting the people with his fate.  However, historical writings portray Pilate as a man very sure of himself and quick to punish.  In the breakout sessions, the Jews in our group shared their experiences of hate, of anti-semitism.  It pained me to hear stories of children's hate - of people feeling their heads for horns, of children calling others "Christkiller".  The Jews I heard mentioned their fear of  The Passion  sparking violence against Jews by Christians.  It was pointed out by one of our discussion leaders that we as Christians believe that we are responsible for Christ's death, in that He did it to save us.  This seemed new to the Jews in the room, who have been blamed by others for Christ's death.  They said that Easter was the worst time, because kids would come back from their Good Friday services and abuse could be expected.  I can't put two and a half hours into a blog entry very well, but these were the ideas and thoughts that most struck me.  As far as this movie goes, I don't want to see it in the theatre.  I haven't seen any Jesus film in the theatre yet, and I'm going to keep it that way.  If the critics like it, I may rent it.  Really, I just don't know what to think about it.  I thought that the film was controversial because of the line Caiaphus supposedly says, "It is we who have done this".  Really, the whole idea of the Passion is what makes Jews uncomfortable beacuse of the abuse and acts of hatred they associate with it.  Well, I can only speak for what I heard.  I am glad I was able to participate in such a dialogue, although I didn't speak at all in the small sessions.  It was very educational, and somewhat paining at the same time.  I can only hope that the dialogue continues.

It's pretty awesome, even with the Lenny Kravitz in the background.  Derek wrote  urlLink Weddings on the Brain  for  Alternet .  It's a very well-written reflection on gearing up for his own wedding and witnessing the gay weddings in SF:  "it was right at that moment of stress, right as I was starting to panic about all the wedding details, that Heather and I went to the San Francisco City Hall to watch gay people get married."    Also of interest,  urlLink San Francisco sues the state  "on the grounds that laws defining marriage as between a man and woman illegally discriminate against gays and lesbians".  More power to them.

You can be 90 years old, but if you can go out and play, they'll respect you. Katie was not only a girl, she was terrible. O.K.? There's no other way to say it.'"  K told me about this falderal last night.  How horrible for Katie.  I find it interesting that she came out with her story to  Sports Illustrated  of all magazines.  I'm sure they cover women in sports seriously, but they do a swimsuit issue, you know.    I wonder what this coach was thinking as he made his comments.  Did he not recall that Colorado has a female president? I don't know much about this guy, but apparently there was a lot going on that was problematic in Colorado's football program.  I'm glad they're working to clean it up, and that Katie was able to tell her story.

      Yesterday on NPR they did a story on the anniversary of one of the worst years in music, 1974.  I don't know if I agree, but there were some pretty awful tunes that came out that year (not that I remember - I wasn't born yet).  Anyway, they played a bit of "Mockingbird", the doomed duet between Carly Simon and James Taylor, saying that it was lampooned in a few films.  Now I know I've seen one that does it in a subtle way, but I can't think of which film it is! It is driving me nuts.  If you know what film includes the quote: "Mock - " "yeah" "-ing-" "yeah" "-bird." "yeah" then please let me know.  I'm thinking it was a recent Pixar movie.  But maybe not.  Help!  edit: Here's a  urlLink link  to the story, where they play a snip of the song (and other disasters) from 1974.

       Well, I  did  want to see this film. . .  urlLink New York Times review of  Iron Jawed Angels   I love the story of the suffragists, but apparently this film is too "Hollywood" to tell the true story.  I hope people don't watch this film and get the wrong idea.  Damn.  I was really looking forward to the movie, but if they aren't going to give Alice Paul a realistic portrayal, I don't know if it's even worth my time.  According to the review, they add a romantic interest for Alice Paul to soften her up a little.  Seriously! I saw it in the ads, but I don't know enough about Alice Paul's personal life to attest to whether she had a romantic interest or not. . .  I guess I'll have to wait til Ken Burns makes a documentary on her.

        urlLink NPR : Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Live in Studio 4A  This group was my first concert ever.  I went with my mom when I was in fifth grade to see them at the Bass Concert Hall.  I still remember their performance, because it was so dynamic.  They sang and danced on the stage, and it was wonderful.  I can't believe they've been around for forty years! If you're not familiar with their sound, then click on one of their songs on the NPR site.  You may have heard them and not realized it, as they sang backup for songs on Paul Simon's  Graceland  album ("Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes" and "Homeless", for example).

Then I see  urlLink The Simpsons  last night, wherein Marge tells the kids the stories of Henry VIII, Sacagawea, and W. A. Mozart.  Seeing the Simpsons version of the story of Henry VIII was that more funny after reading Gregory's book.  I must say the episode last night was the funniest I've seen in a while.

       Those crazy frog-eating triplets   So - I saw  urlLink The Triplets of Belleville  last night with M.  I don't think I got it.  I mean, as a work of art, it is amazing, but as a story, it's not so great.  The characters are basically caricatures, and there's very limited dialogue.  The music is neat, and I loved the depiction of Glenn Gould at the beginning - it is dead on.  It was quite humorous in places, but the ending disappointed me.  It was such a let-down; I turned to M and said, "That's the end?!"  The only characters with personality are the grandmother and the dog, and maybe the triplets.  The man they are trying to save is devoid of any life - he stares vaguely and unblinkingly into space.  The gist of my review is - as a study of European animation it is worth checking out, but otherwise I can't recommend it.  Wait 'til it comes out on DVD.  On another note - we got to view the Disney-Dali collaboration short  Destino , which was breath-takingly beautiful.  I'm not the biggest fan of Dali, but I was just amazed at what he came up with.  If you can find this in your area, I strongly recommend viewing it.  It is simply fascinating (and the music isn't bad either).  It was funny; when they announced that we would get to view this short before the French film, this one guy in the audience gave an ecstatic cheer.  I have to say - I would now do the same.

        urlLink Ellen Taaffe Zwilich   The last entry to my focus for the month of March (a woman a day for Women's History Month) is Ellen Taafe Zwilich.  Unless you are involved in the world of 20th Century (now 21st Century) music, you may not be familiar with Zwilich.  My limited knowledge of her music began in college.  My junior year I took a class on 20th Century music, where we only focused on Western European/American male composers.  We only had a semester, so this is somewhat understandable.  In our last project for the class, we got to choose a composer and/or work of music we hadn't gone over in class to research and discuss in class.  The only female composer I could find much information about at that time was Zwilich.  She really came onto the scene in 1983 when she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music.  She was recognized for her  urlLink  Symphony No. 1   (this was the work I studied).  This opus is an exploration of the first fifteen bars of the first movement.  I strongly recommend listening to it if you can.  "Many of her works have been issued on recordings, and Baker’s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians [8th edition] states: "There are not many composers in the modern world who possess the lucky combination of writing music of substance and at the same time exercising an immediate appeal to mixed audiences. Zwilich offers this happy combination of purely technical excellence and a distinct power of communication." urlLink link   Zwilich is currently on the faculty of the School of Music at  urlLink Florida State University .   -  urlLink List of her works

      I'm going through my A-Word-a-day e-mails.  I have a bad habit of not reading messages and letting them accumulate.  But I just found this quote from a 2/23 e-mail and thought I'd share:  "In science it often happens that scientists say, "You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken," and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion."   - Carl Sagan, astronomer and writer (1934-1996)

       Our satire as art  I never thought I was making art when I made my poster on the BC04 "Sloganator" (now demised).  Apparently, our posters are now considered art, at least according to this site:  urlLink ArtLex on Posters .  We're right on the same page as Toulose-Lautrec and WWII propaganda posters.  Seeing a BC04 poster in comparison with those is a bit humbling.

       urlLink      urlLink Elizabeth Blackwell  Elizabeth Blackwell was the first American female to receive a doctor of medicine degree.  A bit of trivia - she was sister-in-law to Lucy Stone.  Dr. Blackwell was involved in the abolitionist movement, and believed that women deserved equal education.  It is said she became involved in medicine because she "visited a family friend who was dying of cancer and who told her how much she had suffered from the humiliation of being treated by male doctors. This woman also mentioned that Blackwell, who had such a "love of study," would make an ideal doctor"  urlLink link .  Throughout her medical career she was met with great opposition, but perservered nonetheless.  Born in England, she moved back there for the later part of her life.  She taught at the first British college of medicine for women.  -  urlLink Hobart and William Smith's Blackwell site  -  urlLink Letter, Elizabeth Blackwell to Baroness Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron concerning women's rights and the education of women physicians, 4 March 1851.

        urlLink Gish Jen  I first read Gish Jen when I was interning at  urlLink Holt, Rinehart and Winston .  I got to read various short stories that might be used as "Connections" for well-known novels.  The first story of hers I read was "The White Umbrella".  I don't know how I can remember the title and not remember the plot, but oh well.  Her stories deal with the immigrant experience, culture clashes, and other such topics, but she manages to infuse humor into them very successfully.  A few years ago I read  Mona in the Promised Land  and enjoyed it a lot.  She says that Jewish-American authors have been a large influence on her:  "It's partly Scarsdale, and partly the sympathy I see between the Jewish and Chinese cultures. If there is one thing I hope readers come away with, it's to see Asian Americans as 'us' rather than 'other.'"  urlLink link    -  urlLink Powell's interview with Gish Jen

        urlLink Piano Returns to Berlin, Releasing Family Secret   This is a neat story, worth passing on.  edit: I forget not everyone is registered with the New York Times online.  Here's the gist of the article:  ". . . (T)he story has been a voyage of self-examination for Tessa Uys, a South African concert pianist based in London and the daughter of the German music teacher who first took the piano from Berlin to Cape Town.  "As she pored over her mother's documents last year, Ms. Uys (pronounced ace) said, she was also obliged to confront what she had always suspected about herself, a revelation for which her research into the history of her mother and the piano proved to be the key.  "Brought up in the Calvinist tradition of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa, the daughter of an Afrikaner musician and organist in his local church, she was unaware of one critical fact: her mother, Helga, was Jewish."  This South African concert pianist is sending her family's piano back to Berlin to be put in the Jewish museum after discovering one of the reasons her mother moved to South Africa was because she was banned from her piano academy for being Jewish.  Does that make sense? I thought it was neat to see this article after finishing  In the Image .

       urlLink      urlLink Madame C.J. Walker (Sarah Breedlove McWilliams Walker)   Madame C. J. Walker was a great inventor and businesswoman whose innovations have impacted the beauty-trade.  She invented a hair softener that could be used with an iron comb to straighten hair.  She created a regime of hair-care products that she called "The Walker System".  She went on to form schools of beauty, and amassed a large fortune, becoming one of the first African-American millionaires.  A few years ago, I read  urlLink The Black Rose , which is a sort of fictionalized biography of Madame C. J. Walker.  I think I checked it out because Alex Haley had started the work on it and died before finishing it.  I remember it being a very interesting book, and that's about it.  I read so many books, I'm surprised I remember this one.  I don't know if I'd recommend this book, but I strongly recommend reading up on this awesome woman.  -  urlLink Info on the Madame Walker stamp  -  urlLink Indiana Historical Society's site for the Madame C.

        urlLink Betty Friedan   Betty Friedan, whom I would call the mother of modern feminism, wrote the opus  The Feminine Mystique  about "the problem that has no name".  This book really led many women to realize their current situations and started what gender studies historians term the second wave of feminism (we are supposedly in the third wave now).  In her work, Friedan explored the lack of opportunities available to women in post-World War II America.  During the war, women had taken over factory jobs and sales jobs that had been vacated by men who left to fight.  All of a sudden, society accepted women working in atypical roles: building materials for war, flying planes, etc.  When the men came back from war, however, the women lost their jobs and were relegated back to the "homefront".  Betty Friedan later helped to found the National Organization for Women (NOW) and served as the first president of the organization.  She still serves as a voice for feminism and women's rights more than forty years after the publishing of her influential work.  -  urlLink About Betty Friedan  -  urlLink Atlantic Monthly: Mystique of Betty Friedan  -  urlLink Introduction to The Feminine Mystique

She died at the young age of 25, and Clark adopted her two children.  Some believe that another woman who died 70-some-odd years later was the  real  Sacagawea, but historical documents disagree with this.  When I was a kid, I remember reading a series of books that espoused certain values while giving biographies of famous people in history.  I think the only one I still own is about Louis Pasteur.  Anyway, I remember reading the ValueTale of Sacagawea.  I couldn't find an image of it on amazon.  Perhaps none of these books are still in print? That's a sad loss.  -  urlLink  Here is another, slightly more detailed, bio of Sacagawea . - Her  urlLink page  on about.com

Here's a quote:  "Is "the future of the human race threatened by gay marriage"? That's not what I hear Jesus saying. And Jesus is, by and large, pretty clear. I hear Jesus saying that the future is imperiled by greed, by prejudice, by bigotry, by hatred and by violence. I hear Jesus calling you and me to heal those deep wounds and invite the diverse human family to a feast of love, fellowship and grace. I hear Jesus singing a tune of joy and love and welcome and affirmation. I'm not sure which bible they're reading these days - but it's not the one I'm reading."  Please go read it.  If this is going to be an issue, I don't want people who claim to be Christians speaking for all of us.  I'm all for getting the Progressive Christian view out there for the world to hear.

Mary Wollstonecraft is probably best known as the mother of Mary Shelley (author of  Frankenstein ) and for writing  urlLink The Vindication of the Rights of Women .  Ms. Wollstonecraft was raised in a society where married women were treated as property and girls learned to be passive and quiet.

Her life was not typical - she stayed single for a large part of her life and had a baby out-of-wedlock.  She did eventually get married, and died after having her second child, Mary, in 1797.  It is really hard to summarize such an amazing woman's life and accomplishments in a blog entry! For more information, you can read a bio  urlLink here  or  urlLink here .

        urlLink  Susan B. Anthony  Anthony was a mover and shaker in the early women's rights movement.  She became a close friend and ally to Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  She was a "spinster" who never married.  There has been much written about Ms. Anthony.  I wanted to focus on her on this primary day here in Texas.  Susan B. Anthony strived for women's suffrage, was arrested for attempting to vote, and died before women got the vote she worked her life for.  Ken Burns made a documentary about Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  If you haven't seen it yet, you can at least go to  urlLink the official site  and learn more about their work together.

        urlLink Lucretia Mott   Lucretia Mott was a Quaker activist against slavery and for women's rights.  "In America she helped organize women's abolitionist societies, since the anti-slavery organizations would not admit women as members. In 1840, she was selected as a delegate to the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London, which she found controlled by anti-slavery factions opposed to public speaking and action by women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton later credited conversations with Lucretia Mott, while seated in the segregated women's section, with the idea of the holding a women's rights convention."  Their women's rights convention, also known as the  urlLink Seneca Falls Convention , is an important moment in American history, especially where the women's rights movement is concerned.  Frederick Douglass attended, along with about 200 other people.  At this convention,  urlLink The Declaration of Sentiments  was formed.

Um, Ms. Hughes, I think any relative of a victim of 9/11 might have a problem with the campaign exploiting their pain and sorrow.  But as  urlLink Tom Tomorrow  says,   "In all seriousness, if they think it's a good idea to use the WTC site as a backdrop for ads and later, for their convention, I say let 'em. If Boy Genius thinks it's going to be a good thing for Republicans to come to New York City and trample the ground where so many died--well, let's just say I suspect that'll play about as well as most of his other election-year schemes so far."

        urlLink Maya Lin  I have only been able to view Maya Lin's works in photos and film.  I love the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and was able to see the traveling version of it when I was in elementary school (but it isn't the same).  My favorite of her works is the  Civil Rights Memorial  (this site has an amazingly powerful slideshow).  I would love to be able to view that in real life.  Maya Lin was 21 years old when her design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was accepted.  After working on that and the Civil Rights memorial, she stopped designing memorials.

        urlLink Marian Anderson    I am currently reading  The Time of Our Singing , a work of fiction in which the parents meet at Marian Anderson's concert at the Lincoln Memorial.  About the concert, this bio from Afrovoices says:  "The most highly publicized racial instance involving Anderson occurred in 1939 when Hurok and officials from Howard University tried to arrange a concert for her in Constitution Hall, the largest and most appropriate indoor location in Washington, D.C. The hall's owners, the Daughters of the American Revolution, sparked national protests when they refused to allow her to sing there.   "In answer to the protests, the United States Department of the Interior, with active encouragement from First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, scheduled a concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial fon April 9, 1939. The Easter Sunday program drew a crowd of 75,000 people and millions of radio listeners, and the entire episode caused the news media to focus greater attention on subsequent cases of discrimination involving Anderson and other African Americans."   Because the DAR refused Anderson's performance in their hall, Eleanor Roosevelt  urlLink wrote this letter  resigning from the DAR.  Of course, I have only had the chance to listen to recordings of Marian Anderson, but even the recordings are still very powerful.    More links :  - The Kennedy Center has another  urlLink bio  online for her. -  urlLink Here 's a link to an interview with her nephew and a fellow singer.  The Newshour also did a  urlLink special segment  on Anderson at the centennial of her birth. - Go  urlLink here  to learn more about the amazing Ms. Anderson.

       yes, I watched the Oscars I have to say that this year's Oscar ceremony was better than last.  My favorite Oscar moments, in no certain order:  - the homage to Kate Hepburn - the performance of "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" by Mitch and Mickey (the only real moment of suspense - I wondered if they would kiss or not) - Sofia Coppola winning Best Original Screenplay for  Lost in Translation  - when Sean Penn commented about WMDs in his speech - when Michael Moore made a cameo in the Billy Crystal intro video - the "boring" song sung by Jack Black and Will Ferrell  and that's about it.  I was glad  Lord of the Rings  won Best Picture, but I wish the rest of the awards could have been more spread out.  I love Annie Lennox, but I don't think that "Into the West" was the best song.  I thought the song from  The Triplets of Belleville  was sure to win, but perhaps that's because I've heard it so much on KUT.  I do think James Horner's music was deserving of his win, but part of me wanted Thomas Newman to win for the  Finding Nemo  music.  And I wanted  Capturing the Friedmans  to win Best Documentary, darn it! I guess I should check out this  Fog of War  movie when it comes out on DVD.  I already missed my chance to see a free showing of it.  At least  Lost in Translation  kicked a-- at the  urlLink Independent Spirit Awards ! I just happened to catch those on Saturday night.  They were so much fun, but would have been better live.  I didn't get to see enough John Waters.   urlLink Oscar Night: Winners List   CD of the moment: I bought  Alison Krauss and Union Station: Live  on a whim and I love it (I also bought the DVDs of  Pieces of April  and  Lost in Translation  at the same time).

       notes from Hans Blix's speech Hans Blix is a great speaker, so if you get a chance to see him, I recommend it.  I didn't start zoning out until the Q and A session (and that was because the questions asked had already been answered in the speech).  So here are my notes:  title: "Lessons of Iraq?" a war of necessity? NO. no nuclear capability as in 90s Iraq as a model democracy for MidEast "a war chosen" SH was defiant, not a danger "I feel resentment about such suspicions" - his comment on the suspicions of members of the administration Cheney's comment that the inspections were "useless at best" "yellowcake" revealed as forgery before invasion was the war predetermined? Iraqis opened themselves up since they were somewhat closed off about inspections most were destroyed already in 1991 - BCHs were.  quantities unconfirmed. SH had no incentive to cooperate:  - he didn't mind the belief that he was hiding weapons in defiance  - he was incensed and humiliated by treatment  - he viewed inspectors as possible spies justification for war?  - no nuclear infrastructure left  - human rights abuses? not an option - no authorization for intervention  containment v. pre-emptive war containment - USSR - Truman and USA - patience, resolve and kindness    Korean War - UN legitimacy valued by USA - approval of armed action    even in Gulf War first - Mid East alliance wouldn't have lasted with capture of Saddam Hussein in 90s. pre-emptive war - no signs of impending Iraqi attack.  there should be action, not war, on terrorism. "to obtain democracy through occupation is proving difficult . . ."  He made many more insightful comments that I didn't get down.  Ah well.

What a surprise!  edit: I don't know how I got tickets, because apparently they ran out this morning.  God must want me to hear Hans Blix, or maybe some spirit out in the blogosphere wants me to.  I was able to find an e-mail address through a blog entry that led me to my current ticket source, who is helping to set up the event.  Whoo hoo! Blogs are useful, after all!  The tickets are free, but I am paying for our courier service to pick them up for me.  It's worth it not to have to drive and park at UT.

       Huh? from  urlLink IMDB news : " Peter Jackson To Direct Harrowing Rape Story?    Lord Of The Rings director Peter Jackson has shocked Hollywood by tentatively agreeing to take over the harrowing tale of a teenage rape and murder victim after director Lynne Ramsay walked out. The Oscar-winning New Zealand-based movie maker, who will film  King Kong  later this year, is negotiating with producers to make Alice Sebold's novel  The Lovely Bones  his next project. The story is narrated by the dead girl from heaven as she follows her family's attempts to deal with her gruesome death and the efforts of a detective to solve the case."   I never saw that coming.  I wonder if it will really go.  I just can't imagine how such a film would be.  The book was so small and personal, and Jackson's so epic.  Well,  Heavenly Creatures  isn't, but still.

       Rainy days and Mondays always get me down . . . especially a stormy weekend before my birthday.  I saw Mindy Smith last night at a very crowded concert.  She was great, although I couldn't hear the first part of the concert because apparently, people like to socialize at free concerts.  Towards the end, Mel and I gave up our horrible seats on a fencepost to stand (in a crowd actually listening to the artist!) where we could see and hear her.  So the only song I really missed was "Jolene", because we were able to hear "Come to Jesus" and "Falling".  She sang a version of Gershwin's "Summertime", saying, "He's still the shit."  Guess who was the only one who hooted for that? Yeah, I'm a nerd.

        urlLink  Happy Earth Day!  This is a day that is close to my heart (and my birthday).  When I was in high school, I was the lone Earth Day nerd.  I made banners and stamped people's hands with my Mary Englebreit "Hurt not the Earth" stamp.  Senior year I had a group of people help me with the banner.  I think that banner is in a closet at my parents' house.  So here's how I celebrate it now - by telling you to go to this site and figure out how you can help the environment in any way.    Here are the little things I do:   - take cloth bags to the grocery store  - recycle plastic bags/plastic/glass/paper/aluminum  - buy gas in the early morning or mid-evening  - carpool (when possible)  - drive a fuel-efficient car  - conserve gas by running errands in one trip   - keep the water off when I brush my teeth  - give old clothing/CDs/books/videos/other such items to Goodwill instead of throwing them out  - buy organic food when possible/cost-permitting  - always cut plastic six-pack rings (I've even done it to ones I've found on the street)  That just gives you an example on small things you can do to help the Earth.  Go to the site and check it out, and enjoy your day today.

       not Pope Alexander I realize that I saw  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  weeks ago and never wrote about it here.  I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did.  I mean, Jim Carrey! Ugh! I loved it, though.  The music is wonderful, the lighting fits the picture, the acting is great, the writing amazingly good, blah blah blah.  I love the surprises they throw at you and adore the order (disorder?) of the film.  You think you've got it all figured out, but you don't.  It is definitely the best mainstream film I've seen so far for 2004.  Sidenote - I guiltily admit I want to see  13 Going on 30 .  Jennifer Garner has become one of my favorite current actresses through her work in  Alias .  I like her enough that I went to see  Daredevil  when it was out.

      I started this in response to a  urlLink comment  on  urlLink The Weblog :  Adam K - I only saw "Shattered Glass", so I'm far from an expert on Stephen Glass.  I did take away from the film that it is harder and harder for journalism to stay "serious".  Our media has become so sensationalized that Stephen Glass could provide TNR with stories full of lies until one person decided to research an article.    Even with this aspect of our culture, though, I find your last line confusing.  If you want to simplify it like that, so that fiction is "lies", and non-fiction "truth", I think a large part of the reading population would disagree.  I guess I can only speak for myself though.  I choose to read fiction because the world becomes too much.  Because I am surrounded by liars and cheats in the world (well, my political spectrum anyway), I prefer to retreat to a world of fiction.  I don't find such escape in non-fiction.  Non-fiction does interest me, but the stuff I choose to read tends to get me riled up.  Of course, some fiction does that for me too.  I don't think you should be so quick to dismiss fiction as passe because it is "lies".  I have found truths in certain works of fiction that never would have struck me in non-fiction.

        urlLink FAIR ACTION ALERT: CNN to Al Jazeera: Why Report Civilian Deaths?  Apparently CNN had the opportunity to interview Al Jazeera's editor-in-chief, wherein he was asked about the relevance of the civilian deaths as compared to the story of the insurgents.  Why wouldn't innocent civilians being killed be a story? FAIR argues, "Especially in light of official U.S. denials of civilian deaths, video footage of women and children killed by the U.S. military is evidence that needs to be seen."  Here's the kicker:  "independent journalists reporting from Fallujah have described a scene consistent with the one broadcast by Al Jazeera. Rahul Mahajan, a U.S. journalist in Fallujah, estimated that of the 600 Iraqis killed in Fallujah, 200 were women and 100 young children, with many of the adult male casualties also non-combatants. He reported witnessing "a young woman, 18 years old, shot in the head" and "a young boy with massive internal bleeding" at a clinic (CommonDreams.org, 4/12/04). Mahajan recounted that during the "cease-fire," "Americans were attacking with heavy artillery but primarily with snipers"-- with ambulances among the targets. The sniper activity was also reported by U.S. journalist Dahr Jamail (NewStandardNews.net, 4/11/04): "Fallujah residents say Marines are opening fire randomly on unarmed civilians and have attacked clearly marked ambulances."   "When reports from the ground are describing hundreds of civilians being killed by U.S. forces, CNN should be looking to Al Jazeera's footage to see if it corroborates those accounts-- not badgering Al Jazeera's editor about why he doesn't suppress that footage."   Go to  urlLink FAIR's alert page  to let CNN know what you think.  FAIR is the group that works for Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting.

       What I'm Watching Tonight   urlLink American Experience | Emma Goldman   Unfortunately, I don't know a whole lot about Emma Goldman, except she appears in  Ragtime  the musical (I haven't read the book) and she did some good work for women's rights.  She will be featured on  The American Experience  tonight, so I hope to learn more about this controversial woman, once named "the most dangerous woman in America".  It's on at 8pm CST on PBS ( urlLink check your local listings ).

      Last night I was watching my soap (yeah, yeah) and I saw the best ad.  It turned out to be for  urlLink Girls Inc. .  I can't find it online, but it is great.  A girl is looking at a magazine and talking about how society tells her one thing and you need to tell her another.  I'm disappointed I can't find it for you.

It is a powerful, haunting song.  You can listen to it on her site  urlLink here .  If you haven't heard it yet, you should.

       I've been lax in my  urlLink MoJo Blog -reading so I just read these posts.  Yesterday's  urlLink post  is on the 10th anniversary of the beginning of massacres in Rwanda.  The sentence that hit me the hardest (and which makes a somewhat obvious point about American/Western diplomacy) was:  "There was no interest from any of the capitals of the world to come and solve the problem, prevent it or stop it once it was in motion. We have a racist background in the white community, of saying our wars are complex, like in Yugoslavia, but black people in Africa killing each other is nothing more than tribalism."   Ouch.  It's true.    The  urlLink post  before that covers "The Passion" and anti-semitism.  Yeah, I know, it's been discussed before.  But I found this passage frightening:  "What is clear, at least according to a new Pew poll, is that people who go see the movie are much more likely than the general population to think the Jews killed Jesus. Of the people who've seen "The Passion," 36 percent think that Jews were responsible for Christ's death. (Of the general population, 26 percent think so.) Then again, most of them -- 29 percent of all viewers -- held that opinion before seeing the film. Says the intro to the poll, "Generally, there is a correlation between seeing the movie, and expressing an intention to see it, with holding the view that Jews were responsible for Christ's death. This is especially the case among younger people."  Ack!

       Condi's hair doesn't move and her gap-toothed smile sorta freaked me out.  She was reporting this stuff this morning, and she would smile as she claimed that America has a "multi-ethnic democracy that works", which was new to me.  She would smile, then realize she was smiling and straighten her face out.  I found this interesting to note.  I only half-listened to her report to the commission, because I just couldn't believe her.  I guess I'm closed-minded that way.

       I guess my WalMart boycott will never come to an end. . .   urlLink WalMart's in Washington  - a link to the Center for American Progress' compilation of WalMart's growing lobby power.  I was already boycotting WalMart because of their lousy treatment of their employees.  It is sad to me because Sam Walton was a good Presbyterian, giving scholarships to seminarians and more.  His legacy has ended, I guess:   "In 1998, the company threw off founder Sam Walton's antipathy towards influencing politics and began its campaign to take over Capitol Hill.  According to the WSJ, Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS) traveled to Wal-Mart headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., to offer advice on getting started: Increase your profile and open your wallet. As a result, "Made In America" is a thing of the past and anti-labor policies are the wave of Wal-Mart's future, with money paving the way to Washington."  I found this article through my weekly SojoMail from  urlLink Sojourners .  You can can go  urlLink here  to read a commentary on Christianity and dealing with WalMart.  "Wal-Mart is now busy trying to change its public image, but Wal-Mart needs more than a makeover. It needs accountability."  I don't really miss shopping at WalMart, as it always seemed to be too crowded, and didn't have much variety in music, movies, and more.  I was glad when a new Target moved into my parents' neighborhood (Target is a little better than WalMart as far as labor relations go), because at least the people on the east side of town had a place to go rather than WalMart.

       Thoughts on the long-lasting effects of the Bush administration  urlLink Adam Kotsko  asserts:  "Once Bush is gone, everyone will breathe a sigh of relief now that everything is "back to normal," not realizing that "normal" has been fundamentally shaped by people like Bush's advisors. With Bush gone, taxation will still be considered vaguely immoral, and progressive taxation "unfair." A substantial social wage will still be out of the question. Our public schools and universities will continue to deteriorate. Our addiction to cars will continue. The perfectly sensible policies of people like Dennis Kucinich and Ralph Nader -- and I really mean that; if you sit down and read what they're proposing, it's not a radical communist revolution by any means -- will continue to sound like pipe dreams."  I hate to admit he's right.  Even when the Democrats win in November, there is NO WAY our nation can fully recover in four years from the destruction being done be this administration.  When I say destruction, I include destruction of ideology, environment, diplomacy, homeland security, lives, employment numbers, etc.  It is going to take our nation a while to get over all this that has been done to us.

       The Known World wins the Pulitzer I've blogged  before  about this awesome novel by Edward P. Jones.  I just discovered he won the  urlLink Pulitzer Prize for fiction .  If you haven't read it already, I hope this encourages you to check it out.  It is well worth your time.  sidenote - I just finished  American Woman  by Susan Choi last week, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer.  It is about a fascinating topic, but I had to skim.  There were parts of it I really enjoyed, and parts I obviously didn't.  I don't know if I'd recommend it.

        urlLink Kurt Cobain, 10 years ago  I was never a big fan of Kurt Cobain, but I must admit Nirvana and his music had a large effect on current music.  Nirvana, along with Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and other such influential bands from the 90s, helped change the movement of rock and roll from the stagnant state it was in.  I couldn't stand the way he sang, but I have to admit his influence on rock and roll history.  The link above takes you to NPR's collection of stories on this anniversary of his death.  Sidenote: I remember junior year of high school, this one girl in my English class wrote dozens of elegies to Kurt, and asked me to read and judge them for her.  I still don't understand why.  Her poetry and my reading of it was our only connection.  This anniversary makes me wonder where she is now.

       I watched Shattered Glass last night  It's funny, when it came out, I had no desire at all to see it.  Partly, I think, because of Hayden Christiansen's excerebrose performance in "SWII: Clones".  It is a fascinating film, though.  Disturbing, enthralling, submerging, and fascinating.  It boggles the mind how people just believed so many of his fake stories.  I loved the way the film told the story.  I was even surprised at the ending (not him getting caught, I knew that would happen).  I'm keeping the film to watch with the commentary, since one his editors is doing it along with the director.  I haven't read much of  The New Republic , but I bet I used it as a reference for papers in school.

       urlLink What I watched last night.   Most of what was covered in the show I pretty much already knew.  Thanks to the record companies treating music like a corporate asset and not art, the stuff coming out now isn't that great.  Sales are also down because people are downloading music.  It was still fascinating to see, because they compared two new artists: Sarah Hudson (cousin of Kate) and the group Velvet Revolver (including two ex-G&R members + Scott Weiland of STP).  Both have new releases coming out this month.  Velvet Revolver, which is pretty much a sure hit by company standards, is indeed doing well.   urlLink Sarah Hudson , however, is not getting played anywhere yet.  And listening to the song the company picked for her single, I can understand why not.  It's pretty much a lame song, titled "Girl on the verge", with a chorus that states, "I'm a girl on the verge / of a nervous breakdown".  I mean, ugh.  The sad thing is that the other bits of songs I heard from her album sounded very decent, and pretty original.  She is a singer/songwriter, but the single they chose just doesn't work for her.  You can go to the above link to view the show and also see interviews with artists, music journalists, and company execs.

      Last night, while watching the re-run of my soap (yeah, yeah) I caught both of the TV ads from  urlLink Register and Vote .  They are very humorous, and really work.  The first one I saw has women in a bathroom commenting about a faucet that has been left on.  They just stand around and watch it, making side comments, until someone walks by and turns it off.  At first I thought it was an ad for the environment (because you know you should keep the water off while you brush your teeth), but was surprised by its intent.  The second one, and I think my favorite, has a group of people standing around and commenting about a piece of litter that someone left on the ground by the trash can.  One guy says, "well, I could pick it up", but doesn't.  So go to the site and watch them if you haven't already.  And, by all means, register and vote!!!!!

      from  urlLink The New York Times :  It's notable that women in classical music come under fire for their image, since each must create her own identity from the start. "The template is male," Ms. Walsh noted. And not only in terms of career — there are still fewer female instrumental soloists than male ones, still fewer women than men in top-flight American orchestras — but also in terms of what you wear. There is no female equivalent of a man's standard concert uniform, the tuxedo.  Of course men are also evaluated in terms of their sex appeal, but the violinists Joshua Bell and James Ehnes do not seem to be relegated to bimbo status because of their pinup images. I'm not a classical snob, but I will admit to being turned off by classical "crossover" artists.  However, since a lot of women still are unable to break into the world of mainstream classical music, I think they should use whatever options are available.  This article quotes a review of a Lara St. John concert that critiques her gown in the first paragraph.  That is ridiculous.  When a male performer is on stage, the critic won't comment, "While his performance was uplifting, his tuxedo just didn't cut it!" At least, I've never seen anything comparable.  It's just such a double standard.

      I have just learned through  urlLink Ralph Luker  that Allen Brill, formerly of the Right Christians and now involved in  urlLink The Village Gate , is leaving the blog world.  This is quite disappointing to me.  Since TVG began, I haven't been involved, but I was a reader and frequent commenter at the now-defunct Right Christians site.  Allen says in his  urlLink entry : I have been thoroughly rejected by the dominant individuals in the progressive blogosphere. I have no connections in the established church bodies or parachurch organizations. I began as one voice. That one voice is now tired and frustrated.   It saddens me that the blogosphere is losing such a voice.  I believe that the separation and dichotomy between progressive liberals/Democrats will hurt us rather than help anything.  We have progressive Christians, progressive environmentalists, liberal feminists, etc.  Surely not all Republicans agree on certain issues, but their party is just picking up steam (and money) while we bicker between ourselves on what is more important.  As a progressive Christian, I realize I am biased in my views as far as Allen and his organization are concerned.  I was excited to know that there were other Progressive Christians out there in the blogosphere.  I wish we could just get our act together and recognize that we can only benefit from diversity.  But I'm just optimistic that way.

      Here's my first official Austin entry here.  I have been hearing about how  urlLink Capital Metro  has come up with a plan for how to deal with the increase in population here and the strong need for better transportation options.  So I went to the site last week and took a survey.  You can see their plans  urlLink here .  The thing is, I live in Northeast Austin.  None of these proposals will help with east-west traffic.  They only deal with north-south traffic (which is an issue, I'll give you that).  I just don't see how these plans will be of help to me, or that I will have an opportunity to put them to use.  I'm very wary of these proposals.    I'm planning on going to an open house and/or a workshop so I can be more informed.  I think it is a great idea to use rail services (would prefer light rail!), but as  urlLink M1EK's Bake-Sale of Bile  points out  urlLink here , the Rapid Bus Routes proposed wouldn't really be much of an improvement.  Now, if Austin could get some HOV lanes, that would be a beneficial improvement.  I just don't see that happening anytime soon.

      I made a comment on  urlLink Adam K's blog  that I'd like to ruminate some more on here.  Here's my comment re Eugenides'  Middlesex : am I the only one who has already attempted to read it? I guess I am part of a small percentile that didn't get into it. Maybe all the junky pop fiction I've been reading since graduation is affecting my tastes. Since college, any time I can't get into a book by a certain time, I give up and read a new one. I do give books a good amount of time to grab my attention and interest, but sometimes, they just don't.  The last great book I read was "The Known World" by Edward Jones. That is greatness.  And I think you all would be interested in "Erasure", about a black professor who writes a blaxploitation book as a joke, and it goes on to win awards and acclaim. Before I graduated from college, I felt that I had to read a book.  Even if I felt that I wasn't getting into it, even if I thought it was bad, I would finish it.  I guess I felt that I had started it, so I should finish it.  Now I just stop.  It's my time I'm wasting, and I don't owe anyone the responsibility of reading a book I don't like.  I make the attempt, at least.  I do, however, also have a bad habit of buying books I read parts of, and putting them away for later.  I have done this with  Soul Mountain  and  Caramelo , along with other books.  I really should get to finishing them.  More than a couple of times I have read a book a third of the way through before I realized I had already read it.  Luckily, this doesn't happen frequently.  It's annoying.  edit:  urlLink  Erasure   really is a terrific satire on race and publishing in America.  It's funny, and it hurts, at the same time.  Here's a bit of the  synopsis: Avant-garde novelist and college professor, woodworker, and fly fisherman — Thelonious (Monk) Ellison has never allowed race to define his identity. But as both a writer and an African-American, he is offended and angered by the success of We’s Lives in Da Ghetto, the exploitative debut novel of a young, middle-class black woman who once visited "some relatives in Harlem for a couple of days." Hailed as an authentic representation of the African-American experience, the book is a national bestseller and its author feted on the Kenya Dunston television show. Her book’s success rankles all the more as Monk’s own most recent novel has just notched its seventh rejection.   Even as his career as a writer appears to have stalled, Monk finds himself coping with changes in his personal life. Forced to assume responsibility for a mother rapidly succumbing to Alzheimer’s, Monk leaves his home in Los Angeles to return to the Washington, DC, house in which he grew up. There he must come to terms with his ailing mother, his siblings, his own childhood and youth, and the legacy of his physician father, a suicide some seven years before. In need of distraction from old memories, new responsibilities, and his professional stagnation, Monk composes, in a heat of inspiration and energy, a fierce parody of the sort of exploitative, ghetto wanna-be lit represented by We’s Lives in Da Ghetto.   But when his agent sends this literary indictment (included here in its entirety) out to publishers, it is greeted as an authentic new voice of black America. Monk — or his pseudonymous alter ego, Stagg R. Leigh — is offered money, fame, success beyond anything Monk has known. And as demand begins to build for meetings with and appearances by Leigh, Monk is faced with a whole new set of problems.  I read it a few years ago and enjoyed it immensely.  I have to point out that it makes a big deal about "African-American fiction" as a genre, and I saw it in that section at Borders.  It was somewhat ironic.

       urlLink AP: Video Shows Iraq Wedding Celebration  Although we are being told that it wasn't really a wedding celebration that the American soldiers attacked, video coverage has been found to validate the story of the survivors: An Associated Press reporter and photographer, who interviewed more than a dozen survivors a day after the bombing, were able to identify many of them on the wedding party video — which runs for several hours.   APTN also traveled Thursday to the village of Mogr el-Deeb, 250 miles west of Ramadi, to film what the survivors said was the wedding site. A devastated building and remnants of the tent, pots and pans could be seen, along with bits of what appeared to be the remnants of ordnance, one of which bore the marking "ATU-35," similar to those on U.S. bombs. . .  The survivors agree that the wedding festivities had broken up for the night when the attack began, but they insist that there were no foreign fighters or other combatants in their group.  Thanks to  urlLink TMW , where you can also find this incredibly disturbing  urlLink entry .

The U.S. military said it was investigating. . .  "Al-Ani, the doctor, said people at the wedding fired weapons in the air, and that American troops came to investigate and left. However, al-Ani said, helicopters later arrived and attacked the area." Could things get any bleaker for us over there?

      I posted this today at the  urlLink University without Condition .  Obviously, I took religion classes in college over philosophy.  Here goes:  Although I made time to read this passage by Kristeva late last week, I really only got the gist of half of it.  Following are my limited reflections.  Kristeva thinks Dostoyevsky enjoys suffering - "As far as writers are concerned, they can extract jubilation out of it through the manipulation they are able . . . to inflict upon signs and things"(182).  Said suffering reflects "man's dependency on a divine Law, as well as his irremediable difference in relation to that Law"(185).  It was her section on forgiveness that struck and threw me the most.  She makes statements such as "any modern impreciation against Chistianity. . . is an imprecation against forgiveness" (190) and "he who does not forgive is condemned to death" (192), but what I noticed most in this mid-section of her piece is what I termed  the born-again section .  I tend to frown upon more evangelical sects of Christianity.  I believe we are saved by grace, yada yada yada.  Kristeva makes some comments that reminded me of the "born-again" philosophy, such as "forgiveness seems to say . . . I take you for a child" (204) and this paragraph: "Forgiveness does not cleanse actions.  It raises the unconscious from beneath the actions and has it meet a loving other--an other who does not judge but hears the truth in the availability of love and for that very reason  allows me to be reborn .  Forgiveness is the . . . stage at which the latter changes laws and adopts the bond with love as a principle of renewal of both self and other"(205).   I think that Kristeva is accurate in her analysis of Dostoevsky, at least from my limited experience with  Notes from Underground  and  Crime and Punishment .  I recall forgiveness being quite significant in  CandP , but not so much in  Notes from Underground .  Of course, I read both of these in high school, so my memories aren't too clear; I've probably read over a hundred books since then.  I just find it interesting that she makes it seem that Dostoevsky advocated such a welcoming form of forgiveness, that one can be born again through it.  From my experience attending a Southern Baptist school for a good part of my life, I have to read that into her statements.    Then later on she comments, "Because it is forgiveness, writing is transformation, transportation, translation"(217).  So writing is forgiveness, which is given through Christ, and causes us to be born again.  Alrighty then.  Can we read some more fiction now?

      I remember when I first read Lucy Grealy's   urlLink Autobiography of a Face  .  I was a high-school senior, visiting the college I would later attend.  Instead of going to a lame party, I stayed in my host's room and read this work of non-fiction.  In it, Grealy writes of her childhood experiences with cancer, chemotherapy, radiation and reconstructive surgery.  It is an engrossing book and a worthwile read.  I hadn't realized that she died in 2002.  Her best friend, Ann Patchett (one of my current favorite writers), has completed a work of non-fiction about their relationship.  You can read her reflections on writing it  urlLink here .  The book is entitled   urlLink Truth and Beauty: a Friendship  , and I will now have to add it to my reading list.

      I'm still feeling crappy, and now I have a cough that makes it sound like I have tuberculosis.  I just pray it's gone by Sunday.    I haven't posted on Nick Berg, because I have heard conflicting stories on the situation.  Hugo has posted on  urlLink Nick Berg, anger, and pacifism , and I read  urlLink this  from Al-Jazeera today.  After seeing a story on CBS Evening News last night about Berg and his reasons for being in Iraq, I am befuddled.  The story said that he was being questioned by the FBI because he and Moussaui shared an internet password.  I think that's just ridiculous, if that's all there is to it.  Anyway, it is sad that Berg lost his life in such a manner, but I can't really have an educated opinion on it until I get the truth from someone.

      As a feminist, I am always interested in different portrayals of women in film through the years.  I've seen way too many films, and you'll have to believe me on this.  One thing that astounds me is the fact that even in contemporary films, bad girls get killed off.  Last night I was watching  The Spitfire Grill  on HBO (**spoilers coming**) and thought, oh, here's a film about a girl getting a second chance.  The main character went to jail for killing her abusive stepfather (thereby making her a bad girl).  She comes to this small town in Maine and lifts up the spirits of the townspeople around her.  Even though she's got this going for her, she ends up dead in the river.  When the movie wanted me to cry (I can tell these things) I was just angry that they decided to kill her off.  Which reminded me of . . .   Butterfield 8  starring Elizabeth Taylor.  She plays a call-girl who falls in love with one of her customers.  He's married and won't leave his wife, so she decides to give up her her profession.  She reconciles with her momma, is on her way to being a "good girl" again, but in the end is killed in a car crash, attempting to escape from her jilted married lover.    In both of these films, a "bad girl" is on her way to reconciliation with society.  She is working for redemption.  I believe that as these characters are killed off, redemption is denied.  Ultimately, they were just "bad girls".  "Thelma and Louise" differs because although the main "bad girl" characters dive to their deaths in the Grand Canyon, it is their choice to do so.  If they didn't drive off the cliff, they would be captured, and ultimately killed anyway, if Arizona has a death penalty.  Nevertheless, redemption was never an option.  I guess one could view the killing of the rapist as a sort of redemption, but I don't think society will give them that.  I've seen more movies than I'd like where the bad guys find redemption through a good woman, a relationship with a son or daughter, etc.  Why is it that Hollywood won't afford the same option to our "bad girl" characters?

      I'm having my bi-yearly allergy attack, so I'm off work today.  I just finished watching  Elephant  and it left me very shaken.  I knew the plot, and it still freaked me out.  It seems such a simple, well-shot film, but it is so much more than that.  And the thing that really hit me about the film was the lack of judgement made in it.  There is no answer at the end of the film.  It leaves you to decide what you want about it (I love when films do this).  The "bad guys" are portrayed as equally as the "good guys".  I just don't know what else to say.  I think everyone should see it.  It's worth watching just for the school building itself.  I was amazed at the length and breadth of the school.  But I went to a poor(er) inner-city school that was much smaller.  And why were the halls so void of people in the film?   Anyway, this film definitely left me thinking (and made me reminiscent for the days I could use the school darkroom).

        urlLink Eisner's Fantasyland Excuse for Censorship  from FAIR:    "On the television network that his company owns, Disney CEO Michael Eisner dismissed the idea that forbidding Disney subsidiary Miramax to distribute a controversial new documentary by Michael Moore was a form of censorship. 'We informed both the agency that represented the film and all of our companies that we just didn't want to be in the middle of a politically-oriented film during an election year,' he told ABC World News Tonight (5/5/04), referring to Moore's Fahrenheit 911, which examines the connections between the Bush family and the House of Saud that rules Saudi Arabia.   "On its face, Eisner's statement will have a chilling effect. A major movie studio with an announced policy of only releasing apolitical films, in an election year or any other year, will discourage filmmakers from tackling important themes and impoverish the American political debate. (That Moore and Miramax were given advance warning of this policy hardly mitigates its censorious impact.)   "But Eisner's statement cannot be taken at face value, because Disney, through its various subsidiaries, is one of the largest distributors of political, often highly partisan media content in the country-- virtually all of it right-wing."  I didn't realize that most all of Disney's radio stations broadcasted Limbaugh.  You can go the link above to read the examples of Disney's right-wing media content.

       My thoughts on the questioning of Rumsfeld  Well, I was trying to work and listen to the questioning at the same time, so I don't know how much I actually caught.  What I did note:  - that Senator from Maine has the most ANNOYING voice ever.  My boss pointed out that maybe she was reading.  I think that makes it worse! Can you imagine listening to a speech she made in Congress? I'd fall asleep! I kept waiting for her to get to the point, and it took forever for her to do so.  I was surprised to discover she's a Republican.    - Mark Dayton rocks! I voted for him while I still lived in Minnesota, and I'm so glad I did.  He really socked it to those guys.  - I was not surprised at the evasiveness of the Secretary.  However, I was surprised to hear him admit that it might be best for the country for him to resign.  I think he said, "That might be the case" or something to that effect.  But he doesn't think it's needed at this time.

      From  urlLink This Modern World , I find that: "The chief of the U.S. Selective Service System has proposed registering women for the military draft and requiring that young Americans regularly inform the government about whether they have training in niche specialties needed in the armed services.   "The proposal, which the agency's acting director Lewis Brodsky presented to senior Pentagon officials just before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, also seeks to extend the age of draft registration to 34, up from 25."  His source is  urlLink an article from the Toronto Star .  This is ridiculous.  I am against the idea of a draft in any way, shape, or form, with women, without women, up to 25 or 50.  I don't care.  What a mess we have gotten ourselves into, that this is even being looked into at all.

       Ted Rall's coming under fire for yesterday's cartoon.  I even am somewhat conflicted about it.  Here's the  urlLink cartoon  and the  urlLink reasoning  behind it.  I have to disagree with his statement that Bush is evil.  I don't think he's evil - I think he's stupid, ignorant, holier-than-thou, and more, but evil, no.  His intentions may be close to evil, but I don't think he is.  Anyway, I basically agree with Rall, but his feelings are a lot stronger than mine.  I guess that's how I would characterize it.

       two entries related to TMW in one day!  urlLink We haven't forgotten, Mr. Rove!   Wherein Ambassador Wilson reflects on a passage from his book that says, "According to my sources, between March 2003 and the appearance of my article in July . . . the workup on me that turned up the information on Valerie was shared with Karl Rove, who then circulated it in administration and neoconservative circles."  He notes in the interview, "Cliff May, who wrote for the National Review online, suggested in a matter of days after my article appeared and a leak appeared, that it was widely known in Washington that my wife worked for the CIA. It was not widely known. None of my friends, for example, knew it. So it's hard to believe that it was widely known unless somebody else put that story out."  Very interesting.  But I thought that this wasn't a story anymore - I mean, the networks aren't covering it.  There are many things the Bush administration hopes we don't pay a lot of attention to, and I know this is one of them.

       Irony or hypocrisy, whichever Yesterday while at the gym, I read my new issue of  Mother Jones .  I was especially interested by the  urlLink article  which discussed the "lightness" of blogs.  The author seems to think that political blogs should not be taken seriously.  He did admit to being addicted to blogs, but then goes on to dismiss them.    Why did this article interest me so? Well, first of all, I keep a blog (really two) and I do depend on blogs and other internet news sources for my news (along with NPR).  I don't read the newspaper, except for the alternative weekly which I don't really get for the news articles.  Second of all, as you can tell by my blogroll and previous entries,  Mother Jones  has a  urlLink blog ! I read it often and take what I read there quite seriously.    Do they not take their own blog seriously? If so, why have one at all? I wait to be enlightened.  If anyone saw this article and read it differently, please let me know.

       urlLink from the New York Times : As someone who believes Jesus Christ can be seen even in the grimy faces of those living in the city's shadows and crawl spaces, Police Officer Eduardo Delacruz says he obeyed a higher authority when he refused to arrest a homeless man in November 2002.   On the beat, however, the police commissioner trumps the Almighty, as Officer Delacruz learned when he was suspended for his action. Charged with refusing to comply with a lawful order, he faces a departmental trial in late July that could cost him his job and pension. I found this article through  Sojourners .  I can't believe it. A spike in arrests of homeless people in the fall of 2002 led advocates and civil libertarians to sue the Bloomberg administration, contending that the police were singling out the homeless. Over one month that ended in mid-November that year, the police arrested 580 homeless people, compared with 288 over the same period the previous year, on charges from sleeping in public to assault. The city settled the lawsuit by instructing the police not to focus on homeless people when enforcing violations.  Advocates for the homeless are stunned that the department would seek any further punishment of Officer Delacruz beyond the suspension.  "They're going to go to trial on that?" asked Doug Lasdon, the executive director of the Urban Justice Center, an advocacy group for the poor. "They're going to make this guy a hero." Seriously. There's more: Officer Delacruz said he was not opposed to arresting homeless criminals: his first arrest was a homeless man who jumped a turnstile. And he would arrest anyone who posed a danger of violence. But he said someone just down on his luck was not a criminal. That was why he thought his unit's original mission of helping the homeless find services was a noble cause.   "My position in life is to treat people like I want to be treated," he said. "That's what Jesus taught. That's what I instill in my children ."  (emphasis mine)

       urlLink Inside North Korea    Last night I caught this story on the NewsHour.  It was all-around fascinating, but what struck me was the part filmed in the schools.  It showed four students talking in English.  The reporter says:  since they are barred from outside television, the Internet and unauthorized contact with the outside world, their English is literal, not conversational. Then the students' discussion is heard.  They stand around and smile at each other, talking about picnicking in Italy.  It was just so ridiculous.  The hospital scenes were pretty awful.  Instead of eye patches, the doctors had to improvise and use pieces of film and fabric.  It was incredible. Modern equipment taken for granted in western hospitals are nonexistent. In the Ophthalmology Department, there is no digital technology, few, if any, computerized instruments. Resident doctors like Tang Chol So are always improvising. There are no spare parts for the old examining tools. They often fix the instruments themselves, trying to make them perform beyond their original design. Dr. Tang treated eye injuries during the recent rail explosion that claimed more than 100 lives. Such a view inside North Korea is extremely rare, so I was lucky to catch the report.   Mother Jones  did a story about North Korea about three months ago, but it's not the same.

      I'm going to link to an old  urlLink post  I did in March for Women's History Month about Susan B. Anthony.  After seeing  Farenheit 9/11  I am even more assured in my belief that we need to get Bush out of DC.  Send him back here to Texas, that's fine.  He can stay in Crawford and work with the armadillos on his ranch (although as we know from the movie, he'll probably end up being an advisor to BIG OIL).  Even if you hate Bush, and don't think much of Kerry,  you still need to vote .  Vote for the lesser of two evils, vote for Nader, vote for the libertarian candidate, I don't care.  I'd prefer if you voted Democrat, but  get out and vote .  I have no patience for people who don't vote, then complain about the leadership of this country.  As far as I'm concerned, they have no leg to stand on.  I don't care if you're jaded about the electoral process (which I am also) or hate that big money controls both parties (which I do also).   You still need to vote .  I went to dinner with my friend Michael about six months ago and we discussed politics.  He complained about the USA and the fact that everyone hates us now.  I asked him if he voted, and he told me he didn't.  I can't remember what I responded with, but I was thinking, "then you can't really bitch about it, can you?"  Hopefully this upcoming election will not be as close as the last one (and Florida won't have so many issues).  But if it is, who knows but your vote might make a difference.  Perhaps I am too idealistic, or maybe I just have a low tolerance threshold about this kind of thing.  But I think you get what I'm trying to say.  Women fasted in jail so I could go vote.  People died in the South working for the right for others to vote.  I'm voting, damn it. [/rant]

       urlLink 'Fahrenheit 9/11' Sets Documentary Record  Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" took in a whopping $21.8 million in its first three days, becoming the first documentary ever to debut as Hollywood's top weekend film.  If Sunday's estimates hold when final numbers are released Monday, "Fahrenheit 9/11" would set a record in a single weekend as the top-grossing documentary ever outside of concert films and movies made for huge-screen IMAX theaters. I spent most of Friday trying to get tickets for that night's showing of this film at the Arbor, but all shows were sold out by 3:30pm.  We ended up seeing it at Tinseltown Pflugerville at 10pm.  It sold out also - the theatre was full despite the torrential rain.  It is an amazing film.  It is so funny in parts, and so incredibly sad in others.  I'd agree with those who say it's like two separate films.  The first part is like a typical Michael Moore film, but as soon as the analysis of Iraq starts, he moves out of the film.  The part with the soldier's mom was the hardest for me to watch.  I wanted to bawl when she read the letter he wrote his family a week before his death.  It was neat to see it with such a huge crowd.  There were about five times during the film where everyone clapped.  I have to recommend it to anyone.  It is worth seeing for film-history reasons as much as political.

      What I learned from the free showing last night of  Baadasssss!  :  1. Bill Cosby helped finance the last stages of filming for  Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song . 2. Melvin van Peebles had to use p*rn filmmakers, because they weren't unionized.  I think that was the reason.  He also wanted a decent minority representation on the crew. 3. Earth, Wind and Fire did the soundtrack. 4. There is a whole lot of nekkidness and cussin' in 'SSBS'. 5. I now have no desire to see same film.  Although I really enjoyed  urlLink Baadasssss! , it didn't really make me feel like I need to see the film it documents.  It is a semi-comic tale of the making of Melvin van Peebles' historical work.  Mario, his real-life son, plays his father.  I love the combination of story and interviews, especially the real interviews during the credits.  David Alan Grier is hilarious, and there are a few scenes that had me cracking up.  I'd strongly recommend at least renting the film, if you can't catch it in the theatre.  Be prepared for scenes "of a graphic nature", and enjoy!

      This story in the  New York Times  today is fascinating.  I hope that these enterprising women can get an organization together.  Apparently, houses of single immigrant men in the Northeast are hiring immigrant women to come cook for them.  I got sucked into the story by the picture of the soup.  Yum. Inside the overcrowded immigrant homes that speckle New York's suburbs, Hispanic women like Ms. Gress-Escamilla have begun to forge their livelihoods. The women call themselves cocineras, or cooks, a disparate door-to-door army that brings a taste of home to men living far from their wives and mothers. These women make dinner, overhear secrets, console those who cannot find work and quickly get used to grown men calling them madre, or mother.  "They're people from my hometown," Ms. Gress-Escamilla said in Spanish, through a translator. "You get to know them and have a sense of family with them. They need to eat."  So after the men leave for their long days of work, the women arrive and head toward the kitchen. They make soup, a main course, rice and beans and maybe a dessert or empanadas if someone is celebrating a birthday. They set the dishes on the stove to be warmed later, slip out the front door and move on to the next house.  The homes are flung far across the suburbs, and the women sometimes work for weeks without pay.  But the payments are in cash, the women do not have to speak English, and they can grasp at their dreams of independence from bosses and night shifts at fast-food restaurants. "I am my own boss," said one cocinera, Josefa Barrera-Rios.   ( my emphasis )  urlLink The New York Times > New York Region > Far From Mother, a Mother's Touch

An expose of the Bush administration's actions after 9/11 and in Iraq, the movie is the first documentary ever to win the grand prize in the world-famous Cannes Film Festival. The New York Times said, "Whatever you think of Moore…[these are] pictures that have been largely shielded from our view."   I'm going on opening weekend along with other members of MoveOn PAC.

       urlLink Strategy: Bush Allies Till Fertile Soil, Among Baptists, for Votes   Ack! It doesn't surprise me, but I am still a little stunned:  President Bush's re-election campaign took its effort to enlist churches in turning out conservative voters to the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention this week, urging pastors to do everything short of risking their churches' tax-exempt status to support the president's re-election.  Mr. Bush's courtship of Southern Baptists, the largest Protestant denomination, began Tuesday when he addressed them in a live telecast from the White House and thanked them for their prayers. The campaign's appeals picked up in earnest the next day, when Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, who is now an official of the Bush campaign, arrived to ask pastors more explicitly for their help in winning votes.  Mr. Reed delivered his remarks at a Bush-Cheney "pastors reception," paid for by the Bush campaign. The hosts were the departing president of the Southern Baptists and three other prominent leaders, and the reception was in a conference room of a hotel adjacent to the convention. As the pastors came in, a campaign aide collected about 100 signatures and addresses from ministers pledging to endorse Mr. Bush's re-election publicly, to "host a citizenship Sunday for voter registration," to "identify someone who will help in voter registration and outreach" and to organize a " 'party for the president' with other pastors" on specific dates closer to the election.  As the pastors mingled around fountains of soft drinks and trays of cubed cheese, Mr. Reed urged, "Without advocating on behalf of any candidate or political party, you can make sure that everyone in your circle of influence is registered to vote."  Mr. Bush's political advisers often repeat their belief, Mr. Reed reminded the pastors, that about four million conservative Christian voters did not vote in the last presidential election. The campaign is determined not to let that happen again.  And the leaders of the 16 million Southern Baptists have already organized what they say is the first major voter registration drive in their history, beginning at the annual meeting.   But as the Bush campaign escalates its appeals to conservative Christian churches, experts in election law say, it is inviting pastors toward potentially treacherous terrain where letting personal endorsements spill over into the business of their churches can jeopardize their tax-exempt status.   "It is pushing the line," said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics and the former general counsel to the Federal Election Commission. "It goes to the question of, 'How often can you switch hats?' "   The dividing line in the tax laws gets even blurrier, Mr. Noble said, when the same pastors are also engaging in their clerical capacity in churchwide voter-registration drives that are officially nonpartisan. And the line can become blurrier still, he added, if the church officials are specifically directing their messages to partisan voters - if, for example, Southern Baptist leaders believe that most of their members are likely to vote Republican.

      MoJo Blog had a lot of informative entries yesterday, but the one that interested me most was  urlLink this one  on the study of a dead zone off the coast of Oregon: Specifically, scientists studying a "dead zone" -- an oxygen-starved area of the ocean where marine life has vanished -- off the Oregon coast appear to have established a link between the phenomenon and shifts in ocean currents caused by climate change. This affects us, people.  How much longer will this administration ignore the environmental damage being done? I think it will be ignored until it is too late.

      I'm sure you've probably already read it by now, but I just discovered this article by Kurt Vonnegut (because it was quoted in my  Sojourners  newsletter).  Here's my favorite part (with my emphasis): Eugene Debs, who died back in 1926, when I was only 4, ran 5 times as the Socialist Party candidate for president, winning 900,000 votes, 6 percent of the popular vote, in 1912, if you can imagine such a ballot. He had this to say while campaigning: As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I'm of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.  Doesn't anything socialistic make you want to throw up? Like great public schools or health insurance for all?  How about Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes?  Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. ...  And so on.  Not exactly planks in a Republican platform. Not exactly Donald Rumsfeld or Dick Cheney stuff.   For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that's Moses, not Jesus. I haven't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere.   "Blessed are the merciful" in a courtroom? "Blessed are the peacemakers" in the Pentagon?

       urlLink MoJo blog  has an insightful post reflecting on a recent study on the gender gap.  Here's the kicker: "Between 1983 and 1998, women on average earned only 38 percent of what men did." Gosh, I'm so glad there is no need for feminism anymore.  Obviously, women are receiving the equal rights and equal pay they deserve.  Here's a  urlLink link  to the NYTimes article covering the study.  and God bless America! (/sarcasm)

      My boss just handed me  urlLink this  opinion column to read, after we had talked about the Reagan funeral coverage at break.  We wondered how Carter's funeral will stack up to it (heaven forbid he die anytime soon), and how Ford's funeral might be treated.  As neither of these presidents is viewed as a diety by either party, it's doubtful they will receive the over-extensive coverage Reagan did.  My favorite quotes:  "I refer, in case my drift goes uncaught, to the fulsome media tributes that have attended the former president's death. Not just fulsome, but uncritical, bereft of balance, lacking perspective. If all you knew of Ronald Reagan is what you saw on newscasts or read in the initial coverage from USA Today, The New York Times, The Washington Post or The Miami Herald, you'd think him a cross between Wilford Brimley and John Rambo, a twinkle-eyed grandfather with a fondness for jelly beans who single-handedly saved America, kicked the Commies in the butt, and maybe even found a cure for the common cold while he was at it. You'd never know about what he said in Mississippi."  "So let me say this for the record: Some of us watch these proceedings with the sober respect you'd have for any loss of life, but also with dry eyes. The media have sold us a fraudulent version of history. Everybody loved Ronald Reagan, it says.  "Beg pardon, but ''everybody'' did not."  Thanks for saying what I was thinking, Mr. Pitts!

      I started this post yesterday, but couldn't post it b/c we closed early:  Hector Mondragon was tortured over 20 years ago in Columbia.  In this  urlLink article , he points out that those who torture are still human:  Torturers are not "a few bad apples" who just need to be thrown away or have the rotten piece cut off. They are human beings who have been converted into instruments of the system of economic exploitation and oppression. None of them came to be this way on their own. Condemning a few of them to jail might be "fair," but it is not going to stop the nightmare.  He asserts: I feel in heartfelt communion with the terrible pain and humiliation of these tortured prisoners, but I also find this communion with the disgrace of the torturers and their human misery. I think that we all deserve redemption from this system of death and reconciliation to our dignity as human beings.  Amen, Hector!

      I was at  urlLink CD Universe , just looking around, when I saw  urlLink this  on their Top Seller list.  I couldn't believe it.  A new CD by this group? And all covers of "California pop songs". . . I thought it was bad enough to be found singing along with one of their 90's hits in a dress store.  I did love their harmonies though.  I'm attempting to put together a themed summer CD for  urlLink Charlie's  summer CD swap.  I think I've decided on "Songs from Summers Past".  It looks to be quite a variety, and will include one Backstreet Boys song, I think.  Just because I can.  No, really, there's a story behind it.

      text from a  urlLink speech  Julian Bond, the current president of the NAACP, gave at a recent conference.  My favorite parts:  About conservative Republicans (with my edits): "They preach racial neutrality and they practice racial division. They celebrate Dr. King and they misuse his message. . . Their idea of a pristine environment is a parking lot before the lines are painted in.  . . Their idea – their idea of compassion is to ask the guest at the millionaire’s banquet if they want an extra helping or a second dessert. They’ve tried to patch the leaky economy and every other domestic problem with duct tape and plastic sheets. They’ve written a new constitution for Iraq and ignored the Constitution here at home. (Applause.)"  About Democrats (emphasis mine): "And what about the opposition party? Too often they’re not in opposition; they’re an amen corner. With some – (applause) – with some notable exceptions, they’ve been absent without leave in this battle for America’s soul. (Applause.) When one party is shameless, the other can’t afford to be spineless. (Applause.) These economic imbalances not only mean difficult times for many, they also undermine democratic values.  The danger is that plutocracy will prevail over democracy, that the free market will rule over the free citizen ."  The current administration: "We have a president who talks like a populist and governs for the privileged. We were promised compassionate conservatism; instead we got crony capitalism. We have an attorney general who’s a cross between J. Edgar Hoover and Jerry Falwell. (Applause.) And we have a Senate majority leader who has voted consistently against labor rights, against civil rights, against women’s rights, and he’s the one who replaced the bad guy."  There is more.  I wish I could have heard this speech - as powerful as it is to read, I imagine it was much more when heard.  Thanks to  urlLink Change for America  for posting it.

      I have gone  urlLink here  to view the trailer of  Vanity Fair .  As a fan of the book and the director (Mira Nair), I have to comment on the trailer.  I hope I am wrong in my perception, but it appears they have made Becky Sharp a sympathetic character.  I think Thackeray would not be too happy about it.  The only character in the book who gets off scot-free is the narrator, and perhaps Dobbin.  Becky is a gold-digger who works for acceptance in society by doing some rather devious things.  Amelia is a simpering wimp, a goody-goody who accepts what life doles out to her.  Captain Rawdon Cawley is as focused on money as his wife, Becky.  This is why the book is so great and funny.  I am afraid the movie will lack this satirical feeling.  The trailer makes it out to be a melodrama.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

      1. Reagan died.  I feel muddled about it.  He made some great quotes, and had a lot of class, but he made a lot of mistakes too.  I will say, he is in one of my favorite classic movies, entitled   urlLink One for the Book, or the Voice of the Turtle   (I kid you not, my friend).  I have about 25 favorite classic movies, and this is one of them.  You just can't go wrong with Reagan, lovely Eleanor Parker, and sharp Eve Arden.  The plot: Eleanor Parker plays a scatterbrained actress who has had problems with love.  Eve Arden is her friend who has made plans with two men for this evening.  EP takes one of the guys, a soldier on leave played by Reagan.  Of course, it's a love story, but it is slightly risque for the time period.  Anyway, you can't find it on video, but maybe TCM will play it again and you can catch it.  2. I am reading  Peyton Place .  It is extremely interesting, although very un-PC.  I've wanted to read it for a while, since it had such an effect on pop-culture.  I found it at the library on Saturday and have read 4/5 of it.  3. I went to an  amazing  church service on Sunday at Central Pres.  My family used to go there when my sister and I were very small, but I have a feeling it is more liberal now than it was then (as my father is somewhat conservative).  It was so wonderful to be able to pay attention during the sermon, and actually get something from it.  It was so inspiring - I took notes, and I NEVER do that.  Well, sometimes I write snide comments in my bulletin.  But not this time.  It just shows me all I am missing at my current church home.  If I had to choose a church right now, I think it would be this church over St. James Episocopal.  Partly because, although baptized Episcopalian, I am not used to the high church stuff they do.     update : TCM will be showing my fave Reagan movie on Thursday, June 10.  See the schedule for the day  urlLink here .  It's showing at 3:15pm my time.

       urlLink Giving Burger King Moms a voice  by Jim Wallis.  He makes an excellent point - with all our current focus on the "war on terrorism", we have left our working poor on the sidelines: "The Republicans look after their wealthy constituents, and the Democrats want to be the champions of the middle class. Neither makes a priority of the needs of the poor. Is that because the problems of poverty are disappearing in America? Hardly. The poverty rate (including that for children) has risen over the past two years. More people than ever are without health insurance. Increasing numbers of people can't find affordable housing. The minimum wage hasn't been raised for seven years." We need to work on our focus here.

       urlLink John Kerry intern scandal - Alexandra Polier's account   A very well-written, very sad story from the woman whose life was pretty much ruined by the Washington rumor mill.  My favorite paragraph (with my own emphasis): And so my education had taken me pretty much as far as it could. I started out as an ambitious young woman inspired by politics and the media. I’ve ended up disenchanted with both.  If I had been an ambitious young man, this story would not have happened.  I’m never going to know exactly what happened, but that matters less to me now. I lost a good friend and learned a few lessons. I am struck by the pitiful state of political reporting, which is dominated by the unholy alliance of opposition research and its latest tool, the Internet. Even the Wall Street Journal’s Website ran Drudge’s story, with only a brief disclaimer that his stories weren’t always accurate.

I joined because I thought it would be an educational experience as well as a neat concept, but I am feeling a tad wary of it now.  Maybe I was incorrect in my assumptions about it.

      I laughed as hard as I could, given that I am still at work.  It is hard to pick a favorite part, but it just might be this: As per your request, I sent yesterday a directory of our church membership to your campaign headquarters here in California. All addresses and telephone numbers are up-to-date, which I trust will be quite useful for your field team as they seek to make personal connections with our flock.   Our pastoral staff even put stars next to the names of those members who have given more than $1,000 to our church during the past year. We do not have an especially wealthy congregation, but as I reminded them last week in my sermon, if a poor widow can give a mite, so might we open our hearts and checkbooks to the burning Bush of Texas, whom God has led to Washington for our sakes.  ....................................................................  You will be pleased to hear that our planting of seeds already is yielding fruit. By its own inspiration, the Visitation Committee announced its plans to suspend visits to the sick and elderly for the months of October and November (except in those cases of impending death). Instead, these faithful souls will use their hours of ministry going door to door in the neighborbood surrounding the church, handing out your Voter Guides and, if God opens hearts, asking for our neighbors to volunteer for Bush/Cheney '04.   I cannot recall a time when our flock was so focused on a single mission. In no small part we have you to thank. The campaign potlucks you demanded did not even seem like a duty; after the meal, we sang songs of praise for the divine blessing given our nation under Republican leadership. Thanks be to God, I now know how the people of Judea must have felt when He bestowed on King David His eternal wisdom to guide His people in a "united states" of Israel.   This is great satire, people.  Go enjoy it.   urlLink Letter to the Bush/Cheney Re-election Campaign Headquarters

      From her NY Times opinion piece today: So here in one word is my new counterterrorism strategy for Kerry: feminism. Or, if that's too incendiary, try the phrase "human rights for women." I don't mean just a few opportunistic references to women, like those that accompanied the war on the Taliban and were quietly dropped by the Bush administration when that war was abandoned and Afghan women were locked back into their burkas. I'm talking about a sustained and serious effort.  So John and John: Announce plans to pour dollars into girls' education in places like Pakistan, where the high-end estimate for female literacy is 26 percent, and scholarships for women seeking higher education in nations that typically discourage it. (Secular education for the boys wouldn't hurt either.) Expand the grounds for asylum to all women fleeing gender totalitarianism, wherever it springs up. Reverse the Bush policies on global family planning, which condemn 78,000 women yearly to death in makeshift abortions. Lead the global battle against the traffic in women.   She goes on to say that we must first work on women's rights within the USA, mentioning the fact that  urlLink CEDAW  is still stalled in our Senate.  I don't think it can be said that women have equal rights in the USA until we get on the boat with that one.   urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Guest Columnist: The New Macho: Feminism

       urlLink The Institute on Religion and Democracy    Why am I just finding out about this organization? I have been told that members were quite present at General Assembly, and that a preacher in Austin is a member of their think tank. They have written a piece entitled "Saving the Soul of the Presbyterian Church".   From their mission statement:  In our own society, cultural trends are sapping the virtues and institutions of “civil society” necessary for democratic life. These worrisome trends include an extreme emphasis on the autonomous individual, the elevation of rights over responsibilities, a hostility toward definitive moral standards, an excessive dependence upon the state to solve all problems, and the cultivation of divisive identity politics.  Perhaps the most serious threat to American democracy comes from the fragmentation of the family, the building block of society.    Nor is democracy in a good state abroad. A large part of humankind still lives under regimes that violate basic human dignity. Hundreds of millions of religious believers suffer persecution or restrictions in the exercise of their faith. Dictators espousing communism, radical Islam,  militant nationalism , and other doctrines deny the very notion of universal human rights. By binding their peoples in political shackles, they also make it more difficult for them to rise up from poverty.   Never has there been a greater need for strong churches, as a crucial component of civil society. America and the world require a fresh impetus of Christian evangelization, transforming both individuals and cultures. Yet tragically, important segments of the American church are spiraling into deep decline as they retreat from this task. Particularly in the historic “mainline” Protestant denominations, but also in other churches, many leaders and institutions have lost their focus on the Gospel, the basis of their existence. They have turned toward political agendas mandated neither by Scripture nor by Christian tradition.  They have thrown themselves into multiple, often leftist crusades – radical forms of feminism, environmentalism, pacifism, multi-culturalism, revolutionary socialism, sexual liberation and so forth.    Not all of these causes are entirely unjust. But they have gone awry and inflicted serious damage upon the church and society. In pursuit of radical political agendas, church leaders have alienated members, undermined church structures of openness and accountability, and rendered their own ministries ineffective. They have exacerbated the social trends that they ought to have been resisting.    bolded emphasis mine, as always.&nbsp; This really creeps me out.&nbsp; I know the Religious Right is everpresent, but I just don't associate them with the Presbyterian church.&nbsp; Boy, the times they are a-changing.

      Last night I went to a showing of  urlLink THE END OF SUBURBIA , an independent documentary about how within the next 10 years, our oil resources will peak, and then we'll just be sh*t up a creek. It discussed how the suburban dream will become moot, because no one will be able to afford to live in suburbs anymore, as gas/energy prices&nbsp;will be too high.   The film made some really good points, and the room we watched it in at the History Center was  packed  with people, but towards the end it got a little too far-fetched for me. I do think this is a relevant issue, but there were people in the film saying that our world will basically go to pot in the next ten years, making all these predictions about how messed up the world will become.&nbsp;  It almost had me, and then it&nbsp;sorta lost me; it just got a little too fantastic.

      Thanks to CAMPO, toll roads have been locally approved for the Austin area in the near future.  TxDOT and the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority still have to vote on them, but I'm sure  urlLink Ric Williamson  and the rest of the Transportation Commission will vote for the toll roads.  Mr. Williamson loves the idea of toll roads.    Part of me thinks they are a good idea, but part of me doesn't.  Why don't we just heighten the gas tax, or tax SUVs more already? Eventually, we will have to, because I seriously doubt these proposed toll roads will make the money to repair themselves in the future.  It's just like a momentary fix or something.  Why are taxes bad, and tolls so good? I just don't get it.  Either way, the little people have to pay.   urlLink Area leaders vote yes on toll roads

      The president of our board just sent me an email saying she has to resign, which means I am now the president by default.  A 26-year-old middle-class gal as president of the board of a medium-size local non-profit? I am currently in shock.  At least our next meeting isn't til August, so I have some time to plan strategy.    As if I didn't have enough going on this month!

      Dear regular reader (or person who just happened upon my blog now) -   I probably will not have time to post much for the rest of July.  We're short-staffed the rest of this week, and then I head to Albuquerque the 21st through 27th.  I hope to have some intermittent posts, and also to have time to visit my regular blog reads, but as for regular steady posting - I probably won't get back to that until August.  I hope you keep visiting, anyway!  love, me.

      I'm not sure that I completely agree with this article, as I am an  Alias  addict, but I do agree with her analysis of  Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle .  Lisa Jervis makes the connection between "hot chicks kicking celluloid ass" and p*rnorgra*hy, and I think it applies in the case of the second Charlie's Angels film.  Not that I've seen it, mind you - the preview gave me enough to see.  I also haven't seen any volume of  Kill Bill  yet.  Here's the last paragraph:  The simplistic questions to ask are if these images make for good role models, and whether they're good or bad for feminism. But what we need aren't better role models, or images that can easily be labeled "good" or "bad." Once pornographic iconography thoroughly saturates women's film violence, we'll be stuck with that tired old depoliticized sexualization clouding our vision whenever we watch it. What we need is substance beyond the pornographic. What we need are conceptions of female violence that preserve the potential of the threat that our rage and our power represent.    urlLink AlterNet: MediaCulture: Decoding Hot Girl-on-Girl Action

      We are short-staffed this week, so I won't be posting much here or anywhere else.  I just want to go ahead and discuss this whole Kerry-Edwards thing.  I am not a little disappointed in Kerry for this.  I keep hoping the Democratic party will get their act together and nominate a minority or female for at least Vice-President.  Edwards is a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but he won't change anyone's mind.  I'm here in the South(west) and I can tell you, if someone was going to vote for Bush, they probably still will.  I kept praying for Bill Richardson to get the nod, but oh well.  More sometime soon, I promise.    update:  I went ahead and signed up for a  urlLink free Kerry/Edwards bumper sticker  anyway.

      Working on Saturday, again.  I just found this:  urlLink Baptists Angry at Bush Campaign Tactics  The Southern Baptist Convention, a conservative denomination closely aligned with President Bush, said it was offended by the Bush-Cheney campaign's effort to use church rosters for campaign purposes.  "I'm appalled that the Bush-Cheney campaign would intrude on a local congregation in this way," said Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission.  "The bottom line is, when a church does it, it's nonpartisan and appropriate. When a campaign does it, it's partisan and inappropriate," he said. "I suspect that this will rub a lot of pastors' fur the wrong way."  The Bush campaign defended a memo  in which it sought to mobilize church members by providing church directories to the campaign , arranging for pastors to hold voter-registration drives, and talking to various religious groups about the campaign. Maybe those Southern Baptists are smarter than I give them credit for! Good for them.  I know I'd get angry if I found that my church had given my address out to a campaign.  That just blows my mind.

       urlLink Actor Marlon Brando Dies at 80   I was never a big fan of Brando, but I do like his acting in  On the Waterfront .  I know it's a sad loss for film history, but I find it strange that I was reading about his money problems just the other day - that he was totally bankrupt and living in squalor.  I am sure the veracity of this is questionable, but his death is certain.  All these irreplaceable screen legends are dying, and we really have no comparable talent nowadays.  It's quite sad.

      I heard  urlLink this story  on NPR this morning and it reminded me that the company I work for had transcribed several interviews for this project.  Interviewees we typed included: BB King, Clarence Fountain (of Blind Boys of Alabama), Little Joe Hernandez, and more.  It's so cool to have been a small part of that - even if all I did was transfer the interviews from minidisc to audiotape.  You can see more interviews here:  urlLink Voices of Civil Rights :: The Voices .  We are currently working on an interview with Willie Nelson, but I am pretty sure that's for an unrelated project.

      Thanks to  urlLink The Living Room Candidate , you can now view campaign ads online.  This is exciting for me - I took politics classes in school and focused on media, especially television and its role in politics.  So now people of my generation can view  urlLink the ad that pretty much ruined Goldwater's chances just by existing .  "Daisy" was never actually shown as an ad, if I remember correctly.  The news media found out about it and showed it on the news.  Go view it - it's creepy scary.  Another favorite of mine is  urlLink "Bear"  from the Reagan campaign.  This one isn't scary - it's just freaky how much meaning people put with this random ad.  Here's the transcript: ANNOUNCER: There is a bear in the woods. For some people the bear is easy to see. Others don't see it at all. Some people say the bear is tame. Others say it's vicious and dangerous. Since no one can really be sure who's right, isn't it smart to be as strong as the bear? If there is a bear? If this showed now, we'd say, "Huh? Explain that to us."  I'm going to put a link to this on my side menu.  Finding this amazing online resource has made my day a little better.  edit: b/c I can't spell ruined.

      I was a music minor, if I haven't mentioned it by now (I'm sure I have).  Taking classes in music theory and history has helped me appreciate music.  I have eclectic tastes; I listen to folk, classic rock, bluegrass, opera, rockabilly, power pop, oldies, world, "real" country, Classical, Romantic, and even a good amount of 20th Century music (except Phillip Glass - urgh!).  Since my graduation, I have tried to listen to more "classical" music on the radio.  Knowing the movements that affected certain composers, I feel like I can understand more about the music.  When I was in Minnesota, I found  urlLink a classical station out of St. Olaf College  that played the best selection.  I thought when I moved back to Austin,  urlLink the station here  would be even better.  However, the station here has gotten progressively worse.  In the past couple of years, they have cut fun and educational shows like "The Basics" (which I was a huge fan of, whenever I remembered to catch it), and have increased the play of soundtracks.  Now, I like movies, therefore, I like soundtracks.  But they are not playing soundtracks like "On the Waterfront" or even "Glory"! They play "Dances with Wolves" practically every week.  They have moved to Classical Lite.  They play more popular pieces, more frequently.  I'm just so disappointed.  It frustrates me that this my only option for classical music radio here in town.  I can't afford digital radio, and I certainly can't afford to buy all the CDs of my favorite works.  Basically, I'm stuck.   urlLink Brey  has brought this (the death of classical music radio) up before, but I just had to rant on it today, as I heard the strains of "Dances with Wolves" starting up.

      I just happened upon the  urlLink manifesto (pdf file) of the Christian counterculture movement.  I was looking for lyrics to Sam Phillips' song "One Day Late" ("Help is coming/ help is coming/ one day late/ one day late"), and found a site that sells her CDs, which is affiliated with this movement.  I'm going to research more, because I'm not sure I've got an absolute grasp on their thought.  Would Christian counterculture be more conservative or less conservative than our current mainstream Christianity?   If they appreciate Sam Phillips, they can't be too conservative.  update: by sifting through a couple of their online newsletters, I find that they are indeed quite conservative.  I wonder, who set this movement up? Who is behind it? and why are they selling Sam Phillips CDs?   urlLink the christian counterculture project

      This sounds like a terrific idea.  Troops who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan are encouraged by writers and poets to put their experience down in words: The program, called "Operation Homecoming: Writing the Wartime Experience," is aimed at preserving stories from the battlegrounds of Iraq and Afghanistan. The endowment expects to hold 20 or so workshops at American military installations between now and next spring (Camp Lejeune was the second stop; the first was Fort Drum in upstate New York in June), with a formidable roster of participating writers selected by an independent panel of editors appointed by the endowment. It includes military thriller heavyweights like Jeff Shaara and Tom Clancy, as well as prominent literary lights like Tobias Wolff and Richard Bausch.   The program, which will cost about $500,000, is being paid for almost entirely by the Boeing Company. And the Defense Department (an unlikely-seeming bedfellow for the endowment, which is also providing $1 million for a program that will take productions of Shakespeare to military bases) is providing logistical services.

       urlLink CNN.com - Illinois GOP offers Senate nod to Alan Keyes - Aug 5, 2004   This is all because of Obama.  A well-spoken, well-educated, impressive African-American Democrat runs in Illinois, and the Republicans have to go fishing for a nominee to go up against him.  I do appreciate that Alan Keyes participated in Michael Moore's mosh pit, but that's really all I can say about him.  I mean, he doesn't even live in Illinois!  This idea would be scoffed at in Texas.  I just hope the population of Illinois doesn't fall for it.

      I think FAIR makes some excellent points (as usual).  The only place I knew I would get adequate coverage of the convention was CSPAN.  I basically flipped between CSPAN and PBS.  Even the commentators on the PBS coverage bugged me at times, especially David Brooks.  I missed the Al Sharpton speech, but FAIR brings up some interesting comments made after Sharpton's speech:  The MSNBC pundits were none too thrilled about Sharpton before he took to the podium, deriding his effect on the entire primary process: Chris Matthews asserted that Sharpton "probably hurt this campaign. He was a humorist. Everything was a joke." Newsweek's Howard Fineman agreed that Sharpton's campaign "was not to be taken seriously, frankly." Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin asked the panelists to "think of the contrast between Jesse Jackson in '88…. or you think of Obama the other night, last night, where he's a future candidate."  Goodwin didn't make clear why Sharpton could only be compared to other African Americans. Nor did Fineman, noting derisively that Sharpton "stayed first class wherever he went," explain where he thought Sharpton ought to have been staying on the campaign trail.    The response from the convention delegates to Sharpton's address was very enthusiastic, but MSNBC actually cut away from the speech in order to resume its panel discussion, where the pundits were having a markedly different reaction. Matthews pondered: "I have got to wonder tonight, Howard and Doris, if this is doing any good for the Democratic Party. They're trying to reach those middle 20 percent." Fineman echoed his consternation, saying he was "very surprised, given the way the Kerry campaign has tried to control and modulate this message here. They didn't need to do this tonight. African-American voters are going turn out in droves for John Kerry and John Edwards regardless. They will walk through walls for them…. He is the only guy-- he could actually turn off the black vote, yes." Goodwin concurred: "In fact, the yelling in the rally right now is like chalk on a board, a blackboard. It's grating. You can't bear to listen to it." Instead, MSNBC viewers were treated to more analysis on the order of this from Fineman: "I think, frankly, it's an insult. It's an insult, I think, as an outsider, to African-American voters that they're giving this guy as much time as they are."   Matthews finally summed up MSNBC's vision of public service: "We're doing a favor to the Democratic party right now. This is a partisan act. We've taken him off the air." The pundits shared a laugh, before Fineman added: "It's completely counterproductive to what the aim of tonight was, to introduce John Edwards as the spokesman of and tribune of rural people, moderate voters, you know, not necessarily African-Americans, who are already in the camp, already in the camp of the Democratic Party."   Interviewing Sharpton after he spoke, even NBC anchor Brian Williams appeared clueless about Sharpton's speech, referring to the "teleprompter that just sat there for what seemed like a half-hour while you did a riff on whatever you did a riff on." Has it really come down to reporters taking politicians to task for *not* just reading off a teleprompter?    The bolded sentences are my emphasis, as always.  Gosh, I just  love  our liberal media.   urlLink FAIR MEDIA ADVISORY: Covering the Convention

      This weekend a murder/suicide happened near my apartment complex, so I haven't really been thinking about much else news-wise.  It was over a girl, that's what gets me.  Her current boyfriend killed her ex-boyfriend, then shot himself.  I'm a little freaked out about it happening so close to home, as they say, but this kind of thing can happen anywhere.  Mostly, I'm just sad that it happened at all.  I'm not going to say that "any man's death diminishes me", but that statement is pretty darn close.  I've been left to introspect for a short while (and have made some posts at my other blog).  I'm sure I'll get out of it soon.
