       Wesley Clark: faster than the speed of thought!   Wesley Clark thinks that one day we will  urlLink travel faster than the speed of light and engage in time travel . Unfortunately, Clark will have to discover a way to get around those pesky  urlLink laws of physics  to get away with it.  The reason for this fascination with exceeding  c ? Maybe he wants to go back in time and take back those statements praising Bush, Powell, and Reagan. Or maybe he wants to go to Arcturus 3 and tell them that they lied about the anal probe not hurting.  (Catty, Jon.) (The network's been slower than a constipated slug all day. You'd be catty too.)

       Temporary outbreak of chivalry.   I hate to see a lady in distress so I'm going to give you some links that will, hopefully, help out the damsel in distress,  urlLink e-claire :  First, I'll link to  urlLink this worthy , who has set e-claire the herculean task of getting 12 non-council bloggers to link to his site and these two sites:   urlLink Spiced Sass   and   urlLink Dean's World   both of which are fine blogs that merit reading.  So now e-claire has another pelt to nail to the wall. (Ooooh, questionable metaphor. Not that it's stopping me.)  Hope this helps.

       So what the hell is a neoconservative?   The label "neoconservative" is being tossed around quite a lot recently, usually by people who make no attempt to define what it means. My suspicion is that the vast majority of the people using this word perjoratively have no idea what a neoconservative is and don't really care to learn.   Those who are genuinely curious, on the other hand, would be well served by reading  urlLink this article from Joshua Muravchik  on the AEI (American Enterprise Institute) website. One handy insight from the article: No, neocons aren't rightist Trotskyites. Bet you were wondering too.  (And for a lighter touch on the matter of what a neocon is, check out  urlLink this ,  urlLink this , and  urlLink this  -- NRO-nik Jonah Goldberg's three-part overview of neoconservatism and its discontents.)

       Hitchens and Said   Interestingly, Christopher Hitchens and Edward Said maintained a friendship for years. Here are links to articles by Hitchens that offer a much more nuanced portrait of Said than the one I wrote on 9/25/03.  From  The Atlantic :  urlLink Where the Twain Should Have Met . Hitchens displays a sympathy for Said tempered by a disappointment that he failed to live up to his beliefs.  In  The Nation  Hitchens defended Said against accusations by Justus Reid Weiner (update to my 9/25/03 entry) that Said  urlLink  had falsified parts of his autobiography .  And in Slate Hitchens offers his  urlLink affectionate obituary  for Said, a man he admired for 25 years.  Hitchens and Said also worked together on a book:  urlLink  Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question  .

       Edward Said, R.I.P.   Martin Kramer wrote a short introduction to Said and his theories at his excellent blog  urlLink Sandstorm  (click on "Said's Splash"). According to Kramer, Edward Said was trained in English and comparative literature but became, by writing  Orientalism , the intellectual source of the critical theory of post-colonialism. Kramer has spent a goodly amount of time pointing out the deeply pernicious effects of  Orientalism  and its spawn, the output of post-colonial theorists throughout the world.   From what I can tell Said deserves our condemnation. He has abetted the politicization of Middle East studies, which has reached a stage wherein it is incapable of describing the truth of the Middle East, much less prescribing useful solutions to that region's woes. In the end, Said and the theoretical cadres surrounding his theories can fairly be charged with promoting a dangerous ignorance that has cost lives, Western and Arab.   Said died at age 67 after a   urlLink long struggle with leukemia .   UPDATE:  Edited the above to correct the use of  post-colonialist  where  post-colonial  was appropriate. Adding a link to  urlLink a story in Salon  describing Justus Reid Weiner's attack on Said's autobiography,  Out of Place: A Memoir . See entry above for Christopher Hitchens's take on Said.

       Recalling the recall of the recall.    urlLink Now it's on again.   Prediction: Davis recalled by a thin margin, Bustamante elected by a similarly slight amount. Ahnold has already blown it and McClintock doesn't have enough time (or money) to get his message out. The basis for my prediction? Wild-assed guess.

       Notes about visiting the Philadelphia Museum of Art.     Parking there is atrocious to the point of being self-limiting for museum attendance. Don't they  want  people to come there?    Looking at 400-year-old suits of armor is the best way of confirming to yourself that yes, in fact, our lives and health really have improved over the years, as witness the fact that I would be able to look down onto the top of almost every suit of armor on display.    A man and a woman were sitting across a small table from each other in the cafeteria. I went about eating my lunch until I glanced over and saw the woman pressing her palm flat against the man's bowed head. Did I just witness a religious conversion, or something more mundane? How exciting if the man had a spiritual experience right there in the museum cafeteria!   More as I think of it.

       Global warming, cool blogs, and you.   From  urlLink this cool blog  (via  urlLink this cool blog ) comes the following story about one possible cause of global temperature variation:    Global cooling?   Researchers in Russia argue that the variations in global temperature can be explained by reference to changes in solar activity. One fact they point to is falling temperatures between 1950 and 1970 which sparked discussion of a new ice age. What has happened since has been an increase in solar output.  If they are correct, then a period of declining global temperatures should be getting under way about now - which they illustrate by average annual air temperatures in Irkutsk falling over the past three years.  Not sure if I'm convinced, but I've always been rather sceptical about the global warming thesis, so it is certainly an idea that deserves to be noted for future reference.   urlLink Is the Global Warming Bubble about to Burst?

       No words.   I drew two towers within a pentagon on this day on my calendar. I put out the flag this morning. And I remembered that day. Brenda the temp came up to me while I was in the middle of something. I was busy and pre-occupied. She said, "An airplane has hit the World Trade Center." My mind couldn't change gears fast enough to handle that information; the best I could do was say "What?" But the look on her face told me -- it was the look I last saw on the face of the college kid who told me that the space shuttle Challenger had blown up, all those years before.   No words seem sufficient for the grief I feel, the grief I see in the faces of those whose hearts were broken that day just as mine was broken. Just remember the burning buildings; just remember those who jumped rather than burn; just remember the men and women who rushed toward the destruction to help when their instincts told them to run the other way. Remember.

       Home is where mom hangs the pictures...   ...and dad sets up the computers. Mom and dad have lived in five houses since I was born. They lived in at least that many before I was born. They were houses before we moved in, homes when mom put in the pictures and set up the furniture and put her stamp on them and dad set up his Dad Room, and then they were houses again when we moved out.   Back when I lived in the DC area I was able to drive by two of the houses we lived in when I was growing up. They aren't homes anymore, at least not for me.   I don't live in the house mom and dad live in now; it's mom and dad's home and I have my own home now, which used to be a house until my wife and I made it our own. Hopefully my stepsons think of it as home, like any other house their mom sets up.   It's all very middle class. I wouldn't have it any other way.

       Notes from the occasional traveler.    Nothing pretty was ever situated near the train tracks. Oh, and getting from the suburbs to a major airport is  much  easier in DC than in Philly.    This is the first time since 9/11 that I've traveled by air. Just telling you this reminds me how boring and frugal I've become. It also tells me that maybe it took me until now to feel secure about flying.     Security was tighter than before 9/11 in that they checked the bags closer and made you show your ID more often, but not as bad -- I am told -- as it was in the year right after 9/11, so things have clearly relaxed. But considering how easy it's been to get prohibited items through the new security arrangements, maybe they've relaxed too much.    The experience of going through an airport always reminds me of how woefully unstylish I am. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I was dressed like the caricature of a dweeby guy. Sigh.     I'd forgotten what a liberating experience it was to travel by air on a weekday. I don't do it enough that it's routine, I have the luxury of taking my time so it's not a pain in the ass, and I've done it before so it's not overwhelming for me. It's like playing legal hooky -- everybody at work is toiling away and I've gone flying. Wahoo! (Yes, I have no life. You need me to tell you that?)    You're going to make me say it, aren't you? Fine. Fine. I'll just say it then: Britney Spears has a great ass. There. Are you PLEASED with having humiliated me? Eh? (Yes, I just stopped at a news stand in the airport and picked up this month's issue of  Esquire . Oh, and the rest of her is pretty good too. I guess.)    I need to do this more often.

       I'm not crazy, I'm just changing antidepressants.   Yesterday was spent babysitting a sick 9-year-old so not much blogging was possible. Yesterday's news was so depressing anyway that I just couldn't summon the energy to be outraged about it. I'll have comments on the car bombings in Baghdad eventually, if only in passing, but right now it's 5: frickin' 57 AM and the only reason I'm up at this hour is that the antidepressants they had me on before cause liver damage and so my new psychopharmacologist decided to wean me off of them. Which involves sleeplessness and listless, pointless blog entries. Maybe later I'll be relevant.

       Nothing profound.   I should be making pithy, relevant comments on the news of the day but I'm not up to it mentally. But my day wasn't a total bust. I saw tiny, eentsy-weensy snowflakes this morning -- pretty remarkable for southeast PA. It was nothing significant and might even have been sleet but I chose to think of it as snow. It made me happy the way snow always does. It's a calming influence on the universe; it muffles the noises of civilization, it slows down the world, it softens the blows. That's something I can use right now, when I'm feeling like I would love to get a log cabin in the woods (with a broadband connection, of course) and get away from everybody else.   That's a pretty unhealthy fantasy for a guy who already spends too much time by himself and inside his own head but I feel overwhelmed and exposed these days. Too much work, too much family, not enough privacy. My wife is so good about giving me my quiet time even though I think she resents it; sometimes, though, I long for the days when I could come home and not have to hold a conversation or make a decision or do something that needs doing. But then those days were so goddamn lonely. So I have a choice: Stay sane and lose some privacy or get my privacy and go mad from loneliness.   Dad said life is a set of compromises. Dad gets smarter every day I'm alive too.

       Rumsfeld asks the right questions.   Sometimes I'm not too sure about Donald Rumsfeld. His insistence that we should actually  reduce  our forces is counterintuitive; his feuding with some of his senior commanders is a distraction; and his confrontational attitude toward the media is pointless.    urlLink This leaked memo , however, gives me hope that he really does know what he is doing. Smart leaders ask these kinds of questions of their subordinates when it looks like they're slacking off or riding on previous successes. Leaders ask these questions to motivate thinking, reflection, and future planning, something the Pentagon must do frequently in the War Against Radical Islam (WARI) if it is to maintain its edge.   urlLink Bryan Preston  has noted that the Democrats, apparently, have tried to spin this memo as an admission of defeat on Rumsfeld's part; if so, it betrays their fundamental dishonesty about the WARI. Only the cynical could read this memo as anything more than a helpful tool to stimulate brainstorming.  (Link via  urlLink InstaPundit .)

       Wretchard: "Islam and the End of the Left"   First, read  urlLink this post from Belmont Club . NOW.   I discovered  urlLink Belmont Club  by clicking a link in the comments at Rantburg -- as I've said before, Rantburg's commenters are a golden source of information and links -- and already I'm excited by it, because Wretchard is grappling with key strategic questions in what I've chosen to call The War against Radical Islam (WARI). Although the initialism is pretty unforturnate.  Anyway, the link above is a good overview of a trend we will see more and more of as the WARI proceeds: Increasing cooperation between the anti-American left with radical Islam, to the point where they begin to meld into one movement. Those leftists who cannot bring themselves to embrace a religious doctrine will nonetheless listen to those leftists who have converted to Islam so long as the converts sing the siren song of anti-Americanism. Lenin preached that any action that destroys the enemies of socialism is by definition a laudable action. Muhammad said the same thing on Islam's behalf. They're made for each other.

       Solid analysis of the situation in Iraq.   From  urlLink Rantburg  comes the  urlLink most clear-headed analysis  of the situation in Iraq that I've seen thus far. This analysis says that Syria is next on the hit parade, that U.S. planners have adapted to the guerrilla war by accepting it as the price of doing business, and Iran comes after Syria. It doesn't have nice things to say about Rumsfeld, but then he seems to have been paralyzed in the post-war environment. Which might be why Bush is handing the Iraq portfolio over to Condi Rice.   Check out the comments too -- Rantburg's commenters always seem to be saavy and informed.

        urlLink CNN: "College student admits planting box cutters on planes"     WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A 20-year-old North Carolina student has admitted placing box cutters and other suspicious materials aboard two Southwest Airlines planes, law enforcement sources told CNN Friday....The sources said the individual -- described as a male student of Guilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina -- was a passenger aboard the planes, and not an employee of the airline or airports. They said the individual is cooperating with officials, and they stressed he has not been arrested or detained.   This story has some implications other than the obvious one that the TSA is still struggling with its security procedures (and that the airlines still aren't taking security seriously). Later in the story the student describes his actions as an act of civil disobedience designed to test TSA's security, much as an ethical hacker will test the security of a company's network and, if he hacks it successfully, leave a note detailing what he did and how to fix it. Still, will others who successfully crack airline security with less benign intentions be able to claim that their's was an act of civil disobedience just like the student's? And what have terrorist organizations learned from this incident?  I'm not condemning the student's actions, but I am worried about the implications of the civil disobedience defense for future incidents.

       The lure of blood.   Rereading my entry of Tuesday, October 14, it occurs to me how strong ties of kinship are compared to intellectual ties like nationality. When modern humans emerged from Africa they probably destroyed all competitors, because they cared only for their families and their kin. You see the strength of these ties still today, in places where family and clan are the basic social unit and nationhood is an artificial Western concept.   Our civilization, which is much to be preferred to the state of nature, requires a constant input of intellectual and moral energy to sustain itself. People who speak casually of destroying or radically altering what we've built need to be reminded that, in a world where the clan rules, there is no room for dissent, aberration, eccentricity, and individualism. Many of those who loathe our civilization would be casually eradicated in the state of nature because they would have no role in the world of the clan. These thoughtless nihilists need to be reminded that everything they hate -- order, stability, the rule of law -- is necessary for a society that can tolerate them.

       Quality of light.   Today is a windy day after last night's rain. On my drive to work I pass a large, open field on my right-hand side. At that moment, as I passed the field, the sun broke out from behind a cloud and suddenly it was as if a perpetual fog had been cleared from the air.

       Yes, we all came from Africa.   Some anthropologists have theorized that modern humans --  Homo sapiens sapiens  -- evolved separately in different regions. Another set of anthropologists argued that all modern humans originated in Africa and spread out across the world from there.  Based on some rigorous genetic testing, the  urlLink out of Africa  theorists seem to have the upper hand. The findings noted in this article imply that modern humans migrating from Africa encountered earlier species of humans -- for example, Neanderthals in Europe -- and  urlLink probably destroyed   them. So imagine being a Neanderthal and seeing everything you hold dear taken away by these smarter, tougher strangers who look like you but are alien in many ways.

       Unbiased news from CNN.  Riiiiight.    In a story titled  urlLink "Bush approval rating moves back up,"  CNN Political Unit reporter Keating Holland has a certain task to perform: Talk about a poll and its implications. Polls are subject to interpretation, and most people don't have the time or the statistical knowledge to do it themselves, so journalists should indeed read between the lines as far as possible consistent with characterizing the numbers accurately. Keating does that in a reasonably straightforward way, or at least he does right up to this point:  Today, 44 percent say the economy is in good shape -- up seven points since March -- and nearly two-thirds say that the economy will be in good shape a year from now.  Americans, however, are in an angry mood -- much angrier the past few years -- and who knows who they may take it out on?   (My emphasis.) Uh, okay Keating, are you going to cite the Federal Anger Index to back up this assertion? Have you checked Gallup's National Pissed-Off Citizen Database? Is it possible that the fact that people were enraged in California might not mean that people are seething in Kansas? Here's a thought -- maybe you're just trying to spin some good news for Bush so it doesn't look so good?   (Begin sarcasm.) Naw, can't be that. After all, it's CNN! (End sarcasm.)

       The Problem with Joe.   What the hell is it with Joe Biden that makes him so fucking annoying? Or, more to the point, what is it with Biden that sends me into a fury everytime he opens his mouth?   Some of it is his manner. He says something, perhaps something perfectly innocuous, but then he grins that shiteating grin of his that says, "Damn, am I clever or what?" and you just want to reach into the television and slap him around. Then there's that false seriousness; when he delivers one of his lectures about how very, very awful the president is to have done something he has the proper expression and posture, but his voice says "I'm so disingenuous that I don't believe a word I'm saying but I'm going to talk anyway just to make you angry at me."   Now, for all I know Biden really is sincere, really does believe what he says, really isn't the complete scumbag that he comes across to me as. Maybe. But you know, I just can't buy it. And I just can't give you a good, defensible reason why. And that's what annoys me the most. Dammit.

       The Nobel Peace Prize Committee Gets Serious Again   The Nobel prize for peace has gone to Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate  urlLink Shirin Ebadi . This choice of recipients marks a welcome return to the spirit of the prize, which was tarnished last year by the committee's decision to award it to Jimmy Carter as a direct slap at George W. Bush for failing to listen to his betters. This year's prize winner is actually deserving -- an excellent change of pace from the people who once saw fit to give the prize to the likes of Yasser Arafat.  UPDATE: October 12, 2003. I should have known better. As Charles Johnson at  urlLink Little Green Footballs  notes, the Nobel committee is  urlLink nothing if not consistent  -- that is, consistently execrable.

        LA Times  + Gray Davis = slime-o-ramaramarama.   At first, on Tim Russert's show on Sunday the 5th, the guy from the  LA Times  reassured us -- with a bit of a smirk -- that they had nothing to do with the Davis campaign and all of the women accusing Ahnold of sexual harrassment had been discovered through their own investigations. Now  urlLink Bill Bradley  at the  LA Weekly  tells us that Davis campaign personnel not only knew of the  LA Times'  revelations before they were published, but people close to Davis urged at least one woman to contact the  LA Times'  reporters on this story.  Let's hope that the smugness has faded away a little.

       A little recall some of the time!   I haven't commented on the California recall much, mostly because it's not my state. Still, California is such a whale of a state -- in size, population, and economic impact -- that what happens there can't be ignored. So let me get some things off my chest:   In my not so humble opinion, any group of citizens that would re-elect Gray Davis deserves to have him for the full, unspeakably dull, majestically disastrous 4 years of his second term.    Bustamante is a dull apparatchik at best, a closet racist at worst.    Ahnold is certainly a serial sexual harasser, probably a long-time steroid abuser, and possibly a pathological control freak.    McClintock is a man of principle who has interesting ideas and plenty of experience in government. He is also a movement conservative in a liberal state, and thus unelectable.   So, having called down a pox on all houses, who do I support for governor? Part of me says nobody -- let the chips fall where they may. That's a dodge, though. So who?   Believe it or not, if Cruz Bustamante were to suddenly become a fiscal conservative he would have the best chance of turning things around because he would have a greater rapport with the Democratic-controlled state house than anybody else. On the other hand, the chances of this are nearly nil. So No to Cruz.  See above for my opinion of McClintock. As a Republican I weep that he can't do better.   Ahnold, despite his personal failings, can still surround himself with some competent advisors and do some good work so long as he lets the smart people do their thing. That'll be hard for a man of his gargantuan ego, but possible. Since I'm a Republican, I'm stuck with Ahnold, to my regret.  So there you have it -- let the mediocrity commence!

       Under the covers.   I finally got a decent night's sleep last night, probably because I'm  changing my antidepressants (long story). There are times when I wish I could stay in bed all day and night. When the world is hateful, when the weather is bleak, when my dreams seems like they're dead, when things I had cherished fade away, I just want to find a dark, warm quiet place and stay there forever. Forever and ever, and nothing will ever bother me again. Is this feeling one of the reasons why people seek solace in God? Read this excerpt from Psalm 16 (King James Version):    10  For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see  corruption.  11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life; in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.  But hiding is too much like dying, and I'm not ready for that. Still too much to do. And there's still my warm bed.

       A deadly hand of poker.   Bush is on the run now. The economy is not growing at a satisfactory rate and joblessness is still a problem. He is dogged by the Plame/Wilson scandal. Most damagingly, soldiers keep dying in Iraq with no sign of an end to it in sight. Polls show that he would lose to the most popular Democratic presidential candidates if the election were held today.  Despite what the smarmier liberal pundits say, Bush is not an idiot; what's more he is blessed with an impressive stable of advisors. These advisors can see that the situation in Iraq, coupled with the sluggish economy, could make Bush a one-term president like his father. These advisors, if they're worth their salt, are probably telling Dubya to back off from the Iraqi front of the War on Terror:  "Maybe find a way to pull back, Mr. President. Maybe we let the UN pick up the ball, Mr. President." Maybe that's good advice, maybe it isn't. Either way, Bush isn't going to take it, and Victor Davis Hanson  urlLink understands why :   Second, President Bush, whatever one thinks of him, is, well, let's face it, a strange sort of president. For all the hysteria about Karl Rove's supposed political calculations and machinations, I sense that the president doesn't care much what others think of him; indeed, for the price of winning this war he might even be willing to be a one-term president....  ...For some reason or another he does not seem to crave future rave reviews from the New York Times, a late-night private dinner in Georgetown, or an obsequious phone call from a European apparatchik. Indeed, he seems to have expected the invective from the Europeans, the slander from our own media, and even the irrational, if not visceral, hatred of American elites as the inevitable wages that come with at last saying "enough is enough" and thereby dissolving in a moment the comfortable fraud that so many of us had invested so heavily in the last 20 years. How long his resistance will last in the face of slander and slurs of historic proportions is unclear; but for now he has again responded in a manner that his enemies would never have anticipated.   That is Bush's strength; the strength of being immune to the carping of the short-sighted. This is his ace-in-the-hole in the poker he is playing with the jihadis, the Democrats, and the media: He knows he is right and they are wrong.

       The 10 dwarves will soon be down to 9.    urlLink Fox News  is reporting that Senator Bob Graham of Florida  urlLink will soon drop out of the race for the Democratic nomination to run against Bush .  This move is unsurprising. Graham's campaign fundraising was lackluster from the start and  urlLink rumors had been getting out  that he would pack it in soon.   So who next? Maybe Braun or Kucinich or Sharpton, each of whom is a marginal candidate in the first place. Edwards has had a surprisingly hard time raising money and he might not last beyond Iowa if he places at the bottom of the pack. So here's my semi-wild-ass guess: Graham will be out in a week or so. Kucinich, Braun, and Sharpton will be out by December. That leaves 6. Edwards won't survive Iowa. That leaves 5 -- Clark, Dean, Gephardt, Kerry, and Lieberman -- to fight it out down the line. Beyond the point where 5 are left standing I'm left clueless. So keep tuned for more political reporting of the same high caliber! Hello? Is anybody there...?

       Sometimes God works in completely straightforward ways.   Once upon a time there was a couple who had sex in a cathedral in NYC as a stunt for a radio talk show.  Alas, the couple was caught in the act and they were hit with some misdemeanor charges and a good deal of embarassment. The charges weren't serious, though, and the couple were going to get off with a slap on the wrist.  But God, the Big Kahuna, Y*W*H, Allah, the First Principle, He/She/It had different plans, and so  urlLink this little bit of cosmic retribution  occurred.   So the lesson is: If you must doink in public, at least try to do it in a place that won't insult a supreme being. But you'd think that would just be common sense.  (So Jon, give me all your thoughts on God.) (I think I may or may not believe in God depending on what the weather is.) (Safe to say that you're an agnostic?) (And an ambivalent one at that.)

       You know the feeling...   ...when your eyes just won't focus on anything significant.  When you can't make yourself care about world events. When you can't believe that anybody cares about your hobbies. When your home life is so dull that it's embarrassing.  When you really need to buckle down at work but somehow you just can't make yourself give a damn.  When there are useful things you should be doing around the house but you can't work up the energy. You know that feeling, right? Because if you don't know that feeling that means I have to come up with something interesting to say and I can't. There's nothing. Blank slate.  Tabula rasa .  The big writerus blockus. Sigh. Maybe I'll take up knitting. They say it's quite time-consuming.

       Update.   I'm back from Florida but busy at work and feeling the effects of settling into a combination of Effexor and Welbutrin. The effects being that I don't sleep much or well. Back to the psychopharmacologist for some sleeping potion, I guess (cue image of witch hunched over bubbling cauldron and cackling "Here's a potion for you, dearie, nyahaha!"). As you can see, sleeplessness and pharmaceuticals don't mix with blogging. Hmm...Something about the trip...  Oh yeah. One of the screws in the frames of my glasses comes loose all the time so I carry around a set of precision screwdrivers in my go-anywhere-Land's-End-knockoff-soft-sided briefcase. In Philadelphia International Airport they looked at them and shrugged and I carried them through security. Five days later I tried the same thing at Orlando International Airport and the TSA people objected. What was the difference? How is the traveler supposed to know? Was I stupid to forget about the screwdrivers? If so, why didn't they yank them in Philly? WTF?   The quality of editing for hardback book club novels is egregious, the optometrist dilated my eyes and now the white background in the Blogger editor window hurts my eyes, it's raining too much in the Mid-Atlantic states, and one of these days I'm going to discuss the entry of Sunday, November 2, 2003 but not right now. And boy could I use a drink. Somebody send me a virtual vodka tonic, okay?

       Dark week.   Our soldiers are dying in Iraq, more and more each day, until 16 were killed at once today. Days like this make you wonder whether it was all a horrible mistake to invade this country. We will lose many more soldiers before we are finally gone, one way or another. More and more it seems that there was never a really good reason to invade, never a sufficient reason to justify the sacrifices in blood. Weeks like this make me want to listen to my Dad, who remembers being told that the war in Vietnam was necessary and believing it, only to come to the conclusion that it was all lies.   Now is when it seems like we should just let them kill each other. Do they want to go back to the middle ages? Go then, and enjoy it, and we'll just stay on our own continent and buy your oil and mind our own business. We can still run with dignity too; let the Europeans and the UN take over, phase out our troops as quickly as possible, and declare victory. There, we did what we said we would do, now we'll concentrate on Afghanistan and making airport security work. Yes, maybe Iraq will slide back into Baathism but we'll never pacify the Saddam's Sunni base. Why should we try? Nor will the Shiia thank us for saving them -- shit, none of them will thank us. Iraq isn't worth a single infantryman or a solitary Marine. Is it? Especially in weeks like this?

       Christmas greetings.      8...And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.      9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.      10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.      11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.      12 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.      13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavely host praising God, and saying,      14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

       Pretty much as expected.   President Bush's poll numbers get a  urlLink solid boost  from the capture of Saddam Hussein. It's far, far too early for the Republicans to claim that Bush is a shoo-in for re-election, but getting Saddam does take a potentially harmful issue for Bush off the agenda. Of course if US forces got, say, Osama bin Laden by August Bush would be hard to beat (assuming the economy keeps growing).

       Gee thanks old buddy, Part I.   The guys at  urlLink Power Line    urlLink have noted  that Al Gore did not contact his old running mate Joe Lieberman before endorsing Howard Dean. It's a typically Goresque (Gorian? Gorey?) move -- expediency first and screw the losers who get hurt.    But there's more to Gore's endorsement than just a reflexive need to back a perceived winner.  urlLink Joe Scarborough   had a guest -- I forget his name and the transcript isn't up yet -- who was described as a friend of Gore's and tried to get the guy to admit that there was a war on between the Clintonians, whose man is Wes Clark, and the left wing of the party, represented by Howard Dean and, increasingly, Al Gore. This Friend of Al went out of his way to present a united Democratic party that's ready to kick some Republican butt, of course, but Scarborough is probably right that the centrists in the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) are trying to work through Lieberman to hold off insurgents from the party's left wing, which has become energized by opposition to the Iraq war and straightforward Bush hatred. Al Gore used to be a DLC stalwart but the 2000 election pushed him to the left, no doubt with revenge on his mind. Now Al has kicked the DLC's man, Lieberman, in the balls, a blow that Lieberman will probably not recover from.  So consider: Kucinich, Sharpton, and Moseley Braun are side shows -- circus tents waiting to be folded up in the dead of night (the circus metaphor comes naturally when discussing these three). They can be removed from the equation, assuming they don't start third-party efforts (Sharpton just might simply out of cussedness, but let's assume that away for now). That leaves six candidates.   Gore has gut-shot Lieberman, whose campaign is now just waiting to die. That's five. Edwards is a nonentity and looks like a college freshman anyway; his campaign will be dead within moments of the end of the South Carolina primary unless he does surprisingly well. That's four. Gephardt has lost  urlLink two key union endorsements  to Dean and unions were all he had going for him.    That leaves three: Kerry, Clark, and Dean. I'll deal with them in the next entry.

       Blue Monday (A Little Cheese with that Whine?).   I just took the test at  urlLink AdultADD.com . Turns out I've got -- wait for it -- adult ADD. I had most of the symptoms: Difficulty concentrating, inability to organize, procrastination, bad memory for appointments and obligations. This is the second screening test that came up with that result. The psychopharmacologist that's prescribing my depression meds said that Welbutrin should do the trick. I didn't point out to her, but should have, that I've been taking Welbutrin for years now and it hasn't made a dent in the ADD symptoms.   All this contemplating my weaknesses made me stare into space for a while, think about worst-case scenarios, miss my wife (who's working a double shift in order to make some extra money for Christmas) and really, really wish for a drink. I've been having a lot of that lately. I've been on the wagon for 7-1/2 years now and I'm proud of that, but if somebody handed me a drink right now I'd toss all those years of sobriety out the window and suck it right down just to get that feeling you get when you have the first drink. Everybody knows that feeling; it's like breathing clean air after walking through smog -- like falling back onto a featherbed after an exhausting day. It's relief in a glass. I miss that so very, very much these days, when I feel like there's nothing to my life, like I'm stuck in mud and I haven't accomplished a damn thing. When I was drunk I could put the fear and the envy and the sense of not belonging to the human race aside for a night. I could feel free and go bed and sleep deeply and not wake up in the morning stillness and wonder why the hell I was alive.   That's the way down to where I was before, down to the place where I was less than human, more like an animal who cared only to eat, sleep, and get drunk. I'm not going there again -- I know what it's like now and I'm not sure I could survive it again. But some days I wish I could forget the animal times and just get that one sip, that taste of release. Just once, you know, and never again.  You know, just like before.

       So why is it that I use Blogger again?   Oh yeah, the free bit. Of course the site was down until at least 3:00 EST. Wasn't Google supposed to bring some professionalism to this outfit? I'm going to get a PayPal account, put a link up on the left-hand side, and beg for money to get a  urlLink Typepad  account. If you can help I would appreciate it. I think the change would do us both good.

       It was a dark and stormy orgy.    urlLink This was in the Guardian .   This is from me:  Her breasts were like ballistic missiles of lust. My heaving member reached boost phase in sympathy with the weaponization of her missile silo of desire and, as my penetrating rod entered her bunker of joy she cried out "Oh God, it's a leadership strike! Yes!"  Think you can do better (or worse, depending on your perspective)? Bring it on, bad writers!  (Thanks go out to  urlLink Tim Blair , of course.)

       urlLink  Report: Bush Wants Mission to the Moon    According to this FoxNews report, Bush could announce a major new space initiative on December 17 (the anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk), including manned travel to, and permanent bases on, the moon.   urlLink Others  have speculated that Bush's announcement could also call for a manned mission to Mars.  I would love for this to be true; the NASA of the space shuttle monopoly has been a bureaucratic nightmare of complacency and sometimes lethal incompetence (with the exception of some of the exploratory programs). But another President Bush promised us a big mission to Mars too, and that idea died of strangulation in the budgetary process. Can Bush the Younger pull off what Bush the Elder could not? Maybe -- but only if he gets a second term in which to shepherd these programs along.  It would be wonderful to go back to the Moon for good and then on to Mars, but I won't celebrate until the landers touch down.

       Healing Iraq, one child at a time.    urlLink This story on FoxNews about Chief Wiggles  (aka Chief Warrant Officer Paul Holton) should give his worthy project,  urlLink Operation Give , the boost it deserves. Chief Wiggles says his goal is  "...connecting with the Iraqi people so that we build a relationship, build trust. A big part of that is reaching out to them, and a lot of times that is through their families, through the children. That way, we're able to build a connection and change attitudes about America."  It's a gesture of peace in a nation wracked by war and oppression, so get thee to  urlLink Operation Give  and get something for a child in Iraq. You don't have to support the war to send love to a child.

       Kafka and the New Hampshire primary results: It's not a band.   According to  urlLink this roundup  of the NH primary results, Joe Lieberman only got 9% of the vote. Thus I pronounce Lieberman to be toast. As you might not know, Franz Kafka was going to have the main character in his novel  The Metamophosis  turn into a slice of toast but when he looked down and saw a cockroach eating toast crumbs he changed his mind. Thus the title of this entry. As you can see, constant bouts of snow, freezing rain, and near-arctic temperatures have driven me to the brink of madness, so you're going to have to bear with me while I write things like this. Thank you.

       A public service announcement.   So you've come to this blog thinking, "Way cool! Jonathan Elliott has a blog! Wait, hold it, here's this middle-aged right-wing crazoid babbling about al Qaeda in Iraq -- as  if  --  so where's Jonathan Elliott the composer ? WTF?"  Just so you know, I'm not him and he's not me.  urlLink Jonathan Elliott the composer  is an artist, a man of talent and ability. Jonathan Elliott the proprietor of Workaround Blog -- "So what's  that  supposed to mean?" -- patience, I'm getting there -- is just this guy with two stepsons, a wife, two cats, a mortgage, and little noticeable musical talent. (For evidence, ask my loved ones about my rendition of "O Little Town of Bethlehem." I took the grout off the tub by singing a couple verses of that.)   Oh, and the name of the blog? I've been through several blogs so far, none of which pleased me. This blog is just an interim measure until I figure out what I want to say. A workaround, as the computer types say. And no, I can't help you with your paper for Music Appreciation 107, so sorry.

       "This Can't Be True."   The guys at  urlLink Powerline  -- they'll go in the list 'o links soon -- note that the 101st Airborne  urlLink has captured members of al Qaeda and Ansar al Islam in northern Iraq . But according to the opponents of the Iraq War, Saddam the secularist would have no truck with Sunni radicals like al Qaeda and Ansar. But they had a mutual enemy and Saddam was, if nothing else, desperate for allies against the U.S. Saddam wasn't an ideologue; he believed in power for himself and his clan, and if he had to ally with Shaitan himself to survive he would have welcomed him with a kiss on both cheeks.  (Alas, the Powerline entry doesn't give a source for the story. I'd like to see that just for my comfort level.)

       Remember the RINOs.    urlLink John Warner (R. VA) changes his mind about the assault weapons ban , and not for the better (scroll down for the paragraph about Warner's change of heart). Warner has been in the Senate for a long time, and even though the state he represents is just over the border from DC it would seem that he can still get isolated from his constituents. The people of the Commonwealth of Virginia might want to make their feelings known about this unfortunate flip-flop on the senator's part. (A renewal of the ban is being offered as an amendment to a bill to shield gun manufacturers from harassing suits.)

       Not a bad book to be.   According to  urlLink these guys , I'm this:        You're  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe !   by C.S.

Now it seems like winter will never end and you feel cursed. Soon there will be an epic struggle between two forces in your life and you are very concerned about a betrayal that could turn the balance. If this makes it sound like you're re-enacting Christian theological events, that may or may not be coincidence. When in doubt, put your trust in zoo animals.

       AP: Dean will bail out today.   According to this  urlLink AP breaking news report , Howard Dean will withdraw from the race for the Democratic Party nomination for president in a news conference this afternoon. The report said that Dean would work to form organizations to promote the principles he advocates.  And then there were four. Questions: Will Dean go Green? Who will he endorse? How much longer can Kucinich and Sharpton last? Is John Edwards running for Vice President or does he think he has a shot at a wide-open convention vote?  Kerry isn't over the top yet and more Democrats might decide that a southern moderate is far more electable than a scandal-prone northern liberal. If Edwards does pull the nomination off, Bush is in trouble in the South -- unless he can pound Edwards as a SINO (southerner in name only). We shall see.

       The General Steps Out   Out of the race, that is. According to  urlLink this story  on  urlLink CNN , Clark will announce his withdrawal today at 2:00 in Little Rock. Thus the Clintons' stalking horse goes to the political stable in the sky, or whatever. (There's going to be a serious metaphor drought before this campaign season is over.)  With Clark's withdrawal from the race, that leaves five: The Also-Rans (Sharpton, Kucinich), the Contenders (Edwards, Kerry), and the Spoiler (Dean). The Also-Rans can't last much longer -- I expect Kucinich to be the next one to go, followed by Sharpton, assuming the Democratic Party leadership cuts him some kind of deal (was Sharpton's run ever anything but a shakedown?). Sharpton could make trouble if he doesn't get a deal he likes but he'll go away once he's satisfied.  The Contenders will be the establishment story: Will Kerry win everything from here on out? Can Edwards still end up with a delegate count that will keep him within striking distance of Kerry? Who will Clark endorse?      A more important question, however, is who will  Dean  endorse? Dean, the Spoiler, is going to be the real story for awhile. He might do the Good Dean thing and endorse one or the other of Kerry and Edwards after withdrawing. Or, he might do the Angry Dean thing, tell the party establishment to piss up a rope, endorse nobody, and  urlLink run as the Greens' candidate . Now THAT would be a story -- and Dean would become to whoever the Democratic nominee is as Ross Perot was to Bush the Elder. Democrats and Republicans alike will keep their fingers crossed about which Dean finally puts on an appearance. We live in interesting times...

       Should I buy a gun?   For some reason I don't understand I've started thinking about buying a gun. Maybe I'm having a midlife crisis, maybe I've been influenced by 9/11, maybe I'm turning into a crazed right-wing wacko. Whatever the answer, I've suddenly gotten this idea that now is the time to get a gun and I can't get the thought out of my head. On the other hand there's a part of my brain that says this is a stupid idea, I've gone round the bend, and I shouldn't even consider such a whacked-out idea. In the words of the King of Siam in  The King and I , it is a puzzlement.  Dad told me once that when you're of two minds about something you should take a piece of paper, draw a line down the center, and list the pros on one side and the cons on the other. In that spirit I present the following lists:   Reasons to Own a Handgun   1. Home defense 2. Concealed carry for personal defense 3. Take up target shooting 4. Exercise 2nd Amendment rights 5. Always wanted to learn how to handle a firearm 6. Shooting is a sport I can share with my stepson (since he's young and lithe and I'm old and fat) 7. Need more fun in my life 8. Get me out of the house more often 9. Improve hand-eye coordination 10. It's got to be cheaper than messing around with computers   Reasons for Not Owning a Handgun   1. Possibility of accidental discharge 2. Possibility of shooting a loved one by mistake 3. Young stepson could injure or kill himself with it if he isn't trained 4. From what I can tell it can be a pretty expensive hobby 5. Has a high learning curve 6. Might require more manual dexterity than I've got 7. Might get bored with it 8. Time consuming 9. Neighborhood is pretty quiet -- do I really need a gun? 10. Wife might freak out  I've got to admit that 1, 2, 3, 9, and 10 are potential deal breakers. Given that these things are possibilities, however remote, can I really justify having a weapon that isn't really necessary? But then it's a dangerous world out there. But then...I don't know. Please comment if you've got an opinion, okay? Thanks.

      It's a rainy, cold early spring night here in southeast PA. A good cup of tea and a feeling of contentment after a workout put me in a contemplative mood on nights like this. The world around me is quiet; the only things I can hear are the patter of the rain, the whine of my computer, my wife at her computer in the other room, and my stepson getting ready for bed upstairs.   So what should I contemplate? How about those things for which I am grateful:   I am grateful that I and my loved ones are warm, dry, not hungry, not thirsty, and enjoy the fruits of modern technology and a bountiful land.    I am grateful for my parents, who raised themselves from a modest station through hard work and tenacity and did the best they could to raise good children.   I am grateful to the men who made possible a nation of laws wherein it is possible to pursue one's dreams relatively unmolested, resulting in historically unprecedented prosperity and freedom.  I am grateful to the men and women, past, present, and future, who have and do and will put their lives on the line to ensure that me and mine can live in peace and security.  And I must admit, I am grateful to God -- if he/she/it exists (just can't bring yourself to say it, can you Jon?) -- who has seen fit to bless me and mine with the best things in life.   Good night, dear reader. Count your blessings and go with God.   (There, I said it: Go with God.)  (But do you  believe  it, truly  believe  that God exists?) (I don't know. I struggle against it, but something within me yearns for faith. I can't explain why.)

      First, read  urlLink this . (Link via  urlLink Tim Blair . The article is from 2002 but it's more relevant than ever.)  Then, read  urlLink this  (it's from the exquisite  urlLink Belmont Club , and was written upon learning of Spain's election of the Socialists and surrender to islamofascist terrorism -- the two events were as one).  The Left will always be attracted to the insurgent group, the group that is on the outside, because the image of the outsider stuggling against overwhelming odds is the chief romantic image of the Left. On the other hand, the left is also attracted to the power to forge radical societal change that control of the state offers, because the basis of leftist philosophy is the belief that all humans are perfectable, and only need to be nudged along the proper path to goodness by a firm but benevolent cadre of elites.   There is no contradiction here, though. The myth of legitimacy for the Left is that, as educated outsiders, they can see things that those caught up in false conciousness cannot. Having seen the flaws in the system they seek to destroy, they are therefore, the thinking goes, uniquely qualified to destroy the old order and apply their insight to the perfection of the ignorant. The revolutionary is the father of the savior; before Christ there must be John the Baptist.  This is what attracts the Left to islamofascism -- the Left sees in radical islam a reflection of their own beliefs about themselves. The terrorists are the revolutionary cadres engaging in revolutionary -- and therefore sanctified -- violence. The imams are the theoreticians: Marx, Lenin, Mao, and Castro in flowing robes (yet another romantic image!). The Koran is the book of the revolution, dispensing advice and theory just as  What is to be Done  and  Das Kapital  do. These images are irresistible to the Left and they will succumb to them, as Wretchard at Belmont Club has shown us.   Madrid was just a taste. Perhaps the Brigada Rossa of Italy will make common cause with al Qaeda to punish Rome; maybe the intellectual successors to the Baader-Meinhoff Gang will unite with al Qaeda to keep Berlin in its place; maybe the IRA is showing the jihadis the ropes in London.   Madrid was just a taste.  UPDATE: And perhaps the UK just foiled an attempt to give Britain its  urlLink taste of islamist terror .

       urlLink Spain's voters have decided to allow themselves to be cowed by terror  as they reject Aznar's Popular Party and hand a near majority to the opposition Socialists. The bombings in Madrid, which have taken nearly 200 lives and injured over a thousand, were depicted by Aznar's government as the work of the ETA, the Basque separatist terror group. However, more and more evidence shows that the bombings were al Qaeda's work, and the Socialists encouraged the belief that the bombings were retaliation for Spain's participation in operations in Iraq. This fear apparently swayed enough Spanish voters to throw the election, which it had been thought would be won by the Popular Party, to the Socialists.  Now, if the Socialists can form a government, we will see what they do. Will they run from Iraq? If so, Europe will never see the end of the bombs.  UPDATE: Wretcherd at  urlLink Belmont Club  gives us a peak at the dark heart of  urlLink the relationship between radical Islam and the international left . Perhaps soon Spain will know the exquisite, paralyzed pain of being consumed from within.

      The bill, to which Democrats and some Republicans succeeded in attaching a renewal of the assault weapons ban,  urlLink was killed at the urging of its Republican sponsor .

There was no indication of whether or not the bill shielding manufacturers from harassing lawsuits would come up again in this Congress.

       urlLink John Edwards will probably withdraw from the race for the Democratic nomination today , leaving John Kerry as the only viable Democrat in the race and essentially making him the Democratic party nominee. Now Kerry will focus on picking a VP candidate and attacking Bush.   No word on Kucinich and Sharpton. I've arrived at the conclusion that, since both of their campaigns are products of ideological fervor/ego gratification, one or both of them will run until the bitter end; however, their campaigns will be curious sideshows at best. The main event will begin when Kerry and Bush trot out their first big advertising campaigns.   Get set for a long, nasty campaign season, because this one will probably be close.  (Questions: Where's Howard Dean and who will he endorse? Will he run as an independent? Are Kerry's people wooing him with promises of a cabinet post in return for his endorsement? When will Bush really start hitting the road to campaign? Will Edwards be Kerry's VP choice (it would make sense, at least according to traditional wisdom)).

      Democrats and some Republican allies succeeded in attaching a reauthorization of the assault weapons ban to a bill shielding gun manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits. (Note the picture at the top of the article -- John Kerry, taking a break from his moratorium on attending votes in the Senate, is second from the left.) President Bush supports reauthorization of the ban but said he wanted the bill on lawsuits to be shorn of amendments, which gives him a loophole for vetoing the bill should it come to his desk with the assault weapons ban attached.   Gun owners, time to decide who your friends are. Given Bush's stance on the ban, it won't be easy.

      (Truth in advertising: I know squat about ballistics, I've never served in the military, and I don't even own a firearm. Bring your salt shaker to the following post.)  Not too many people in the US military like the 5.56 mm NATO round: it's just not much of a man-stopper, as troops in Afghanistan and Iraq have found, sometimes to their regret. Unfortunately, with an installed base of thousand of M16 assault rifles and M4 carbines using this round, there's plenty of inertial bureaucratic incentive to keep it around.   That's where  urlLink some guys from USSOCOM (US Special Operations Command)  came in. On their own initiative they campaigned to come up with a more powerful round with better ballistic characteristics. Interestingly, they got support in this pursuit from some knowledgeable people in the military (like the US Army Marksmanship Unit). After much testing it was concluded that a 6.8 mm round was optimal for stopping power and ballistic characteristics.  urlLink Then Remington got into the act   and started producing limited quantities of this 6.8 mm SPC round.  Great: But how to get it to the front-line troops? The problem is that large installed base of weapons chambered for the 5.56 mm NATO round (note that the 6.8 mm SPC round was specifically designed to fit existing M16/M4 magazines).  (What follows is speculation on my part.)   urlLink Enter Barrett Firearms, who produced an upper for the M16 that will chamber the new 6.8 mm SPC round.  Why create such a thing if there was no market for it? Maybe there will be a market for it -- maybe the plan is to retrofit the rifles carried by front-line troops with this new upper so they can use the new round.  That would be way cool, but there's another problem: The M16 is an old design. A guy named  urlLink Eugene Stoner  designed the M16 back in the mid-1950s and the state of the gunmaker's art has advanced since then.  Quite by coincidence, the US military was working on the prototypes of a weapon called the  urlLink OICW (Objective Individual Combat Weapon -- pentagonese at its worst) . It was an interesting idea: An assault rifle and a very smart grenade launcher all in one man-portable package. As the military tested it, however, they discovered that it really wasn't all that man-portable after all, and the program stalled. Meanwhile, word had percolated up from the troops that the M16/M4 just weren't good enough for modern combat. The military thrashed around looking for a replacement for Stoner's venerable design when somebody noticed that the assault rifle part of the OICW, made by the fine folks at the German firearms manufacturer  urlLink Heckler & Koch , was a really good rifle based on a really good design (the H&K G36). Somebody -- most likely H&K themselves -- came up with the idea of separating the assault rifle part of the OICW from the grenade launcher part and making it into an assault rifle replacement.  Thus was born the  urlLink XM8 . Now, according to the fine folks at  urlLink Picatinny Arsenal , the DoD unit responsible for getting armaments out to the soldiers, 5.56 mm NATO is the round for the US military: Discussions in forum on the Infantry Web site, www.infantry.army.mil, show some infantrymen question the value of fielding a new assault rifle delivering the same 5.56mm rounds already in service. They question the gain. Clarke, however, sees a lot of value added.  On the other hand, Heckler & Koch seem to emphasize something of interest to this discussion: A unique feature of the XM8 modular weapon system is the ability to easily and quickly reconfigure the weapon from one variant to the other to meet changing mission requirements,  to include caliber conversion . [Emphasis in original.] It's still a little bit mysterious, but then again the XM8 is supposed to be issued to the troops as early as mid-2006, so maybe the troops will finally get the round and the assault rifle that they need -- and deserve.

       urlLink Power Line  just got finished live-blogging Dr. Condoleeza Rice's testimony before the 9/11 commission. I have to make a deadline today (which is now approaching me like a possessed 18-wheeler with satan at the wheel) and I wasn't able to see it for myself. If what the Power Line guy says is true, she didn't do a great job. Not bad, but not good either, and she really needed to do well to blunt the impact of Richard Clarke's testimony. This isn't a victory for the Bushies, just a holding action. It's not going to help Bush's reelection chances.  The president's reelection chances are also being hurt by the uprisings in Iraq now and the Baathist remnants and the Shiites acting as Iran's cat's paw have figured that out. All they need to do is keep up a steady state of telegenic violence and they can defeat George Bush and bring in the man they know they can intimidate -- John Kerry. I fear for my country.

      The German word  urlLink  schwerpunkt   means something like "the main thrust" or "the center of mass." If I understand the history correctly, it was a term evolved by Clausewitz to describe the enemy's primary thrust in an offensive or source of strength from a strategic perspective. Key to this concept is the idea that  urlLink there can only be one  schwerpunkt  and every other aspect of the enemy's strength exists to support it .  So where is the  schwerpunkt  in Iraq? Is there one enemy warring against the Coalition or are there many? Is there a single center of mass for Coalition forces to strike at or is/are the enemy/enemies spread throughout the country and thus impossible to identify and destroy completely? Do the Shiites around  urlLink al Sadr  communicate with the Baathist remnants led by  urlLink al Douri ? (This is not at all impossible; the enemy of their enemy is their friend.)  I wish I knew the answer to these questions. I do know, however, that when historians finally have a chance to unravel this complicated period in the history of the Middle East they will find the Iranian theocrats at the bottom of much of the violence. Perhaps it is long past time to attend to the wasps nest rather than swat individual bugs.  UPDATE, 1406 EDT: al Sadr surrenders!(?) Maybe he had a look at the Marines cleaning out Fallujah and decided that the Coalition had finally gotten serious.  urlLink Wretchard nailed this one from the very beginning , of course. I'm more and more convinced that he's either an intelligence official or an analyst for Jane's. Or maybe he just has lots of time on his hands for research (the lucky bastard).

      More comments on this later, but...anybody who has read this blog knows that I supported the invasion of Iraq and still think it was the right thing to do. Still, it's hard to avoid comparing this photo to one taken during the Tet Offensive. It's more than a little disturbing to consider that Iran could take on the role of the Soviet Union as a supplier of the Shiite resistance. We must not make the same mistake here that we did in Vietnam, the mistake of thinking that we don't really have to destroy our enemies to succeed. To secure Iraq, the Iranian theocracy must be deposed and replaced with a regime friendly to the West. How that would be done is a subject for later.

      My aunt just emailed a picture from the reunion of my Dad's mom's side of the family.

It would have been easy for them to go off to work for Shuford Mills for 40 years, living, working, and retiring in the same town they grew up in. Instead they got educations, found their careers, and moved off to work, travel, raise families, and become their own men shaping their own destinies. This is why I admire my Dad so much; he never thought of himself as a victim, but rather as a man with potential who could build something through hard work. May we be fortunate enough to find more such men.

      It is well and good to apologize when you have committed an error; it shows humility and a willingness to adapt and change. The administration in general and President Bush in particular have been forthright that there was a breakdown of order and moral standing at the Abu Ghraib prison and that changes must be made. Moreover, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has gone before Congress and apologized in person for this incident.  However, there comes a point when the apologies have to stop and life has to go on. This isn't Bill Clinton lying under oath about playing hide the sausage with Monica Lewinsky -- this is war, and in war the very appearance of weakness is fatal. The only people profiting from this orgy of self-flagellation are the jihadis. Moreover, these calls from various Democratic senators -- the grotesque Joe Biden in particular -- for Rumsfeld to resign are the most disgusting displays of partisan opportunism we've seen since the Monicagate debacle. The fact is, Republicans were wrong to raise lying to the level of an impeachable offense because it weakened the presidency to a dangerous extent. The same goes now for the Democrats: They are wrong to call for Rumsfeld's resignation because  nothing about this scandal merits the kind of hysteria it is being accorded .   Nothing  .  The people, I think, see this for what it is, which is a regrettable but not crippling event. The table below (copied from this story on  urlLink ABCNews , it's fair use so pleasepleaseplease don't sue me) shows opinions about whether Rumsfeld should resign. Even among Democrats there is little sentiment for a resignation.      Government Accuntability            Donald Rumsfeld Should:     Resign His Job      Keep His Job             All      20 percent      69 percent         Democrats      30 percent      58 percent          Independents      17 percent       73 percent          Republicans      11 percent      82 percent               So: Let's put this one to bed, folks, and get on with the job of some true partisan backbiting. (Sigh. Gonna be a long spring, summer, and autumn.)  (Oh, a big non-award to the reader who can spot the amusing misspelling in ABC's table.

If you read the first few paragraphs of the story the only way you could divine Goldschmidt's party affiliation is by inferring from the statement that he had been Transportation Secretary under Jimmy Carter that he is a Democrat. Let me reiterate that:  His party affiliation is never explicitly mentioned .   Much is said by what is omitted.

      Wretchard at  urlLink Belmont Club   urlLink concluded an article about his generally optimistic tone about events in Fallujah  in the following way: That is the state of play. And within that web of doubt America must grapple with a single burning certainty: that unless it can bring a functioning democracy to the Middle East and militarily defeat the terrorist threat it will find its very national existence threatened. Optimism is a word for nothing left to lose. Is the Battle of Iraq in particular and the War Against Radical Islam in general really that important? Is this really a war of national survival?   Daniel Pipes thinks so.  urlLink In an interview published on his site   He forecasts: "There will be more attacks by Islamists on Americans. I can say this confidently because so many signs point in this direction. These assaults will awaken people. I expect it to be a one-way process of what I call education by murder. I do expect ever more Americans to worry; contrarily, I do not expect to hear many say, 'Well, I used to be worried about the threat of militant Islam, but no longer.' As time passes and more events occur, their assessment will become more realistic. Information such as  urlLink this article in  The Washington Post   would tend to butteress such claims. Indeed, at the end of this article, which discusses attempts by members of al Qaeda cells in Britain and France to create and use the deadly toxin Ricin, an expert in chemical and biological terrorism comments, "These are toxins that, if released in a enclosed space, could cause extreme harm," said Jeffrey M. Bale, an expert on chemical and biological terrorism at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. "There's no doubt that the groups we're seeing today could carry out such an attack. What surprises me is that that they haven't already done so."    Update, 5/7/04: This entry is so fragmentary, but I never seem to find time to get back to it. I'll try to iron it out over the weekend and make it coherent.

      If you ever thought that the abuses committed by the US Army personnel at the abu Ghraib prison were comparable to what Saddam's minions did throughout his long reign, go  urlLink see the movie linked to by Stephen Green . It's about 4 minutes and 25 seconds long. See if you can watch it all the way through. When you are done and you've cleaned up the lunch that you've lost by watching it, consider the following:  1. None of the Iraqis held at the abu Ghraib prison by the US were killed.  2. None were mutilated.  3. None even suffered significant personal harm.  If you can see that film and still say that what the men and women now being tried by the US military for their non-lethal crimes did was in any way comparable to what Saddam's torturers did, you've successfully converted your mind to a receptacle of propaganda.   Update: See also  urlLink this story at NRO.  I wonder if that amoral fucker Ted "abu Ghraib is under new management" Kennedy has seen it.

      I quoted various people about Reagan on June 5 but I didn't say anything about what I personally think of Reagan. Time has opened my eyes to the failures of his administration, particularly the administration's misguided attempts at nation building in Lebanon and the massive stupidity of the Iran-Contra deal (there was  never  an excuse for dealing with Iran in that way). Some have argued that Reagan created al Qaeda by subsidizing the Afghan  mujahedin  in their war against the Soviets and there's strong evidence that the anti-Soviet fighters moved easily into anti-American fighters after the Soviets withdrew (but then again that's 20-20 hindsight at work).   Knowing all this, though, I still admire Reagan. He gave us hope when those who came before his time gave us nothing but despair; he gave us prosperity when others could promise only lean times; he gave us pride when others told us to be ashamed of ourselves. He was the perfect man for the times and even though I know he was just a man, with all the flaws and failures any man has, he will always have a place in my heart.

      Ronald Wilson Reagan, a great president and a great American,  urlLink has died at the age of 93.    Words about Reagan:    urlLink From a man who saw the fall of Communism from the inside:   Throughout the 1980s, during the Polish Spring of "Solidarity", and then through the dark winter of the martial law, and the slow decomposition of the system, Ronald Reagan was our undisputed leader in the free republic of our hearts. He was our beacon of hope, someone who understood our condition and spoke about it in our language. The Western sophisticates sneered when he spoke about the "Evil Empire"; we knew it was evil and that it was an empire - we lived in it. They laughed at him when he said that communism is being consigned to the ash heap of history - how ignorant, how simplistic, how unrealistic - we, on the other hand, took heart because we knew that for him it wasn't just an empty rhetoric; he meant exactly what he said and had every intention of seeing it through. In the end, he had the last laugh.  urlLink From Wretchard at Belmont Club : The man who won Cold War died today. He couldn't take it with him, but left his legacy to billions of human beings. He was characterized as an idiot, an automaton and charlatan by many of his critics. Yet none of his detractors, however polished and poised, have changed the world so profoundly as this one man.  urlLink From the comment thread at Roger Simon's blog : I've just returned from laying some flowers and leaving a candle at the Reagan Library. The shrine that is growing is unbelieveable. It is most certainly local folks for the most part. The traffic isn't choking Madera Road yet, but the steady stream of cars up and down the hill to the library seems to be non-stop.   I've been up to the library too many times to count, I even vote there, yet this feels oddly different. People mourning, the odd touch on the shoulder, a brief hug from a stranger. This is beginning to feel something like November 1963, albeit the shock value of an assassination is missing.  Thankfully, the media haven't shown up yet...or if they have, they've left. I am dumbstruck with the outpouring of emotion that I encountered up there. Real grief and real gratitude for a man who shaped and revitalized this country when it was at one of its lowest points.   Posted by Lee @ 06/05/2004 09:38 PM PST   urlLink From President Bush : This is a sad hour in the life of America. A great American life has come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan. On behalf of our whole nation, Laura and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and our condolences.   Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that comes with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom. He leaves behind a nation he restored and a world he helped save.   During the years of President Reagan, America laid to rest an era of division and self-doubt. And because of his leadership, the world laid to rest an era of fear and tyranny. Now, in laying our leader to rest, we say thank you.   He always told us that for America, the best was yet to come. We comfort ourselves in the knowledge that this is true for him, too. His work is done, and now a shining city awaits him. May God bless Ronald Reagan.

      Sometimes it's good to think of all the things our warriors leave behind when they go to war, and all the sacrifices they make. I stumbled onto  urlLink this page  while looking for something else; I challenge you to read the messages there without getting a lump in your throat. Our warriors aren't the debased animals our media wants to depict, but rather men and women far from home whose loved ones miss them. Don't lose sight of that. No matter what their detractors want you to think, the men and women who represent America to the world are human beings.

God bless the fallen, who have sacrificed all for us; God bless the veterans, who served when they were needed; God bless our warriors, who stand before the enemy to protect us.

       urlLink FoxNews  reports that  urlLink CIA director George Tenet has resigned . In my opinion he should have resigned on September 12, 2001 -- or else Bush should have fired him -- but better late than never.  Who next? FoxNews speculates it could be Rep. Porter Goss, a former CIA intelligence officer. I don't know his agenda, or whether he favors the fundamental reforms that the Agency so desperately needs; I'll do some research and write again about this (promises, promises, I know).

       urlLink Wizbang  (link via  urlLink InstaPundit )&nbsp;found&nbsp; urlLink this remarkable passage &nbsp;in the 9/11 Commission's final report:  In this sense, 9/11 has taught us that terrorism against American interests “over there” should be regarded just as we regard terrorism against America “over here.” In this same sense, the American homeland is the planet. But the enemy is not just “terrorism,” some generic evil. This vagueness blurs the strategy. The catastrophic threat at this moment in history is more specific. It is the threat posed by Islamist terrorism —especially the al Qaeda network, its affiliates, and its ideology.   As we mentioned in chapter 2, Usama Bin Ladin and other Islamist terrorist leaders draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within one stream of Islam (a minority tradition), from at least Ibn Taimiyyah, through the founders of Wahhabism, through the Muslim Brotherhood, to Sayyid Qutb. That stream is motivated by religion and does not distinguish politics from religion, thus distorting both. It is further fed by grievances stressed by Bin Ladin and widely felt throughout the Muslim world—against the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, policies perceived as anti-Arab and anti-Muslim, and support of Israel. Bin Ladin and Islamist terrorists mean exactly what they say: to them America is the font of all evil, the “head of the snake,” and it must be converted or destroyed.  It is not a position with which Americans can bargain or negotiate. With it there is no common ground—not even respect for life—on which to begin a dialogue. It can only be destroyed or utterly isolated. There are two&nbsp;remarkable parts: (1) The claim that "the American homeland is the planet"; (2) The insistence that the radical stream of Islam can only be destroyed or isolated.   The first claim is essentially imperial. I hate using that word because others have misused and perverted it with vicious glee, but it's the only one that fits what I think the Commission is getting at, which is that America has so many interests&nbsp;in so many places that any threat anywhere must necessarily impinge on one of those interests. This recognition is much like the logic of empire as recognized by the British, especially with respect to India.   The second claim is the breathtaking one, coming as it does from a bipartisan commission. In frank, unambiguous language, a government body outside the control of the administration has said what the administration is probably thinking but cannot articulate, for fear of alienating its muslim allies: That there is a strain of Islam that cannot be allowed to spread, and must indeed be rolled back or destroyed. The commission has called down a  fatwa  on radical Islam in general and Wahhabism in particular. No wonder the major news outlets are&nbsp;ignoring this part of the&nbsp;commission's findings.&nbsp;

      My Dad -- a retired telecommunications engineer -- has always held that much of the recent warming trend can be attributed to&nbsp;the amount of energy produced by the Sun, as indicated by the number of sunspots -- more sunspots, hotter sun, warmer temperatures on Earth. Now  urlLink this study &nbsp;backs up his assertions. And Dad was saying this years ago! I'm proud of him.  &nbsp;  UPDATE (19 July 2004): More on this from  urlLink FuturePundit   (link via  urlLink InstaPundit  ).

      So it's another day of rain in southeast PA and all the frantic running around of the past few days has ground to a halt. I had two days off from work and I had vowed to use them to get all sorts of things done around the house. Some things I did, other things I started, and other things I ignored. Not a bad tally, considering my procrastinating tendencies, but I'm not willing to put any further effort out this week. I'm going to save my energies for work, which is going to be a treadmill in hell. Not to be too dramatic. &nbsp; Youngest stepson had a friend come for a sleepover. I could hear them horsing around at about 3:00 this morning, doing the things you do when you're a boy having a sleepover -- stay up late, engage in pointless but cool conspiracies, and then wake up and watch cartoons until it's time for the guest to go home. No worries. I miss "no worries."  &nbsp; Still, being an adult has more compensations than drawbacks, if you ask me. I don't have to go to school if I don't want to, Mom and Dad can't make me eat things I don't want to eat, I can get in the car and go somewhere without having to pester somebody to give me a ride, and people actually pay attention to what I have to say (well, most of the time). Yes, you have to work and pay bills and worry about the kids and think about the future, but you have much more control over your own fate. The older I get, the more I find that I like the idea of controlling my own fate.

      Drudge Report notes that  The New York Times  will feature  urlLink a story that reports  The collapse of the earth's magnetic field, which both guards the planet and guides many of its creatures, appears to have started in earnest about 150 years ago, the NY TIMES is planning to report on Page Ones Tuesday.   Science reporter Bill Broad has filed a report, according to newsroom sources, which explores how: 'The field's strength has waned 10 percent to 15 percent so far and this deterioration has accelerated of late, increasing debate over whether it portends a reversal of the lines of magnetic force that normally envelop the earth."  Broad explains: "During a reversal, the main field weakens, almost vanishes, and then reappears with opposite polarity. Afterward, compass needles that normally point north would point south, and during the thousands of years of transition much in the heavens and Earth would go askew."  Broad claims: "A reversal could knock out power grids, hurt astronauts and satellites, widen atmospheric ozone holes, send polar auroras flashing to the equator and confuse birds, fish and migratory animals that rely on the steadiness of the magnetic field as a navigation aid." So what should a concerned citizen do? I mean, aside from tossing out his compasses?

       urlLink This story  at  urlLink NRO  raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Have Bush's people already thrown in the towel? If so we should prepare ourselves for 4 to 8 years of interesting times -- even more interesting than what we have now.

      Yup, that's me, as interpreted by the  urlLink 20 Questions to a Better Personality  quiz (via  urlLink Tightly Wound , aka Big Arm Woman).   Wackiness: 24/100 Rationality: 56/100 Constructiveness: 44/100 Leadership: 46/100    You are an SRDF--Sober Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a font of knowledge. You are cool, analytical, intelligent and completely unfunny. Sometimes you slice through conversation with a cutting observation that causes silence and sidelong glances. You make a strong and lasting impression on everyone you meet, the quality of which depends more on their personality than yours.  You may feel persecuted, as you can become a target for fun. Still, you are focused enough on your work and secure enough in your abilities not to worry overly.  You are productive and invaluable to those you work for. You are loyal, steadfast, and conscientious. Your grooming is impeccable. You are in good shape.   You are kind of a tool, but you get things done. You are probably a week away from snapping.

      John Kerry does the first smart thing of his campaign and picks John Edwards. The conventional wisdom is that Edwards is a handsome, charismatic campaigner who will bring some shine to Kerry's otherwise lackluster campaign. From what I've seen, there's some truth to this; I saw one of his stump speeches when he was running for the Democratic nomination and his delivery was smooth and telegenic.   This is bad news for W. Cheney is a valuable, smart, tough man but he looks dowdy next to the young and healthy Edwards and his heart problems make him seem dangerously old by comparison. What's more, Edwards's experience as a trial lawyer will serve him well in the inevitable vice-presidential debate -- and will make Cheney look all the worse. Overall, Karl Rove has his work cut out for him.

      This is an interesting choice. Goss was once an intelligence officer at CIA, so the rap on him was that he would not aggressively attack the dysfunctional aspects of CIA -- which is to say, most of what the CIA is and does. This appointment might be Bush's way of saying to CIA personnel and their congressional supporters that, while he may be taking some of the DCI's power away by appointing an Intelligence Tsar, he's not going to completely eviscerate the Agency. If that's the message, it's disappointing, because CIA is one of the two agencies involved in the War Against Radical Islam that needs to be gutted and started over again (the other being the FBI). But maybe Goss will surprise us.

      Consider the following thought experiment: Congress has completely deregulated the airline industry. In response, an entrepreneur has founded Packenheet Airways. Packenheet is unique in that it allows anyone and everyone to carry a handgun onboard its flights, with these conditions:  1. There are no air marshals and no flight attendants.  2. The crew is sealed into an armor-lined cockpit and won't go into the passenger area except to save the aircraft from a crash.  3. You may carry only a handgun and 25 rounds of ammunition.  4. No long guns (e.g., shotgun, machine gun, rifle, etc.).  5. No weapon that shoots more than one round per trigger pull.  6. You and your baggage will be searched for anything that can purposely kill more than one human being at a time (e.g., bomb, chemicals, bioweapons, etc.). If such things are found, you may not board the flight.  7. You must sign a waiver that says that you cannot sue Packenheet Airways for anything, up to and including a crash caused by gunplay aboard the airliner, and may not make any insurance claims.  What's the incentive? The prices are dirt cheap and they'll fly anywhere you can land a modern airliner, no questions asked.  Would you fly on Packenheet Airways?

      I'm actually a little surprised by this outcome. The CIA has no doubt been lobbying hard to avoid such a position because it would unseat the DCI from his role as the president's chief intelligence advisor. However, this dual role made for a built-in conflict of interest, so there's good reason to subordinate the DCI to someone responsible only to the president.  The question now is whether an intelligence tsar would have the authority -- and the  ability  -- to enforce the president's wishes on a group of agencies that are accustomed to working autonomously and that have powerful allies in Congress. We shall see.
