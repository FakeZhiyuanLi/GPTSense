      Today was another one of those days. One of those days when you wished you hadn't awaken.  My "mom" had aranged for me to go sell rootbeer floats at Safeway, to help support prostate cancer. I was fine with that, nothing better to do during summer than sell rootbeer floats in a hot parking lot, to support a masculine cancer.   It was almost 2:30, and I was anxious to get done so i could go to Subway and get something to eat. Suddenly out of the doors stumbled this drunk man. He came over to the table and was muttering about how his wife lived a few blocks away and he was going to tell her we had pop, or something like that. Then he went back into the store, and I watched him go to the meat department, grab a ham, and shove it down his pants! He stumbled back to where I was, and stood there apparantly looking for his vehicle... I was thinking "Oh dear Godm he is going to drive." then my mouth said something totally different. "Sir, Take the pork out of your pants." I was like WTF? Where did that order come from. But he looked at me, smiled, bearing his ulgy yellow teeth, and plopped the ham down on the table then walked across the parking lot to the bus stop. I was too terrified to touch the ham, to my friend Demi had to come ant take it away for me.  That was one of the very few adventures i hope not to remember.  I don't kow why all this stuff happens to me! It seems wherever I go someone is doing something ridiculous. one day, i will live a normal life, just to see what it feels like!

      I seriously think that if my life were a sitcom, the seasons would never end, because nothing ceases to happen to me. I have a life where everything is comedic. Everywhere I go, something weird happens.  Today, I was Yard'n'garden. They sell plants and plant stuff, not really too many yard ornaments, but every once in awhile they will have some gnomes or a couple of those bird things that have the wings that spin in the wind, and those ceramic animals you fill with sand. Well, I was looking at some litte japanese maples to put in our yard next to our giant pillars by the front door, you know to make them less obvious, and this huge Harley Davison guy went to customer service. I was immediately drawn to take a closer look. (I was thinking 'Why would a biker want to go to yard'n'garden?) So I crouched down and pretended to be looking for a price tag on the tree. The biker asked the little old lady behind the desk if she had any of the little pink flamingos. She no, but they had some cute gnomes. The guy practically exploded! I thought he was going to kill the little woman! He yelled, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT HAVE THE FLAMINGOS! THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE A YARD STORE! HOW CAN YOU HAVE THE PINWHEELS, AND UGLY MEN, BUT NOT THE FLAMINGOS!" The lady calmly told the man that she thought the garden store down the road might have them. He slammed his fist down on the table, kicked over a coule of pots of flowers, and stormed out of the back fence. I stood up and took the maple over to the lady, and bought it cause I felt sorry for her (and I desperately wanted to draw less attention to the giant Greek pillars).  But yeah. That was really an interesting story, I dont know why that man was in dire need of pink flamingos, but i hope he wasn't upset because I happen to know that the Lil' garden store down the street only sells blue and purple flamingos.

      My mother is what is now known on my street as "The Greek Witch". She is 35, extremely bitchy, and always tired. No one likes to walk by our house. It's the small one with the unkept lawn, children's tricyles, and a battered Datsun in the driveway. It's the one house small children make up stories about. Lengends about my house:  Myth 1: Anyone who walks by the house is cursed for life.   Truth:  Anyone who walks by the house can hear an enraged woman screaming at her kids in Greek.  Myth 2: "The Witch" comes out at two in the morning at hunts down small woodland creatures for her lunch.   Truth: "The Witch" comes home at 6:30, and eats a half done TV dinner and comlains about having no money.  Myth 3: There is a small child locked in the basement, and you can hear it clawing the walls as it's fingernails break off.   Truth:  My twin brother is locked away in a youth correctional facility, and there is a large lizard in the basement, that tries to scratch it's way out.  There are many more just like this and it is rather funny, but now my mom is mad because I have a dance payment due, and I could only pay $100.00 of the $203.00 payment due and now I am screwed because I dont have a job, and my mom wont pay it. Anyone need a 16yr old Greek, Catholic nanny?

      Today was very different. I have come to the conclusion that our planet is being invaded by fat people in tie-died shirts.  My mother and I were at Safeway, and this  huge  lady in a tied-died shirt was standing in the middle of the pickle aisle. She had her cart and large body blocking the whole aisle. We were after the ketchup se was inconveniently standing in front of. I glanced at her, and she just stared at me. So i decided to maybe ask her to move. I said "Excuse me" and tried to get past her flub, but she just stood there, starring at the relish. Then she randomly grabbed the cart and shoved past me like  she  was mad at  me . So my mum and I were like, ok.... yeah. So we got our groceries and left. We were in the car and there was a group of 3 obese people waiting at the bus stop and they were all wearing tie-died shirts, me and my mum were joking and said that the fast relish gazing woman was probably part of their little clan.   THEN, we went to McDonalds to get something to eat, before I went to an Audition to be an extra in some movie "Nearing Grace" and we ate in the restaurant. There was a guy wearing a TD shirt, holding a small soda, just staring at the wall. My mum and I just started laughing, and he looked at us then took another drink. Then resumed looking at the wall. I mean it was just a plain white wall, but okay.  So we were laughing and driving home, and saw a bum pushing a cart in downtown portland. He was wearing a TD shirt and just walking like a robot. That's when we got all freaked out and were like AHH!  So just as a warning to all you people out there, Tie-Died shirt people are wandering around the country, pretending to be average civilians, but they are NOT. They are aliens from another planet and they want to turn us all into gazing hippe people. BEWARE. lol. actually it was all probably a coincidence, but you never know, so be careful, take a buddy if you walk in the dark! :)  Oh and, avoid the fat hippies that block pickle aisles. We may have to start our own Berlin Airlift. We shall call it The Safeway Aislelift. I donno.

      Let's just leave it at: Today was a bad, bad day. I went to go and find a job today, and picked up a few applications. I took them home a filled them out. Then I drove back to the places and delivered them. The first place was subway, and the lady took it and said she'd call me, so far so good. Then I went to this place in downtown, and they told me that I had to be 18. Ok, not so good.  My mom suggested Burgerville, there were two in our area, so I was like "Ah okay!" and we drove to one on Mill Plain blvd. I was filling out the form and the pen quit working. So naturally, I started scribbling vigorously on the paper, and I rippled it. The lady gave me a tape dispenser and i tried to tear the tape but flung the whole thing onto a nearby table, where it knocked over and elderly man's fries. *oops* So I finally turned it in. After watching the episode, my mom suggested we try the other Burgerville, maybe they would hire me if this one wouldn't. (We know they wont.) So we drove to Fourth Plain blvd. I went in and got the form and filled it out in the car, for safety measures. Then I went back in, and tripped over practically nothing. Everyone stared at me, as I dusted myself off. Trying to be all cool about it, I strided on over to tht counter and gave the paper to the lady. She told me I forgot to sign it, so i did, except.. well I forgot my name for a second and sort of just scribbled. The lady took it anyway (probably put ti in the paper shredder).    An overview:   Mill Plain:  Thinks I am a violent, fry killing, paper ripping, tape thrower.What place wants that? The Italian Mafia?  Fourth Plain:  Thinks I am a retard that cant spell her name and trips over ghosts. Maybe I could be a Goodwill Ghostbuster.   *sigh*  Just when i thought I was going to get a job and buy a car, so I could get myself around, I set aside a special time to embarass myself in public. Ah the fun of it. One of these days I swear I will get a job, if I have to tear apart Portland, and Vancouver!

      I have decided to label all my sites with, "the one with the" or "the one where" because FRIENDS is my all time favourite show and I think it's kind funny.   Today was really weird. I was going to Biology, and some really weird kid with a mullet, wanted me to sign his yearbook, and he wanted my phone number... I gave it to him, except the last number was wrong... Smooth. Then all these little friends of his wanted me to sign theirs too. I remember thinking, "When did I become famous!?" but hey, it's kind of cool, maybe I look like a celebrity, could I pass for Nicole Kidman? No. Oh well, I don't care, as long as I don't look like a porn star or something.  Also, I took my turtle for a walk. I think he misses Greece as much as I do. I wish I could go back and watch the Olympics, but I have commitments here, Dance and High School. School here doesn't get out until June 23. Wow. All because of some snow in December. I had never seen snow before I moved here. It was cold, and slightly painful, I hope it never does that again.  I have a big German Final tomorrow... AY! I know Greek, Italian, and English to an art, but I can speak German worth shit. Oh well, I have a C in that class and if I fail this it'll be a D. I would have a 4.0 if it weren't for that class.  I think I am going to quit now, I will update again tomorrow. Jees, I have 3 blogs, 2 on www.Xanga.com, and one on here. I am going a little crazy now, woo!

            Well I had an interesting time at dance camp a few days ago!      We went to a USA camp in Lacey Washington. It was, well interesting. There were only 5 teams including ours there. **We were the best** ;)        &nbsp;    We were out in the HOT HOT, sun all day for 4 days! ARGH! WE all had to wear the same tank tops with a sports bra under it, so we had 4 straps. The lines made us all look like red and brown Zebras! It hurts so badly! I thought I was going to pass out when they made us do kickline. Then we had some cheerleading exercises... YuCk. I hate cheerleading, it's so ugly. Ballet, modern, and jazz have some value, but cheerleading ICKY POO. I like pretty lyrical stuff. None of that pom-drill stuff, it's just so ugly, so is hiphop, the music is just yucky poopoo. Rock is okay... I grw up to rock.... woo hoo metallica, ac/dc, Aerosmith (may favourite band), def lepard, motley crue, sex pistols, van halen, you name it... but bring in the rap crap and i run. lol... :)        &nbsp;    Well that's about it, not much going on here. I am really tired, adn excited to go to church tomorrow... i donno why I am just exciteed for church.

      I had an adventure today. My mom's best friend wanted me to babysit her 8 year old son, and 2 year old daughter. I didn't have a problem with this, I have thirteen brothers and sister, handling two sounded like a cinch. I was all ready, i brought over a couple movies (Pirates of the Carribean and Bruce Almighty) and I was planning on a nice day, maybe taking them to the park, or going to run a few errands. But OH NOOOOO! The girl, Olivia (Liv) was nice. She was very quiet and didn't get into trouble, but Stevie was horrible!! He ran around the house like a wild animal and actually started barking at some point. Then when I was getting Livi some cereal, he hid in the closet and I couldn't find him, then he jumped out with a sqirt gun and started getting me all wet! I thought I was going to kill him right there! But i managed to calm him down for a little time and he started watching Pirates of the carribean, then he got up in the middle of the movie, and started hitting his sister with a pillow, which of course made her cry.... seriously i didn't know such a child could exist! SOOOO.... I chased him with a pillow and pummeled him until he just lied on the ground.... i thought I had killed the little bastard, but he got up and bit my leg! What a cannibalistic little freak. After that he went and resumed wathing his DVD. I put Livi to bed and was cleaning up the kitchen when I heard the screen door slam. I glanced up and Stevie was gone... The DVD had ended and he decided to go outside at 10:00 at night! So I went out looking for him and I couldn't find him, then i heard the lock on the door latch shut.... So i was outside for a half an hour.... then he let me in and went to bed.... weird....  When their parents got home they asked me how they were. "Oh they were great." I said She smiled and said she knew they would be... i was like oooh!!! You better be paying me a lot for this little episode! But they usually do, he's a doctor and she's a dentist... They gave me 150 for that night, i usually get that per month! Looks like me getting a 67' mustabg isn't going to be sucha  farfetched Idea!  That's about it for my blog today. Tomorrow will be good. My ENTIRE greek famiyl is coming over. 42 cousins, 10 aunts and 12 uncles... then my 4 grandparents... AY!

      I am definently an Insomniac. I cannot sleep! It's 12:58 and I have to be up at 6:30. This cannot be good. It just one of those times where you've tried  everything.    One : Play your Aerosmith CD 400 times.  My result : Actually getting into the song too much and dancing around the room, then tripping, and not being able to fall asleep because of the pain jutting through my arm.  Two : Take a Hot Bath.  My result : Ended up playing with my little brothers' rubber duckies and splashing water every where, then having to clean it up. Which made me hungry so I went and ate some raspberry sorbet. Upon which made me hyper because of the large quantity of sugar it contained.  Three : Read a Steven King Novel.  My result : The book scared the shit out of me, and I was too scared to get into bed without leaving the lights on, and I cannot sleep with the lights on no matter how hard I try.   Four : Work On your screenplay.  My result : I ended up yelling at the computer and slaming my fists on the keyboard becuase it froze up, which made the computer restart, and that angere4d me, so I went downstairs and put a FRIENDS DVD in.  Five : Drink a glass of warm milk.  My result : Did that, but realized I was lactose intolerant and the milk I drank wasn't soy. I threw up in the toilet and had a sore throat for an hour.  Six : clean your room.  My result : Cleaned it very well. Didn't make me tired enough to sleep.  So there you have it. I've really tried to go to sleep, but nothing works. My brothers and sisters are all asleep, all 13 of them! I cant sleep though.... Too bad.
