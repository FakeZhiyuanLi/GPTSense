        urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink    Appreciation  The Healing Heart of Annalena Tonelli  Humanitarian Gave Her Life to Helping Others  By David Brown Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday, October 8, 2003; Page C01    We live in an age of the hidden motive. Every action has a shadow life where its real truth lies, and we're told the wise person would best be on the lookout for it from the start. In many ways we're especially suspicious of selfless deeds. Even when goodness doesn't bring money, status and power, doesn't it pay off richly in some other egotistical currency?   Perhaps this is true, although it seems as naive a view as the one it purports to overthrow. But even if it is, there are people who are in some essential way exceptions to this weeding of human agency. Annalena Tonelli was one of them. Tonelli spent her adult life rescuing, treating and curing people with tuberculosis and other diseases in Somalia and Kenya.   She was a fearless and tireless person who also seemed incapable of discouragement. She was unsentimental and calculating when necessary. She eschewed organizations except for ones she created and could move -- or abandon -- at will, like the collection of desert people she so loved and admired. In her life -- 60 years, more than half of it spent in East Africa -- she saved thousands of lives. Three days ago, she lost hers.   According to wire service reports, Tonelli was shot twice in the head Sunday night when leaving a hospital for tuberculosis patients in Boorama, a city in northern Somalia. It is hard to imagine what the reason for this crime might be.   I met Tonelli 10 years ago when I went to Somalia to report on the late stage of the disastrous famine accompanying civil war in that country. I spent three days at an institution she established in Merca, a city on the Indian Ocean south of Mogadishu. She called it Koch Hospital -- a reference to Robert Koch, a German bacteriologist and early tuberculosis researcher -- rather than a more obvious name that would draw attention to the wasting and stigmatizing disease of its occupants.   At the time, it was the only place in Somalia treating tuberculosis patients correctly and adequately. She had 700 under her care, and 1,500 diagnosed and awaiting treatment, when I was there. The most ill, including about 100 children, stayed in three adjoining houses with courtyards she had refitted as open wards. Around town she and her assistant had rented more than 100 houses where patients, and often whole families, stayed while taking six months of antituberculosis drug therapy -- the essential, indivisible requirement for cure, and one especially difficult to apply in a country of nomads and people displaced by civil war. Tonelli fed them and treated them entirely for free. Patients came from the entire southern half of Somalia, most arriving emaciated and near death.   "If they die they die in the first or second day," she told me as we walked through one of the courtyards one morning. Under awnings skeleton men lay, or, if they were strong enough, sat on woven mats. At their heads were their few possessions: shoulder bags, hollowed gourdlike satchels, tea kettles. Each had a small earthenware spittoon that was given a layer of fresh sand each day at dawn. "If they take drugs for two weeks, it is done. Almost nobody dies then."   Done, but of course not over. Curing TB takes time and patience, and Tonelli had both in portions hard for an American to comprehend.   She grew up near Bologna. Her father was an economist and authority on cooperatives, her mother a homemaker. She was the second oldest of five children. A brother, Bruno, now a physician, still lives in their home town of Forli. It is the hub of several networks that raise money for his sister's work.   Tonelli was a bit of a child prodigy. She trained as a lawyer but most of all wanted to go into the developing world. "My family did not want it. So I took the first chance."   She arrived in East Africa in January 1969 and has worked there on and off ever since.   For many years she treated TB patients in northern Kenya. Most were ethnic Somalis, dry-land herdsmen. The patients would not stay in hospitals, and their families would not wait for them. Tonelli didn't try to change their ways. She built open-air treatment centers called manyattas, where people could stay for the half-year course of treatment. When it was time for a person to leave, she put the word out and the patient's family would magically appear in a week or so and pick him up.   She performed this work largely out of public view until 1985. That was when the Kenyan army was sent in to kill members of a local tribe with links to Somali guerrillas in Ethiopia. Hundreds of people were massacred and the wounded left to die.   "She took her Toyota, painted a red cross on it and went out into the desert with water," said Barbara Lefkow, 76, of Chevy Chase. At the time, Lefkow was the wife of an American diplomat in Nairobi and was also a physical therapist who worked on and off with Tonelli. "She and a few of her assistants picked up the survivors and brought them back to the rehab center. She saved some of them, and she made a list of the dead and gave it to me to smuggle out."   Tonelli's action and the publicity surrounding it led the Kenyan government to expel her. She returned to Italy, received training in Liverpool on treating tropical disease and eventually returned to Somalia to take up the work again.   The logistical difficulty of that work is hard to imagine. In Merca she supervised the purchase of fresh food for hundreds of people each day. She had a large local payroll to administer. And the key to curing TB is directly observing treatment -- watching every patient swallow his or her medicine every day. If she did not do it all personally -- she had helpers including trained physicians who worked with her for long periods -- she was nevertheless the person everyone wanted to see, the one who faced down the brigands when they snooped around, and heard the numberless personal supplications of patients.   As I followed her one day she moved with something beyond the self-preserving patience that clock-watching Westerners adopt to keep from going crazy in the developing world. It was an ability to see individuals at every moment. She refused to carry a radio that would interrupt her.   As one American aid worker who knew her in Merca said, "She has time for everybody. She is not easily distracted. It is a very saintly characteristic."   She lived with aesthetic simplicity, her chief source of pleasure several children, abandoned by their families, whom she adopted. Them, and the silence of the deep night when everyone was finally asleep.   "I was a small child when I felt like this," she said of her desire to find all she wanted in the service of others. "Many people speak of sacrifice, but for me it was never a sacrifice. I often felt there was nobody on Earth who had such a privilege as to live like this."   If pressed, she would admit she was religious. "I always feel the presence of God," she said one night as I quizzed her on the subject over dinner. She also would admit that her goodness was hard work.   "The reason that more people don't feel this way is that they don't try hard enough. You have to give time, you have to be patient; and then, year and after year, you'll see that what matters is only love. But if you're impatient because people are not grateful or you were full of limits, you will not be happy. You need time."   Annalena Tonelli had time, but not nearly enough.    © 2003 The Washington Post Company

      The Barnabas Fund, a UK-based human rights organization, is trying to bring attention to an unreported situation in Somalia. Crimes against Christians and westerners is on the rise, which will lead to further isolation of the country and the increase of Islamic fundamentalism.     Somalia is 99.5% Muslim and 0.5% Christian.     The tiny minority is being swallowed up by the murderous hatred of those following the Koran...to the 't'. An Islamist group in Mogadishu, Kulanka Culimada, issued a statement early last year stating that all Somali Christians were apostates from Islam and should be killed.      Now...have you heard any of this in the media? I didn't think so.      According to CNSNews, the Barnabas Fund, which works among Christians in Islamic nations, purported the threats were prompted by the Christian decision to send delegates to peace talks, which are currently being held in neighboring Kenya. Just like their cousins, the palestinians...'lovers' of peace.     It's amazing how very blatant the anti-Christian bias is in the major  media worldwide. For anyone else, they take out their violins. For Christians, they put in their earplugs...and put on their blinders.     I guess it's a media 'Merry Christmas'...mums the word.

      Have you ever heard of the "Mother Theresa of Africa"? This name had been given to an Italian nun, Sr. Annalena Tonneli, who worked in Somalia for thirty years, "founding," according to the Barnabas Fund, "a TB hospital, orphanages and schools." Evidently a woman of such accomplishment was an affront to Islam: she was murdered in Borama, Somaliland, on October 5, 2003, "by two armed men in front of the hospital."  The Barnabas Fund also reports that "in another attack on 20 October, a British couple in their sixties, Richard and Enid Eyeington, working for SOS Children’s villages in Somaliland were shot dead by several gunmen in their home inside the school compound while watching television. Also, in November a Kenyan Christian working for the Seventh Day Adventist mission in Gedo, South West Somalia, was murdered by Islamist radicals. The attacks appear to be deliberately anti-Christian and anti-Western.  Another event earlier in the year illustrates the continuing power of traditional Islamic legal restrictions on conversion from Islam: "In February 2003 a radical Somali Islamist group, Kulanka Culimada, based in Mogadishu issued a press release in which they called for all Somali Christians to be treated as apostates from Islam who ought to be killed. This was in response to a bold move by the tiny persecuted Christian community in Somalia that had sent several delegates to peace talks currently being held in Nairobi (initiated in 2002) to demand the right of freedom of religion and assembly, political representation, and free movement. The Christian representatives were shouted down by Muslim delegates who insisted Somalia had no Christians and who declared Islam to be the official religion of Somalia. This seems to mirror prejudices widely held by Muslim Somalis which justify violence against Christians, both indigenous and expatriate. . . .   "Most Somalis, over 99.5%, are Muslims who regard Christianity as a foreign religion of their historic enemies in Ethiopia and of their former colonial masters the Italians and the British. There is a long history of conflict between Muslim Somalis and Christian Ethiopians, so anti-Christian sentiment runs deep. Most Somalis take it for granted that a true Somali is a Muslim and converts to Christianity must be traitors. . . .   "Aid and mission work by Christian bodies in the colonial period resulted in a tiny Christian community of between five hundred to a thousand, mainly in the south. Church property and institutions were nationalized in 1972 and all mission work was stopped in 1974. Many Christian Somalis have fled abroad as a result of the wars, chaos, civil strife and instability which followed the collapse of Somalia in 1991. Christian churches were driven underground and have suffered much persecution. A number of believers have been imprisoned and martyred over the years. Evangelism is prohibited, and believers worship on Friday to avoid association with foreign Christianity. Most church buildings have collapsed and are in ruins." (Thanks to bgordon.)

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink    Sheik Nur Barud, the vice-chairman of the Kulanka Culimada, a terror group based in Mogadishu, Somalia   Somali Christians and Missionaries Murdered As anti-Christian violence spreads in devastated African nation By: Stefan J. Bos Special Correspondent, ASSIST News Service   MOGADISHU, SOMALIA (ANS) -- Several Christians and Westerners have been killed in violent attacks as anti-Christian violence spreads throughout the mainly Islamic, impoverished African nation, Barnabas Fund said Friday Dec. 19.  The Barnabas Fund, which supports Christians in the Islamic world, identified Italian nun Annalena Tonneli, known as the Mother Theresa of Africa, as among those Christians murdered in recent weeks along with several other missionary workers.  Sister Tonneli, who had served in Somalia for thirty years "founding a TB hospital, orphanages and schools," was killed October 5 by two armed men in front of the hospital, said Barnabas Fund in a statement seen by ASSIST News Service (ANS).  Soon after British couple Richard and Enid Eyeington, working for SOS Children's villages in Somaliland were shot dead October 20 by several gunmen in their home inside the school compound, while watching television, added the organization.   KENYAN CHRISTIAN KILLED   Last month a Kenyan Christian working for the Seventh Day Adventist mission in Gedo, South West Somalia, was reportedly murdered by Islamist radicals, although no more details were given.  The Barnabas Fund said "the attacks appear to be deliberately anti-Christian and anti-Western," and are likely linked to radical Somali Islamist group, Kulanka Culimada, which threatened with violence earlier this year.  This Mogadishu based group urged its supporters to treat all Somali Christians "as apostates from Islam who ought to be killed," after a tiny persecuted Christian community in Somalia sent several delegates to peace talks currently held in Nairobi.  CHRISTIANS DEMAND FREEDOM   The Christians had demanded the right of freedom of religion and assembly, political representation, and free movement, said Barnabas Fund, which has close contacts with church sources insight the country.   Christian representatives were reportedly "shouted down by Muslim delegates who insisted Somalia had no Christians and who declared Islam to be the official religion of Somalia."   Barnabas Fund said the verbal abuse "seems to mirror prejudices widely held by Muslim Somalis which justify violence against Christians, both indigenous and expatriate."  LAGACY OF HATRED   Complicating the situation is violence between different clans of war lords in the divided nation with reports that at least 60 people were killed and another 90 wounded in renewed fighting this week in the northwest part of Somalia's Galgadud Region.  Over 99 percent of the single party republic's six million people are Muslims, and analysts say many regard Christianity as a foreign religion of their historic enemies in Ethiopia and their former colonial masters, Italy and the Britain.   Aid and mission work by Christian bodies in the colonial period resulted in a tiny Christian community of up to one thousand people, mainly in the south.   CHURCHES NATIONALIZED   Church property and institutions were nationalized in 1972 and all mission work was stopped in 1974. "Many Christian Somalis have fled abroad as a result of the wars, chaos, civil strife and instability which followed the collapse of Somalia in 1991," said Barnabas Fund, a situation which apparently continued following the withdrawal of American forces in 1994.  Christian churches have been driven underground because of persecution and a number of believers have been imprisoned and martyred over the years, human rights organizations say.   "Evangelism is prohibited, and believers worship on Friday to avoid association with foreign Christianity. Most church buildings have collapsed and are in ruins," said Barnabas Fund which has often urged Christians around the world to pray for persecuted believers.

       3 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?'  "Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers. Isaiah 58    Prologue  Maxwell House and Nescafe, among others, are accused of exploiting poor coffee farmers by paying them too little in exchange of their produce. The fact that they do not practice “fair trade” attracts them lots of criticism and boycotts. The International Coffee Organization (ICO), of which Maxwell House and Nescafe are among its members, has been repeatedly requested to practice fair trade instead of their so-called “free trade.” a requested that has not yet yielded any fruits.     I believe that Christians should not drink now any coffee from Maxwell House and Nescafe until they come clean of the atrocities they are accused of like exploiting children and devouring poor coffee farmers of their profits. In the issue of slave labor, these two firms are indirectly involved in since they buy coffee from farms known to use slave children and adults as well. On the issue of exploiting farmers by not practicing fair trade, these two firms are directly involved in exploiting the poor farmers. In following pages, I will support my case against Maxwell and Nescafe and why I don’t believe that Christians should consume their black blood, their coffee.   Exploiting Poor Farmers?  Oxfam, a British charity organization, lashed out at ICO in September 2002 unveiling what it considers injustices done to poor coffee farmers by big Western coffee firms including Maxwell and Nescafe. According to this report, “farmers…receive only 1% of the price paid for a cup of coffee in London.”1  The charity said that it wants to highlight  “the plight of more than 25 million coffee farmers around the world who face economic ruin after the collapse in the price for coffee” (ibid). This is exacerbated by the fact 8% more coffee is produced daily than is consumed (ibid). The report continues to say that  the price of coffee beans has fallen about 50% in the past three years and is 30-year low. As a result, the report says, farmers in the developing countries are forced to sell their coffee beans less than the production cost.     The role of the big Western firms in the economic ruin of the poor farmers seems self evident given the fact that “the big four coffee companies - Kraft, Nestle, Procter & Gamble and Sara Lee - together buy almost half of the coffee beans produced around the world each year” (ibid). Firms of this purchasing power have certain power of the lives of poor coffee farmers. The exploitation power of these firms is best seen in contrast with that of the coffee beans producers since  “70% of the world's coffee is grown on farms of less than 10 hectares”.2  Oxfam documented that “an average of just 5% of the shop price of instant coffee reaches the farmer. It wants coffee companies - or roasters as they are known - to pay farmers enough to send their children to school, afford medicines and buy sufficient food. This is dramatized if one looks at the profit Nescafe reaps “an estimated 26% profit on its Nescafe and Gold Blend coffee brands” alone! (ibid).   Slave Labor?  Much has been said about the use of slave labor in many coffee beans farms in the developing world—a notion that neither Maxwell nor Nescafe ever denied its existence. But is it possible that Maxwell and Nescafe, among others, are reaping big profits from their businesses with the full knowledge that slaves, many of them pre-teen children, are forcibly used in those coffee beans? This is what I am going to examine now. The claim that these two firms make in saying that they don’t sell in the United Stated any coffee from farms suspected of slave labor is not of much help since they use these coffee beans else where.  Ivory Coast has been cited by many sources as a place where slave children and some slave adults are heavily used in the coffee beans farms, among others. Following is an overview of the immensity of the problem in Ivory Coast: ·	“Most of the boys who are enslaved are between the ages of 12 and 16, although some are as young as nine years old.  ·	According to Knight Ridder and other investigative pieces, these young children are lied to about jobs and wages and suffer through beatings, insufficient meals, lock ups at night, and workdays of more than 12 hours without breaks. They are separated from their families and live in fear.  ·	No extensive research findings are available on how many children are enslaved. The U.S. State Department’s 2000   Human Rights Report, however, estimates that 15,000 child slaves work on … coffee farms in Ivory Coast.”3  Having seen many sources of similar reports, I have concluded that Christians are better off not to drink Maxwell and Nescafe coffee since their product is tainted with human blood illegally sucked from poor enslaved children. It is obvious though that all coffee of Maxwell and Nescafe not traded fairly do not involve in slave labor.   I have been shocked and dismayed first how Maxwell and Nescafe do not trade fairly and exploit poor farmers. The issue of slave labor was simply for me the last straw that broke the camel’s back. Since Christians are required to reflect Christ, they must stand for what is right and reject what is wrong. Simply drinking Maxwell and Nescafe coffee ignoring the bitter taste of slave labor is unchristian at the best and encouraging slavery and exploitation at the worst.  What is worse is , (according to NY Times)4, many of the slave children are smuggled from neighboring countries and forcibly used as slave labor.  NY Times reported one incident in which a small boy fell a prey to human trafficker; “one week after leaving his village in neighboring Mali for the first time, Yacouba Diarra, then 14, fell into the hands of a trafficker of children and was smuggled across the border into Ivory Coast” in order to be used in slave farms” (ibid).   According to a recent report of U.S. Department of Labor, ”accurate statistics on the prevalence of child labor in coffee are scarce, though anecdotal evidence indicates that the occurrence is widespread in coffee producing countries around the world.”5  This evidence certainly adds significant weight that the Maxwell and Nescafe coffee is terribly tainted and unfit for Christian consumption.  If Maxwell and Nescafe distance themselves from exploiting children, directly and indirectly, and they offer fair price to the poor families in the developing countries that produce coffee beans, then Christians can use their coffee but in the mean time, it is wise for Christians not to consume the black blood of enslaved children and exploited poor farmers   Epilogue  The issue of slave child labor has terribly broken my heart. During my research, I found out that coffee farms are unsafe for children let alone slave children. Since coffee picking is exhausting work, it damages the psychological and physiological development. Snake bites and over exposure to sun inflict children untold pain beyond the comprehension of modern person.   Since protective-gear is virtually non-existent in Africa and uncommon in some Latin American countries, children suffer from the effects of fertilizers and other farm chemicals like pesticides. Christians should never accept this kind of treatment against children.   In 1996  I visited Wondogenet, a region in southern Ethiopia rich with coffee. I saw there many children from the Sidamo clan harvesting the coffee beans bare foot and without protective gears. Girls as young as seven were carrying bags more than their weight. I am not sure if any of them was slave but I know for certain that child labor and exploiting children are common in Ethiopia.

        “Men have broad and large chests, and small narrow hips, and more understanding than the women, who have but small and narrow breasts and broad hips”9 Martin Luther.    Introduction  In this short paper, I will examine what this great reformer had to say the issue of women. I will heavily depend on thirty nine Table Talks dealing with this issue and a book* that critically examines the table talks. These Table Talks were recorded from Luther from 1531 to 1544. I will also use a background all the 805 Table Talks recorded of him as shown by AGES Software. Many people (mostly feminists) see Luther today as a misogamist. Though misogamist merely means technically, a “hatred of marriage”, I am also using the word for its contemporary meaning, a “hater of women.” Thus this word is loaded with technical and contemporary meaning.  As we will see below, Luther had a low view of women and he was not alone indeed in his time. Luther lived in a time when women were seen as sub human. Luther and his contemporaries inherited much of their views on women from some of our church Fathers like Origin who despised women for who they were—women.  Luther thought that his view on women was biblical rather than cultural or traditional. He certainly knew that women could publicly pray and prophesy in the church (1Corinthians 11:1-16) they were not allowed to teach  or even to have authority over men (1Timothy 2:11-14). Luther also read from the Scriptures that women could not question or challenge the clergy in public (1Corinthians 14:34-38). Luther was therefore the product of his culture which was partly fed by some “restrictive” Pauline writings.    The Church Fathers   Many of the church Fathers had demonized women. Tertullian (AD 155 - 245) said ““You [women] are the devil's gateway.1  He also said that “Woman is a source of temptation.”2  St. Clement of Alexandria (c150-c215), the Greek Father of the Church,   also said in his book, Paedagogus  “"the consciousness of their own nature must evoke feelings of shame."3 Saint Origen (c185-254) castrated himself at age eighteen and claimed that “women were worse than animals because of their over flowing lust.” St. Ambrose (c339-397), a Doctor of the Church who was the  Bishop of Milan said “Remember that God took the rib out of Adam's body, not a part of his soul, to make her. She was not made in the image of God, like man."5 St. John Chrysostom (c347-407), Doctor of the Church who was also the  Bishop of Constantinople said "It does not profit a man to marry. For what is a woman but an enemy of friendship, an inescapable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a domestic danger, delectable mischief, a fault in nature, painted with beautiful colors?"6   Martin Luther  According to the Table Talks we will examine, Luther is misogynist par excellance and little can we blame him since many of his heroes, the Church Fathers, were sworn misogynist who though that their understanding of women was scriptural.  In his Table Talks “Of Marriage and Celibacy,” Luther did not hide his allegiance to the Church Fathers especially on the issues at hand like the topic of marriage and celibacy and women in general. In fact, Luther quoted Saint Augustine when he said: “St. Augustine said, finely: A marriage without children is the world without sun.”7 This may not seems utterly embarrassing given the understanding of the people at that time regarding marriage but Luther in fact said worse things to make him a misogamist. Luther, unlike Origen and some of his contemporaries, advocated for matrimony as is seen when he said “Let the contemners and rejecters of matrimony go hang, the Anabaptists and Adamites, who recognize not marriage, but live all together like animals and the papists, who reject married life, and yet have strumpets; if they must needs contemn matrimony, let them be consistent, and keep no concubines.”8  But the case against Luther is overwhelming when it comes to his view of women and how he belittled them like when he said:  “Men have broad and large chests, and small narrow hips, and more understanding than the women, who have but small and narrow breasts and broad hips, to the end they should remain at home, sit still, keep house, and bear and bring up children.”9 “Never any good came out of female domination. God created Adam master and lord of living creatures, but Eve spoilt all, when she persuaded him to set himself above God’s will. ‘T is you women, with your tricks and artifices, that lead men into error.”10  One may wonder what happened to the esteemed Father of the reformation! It doesn’t take a genius to ask where in the Scriptures does Luther base his arguments as quoted above? The answer is merely no where. It is only old tradition and Hellenistic Greek that influenced the reformer.    It seems that the reformer sometimes argued from Scriptures or silence from Scriptures to show that women were inferior to men. Luther may have thought that since all of the 12 disciples of the Lord were men,  it showed that the Lord preferred men over women and that could be why many churches don’t ordain women today. The fact that the Lord did not choose women as part of his 12 disciples should be attributed to the mail dominated culture in which they lived as this quote eloquently expresses it: In Jesus time, “All religious leaders - whether priests, scribes, Pharisees or rabbis - were men. If this was the religious climate of the day, need we be surprised that Jesus called only men to be his apostles? To put it differently: entrusting the ministry to women would have required a profound social revolution, even more than a religious reform. Even if Jesus had wanted to overthrow the social structures of his society, it would be doubtful if he could have achieved this in so short a time. A centuries-old social myth that is ingrained in the texture of people's life and thought cannot be uprooted even by a God-man through three years of preaching. But Jesus did not want to effect an immediate social liberation.11  It is certainly unbecoming to argue from silence in an attempt to establish a norm. Though it is true that all of the 12 disciples were men, that had nothing to do with broad and large breasts and small and narrow hips as Luther mentioned as important factors to determine the dominance of men over women.   It is most certain that certain Pauline texts contributed the way Luther saw women. The so called “restrictive texts” of Paul cause great controversies among NT scholars. It is interesting though, that Luther never demanded women to veil their heads when praying or prophesying as 1Corinthians 11 demands: “Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 5And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. 6If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.” In chapter 14 of the same epistle, the apostle instructs women not speak in the church “34As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. 35If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.”  It is noteworthy that Luther never reinforced this much debated instruction from the apostle but resorted to trivial distinctions between the sexes. It is also important to note that Jesus allowed only one reason for divorce, adultery. But Luther recommended a man to divorce his wife if she does not recognize his call to ministry and therefore fails to support him by following him wherever his ministry took them.13 Compare it to table talk # 747.   Conclusion  Luther was certainly a very contradicting man when it came to his view on women. He sometimes sounded a strong champion for women’s rights like when he was reported to have said this “Dr. Luther said, in reference to those who write satirical attacks upon women, that such will not go unpunished. If the author be one of high rank, rest assured he is not really of noble origin, but a surreptitious intruder into the family. What defects women have, we must check them for in private, gently by word of month, for woman is frail vessel. The doctor then turned round and said let us talk about something else.”12     Was Luther talking about himself here? Was he not from a noble origin? Was he not sober when, on many occasions, he spoke so lowly of women? It is certainly fair to say that Luther saw women as weak creatures lower than men in many ways.  The authenticity and the reliability of the table Talks are not in question at all. Preserved Smith explains that in depth in the above mentioned book on the table Talks.

The answer is certainly simple for us but our fellow Somali Muslims will not understand this. We know that Somali Muslims call us “the walking dead” who can drop any time because they can usually take our lives at their will.      We all remember the Mogadishu underground house church where 12 of the 14 members were assassinated for their faith several years ago. For a Somali Muslim, a faith in Christ brings “death and destruction” but for us, Somali Christians, a faith in Christ Jesus brings eternal salvation—Liibaan, Dr. Gobe, Professor Xaaji, among others [Somali martyrs], know this first hand for they were killed for their faith and they are with the living Lord now. So for us, calling on the name of the Lord can bring to us physical death but our persecutors can’t touch our soul!   Verse 13 clearly tells us that everyone who calls on the name of Jesus will be saved. Let us examine now what other passages of the Bible say about salvation in the name of the Lord.   Salvation in the Bible    27Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, 28so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. Hebrews 9.  28"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Matthew 11.   16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. John 3.   17The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life. Revelation 22.  32 And everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved; for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be deliverance, as the LORD has said, among the survivors  whom the LORD calls. Joel 2.        It indeed sounds too good to be true that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of all sinners or that he would take the sins of some who are “deep” in sin. Martin Luther calls this “the blessed exchange” because Jesus takes our ugly sins and gives us his righteousness.   In verse 14, Paul asks three basic and thoughtful questions: 1. How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? 2. How can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? 3. How can they hear without someone preaching to them?  The answer should also be basic but thoughtful: 1. One can’t call for help unless one believes help is available! 2. One can’t believe in Christ unless one hears of him! 3. Since one can’t hear of Christ without a preacher, we should all preach (Mt 28:19-20)       Verse 15 tells us that we should all share the Good News for we are all the ambassadors of the living Lord “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you” John 20:21. Apostle Paul also said ““For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for necessity is laid upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!" 1Corinthians 9:16.      “Feet” tell the preparation to preach the Good News “With your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace (Ephesians 6:15).         Brothers and sisters in the Lord, let us take the call of the Lord very seriously and have more passion for the lost. Let us acknowledge together that it is our responsibility to propagate the Good News; if we don’t do it,  who will do it? We know that our fellow Muslim Somalis can be very violent and murderous towards us but that shouldn’t stop us from our mission of sharing Jesus with the lost.       Let me conclude with this passage:  15But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1Peter 3.    Source:   BLib 9167

       Internationalist versus Nationalist     DISCOVERY Introduction  Though the book of Jonah is unity and reads progressively, we will focus only on chapter four for one main reason: “the main purpose of the book is almost universally found in chapter 4”1 and we will examine it very carefully. The name Jonah means “dove” but the nationalist was anything but a dove.       Given how the people in Nineveh responded to God and repented of their sins, it is tempting to assume that Jonah was a great missionary-evangelist, a kind of older version of Billy Graham. The success of the ministry is due to God’s grace than the skills or the benevolence of the brimstone-preaching prophet.         Verses 10-11 tell us how Jonah misread God. The miscalculating prophet was instructed to “arise” and “go to Nineveh” (1:2 RSV). Jonah “rose” (1:3) but he fled in exactly the opposite direction of Nineveh, Jonah ended up in Tartessus in southern Spain, not because he was lost but because he was full of vengeance and arrogance (4:2). Given the contradictions characterized in Jonah and his outrageous hypocrisy, it is not impossible to imagine that, while running away from God, he was meditating on Psalm 139:7-12! In fact, Jonah is rightly called “the object of satiric ridicule in the OT book that bears his name.”2      Theological Plot  Chapter 4 of Jonah in particular, and the entire book in general, is theological than prophetical though the book is one of the books referred as the XII Prophets.  The genre of this chapter, and the entire book for that matter, is history. In the sense that this chapter, like the entire book, has few characters with some good subplots is best described as novella since its characterization is not really that well rounded as expected.         Some Hebrew Bible theologians regard this book as allegory composed to counter the exclusivism of Ezra, Nehemiah and Esther. In this school of thought, the prophet stands for disobedient Israel, the sea for the unbelieving Gentiles, and the huge fish for Babylon, and finally the three days in the belly of the fish represents the duration of the Babylonian captivity of the Jews. Most theologians who subscribe to this interpretation date the book around the postexilic date of 760 BC. This very school of thought considers psalm 2:2-9 as a later interpolation. In any case the book shows the fingerprints of the sixty-century Judean editor.      In the entire Bible, the 2 Covenants, Jonah is portrayed as a real prophet and his story authentic as seen in 2 Kings 14:25-27 where he is said to be the son of Amittai, from Gath Hepher in Galilee. In Matthew 12:39-41, Jesus compares his own resurrection from the dead to the dislodging of Jonah from the belly of the fish. Jesus says in the Gospel of Luke “The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.” (11:32). The kenosis theorists of course say that Jesus’ knowledge was restricted because of the kenosis. Others went far as to suggest that the Synoptic gospels’ mention of Jonah is a later interpolation! As incredible as it may sound, this is a growing tendency among students of modern criticism.         In fact, Jonah was seen as historical until the nineteenth century when J.G. Eichhorn challenged this view in 1823. People who do not accept Jonah as history are naturally allergic to miracles—they cannot stand them for they think them impossible. It is therefore the big fish which swallows Jonah and the plant that shades him which are stumbling blocks to those who would not take Jonah as history.        One ancient Jewish tradition says that Jonah was the son of the widow of Zarephath; this is the child who Elijah raised from the dead. In any case, Jonah is historical and not allegorical or parabolic.        One can still benefit, though poorly, from Jonah even if he or she believes the book is not historical but parabolic. This designation certainly diminishes the value of the book but it would still have a lot to offer. The answer to the core question, “What right do you have to be angry?” (4:4:4, 9) is still  “None!”3       Jonah was sent to Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire. It is suggested that Jonah was a contemporary of Hosea and Amos since his ministry was dated during the reign of Jeroboam II (793-753 BC) (2 Kings 14:25-27).        Chapter 4 of the book is about how Jonah rejected the grace of God. This chapter is brimming with the selfish complaints of Jonah, the great nationalist who is the foil in the narrative. But God is a greater internationalist and the hero of the narrative. The whole narrative in this chapter is about how graceful God is and how his mercy transcends tribal and geographic boundaries.    Question Being Answered  The human problem this text is dealing with is the narrow-mindedness and the selfishness of the humankind. By nature, people do not like their enemies and they wish them nothing good for them but doom and destruction. This passage is telling its hearers and readers that God is God for all, believers and unbelievers and that he wants them saved. Jonah did not obviously want the Assyrians to be saved so he tirelessly tried to thwart and frustrate God’s salvation plan for them. Jonah wanted the 600,000 people in Nineveh perished without God! Jonah did not learn his lesson well.       Jonah was merely supposed to be an instrument of God and to adhere to the instructions given as seen in the text but he chose to ignore them in letter and in spirit. When God did not eradicate the people in Nineveh, as Jonah would have liked, Jonah asked God to kill him because he could not stand Assyrians worshiping YHWH!    Response of the Reader  The text shows the folly of Jonah and the grace of God. The text wants readers to side with God and to distance themselves from the bigotry of the exclusivist Hebrew prophet. The human dilemma is obvious here: we naturally want our enemies to suffer. God is telling readers through the text that we should not hate our enemies. Jonah is here as an object lesson. God knew that there was no love lost between Assyrians and Hebrews and he chose to send a Hebrew prophet to Assyria to preach repentance!        God’s answer is simple and straightforward; all people are my people and I want them saved and reconciled whether they love or hate one another. The desired response as informed to us by the literary form of the text is to accept and rejoice in the grace of God as manifested in his dealings with the people in Nineveh and to see the shallow-mindedness of the confused prophet.     Vision of God  This text tells us much about God. It portrays God as an internationalist, loving and caring.  It tells us how patient God is and how his love endures forever.       We see in this passage how God saves the Ninevites, how he prepares a vine like plant overnight, how he prepares a worm to destroy it to teach the run-away prophet a lesson and   to challenge him. We also see how genuine God is in saving people. No one is simply outside the grace of God. We will see how no human being can thwart and frustrate God’s redemptive plan—no Jonah or Judas is able to stop God from saving his people.    The Misguided Prophet  In case some of the audience were too optimistic to understand why Jonah fled to Europe instead of going to modern day Iraq, Jonah relieves them of their doubt by his feelings in 4:1. In fact, a literal translation of the Hebrew of this verse would read, “it became evil/wrong to Jonah.”4 Jonah wanted people in Nineveh to be destroyed well into chapter 4:5. In verse two, we see that Jonah knew how graceful God is but he never wanted to admit that. He wanted to use God as a  kind of tribal deity exclusively for Israel. In verse three, Jonah prays God to take his life. It can be assumed now that Jonah wanted to die when he asked the sailors to throw him overboard but the Lord saved him. This prayer shows another futile attempt to die since he cannot face the generosity of the gracious God. Jonah’s prayer for death reminds one Elijah’s prayer for the same fate in (1 Kings 19:4).        In verse four, God asks Jonah the famous condemning question “have you any right to be angry (NIV)?” In verse five, Jonah is still shown stubborn, cold and calculating. In fact, his exiting of the city and sitting outside it indicates that he is waiting for a Sodom and Gomorrah like destruction to engulf the inhabitants of the city. In verse six, God protects Jonah from the severe tropical sun by providing a miraculous plant to shade him. Jonah was overjoyed with the plant and he saw it as a welcome relief from the merciless Mesopotamian heat.        In verse seven, Jonah’s shading plant is gone for good after one day of cooling him. A worm ate it. Jonah certainly missed its shade giving big and thick leaves. In verse eight, we see one more glimpse of Jonah’s selfish nature. He begs God to take his life after the scorching east wind beats on him. He proclaims “death is better to me than life.”       In verse nine, God addresses Jonah and tells him that the plant was only an object lesson and that Jonah failed miserably. God asks Jonah the same question in verse four—the same wording any way “Do you have a good reason to be angry about the plant? Jonah’s response shows that the prophet of doom did not learn his lesson yet. It becomes more evident that Jonah saw the plant to be more important than the numerous people in Nineveh. Jonah wanted the plant alive and the people struck down by God. In fact “the right to be angry” holds the book together—it is a unifying theme and the kernel of the whole narrative.        In verses ten and eleven, God challenges Jonah. He asks him about his mixed up priorities. For Jonah, the plant that grew over night was more desirable than the 12,000 children and their families in Nineveh.     HOMILETICAL RATIONALE  Exegeting the Class & the Text  The audience for this sermon is my preaching class. This is a graduate level school. We are trained well to be worthy ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ; we are learning about God, theology and doctrines of the Church. Many of us have some knowledge of the original languages of the Bible. It is my concern, since it is said that familiarity breeds contempt, to let our hearts grow smaller and our heads bigger because of our good knowledge of the Word!        Jonah knew God. He was a Hebrew, the elected people of God. He was chosen to be a prophet—he was certainly equipped to share the good news. But as he learned more about God and studied theology and doctrines, as a faithful believing Hebrew, his heart grew smaller and his head bigger.       Head knowledge is very dangerous. We can become too mechanical and too rigid. We can lose concern for the lost, especially for our enemies. It is tempting to try to communicate from our ivory towers and lose contact with the real world.           Since the bottom-line of the narrative could be “how not to be a prophet”, I will weave through my preaching the concept “how not to be an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ.” Following is the raw material for my sermon:   Audience: My Fellow Classmates   Chapter four of Jonah is the core of the whole book; it is the bottom line of the four-chapter short narrative. It is obviously not the first time we heard this passage. In fact, this story of Jonah with its big fish and interesting plant is extremely famous—even Bible illiterates can recognize it!     It goes without saying that we are not Bible illiterates. We are seminarians, students of the Bible. We have some of the finest professors in the trade as our lecturers. But this is my question: What was your reaction few minutes ago when you heard this passage? Were you overcome with “the fear of the Lord” or hesed for the lost?       I went to Bible college in Ethiopia, East Africa. Many Ethiopian Christians, both protestant and Orthodox, do not like Bible colleges and seminaries—they believe that they are thinly disguised Bible cemeteries. “Theology makes people dry” is their slogan. Let me see if my fellow Ethiopians are right: When you heard me read this passage, did you feel uncomfortable because of the miracles in the narrative? Did you say in your heart “this cannot be real, it must be a parable or allegory?” Did you wonder what Jonah was eating while he sat east of the city frustrated because of God’s grace? Did you ask yourself “boy, how could a plant grow that fast” or how fast could a tiny worm eat up all that shade giving plant?       My fellow classmates, trying to explain the mechanics of miracles kills the story and eventually the faith of the person. Our God is a God of miracles—we do not have to fear miracles.  God is calling each one of us to be his witness in one way or another. If God chooses you to send you to Tikrit, the ancestral home of Saddam, or anywhere in the so-called “Sunni Triangle” in Iraq to preach a message of repentance, would you do that?       What about if God sent you to no man’s land between Afghanistan and Pakistan where Osama Binladen is considered a hero—would you really go there to preach or would you say from a distance “forty days, and Tikrit is overturned?!” “Twenty days and the Taliban will be destroyed!”  It is easy for us to look at Jonah and laugh at him but let us watch out for we are not Jonah-free ourselves. Somewhere, sometime, somehow we can see a “Jonah” in us! When that happens we need to repent and let God be God and everyone else a liar—including us!     Source:  BLib 1204    Endnote    1.

        16He [the beast] also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, 17so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. 18This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it  is man's number. His number is 666. Revelation 13    Prologue  What does the mark mean? What is the significance of 666? What does it mean? To answer all these questions, I will critically interpret the history of this two thousand year old mystery. This symbol generates great curiosity among many people and volumes of works have been written on it. In fact, the Google search engine pulls out 2,950,000 entries for “666”! This further indicates the depth of the subject matter. It is also noteworthy that the symbol has been abused and read into to promote unhealthy and non-Christian theology.  In this paper, I will argue that the number of the beast, 666, is merely the name of the beast and not a magical number of any kind. I will show that John indeed identified the mark (666) with the beast for he clearly states that the mark is the name of the beast. Therefore there is no need to read the text backwards starting with the mark in order to identify a certain beast—this is the eisegesis I will argue against.   In Search of the Beast   The symbol 666 has been misinterpreted and misused for millennia. I will now survey some of its most significant misuses. Many people, like Gary Blevins1, believe that the mark will be an invisible laser tattoo injected under the skin or a microchip that will be placed under the skin for scanning at the point of trade. Such people ignore the fact that the original audience of the book, for whom Revelation was written, understood what John had communicated to them. Therefore, since lasers and microchips were virtually unknown 2000 years ago, this “interpretation” should be discarded.     Other people like Blevins are literally obsessed with the number 666 and look for names that match them to identify the beast. Needless to say, such people can get stockpiles of names like the one Blevins2 mentions in his book, Ronald Wilson Reagan! It is interesting, though, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan are still haunted by this number. The Reagans retired to a house in 1989 at 666 St. Cloud Road, Beverly Hills.  Nancy had the address changed to 668!  Others do not count the letters of peoples’ names to identify them with the beast but they look at their character, political affiliation and philosophy to see if they are the rightful owners of the mark, 666. Some of the people identified with the beast and given the mark include:  Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Anwar el-Sadat, David Rockefeller, Pat Robertson, Pope John Paul II, Martin Luther, Nero Caesar, Benito Mussolini, Jimmy Carter, Bill Gates, Mikhail Gorbachev, John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger. Other world known figures identified with the beast  in their time include: Willy Brandt, Caligula, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Emperor Frederick II of Germany, King George II of England, Emperor Justinian, Ayatollah Ruhulah Khomeini, Nikita Khrushchev, Sun Myung Moon, Napoleon Bonaparte,Czar Peter the Great, Pete Seeger, Josef Stalin, Kaiser Wilhelm and  Boris Yeltsin.  Other people like, Tal Brooke3, are more radical as they believe that global banking, laser scanning, and the universal bar codes are part of the 666! Brooke and others like him shun all signs of world unity including unity and the oneness of the Church and they see  World Council of Churches (WCC) and similar organizations as a sign of satanic globalism!—obviously ignoring the fact that unity and oneness of the Church is what Christ prayed for! (John 17:11). Others, including M.J. Agee, believe that the mark may even be used as it appears in the Greek, , pointing out that the  middle letter, xi, resembles a serpent4; since serpent became a kind of Satan’s nickname in the Bible, this is not a bad exegesis though too simplistic.  The newest edition of Oxyrhynchus Papyri contains a fragmented papyrus of Revelation which dates around 3rd century. This papyrus gives the beast number 616 instead of the customary 666. This was the western Roman Empire where Latin was dominant. Needless to say, 665 was not also uncommon. Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp,  quotes and refutes this 616 number5 but this papyrus is the earliest ever found giving the beast this odd number (see attachment #1).  But one may wonder why numbers matter. In fact, during the Roman era, numbers fascinated educated Greeks and playing games based on numerals was a popular pastime. This process was known gematria in Hebrew and isopsephia in Greek. The Greek numerals are represented by letters. For example, alpha =1, beta = 2 and theta = 9, and so on (see attachment #2). The quote below best illustrates the power of numerals among Roman era Greeks:  	“This “popular parlour-game”…could be given a satirical or polemical slant. If numbers 	can equal words and phrases, they can also equal proper names. Take the Emperor Nero 	….In Greek, he is NERON (with an omega). Add up the values of these letters and you 	get 1005. Add up the letters of IDIAN METERA APEKTEINE (killed his own mother) 	and you also get 1005. So Nero = killed his own mother.”6  It was thus easy to go from a word to its number and this did not take a rocket scientist. It only required some one who could read and add numerals as there was only one way to do it and it is impossible, though, to go backwards from the number to the name (words).        John’s readers were familiar with the letter and number ratio as that was known by all who used letters of the alphabet for numerical systems. This process was always used to conceal the identity of the person in question. A well-known graffito by Pompeii (c. AD 79) says “I love her whose number is 545.” It is obvious that only those who knew her name or the names of the candidates could unlock this puzzle. It will be insane if a modern person tried now to figure out her name! Furthermore, The Hebrew letters of Balaam amount to 666 and the name of Jesus in Greek equals 888.    Many have suggested, too, that Nero was the beast (with the mark 666) implying that John’s prophecy was already fulfilled. This means that no beast, whether his number is 666, 616, or 665, will ever show up again. This school of thought believes that Revelation is not a prophesy of what is to come but a relation with the immediate application of then and there in the first century. This view is known as preterist.            One reason people held this is the fact that Nero portrayed many of the evil signs of the beast. However, another reason is related to his name because the transliteration of Neron Caesar, his official name, into Hebrew is nrwn qsr that total the number 666. Even if spelled without the final n, it also becomes 616 counting for the other variant reading. Furthermore, Nero was known among his contemporaries as a “beast” because of his ruthless behavior and poor ethics.  F.F. Bruce, puzzled by how people were obsessed with number said: “The three rules for making any name yield the desired 666 are: (1) if the proper name itself will not yield it, add a title; (2) if the sum cannot be found in Greek, try Latin, or Hebrew; (3) if that does not work, misspell it!”7 Volkmar, Kliefoth and Moffatt said that the number is that of a specific individual though they did not name that person. However, it is important to know that John expected his audience to know the beast he was describing to them. John never meant to confuse his audience—he wanted them to inform. Believers who saw (or will see) the beast had (will have) no trouble recognizing him. Believers should therefore avoid the supersonic prophets who are using bizarre and arcane tactics to identify the beast—this is beside the point John was making for he never intended to be mysterious.   However, believers should not be caught up in this fanatic gematria because there is nothing that is magic with the generic number 666. For example, the Holy Bible equals 666 in gematria! Here is the how it works:   H	  72 O	  79 L	  76 Y	  89 	 B	  66 I 	  73 B	  66 L	  76 E	  69    Total 666         The above values I used are in fact ASCII computer alphabet code where, for example, A= 65 and Z=90. This computing system is internationally recognized and used as well. But this was merely to show that those who fiddle with numbers can make them say for them anything they want to hear. What numbers can be done is virtually infinite. Such gematria doesn’t lead to any conclusion as it leads to every conclusion there is and this shows its deficiency. I pray that the madness of the “Christian” gematria stops here. One thing we can learn from this number, 666, is that God’s enemies are numbered and that their deception will be over.     The Beast John Saw  Reading Revelation in its entirety makes clear that that John perceived Empire wide persecution in his time. Reliable sources indicate that such persecution did not take place until well into the 3rd century. However, it is absolutely possible, and it is the likelihood, that John had Nero in mind when he was describing the Beast with the mark as “a man’s name” (13:18 NEB) indicates. Nero portrayed many of the characteristics of the beast including his demanding of his subject to address him as Lord and God. Nero also put a cast image of him in the imperial cult temples to be worshipped (cf. 13:14).     In his description of the beast, John presents to his audience some evil characteristics of Rome and her emperors, particularly Nero, known to his audience. The very description of the beast by John reminds his audience the evil inherent in the system and its emperors. As Andy Johnson put it eloquently:  “…Nero sat for the portrait that aspects of the beast was pattered after.”8  It is also possible, that John had only one person in mind— one and only one and intended his audience to understand it that way as “a man’s name” (13:18 NEB) indicates. This, though, does not rule out the fact that more beasts could emerge in the future as many emerged in the past and some are roaming around today propagating idolatry and blaspheming against the name of the Lord.   There is nothing in the text to indicate that the mark of the beast is literal though we should take the beast seriously. John did not obviously want his readers to take the beast with seven heads and ten horns literally. Why should he then expect them to take the mark literally? It is beside the point to use the mark 666 as magic jigsaw puzzle to predict the future.  When Revelation was read in worship services for praise and worship, the challenge was never to name the “beast” who was persecuting the church by calculating the number (13:18)—they already knew it but it was  to recall and recognize what it was—that it was a beast empowered and used by Satan against the church. In fact, a more accurate translation of the exhortation of 13:18a would be “It is the moment to have discernment” (Ellul’s translation). This translation draws the attention of today’s reader from the frantic decoding fever manifested in today’s “Christian” bookstores “ to discerning where in our own time propaganda is used to idolize political power.”9  John was limited by the culture he lived in and the language he used. John well knew that number seven is a number of completeness like when he speaks about the seventh seal, the seventh bowl and the seventh trumpet. John also uses number six as one of incompleteness and judgment—a judgment which comes in the sixth seal 6:12-17 (physical disturbances), in the sixth trumpet 9:13-21 (mankind killed) and the sixth bowl 16:12-16 (Euphrates dried). John and other believers lived under the sixth Roman Emperor known for his brutality. “Six-six-six” is thus the intensive symbolic expression of incompleteness, idolatry, judgment, and non-fulfillment, evil itself raised to the third power. The number is communicated as symbol, not as by analysis.”10  It is also important to know that the repetition of some thing three times was and still is an Eastern way to expresses emphasis. This kind of threefold repetition is seen throughout the Bible and in Eastern literatures as well (cf. Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8). Because six is repeated three times, to make 666, it is to show how complete and perfect his evil ways and ungodliness are.     The Source of the Mark  It is strongly possible that John is getting his concept of the mark from Ezekiel 9: 3b-4 “Then the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side 4 and said to him, "Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it."” Some scholars have also suggested that John may had in mind the Roman coins which bore the images and the names of the emperors (see attachment #2) used to buy and sell commodities or the imperial seals then in use. “This has a parallel in the Jewish prohibition of images, which for some, such as the zealots, included the image of the emperor on Roman coins.”11   Since the mark is said to be put on the hand and on the forehead, it is unlikely that John meant the coins. John could have been inspired by many more “marks” prevalent in his time like the Jewish phylacteries12, square leather boxes containing scripture passages  worn on the left hand and forehead” used as a sign of piety for the ultra-pious in the 1st century; (cf. Matthew 23:5). The fact that the mark of the beast is put on the right hand, and not on the right hand, is an obvious discrepancy but it is still possible that the mark was modeled after the phylacteries.   Regarding the imperial seals, Deissmann found evidence in the “papyri for a stamp printed on deeds of sale with the name and year of the reigning emperor….Deissmann observed that the brand embodied the name or number of the beast (v 17), concerning buying and selling”.13 This finding is very significant.   According to Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology, the Greek term, Charagma, mark, was very commonly used for imprints on documents or coins, too. “Charagma is well attested to have been an imperial seal of the Roman Empire used on official documents during the first and second centuries.”14 The only other reference to charagma, in the New Testament (outside Revelation) occurs in Acts 17: 29 where it certainly stands for an image formed by art with design and skill. It is also known that the charagma was a kind of brand used in the Roman era to brand the disobedient or runaway slaves. Their mark always indicated one of ownership very much like brands of cattle today. Tattooing for religious purposes was also widespread. Roman soldiers also willingly bore the name of their most liked General tattooed or branded on them.  It is clear from the context, though, that John did not expect real literal branding or tattooing on his followers. His whole point was to make a spiritual point using a known customary practice to communicate a spiritual point.   A Literal Mark or a Metaphor?  This concept is first used in Exodus 13:9 as a metaphor “ This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.” But if we take literally that the beast will put a literal mark of 666 on the hands and foreheads of his followers (13:16), we will be required by logic and context to admit, too, that believers will have 777, the supposed number of God, or any other good mark on their hands and foreheads (7:3). The point I am driving home is that what is true of one group should be true of the second group for it is written that they will both carry marks (13:16;14:1) on their skins.  However, one plausible explanation of the marks that the groups receive is to say that they are merely spiritual likeness: those who worship God have the spiritual likeness of God and those who worship the beast have the spiritual likeness of the beast. This way of understanding the marks seems the most faithful to John’s rendering of the marks.     As Augustine said, “The mark in the right hand and forehead implies the prostration of bodily and intellectual powers to the beast's domination. "In the forehead by way of profession; in the hand with respect to work and service.”15 This is another way to make sense of the mark and literalism fails its proponents miserably.   The beast with the ten horns and the seven heads, the leopard-bear-lion unit will also need to be taken literally by the “literalists.” Therefore, the truth is that neither the “dinosaur” horns nor the marks are literal but metaphors. There will not be a need to write literal writings on people but their deeds will spell out, loud and clear, where each one’s allegiance is.  Those who refuse to bow down to the beast by aligning themselves with God will be denied the basic necessities of life like food, shelter and clothing—a kind of trade sanction. The whole earthly system will count against them, but they will win at the end of the day.   The truth of the matter is that there are countless beasts that came and went since John wrote his Revelation. Everyone who “sits for the portrait of the beast” qualifies as one. There will certainly be more beasts to come—I do not know how many but the obsession with one, single, specific beast coming at the end of the age with a literal 666 mark on him should be discarded. Also, as words need to be translated, symbols, too, need to be translated—including the symbol of the beast, the much dreaded mark.     The Violated Book  This book is very well known and for the wrong reasons usually. Though it is the last book of the sixty-six books of the Bible, it happens to be the first book many people read. It is certain that someone who has not read yet the first sixty-five books of the Bible has nothing to do with this book as it doesn’t offer anything significant that is new.  The problem often starts when people assume the book to be a guideline about what is to happen in the future—a kind of a key for the unknown. Such people think that Jesus gave John a detailed future plan from the beginning of the world to the end. They also believe that the book details how the world will end and when it will end, too!  Many people believe that the Revelation of John foretold the 1st and the 2nd World Wars, the invention of the atomic bomb, the rise of USSR and even its ref flag, the rebirth of the State of Israel, and the ongoing Middle East conflict. No wonder then that this book is used by non-Christians like new Age groups and many fortunetellers to manipulate and confuse the naïve.   Many of these people went far enough as to set a time when the world will end using Revelation! Others established small and dangerous cults and armed themselves to the teeth to fight the beast they claimed was represented by the United States. The Davidic cult of Waco, TX, best illustrates this. Needless to say, all these people missed the mark miserably.       Martin Luther despised Revelation as a Christian book very much like James (which he called “an epistle of straw”) and John Calvin wrote commentaries on the 66 books of the Bible save Revelation! The way the NT was finally put together also speaks volumes. Though Revelation was not the last book written (2nd Peter is), it finds itself at the end of the NT—this is not an accident.        The message of the book, however, should be clear—it is that God wins and triumphs over evil. For this book to be helpful to Christians, its writer should not be seen as a kind of omniscient secretary of God who knew the future. It is compatible with our faith to accept that the writer did not know the future but merely had a strong conviction that God will not abandon his servants in the face of deadly threats and that evil will finally be defeated.                It is true that the whole book of Revelation is abused but chapter 13 is certainly the most vandalized. It is sad that many people who do not take the Bible  seriously and live a life without Christ take the mark of the beast literally and sometimes become fanatics! What is so different with this number? It is as though Jesus said “all the Law and the Prophets hang on that number—666!”       Many Christians have been offended by this very exploitation of chapter 13, especially verses 16-18. This passage was used as a basis for occult practices, science fiction movies, propaganda against the European Union (EU) and the Uniform Product Code (UPC). Others have claimed credit cards and social security numbers are the mark of the beast. No wonder that many Christians do not read Revelation let alone reading chapter 13 alone for their private devotions or public worship. It is as though Revelation became a spiritual liability.         However, this is not to ignore that many people (maybe, out of curiosity) indeed want to receive the mark of the beast! One may wonder why but the beast and his distinct mark—666 became exotic and cool for many spiritually blind people who think the beast as a joke or a fabulous thing to be sought after! Here is one practical research that could shock the sensible:  “A very informative "Mark of the Beast" "spoof" was recently staged on the Internet by Bill Cross. Bill wanted to try his hand at setting up a website. Bill decided for his first project, "a spoof website of a company peddling the mark of the beast". So Global Monetary was created with the advertising "Become an IDchip member and Receive $250!". Not wanting to cause real panic, Bill admittedly laced the site, "with enough clues so that anyone who scrutinized it would know it wasn't for real and would therefore not panic." Bill was surprised, "On the first full day of operation the site had more that 4,200 distinct user sessions averaging 6 minutes each". Emails began pouring in from hysterical Christians, privacy enthusiasts, the media world requesting interviews, and many who recognized it was simply a "joke".  Realizing things were getting "out of hand", after just four days, Bill "pulled the plug" on Global Monetary.   Bill also made this "alarming" statement, "I realized that I was getting another kind of visitor to the site: People who actually wanted to receive the mark of the beast just to get in on the IPO. I was totally blind-sided by that. I never expected that to happen. . ."16  How could one explain this unfortunate finding? The only explanation I know is that, out of ignorance, many people are playing with fire and they need serious help. It is time for the church to step up and save the naïve.  Many of these people are fascinated by the “power” of the beast and their subtle dualism kicks in and that is why they give too much attention to the beast and admiration for his miracles. They are like the ones who shout “”Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him” (13:4). I must be quick to mention that the beast has no power other than that he was temporarily given by God. John did not leave this unsaid; he says that the beast, like his lieutenant, is out there just to deceive. The beast’s lieutenant, certainly another beast, (13:11) “has two horns like a lamb”, John writes. A horn was supposed to show authority, strength and power. It is the rule of the jungle that animals with horns, tusks, and fang-like teeth best survive in the bush where only the fittest survive. But what about the little stubby non-fatal lamb horns the beast has? They are fake! The beast wants to pretend that he has real power and authority to bully the inhabitants of the earth but he doesn’t—his power is artificial and his horns are not horns. This alone should quench the idolatrous passion many people have for the beast and his demons for they are weak creatures that are not in match with the Creator.        Epilogue  Regarding the mark, it should not be taken literally as I illustrated above. This is what consistence requires. Furthermore, it is true that theories on this issue change allot faster than I can mention. The only unchanging and reliable thing to do is to remain true to Revelation itself. John shares some important specifics about the mark:  ·	No one is exempted from  receiving the mark (13:16). This is a worldwide campaign, everyone will get the mark. No class of people or age group is exempted.    ·	The mark and worshiping the beast are inseparable twosome (14:9; 14:11; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4). Five out of the seven times the mark is mentioned, it is directly tied to worshipping the beast. No one will get the mark by mistake or accidentally. One has to worship the beast to get it.   ·	The beast owns this mark (16:2; 19:20). This mark is the beast’s and it stands in contrast with God’s mark. The mark of the beast is bogus mark fashioned after God’s. God’s mark is for protection—even for disobedient  sinners like Cain: “13 Cain said to the LORD , "My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."  15 But the LORD said to him, "Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.” Genesis 4. Ezekiel 9 also says: “4 and said to him [the Lord], "Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it." 5 As I listened, he said to the others, "Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 6 Slaughter old men, young men and maidens, women and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.” This is the mark of God giving life but the forged mark of the beast takes life and takes it painfully.   ·	It is either the name of beast or the number of his name (13:17). Though whether the mark is literal or metaphor is debated, one thing is certain—people will get it. Whether people choose to get the number or the name, it is all the same at the end of the day—it is probably only a matter of style and fashion but they all lead to death, a painful one. Christians should avoid adding up numbers in order to identify the beast for once the beast comes he will not be able to hide. There is nothing magic with the number  666 for it is found other places in the Bible (1Kings 10; and 2Chronicles 9).   I have never heard of anyone identifying King Solomon with the beast (anti-Christ) though Solomon was most noted for, among others, his great wisdom, his introduction of idolatry to Israel  and for rebuilding the Temple. It is precisely these three things, among others, that the beast will also do. Sooner or later, if the madness of playing with numbers continues unchecked, a liar will open his mouth and say that Solomon was the beast.  ·	No one can sell or buy without the mark (13:17). An economic boycott, and starvation therefore, awaits those who reject worshiping the beast. Because of the beast’s one world order, there will not be a hiding place. Those who do not accept the mark will indeed be killed. The function of the mark is therefore to allow one to buy and sell as it is also a symbol of allegiance.     ·	Anyone who receives the mark will not be saved (14:9-11) The matter of worshipping the beast is one of personal decision. Whoever decides to worship him denies himself or herself of salvation.  Revelation 14 says “...If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, 10he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 11And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name."  May we be the ones who worship the Lord alone and shun the beast, the master deceiver.     Source:   BLib 9176           Endnote  1.	1. Gary D.

       Prologue    A. Incarnation  “The doctrine of the incarnation is that the eternal Son of God…became human, and that He did so without in any manner or degree diminishing His divine nature.” (Bryant 242: 1967). It is clear in the Holy Bible that God wants to have a personal relationship with people. The Book of Genesis illustrates how God fellowshipped with the first couple he created until sin separated them from him. After thousands of years of utter confusion, human kind was fortunate enough to see God, in the person of Christ, breaking into history. No amount of prophets or written codes could bridge the gap sin created between God and the people he created. This is actually what, in part, necessitated  the incarnation of Christ. God with all his wisdom found the incarnation to be the best way to redeem humankind.  The word “incarnation”, like many other theological terms, is not found in the Bible though the concept it denotes is. This term describes the historical step God took to take a human flesh (John 1:1,14). The annunciation describes how the angel Gabriel appeared to the virgin Mary two thousand years ago to announce to her the Son she will supernaturally conceive and his role and identity in history (Matthew 1: 16, 1:18; Luke 1:35). This marvelous Son was also called equal with God (John 10:30). Though God took human blood and flesh (Hebrews 2:14), he was yet sinless (Hebrews 4:15). Needless to say, the best way to describe the incarnated God is to call him “God-man” for he was both divine and human, and according to our church Fathers, he had two natures—humanity and divine.    B. Atonement  The word “atonement” means “satisfactory reparation for an offence or injury; that which produces reconciliation (Exod. 30:16). In the Bible it means the  covering of man’s sins through the shedding of blood, in the OT, the blood of sacrificed animals, in the NT, the blood of man’s Redeemer, Jesus Christ.” (Bryant 63: 1967). As apostle Paul writes  “God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not reckoning their sins to them, and placing in us the word  of reconciliation.” (2 Corinthians 5:19). The apostle also writes again “For it seemed good that all fullness should dwell in him, and that through him all things, whether those on earth  or those in heaven, should be reconciled into him  when he made peace through the blood of his cross” (Colossians 1:19-20). The Nicene Creed also affirms this doctrine.  Like the doctrine of the incarnation, the Fathers and the great theologians of the church developed the doctrine of the atonement from its “primitive” stage to this “sophisticated” level. The development and the sophistication of this doctrine did not come as a result of fighting heresies as is true of other major doctrines (like Christology, Pneumatology, and Theology Proper, to name  a few) but it came as a result of human curiosity caused by the apparent mystery of this doctrine. The apostolic preaching obviously taught that Christ died an atoning death but did not develop further what that really meant. It took the pious speculations of the church Fathers and her theologians to pool their brains to make this great mystery more understandable to people. These brilliant sons of the church had “to inquire into the state of fallen man [i.e., people], and to ask how Christ accomplished  His work of Redemption….That work is reversal of the Fall , the blotting out of sin, the deliverance from bondage, the reconciliation of mankind with God. And it is brought to pass by the Incarnation, by the life, the sufferings, and the death of the Divine redeemer. All this may be summed up in the word Atonement.” (Doctrine of the Atonement: Catholic Encyclopedia-on line).     How the  Incarnation and the  Atonement Are Related:    A. Examining the issue  Needless to say, the incarnation and the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ cannot be separated for academic purposes. The Son took the incarnation for the simple purpose of atoning. Therefore, both the incarnation and the atonement of the Son (Christ) belong to his saving functions which include his revelatory role (Matthew 13:57, 21:11, 46), his rule (Hebrew 1:8; Matthew 13:41, 19:28),  reconciling work (John 17; Luke 22:31; Romans 8:33-34), which all went through different stages like his humiliation (Matthew 26:57-27:1-44), incarnation (John 1:14; Philippians 2:6-7; Galatians 4:4), death (Matthew 27::45-50), and his descent into Hades (Ephesians 4:8-10; 1 Timothy 3:16; 1 Peter 3:18-19). The Apostles Creed also has a reference to the incarnation and the atonement. All these stages climaxed in his exaltation of resurrection (Matthew 28: 5-7), ascension (Luke 24:50-51; Acts 1:6-11), his sitting of the right hand of God (Acts 2:33-36, 5:31; Ephesians 1:20-22; Hebrews 10:12), and his parousia (Matthew 25: 31). As Erickson writes “The one who came in lowliness, humility, and even humiliation, will return in complete exaltation. Then indeed, every knee will bow and every tongue confess  that Jesus Christ is Lord (Phil. 2:10-11)” (Erickson 779:1985).    As I indicated earlier, the incarnation and the atonement cannot be divorced from each other. God deemed essential that his Son should atone for the sins of humankind. For this to be possible, the Son of God became incarnated in order to accomplish his mission. Could not God find another way to redeem the human race? I believe that it is safe to answer “no” for God would not have hesitated had he known a better way to have this job done. Some people see the incarnation as a mark against the honor and the dignity of God. They often ask “how could God become man?” ironically enough, God satisfied his honor and dignity by becoming a man. Because of the historic incarnation, it is anymore impossible to see God as cold and aloof deistic creator. God showed his love and concern for the  human being by becoming one of them; and not only that but also dying for them an atoning death for the forgiveness of their sins.   B. Prophesies concerning the Incarnation and the atonement  There are many prophesies about the sufferings and the atoning death of Christ in the OT.  Psalm 22 which is one of the most quoted Psalms in the NT is typico-prophetically Messianic; its first verse begins with “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me” which is one of the most well known verses in the entire Bible since Jesus lamented it on the cross (Matthew 27:46-NIV). In this Psalm, “David describes his struggle with death in language that is also appropriate to the suffering Messiah. Verses 14-16 prophetically describe  crucifixion, a means of execution not known until Roman times: the pain, the extreme thirst, asphyxiation, and agony to the hands and feet” (The Ryrie Study Bible-NIV 740:1986).  Indeed, the entire Psalm predicts the sufferings and the atoning death of the Lord Jesus Christ. Psalm 16 is another significant Psalm in this connection; verses 8-10 were cited by apostle Peter in Acts 2: 25-28, 31; verse 10 was cited by apostle Paul in Acts 13:35. Though these verses primarily reflect the Psalmist’s own experience, they find their ultimate fulfillings in the Messiah.       Jesus virgin conception was predicted long before he was born of the virgin Mary (Isaiah 7:14). Genesis 3: 15 is also about how the Messiah will save his people from the consequences of their sins and the deceptions of the tempter. Zechariah 9: 9 is a great prophesy  fulfilled at the first advent of Jesus Christ (Matthew 21:4-5). Psalm 8:5 is also applied to Jesus (Hebrews 2:6-8). Isaiah 42:1, according to Matthew 12:18-20, describes about the Messiah who will bring peace and justice to the entire world. Isaiah again talks about the atoning death of Christ saying that even his soul was involved in the offering. Psalm 110: 4 says that, like Melchizedek, Christ combines the offices of priesthood and kingship as well as confirmed by Hebrews 7:21. As we have seen above, the incarnation and the atonement are interdependent  and they  cannot be separated for academic exercise.    C. Incarnation Without Atonement?  God did not send his incarnated Son for sports. According to the Bible, the incarnation presupposes the atoning death of the Son. However, as I will explain below in details, one cannot have one without the other. As God is Spirit (John 4:24), it is impossible for him to die since death involves separating the soul and the material body. Therefore, God had to be incarnated to truly die on the cross. As Hebblethwaite put it “Only if we can say that God has himself, on the cross, ‘borne our sorrows’ can we find him universally present ‘in’ the suffering of others. It is not a question of ‘awareness’ and ‘sympathy’. It is, as Whitehead put it, a matter of the ‘fellow-sufferer who understands’. This whole dimension of the Christian doctrine of the incarnation, its recognition of the costly nature of God’s forgiving love, and its perception that only a suffering God is morally credible, is lost if God’s involvement is reduced to a matter of ‘awareness’ and ‘sympathy’.” (Cited in White 40:1991). As Hebblethwaite indicates, an unincarnated God is good for nothing!  The incarnation of God attracted much opposition throughout history. Unbelievers were always perplexed by why God would contaminate himself by taking a human flesh and dying a disgraceful life. Their Platonic thinking stands unveiled! One of the most challenging oppositions against the incarnation comes from Robinson who wrote “No-one can just become a man out of the blue; a genuine man (as opposed to a replica) can only come out of the process, not into it…The fact that I, a human being, might decide to experience life as a dog—and to know nothing, even of my fellow men, except through the limitations of a canine nervous system—does not make me a dog.” (Cited in White 71:ibid). Despite the rationality of Robinson’s argument, it falls short of the wisdom of God that is not a surprise! God did not decide to become a man out of the blue contrary to what Robinson alludes to—it has been God’s plan from time immemorable to send his Son incarnated in order to die an atoning death for the benefit of the human race which then did not exist.   D. Atonement Without Incarnation? The only way the atonement was possible was through the incarnation of the Son of God. In fact, the apostolic teaching confirms that the purpose of the incarnation was simply an atoning redemptive purpose—period. The writer of the Hebrews confirms this “Therefore, since the children have a common share in flesh and blood, he also in like manner shared these with them , so that through death  he might destroy him who had dominion over death, that is, the devil.” (Hebrews 2:14).  Smeaton, the prominent 19th century scholar, affirms that the incarnation was necessitated by the atonement when he wrote “To assign a  different intention to the incarnation, is not only to be wise above what is written, but well-nigh a contradiction to the explicit statement  of what is set forth as the only design known to the apostles” (Smeaton 12:1988). As Smeaton highlighted, there could not have been an atonement without incarnation and the incarnation took place to pave the way for the atonement.   It is biblically well established that the atonement and the incarnation are not a menu where one can pick and choose but a unified package that is to be accepted whole sale. In fact, all the apostles saw a great significance in the mode of Christ’s death on the cross, a significance more starling had he died an ordinary peaceful death in his bed—if he had one to begin with! “Foxes have lairs, and the birds of heaven, nests, but the Son of man has no place to lay his head.” (Luke 9:59). Jesus obviously knew what kind of death he would die and looked forward to it “He said this signifying by what kind of death he was about to die” (John 12:33). Apostle Peter also spoke about the atoning death of Christ which came through his death as the incarnated Son of God (1 Peter 2:24). Apostle Paul was not also silent about this (Galatians 6:14). Therefore, the apostolic tradition bears witness to the unity and the interdependence of the incarnation and the atonement.   Epilogue   As we have seen above, the atonement is founded on the divine incarnation that resulted the Jesus we know today in order to become a mediator between God and humankind. As a result of the incarnation and the atonement, the fallen humanity was redeemed and restored. The book of Revelation writes “Worthy are you to receive the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and by means of your blood you have bought for God people from every tribe and language and people and nation.” (Revelation 4:9b). The death of an innocent God-man was brought by the sin that incurred the anger of the just God who could not watch the entire human race engulfed by sin. It was necessary that a divine love and justice be served for the satisfaction of God and for the redemption of the human race.   God’s only Son, who is equally divine and one with the Father, became incarnated and wooed and won (and is still winning) many to their loving and caring Father. The incarnation of God is not something new or plan “B” that came out of the blue but it is a plan  devised by God almighty before foundation of the world was laid (Ephesians 1:3-4; 1 Peter 1:20). The Messianic prophesies cited above support this claim. Obviously Jesus was not an ordinary man; he was God-man (i.e., complete God), conceived through the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, he is the Savior of the humankind and no one who believes in him will ever perish (John 3:16). Therefore, the relationship between the incarnation and the atonement is one that was defined by God himself when he planned a time immemorable that he will send his incarnated Son to die an atoning death on the cross. “Let God be true, and every human being a liar” (Romans 3:4c).

                                                                                        Introduction  Nestorianism taught the full humanity and the full divinity of Christ. Bishop Nestorius labeled the humanity and the divinity as persons (prosopon) and taught that the two persons of Christ were joined by will without communication idiomatum (communication of attributes). 1 Abbot Eutyches  who was a well known monk who lived in Constantinople subscribed to this teaching later called Monophysites from their belief that the pre-incarnated Logos had only one nature but got a second one in its post incarnation status.    Nestorianism was condemned in the Third Ecumenical Council in Ephasus and  was deposed as bishop of Constantinople. Abbot Eutyches was also condemned  in the Fourth Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon.   Cyril: The Chalcedon Ring Leader  Saint Cyril of Alexandria’s Christological formulation was accepted as orthodox at the expense of the one formulated by Abbot Eutyches and Bishop Nestorius. A letter to Nestorius, St. Cyril wrote, in defense of his Christological position, “Thus we will confess on one Christ and Lord, not that we worship a man together with the Word in order that an appearance of division may not be introduced by saying with.”2  In an apparent exaggeration to embarrass his adversaries, St. Cyril continued to say “Therefore, the one Lord Jesus Christ is not to be divided into two sons”3! Needless to say, neither Abbot Eutyches nor Bishop Nestorius ever spoke about two sons in the Lord of Jesus Christ! The Coptic and the Syrian churches lashed out at the Chalcedonian Christology of what later became the Byzantine churches.    St. Cyril and his friends, including the Pope Celestine I, seemed not to interest in Scriptural debate about the issue at hand. They merely saw themselves as the protectors of the apostolic faith. A letter from Pope Celestine I to St. Cyril indicates this “It is necessary both to understand clearly and to remember that one must flee rather than seek foolish questions which do not promote the health of souls but proceed to their destruction.”4  But Saint Cyril occasionally exegetes the Scripture to support his position.  On page 83 of the same book, he outlines his understanding of  Philippians 2:7-8 in support of his two nature Christological position, he writes “We say that the flesh was neither turned into the nature of the divinity, nor, indeed, that the ineffable nature of the Word of God was altered into the nature of the flesh, for he is immutable and absolutely unchangeable, always being the same, according to the Scriptures.”5    The Chalcedonian Confusion  Chalcedon did great harm to the church as the schism it caused still persists. The  orthodoxy of the augmentation of the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed is also questionable in the light of the NT. This augmentation forces one to categorize the activities of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, to fit in one of his natures—either the divine or the human. The NT account of Jesus contradicts such dichotomy. In the whole NT, no where is Jesus shown to possess all the divine attributes (like omniscience, omnipresence) that the Chalcedonian augmentation attributes to the  earthly Jesus.6  For example, Jesus confesses his ignorance about the parousia “ No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” Matthew 24:36. How then can we take the Chalcedonian statement face value that attributes to him all the-time-omniscience?  One may be tempted to say that Jesus is here speaking from the perspective of his human nature; problem number one, there is nothing in the text to indicate that; problem number two, to say so is to affirm Nestorius’ schizophernic Jesus with two separate natures, persons, wills—each one independent from the other. Nothing is closer to the truth than to admit that the earthly Jesus was not omniscient. Jesus’ deficient omniscience is also seen in Luke’s description of the Child Jesus “And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men.” Luke 2:52. To say that Jesus grew in wisdom, for example, is to say that he lacked it in full measure in the first place for one cannot grow in something he already had in full measure.   The Kenosis and the Chalcedon  The Kenosis passage (Philippians 2:5-7) is one of the most polished and most beautiful passages of all of the Pauline epistles—if not the entire NT. The proper question in this connection is, of what did Jesus empty himself? The earthly Jesus temporarily and willfully emptied himself some of the divine attributes of his pre-incarnation deity.  The Kenotic interpretation should never be seen as an unbiblical compromise to the immutability of God. However, the incarnation itself necessitates some form of divine mutability on the part of God in a way that best suites him.   As one writer put it, “The Kenotic theory is often opposed on the grounds that it necessitates a change in the being of God. It is said that to assert that Jesus gave up any of the divine attributes is to deny the immutability of God. But if it is true that God is immutable in an absolute sense then there cannot be incarnation. But the Scripture reveals that God became man, that he moved from one state of being into another state of being—‘that the Word became flesh.’ The Word was not always fresh; it became that which it was not. In the incarnation the Logos , the divine Son of God, was changed from an eternal state of being as co-equal with the Father to a state of being in time and space in which he took the lowly state of man. In this state, Jesus became ‘less than the Father”7 (cf. John 14:28)  The Coptic churches do not call them selves Monophysites but non-Chalcedonian. Their Christology regarding the nature (s) of Christ is very sophisticated and hard to nail down.  “The Oriental Orthodox churches affirm one united Divine-Human nature, will and energy in the same Christ without confusion, without change, without division and without separation from the very moment of His descent to the Virgin’s womb where He took to Himself from her a human body with a human rational soul and made Himself  one with the manhood which He took from her as formulated by Cyril with such words One Incarnate nature of God the Word.”8  The Eastern Orthodox Churches affirm a Christology slightly different from that of the Oriental. The Easterners affirm “Two natures [,] two will and two energies hypostatically united in the one Lord Jesus Christ.”9   Conclusion  The way Chalcedon handled the relationship between the divine and the human nature of Jesus was nothing less than a disaster. The Chalcedon statement (the augmentation of the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed) may have come out of good heart in an attempt to safe guard the apostolic orthodox faith but it did not succeed well enough as the church is still divided and the its orthodoxy is highly questionable. Further more, the Fathers could not avoid using some Hellenistic Greek terminologies which did not have biblical background, for example, “Theotokos,” hypostasis,” and “ousia.”    This Chalcedonian statement highlighted the Oneness of the Person of the incarnated Son of God as underlined by the repeated use of the word the “same.” This Alexandrian background lends lenience to the Antiochenes by its use of “coalescing” to explain the union of two natures. It is sad though that this Council which brought together Western and Eastern traditions also marked the first visible division of the Church as the Alexandrians (Orthodox) churches do not recognize it to this day.

       The Price of the Apostolic Ministry    Author: Paul Date: AD 47    Occasion:  After Paul wrote I Corinthians to address the difficult issues the Corinth church had and to correct the disorders in the church that had been reported to him (II Corinthians 2:1; 12:4; 13:1-2), the difficulties in the church got out of hand. Other missionaries, enemies of Paul and his teachings, had arrived in the city and made a serious attack against Paul. They persuaded many Christians to desert Paul’s leadership. Paul, still in Ephesus wrote to the church a severe and sorrowful letter (2:4) which has been lost to us. Paul wrote II Corinthians from Macedonia and followed it up with his final recorded visit to the church (Acts 20:1-4).   Purpose:  This letter shows a threefold purpose: 1. To express joy and satisfaction in the way this church supported Paul’s ministry (1-7). 2. To remind the believers of their commitment to the offering for the believers in Judea (8-9) 3.

        How Far is the Chalcedonian Symbol True to the Christology of the New Testament?      Prologue  Before the Nestorian heresy of splitting the Divine and the human nature of Christ was finally put to a complete rest, exactly the opposite heresy emerged! Since Nestorius heresy taught a type of schizophrenic personality of Christ, his opponents went to the other extreme by teaching that the Divine nature of Christ absorbed the human, as a result they claimed, Christ had only one nature. This meant that Christ did not only have one personality but also one nature.   Their claim was that the incarnation laid to rest any attempt of dividing the personalities or the natures of Christ. The main proponents of this view included Dioscurus, Patriarch of Alexandria, and Eutyches, an archimandrite of a monastery outside Constantinople. The proponents claimed that the great Alexandrine teacher, St. Cyril, taught their Monophysitic doctrine. This was an apparent misinterpretation of the icon’s views of the Person of Jesus Christ. Because of this heresy, Eutyches was excommunicated in November 431 at the synod of Constantinople. Eutyches was reinstated in August 449 at the council of Ephesus presided by the Alexandrine patriarch when his heresy was found orthodox!   The Augmentation of the Nicaeno-Contantinopolitan Creed  The Fathers at Chalcedon quoted the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed and augmented it with this statement to combat the Menophysites: “In agreement, therefore, with the holy fathers, we all unanimously teach that we should confess that our Lord Christ is one and the same Son. The same perfect in Godhead and the same perfect in manhood, truly God and truly man, the same of a rational soul and body, consubstantial with us in manhood, like us in all things except sin; begotten from the Father before the ages as regards His Godhead, and in the last days, the same, because of us and because of our salvation begotten from the Virgin Mary, Theotokos, as regards His manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten, made known in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation, the difference of the natures being by no means removed because of the union, but the property of each nature being preserved and coalescing in one prosopon and one hypostasis—not parted or divided into two prosopa, but one and the same Son, only-begotten, divine Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the prophets of old and Jesus Christ Himself have taught us about Him and the creed of our fathers has handed down."   Examining the Orthodoxy of the Chalcedonian Augmentation  I believe that the Fathers at Chalcedon (451) did all they could to fight heresies and to remain orthodox at the same time. This was by no means easy as their augmentation to the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed bears witness. Their statement reminds me the Somali saying: “You cannot fear God and fight your enemies as well!” The implication being that you can never fight fair; to the Somalis, it is like having your cake and eating it which I wish were possible! A major problem is that the Christological teachings of the NT does not wholly fit into the Chalcedonian statement; this statement forces one to categorize the activities of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, to fit in one of his natures—either the divine or the human.   The NT account of Jesus contradicts such a dichotomy. In the whole NT, no where is Jesus shown to possess all the divine attributes (like omni-presence) that the Chalcedonian statement attributes to the earthly Jesus. For example, Jesus confesses his ignorance about the parousia: “No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” Matthew 24:36. Here Jesus himself confesses in the simplest and the clearest language humanly possible that he does not know the specific hour or even day of his parousia; how then can we take the Chalcedonian statement face value that attributes to him all the-time-omniscience?   One may be tempted to say that Jesus is here speaking from the perspective of his human nature; problem number one, there is nothing in the text to indicate that; problem number two, to say so is to affirm Nestorius’ schizophrenic Jesus with two separate natures, persons, wills—each one independent from the other. Nothing is closer to the truth than to admit that Jesus as incarnate Son was not omniscient. Jesus’ deficient omniscience is also seen in Luke’s description of the child Jesus: “And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.” Luke 2:52. To say that Jesus grew in wisdom, for example, is to say that he lacked it in full measure in the first place for one cannot grow in something he already had in full measure.   Certainly the incarnate Jesus did not have all the attributes of deity in his earthly days otherwise he would not have needed to grow in wisdom and in favor with God. Again, one may be tempted to say that Luke is talking about the humanity of Jesus but that is again risking the Nestorian heresy of the schizophrenic Jesus. Interestingly enough, that the incarnate Son possessed less than the full attributes of deity is confirmed by Jesus himself when he says: “ The Father is greater than I” John 14:28. Here, Jesus’ confession must not be underestimated or twisted to “protect” his deity. The incarnate Son of God who is the second person of the Holy Trinity is speaking here. Needless to say, Jesus’ deity is confirmed throughout the NT explicitly and implicitly as well.    The Kenosis and Chalcedon  The Kenosis passage is one of the most polished and the most beautiful passages of all of the Pauline epistles—if not the entire NT. It is this splendid passage that turns great theologians on each other. Apostle Paul writes: “Have this way of thinking among you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being from the beginning in the form of God, did not regard being equal with God, something to be grasped. But he emptied himself taking on the form of a bondsman, coming in the likeness of people. And being found in the appearance of a man.” Philippians 2:5-7 (African Bible). The proper question in this connection is, of what did Jesus empty himself? The earthly Jesus (the incarnated Son) temporarily and willfully emptied himself some of the divine attributes of his pre-incarnation deity.   While I admit that we cannot build a (major) doctrine on a single passage, this Kenotic passage finds harmony throughout the Bible. The Kenotic interpretation should never be seen as an unbiblical compromise to the immutability of God. However, it is the incarnation itself that necessitates some form of divine mutability on the part of God in a way that best suites him.   As one writer put it: “The Kenotic theory is often opposed on the grounds that it necessitates a change in the being of God. It is said that to assert that Jesus gave up any of the divine attributes is to deny the immutability of God. But if it is true that God is immutable in an absolute sense then there cannot be incarnation. But the Scripture reveals that God became man, that he moved from one state of being into another state of being—‘that the Word became flesh.’ The Word was not always flesh; it became that which it was not. In the incarnation the Logos, the divine Son of God, was changed from an eternal state of being as co-equal with the Father to a state of being in time and space in which he took the lowly state of man. In this state Jesus became ‘less than the Father.’” John 14:28. (Evangelical Theological Society Papers 1987:3).   One of the great theologians who fell prey to the “protection” of the immutability of God is Charles Ryrie who wrote: “The kenosis (emptying) of Christ during His incarnation does not mean that He surrendered any attributes of deity, but that he took on the limitations of humanity. This involved a veiling of His preincarnate glory (John 17:5) and the voluntary waiving of some of His divine prerogatives during the time He was on earth (Matt.24:36).” (The Ryrie Study Bible, NIV, commentary on Philippians 2:7 1986:1625).   One wonders why the eminent theologian chose to contradict himself—he must have drunk from the well of Chalcedon! If he first stated that the Kenosis of Christ during his incarnation does not mean that he surrendered any of his deity, why did he conclude what is exactly the opposite of his first premise by asserting that Christ voluntarily waived of some of his prerogatives during the time he was on earth? This is where one can end up if he buys the Chalcedon theory whole sale without examining its contents in the light of the Bible.   Counting on the Kenosis in the Light of Chalcedon   Despite the shortcomings of Chalcedon, it can be used as a flexible framework for our understanding of the true nature of the incarnated Son, Jesus Christ. The mutability of God that the Kenosis poses should not be seen a danger to the essence of God.   As one writer best jots down: “It need not be thought that the assertion of the mutability of the Son implies any change in the divine essence. The essence or the ousia (to use a Chalcedonian term) of God does not change. The ousia of the Son is the ousia of the Father. It is the equation of attributes with the ousia of God that is in question here…We must be aware that when we speak of God as the incarnate One, we are speaking of God in an abnormal category. God’s being in the form of man is not the primary state of God’s being. While God is in essence immutable, we see from Scripture that in His incarnation he subjected Himself to the estate of man which demands change. We must be careful to understand immutability as an unchangeableness of essence, not of state or form.” (Evangelical Theological Society Papers 1987:4).   The above cited quote is a solid and sound, balanced exegete of the Kenotic passage is the only interpretation that does justice to the Pauline passage and the incarnated divine Logos as well. To deny the mutability of the Logos is nothing short of docetism of which some accuse of the Chalcedonian statement.   The Terminology of Chalcedon  The Fathers were handling a very sensitive topic which resembled an unfriendly and uncharted sea—they have my sympathy in this regard. One problem that the Fathers could not obviously avoid was the use of Hellenistic Greek terminologies which did not have biblical background, for example, Theotokos, hypostasis and ousia. To also say the Son was “begotten from the Father before the ages as regards his Godhead” implies a time before the ages when the Son was not begotten. This is, at the best, a mild form of economic Trinity; it does not say in black and white that the Father and the Son were always one without hinting a period of time when they were not so—no matter when, that is before ages or time immemorable. The issue here is safeguarding the Oneness of God—but not at the expense of the Holy Trinity; the result is then Trinitarian Monotheism.   The two natures of Christ is implied in the NT but not explicitly taught. On the contrary, the Chalcedonian statement overly emphasizes the two natures of Christ. In fact the Son of God, or the Son of Man as Jesus called himself repeatedly, seems more human than divine during his earthly days though this by no means means that he was not divine; it is just scriptural emphasis. The Fathers said: “…one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, made known in two natures without confusion, without change, without division, without separation….” But to be honest, there is hardly anything that is more confusing, more changing, more dividing [divisive] and more separating than their statement though they state exactly the opposite. Put more simply, the Fathers seem to have somewhat compromised the humanity of the earthly Jesus.   The Gaps Bridged and the Ones Created  The Chalcedonian Statement should be seen as an augmentation or foot note to the Nicene Creed because what it is precisely trying to do is to define or explain that historic Council. However, whether it succeeded this attempt or not is an open question. This Chalcedonian statement highlighted the Oneness of the Person of the incarnated Son of God as underlined by the repeated use of same. This Alexandrian background lends lenience to the Antiochenes by its use of coalescing to explain the union of the two natures. It is sad though that this great Council which brought together Western and Eastern traditions also marked the first visible division of the physical Church as the Alexandrians (Orthodox churches) do not recognize it to this day.   The NT Christology  The NT Christology, taken face value, is less sophisticated than the Chalcedonian symbol. Regardless of its “primitiveness” and lack of comprehensiveness, it is the most accurate representation of who Jesus was. Like the Chalcedonian symbol, the Christological Hymns raise more questions than they answer. According to the Christological Hymns, Jesus was pre-existent (divine) Being who was incarnated kenotically, who was exalted and resurrected after he suffered an atoning death on the cross, vindicated in the Spirit, preached and believed among nations and taken up in glory (exalted). The NT casts no doubt the deity and the humanity of Jesus—reconciling them did not seem an issue to the writers of the NT. The Chalcedonian Fathers did their best but their statement augmented to the Nicene Creed is not shortcoming free as I indicated above. May God bless the souls of those who preserved for us the undiluted message of our Lord Jesus Christ.    Source:   BLib 1059    Works Cited  1. Evangelical Theological Society Papers.

      “In the next 50 years, we will capture the Western world for Islam. We have the men to do it, we have the money to do it, and above all, we are already doing it.”1 From the speech presented at the dedication of an Islamic Center in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1983.   Facts  1. A typical Muslim thinks Christians are polytheists and perpetual sinners - Misconception of the Trinity  - Materialism, consumerism, etc  2. Islam is not synonymous with terrorism  - Terrorists are a tiny minority among Muslims  - Killing the innocent is un-Islamic (Qur’an 17:33; 25:68) 3. Islam is more than a religion; it is a way of life - It is a community oriented faith - A Muslim’s identity depends on his/her closely knit (extended) family 4. Muslims are sincere and very religious - Muslims seek after God  - Most Muslims would die for their faith  5. It is harder to reach Muslims in the West than in their home countries - Gay “churches”, nominal Christianity  - Muslims consider all Americans as Christians - There are more stumbling blocks here  6. 1.2 billion Muslims (1 out of every 5 people on earth) - Less than 20% of Muslims live in the Middle East - Less than 15% of Muslims are Arabs!  - 156 million Muslims in Indonesia (the largest Muslim concentration) - 300 million Muslims in Southern Asia: Pakistan, India and Bangladesh  - Half of Africa’s people are Muslims (Muslims claim majority) - 12 million Arab Christians in the Middle East  - 7 million Muslims in America2 (2002)   Key Principles   1. Muslims are people and Christ died for them - See Muslims through Christ’s eyes - Christ came to seek and save the lost (Luke 19:10) 2. Debate should not be primary source of sharing - Good news: You can NEVER outdebate a Muslim - We cannot lead people to the Lord by quarrelling with them  - Dialogue with Muslims - Use stories and parables  3. Traditional methods of evangelism are not usually effective  - Generally sharing should be with the same gender - Share in a one-on-one situation   What to do   1. Continue to develop your own relationship with Christ  - Pray for Muslims  - You can only give what you have   2. Use friendships as a way to share your faith  - Many Muslim immigrants in America are lonely - Earn their trust before you share your faith in words - Accept and give hospitality graciously  - Invite Muslims over for a table fellowship at home 3. Use Bible Studies  - OT: Consider chronological Bible studies from Genesis  - Focus on the Pentateuch  - NT: Consider chronological Bible studies from Matthew  - Focus on the Synoptic gospels  4. Focus on common areas  - Build on common grounds - Talk about families and your faith 5. Expect God to work in wonderful ways - Muslims come to Christ! - Have faith, trust the Lord and SHARE YOUR FAITH   “13… "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved." 14How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 15And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"” Romans 10    Source:   BLib 1059    Footnote  1. Ron Peck.

        “Polemic is a sign of religious immaturity”   Christianity and Islam have more similarities than many people realize. In this seminar, we will briefly summarize the similarities and the differences of these two major world religions.  In ministering to Muslims, Christians do not have to throw out the baby with the bathwater and start from scratch. There is a common ground we can build on. In this seminar, we will shun all sorts of caricature and present this subject in a Christlike manner—transparent and honest.   I. God    Ø Both Christianity and Islam teach that there is only ONE true God. Ø Both religions trace their roots to Abraham, a believer in the one true God.  Ø Both believe in the centarality of the believing community—the Church for Christians and the Umma for Muslims—all monotheists.  Ø A point of difference: Muslims think that Christians worship three gods and thus committing shirk, the unforgivable sin in Islam of associating other gods with God. This comes from their misunderstanding of the Trinity which they think means God the Father, God the Son, and God the Mother (Mary). The Qur’an is not silent about this:  “O People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of Allah aught but the truth. Christ Jesus the son of Mary was (no more than) an apostle of Allah, and His Word, which He bestowed on Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Him: so believe in Allah and His apostles. Say not "Trinity" : desist: it will be better for you: for Allah is one Allah. Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is Allah as a Disposer of affairs.” (Qur’an 4:171)  “They do blaspheme who say: Allah is one of three in a Trinity: for there is no god except One Allah. If they desist not from their word (of blasphemy), verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them.” (Qur’an 5:73)   “And behold! Allah will say: "O Jesus the son of Mary! Didst thou say unto men, worship me and my mother as gods in derogation of Allah.?" (Qur’an 5:116)    II. Revelation  Ø Both Christianity and Islam teach that God reveals himself to his people. Both religions have their holy Books—the Bible for Christians and the Qur’an for Muslims.  Ø Muslims believe that the Qur’an is the uncreated pure Word of God dictated to Muhammad by God through Gabriel. Most Christians do not believe that the Bible came as a result of mechanical dictation. Ø The Christian equivalent of the Qur’an is not the Bible but Jesus, the pure uncreated Word of God.   III. Sin and Salvation  Ø Both Islam and Christianity teach the negative consequences of sin and the need for salvation though the term “salvation” is more a technical word for Christian theology. A point of difference à Islam does not teach the Christian doctrine of the “original sin”. The extreme definition of this doctrine as put by the African theologian, Aurelius Augustinus (Augustine of Hippo, AD 354-430 ), is a stumbling block to Muslims. The Calvinist extreme of this doctrine perplexes Muslims, too. In the opinion of many Christian theologians, the Eastern way of understanding this doctrine is the most biblical and most logical as well.    Ø  Augustinian:  In Adam’s fall, we all fell—in Adam’s sin, we all sinned!  Ø  Calvinism:  Total human depravity is the result of Adam’s sin. Humans are not capable of doing anything good and right without the direction intervention of God’s grace!   Eastern:  “No sin that is committed is without its effect. Every sin that you and I commit -- every sin that is ever committed --disrupts the entire cosmos. Your sin has an effect not only on you but on everyone and everything else. Any sin that you and I commit has a reverberation throughout the world, throughout the cosmos. Every puff that you take on your cigarette pollutes the air that everyone else breathes, so to speak. So when the Old Testament claims that the sin of the father will be visited upon the children, it is not issuing a threat; it is simply describing reality. Think about this proposition, and I think you will recognize that it is true. Is it realistic to claim, as Muslims do, that Adam and Eve's sin -- the first of the human race! – had no effects in the world into which all other human beings were born? I do not think so!”1  Ø Muslims believe that all Muslims are saved and the only thing they need to do when they sin is to repent. Muslims do not believe another person can take their place. In Islam, there is no place for the atoning death of Christ.    Source:   BLib 1042      Sources Consulted:   1. http://answering-islam.org.uk/Intro/comparison.html 2. Yusuf Ali (trans).

Best way to witness to Muslims is through friendship   Selected passages from the Qur’an:  "...[T]hose who believe (in the message of Islam), and the Jews, the Sabaeans, and the Christians - all those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and act righteously - no fear shall come upon them..." [5:69]   "Truly, the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." [3:59]  "Behold!' the Angel said, God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the Hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and he shall be of the righteous. She said: "My Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: "Even so; God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, 'Be!' and it is." [3:42-47]  "When thy Lord drew forth from the Children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves, (saying): "Am I not your Lord (who cherishes and sustains you)?"- They said: "Yea! We do testify!" (This), lest ye should say on the Day of Judgment: "Of this we were never mindful": Or lest ye should say: "Our fathers before us may have taken false gods, but we are (their) descendants after them: wilt Thou then destroy us because of the deeds of men who were futile?" (7:172-173).  "I have only created Jinns and men, that they may serve Me." (51:56).   "Abraham was not a Jew nor yet a Christian; but he was true in Faith, and bowed his will to Allah.s (Which is Islam), and he joined not gods with Allah." (3:67).  "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam, never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good") (3:85).

Prologue  Since Christianity became the most widespread religion in the world, Bible translators and local Christians encountered a tedious problem regarding the most appropriate name or names they should use for YHWH who is different from any tribal god under the sun. In the last two centuries, many Western missionaries left their comfort zones and headed for little known overseas tribes to share the Good News with them; theirs was an era of less cultural sensitivity when “Western”, “Christian”, and “civilization” were interchangeable. Most of these well meaning missionaries also took with them their unique cultures and worldviews and forced them on the nationals mistaking them for biblical principles. One example of this is how missionaries of what is know Kenya instructed the local converts to use “Jehovah”, a German corruption of Yahweh, for YHWH. Though the Kalenjin tribe had a word for a supreme Creator, their word was seen unredeemable for Christian use. Decades later, the Kikuyu Christians of Kenya were allowed to use “Ngai”, a Kikiyu word for God, for YHWH. The unfortunate Kalenjin still use “Jehovah” for YHWH.  In this paper, I will examine the words six languages employ for YHWH. One of these words is “Allah” which I will give especial emphasis as it is the primary reason for writing this paper. The other five words will be used as a background for “Allah”.   1. EL:  is a semitic word for God which means the mighty one. The Cananite god, El, was the father of people and also gods whom Baal is one of the most well known. Elohim, the majestic plural form of El, was the common Hebrew name for YHWH. El “was an immoral and debased character. It is a tribute to the high quality of the God of Israel that when the Hebrews took over this name and applied it to Him, it lost all its evil connotations.”1 Elohim occurs in the Old Testament 2570 times and Eloah 57 times 41 of which occur in Job. Simply put, the Hebrews baptized El for YHWH.   2. GOD:  Needless to say, “God” is not a proper name for YHWH but a pagan term applied to him. One of the definitions of Webster’s Third New International Dictionary for “god” (lower case) is “a being of more than human attributes and powers; esp: a super human person....An artificial or natural object (as a carved idol or an animal or tree) that is thought to be seat of divine powers.” This huge 2662 page dictionary also attributes “God” (Uper case) YHWH like attributes but the difference is that of a case. “God” is derived from the Germano-Teutonic “gott” which means “to call, invoke” (Ibid). Saint Anskar (or Ansgar) (801-865), a native of Flanders cut down the oak tree that the Germanics were worshiping referring to it as gott. The devout Germanics told Anskar that their gott, the oak tree, will fall down on him and kill him if he cut it. Saint Anskar, filled with the Holy Spirit cut down what they called gott, and lo! It did not kill him. It is there where saint Anskar preached to the pagan Germanics pointing at the oak tree and told them that what they were worshiping was not gott but a mere tree. He pointed them to heaven and told them that the true Gott has his throne there. It is interesting that saint Anskar did not invent a new word for the people, he simply used their old word, and filled it with Christian meaning. To this day, German Christians worship Gott, not an oak tree though but YHWH!  Some Yahwists suggested that it is possible that the fortune deity, Gad (Hebrew, Gd) of Isaiah 65:11 is related to god; “But you are those who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and who furnish a drink offering for Meni.” (NKJV).    3. EGZIABHER:  This is a classical Ethiopic (Ge’ez) word used for YHWH until today. The first recorded usage of this word is the 4th century when St. Frementius started translating the Bible into Ge’ez. The translation work started by this siant was later completed by the nine saints from Syria who moved to Ethiopia in 480 during the Chalcedonian crisis. It is however, interesting to note the pagan background of the word ”egziabher.” Before this word was claimed for YHWH, the Ethiopic people used to refer it to a sea god they used to worship. In fact the word is composed of two distinct words crudely joined: “egzia” which means “lord” and “bher” which means “sea.” The cult of the lord of the sea used to be popular in the red sea area of what is now Eritrea. Eriteria succeeded from the rest of Ethiopia in 1991. The thirty million Ethiopian Christians, whether orthodox or protestant, use “Egziabher” for YHWH without any difficulty. This is one instance that local Christians redeemed a pagan word for YHWH.    4. WAAQ:  This is a Cushitic sky god widely worshiped in the horn of Africa as late as the 19th century. The Somalis and the Oromos, among other Cushitic tribes, worshipped this sky god before Islam. Waaq was still a powerful deity in the Oromo territory of the present day Ethiopia as late as the 19th century. The waq cult disappeared among the Somalis but is still practiced by many Oromos. The Oromo Bible which was first translated by Onesimos Nesib (1855-1931) using the Amharic script uses “Waaq” for YHWH. The current modern (Latin) Oromo translation also uses “Waaq” for YHWH. However, it will be insane to assume that the Oromo Christians worship a sky god! There is a difference between, and rightly so, when an Oromo Christian uses ” Waaq” and when a pagan Oromo uses the same word for his or her deity.    5. THEOS:  This is a Greek pagan word which simply means “god.” The Greek New Testament uses this very word for Yahweh. Needless to say, apostle Paul used this very word, theos, for YHWH. It is obvious that the NT writers and translators filled a pagan word with Christian meaning. A good example is Paul’s Areopagus Speech where he talks about the unknown god by identifying it with YHWH! “For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.” Acts17:23 (NIV). The Apostle did not coin a new Greek word for YHWH, he simply used an already existing one used for idols! It is therefore interesting to note that though Paul rejected the unbiblical concept infested with the word “theos” he did not disown the word itself but kept it after pouring biblical meaning into it. Paul certainly threw out the bath water but fortunately kept the baby!   6. ALLAH:  Many believe that this name comes from the Aramaic/Syriac word which means “God” or “the God” which is alaha. This school of thought believes that the definite article, final “a”, in the word was dropped off when the word was barrowed into Arabic. Another school of thought teaches that the word “Allah” comes from the Arabic, “al Ilah” which means “the God.” Arab Christians always used “Allah” for YHWH and still continue to refer to him as “Allah.   Needless to say, Muhammad did not coin the word “Allah” and the word itself is pre Islamic in nature. Muhammad’s father was called “Abdallah”, which means the servant of Allah, though he was a pagan from a pagan family. The polytheistic Arabs adopted “Allah” as one of their numerous deities. It was only after the fortieth birthday of Muhammad that the prophet of Islam rehabilitated the word to be used only for the true God whom Muhammad learned from the Jewish and the Christians.  Abd Al-Masih, the famous German writer on Islam, says “Satan met Muhammad, disguised himself using the old Arabic name for God, ‘Allah’ and demanded from him total submission and worship.”2 Abd Al-Masih only accuses Muslims of worshipping “the wrong Allah” (ibid). It is interesting that Abd Al-Masih does not raise any objections against the use of “Allah” for YHWH. He certainly did not want to upset the fifteen million Arab Christians who daily refer to YHWH as “Allah.” Nothing could be unkind than to say that these persecuted but faithful Christians worship a false god. In fact, Fouad Elias Accad, the great Christian scholar from Lebanon, says that “offshoot Christian sects such the Nestorians sent missionaries throughout the Arabia during the sixth and the seventh centuries A.D. During this same time period, there was the appearance of Bedouin seekers after the one true God, truly monotheists, who were called “Hanifs.” These people were the first to use the term Allah for the one God.”3  The late prominent Al Azhar scholar, Dr. Abd al Ati, gives the Muslim understanding of “Allah” in his own words: “Finally, the word Allah in Islam simply but most emphatically means the One and the only Eternal God, Creator of the universe, Lord of all lords, and King of all kings.”4 It is also note worthy that Islam teaches that People of the Book (Jewish, Christians and Muslims) worship the same God! The Qur’an bears witness to this in the most emphatic way possible:  Sura 29:46 "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam)."   Sura 22:40 “Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure.”  Sura 2: 136. “Say ye: ‘We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)."’   Sura 3:3 “It is He [Allah] Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).  Sura 21:22 “If there were, in the heavens and the earth, other gods besides Allah, there would have been confusion in both! but glory to Allah, the Lord of the Throne: (High is He) above what they attribute to Him!  Sura 59:22-24 "Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah. (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms (or Colours). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.”     Epilogue  I fully realize that the Muslim understanding of Allah falls short of the Arab Christian understanding of the term. I say this because the Qur’an denies crucial Christian doctrines like the incarnation, the Sonship of Jesus and his atoning death, among others. It seems wise to me to help Christians from Islamic background to understand Allah through Christian glasses which will not be hard for them. If we Christians rehabilitated the 102 words on the cover page of this paper for YHWH as is evident in the translations of the Bible in these languages, we can certainly polish “Allah” for YHWH without much effort. Unless one is strict Yahwist who believes that to call the true God by any other name but Yahweh is blasphemy, there is nothing that prevents us from baptizing proper names for YHWH as Bible writers did repeatedly. To be honest, “Allah” is a much closer word to “YHWH” than many words like El, Theos, God, Egziabher and Dio, to name a few. Finally, since Jesus spoke Aramaic, he certainly referred to YHWH as “Alaha” which, as I said earlier, is related to “Allah”.    Source:   BLib 2066     Footnote  1. Bryant, T. Alton (ed.).

        “I knew that my God was bigger than his [Somali Muslim warlord] God. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol.” 1   Army Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Conservative Evangelical June 2002    “We meet here today not as Muslims or Christians or Jews…not as people of Arab or European descent or African or Asian descent ... We are children of the same God and of the same father, Abraham. We are quite literally brothers and sisters.”2 Senator Joseph Lieberman Practicing Jew (He was addressing an Arab-American group). October 2003    Prologue   The question of who Allah is has been a mystery to most Western Christians for many years. During the Crusades (1095-1270), many Western Christians thought that Muslims worshipped Muhammad—though the terms Muhammedans and Muhammednism were not yet coined until 16813. There are many Western Christian scholars who believe that Allah was a pagan moon god worshipped in Arabia before Islam.   Although considered derogatory by Muslims, the Catholic Encyclopedia still uses Muhammedans and Muhammedanism4 for Muslims and Islam, respectively.   In this presentation, we will examine the origins of the word “Allah”. We will also study who Allah is in Islam and in (Arabic) Christianity as well. The last but not the least, we will also investigate pre-Islamic archeological evidence concerning the term.    I. Allah: An Arabic Word for God   Many scholars believe that the word Allah comes from the Aramaic/Syriac “alaha”, which means “God” or “the God.” This school of thought teaches that the definite article, the final “a”, in the word was dropped off when the word was barrowed into Arabic. Another school of thought teaches that Allah comes from the Arabic, “al Ilah” which means “the God.” Arab Christians have always used Allah for YHWH and still continue to do so.   Needless to say, Muhammad did not coin the word Allah and the word itself is pre- Islamic in nature. Muhammad’s father was called “Abdallah”, which means the servant of Allah, though he was a pagan from a pagan family. The polytheistic Arabs adopted Allah as one of their numerous deities. It was only in AD 630 that the prophet of Islam forcefully rehabilitated the word destroying the numerous idols associated with Allah.   Abd Al-Masih, a famous German writer on Islam, says “Satan met Muhammad, disguised himself using the old Arabic name for God, ‘Allah’ and demanded from him total submission and worship.”5 Abd Al-Masih only accuses Muslims of worshipping “the wrong Allah”, not of worshipping an idol!   Fouad Elias Accad, the great Christian scholar from Lebanon, says that “offshoot Christian sects such the Nestorians sent missionaries throughout the Arabia during the sixth and the seventh centuries A.D. During this same time period, there was the appearance of Bedouin seekers after the one true God, truly monotheists, who were called “Hanifs.” These people were the first to use the term Allah for the one God.”6  The late prominent Al Azhar scholar, Dr. Abd al Ati, gives the Muslim understanding of Allah in his own words: “Finally, the word Allah in Islam simply but most emphatically means the One and the only Eternal God, Creator of the universe, Lord of all lords, and King of all kings.”7   Muslims do not see Allah as an exclusive deity just for them. The Qur’an says "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you [Jews and Christians]; Our Allah and your Allah is one; and it is to Him we bow (in Islam)." Sura 29:46.    II. Allah & Arab Christians  There are about 12 million Arab Christians in the Middle East. All these Christians, whether Coptic, Orthodox or Protestant, use Allah for God. In the Arabic Bible, John 3:16 would read “For Allah so loved that he gave his only begotten Son….” In fact, “ a stone lintel recovered by archaeologists and dated to about 100 years BEFORE Mohammed reads in Arabic “Blessed be Allah the father of our Lord Jesus Chist”8—this is a quote from Ephesians 1:3.  Though Muslims and Christians use the same term for God, there is a difference when Muslims and Christians use Allah. Christians see their Allah as Trinitarian who sent his own Son die on the cross for the redemption of sinners. Muslims see their Allah as a non-Trinitarian who has no Son to send—their understanding of Allah is very close to the Jewish understanding of YHWH.    III. Allah According to the Qur’an  Sura 22:40 “Did not Allah check one set of people by means of another, there would surely have been pulled down monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is commemorated in abundant measure.”  Sura 2:136. “Say ye: ‘We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Isma'il, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to (all) prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah (in Islam)."’   Sura 3:3 “It is He [Allah] Who sent down to thee (step by step), in truth, the Book, confirming what went before it; and He sent down the Law (of Moses) and the Gospel (of Jesus) before this, as a guide to mankind, and He sent down the criterion (of judgment between right and wrong).   Sura 21:22 “If there were, in the heavens and the earth, other gods besides Allah, there would have been confusion in both! but glory to Allah, the Lord of the Throne: (High is He) above what they attribute to Him!  Sura 59:22-24 "Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- Who knows (all things) both secret and open; He, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Allah is He, than Whom there is no other god;- the Sovereign, the Holy One, the Source of Peace (and Perfection), the Guardian of Faith, the Preserver of Safety, the Exalted in Might, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory to Allah. (High is He) above the partners they attribute to Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Evolver, the Bestower of Forms (or Colors). To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names: whatever is in the heavens and on earth, doth declare His Praises and Glory: and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.”    IV.

        Genesis 18:1-19:38    “Those shameful acts against nature, such as were committed in Sodom, ought everywhere and always to be detested and punished. If all nations were to do such things, they would be held guilty of the same crime by the law of God, which has not made men so that they should use one another in this way". Saint Augustine (Confessions 3:8:15) [A.D. 400]).1  “Saying that the last recorded acts of the Sodomites -- the demands for same-gender sex -- are proof that they were destroyed for homosexuality is like saying that a condemned man cursing his guards on the way to his execution is being executed for cursing the guards. Sodom was judged worthy of destruction before the incident with Lot and the angels.” Inge Anderson.2    Prologue  This is a sensitive topic! In exegeting the passage on Sodom and Gomorrah in a quite non-traditional way, I am taking the risk to be misunderstood. Though it is humanly impossible, I will try to approach the passage, Genesis 18-19, without any preconceived conclusions.   Most Christians worldwide believe that Sodom and Gomorrah were overturned because of their homosexual tendencies. I will faithfully study the passage in question and survey the Bible to separate fact from fiction.   I always thought I knew precisely why Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed on that fateful night. I was brought up a Muslim. My father, a respected Islamic Sheik, taught me Islam early on. It is common belief in Islam that the People of Lot, Sodom and Gomorrah, were destroyed because of their homosexual practices   Sodom  Sodom was the most well known of the Cities of the Plain. Other cities included Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim and Zoar which was spared. The Cities of the Plain were most likely located the S part of the Dead Sea. Some archeologists identified the ruins of Bab edh-Dhra and Numeira which were discovered in 1973 as Sodom and Gomorrah, respectively.    The Case Against Sodom   Islam teaches that Qaumu Lut, the People of Lot, were the first homosexuals. Whether this is a fact or merely a hyperbole is beside the point. What is apparent in the Qur’an is that the reason God destroyed these people was that they were practicing homosexuality. In fact, the Muslim holy Book says nothing about lesbian behavior but it is pretty clear about gays. The Qur’an* says:   “We also (sent) Lut: He said to his people: "Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you? "For ye practise your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds." 7:80-81. "Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, "And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing (all limits)!” 26: 165-166.  “He [Lut] said: "I do detest your doings." "O my Lord! deliver me and my family from such things as they do!" So We delivered him and his family,- all Except an old woman who lingered behind. But the rest We destroyed utterly. We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)! Verily in this is a Sign: but most of them do not believe. And verily thy Lord is He, the Exalted in Might Most Merciful.” 26: 168-175.  John Chrysostom also wrote in AD 390 "[The pagans] were addicted to the love of boys, and one of their wise men made a law that pederasty . . . should not be allowed to slaves, as if it was an honorable thing; and they had houses for this purpose, in which it was openly practiced. And if all that was done among them was related, it would be seen that they openly outraged nature, and there was none to restrain them. . . . As for their passion for boys, whom they called their 'paedica,' it is not fit to be named" (Homilies on Titus 5).4  When I first read the Bible at age 15, I found nothing to challenge by belief about Sodom and Gomorrah, the “sexual perverts”. When the Lord found me at age 18, I was more convinced than ever that Sodom and Gomorrah were annihilated because of their sexual orientation. However, I never challenged my preconceived conviction. “Don’t the Hebrew and the Messianic Bibles and the Qur’an as well teach that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for gay and lesbian behavior?” I always asked myself. To this day, the vast majority of the adherents of these faiths believe Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for sodomy. I am not flattered by what the majority believes for the majority can be dead wrong many times. Most scientists once thought that the earth was flat!   Though it is clear in the Bible,* in its totality, that homosexuality is sinful and displeasing to God, the Genesis passage often quoted as a proof seems a victim of eisogesis. Following passages teach the unnaturalness and sinfulness of same-sex sexual relations:  “Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.” Leviticus 18:22. " 'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.” Leviticus 20:13. Talking about the godless, apostle Paul wrote, “God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.” Romans 1:26-27.   Surveying The Bible   The first significant mention of Sodom is seen in connection with Lot's choosing a pleasant place to live. The warning given says, “Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD” Genesis 13:13.  A few chapters later, we see that the wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah was so great that the Lord had to come and see for himself. In fact, the cities were so wicked that even ten righteous people could not be found there. It is noteworthy though to see that the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah was sealed long before the angelic visit.5 These towns were marked for death before their attempted gang rape:  “Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know." Genesis 18: 20-21. Two angels whose mission included saving Lot and his family were therefore dispatched to    Sodom:   “The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. "My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning."  "No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square." Genesis 19:1-2.   As Genesis 28:11 bears witness, it was not uncommon then travelers to spend the night in the open. Lot, because of his hospitality would not allow even aliens to sleep in the open and he took them home with him. It is significant case that no one else in the vicinity extended a hospitable hand to the traveling strangers. It is also possible that Lot feared that some people from town would molest and mistreat the travelers.  But can we deduce from the demand of the attackers to "know" the visitors that all people in Sodom were entirely or largely homosexuals? Probably not but one clear thing is that they did not treat strangers well with respect.  When Lot stood up to defend his guests, the people referred to him as an alien, too, as a sufficient ground to abuse him. "Get out of our way," they replied. And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.” Genesis 9: 9.  The prophets said a number of times that the sins of the Israelites were as bad as or even worse than the sins of Sodom. Could this mean that the prophets implied that the Israelites were largely homosexual? I absolutely not! “Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence. The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.” Isaiah 3:6-9. “And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah." Jeremiah 23:14. “Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. You not only walked in their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD , your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done.” Ezekiel 16: 46-48.   After accusing the Israelites of committing sins worse than the people of Sodom had committed, he continues to name the sins of Sodom. Though the list cannot be considered exhaustive, he must have named the core sins of Sodom otherwise his specification would be worthless. Homosexuality is missing from the list: “Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.” Ezekiel 16: 49-50.   And in the following texts, Sodom is listed as a "sister" of Israel, indicating the similarities of their sins. Thus, if same-gender sexual practices were the special sins of Sodom, there should be some evidence that they were the sins of Israel as well. Yet the Bible leaves no such record.  While many people do not think that the Capernaumians were more sinful than the people of Sodom, Jesus indicates that the people of Sodom were less hardened than the people Capernaum! “And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.” Matthew 11: 23.  It seems to me that that Jude records the strongest evidence that the people of Sodom were destroyed for their homosexual lifestyle, depending of which version of the Bible you read. Therefore, according to the following versions of the Bible, the people of Sodom were guilty of NIV: perversion. NASB: strange flesh. MSG: ruin. NLV: sinful acts of the body. WE: wrong things. YLT: other flesh. NIRV: sins of the worst possible kind—take your pick! “In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.” Jude 7.    The Reason for the Destruction  According to the above passages, it seems that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for committing a number of disturbing sins. To say that homosexuality was the chief sin for the destructions is certainly an error. In fact, the sins committed by these people are very common in today’s affluent societies. These sins include, among others, pride, self-sufficiency, sexual immorality, gluttony, greed, hypocrisy, cruelty, judgmental attitude, inhospitality,6 and general rebellion against God. Focusing on one particular sin, like homosexuality, or attaching some value to “number ten”, as some do, is missing the mark.  The Babylonian Talmud, which dates back to the Babylonian Exile in the 6 BC, offers an interesting perspective on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah:  “A certain maiden gave some bread to a poor man, hiding it in a pitcher. On the matter becoming known, they daubed her with honey and placed her on the parapet of the wall, and the bees came and consumed her. Thus it is written, And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, because it is great (rabbah): whereupon Rab Judah commented in Rab's name: on account of the maiden (ribah).” 7 The Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 109a.   It is not even implied in the context of Genesis 18-19 that Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed solely for homosexual trespasses,8 the claim itself shows a deep-rooted obsession with sexuality, especially homosexuality. This should not raise many eyebrows given the early history of the church where sex became synonymous with sin and celibacy with sainthood. It was John Chrysostom who wrote:   "If you [O, monk] are young in either body or mind, shun the companionship of other young men and avoid them as you would a flame. For through them the enemy has kindled the desires of many and then handed them over to eternal fire, hurling them into the vile pit of the five cities under the pretense of spiritual love.. At meals take a seat far from other young men. In lying down to sleep let not their clothes be near yours, but rather have an old man between you. When a young man converses with you, or sings psalms facing you, answer him with eyes cast down, lest perhaps by gazing at his face you receive a seed of desire sown by the enemy and reap sheaves of corruption and ruin. Whether in the house or in a place where there is no one to see your actions, be not found in his company under the pretense either of studying the divine oracles or of any other business whatsoever, however necessary"9 (The Renunciation of the World [A.D. 373]).    Epilogue  Though homosexuality was one of the sins committed by the people of Sodom, elevating this one sin above others is unwarranted. It is obviously silly and hypocritical to consider homosexuality a worse sin than heterosexual sin, adultery and fornication—and this is precisely what many Christians do. In fact, under the Hebrew Bible, all who committed sins like homosexuality, adultery, fornication and bestiality, etc) were to be stoned to death. Leviticus 20.   As I indicated above, there are several passages in both testaments that teach the sinfulness of same sex intimacy. As Christians, we should be content with these and abstain from reading into the Bible to make sure it says what we want to hear—this is eisogesis, which is the chief sin in biblical hermeneutics.   In short, there were certainly homosexuals in Sodom and Gomorrah, but that their sin far exceeds same sex intimacy is seen throughout the Bible as I have demonstrated above. The people of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly spoiled and overfed and ungrateful to the Lord. The Babylonian Talmud also says that they were very cruel to one another and extremely mean towards traveling foreigners. The Talmud best illustrates this by saying that “... they had beds upon which travellers slept. If the guest was too long they shortened him by lopping off his feet; if too short, they stretched him out...”10 No wonder travelers preferred to spend the night in the open!   *Unless otherwise noted, all Bible quotations are from the NIV.

       “God will render to every man according to his deeds” Apostle Paul    Prologue  Either St Chrysostom or Hillary first used the phrase, “original sin ” in the 4th century. The Psalmist “Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me” (Psalm 51:5) was often quoted to proof text the doctrine of original sin . John Wesley wrote “Adam’s sin was the sin of a public person, one whom God had appointed to represent all his descendents.” Hence, all children are from their birth “children of wrath; void of all righteousness, and propense to sin of all sorts.”1   It will take an eisegesis of immense proportion to claim that this Psalm supports original sin. A face value interpretation of this verse could simply be that David’s parents were in sin when he was conceived. Whatever his parents were doing we do not know. It is also possible that David was still grieving about his adultery and murder and thus used an exaggeration to make the point that he was a wretched sinner—even from conception. Nothing indicates in this verse that David is claiming to be guilty of Adam’s sin. Exaggeration for the sake of making a point is not foreign to the Bible; this is a book where mountains clap and jump with joy and that the smallest seed it recognizes is the mustard seed!   Another popular Psalm used to support original sin is 58:3 “Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.” It will take a giant leap of logic to claim here that David is talking about children inheriting Adam’s sin. David is using a hyperbole to make a point. Children do not obviously become wayward and wicked at birth and they do not lie—they cannot even speak!   I strongly disagree with Wesley at this point; Wesley here barrowed Augustinian federalism wholesale without critically examining it. The direct and the representative participations of Adam’s sin, as stated by Wesley, is not air tight at best, and unbiblical at worst. Wesley should have rejected the federal system of original sin since the Calvinist’s total depravity is largely based on the federal system of this doctrine.  If children inherit original sin from Adam, what can we say about Jesus? Since original sin is supposedly inherited through the male line as it is carried in the semen, as Augustine taught, Mary must have inherited it from her father! The Roman Catholic Church “solved” this problem by claiming that Mary was born without the original sin, in other words, she was exempted from Adam’s sin!    The Eastern Church*  While the Eastern Church has never canonized Augustine, his feast day is celebrated on June 15 in the New Calendar and June 28 in the Old Calendar. Several Eastern calendars and listings of saints, including the 1998 Eastern Church Calendar published by the very Eastern Patriarchate of Moscow, clearly list him as "the Blessed Augustine" on the calendar for June 15/28.   The Eastern Church also fully recognizes the vast theological work undertaken by this African genius. In fact, St. Augustine was not that well known to the East as his works were not yet translated into Greek until the 14th century. Augustine did not therefore have any significant impact on the Eastern Church until the 17th century when Ukraine and 18th century Russia where introduced to the works of St. Augustine primarily through the influence of western clergy and the establishment of Latin theological schools.   Furthermore, the Eastern and the Western churches do not define “original sin” in the same way. In the Eastern Church, the term original sin refers to the first sin Adam and Eve committed. As a result of this sin, people bear the "consequences" of sin, which brings death upon the entire humanity. Here the word original is simply synonymous with first. Therefore, the original sin refers to the first sin. A fair summary of the East’s understanding of “original sin ” can be summed up like this:   “No sin that is committed is without its effect. Every sin that you and I commit – every sin that is ever committed –disrupts the entire cosmos. Your sin has an effect not only on you but on everyone and everything else. Any sin that you and I commit has a reverberation throughout the world, throughout the cosmos. Every puff that you take on your cigarette pollutes the air that everyone else breathes, so to speak. So when the Old Testament claims that the sin of the father will be visited upon the children, it is not issuing a threat; it is simply describing reality.”2   The Augustinian West  In the Augustinian West, all people bear the "consequences" of the original sin of Adam and Eve. However, the West generally believes that all people are guilty of the sin Adam and Eve had committed. The term original sin here refers to the condition into which humanity is born, a condition in which guilt as well as consequence is involved. In the Eastern Church, people face the consequences of the original or the first sin but they are not guilty of that willful sin committed by Adam and Eve. For example, Adolph Hitler, the mass murderer, is known to have committed atrocities of genocide. His family, nuclear or extended, may very well bear the consequences of his action—people may shy away from them and say, "Watch out for them - they come from the Hitler family." Their names may be tainted, or they may face some other forms of discrimination as a consequence of their relative’s sin. They, however, are not personally guilty of his sin. In fact, the name “Hitler” is outlawed in Germany and it is illegal to give it your children. Long before this law, the entire Hitler family changed their last names though they had nothing to do with his genocide.  The Augsburg Confession of Faith of the Lutherans (1530) says that: “…all men, born according to nature, are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without confidence towards God and with concupiscence, and that this original disease or flaw is truly a sin, bringing condemnation and also eternal death to those who are not reborn through baptism and the Holy Spirit” (Article II).3 Though many protestant churches do not teach today that infant baptism takes care of the original sin of children when they are baptized as infants, their mother church, the Roman Catholic Church, still teaches this.   It is clear in the OT that children are not responsible for their parents’ sins and vice versa. Ezekiel 18:20 says “The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.”   Augustine Himself   First, Augustine taught that everyone descended from Adam inherited the personal judgment that befell Adam, therefore he said, everyone is born guilty of the original sin. Second, so corrupted and helpless is the human race that all its members cannot shun sin. It is possible that Augustine was heavily influenced by apocalyptic and Gnostic myths and his Manichaean past as well.  Augustine’s claim that “in Adam’s fall, we all fell—in Adam’s sin, we all sinned.” is off the mark indeed. Augustine's Latin text of Rom. 5:12 read in quo, which means "in whom." Hence to Augustine it meant "in Adam." The entire human race fell in the sin of Adam and all are therefore born into the world as unregenerate lost sinners as they carry within them the genetic make up or the DNA of Adam.   The Greek text reads which means "inasmuch” or “because of." As such it connects the fall of Adam with the sinful state of the race but does not specify the nature of the connection.4 Furthermore, Augustine did not read Greek, the original language of the NT; he used a Latin translation now called the Vulgate. He concluded that "in whom" referred to Adam and that somehow all people had sinned when Adam had sinned. He made Adam a kind of corporate personality who contained the seeds of all future men and women, which he transmitted through his semen.   Augustine wrote, "We all were in that one man...already the seminal nature was there from which we were to be propagated.”5 This meant that all of Adam's descendants are both corrupted and guilty because they were present inside of him biologically when he sinned. Augustine continued to say that all humanity is like a "train of evil" headed for the "destruction of the second death."6   Augustine associated original sin with concupiscence. Though his idea has elements of contradiction, one thing is clear: Augustine saw it as a punishment of Adam’s sin and also the cause of the original sin itself as a condition and it is “equated with lex peccati, cupiditas and libido.”7   Augustinianism   The teaching of an inherited sin, another term for original sin, is deeply flawed though some pre-Augustine Latin Fathers, like Tertullian, taught this8. This is nothing short than traducianism that is certainly the background of Tertullian. Tertullian based his teaching of inherited sin on his understanding that all individual souls collectively were in Adam and therefore sinned with him; he thus agrees with Augustine in this. This is what canon 2 of the Council of Orange (529) reflects: “If anyone asserts that Adam's sin affected him alone and not his descendants also, or at least if he declares that it is only the death of the body which is the punishment for sin, and not also that sin, which is the death of the soul, passed through one man to the whole human race, he does injustice to God and contradicts the Apostle, who says, "Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned.”9 (Rom. 5:12).The Catholic Encyclopedia defines original sin as “…the hereditary stain with which we are born on account of our origin or descent from Adam.10 This Encyclopedia continues to say that Adam transmits sin to his descendents by generation.11 This definition of original sin is in accordance with the Council of Carthage held in 418 which stated: “Whoever denies that newly born infants are to be baptized, or says that they are indeed baptized for the remission of sins but that they do not derive [trahere] anything of the original sin from Adam which is expiated in the bath of regeneration, and consequently, that for them the form of baptism—“for the remission sins”—is to be understood, not in a true, but in a false sense: let him be anathema. Because the words of the apostle: “By one man sin entered into the world (and through sin death), and so passed into all men; in whom all have sinned” (cf. Ro 5:12), cannot be understood in any other way than as the Catholic Church everywhere has always understood them. Because of this rule of faith even infants, who have not yet been able to commit any personal sins, are truly baptized for the remission of sins that in them may be washed away by regeneration which they have contracted by generation [ut in eis regeneratione mundetur, quod generatione traxerunt].”12    Epilogue  The most biblical way to see what is termed as “original sin” or the first sin, is to describe it as a learned behavior of choice; “Augustine says in his book on the Baptism of infants (De Pecc. Merit. et Remiss. i, 39) that on account of original sin little children have the aptitude of concupiscence though they have not the act.”13 Since aptitude certainly denotes some kind of habit, original sin must be a habit. Therefore, no one inherits a sin or “sin gene” from their parents. The truth is that we deliberately learn to sin because the world is completely fallen and entirely permeated with sin. Ezekiel teaches that children are not responsible for their parents’ sins. Therefore, we all sin (1 John 1:8-10) because we have all chosen the path of sin and destruction (Rom 3:10-18).  John also wrote in Revelations 20:12, “And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.” John adds in verse 13 “…and each person was judged according to what he had done.”   Matthew 12:36-37; Romans 2:6; 2 Corinthians 5:10; 1 Peter 1:17, among others, tell us plainly that we will be judged by what we ourselves do, our own sins. Isaiah 59:2 says “But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you.” We see here that Adam or his first sin is not blamed for our sins. Furthermore, 1 John 3:4 says that individuals commit sins and thus break God’s law; but infants are obviously too young to break laws they do not even know exist! I will therefore conclude with this paper that God will never punish anyone for a sin committed by someone else including Adam.    *Eastern Church/Christianity refers collectively to Eastern Easterny and Oriental Easterny, especially when speaking more about what they share in common than about the ways they differ.

       The Foundation of Our Faith   1.  SU'AAL: Immisa Ilaah ayaa jirta?  JAWAAB: Waxaa jira hal Ilaah oo xaq ah.  AAYAD: Markos 12: 29b "Maqal, Israa'iilow, Rabbiga Ilaaheenna ah waa Rabbi keliya."  2.  SU'AAL: Maxaa loola jeedaa Saddexmidnimo?  JAWAAB: Saddexmidnimadu waa eray ka war bixiya sida Ilaah isugu muujiyo Kitaabka Qudduuska ah, sida Aabbaha, Wiilka, iyo Ruuxa Qudduuska ah. Inkasta oo uu mid kasta oo ka mid ah Saddexmidnidu yahay Ilaah kaamil ah marna lama macne ahan saddex Ilaah. Eeg su'aasha 1aad.  AAYAD: 2 Korintos 13: 14 "Nimcada Rabbi Ciise Masiix iyo jacaylka Ilaah iyo wehelmnimada Ruuxa Qoduuska ahu kulligiin ha idinla jireen."   3.  SU'AAL: Aabbahu ma Ilaah kaamil ah baa?  JAWAAB: Haa, Aabbahu waa Ilaah kaamil ah?  AAYAD: Filiboy 2: 11 "Iyo in carrab kastaaba qirto in Ciise Masiix yahay Rabbiga in Ilaaha Aabbaha ah lagu ammaano."  4.  SU'AAL: Wiilku ma Ilaah kaamil ah baa?  JAWAAB: Haa, Wiilku waa Ilaah kaamil ah?  AAYAD: Yooxanaa 20: 28 "Toomas ayaa u jawaabay oo ku yidhi, Rabbigay iyo Ilaahayow."  5.  SU'AAL: Ruuxa Qudduuska ahi ma Ilaah kaamil ah baa?  JAWAAB: Haa, Ruuxa Qudduuska ahi waa Ilaah kaamil ah.  AAYAD: Falimaha Rasuullada 5: 3a - 4b "Laakiin Butros baa ku yidhi, Ananiyasow, maxaa Shaydaanku qalbigaaga u geliyey inaad Ruuxa Qoduuska ah been u sheegtid.... Dad been uma aad sheegin, waxaadse u sheegtay Ilaah."    F.G. Seddaxmidnimadu marnaba micnaheedu ma ahan seddax Ilaah. Eeg su'aasha 1aad.  6.  SU'AAL: Yaa abuuray adduunka?  JAWAAB: Ilaah ayaa abuuray adduunka.  AAYAD: Bilowgii 1: 1 "Bilowgii Ilaah samada iyo dhulkuu abuuray."  7.  SU'AAL: Ilaah wax kasta miyuu og yahay?  JAWAAB: Haa, Ilaah wax kasta waa og yahay?  AAYAD: Maahmaahyadii 15: 3 "Rabbiga indhihiisu meel kastay jiraan, iyagoo fiirinaya kuwa xun iyo kuwa wanaagsan."  8.  SU'AAL: Waa maxaay Kitaabka Qudduuska ahi?  JAWAAB: Kitaabka Qudduuska ahi waa Erayga Ilaah.  AAYAD: 2 Timoteyos 3: 16 "Qorniin kastaa wuxuu ku ahaaday Ruuxa Ilaah oo waxtar buu u leeyahay waxbaridda, iyo canaanashada, iyo hagaajinta, iyo edbinta xagga xaqnimada."  9.  SU'AAL: Kitaabka Qudduuska ahi muxuu ka kooban yahay?  JAWAAB: Kitaabka Qudduuska ahi wuxuu ka kooban yahay Sharcigii nebi Muuse (Towreed), Sabuurkii nebi Daa'uud, Qorniinkii nebiyada, iyo Axdiga Cusub (Injiil).  AAYAD: 1 Boqoradii 2: 3a "Oo Rabbiga Ilaahaaga ahna amarkiisa xaji, si aad jidadkiisa ugu socoto, oo aad u dhowrto qaynuunnadiisa, iyo amarradiisa, iyo xukummadiisa, iyo markhaatifurkiisa, si waafaqsan waxa ku qoran sharciga Muuse..."  Luukos 20: 42 "Daa'uud qudhiisa ayaa Kitaabkii Sabuurrada ku leh, Rabbigu wuxuu Sayidkayga ku yidhi, midigtayda fadhiiso."  Yooxanaa 6: 45a "Waxaa ku qoran kitaabbadii nebiyada, Kulligood Ilaah baa wax bari doona."  Luukos 24: 44 "Wuxuu ku yidhi, Kuwani waa hadalladaydii aan idinkula hadlay intii aan weli idinla jiray. Waa in ay noqdaan wax walba oo sharciga Muuse iyo nebiyadii iyo sabuurrada laygaga qoray oo igu saabsanaa."  10.  SU'AAL: Yaa qoray Kitaabka Qudduuska ah?  JAWAAB: Kitaabka Qudduuska ah waxaa qoray Ilaah isagoo adeegsanaya dad barakaysan oo qudduusiin ah oo uu hoggaaminayay Ruuxa Qudduuska ahi.  AAYAD: 2 Butros 1: 21 "Waayo, wixii nebiyadii sii sheegeen weligood kuma ay iman dadka doonistiisa, laakiinse dad Ruuxa Qoduuska ahu waday ayaa xagga Ilaah kaga hadlay."   11.  SU'AAL: Wax miyaa lagu dari karaa ama laga dhimi karaa Kitaabka Qudduuska ah?  JAWAAB: Maya! Wax lagu dari karo ama laga dhimi karo Kitaabka Qudduuska ahi ma jiraan.  AAYAD: Muujintii 22: 18 - 19 "Oo haddii nin wax ka qaado erayadii kitaabka wax-sii-sheegiddan, isna Ilaah baa qaybtiisa ka qaadi doona geedka nolosha iyo magaalada qoduuska ah iyo waxyaalaha kitaabkan ku qoran."  12.  SU'AAL: Ilaah muxuu Aadan ka abuuray?  JAWAAB: Ilaah Aadan wuxuu ka abuuray ciidda dhulka.  AAYAD: Bilowgii 2: 7 "Rabbiga Ilaah ahuna nin buu ka sameeyay ciidda dhulka, dulalka sankiisana wuxuu kaga afuufay neeftii nolosha; ninkiina wuxuu noqday naf nool."    13.  SU'AAL: Ilaah muxuu ka abuuray Xaawa?  JAWAAB: Ilaah Xaawa wuxuu ka abuuray feertii Aadan.  A AYAD: Bilowgii 2: 21 - 22 "Oo Rabbiga Ilaah ahu hurdo weyn buu ku riday ninkii, kolkaasuu gam'ay; kolkaasuu ka bixiyey feedhiisii middood, meesheediina hilib buu ku awday. Oo feedhii Rabbiga Ilaah ahu ka bixiyey ninka ayuu naag ka sameeyey, oo wuxuu iyadii u keenay ninkii."  14.  SU'AAL: Ilaah muxuu u abuuray dadka?  JAWAAB: Ilaah wuxuu u abuuray dadka in ay isaga sharfaan oo ay caabudaan.    AAYAD: Ishacyaah 43: 7 "Waana mid kasta oo magacayga loogu yeedho, oo aan u uumay sharaftayda aawadeed. Anigaa sameeyey, oo anigaa suubiyey."   15.  SU'AAL: Sidee ayaan u sharfi karnaa una caabudi karnaa Ilaah?  JAWAAB: Ilaah waxaan u sharfi karnaa una caabudi karnaa in aan isaga jeclaano oo aan camal wanaagsanna aan la nimaadno.  AAYAD: Matayos 5: 16 "Sidaas oo kale iftiinkiinnu dadka hortiisa ha iftiimo, si ay shuqulladiinna wanaagsan u arkaan, oo ay Aabbihiinna jannada ku jira u ammaanaan."  16.  SU'AAL: Halkee ayey Adan iyo Xaawa ku noolaayeen markii hore?  JAWAAB: Adan iyo Xaawa markii hore waxay ku noolaayeen beer Ceeden.  AAYAD: Bilowgii 2: 15 - 17 "Rabbiga Ilaah ahuna ninkii wuu kaxeeyey oo wuxuu geeyey beer Ceeden inuu falo oo dhawro. Rabbiga Ilaah ahuna wuxuu ninkii ku amray isagoo leh, Geed kasta oo beerta ku yaal; wax baad ka cuni kartaa: laakiin geedka aqoonta wanaagga iyo xumaanta waa inaanad waxba ka cunin: waayo, maalintii aad wax ka cuntid hubaal waad dhiman doontaa."  17.  SU'AAL: Muxuu Ilaah uga eryey Aadan iyo Xaawa beertii Ceeden?  JAWAAB: Ilaah wuu ka eryey Aadan iyo Xaawa beer Ceeden waayo waxay wax ka cuneen geedkii looga digay in aanay waxba ka cunin.  AAYAD: Bilowgii 3: 6 "Oo markii naagtii aragtay in geedkii cunto ku wanaagsan yahay, oo indhaha u roon yahay, oo uu yahay geed loo doonayo in caqli lagu yeesho, ayey midho ka qaadatay, oo cuntay; ninkeedii la joogayna wax bay ka siisay, oo isagiina wuu cunay."  18.  SU'AAL: Waa maxaay dembi?  JAWAAB: Dembi waa caasinimo iyo wax kasta oo qilaafsan ammarada Ilaah.  AAYAD: 1 Yooxanaa 3: 4 "Kii kasta oo dembi falaa wuxuu falaa caasinimo; oo dembigu wuxuu yahay caasinimo."  19.  SU'AAL: Ma jiraa qof aan dembi lahayni?  JAWAAB: Maya, ma jiro qof aan dembi lahayni.  AAYAD: 1 Yooxanaa 1: 8 "Haddaynu nidhaahno, Dembi ma lihin, nafsaddeenna ayaynu khiyaanaynaa, oo runtuna inaguma jirto."  20.  SU'AAL: Dhib intee la'eg ayaa ka dhashay dembigii Aadan iyo Xaawa iyo keennaba?  JAWAAB: Dhammaanteen waxaan ku caasinnay oo aan ka fogaannay Ilaah waxaana mudan keennu yahay in aan dhimano waayo ciqaabta dembiga ayaa ah dhimasho keliya.  AAYAD: Rooma 3: 23 "Maxaa yeelay, dhammaan way wada dembaabeen oo gaadhi waayeen ammaanta Ilaah."  Rooma 6: 23a "Waayo, mushahaarada dembihu waa dhimashada,..."  21.  SU'AAL: Sayid Ciise Masiix weligiis miyuu dembaabay?  JAWAAB: Maya! Sayid Ciise Masiix weligiis ma dembaabin haba yaraatee.  AAYAD: Cibraaniyada 4: 15b "Laakiin waxaynu leennahay mid [Sayid Ciise Masiix] si walba loo jirrabay sideenna oo kale, oo aan weliba dembi lahayn."  22.  SU'AAL: Ilaah muxuu sammeeyey si uu u sugo badbaadadeenna?  JAWAAB: Ilaah, naxariistiisa aawadeed, wuxuu bixiyey qiimihii dembigeenna kaddib markii uu soo diray Sayid Ciise Masiix si uu iskutallaabta ugu dhinto dembiyadeenna aawadood.  AAYAD: Rooma 5: 8 - 9 "Laakiinse waa inoo dhintay intaynu weli dembiilayaal ahayn, oo sidaasuu Ilaah jacaylkiisii inoohu muujiyey. Haddaba haddaynu haatan dhiigiisa xaq ku noqonnay, de si ka baddana isagaynu isagaynu kaga badbaadi doonnaa cadhada Ilaah."  23.  SU'AAL: Sidee ayaynu ku heli karnaa badbaado?  JAWAAB: Waa in aan Sayid Ciise Masiix u rumaynaa in uu yahay Badbaadiyaheenna.  AAYAD: Falimaha Rasuullada 16: 31a "Kolkaasay ku yidhaahdeen, Rumayso Rabbi Ciise, waadna badbaadi doontaa."  24.  SU'AAL: Maxaa loola jeedaa in aan u rumayno Sayid Ciise Masiix in uu yahay Badbaadiyaheenna?  JAWAAB: In aan u rumayno Sayid Ciise Masiix in uu yahay Badbaadiyaheenna waxaa loola jeedaa in aan ka toobad keenno dembiyadeennii hore oo aan isaga keligiis si rasmi ah ugu kalsoonaanno in uu inna siiyo badbaado maaddaama uu yahay Sayidkeenna u dhintay dembiyadeennii kana soo sara kacay kuwii dhintay.  AAYADO: Falimaha Rasuullada 3: 19a "Haddaba toobad keena oo soo noqda, si dembiyadiinna loo tirtiro..."  Rooma 10: 9 - 10 "Maxaa yeelay, haddaad afka ka qiratid in Ciise yahay Rabbiga, oo aad qalbiga ka rumaysatid in Ilaah isaga ka sara kiciyey kuwii dhintay, waad badbaadi doontaa, waayo, qalbiga wax baa laga rumaystaa xagga xaqnimada, afkana wax baa laga qirtaa xagga badbaadinta."    25.  SU'AAL: Badbaadadeenna ma shaqaysan karnaa haddii aan la nimaadno camal wanaagsan?   JAWAAB: Maya, badbaadadeenna ma shaqaysan karno haddii aan la nimaadno camal kasta oo wanaagsan. Runtii badbaadadeennu waa deeq Ilaah.  AAYADO: Efesos 2: 8 - 9 "Waayo, idinku waxaad ku badbaaddeen nimco xagga rumaysadka, mana aha wax xaggiinna ka yimid, laakiinse waa hadiyadda Ilaah, ma aha xagga shuqullada, si aan ninna ugu faanin."  26.  SU'AAL: Sidee ayaan dembiyadeenna cafis ugu heli karnaa haddaan nahay mu'miniin?  JAWAAB: Waa in aan dembiyadeena Ilaah u qirannaa si uu innooga cafiyo.  AAYAD: 1 Yooxanaa 1: 9 "Haddaynu dembiyadeenna qirano, isagu waa aamin iyo caadil inuu dembiyadeenna inaga cafiyo, oo uu inaga nadiifiyo xaqdarrada oo dhan."   27.  SU'AAL: Haddii ay badbaadadeenu tahay deeq Ilaah oo nimco ah oo aanan innagu shaqaysan karayn, weli miyaa la inaga doonayaa in aan la nimaadno camal wanaagsan?  JAWAAB: Haa, waa in aan la nimaadno camal wanaagsan; inkastoo aanan badbaado ku helayn, haddana, waa miraha iimaanka oo sharfa Ilaah.  AAYAD: Yacquub 2: 18 "Laakiin waxaa la odhan doonaa, Adigu waxaad leedahay rumaysad, anna waxaan leeyahay shuqullo. I tus rumaysadkaaga aan shuqullada lahayn, anna rumaysadkayga shuqulladaydaan kugu tusi doonaa."  28.  SU'AAL: Waa maxaay qudduusnimo?  JAWAAB: Qudduusnimadu waa qumanaan iyo toosnaan hadal iyo camalba leh oo laga doonayo dhammaan Masiixiyiinta oo dhan maaddaama ay yihiin kuwo ku dayanaya Sayid Ciise Masiix.  AAYADO: 1 Butros 1: 15 - 16 "Laakiinse siduu kan idiin yeedhay qoduuska u yahay, idinkuna sidaas oo kale dabiicaddiinna oo dhan qoduus ku ahaada, maxaa yeelay, waxaa qoran, Idinku waa inaad qoduus ahaataan, waayo, aniguba qoduus baan ahay."  29.  SU'AAL: Ruuxa Qudduuska ahi muxuu sameeyaa si uu u caawiyo mu'miniinta?  JAWAAB: Ruuxa Qudduuska ahi wuxuu ku jiraa mu'miniinta si uu u awoodsiiyo in ay nolol qudduus ah ugu noolaadaan Sayid Ciise Masiix dartiis.  AAYAD: 1 Korintos 3: 16 "Miyaanaydin garanaynin inaad tihiin macbudkii Ilaah oo uu Ruuxa Ilaah idinku jiro."  30.  SU'AAL: Waa maxay salaaddu?  JAWAAB: Salaaddu waa la hadlid Ilaah, ku xamdinaqidiis, iyo caabudiddiisaba.  AAYAD: Filiboy 4: 6 "Waxba haka welwelina, laakiinse wax kastaba baryadiinna Ilaah ku ogeysiiya tukasho iyo duco mahadnaqid la jirto."  31.  SU'AAL: Sidee ayaa kaniisadda Ilaah loo taageeraa?  JAWAAB: Kaniisadda Ilaah waxaa taageero u ah hadiyadaha ay bixiyaan xubnaheedu hadba inta ay xubin weliba awooddo.  AAYAD: 1 Korintos 16: 2a "Maalinta ugu horraysa ee toddobaadka midkiin kastaa meel wax ha dhigo oo ha hayo wixii lagu barwaaqeeyey."  32.  SU'AAL: Waa maxay baabtiisku?  JAWAAB: Baabtiisku waa qirasho laga hor sameeyo dad kale inagoo u sheegayna in aan rumaysannay Sayid Ciise Masiix in uu yahay Sayidkeenna kana toobadkeenayna dembiyadeenii. Qofka qirashadan samaynaya ayaa biyo la maquuriyaa oo misna laga soo saaraa si loo muujiyo in uu Sayid Ciise Masiix la dhintay lana soo sara kacay.  AAYADO: Falimaha Rasuullada 8: 36 "Kolkay waddada marayeen waxay yimaadeen meel biya leh, bohonkuna wuxuu yidhi, Bal eeg, waa biyo. Maxaa iga celinaya in lay baabtiiso?"  Fallimaha Rasuullada 19: 5 "Oo markay waxaas maqleen, waxaa iyagii lagu baabtiisay Rabbi Ciise magiciisa."  33.  SU'AAL: Waa maxay Cashada Sayidku?  JAWAAB: Cashada Sayidku waa qaadashada kibista iyo koobka iyadoo lagu xusuusanayo dhimashadii uu Sayid Ciise Masiix innoo dhintay.  AAYADO: Luukos 22: 19 - 20 "Kibisna wuu qaaday, oo goortuu mahad naqay, ayuu kala jejebiyey, oo iyaga siiyey, isagoo leh. Tanu waa jidhkaygii laydiin bixiyey. Waxan xusuustayda u sameeya. Sidaas oo kale cashada dabadeed koobkuu qaaday isagoo leh, Koobkanu waa axdiga cusub oo dhiiggayga aawadiin loo daadshay."  34.  SU'AAL: Yaa ka qayb qaadan karaya Cashada Sayidka?  JAWAAB: Cashada Sayidka waxaa ka qayb qaadan karaya mu'miniinta rumaysatay in Sayid Ciise yahay badbaadiyahooda.  AAYADO: 1 Korintos 11: 28 - 29 "Nin kastaa ha is-imtixaamo, oo sidaas kibista wax ha uga cuno, oo koobka ha uga cabbo. Waayo, kii cuna oo cabba, xukun ayuu naftiisa u cunaa oo u cabbaa isagoo aan jidhka garanaynin."  35.  SU'AAL: Qof Masiixi ahi ma guursan karaa qof aan Masiixi ahayn?  JAWAAB: Maya, qof Masiixi ahi ma guursan karayo qof aan Masiixi ahayn.  AAYADO: 2 Korintos 6: 14 - 15b "Ha noqonina kuwo ku xidhan kuwo aan rumaysanaynin, waayo, sidee bay xaqnimada iyo dembigu isu weheliyaan, ama sidee bay iftiinka iyo gudcurku isu dhex galaan...ama maxaa ka dhexeeya mid rumaysta iyo mid aan rumaysanaynin."  36.  SU'AAL: Maxay noqon ninkii Masiixi noqdaa laakiinse aan weli xaaskiisu Masiixi noqon?  JAWAAB: Ninka Masiixiga noqday yaanuu ka tegin xaaskiisa haddii ay doonayso in ay la sii noolaato. Gabadhuna waa sidaas oo kale, haddii ay Masiixi noqoto ninkeeduna aanuu weli Masiixi noqonin, waa in aanay isaga ka tegin haddii uu doonayo in uu la sii noolaado.  AAYADO: 1 Korintos 7: 12b - 13 "Hadduu mid walaal ah qabo afo aan rumaysanayn, oo ayna raalli ka tahay inay la joogto, yaanu ka tegin. Oo afadii nin aan rumaysanayni qabo oo isna raalli ka yahay in uu la joogo, yaaney ninkeeda ka tegin."  37.  SU'AAL: Ka warran haddii xaaska aan Masiixiga noqon uu iskiis isaga tago?    JAWAAB: Ninka aan Masiixiga noqoni haddii uu doorto ha iska tago, gabadha mu'minadda ahi eed innaba ma leh. Ninka Masiixiga noqdayna waa sidaas oo kale. Haddii xaaskiisa aan mu'minadda noqoni go'aansato in ay iska tagto, isna eedi dushiisa ma ahan.  AAYAD: 1 Korintos 7: 15 "Laakiin haddii kan aan rumaysanayni tago, ha iska tago. Waxaas oo kale walaalka ama walaashu uma xidhxidhna. Ilaah wuxuu inoogu yeedhay nabad.  38.  SU'AAL: Guur cayn kee ah ayaa Ilaah ugu talo galay dadka sida ku cad Kitaabkiisa?  JAWAAB: Hal nin iyo hal naag oo keliya ayaa Ilaah ugu talo galay in ay is guursadaan. Guurkii kulmiya nin iyo naag ka badanna wuxuu qilaafsan yahay qorshaha Ilaah u dhigay dadka sida ku cad Kitaabkiisa.  AAYADO: Markos 10: 7 - 8 "Sababtaas aawadeed nin wuxuu ka tegayaa aabbihiis iyo hooyadiis, wuxuuna la joogayaa naagtiisa. Labaduba waxay noqonayaan isku jidh. Sidaa darteed haatan iyagu laba ma aha, laakiin waa isku jidh.  39.  SU'AAL: Ninkii isagoo hal xaas ka badan leh noqda Masiixi, miyuu furayaa dhammaan oo uu la harayaa tii ugu horaysay oo keliya?  JAWAAB: Maya! Furriinku waa xaaraan Ilaahna aad ayuu u neceb yahay. Gogol dhaaf waxaan ka ahayni ma bannayn karayaan furriin.  AAYADO: Matayos 5: 32 "Laakiin waxaan idinku leeyahay, Mid walba oo naagtiisa furaa sababta sinada aawadeed maahee, wuxuu ka dhigayaa inay sinaysato, oo kii guursadaa tii la furayna waa sinaystaa.  Malaakii 2: 16 "Waayo, Rabbiga ah Ilaaha reer binu Israa'iil wuxuu leeyahay, Anigu waan necbahay furidda, oo Rabbiga ciidammadu wuxuu leeyahay, Anigu waan necbahay kii dharkiisa dulmi ku deda, haddaba sidaas daraaddeed iska jira oo khiyaano ha ku macaamiloonina."  40.  SU'AAL: Ninka isagoo hal xaas ka badan leh noqday Masiixi, ma wuxuu u tegayaa oo keliya xaaskiisii ugu horreysay, oo inta kalena miyuu ka dhowrsanayaa in uu la seexdo in kasta oo uu marasho iyo masruuf siinayo iyaga iyo caruurtoodaba?  JAWAAB: Maya! taasi waxay qilaafsan tahay ammarka Ilaah ee uu dhigayo Kitaabkiisa Qudduuska ahi. Runtii haweenka uu qabo oo dhami waa isku wada xaq waana in uu caddaalad falaa.  AAYAD: Baxniintii 21: 10 "Oo hadduu naag kale la guursado, waa inuusan inna ka dhimin masruufkeeda, iyo dharkeeda, iyo xaqa naagnimadeeda."  41.  SU'AAL: Kaniisaddu miyey baabtiisi ninkii leh hal xaas ka badan ee noqda Masiixi?  JAWAAB: Haa! Kaniisaddu waa in ay baabtiistaa qof kasta oo noqda Masiixi. Shardiga keliya ee ku xiran baabtiiska waa in uu qofkaasi ahaadaa mid toobad keenay oo rumaystay in Sayid Ciise Masiix yahay Badbaadiyihiisa. In loo diidaa in biyo lagu baabtiiso qof Sayid Ciise Masiix rumaystay waxay noqonaysaa in la caasiyo Sayid Ciise Masiixi oo dhaqan geliyey baabtiiska.  AAYAD: Matayos 28: 19 "Haddaba taga, oo quruumaha oo dhan xer ka dhiga, oo ku baabtiisa magaca Aabbaha iyo Wiilka, iyo Ruuxa Qoduuskaa."  42.  SU'AAL: Kaniisaddu ma u ogolaanaysaa in Masiixi leh hal xaas ka badan uu ka qayb qaato Cashada Sayidka?  JAWAAB: Kaniisaddu xaq uma lahan in ay ka hor istaagto qof Masiixi ah in uu ka qayb qaato Cashada Sayidka. Waxa keliya ee ay xaq u leedahay waa in ay u digto mu'min kasta in uu is-imtixaamo isagu bal in uu ka qayb qaadan karayo Cashadaas Sayidka.  AAYADO: 1 Korintos 11: 28, 31 "Nin kastaa ha is imtixaamo, oo sidaas kibista wax ha uga cuno, oo koobka ha uga cabbo....Laakiin haddaynu innagu dhexdeenna iska xukumi lahayn, laynama xukumeen."  43.  SU'AAL: Kaniisaddu ma howl gelin kartaa mu'min leh hal xaas ka badan kaas oo Ilaah ugu yeeray in uu Sayidka si buuxda ugu adeego?  JAWAAB: Haa! Ilaah wuxuu si wayn u isticmaalay rag iimaan iyo daaacadnimo isku darsaday oo hal xaas ka badana lahaa, Ibraahim iyo Daa'uud, in ay dunida barako u soo jiidaan. Xusuuso Saleebaan oo isagoo Ruuxa Qudduuska ahi hoggaaminayo qoray dhowr suuradood oo ka mid ah Maahmaahyadii sida ku cad Kitaaba Qudduuska ah. Intaas waxaa dheer oo Kitaabku dhigayaa, in nin hal xaas ka badan lihi aanuu kaniisadda hoggaamiye ama caawiye ka noqon.  AAYADO: 1 Timoteyos 3: 2a "Sidaas daraaddeed hoggaamiyaha kaniisaddu waa in uu ahaado mid aan ceeb lahayn, oo naag keliya qaba...."  1 Timoteyos 3: 12 "Caawiyayaasha kaniisaddu mid kastaahu naag keliya ha guursado, hana noqdeen kuwo si wanaagsan ugu talinaya carruurtooda iyo guryahooda."  44.  SU'AAL: Maxaa lagu samayn mu'minkii naag labaad guursada?  JAWAAB: Ninkii guursadaa naag labaad ka dib markii uu Masiixi noqday wuxuu gelayaa dembi wayn, wuxuuna qilaafaya qawaaniinta Ilaah ee ku cad Kitaabkiisa. Kaniisaddu waa in ay anshax marisaa ninkan xalaalaystay xaaraanta.  AAYADO: 1 Korintos 5: 11a, 13b "Laakiin hadda waxaan idiin soo qoray, Ha raacina qof walaal la yidhaahdo hadduu sinaysto, ama wax badan damco....Idinkuse kan sharta leh dhexdiinna ka saara."  45.  SU'AAL: Xaggee ayuu haatan ku sugan yahay Sayid Ciise Masiix?  JAWAAB: Sayid Ciise Masiix haatan jannada ayuu ku sugan yahay.  AAYAD: 1 Butros 3: 22 "Ciise Masiix jannaduu galay oo wuxuu joogaa gacanta midig oo Ilaah, oo malaa'igaha iyo kuwa amarka leh iyo kuwa xoogga leh oo dhanba waa laga hoosaysiiyey isaga."  46.  SU'AAL: Waa maxay janno?  JAWAAB: Jannadu waa meel kaamil ah oo loo diyaariyey kuwa badbaaday si ay Ilaah u weheshadaan weligood.  AAYAD: Muujintii 21: 27 "Oo gudaheedana sinaba uma ay geli doonaan wax nijaas ah amase kii sameeya karaahiyo iyo been, laakiinse waxaa keliyahoo geli doona kuwa ku qoran kitaabka nolosha ee Wanka."  47.  SU'AAL: Waa maxay naartu?  JAWAAB: Naartu waa meel leh ciqaab weligeed ah oo loo diyaariyay kuwa aan badbaadin.  AAYAD: Matayos 25: 41 "Markaasuu kuwa bidixdiisa jooga ku odhan doonaa, Kuwa yahow inkaaranu, iga taga oo gala dabka weligiis ah kan Ibliiska iyo malaa'igihiisa loo diyaargareeyey."  48.  SU'AAL: Sayid Ciise Masiix miyuu soo laaban doonaa?  JAWAAB: Haa! Runtii wuu soo laaban doonaa si uu dunida u xukumo.  AAYAD: Matayos 24:30 "Markaasaa waxaa cirka ka soo muuqan doona calaamada Wiilka Aadanaha, markaas ayaa qolooyinka dhulka oo dhammu barooran doonaan, oo waxay arki doonaan Wiilka Aadanaha oo daruuraha cirka ku imanaya isagoo leh xoog iyo ammaan weyn."

      (VOM) Pastor Shueb Maalim Madkheyr was killed and his body burned beyond recognition on April 25 in the Dinsor district in southern Somalia, according to reports received this week by Voice of the Martyrs.  Starting in mid-April, Pastor Shueb had been going into villages in the area, seeking to plant underground churches and sharing the Gospel with teenagers. Word began to spread that Shueb was teaching the Bible to children. On April 25, he was confronted by two armed men and accused of poisoning the minds of young teenagers. According to witnesses, a heated discussion on religion ensued. One of the armed men then shot and killed him. It is believed that the armed men may have been part of an Islamic militia group.  Pastor Shueb was married to Dhaba Dimbile and had five children between the ages of eight months and thirteen years. He was actively involved with the Kenyan office of World in Need, working in relief work as a way to spread the Gospel.

Waxaan islahaa dadkaad ka dhalatay iyo gaal-nimo is heli mayaan Insha’alaah, saa Soomaali waa dad aan diintooda laga soo agmari karine, waa dad ilaashanaya Islaam-nimadooda, waa dad gaalo neceb dhaqan ahaan iyo diin ahaanba.

Yaa yiri Soomaali waa wada Islaam? Intaasi waa warqad kaliyee, ma dheero inaan goor dhaw maqalno ama aragno xaafad kamid ah magaalooyinka Soomaalida oo la leeyahay xaafadan waxaa u badan dadka Kiristanka ah ee Soomaaliyeed.

       urlLink    Somalis in the UK&nbsp; urlLink      Where do they come from?s   Somalia is located on the northeastern seaboard of Africa, bordering the Indian Ocean. The Somali people first settled in Africa around AD1200. Since that time however, they have dispersed throughout the eight countries that make up the Horn of East Africa. The name Somali actually comes from a colloquial phrase that describes their generous nature. Though northern and southern Somalia were untied after they gained their independence from Britain, the majority of the country was ravaged by civil war in 1991, and intermittent clan warfare continued through 1993. The subsequent famine brought the nation to the brink of anarchy. In 1994, UN troops interceded, reestablishing a tentative stability.  Conversely, the Somalians are said to be one of the most unified African people groups in they share a common language, heritage, and faith. Society is extremely patriarchal and is based around the nuclear family. The people consider themselves warriors. Men leave their families to train in effective combat, and in their absence, the women rule their home with a naturally submissive but firm hand.   How do the various clans differ?   There are four distinct clan groupings. The Somaal are predominantly nomadic shepherds, and easily adapt to new and different regions. The Sab are peasant farmers, solid and stable in their permanency. They are a people of deep roots and traditions. The Digil, which include the Dabarre, are commercial farmers. They are the wealthiest of all the tribes. Among the clans, prestige is shown by hospitality. They love to hold feasts and are highly relational, relishing the quality time they spend with family and friends. The chief and his council make decisions concerning business and law.   What do they believe?   Arab tradesman introduced the nation to Islam in the middle of the sixteenth century. Spiritual freedom is limited, however, since the state religion is Islam. The Somali are a mix of Shiafite Islam (80%) and Sufi (a mystic and superstitious branch of Islam). Although the people follow stricter Islamic laws, the women do not wear the traditional coverings. They are overtly influenced by mysticism, often turning to the Wadaad (medicine man or religious leader) for charms and advice. Unfortunately, the sway of folk medicine has brought with it a dependence upon narcotics and the production and use of Khat (an euphoric drug found both in Somalia and the UK) has become rather common. There is a dark cloud over the people. Though there are missionaries who have a heart to reach out to these tribes, there are less than 3000 known Somali believers. They have access to the Bible in their language, but illiteracy is extremely high.   What are their lives like in London?   Because of famine and clan warfare, many Somalians have migrated to the UK. They have retained much of their cultural heritage despite the westernized norms found in cosmopolitan cities like London. The majority of this people group has settled in the London boroughs of Haringey and Hackney. Their society is still based on the nuclear family, and the man is the ruling head of his household. The Somali are a very independent people, and hold fast to their traditions. The women can often be seen wearing the brightly colored cloths that drape over their entire bodies, which, though not black, fits in with the orthodox Muslim standard for modesty. The children have adapted well into the Western culture, while still remaining true to the traditions they were raised under. In some ways, the older generation of women has chosen not to assimilate into this new world, and many are afraid of their western neighbors. On the other hand, ample numbers of men have taken the opportunity to expand their horizons in business and trade. For the most part, however, the Somali remain isolated within their own group, which makes it very difficult to build relationships and share the love of Jesus with them. Pray for people of peace to bridge the gap.

      By Nik Repkin Vol. 34, No. 3     In 1991 a missionary of long tenure and I entered into a dialogue centered on the work in Somalia. Some of his comments are branded in my soul. He claimed that one could not justify "wasting" personnel, money, and witness among Somalis in comparison to the investment being made alongside the Holy Spirit in his country. "You give me one of your missionaries and after 48 days we will start a church. You take them to Somalia and after 48 months the Muslims will still be witnessing to you. You cannot justify that."  In 1992 a trustee of a sponsoring mission board called on the phone from the midst of a crusade in East Africa. In essence, he asked me, "How many people have you baptized, how much money have you spent, and is it cost effective?" He told me, "I will leave my hotel in five minutes. When I return tonight there will be 30 new people in the kingdom of God. You are telling me that you have had one convert in one and a half years? How do you justify staying in that place?"  Are there no places where tillers, weed-pullers, seed planters, and irrigation crews are appropriate? A convert/cost radio per se is not known in Scriptures; we do need to be good stewards of expenses, particularly in constructing "witness platforms" to the dangerously unresponsive, but to speak in terms of ratios is unbiblical. Christians do not need to "justify" their presence in areas where Christ is not known. They need simply to be "obedient."  The purpose of this paper is to briefly review a biblical rationale for continuing to focus on people groups who are not responsive and whose ministry environment constitutes risk to national and expatriate believers.  Our mandate is to go into all the world and give everyone a chance to hear clearly about Jesus Christ (Matt. 28:18-20).  Our methodology remains sending those "called to go" of God to the "nations," sent and supported by those "called to stay" by God to grow the existing church (Rom. 10:14- 21). Our resolve is to remain at the task until all nations/people groups/ethne have had a chance to hear. Often our team has been told, "You have done enough." It’s time to "shake the dust" off your feet and pull out.   Let us look at some appropriate Scriptures for a moment. There is a dire warning directed toward target recipients of witness found in Matthew 10:14, Mark 6:11, and Luke 6:5 in regard to Jesus, the sending out of the 12 disciples, the hearing of the gospel and the treatment of Christ’s emissaries. Here we notice:  Jesus sends his disciples to every town and village.  Serious consequences for rejecting both God’s message and messengers; "a warning."  The sending of the disciples to the Jewish people, a people who had revelation history, not a people group that had never heard!  The disciples were told to "shake the dust off their feet" if they or the gospel were rejected.  Jesus never withdrew his followers from a single people group. They were simply relocated/redeployed into the next village/town.   The only apostolic examples of "dusting" are found in Acts 13:50-51 and Acts 18:6. In the first, Paul was indignant at the Jews in Pisidian Antioch stirring up opposition to his preaching. However, he didn't dust off any other towns on this journey where he encountered similar Jewish-instigated persecution (Iconium and Lystra). And, he returned to Antioch to encourage the church there in Acts 14:21. In the second reference in Corinth, the dusting was a sign to the Jews that he was shifting his attention to the Gentiles.  In evaluating our efforts among the "dangerously unresponsive" one should seek to compare efforts to the commands and revelation found in Matthew 28 and Romans 10. To do otherwise, and in light of man’s desire to count heads and report numbers, could make us administratively correct while biblically disobedient. Recently an influential mission leader was reported as having said, "As long as Somalia and other countries are unresponsive and dangerous, I will use all my influence to pull us out of these places." This comment is representative of many who would trade away the provision to give all peoples a chance to hear about Jesus for factors like response, cost, or security. It is not time to pull out of places like Somalia or people groups that have had little or no chance to hear and believe. The people group has not rejected Christ or his messengers. They have not heard clearly concerning Jesus and his gospel.  In 1992, I commented to Dr. David Barrett that "The Somalis were not responsive to the gospel of Jesus Christ." Quickly he chastened me. In essence he replied, "You cannot say that they are unresponsive. They have never had a chance to respond." Somalis have rejected U.N.-led interventions, the West, and a false, preconceived idea of Christianity. They have not rejected Christ or his message. In specific areas where Somalis and others have killed Christ’s followers we must honestly and biblically struggle with God’s will in regard to expatriate presence. Did the Jews as a people group reject Jesus by killing the Christ? In Matthew 28, did Jesus therefore tell his disciples to "shake the dust off their feet" and leave Jerusalem? No. He sent them back. Why? It’s clear (to me) that the Jewish people flocked to Jesus. It was the Jewish leadership, the "keepers of the keys," who had Jesus crucified.  Who decides when the dust is to be shaken off? Jesus as the spiritual administrative leader of the 12 disciples drew definite and clear parameters. But he then left the decision of when to leave to the Spirit-led judgment of those he had sent out. That decision was done by those "on site" within the parameters clearly set by Jesus, with further discernment to come only by faith, prayer, and fasting (Matt. 17:20, Mark 9:29, and Luke 9:37). Here, also, is seen the anger and heartbreak of Jesus. His disciples, because of a lack of faith, prayer, and fasting, were not capable of staying the course and accomplishing the harder tasks.  Again, who decides when enough is enough? I believe that Jesus gives us the parameters. Biblically the dust is shaken off when either Christ’s people or his gospel are rejected. Dusting is tactical, not strategic; it is not a permanent decree—perhaps after a community has been dusted off, it can be returned to in a year, decade, or whenever, as the Spirit leads. Dusting is a public protest against hard hearts, particularly from people who know the Scriptures. Prayers based on such Scriptures as 1 Corinthians 16:9; 2 Corinthians 2:12-13, and 2 Thessalonians 3:1-2 are very appropriate for frequent use by those working among the dangerously unresponsive, including communities that have been dusted off. If Christ’s gospel has not clearly been shared, then discernment and staying power are required. Every effort must be made to get the gospel among the cities, towns, and villages, circumventing those who benefit from the status quo. Jesus indeed called out the harvesters of the harvest in Matthew 9:35-38. But he did so in light of the cross and as "sheep among wolves" (Matt. 10). Is it not clear that even real harvest and persecution go hand in hand? Westerners sometimes give the impression that what is desired is to be sheep among sheep or wolves among wolves. Is the impression also given that we do not (1) accept persecution and a lack of harvest or (2) accept persecution and harvest but (3) we are only content with a harvest in the absence of persecution? Where is harvest and life-threatening persecution going hand in hand? Persecution was the New Testament norm, not the exception, in both environments of rejection and harvest. Harvest without persecution may be suspect in light of the New Testament witness. Perhaps this leads to the old adage that Christianity in many places is a "mile wide and an inch deep."  Paul was to be a model, if not the model, for today’s missionary endeavor. Yet he had to escape from Damascas (Acts 9:23) and disagreed with Barnabas (Acts 15:37-39). He was charged with treason (Acts 18:13), imprisoned in Philippi, stripped naked and beaten (Acts 16:16ff.), arrested in Jerusalem (Acts 21:27) and imprisoned twice in Rome (Phil. 1:19-21).  As a student of modern missions, I respectfully observe that many mission sending agencies would have recalled Paul and told him early on to shake the dust off his feet, stay only with the nonpersecuting harvest areas, and "come home, you have done enough."  Thank God that did not happen. But staying the course did cost Paul his life and it must have broken the heart of the sending churches back home.

       Nairobi, October 9, 2003 (Catholic Information Service for Africa) - The Bishop of Djibouti Msgr Giorgio Bertin has narrated how veteran refugee helper Dr Annalena Tonelli was killed.   Bishop Bertin who is also the Apostolic Administrator of Somalia said that Dr Annalena was shot at close range by a man who was waiting for her at around 8:30 pm on Sunday October 5, 2003, within the hospital compound as she was going home.  "In effect Annalena had been threatened several times in the past, I made a photocopy of the two threat papers," he said.  The prelate expressed his fears that nobody may be found to continue the work of the slain doctor.  "She had only assistants, nobody who could be considered her deputy or who could replace her," said bishop Bertin.  Immediately after she had been shot, she was taken into the hospital and the doctors tried to save her life. Although many people present offered their blood for her, the bullet that had hit her was fatal and she died while undergoing treatment.  Bishop Bertin confirmed that the police have arrested several people in connection with the murder, but no certainty has been reached concerning the killer.  Only five days after she was killed, her absence was already being felt in the community.  "There is the problem of paying salaries of some of her workers for the end of the month of September," the bishop feared. "Probably also the rent of the house of Annalena for the month of September ($200 per month) is to be paid. What will happen to the TB hospital without her?" he wondered.  Doctor Annalena was also working with helpers from neighboring Kenya.  The bishop said that some teachers had only come from Kenya to help her two days before she met her death.

      August 1996  By A. Modhiso Africanews    In spite of the intolerance from their Muslim counterparts, the Christians in Somalia are very hopeful that one day they shall proclaim their faith in Christ without risking their lives. The Catholic bishop of Mogadishu gives a briefing on the situation of the church in Somalia.     At the age of 50, Msgr.. Giorgio Bertin, the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Mogadishu is a rare kind of bishop to find. He is a bishop in a country with hardly ten native Christians, let alone Catholics.  However, a glance at the involvement of the church in the development of Somalia, the soft spoken Mons. Bertin can be described as a bishop for all the Somali people. "Even though there are few Christians in Somalia, the Church is alive in practically every sphere of life in this country", comments Mons. Bertin. Through its humanitarian wing, Caritas, the Catholic Church, in conjunction with other Non-Governmental Organisations, is actively involved in the reconstruction of schools and hospitals among other development projects.  Asked why the Church does not involve itself in pastoral activities, Bertin said, "it is very difficult for the church to have pastoral work when it (Church) is not officially recognised." "Being a Christian could mean death to a local Somali. To follow Christ means risking ones life in this predominantly country," adds the bishop.   Although the diocese of Mogadishu covers the whole geographical area of Somalia (637,657 square kilometres), the bishop's work is mainly concentrated in Somaliland, with a population of about one million people. Somaliland was proclaimed a new country in May 1991, when the rebel Somali National Movement (SNM) declared the secession of northern Somalia, naming its leaders, Abd Ar- Rahman Ali Tur as its first president. With Hargeisa as the capital, the new nation has however, failed to win international recognition.  Following the secession and subsequent inter-clan fighting that ensued, refugees poured across borders to neighbouring countries in their thousands. Ethiopia alone took upto 500,000 refugees while Kenya and Djibouti absorbed 300,000 and 15,000 respectively. Another 65,000 sailed across the Red Sea to Yemen. At home thousands of people died each day despite the massive relief effort that was gathering momentum. Trigger-happy soldiers begun to loot relief supplies and seize food for themselves.  The magnitude of the meyhem prompted the resignation of the UN official in charge of the relief effort, Mohammed Shanoun, citing lack of support from New York. The international body proved incapable of protecting the relief workers or supplies. Up till the present moment, neither Somalia nor the self- proclaimed Somaliland has enjoyed peace and calm. Even after the recent death of the famous warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed of the United Somali Congress (USC), inter-clan fighting has not ceased.  Asked why he thought Aideed's death would not mean sure peace Mons. Bertin said, "I've always told the Somalis never to demonize Aideed so much. The local people are also to blame for the mess of their country. It is not only the work of a single leader". Aideed died in early August of injuries received in a clan fighting in areas controlled by his forces. He has since been succeeded by his 32-year old son, Hussein Mohamed Aideed,who has vowed to reclaim more territory, dashing any hope for peace in the troubled horn of Africa country. According to Mons. Bertin, Somalia could be subdivided into twelve different areas controlled by different clans, an indication that escalation of clan animosity could mean more meyhem.  Although the new government in Somaliland led by Mohamed Ibrahim Igaal, the successor of Ali Tur, proclaims freedom of religion, in practice it is contrary.  "I can only say mass in individual houses of foreign NGO workers. Even if the Church in Hargeisa has been rebuilt, no local Christian would feel free to attend mass there", said the bishop. He also observes that Sharia law (Islamic laws) was to be adopted but this has not been implemented so far.

        7/23/2003     [ENI] Leaders of Somalia's small Christian community attending talks in Nairobi have expressed concern about the plight of Christians in their troubled country.   "We live in constant fear. We have very little rights, since people believe that there are no Christians in Somalia," said Peter Ahmed Abdi, leader of the Mogadishu Pentecostal Church, who is also chairman of the tiny Somali Christian community.   Leaders and warlords of more than 20 fighting factions, as well as traditional and religious leaders such as Abdi, have gathered in the Kenyan capital for the Somali National Reconciliation Conference sponsored by the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, which comprises countries in East Africa and the Horn of Africa. They are trying to reach agreement on an interim government for Somalia.   Somalia slid into anarchy without a stable government after the overthrow of the Siad Barre regime in 1991. The breakaway, self-proclaimed independent Republic of Somaliland in the northern part of the country is not recognised by any government.   Somali Christians were demanding the right to worship and assemble, to move freely and to have political representation, said Abdi, who was accompanied in the talks by two Roman Catholics. He said he had been shouted down at the conference by Muslim delegates, who had insisted Somalia had no Christians.   Somalia's few Christians are being oppressed and living in fear of being killed, Abdi said. "We do not walk openly proclaiming our faith because we can be assassinated anytime. We pray on Fridays in Somalia just like [Muslims], since they will not allow us to attend church on Sunday." Church structures erected in colonial times and shortly after the country's independence have collapsed.   Somalia is virtually 100 per cent Muslim, according to the World Christian Encyclopedia, with only about 200 Somali Catholics and small groups of Protestants associated with Mennonite missionaries and the Sudan Interior Mission. "We are calling on Christians from all over the world to help [rebuild] our churches," said John Muktar, a Somali Roman Catholic.

      Carabtu Islaamka hortiis waxay u qaybsanayd Carab Carab ah, Carab Carabowday iyo Carab Iscarabaysay.  Mowjaddii koowaad ee carabtu (Carab carab ah) waxay ahayd qabaa'ilkii reer Caad, reer Samuud, iwm.   Mowjaddii labaad (Carab Carabowday) ee aan asal ahaan carab ahayn, ha yeeshee caraboobay kedib markii reer Caad iyo reer Samuud eebbe xasuuqay, waxay ahaayeen qabaa'ilkii Yamanta ee reer Qaxdaan.   Mowjaddii saddexaad ee carabtu waa tii ayadu iscarabaysay ayaga oo ku dayanaya kuwii ka horreeyey ee caraboobay waana qabaa'ilkii Cadnaaniyiinta reer Makka.  Haddaba kol hadday carabtii carabta ahayd dhammaatay waxa garoonka isugu soo haray carabtii carabowday (Qaxdaaniyiin) iyo tii iscarabaysay (Cadnaaniyiin). Waxa ay isku kala garan jireen calaamado iyo dhaqan u gaar ah qolo walba sida Qaxdaaniyiinta oo qaadan jiray cimaamado iyo calamo leh midabka jaallaha, halka cadnaaniyiintu ay ka qaadan jireen cimaamado iyo calamo casaan ah, waxana ka dhaxayn jirtay colaad aan weligeed dhammaan.  Qaxdaaniyiintu markay Yaman degeen Cadnaaniyiintuna waxay degeen Makka. Haddaba kolkii uu dumay biyaxireenkii MA'RIB 532 CD Waxa dhalatay boqortooyadii SABA', halkaasi oo Qaxdaaniyiin fara badani ka haajireen Yaman una guureen meelo kala duwan. Qaar kamid ah Qaxdaaniyiintii Yaman ka haajiray waxay degeen Madiina, waana labada qabiil ee OOWS iyo KHASRAJ. Qaar kale waxay ku kala firdheen meelo kale oo kamid ah Jasiiradda Carabta iyo Suuriya.  Inkasta oo Islaamku uu babi'iyey waxa qabiilka la yiraahdo oo qabilladii oo dhan uu isugu geeyey ummad keliya, misna colaaddii iyo cadaawadii u dhaxaysay reer Qaxdaan iyo reer Cadnaan ma ayan dhammaan, waxanay sabab u noqotay masiibooyin badan oo markii dambe ku habsaday Carabta iyo Islaamka. Qaxdaaniyiintu waxay isu haysteen inay ka reer magaalsan yihiin Cadnaaniyiinta, waxanay ugu yeeri jireen "Qamiisyooley" iyagoo ku cayn jiray inay reer baadiye yihiin qamiisyada lebbista, halka Qaxdaaniyiintu iyagu ay ka lebbisan jireen dharka reer magaalka iyo waxyaabaha la isku qurxiyo intaba. Cadnaaniyiintu iyagu waxay Qaxdaaniyiinta ku cayn jireen inay "Qodato" yihiin shaqadooduna tahay beero qodashada, xirfaddaasi oo markaasi reer Cadnaan ula muuqatay wax ceeb ah oo mudan ruuxii ku shaqaysta in la yaso.  Kolkii ay billowdeen furitaannadii Islaamku casrigii khaliifkii Cumar bin Khaddaab (RC), Islaamku wuxuu ku fiday dalalka Shaam, Masar, Afrikada waqooyi (Liibiya, Tuuniisiya, Aljeeriya iyo Marooko). Masar waxa uu Islaamku uga sii gudbay Suudaan. Guud ahaan, dalalkaasi ma aanay ahayn carab, ha yeeshee kolkii ay diinta Islaamku gaartay bay luqada carabiga ka dhigteen luqadooda rasmiga ah, yeesheenna Saqaafad (Dhaqan + Aqoon + Luqad) carbeed, sidaasi bayna ku noqdeen mowjaddii afaraad ee carbeed, carabtaasi cusub oo markaasi loo bixiyey Carab Saqaafadeed.  Ummadihii kale ee Islaamka galay sida; Furus (Iiraan), Tattaar (Jamhuuriyadaha Aasiyada dhexe), Muslimiintii Hindiya, Maleeshiya, Indooniisiya, iwm., ma aanay qaadan luqada carabiga, balse waxay sii haysteen luqadohoodii hooyo ee asalka ahaa, halka dalalkii kale ee bariga dhexe; Shaam (Suuriya, falastiin iyo Lubnaan), Ciraaq, Masar, Suudaan iyo dalalka Afrikada waqooyi luqada carabigu ay kaga noqotay luqadoodii hooyo oo ay si wadajir ah ugu wada hadlaan dadka Muslimiinta ah iyo kuwa aan Muslimiinta ahayn ee dalalkaas ku nool dhammaan. Taa micneheedu waxa weeye in carabnimada saqaafaddu keentay ay teendhada carbeed soo wada gelisay dadyow aan ayagu asal ahaan markii hore carab ahayn kana dhana saddexdii mowjadood ee carbeed ee aynu soo tilmaannay. Dadyowga caynkaas ah waxa kamid ahaa Aashooriyiin, Kancaaniyiin, Fiinaqiyiin, Faraaciin, Nuubiyiin, Suudaaniyiin iyo Barbariyiin ku kala noolaa dalalkii Islaamku gaaray.  Haddaba aynu si caqli iyo xikmadi ku jirto isu weydiinno eh Soomaalidu waa carabtee?. Kol haddaanay reer Caad iyo reer Samuud ka soo jeedin ama reer Qaxdaan iyo reer Cadnaan amaba ahayn mowjaddii afaraad ee luqada dhaqanka iyo aqoonta carbeed qaadatay sidaana ku carabowday lana baxday carab saqaafadeed, xaggaynu ku carabownay?, maxaynu ku carabownay?, goormaynuse carabownay?.  Luqadu ma aha oo qura aalad loo adeegsado in la isku afgarto, balse waxa weeye buundo ay saqaafaddu ugu kala gudubto dadyowga luqadaasi ku hadla, waana dhaqan saameeya qofka shakhsiyaddiisa iyo hab dhaqankiisa guud, waana taa tan dadyowga carbeed (Muslin iyo Masiixi intaba) ka dhigtay kuwo isku dhaqan iyo caadooyin ah. Sharshal kolkii uu Masaarida ka warbixinayey waxa uu tilmaamay in aanu wax farqi ahi u dhaxayn qofkooda Muslinka iyo kooda Qibdiga ah aan ka ahayn in mid Masjidka galo kan kalena Kaniisadda. Sharshal waxa uu warbixintiisa uga jeeday in dhaqanka, caadooyinka iyo guud ahaan saqaafadda dadka Masaarida ahi diintay doonaan ha haysteene isku mid tahay.   Haddaba, carab ma sheegan karaa qof aanay hooyadii erey carabiya aqooni?. Maxay isku difaacayaan dadka carabta inagu daray kolka la weydiiyo maxaynu carab ku noqonnay?. Miyaanay inooga sharaf roonayn inaynu niraahno waxaynu nahay dal Islaam ah sida dalka adduunka ugu Islaamka badan (Indooniisiya) oo ay ku nool yihiin in ka badan laba boqol oo milyan oo Muslimiin ahi. Sida Maleeshiya, Bakistaan, Turkiga, Iiraan, iwm. Xiriirka naga dhexeeya annaga iyo carabtu miyaanu ku habboonayn inuu ahaado mid ku dhisan diinta Islaamka kol haddaynaan isku dhaqan iyo luqad midnaba ahayn. Markan hadalkaa leeyahay anigu qof ahaan waxan afka carabiga wax ku baranayey muddo koow iyo toban sano ah, waxanan carab la noolaa muddo fara badan, ha yeeshee imisa Soomaaliya ayaa ila mid ah oo sheegan karta inay carab ku saqaafad yihiin?. Miyaanay ceeb ahayn inaan carabnimo sheegto hooyaday oon "Kaalay" Af-Carabi ku oran karin?.   Mulsimiintu kolkay furteen degeenna dhulkii "Andalus" la oran jiray (Koofurta Isbeyn) inay ku midoobaan dareenkoodii diineed iskaba daaye waxay ku kala tageen dareenkii qabyaaladeed. Waxay u kala jajabeen qolooyin, madaxa qolo walibana waxa uu isku magacaabay inuu boqor qoladiisa u yahay. Halkii bay qolooyinkii carbeed caydii, cadaawadii iyo colaaddii kasii wadeen iyada oo qolo waliba ay ku caynayso tan kale reer baadiyenimo ama qodatonimo. Cadaawadaasi joogtada ah iyo dagaalkaasi aan dhammaanayn ee u dhexeeyey ummadda Islaamku waxay fursad siiyeen Isbaanishkii inay qolaba mar jebiyaan ilaa ay ugu dambeyntii jebiyeen boqortooyadii Garanaada, Muslimiintiina ku soo celiyeen galbeedka Afrika kedib markay siddeed boqol oo sano ka talinayeen Andalus.  Qofka taariikh yaqaanka ahi waa kan garanaya siduu u saameyn lahaa taariikhda lafteeda. Qofka si cilmiyeysan u darsa dhacdooyinka taariikhiga ahina waa kan awood u yeesha inuu naftiisa ka xoreeyo qoolal iyo silsilado fara badan oo ku xirxirnaa, awoodiisana u jiheeyo inuu ku qabto waxyaabo faa'iido u leh ummaddiisa iyo asaga laf ahaantiisa intaba.  Guntii iyo gunaanadkii, waxaan ummadda Soomaaliyeed iyo waxgaradkeeda kula talin lahaa inay ku dadaalaan laba umuurood: Tan hore, Inay ku hoos midoobaan dalladda diinta Islaamka kana xoroobaan kala qoqobka iyo qolo-qolada, kuna cibra qaataan wixii ku dhacay dadyowgii iyaga ka horreeyey waddada ay iminka hayaan qaaday, qolada iyo qabiilkana qaaya mooday. Tan labaad, inay ku faanaan diintooda Islaamka iyo dadnimadooda Soomaalinnimo, kana koraan tabaciyada iyo carab kadaba cararka, hadday carabi khayr leedahay iyadaa wax isku fali lahayd eh.

SOMALI CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY MINORITY   FROM: SOMALIA CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY   TO: KENYA’S SPECIAL ENVOY TO SOMALIA   SUBJECT: CHRISTIAN INCLUSION IN THE SOMALIA NATIONAL RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE – ELDORET    This is to inform you that the above named is for the peace of the Nationa of Somalia.The Somalia Christianity Community has faced many difficulties in their country and as you are aware it is God who is holding the universal so if we are not included in the Government it will be difficulty for the peace which many are looking for to be found. God is the prince of peace.    Note that:If we are not included in the parliament, it will be difficult for us to be in the land of Somalia and this will force us to leave the country.   The Somalia constitution started in 1960 when we got independence up to now the constitution states that every Somalia has freedom of religion.   For a long time Christians have been represented in the Parliament as M.Ps and ministers e.g. Antony Mariama, Michael Maariama and others including myself.   We are fighting for the right of all the people even Kenyans because Christians are pillars of peace.   We are looking forward to have three members of Parliament in the Somalia Government one of them to Dr. Ahmed Abde Ahmed.   Finally this is what God is saying to the people of Somalia.      2 Chronicles 7:14   If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and leave and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.

       By Cali Nuur    Growing up as a lad in the Somali inhabited area of "NFD" I remember the term "gaalo" being used to differentiate Somali Muslims from their animists, Christians and pagan neighbours. The occasional white man who visted that peripheral region was referred to as "fariinji" or "cadaan". In essence, a white man who is born or converted to the Islamic faith was addressed as "Fariinji", a black borana who practised paganism with gods such as Waaq were referred to "gaal".  However, coming to Somalia as a young man and later, in a life marked by exile I interacted with many of my Somali brethren. To my dismay, these Somalis defined the concept of gaalosim using ethnicity. In many instances, a black pagan is not called a "gaal" but "madow" while a white Muslim would always be a gaal. But that is not the aim of this article. My aim with this short article is to highlight the double standards that my people, Somalis, Practice.  In the later part of the fifties, when independence was knocking on our doorsteps, many of our parents and grandparents lived in the countryside pursuing nomadic life. The British and Italian colonists were anxious to leave power to a few greedy henchmen who would enhance the cultural and intellectual colonisation of our people. Many older and wiser men that I have spoken to have revealed that the words "alore, governo" etc was enough to acquire a political position. In the northern part, things were different. The British were reported to have invested in Institutions of higher education. Instead of scholars Somaliland also sent brutish lackeys to Xamar!. One common feature, however, was these new leaders were secularists; latent gaalos who smoked pipes, talked and walked like gaalos- Almost a half-century later, in the diasporas from London to Toronto, we are witnessing how Somalis are marginalized. On a recent visit to London which is reportedly to be home over 200 000 Somalis, I was surprised to learn of the modern day exodus of Somalis from continental Europe. This new wave of Somalis did not escape from the persecution of warlords, civil war or from dictatorship. They fled "GAALO". Apparently, many European countries have devised laws that specifically aim to target Somalis; FGM debate in Scandinavia, daily racist remarks by politicians who see Somalis as a threat to democracy, hard to integrate (in actual sense they mean assimilation) or in some cases equating Somalis with primitivism- not fit to live among the human race.  In towns such as Toronto, Birmingham, Ohio, London and Minneapolis, you have certainly seen Somali women who wear the "Xijaab" or girls who wear jeans, revealing pants, -shirts but with a "xijaab"! Equally, you might have visited the many arenas including qaad houses, coffee houses, street parliaments where men discuss "GAALO". The same "gaalo" haters could sometimes be overheard supporting a certain warlord, or tribe. In the same token you might be aware that many Somalis in welfare states are over represented in the welfare beneficiary statistics; not to mention the many separation or marriage of conveniences that aim at increasing the GAALO income!  In my layman view, we have Somali "gaalos" whose features are: · They play the blame game when discussing Somali issues; you would meet them everywhere uttering words such as "Gaalada allaha ha naga qabto; waxaan gaalada ayaa ka dambeeysa". In most cases these Somali Gaalos slander the hand that feeds them by on the one hand living on social security, while on the other hand they have the time to sit/stand idly in the "street" parliaments and condemning the white Gaalo.  Warlords and their supporters. According to the Islamic faith to which many of us subscribe to Islam is a complete submission to Allah; including refraining from murdering women, children and men. Most of the Somali warlords are involved in massacres and only GAALOS are capable of some of the atrocities.   ALLOW GAALADA MADOOW NAGA QABO! E-mail: calinuur2@hotmail.com

        Nairobi, Jul. 16, 2003 (CWNews.com) - Somali Christian leaders have charged that Bishop Salvatore Colombo of Mogadishu, was killed in cold blood 12 years ago, at the order of the former government of President Siad Barre.   Members of the Somali Christian Community made the disclosure during a meeting of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference, being held in Nairobi, Kenya. The Christian representatives, who are still fighting for recognition as the talks that have brought together leaders of Somalia's many conflicting factions, told CWN that Bishop Colombo was killed after defying the Barre government on the purchase of land for an impoverished tribe.

        Excerpts    On 3 January 2004 a powerful Somali group Kulanka Culimada issued a statement in Mogadishu specifying that Somalia is 100% Islamic, that no other religion can be propagated in the country and that no Christians can hold any position in the government. In February 2003 they stated that all Somali Christians should be executed for apostasy, in line with shari’a.  Pray for the safety of the tiny but severely persecuted Somali Christian community. Please pray that God will continually guide, inspire and bless decision making regarding the pursuance of the Apostasy Campaign. Pray that more church, political and Muslim leaders will come out in support of reforming the apostasy law.

      Christianity Today, Week of September 5  'It was God who saved me,' Haji declares.  By Barbara G. Baker | posted 9/6/00 Yesterday, four days after they flew out of Yemen, Somali Christian convert Mohammed Omer Haji and his family arrived for permanent religious asylum in Auckland, New Zealand.  "This is a very far place here," a sleepy Haji told Compass by telephone today.  More than 24 hours after their arrival, the Somali refugee said he and his wife Sarah were still sleeping off the four marathon days and nights they had spent in planes and airports between Yemen and New Zealand. After the initial leg of their journey to the Eritrean capital of Asmara, they were routed through Jeddah, Bombay, Singapore and Sydney.  "Really it was God who saved me," the former Muslim told Compass. "I am happy that all the believers prayed for me everywhere, Christian people," Haji said. "It's a miracle that I am free."  Haji, 27, was released from a Yemeni prison in Aden on August 24, seven weeks after a local judge threatened to execute him for apostasy if he did not return to Islam. The case was halted in the courts after it was reported in the international press.  After extended negotiations with local representatives of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), under which Haji had official refugee status, the government of Yemen agreed to allow Haji and his family to be deported for resettlement elsewhere.  A refugee living in Yemen since 1994, the Somali had converted to Christianity two years ago and adopted the name George. He was first jailed last January by Yemeni security police, who reportedly beat him and tried for two months to coerce him to return to Islam. Haji was later rearrested and put on trial in June for apostasy, a capital offense under the strict Islamic law observed in Yemen.  "There is no religious freedom in Yemen," Haji commented. "Nobody knows about Jesus, and it's a sin to believe in Him."  The former Muslim had been given a one-week ultimatum at his July 5 trial to recant his faith in Christ and return to Islam, or face execution. Four days later, he told Compass, the judge at a closed-door July 9 hearing on his case offered to "give me everything I wanted" if Haji would come back to Islam.  "I don't want everything, I want Jesus Christ. I don't want anything else. If I die, I die with Jesus. He died for me and also for you," he said he told the judge. Although UNHCR staff were present at this hearing, Haji's court-appointed lawyer was neither informed nor invited.  According to the Somali refugee, one of the many miracles he experienced while in jail for his Christian faith was actually forgiving the Yemeni policeman who had beaten him the most. "That man, he beat me so much," he said. "But I forgive him, because of Christ."  Haji and his wife and son are being housed temporarily at the New Zealand Immigration Service's refugee resettlement center in Auckland. Several local churches have applied to sponsor the Haji's resettlement process since the New Zealand government offered the family asylum in late July.

      Khartoum, Aug. 27, 2003 (CWNews.com) - With a small Christian community in Somalia demanding the right to worship freely in the overwhelmingly Muslim country, a UN report has confirmed that the human-rights situation in the troubled African country is deplorable.   Representatives of Somalia's tiny Christian minority have been attending the Somali Peace Reconciliation talks, currently being held in Kenya, and seeking recognition for the Christian presence in Somalia. With the country now having suffered through more than a full decade of anarchy-- with the society controlled by rival warlords-- Christians have been forced underground to escape the notice of intolerant Muslim militia groups.

      22 November 2003  Walaal    waxan akhriyey qoraalkaagii ku saabsanaa dhibaatooyinka iyo laynta loo geystay xubnihii kaniisaddii Xamar ee sida qarsoodiga ah isugu iman jiray si ay Rabbigooda u caabudaan. Waxaad kale oo tilmaantay dhacdooyin dhowaanahan ah,  Waan ka naxay waxyaabahaas oo dhan. Hese yeeshee, Ilaah xaqaani ah baannu leenahay. Imtixaan bay innoo tahay.   Anigu  Yurub baan ku suganahay, sidaas oo ay tahay, mararka qaarkood waxan la kulmaa cay, habaar ama handadaad, si kastaba ha ahaatee uma baqanayo naftayda.   Ma garanayo inay suurta gal ii noqon doonto inaan Soomaaliya ku noqdo oo aan ehelkayga iyo qaraabadayda oo dhan u sheegi karo inaan Masiixi ahay. Sidaasi waa sida aan jeclahay – dhinaca kalese naftaydaan u baqayaa.  Aan u duceyno Soomaalida Masiixiyiinta ah meel kasta oo ay joogaan. Aan u duceyno Soomaalida oo idil in Ilaah mugdiga ka saaro oo tuso iftiinka hanuunka. Aan u ducayno ruux walba oo isku hawla wanaaggeenna iyo samatabixintenna.    Eebbe ha kula jiro oo ha ku barakeeyo.    Your brother in Jesus,  Hassan

      VERBATIM is where we share correspondences with Somali believers, many of them underground, from around the world. First names of the believers are used to protect their identity. Sometimes other identifying marks are edited, too.   We sometimes use pen names for our correspondents when we see it necessary.   This blog is one place where Somali believers can communicate with the wider world—may the Lord bless and protect them.  In the Name of Jesus, may his mercy and protection be upon us.
