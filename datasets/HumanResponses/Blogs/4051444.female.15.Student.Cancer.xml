       Music: Crazy In Love - Beyonc√©   Mood: Pissed &nbsp;   I was watching this Sci Fi movie last night and I can tell ya, I now have a new meaning for the word Paul. Paul = Sexilicious. The lead role was so hott, I couldn't get over it! But what sucked was that the movie was made in 1986, which meaas that the hott guy is way too old for me...so I can only dream...What really sucks tho is when you watch old movies like The Outsiders and one of the characters (Sodapop) is really hott, all you can do is dream because the movie is really old which means that the actor is way too old which means that you'd never have a chance with them anyways!

       For the past 20 minutes, I have been looking for ways to beat Doom II...I am utterly obsessed with the game...except for the Head On The Spike...that thing tripped me out..anyways. It turns out that the co-creator/Psycho Creep John Romero is the last Boss or whatever (I'm sounding awfully Geeky). Anyways, when you start the level (the last level, Icon of Sin) there is this voice, but you can't understand what it is saying unless you reverse it. Now how the hell would I even know where to begin to reverse it...geez Louise. Anyways, it says something like, "To beat the game, you must defeat me, John Romero". So obviously, that means that I have to go back and look at the Fuckin Head On The Spike again, which I have no intention of doing, so I will not be able to beat the game...unless I can do something else to beat it because clearly, the Head On The Fuckin Spike is not able to move. So I'm guessing I have to kill the huge wall that shoots over the boxes that turn into the monsters/aliens/robots/whatevers. But CLEARLY, you can't kill a fuckin wall...so CLEARLY, I CAN'T FINISH THE GAME. Which CLEARLY means that I have wasted numerous hours of my life cheating and shooting stupid monsters/aliens/robots/whatevers in a stupid game with stupid graphics when I could have been making cookies or doing something not to boyish/childish. It's all Peter's fault, he got me friggin hooked on that game...once I picked up that BFG 9000 I knew there was no turning back.

       So last night, I went over to Brian's Pad and we watched...Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones...and Hayden Christensen was in it, so it was gooooood. Um...Matt V, Steph, Geoff and Freeman (don't know that kid) were there, so it was a veddy veddy cool evening...I ran up and down Brian's steps outside...had POPCORN! OMFG it was amazing, I haven't had microwave popcorn for so long...
