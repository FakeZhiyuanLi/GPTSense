       Okay, that French thing is old now but ill still write it in French just english first cause now I can't even understand what I wrote. The grammar is a bit retarded but then again I only comprend 80% of what I wrote on those logs. Erm... hmmm. I am really really f****** bored. Phe rang for SOSE homework, then I rang Jayne, then I rang Kylie. Don't ask what about the ratings about MA32+. And now im on the net still bored. Wow i think i must be bored nearly all of the day.....except when i see wouter then im not bored anymore.....But I can extend on that later. Dammit crappy subjects at school tomorrow. Got the WORST elective, with the WORST people in it all those people who K*** and yeah all those other losers. Most of them are ok just most of them really piss me off. Woodwork is fun though cut my hand on the saw and umm some of the flesh on my fingers came off on the linischer or whatever it is, but it's all cool.     &nbsp;   L'ok, cette chose française est vieux maintenant mais la défectuosité l'écrivent toujours dans l'anglais juste français causent d'abord maintenant I can't comprennent même ce que j'ai écrit. La grammaire est un peu retardé mais de l'autre côté le comprend 80% de I seulement de ce que j'ai écrit sur ces notations. Hmmm d'Erm.... Je suis vraiment vraiment ****** de f ennuyeux. Phe a sonné pour le travail de SOSE, alors j'a sonné Jayne, puis j'ai sonné Kylie.Ne demandez pas que diriez-vous des estimations au sujet de MA32+. Et maintenant im sur le filet était ennuyeux toujours. Le défaut de la reproduction sonore i pensent je dois s'ennuyer presque tout le jour.....except quand je vois que le wouter puis im plus non alésé.....But que je peux me prolonger sur cela plus tard. Sujets crappy de Dammit à l'école demain. A obtenu le PLUS MAUVAIS électif, avec les PLUS MAUVAISES personnes dans lui toutes ces personnes qui *** de K et ouais tous ces autres perdants.La plupart d'entre eux est juste correct plus d'eux pisse vraiment j'au loin. Le boisage est amusement a cependant coupé ma main sur la scie et l'umm une partie de la chair sur mes doigts est venu au loin sur le linischer ou celui qui il est, mais it's tout frais.

       Heyz chacun....Maybe personne parle le français et les thats pourquoi personne veut commenter... mais de toute façon je ne m'inquiète pas ! Aujourd'hui était trop de très ennuyeux les maths etc.. La cuisine était bonne cependant... excepté la nourriture que nous avons faite sucé. Je me demande s'il y a n'importe quelles français qui passent réellement à blogger.com, meh que je ne m'inquiète pas vraiment.

            F  u  d  g    e        Is my new substitute for Fuc..... yeah you get the picture. Some-one once told me that when you swear you haven't nothing more intellegent to say, this is very true and leads to the fact that I have no intelligence. Because I swear A LOT. I have said Fudge about 100times in the last 3days, which is really bad, because I swear too much. I would say it's not my fault, but you know it just comes out. My family are not really very "reserved" in the way that they talk. In Aotearoa I swear even more than what I do in Australia which is A LOT, in fact it is HEAPS!!!! This is probably due to my families influence on my language.   WOW that actually sounded smart. Weird....... Also Fudge the actual candy is very nice and the best would have to be french vanilla fudge and chocolate fudge it is sooooo nice, like eating the most fattening thing on the planet. It is also a ticket to about 30 pimples the following day. Hope everyone feels a lot more informed about "fudge."

       Well,    Today was fairly interesting up until SOSE and then well everything went pear-shaped.   And then well, when I got home that's a different story.   Certain people blame me for things I haven't done and take my jokes WAY too seriously.   I mean common! How could, "I wont go to school for the rest of the year because I got into McRobs."   Generate so much anger?    I didn't intend people to get upset and I WAS joking, because failing year 8 wouldn't look very nice on my permanant record. How could people take that seriously? GET OVER IT, IT WAS LAST TUESDAY!      Anyway, All Blacks lost the rugby : (  AGAIN! Bloody useless. Is bloody swearing? I hope not! Oh wellz. All Blacks need a sharp kick up the back side. Because we are going to loose the tri-nations! Not cool.   By the way, vote for the all blacks on my poll and I will send you some money ^^.   Tax deductable to. Nah just jokes....

       I would just like to say that in my post "fierte de kiwi" I wrote "J'amortirai en français juste à la pisse Zoe, mais en français cet isn't une bonne idée parce que personne ne veut se débarquer une détention d'un interne." Or something of that nature. This in English means " I think I will write in French just to piss Zoe off, but this probably isn't a good idea as no-one wants to land themselves a detention from an intern." If you used an online translator to get the English translation it would not have been correct even if they translated the English into French themselves the translation of French into English is NEVER correct. Believe me I tried myself. I am sorry if I have offended anyone in any way, shape or form. and I was NOT bagging interns or trying to bag them, I don't bag interns I have never bagged interns and I never will. Because Zoe you said that you're doing a thesis? Well guess what...? My mum is doing one as well. So...... Therefore I think it is a good idea to write in a language everyone understands ANGLAIS! I mean ENLGISH. Sorry for any inconvenience .   Australian Exchange Student...(meg)

        Hey Everyone, I just to firstly congratulate everyone that did Rock Eisteddfod!! IT WAS AMAZING. B.S.C Did sooooo well at Rock Eisteddfod, we got a whole lot of awards as well. We did sooo well. There was a school there called Boort Secondary and when they said the name, I was thinking "where the fudge is Boort" but it's 1hours drive from Bendigo. Dad said it was near Hamilton. Which is NO WHERE near Bendigo. The one in New Zealand as well as the one in Victoria. There's was o.k but they got like every single award. It sucked there performance, no offence, the costumes were weird and there was way too many people on stage. But then again B.S.C only had 25people on stage. The best one was Tintern College there's was soooooo good, it was about Brazil and voo-doo dolls and soccer and Carnavale and stuff it was wicked. Ours was really good as well compared to other schools. I could hardly speak at the end of it from yelling out "Go Brunswick" too many times. Pacoe Girls did there's as well and I think Jenzi was there but I couldn't tell, I was too far away to see properly. It looked like her anyway. Our seat were pretty good, it would have really sucked sitting out the front because at our assembly when they performed our item I could not see anything because there were a whole lotta tall people sitting in front of me, it would have been like that sitting at the front, but where Katie and I were sitting it was kinda "tiered" seating so it didn't really matter if some-one tall sat in front of you. But overall it was FANTASTIC!!! The judges crapped on too long though after every performance, they just went on and on and on about the performances, I only listened when they were talking about Brunswick. But they should have had just one judge say what they thought instead of going through everyone, (there was 3 judges)  I am still sick and I feel like crap, Nan started crying on the phone when she found out I got into Maccy I can't believe it, why would you cry? Beats me. I've missed out on too many English lessons and I have no idea what Zoe is talking about at the hub about assignments and stuff. I have to ask her what shes talking about....

        Still bored,  What to do what to do..... Finished my woodwork assignment and it only took me about an hour to do!  w00t!~!      Sorry to everyone who voted on my poll about the rugby I changed the setting of my template and I accidentally deleted the poll. Oops, but I made another one, so you can still vote.    I am not at school today, because I am sick, I've only had about 1 cold this winter which is unusual because I am usually sick all winter. I still can't believe I got into Maccy.

       Ja Ja Feelin' Danke....   God knows what that means.   I am eternally happy, I have found some rugby buddies and they are both very very cool. They live near my nana which is also very handy and there dad is from Whangamomona, which is in New Zealand. Whangamomona is pronounced "Fongamomona". It's near Mt Taranaki. Most of my family live in Wellington or Dorkland(Auckland) but only the loaded ones live in Auckland. My grandparents used to live in Tolaga Bay on the East Coast, it was cool my nan had a wicked shop. Anyway, I best not talk about that too much or I might start getting upset, which is not healthy when you have a cold. Got to go and get some bread for my "one-eyed Egyptian" TAA TAA.   Meggie got into Maccy.....o.0 weird I don't remember doing the test.....HAHAHAHA Sorry trying to be like Lachlan with his LAME jokes.  urlLink http://www.macrob.vic.edu.au/

      I would just like to say firstly.. That whatever I post on a blogger I WOULD say in real life. I have never ever posted something that I wouldn't say to someone's face. Anyway....  All Blacks lost the rugby I am now going into deep depression. But it's not the end of the world! Because the All Blacks still won the bledisloe cup! AND we're going to kick Sth Africas bums. Oh well I don't care it's not like I can talk to anyone about rugby :( None of the girls watch it. All the guys go for some crappy AFL team. AFL sucks, it is very very very boring. Rugby is much better, I should go on a world tour preaching about rugby. Yes that's what I'll do. Oh and Kylie and Chloe got into McRobs!~!! Yay! Go you guys hope you do well and everyone MIGHT miss you... I didn't say they would just that I think they MIGHT. Nah they probably would.  Got to eat chocolate now.

       Ohh, I have finally written the Tournament script. It only took 1hour which was good, and Kate helped me which is even better! She's a bit high though..... It was a nice day today, hopefully it will start to be more warmer now. So sick of Winter. Phe, if your looking at this please post a blog so I can write heaps of annoying comments on yours, instead of having to be content with you writing on mine and me not being able to write in yours. I talked to some Dutch dude yesterday it was very weird. I couldn't slang cause he only knew like pfft... I dunno what they call it, "PROPER ENGLISH" maybe. I saw the most funniest thing in the library, you know how they've got a whole lot of phrasebooks for different countries from lonely planet. Well the library had an Australian phrasebook. It was sooo funny half the words in the book I'd never even heard before, I really truly feel sorry for any idiot who goes and actually uses the words from the phrase book. I feel a bit scared now, cause when we went to Europe I used some of the words form those lonely planet phrasebooks, I bet the locals are probably still laughing at some of the S*** I probably said. Ohh well. I don't care it was ages ago.      Anyone wanna join netball? Go to the link below...    urlLink http://www.netballvic.com.au/

        Wow, Can't Believe how addictive this Blogger thing really is! I want to add photos but well, it costs money, money that I do not have at the moment. But never mind. I have Netball on Mondays now instead of on Sunday mornings which really sucked there for a while. Imagine this getting up at the same time on Sunday (Dimanche) that you do on weekdays when you have to get to school. My netball starts at 9 and it's in like Niddrie or something it's at St Bernards and I think thats in Niddrie could be in Airport west though. Anyway I have to get up at about 7am cause I have to eat breakfast an hour before netball so I don't get a stitch on court. My mum AND my sister have to get up as well and while I'm at Netball they go off and eat McDonald's while I am working my ass off at training. INCROYABLE !!! But it's all cool because I hate MsDonalds, in fact I really really hate McDonalds... Anyway back to Netball, to make things worse half my team turns up and then most of the people on the team don't even get to play a practice match cause we don't have a full team. As if thats not enough we haven't won a game. The whole of last season we did not win one single game!! INCROYABLE!!! Bloody hell all I can say is we better win at least one, single, game this season or I will cry. It's NOT fair.  Right now that thats off my chest I have other things to talk about to. Friday was very boring, watching hockey and to make it worse it was in freezing temperature. Went to watch Rach's hockey match unfortunately for them they did not win. Themes beat them by 2 goals. The score 3-1. I hope I spelt Themes right. Maybe it's Thames. Bah, who really cares no-ones going to read this bloody blog anyway. Unless I give them my address then they have the opportunity to read it, which I strongly recommend they do, for my blogs are very interesting. NOT! (PAS!) Je n'aime pas le blogger. Sorry I have written in French again I can't help it I need to practice or else I'll forget it, if I was in one of Mr G's classes I could speak French and I wouldn't need to write blogs in French. But it is IMPOSSIBLE, because Mr G doesn't teach our class.

      G'day, So you think my grammar sucks Tom? Well you could be right. I really really suck at english. I'm am trying to do a script... I cannot think of anything to do. Luckily Kate is smart and she will think of something.  Today has been o.k. My sister is the BIGGEST pain in the bum, she cries at the smallest thing, "Meggie, you won't give me chips, WAA WAA WAA." Bah, I do not care. I have to do a stupid woodwork assignment to which really sucks. Then my Science game needs finishing, and god knows what else I've probably forgotten half the stuff I'm suppose to do. Ohh S***E Maths...DAMMIT... I better do some work i suppose.... TA TA
