      I'm walking through Union Square Park this morning. Headphones on. Donovan's "Where is She?" comes on. It becomes this amazing soundtrack for walking lethargically through the park. Everthing's in slow motion. And I'm looking at the people on the benches. It's all surreal. These faces. These blank, tragic faces. Stone faces. Faces of madness, especially this cigarette smoke-wrinkled woman, heavy eyeliner, defeated and staring at dogs and smoking. The guy with palms pressed together chanting... And me still walking slow, because it's the way I feel. And Donovan walks with me...

      "It's not that I hate people, I just like it better when they're not around." - Bukowski  My favorite line from the film "Barfly."   And on nights like tonight that line resonates like cattlecars crossing sidecreeks...whatever that means. Let me see if I can explain it further...  So tonight I hit the Holiday... Lots of kids in the joint. Loud, obnoxious fuckers who play classic rock on the jukebox. Granted, I can appreciate the Stones. And I'd like to thank the individual who played "Let it Loose," which I think is almost as great as that Bukowski line. But a man can only take so much greatest hits of the Doors, CCR, Tom Petty and the like... And I'd also like to thank the individual who played Nick Cave's "Into My Arms." But unfortunately all these loud fuckers were ruining the song for me.  All right, yeah, I know I sound I'm bitching and whatnot, but there are times where I don't mind people being loud and having a good time and all that shit. But I just wasn't digging it tonight.   Anyway, then these fuckers come in and sit a seat down from me. And they're talking all sorts of bullshit... And that's when the next and shoulders started tightening up. The jaw starts tighening up. Suddenly all these voices start to get louder. And I'm trying to figure out which one of these guys should have his face smashed into the bar first. But I take a few deep breaths, finish my round and vacate.   Then on the L train more madness. I've got the headphones cranked and I can still hear this chick talking to this guy right next to me. And I'm thinking, Jesus, she's six inches from the guy. Does she have to talk so loud? Hell, I just want to listen to Tom Waits in peace. And the train's packed. And the time it takes to get from 1st Ave. to Bedford seems like hours. But at Bedford a lot of people clear out. Another deep breath.   So now I'm back at the crib. Listening to Erik Satie. Neck and shoulders still tight as fuck. I'm trying to decompress. And writing this is helping cut through all the madness. I just needed to get this shit out before I go to sleep...

      I've been itching to hear some Buck Naked and the Bare Bottom Boys lately. Damn, I wish I still had the CD. Great stuff. If anybody knows how to get a copy of the CD I'd greatly appreciate it. And if you haven't heard these porno-billy cats, try to track down the CD. Unfortunately Buck was shot and killed in Golden Gate Park while walking his dog about 10 years ago.

      Hell, now I'm starting to think that I shoulda just called this fuckin' thing "Girls and Subways" or something. It's all I'm writing about so far...  And I guess I should keep the theme rocking with some more girls I saw at the 1st Ave. L stop tonight.  So it's around 1 am. I'm waiting for the train. My face is feeling greasy from the humidity and sweating all goddamned day. Yeah, I know I'm a sweaty bastard from time to time, but today I was extra sweaty because it the hottest, most humid day in months... Anyway, I was waiting for the L. Waiting a long time. But it didn't matter because I was standing near the stairs. All these legs started walking down the stairs. But the first pair of legs I see to really get me was this gal who really knew how to work them. Pink high heels. And this funky black with pink designs getup that showed a lot of leg. And she had that strut. I don't know, sorta like a stripper strut or something.   Then she's waiting near the edge of the platform. She's doing that thing that chicks do where they've got one hip higher than the other, really flexing the legs. And all the guys are checking her and all that bullshit. Then the train going the other way comes and makes her little skimpy one-piece get-up blow around,exposing more thigh.  She's reading the Voice. Then a section of the paper falls on the ground. She waits a few moments. And in those few moments I imagine I'll she'll pick it up. I imagine her bending over, legs stretched, exposing panty and all that. But she kind of squats, picks up the pages and puts them in the trash can.  Then there's the girl reading the latest New Yorker. She's got black jeans on. Black halter top. Black bra straps sticking out. Labyrinth Book Shop bag hanging from her left shoulder. She has lovely shoulders. And I'm thinking how I'd prefer with a girl with lovely shoulders who reads the New Yorker to that chick with the legs who reads the Voice.   Then I start thinking how none of this really matters since I'd probably never have the balls to talk to either one of them...

      I was on the G Train again last night. And I've always disliked this fucking train because I've got to wait a long time. Probably the worst damn line in the NYC subway system. The only train that doesn't run into Manhattan. But what sucks is that it's the closest one to my crib.   Anyway, I'm on the train and this girl gets on. Blonde. Reminds a bit of Julie Delphy in "Before Sunrise." Incidentally, I'm reading a story about the sequel to that movie called "Before Sunset."   I had the headphones on, maybe Tindersticks. I heard the conductor say something, but I didn't catch it. Turns out the train was running express. I've never been on the G when it ran express. But they've been doing a lot of track work or something lately and it's been fucking things up, making the wait a lot longer.   So we're passing all these stops and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. The blonde stands up after a few stops. She looks confused. She walks over in front of me and asks me a question. I don't hear her. I take my headphones off and ask her to repeat what she just said. She asked what the next stop. Turns out it was Bedford-Nostrand. We've passed her stop.   So we both get off the train. She goes up the stairs and I see her coming down the stairs on the opposite platform. And it was one of those slow motion moments. One of those moments if it was in a film there would be some really cheesy music playing while the guy sees the girl of his dreams walking down the stairs. She's pulled up long skirt a bit while she walks down the stairs. And I'm awestruck by this situation. Now see, if she would've had a short skirt on, it wouldn't have worked at all. But the fact that she had a long skirt on and she was pulling it up, showing her knees, calves and ankles. Man, it was magical.   Then she's got her back to me. And I think I see the tag on her panties through the skirt. The skirt comes down to just above her ankles. And dammit, she has wonderful ankles. The backs of the ankles were sculpted and streamlined. Wonderful.

      The Girl With the Magic Legs  So I get on the Q Train this morning. I sit down. I look across from me and see this boots. A slight variation on go-go boots. Black boots that go up almost to the knee. Then I look at the knees. Wonderful knees. Then the thighs. Magical thighs. Short skirt. Jesus, this was all to maddening for me.   I was terrified to look at the rest of her. So I get out Bukowski's "Notes of a Dirty Old Man" and I try to read. But I can't read. I just use the book as an excuse to look at her knees and thighs. I mean, I'm trying to appear as if I'm reading. Hell, I didn't want to seem like the full-on perv. And even though I'm a bit of a perv I like to keep it myself. I don't like to stare. A guy can't be to obvious. I like to be sly when I'm looking...  Anyway, I just keep glancing at the words on the page. Then the quick peeks at the magic legs. I finally get the courage to look at her face. On first glance I think she has the face of a librarian. Maybe it was the glasses. The face didn't seem to go with the rest of her body and outfit. But somehow it all worked. And with each quick glance at her face, the more sexy she became.   At one point she pulls back her skirt a bit and scratches her thigh. That magical thigh. Then the crossing of her legs. All of this maddening. Meanwhile, I'm thinking that this is the kind of woman I could look at for long periods of time. I'd go 10 subway stops past mine just to look at those thighs, knees and boots. I'd come in an hour late for work. Jesus, anything to look at the legs.  At the trains pulls into the Canal Street stop she uncrosses her legs. She's ready to get up. She starts digging through her purse, which gives me longer time to look at her. And I can almost see up skirt. The train stops. Just before she gets up, she opens her legs just a tiny bit and I was incredibly close to getting a panty shot. So close it was maddening.   Although I was going to get off at the next stop, I consider getting off at Canal Street to follow her and look at the legs and the rest of her. But I decide against it. I would have much rather had her sit directly across from me so I could look those magic legs. And not hordes of guys on the street looking at those legs...

      Please bear with me while I try to get this bitch rockin'... I'm starting fresh here. New blog name, same demented writer. Something was tell me I needed bust out from under that Bukowski shadow that I've been lurking in.   And as a wise man one said, "We already have one Bukowski. Do we need more?"

      Just came across a mighty fine  urlLink site  dedicated to the world of wacky album covers. Was especially pleased to find a few Little Marcy covers in the mix, including this one:       For those of you who don't know about Little Mary, get thee to the  urlLink Marcy Zone  immediately.

      Sometimes I try to figure out who's more mildly insane - me or the rest of the world... Yeah, it's trite horseshit. But I think about it sometimes. And maybe "mildly" is too mild of a word. Hell, just plain insane is more like it. Then, at times like this I put on "Pet Sounds" and grasp for clarity. Maybe I'm grasping for clarity. Maybe I don't where the fuck this going... And sometimes that's a good thing.   Now I can the TV upstairs. Most of the sound is travelling through the vent near my kitchen, which I'd imagine connects the to the kitchen upstairs... There's a lot of screaming, gunshots and bullshit. I think I need to put the headphones on, maybe some "Pet Sounds" and sleep.

      Not a lot shakin' lately. No bigtime action, ya know. Sure, there's the daily checking out chicks on the subways and all that bullshit, but it really gets boring to write about (and probably read about) after a few times. But hell, every day it's a search, man. Looking for something. What, I'm not sure.   Oh yeah, something I forget to mention was seeing urlLink  A Skin Too Few , a Nick Drake documentary that recently played at Cinema Village in NYC. It wasn't a bad film. And while I did learn a few more thinks about Nick, I felt like the director could've tried a bit harder. Granted, the guy didn't have much to work with as far as video goes, but I think he could've interviewed more people. Paul Weller talked briefly about how Nick influenced him and whatnot, but he was the only musician interviewed. Nick influenced a hell of a lot of people...

      Found these scribbled in a notebook, not sure what it means. Might have been written down while watching "American Splendor":   “On the Sunny Side of the Street”   I’d be glad to trade some girl for happiness.   The eyebrows.   Hamburger station in Akron. Fresh fries.   Glued down coat together… looked like pigeon droppings.   Average is dumb.   You should try believing in something bigger than yourself.   Theodore Dreiser – “Jennie Gerhardt.”  Just keep on looking, something’s bound to turn up.

         I just came across a recent Uncut Magazine devoted solely to The Clash. A wealth of articles that span the history of the band. There's a three-part story by Lester Bangs that origanally appeared in NME, which I thought was especially cool. Here's a bit I found quite interesting:  "Joe kills the dull van hours with Nazitrocity thrillers by Sven Hassel, Mick is just about to start reading Kerouac's The Subterraneans but borrows my copy of Charles Bukowski's new book Love is a Dog From Hell instead, which flips him out, so next two days he keeps passing it around the van, trying to get the other guys to read certain poems like the one about the poet who came onstage to read and vomited in the grand piano instead (and woulda done it again too)."  The bit about puking in the piano would later turn up on the Big Audio Dynamite song "Hollywood Boulevard."

      Down at 81 again. Well, it's the first time in a week. I'm trying not to make it too much of a habit. And for a Sunday, a wonderful place to be. After the Nets game was over, I put the following on the jukebox  Downtown - Tom Waits I Love Paris - Screamin' Jay Hawkins Who's Makin' Love - Lou Donaldson Requiem por un con - Serge Gainsbourg Baby Scratch My Back - Slim Harpo When Will the Blues Leave - Ornette Coleman Know Your Rights - The Clash It's Raining - Irma Thomas  Sat back down at the bar. Tapped my fingers on the bar. All that bullshit. Had a few rounds. Looked at hipster girls.   Stumbled out of the joint around 12:30. Walked down 1st Ave. to 14th Street. Found out the L Train wasn't running, which really bummed me out. I was tempted to blow $12 on a cab ride back to Brooklyn, but I'd already gone through a fair amount of bread today, so I got on the bus. Wasn't sure where it was going. Ended up in the Lower East Side. Ave. C and Houston. Still tempted to grab a cab.   Walked up Houston to Clinton Street. Felt compelled to walk down Clinton St. for some reason. It reminded me of the film "Stranger Than Paradise" and Leonard Cohen's song "Famous Blue Raincoat." Both mention Clinton St. Walk south on Clinton, across Rivington. I pass the Lotus Lounge where I first heard Bjork's "So Broken." I thought about the girl I was with when I heard that song. It saddened me for a moment. But I kept walking south.   I took a left on Delancy, walked a few blocks to the F Train. It must've been around 1 am by now. There I sit on a bench in the Delancy station. There's a girl with a red shirt a few seats down. She has wonderful feet with red nail polish. I start to write what I'm writing now.   The train comes. I get on the train and sit across the girl with wonderful red painted toenails. I'm still writing in my little notebook. I play Leonard Cohen's "Famous Blue Raincoat" and I think about Clinton Street and I wish it was December.

      Another gal on G Train  Late Friday night on the G Train. I sit down across from this woman. Maybe in her 40s. Black dress. Curves in all the right places. A bit too much make-up. Wild blonde frizzy hair. She looks like this chick from Chicago I met when I was 18. I don't know why the hell I can remember this, but the Chicago chick really like Van Halen's "Jamie's Cryin'" at the time. But then again I've got one of those crazy musical memories where a song can immediately take me back 20 years. The memory's as fresh as yesterday...  But back to this chick sitting across from me. I look at her. She smiles a drunken, sexual smile. I smile back. A whole "Last Tango in Paris" scenario starts playing in my head. Yeah, whatever. But it's gone the second time I look at her. She's practically passed out. And speaking of passed out chicks, that reminds of another girl I knew in high school, but I'm not gonna go there now... I wouldn't you, dear reader, to get the wrong impression...

      From "Full Metal Jacket":  COLONEL You write "Born to Kill" on your helmet and you wear a peace button. What's that supposed to be, some kind of sick joke?!  JOKER No, sir.  COLONEL You'd better get your head and your ass wiredtogether,  or I will take a giant shit on you!  JOKER Yes, sir.  COLONEL Now answer my question or you'll be standing tall before the man.  JOKER I think I was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir.  COLONEL The what?  JOKER The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

      I felt an urge to explain the title of the blog. "Lazy, Flawed and Hopeless" is the name of a wonderful song by  urlLink Brazzaville . The tune is off an equally great album "Somnambulista."   "Tom Waits with all the gravel removed or Prefab Sprout in a deep depression"-Time Out New York  So when I was thinking about a title for the blog, this song came to me immediately. And while I know I can be quite lazy at times, and I know I'm flawed in many ways, I wouldn't exactly say I'm hopeless. I was hopeless about a year ago. Maybe the year before that too, but I'd like to think I'm beyond that now, though at times I might say I'm hopeless. Or at least I feel hopeless. Everybody does from time to time.   This blog used to be called "Notes of a Dirty Young Man," an obvious hommage to Bukowski's "Notes of a Dirty Old Man." Then I realized there were a few more blogs out there with the same name. And I hate that kind of shit. It's like walking down the street and seeing a guy with the same exact shirt you're wearing. I don't wanna be like everyone else, dammit... All right enough bitching and bullshit...  So I'm still searching for a more approrpriate title. In the meantime, I'd like to thank the Brazzaville dudes for the title inspiration.

         I don't know why the hell I didn't write about this before but I saw a screening of the new Bukowski documentary  urlLink Bukowski: Born Into This , which is going to start hitting theaters this weekend. It opens in NY June 4 at Cinema Village.   I knew Sean Penn, Bono and others were in it, but for some bizarre reason I didn't know my boy Tom Waits was in it. Yeah, I knew Tom was a fan of Buk, and I heard somewhere that Tom's song "Franks Wild Years" was inspired by Bukowski's poem "The Shoelace." Then I just caught wind of this wonderful  urlLink site  where you can see some great pics of Tom and read about how he had all these Bukowski books sprawled across the front seat of the Hearse he was driving at the time.   A review of the film is  urlLink  here .

      Ended up at Doc Holliday's for the first time in about a year or so. My cousin was in town. He wanted to go to some bar with a hottie behind the bar. Next thing ya know we're slinging $2 Pabst while George Jones plays on the juke. It was slow so the bartender asks if anyone wants to shoot pool. Out of about six guys at the bar, no one goes for the bait, so my cousin jumps on the opportunity. So the bartender is bending over the table, lower back showing and it's a wonderful. Would find out later she's from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. My cuz beats her, which I consider a bad move. I tell him he should've let her win. She would beat him the next game.   Anyway, after a PBRs, this guy shows up. Big guy, long goatee, bandanna around his head, tattoos all over arms and on the side of his face. Looks like a Hells Angel. A bit scary at first. He orders a coke. Asks for a lime. He starts talking to his buddy. Five minutes later this guy sounds like a very cool guy.   So then somebody left a plastic crab and three hula girl dolls at one of the tables. Far out...

      Thinking about all the wonderful things I've learned from reading bathroom grafitti. One that I always seem to remember when I see a beautiful girl is thus:  "No matter how hot the girl is, some guy somewhere is sick of her shit."

      Jesus, I cannot escape the Bukowski thing. I try and try. Wait, I don't try. There are just time where the bastard is like an older brother or a drinking buddy or something. As the MC5's Wayne Kramer once said about Bukowski: "What I think he did, what great art can do, what great music can do – it can reach out and touch you at a time when you need someone to kind of put their hand on shoulder and say, 'You’re not alone'."   So now the title of the blog is "The Insane Always Loved Me," a great fucking poem from "Love is a Dog From Hell."   And I hope I'm not coming across as some Bukowski wannabe and all that bullshit. I know I'm influenced by the guy a great deal. I can't escape that. Tom Waits as well. These guys are my heros. No doubt about that. And if the shit gets tedious, trite and all that, I hope somebody calls me on it.   So from no on, I'm just going to let the flow as it will. Whatever will be will be. And before I drown in cliches and horseshit, I'm gonna take a deep breath and think about some of the insane people I've known. And I'm going to write about them. And I'm going to write about me too. I know I'm mildly insane myself, sometimes more than mildly. But hey, I can embrace it, accept it and nurture it. You can't just stuff the madness into the cranial garbage disposal.   One has to bathe in madness and insanity. That's where the truth is...

      So I ended up at the Bowery Poetry Club last night for this "Bukowksi: Born Into This" NY premiere party. They showed some clips from the film, which opens tomorrow in NY at Cinema Village. Then people took turns reading their favorite Bukowski poems. It started with people reading on the stage, but then someone got out the wireless and it got passed around the bar.   I had "Tales of Ordinary Madness on Me" and I read my favorite passage from the book. It's the bit about how he's... aw shit, I cannot do it justice by paraphrasing it... I'll just give you the entire paragraph I read:  "And speaking of shit, constipation has always been a greater fear to me than cancer. If I miss one day without shitting, I can't go anywhere, do anything - I get so desperate when that happens that oftentimes I try to suck my own cock to unclog my system, to get things going again. And if you've ever tried to suck your own cock then you only know the terrible strain on the backbone, neckbone, every muscle, everything. You stroke the thing up as long as it will get then you really double up like some creature on a torture rack, legs way over your head and locked around the bedrungs, your asshole twitching like a dying sparrow in the frost, everything bent together around your great beer belly, all your muscle sheathes ripped to shit, and what hurts is that you don't miss by a foot or two - you miss by an eighth of an inch - the end of your tongue and the tip of your cock that close, but it might as well be an eternity or forty miles. God, or whoever the hell, knew just what He was doing when He put us together....  "But back to the insane."

      Somehow I started talking about this last night... About 10 years ago I met this girl and she wanted me to kill her. Basically she flat-out said, "Will you kill me?" right after we had sex. I'd met her four hours before. That's still a record for me. Well, almost a record for me. There were a few times down in Louisiana where many drinks in a few hour span clouded any deliniation of time. And I would somehow end up in the beds of large-breasted women. But that's another story.   So back to this chick who wanted me to kill her. I'm realizing that I could fully develop this whole thing into a short story, but I'm feeling a bit lazy, flawed and hopeless now. So I'll just give you the good parts. I'm not going to give you some Henry Miller babble philosophising about the world in the crack of a woman's and all that. I don't think either one of us would appreciate that.   Yeah, this chick says she wants me to kill her right after we fuck. She says something about how I'd just fucked death and that she doesn't feel anything any more. She wants to float down a river and die. Meanwhile I'm all sweating and panting and bullshit. This is all too much to take right after some heavy pumping, all right. I sit up cross-legged. Still sweating, still panting like the hairy, sweaty, panty bastard I can be. She rolls over on her side. I imagine her pulling a knife out from under her pillow and carving a big chunk out my lower back. Yet she does nothing of the sort.   I sit there for a while. Then it seems as though she's gone to sleep. I try getting out of this loft her bed was on. But it starts squeaking, which wakes her up. I climb down the ladder. I start putting my underwear on. She asks me to throw her robe up to her. I do so. She puts it on and comes down the ladder.   I've got my shirt on by the time she gets down. She sits on the couch. She wants me to sit down and talk. I'm just eager to get the fuck out of her place. I look at the Skinny Poster on her wall. It wasn't the same as this:     It looked like he'd smeared shit all over himself. I would find out later it was peanut butter. Come on, man, G.G. Allin already did the shit-smearing thing, man. ...  Anyhow, so I'm sitting on the couch with her. She seems like a completely different person. She's apologizing and whatnot, saying I was too "warm" of a person to do what she'd just done. Then she starts talking about how death just passes from one person to another. Then I remember she'd told me she was a social worker for kids who'd been sexuall abused by their siblings. And I look at the statue of Shiva. And I'm thinking if I don't get out of this place within two minutes my head is going to explode, I'm going to black out or this chick is going to slice me up and offer me to satanic gods.   Strangely enough she goes outside with me. I get my bike out of her car, which I was fully prepared to leave if I had to. I probably hadn't stopped sweating. I get on my bike and pedal as fast I can back to my house, an old Victorian rooming house I'd heard was once a crack house. Eyes wide open. Heart thundering. Sweating. Holy fucking Jesus, that whole thing didn't just happen. did it?

      I was at the Holiday Sunday. I think it was Sunday night. Sunday night is always a good night to go in there. Usually chilled out. Not too many kids. And when I say "kids" I'm talking about the college punks that fill up the joint on weekends and after 10 pm.   That silly fucking TV show that's a mockery of "American Idol" was on the WB network. It reminded me why I never watch TV. I had a TV. Never use it unless I'm watching Godard, Cassavetes or Max Hardcore videos. But if a TV is on in bar I can't help but watch it, especially if there aren't any broads in the place.  But then these gals come in. They're each big in all the right places. And they're fun to look at. Jesus, I can't believe I just wrote that sorry ass fucking sentence. But I'm gonna leave it for now.   Then these five guys come in. It's obvious they're in a band. First guess was a punk band. I find out I'm right a few minutes later. Turns out they came to the Holiday because the Bouncing Souls wrote a song called the "Holiday Cocktail Lounge." I tell them Madonna used to hang out in the place. (This is a true story). Then I tell them that her song "Holiday" was an hommage to the bar, but I'm not sure if it's entirely true.   Anyway, then it turns out that band is from the same part of Florida the girls are from. Bizarre things, man.

      All right, it's time to get down to some real shit. I've been pussyfooting too long. Pussyfooting ain't no fucking good unless you're a porn star or some bullshit. Anyway, a few needed rounds at the Holiday have prompted this. I cannot stop here to eat pretzels. That's going interrupt the flow. Or what's ever left.   This may now seem entirely coherent, but that doesn't matter. I'm going to try to get down something somewhat coherent and all that. So somewhere...

      I know there was a reason I posted that "Full Metal Jacket" scene. That whole "duality of man" concept has been fascinating me lately. I'd like to go into further detail about it now, but I don't know if I'm fully equipped. Fully armed, so to speak. I'm not even sure if any of that makes sense at all, but what the hell... Maybe it's just that the thoughts haven't fully congealed... The synapses haven't quite meshed. Times like this I scare myself. I'm not sure if I should listen to "Pet Sounds" or the "Clockwork Orange" soundtrack. But then again, maybe all this shit is just for effect.

      There hasn't been much insanity lately, that's why I've been focusing on the music lately. But I have a feeling something really strange and beautiful will happen tonight, hell, at least I hope so. I need insanity to keep me sane, or something like that. I'm not sure if that makes much sense. I'll have to think about that for a while. No midget orgies tonight unfortunately.

        I've been listening to Michael Blake's latest record "Blake Tartare" and I'm digging it, man. I first caught Blake a few years ago at the Knitting Factory. He was jamming with this bass player, whose name escapes right now, Steven Bernstein (of Sex Mob fame) and a few other cats. I was instantly drawn to Blake's sax playing. After the show we were trying to figure out who was playing sax on the CD that the bartender was playing. I thought it sounded a bit like Dexter Gordon. Blake tought it might've been Booker Ervin, who played on quite a few Mingus records. I'm not sure if we ever found out who it really was, but I'm guessing it was probably Booker. Anyhow, Blake told me to check some Clifford Jordan, especially his "These Are My Roots," which is an album of jazzed-up Leadbelly tunes. The first track on the record, "Dick's Holler," always knocks me out.   So I've seen Blake quite a few years in the past few years. When I saw him at Tonic about two years ago he introduced a new song called "Lemmy Caution," which was inspired by Godard's film "Alphaville." I just remember really digging the song. The title is easy to remember since I'm a big fan of Godard's films. So I was quite happy to see that the song is included on "Blake Tartare." I'm also digging his version of Mingus' "Meditation (For a Pair of Wirecutters)," which Big Lazy lovingly covers on their "New Everything" disc.   A trio of Danish dudes also do some great stuff on the disc. Soren Kjaergaard (piano, Fender Rhodes), drummer Kresten Osgood and bassist Jonas Westergaard play some heavy stuff throughout "Blake Tartare."   "Blake Tartare" is a damn fine album.   For more info, check out Michael's  urlLink web site .

      Man, it's breakin' my heart that all these amazing musicians have passed away recently. Yesterday Ray Charles. Steve Lacy last week. Last month Elvin Jones and Barney Kessel.     I saw Elvin Jones once. I feel like it's kind of pathetic to see one of the world's greatest jazz drummers just once. But then again I've seen a lot of jazz legends just once. I'm just glad to see these guys live. So I saw Elvin in Boston a few years ago. The guy thundered on the drums. Sheer power and force. And he was back there smiling the whole time. And if you haven't heard Elvin play, I'd recommend most of the Impulse recordings he did with Coltrane, especially "Crescent." And of course there's the momumental "A Love Supreme," which is hailed as one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. And now for soem reason I'm struggling with more words to say about the guy. I could go on and on and praise the guy for days. Let me just say he was an incredible drummer.     And Barney Kessel, man, he was a fine jazz guitarist. Maybe a bit underrated, but a great guitarist. He did quite a lot of studio work, namely The Beach Boys epic "Pet Sounds" record. Barney played the opening guitar line to "Wouldn't it Be Nice." He also played with Billie Holliday, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Lester Young and sat in a few Elvis Presley studio sessions.  I had a 1967 Gibson Barney Kessel model guitar for a while. I held on to it for a years and then sold it, partly because I didn't feel worthy playing it. It just didn't feel right, ya know...    The first record of Steve Lacy's I heard was "Reflections," his first album of Thelonious Monk songs. Elvin Jones also plays on the record. I was first drawn to the album because of his version of the song "Reflections," one of my favorite Monk songs. I think I was trying to round up all the various versions I could find at the time. But that Lacy "Reflections" album is a damn fine record. A few years ago I was at the Alto Jazz Cafe in Amsterdam and this tenor player Barend Middelhoff was playing "Reflections." He did a beautiful rendition of the tune. I talked to him after the show and he said Steve Lacy taught him that song. I thought that was a wonderful thing.

      Union Square Pervert... I get off the Q at Union Square. I see this group of girls. One of them has this short bouncy white skirt. All right, it's the perfect skirt for looking up on subway stairs. A wise man once told me the secret of seeing up a girl's skirt while walking up subway stairs is keeping a distance. If you're too close you can't really see anything. You got to be at the right angle. Someone said about 8 stairs is a good distance.  So I'm trying to keep my distance but I'm not seeing anything. It doesn't really matter that much to me. If I see some panty it brightens up my day. If not, hell, no big deal. It's up on flight of stairs. Then through the gates. I'm still keeping my distance. Then it's up the second flight of stairs that lead outside. Sometimes you have better luck with this set of stairs because the breeze kicks up at the top of the stairs.   OK, so now to aforementioned pervert. I'm about to climb the stairs when this guy comes running past me. He climbs up the stairs fast. He gets about three stairs from the girl in the white skirt. Then, get this, he crouches down, as she gets to the top of the stairs. This guy was determined to get a look. I was impressed by how bold the guy was. There were quite a few people on the stairs behind him and the guy's crouching down, bending over sideways just trying to get a glimpse at the chick's panties.   She's on the pavement, walking by the railing, the guy goes back down about four stairs. He's looking up eagerly. Hell, that skinny, shaved-head, bright-white sneaker-wearing perv just needed to see some panty. He didn't give a fuck if people saw him trying to look up her skirt. Holy Jesus...

      The junkie who sells stolen steaks. At least I'm pretty sure he's a junkie. Was pretty sure when his pants fell down just before he entered the door. He put down his shopping bags as he slowly pulled his pants up. He comes in the bar. Starts hitting up Steve the bartender. Steve has seen the stolen steak guy dealer before, and he doesn't want any stolen steaks. He just wants the fucker to leave. I want the guy to leave too. The guy wants $80 for $160 worth of steak. But he won't take "no" for an answer.   There are four guys at the bar, including me, and one lovely girl. I'm afraid the steak dealer is gonna scare the chick away. Hell, it's just nice to look at something other than the TV and a bunch of guys while you're drinking. You dig? And this girl has lovely breasts. And I can't help but looking at them while she writes in her little notebook.   And the steak dealer junkie motherfucker is getting in the way of my high. Here I am just wanting to get lost in the beauty of a single girl at the bar while drinking a beer. But this fucker is getting me down. My neck's tightening up. I think putting my hands behind the guy's head and forcing it into the bar repeatedly. I think about doing this because this guy is a lowlife scum. Jesus, peddling fucking stolen steaks to support your habit.   I try to think good thoughts. I try to focus on the girl. I want to be good. I try to be good, but one of these days I feel like I'm going bezerk and pull Billy Jack on someone. It's back to whole duality of man concept that I touched on last week with that bit from "Full Metal Jacket." The Jekyll and Hyde thing. I think we all have a bit of that in us. The good and evil. Dark and light. Ying and Yang and all that... I could go into this further, but I think the results might be futile at this present time.   Anyway, so the junkie asks Steve for some more ice for his ice tea. Why can't this fucker just leave, man? Just grab your Macy's bags full of steaks and get the fuck out of the bar, man. But he starts to roll a cigarette. He rolls it slow. He picks up his bags and heads for the door. But first he stops right near where the girl is sitting. He asks Steve for a book of matches. He puts a quarter on the bar. I'm inching my ass off the stool, ready to pounce on the fucker if he tries any bullshit with the girl. Fuck, just let the girl drink in peace. I'm sure she doesn't appreciate some junkie-ass stolen steak dealer rubbing up against her bare shoulder.   But finally the fucker leaves. He goes up the stairs outside. He stands at the top of the stairs. Puts his bags down. Takes a good few minutes to light his cigarette. I'm grateful the guy is gone.

      More insanity...  Sunday night in the Holiday. It had been a week since I'd been there last.   So I sit down near the jukebox. 10 minutes later these two guys come in. One guy is really skinny, saggy jeans. Probably in his early 60s. He looks defeated. He hasn't shaved in a few days. When he speaks I think he's drunk. But I would find out later it's the way he talks. It reminded me of the first time I heard Joe Walsh speak. I thought he was quite wasted.   Anyway, his buddy next to him is wearing a baseball cap. Maybe Bergdorf's Chicago on the hat. Short hair, big ears. Nose looks like it's been broken at least once. About half down, his nose angled to the right. I think he said he was 63. His skinny friend was buying the drinks.   So then I find out the skinny guy, we'll call him George, used to hang out with this chick Ginger. And I'd never met Ginger. I've only heard stories. I think she died within the last month. That's why George was at the Holiday. He was paying his respects for the gal. It sounded like it had been a while since he'd seen her. So he and buddy came to drink and talk about Ginger, among other things.   I would find out later Ginger was once a Rockette. Gorgeous. Wore a mink. Had guys all over her. I think she married a few times, but always had guys on the side. As it turned out, most of the guys she married died. Someone called her a black widown. Someone else said she was a serial killer.   But somehow George survived. And if I heard correctly, I thought his buddy said Ginger tried to poison him. Said he was sick for two weeks.   So I was drinking slow. Had some heartburn from a spicy burrito earlier. The whisky wasn't helping any. I put a few songs on the jukebox. Roy Orbison "Only the Lonely." The guy with the hat, big ears, and crooked nose says that's one of his favorite song. He says he likes Screamin' Jay Hawkins too. Then he says he some Madonna tapes that he thinks are worth at least $100. I ask him if he ever saw Madonna at the Holiday before she was famous. He says he doesn't remember.   Gradually things start to get surreal. The Tony Awards are on TV. Hugh Jackman's dancing around like a ferry. George says that Lynne the bartender "is a nobody." She starts going off on him. Then he sits down in the back and tries to talk to Stephan. Meanwhile the guy with the hat and the ears starts talking to me about music.   Stephan goes outside. George follows him outside. Stephan comes back in. George follows him. Lynne's still pissed that she was called "a nobody." I've got people trying to talk to me from both sides. Then there's fucking Hugh Jackman prancing around in his leopard skin shirt and his gold pants.   Holy fucking Jesus, I need to get out of here, I thought. I started to feel lightheaded. And it wasn't from the booze. I felt like these freaks were taking my oxygen. My eyes half open.   Then I think of a story about a Ginger, with a two-karat diamond on, punching some guy in the face. The ring gets stuck in his collar. She thinks someone stole her ring. She blamed Stephan, but he was at the other end of the bar. And I begin to wonder if she really did kill these guys. And why is George still alive?

      Well, the weird shit didn't go down Saturday night as I hoped. I ended up drinking for an hour at the Nancy Whisky Pub in Tribeca while I waited for a friend to show up. Man, that place seems a bit out of place among all the hip bars and clubs and whatnot. It's the kind of place that should be either the East Village, near Penn Station or in Hell's Kitchen. It was a great thing that there only a few people in the place at 10:30 on a Saturday night. The last thing I need when I'm drinking by myself and waiting on a friend are a bunch of drunk retards.   So I drank, listened to the conversation between a man and a woman, and I looked at the people walking on the sidewalk. Trying to remember what the gal was saying. Such a mishash of things. She sounded rather fascinating, but I don't remeber the guy getting in more than 10 words. I've been in that situation many times before. Sometimes it was because I felt like I didn't have anything to say, other times I didn't have any other choice.   But the bits I do remember out the gal was that she had a mohawk when she was a teenager. Maybe punk rock. But she did her homework and then got stoned. Got straight A's. Recently she's been teaching some sort of martial art. She talked about books. "The Corrections" might've been in there. Then I sort of tuned out after that.   Someone put two Cranberries songs on back to back. I tried not to listen. Some other guy was talking. Had a Wolfman Jack thing going on his vocal delivery. Sounded like he was trying to caugh up phlegm with every syllable. No, it wasn't that. It was more like he'd just taken a big bong hit and he was trying to hold in the smoke while talking. But it was more grit. Sandpaper in the vocal chords.   I got tired of waiting for the friend so I walked down two blocks to where the party was. Jesus, this guy had a big loft. Biggest apartment I've been in while living in New York. I immediately started hitting the booze. Talked to a few people I knew there. A few minutes after I got there the friend I'd been waiting for called. She was at the bar I'd just been at. We stayed for an hour so. I talked to a drummer friend who I hadn't seen in few months. We talked music as we usually do. His dad played percussion with some heavy hitters like Herbie Hancock, Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo, including his great song "Spanish Grease."  So then my friend and I cut out, caught a cab and headed to the East Village for another party. Totally different scene. It was dark, man, candles and whatnot. Techo music. I couldn't tell you what was playing, since techo is a genre I haven't had the urge to explore. Never really did anything for me. Sure, I can get down with some electronic, ambient and whatnot, but I ain't too hip on techno, industrial and the like. Never could dance to the shit either. But then again, I much of a dancer. But I have been known to get down on the funk, especially if it's that dirty funk, man. Nasty funk. That's some shit I can really bug out to...  Around 2 am, I was starting to wear down a bit. I'd been drinking for four hours straight. And I'm getting too old to be really hanging tough at parties and shit. I hadn't been pacing myself too well. I started off drinking too fast in the beginning and didn't really slow down.   Anyhow, I met a few new people. A metal guitar player. We talked about the new Metallica documentary that's coming out soon. I said I'd just seen the preview that afternoon when I saw "Napoleon Dynamite." Oh yeah, so speaking of that flick, I was amazed at the amount of hipsters at the movie. I was tempted to get up in front of the screen and ask just how many people came in from Williamsburg. But fortunately there were no trucker hats. Actually I haven't seen too many trucker hats in the last few months, which I think is a wonderful thing. Fucking trucker hats are the work of the devil. I'm hoping they're on their way out, along with flared jeans, checkered Vans and big belt buckles...

      I was at the Holiday last night and I found out that Stromboli Pizza, which is a few doors down, was shut down for the past few days by the Health Department. I didn't find out exactly what they got the shut down for, but they're open again. And I don't think I'm going in there for a while, even though they do make a good slice, which tastes especially good after a few rounds at the Holiday.   So then we got to talking about Chinese food and how there's an old myth that use pigeon and rat in place of chicken and beef. I remembered one particular time I was eating some General Tsao's "Chicken" and I looked at the piece of "chicken" for a moment before I forked it into my mouth. And why I was chewing I thought about how the "chicken" was sort of an off grey. Yeah, I know it didn't seem quite right. But I swallowed it anyway. I was paranoid for the next few hours, thinking I was going to get food poisoning. And hey, a little tip, if you're paranoid about what you stick in your mouth stay away from Chinese restaurants and, well...   Speaking of Chinese restaurants, I was telling the folks at the bar last night about this article I read in the New Yorker, or at least I'm fairly sure it was the New Yorker. Yeah, I had a subscription to that rag for about a year. Didn't read nearly as much as I should have. But I felt cool holding it on the subway, looking at the cartoons and bullshit....  So in this article, if I remember correctly, the author started off writing about how the hind quarters of a German Sheppard were found in a the freezer of a restaurant in Chinatown. He'd heard about dogs being something of a delicacy in China and whatnot. So throughout the article he hunts around for restaurants that might serve dog, even though it's against the law in the U.S. He thougtht there might be some underground joint or somethng. Again, I read this article at least a year ago and what I remember could be way off. But what I do remember is that he finally found a place, maybe in Queens, that would cook a dog for him. The only catch was that he'd have to bring the guy a dog. So he goes to the pet store. He starts looking at the dogs. He thinks about them getting hacked up and whatnot, turned into food, and then he chickens out. Or at least I think he chickens out...   I'm gonna see if I can track down the story...

      Back to the duality of man thing... Some shit went down Thursday. Got me extremely pissed off. Thought about smashing heads against the wall and all that. And then I started thinking about all the other shit that's happened to me over the years. All the other bullshit. All the people who have taken advantage of me. All the people I've let take advantage of me. Hell, a guy tries to be nice. A guy sacrifices his own happiness for someone else. A guy can bit his tongue for only so long. A guy can only go so long with his balls squeezed between his legs like a bitch. It really fucking gets a guy down.   And so Thursday night I thought about that scene in "American History X" where the guy puts the other guy's face on the curb and stomps on it. Or a scene in the play "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" where Danny's talking about he stomped a guy's chest and he heard something break.   Yeah, sure it's a bit fucked to think these things. It really is. But I'm just thinking about them. I'm not out there doing it. I've been writing it about it the whole weekend to try and flush some of this fucking anger and resentment out of my system. And it's working a bit. And getting drunk helps for a few hours. But in the morning it's there again.   But let me say I'm a peaceful guy. I really am. I'm a lover not a fighter. Then the toss in the fact that I got mugged a few blocks from house. Got punched in the jaw, shoved on the ground and my wallet stolen a few weeks ago. Jesus, all this shit instills evil in a guy.  Jesus, I think I just need a weekend alone in the woods of Vermont. Just listen to Bach, read and think happy thoughts.

      Yeah, I know I can be a sick fucker sometimes, but I gotta come clean on what I saw today.   So before work I stopped in the coffee shop near my crib. It was quite crowded for your average Thursday morning. While I'm waiting for the gal to make my tea, I see this gal with an iBook. Blonde, hip, glasses, white skirt. Fucking gorgeous. Jesus, almost everything I could want in a woman, at least as far as looks go.   I get me tea and look around for a seat. There's one small table left. I sit down and realize I've got a great view of the girl's legs and skirt. There's a guy who's blocking the view of the rest of her. So I sit there, like the pervert bastard that I am, and I'm overjoyed I can just stare at this girl's legs without her seeing me.   So I stared at her legs for a half an hour, then left. I got on the subway and started writing the following in my notebook:  I just spent the last half an hour looking at this girl's legs. Because I could. Because I had the perfect view and knew she couldn't see me staring at her legs, calves, thighs, feet, toes... Then those flashes of baby blue panties. Fucking maddening. I was in love. Heart fluttering. Jesus, I haven't had a girl do that to me in a long time.   But the fact that I could just stare at her legs without her seeing me was fucking exhilating. And like Bukowski has said, he could stare at a pair of woman's legs for hours. Hell, if I didn't have to go to work I would've stayed there as long as she sat there.   It was truly a magic thing, man, the legs crossing, the rubbing of the thighs, the scratching of the calves...   I felt guilty sitting there, staring. I couldn't help. This gal just had amazing legs, calves, ankles, feet, toes... Fucking beautiful...

      And speaking of music, another thing I've been wanting to mention is writing about music. There was a time, about 10 years ago, when I actually considered myself something of a music journalist. For some reason I'm struggling with writing anything profound about music these days. Lately, all I can really say is if something is good or bad. I just don't have the energy to listen to something a few times and really analyze it. I just don't see the point. When I try to critique something it just takes away from the overall listening experience. And sure, I'd like to bust out some Lester Bangs kind of riff. But it just ain't me. Hell, I just want to listen, man. Listen and not think about what to write about it. Or think about who else it sounds like. And try to plug in some hole so someone else can get some kind of handle on it...  I think it was Frank Zappa who once said, "Writing about music is like dancing about architecture."  And one more thing, if you haven't heard  urlLink Beatallica , you gotta check these cats out...

      So let me lay off the pervert thing, and talk about music for a bit here. I picked up Dorothy Ashby's "Afro Harping" CD today. I'm listening to her version of Bacharach's "The Look of Love" and has a Mongo Santamaria groove happening, which reminds me of Mongo's "Afro Blue." As far as I know Dorothy was one of the few, or maybe the only, harpists on the jazz scene. I've never played harp before, but I can't imagine it being that easy to play a bop harp. Lets just say the gal grooved on the harp. And while she got down on the some hard bop on in "In a Minor Groove," she got a bit more funky on "Afro Harping." Both are some great recordings. Highly recommended...

      All right, I think I just need to come clean here... First thing is to quit apologizing for being somewhat of a perv. Yeah, so I admit it. No denying it. So there, that's done. Now I can move on to more perverse meanderings.   I had the day off today, so I had plenty of time to look at women. Bottom line, I just haven't had the chance to really look at them in the last few. Sure, I notice them. But I haven't really been taking them in. Drinkign their feature. Well, yeah, I did look at the gal's legs and feet and whanot for a good half an hour a few days ago, but that's an exception.   The main thing I took note of today were all the bra-less women. While this can sometimes be a wonderful thing, sometimes it doesn't work. But a pair of unholstered small-to-medium-sized breasts bouncing beneath a white spaghetti strap halter is, in fact, a beautiful thing. But then again, it is a bit maddening to look at. And yeah, I could on and on about women's breasts right now, but I think I'm leave it at that and move on to the subway ride home...  I was standing next to this blonde on the L Train. So what if she was wearing red Reebok sneakers and purple let warmers, I was intrigued. So what if she was about two inches taller than me, and I'm almost six feet tall. This gal was oozing with sexiness. I didn't want to be blantant about checking her out. My main fixation was the red Reeboks and the purple leg warmers. Oh yeah, there was the plaid mini-skirt, which catered to my English schoolgirl fetish. Jesus, I can't believe I just said that bullshit about the schoolgirl thing. But hell, I sure as fuck know that I'm not the only one.  Then, in peripheral vision I saw that she was holding something with both hands. Then I glanced over and I want to say it was white and phallic. But I couldn't bring myself to look over again. I wanted to think she was holding a vibrator. And as I said before, I'm not going to apologize any more for being something of a perv. And yeah, I really fucking doubt she would be actually holding goddamned vibritor on a Brooklyn-bound L train on a Monday night. But a guy can always fantasize, right? Jesus....

      A few more quotes from "A Confederacy of Dunces":  "I am an anachronism. People realize this and resent it."  "Optimism nauseates me. It is perverse. Since man's fall, his proper position in the universe has been one of misery."

      "In the beginning there was nothing, but it was kind of fun watching nothing grow."  These words open the CD "Total Lee! The Songs of Lee Hazelwood." Just started listening to it. I'm digging it so far. I think I started to really take notice of Lee after hearing him do "Some Velvet Morning" with Nancy Sinatra on the thoroughly wonderful "Movern Callar" soundtrack. Now I'm listening to the Webb Brothers play the tune. It's quite faithful to Lee's version.   So let me go back to the "Movern Callar" soundtrack. But I still haven't seen the film. I've held off on seeing for a few months now. Maybe I'm thinking seeing the film my taint my perception of the music. And according to the All Muisc Guid, the soundtrack is intrinsically linked to the film. "More specifically, it's a re-creation of the mix tape left to the heroine -- Morvern Callar -- by her boyfriend, just prior to his suicide," states AMG's Andy Kellman.  "The tape is Morvern's constant companion; she seemingly comes to grips with her loss by losing grip of everything, save for the tape -- marked 'Music for You' -- that is left to her."  After reading this, the soundtrack took on a whole new meaning for me. It took on one of those hauntingly beautiful vibes for me. I started to piece the guy together. Because the music you listen to you and the groceries you buy at the supermarket say a lot about a person... More on the grocery bit later... But it's kind of like reading a book and then seeing the film. Jesus, I my thoughts are all over the place now...  On one hand, I want to write about this chick I stood in line behind at the supermarket a few years ago, who for some bizarre reason I can still remember quite vividly. And I remember nearly everything she had in her shopping cart. It was something like this: 12-pack of Bud, big bottle of cheap vodka, big bottle of Jack, eight cans of Friskies cat food, a carton of Marlboro Reds, and two boxes of Massengill douche. See, on one hand seeing all that shit in her cart was turning me on. I mean, hell, to think of some gal going home, feeding her cats, getting shit-faced, smoking up a storm and douching... But something told me it could never be a lasting relationship, even if she did get it clean under the hood. And something else told me that she probably wouldn't appreciate the subtle magic of a Godard film. So I just went home and wrote a poem about her.       Going back to the reading the book and then seeing the film thing, I found out a while back that "A Confederacy of Dunces" is finally being made into a film. I think they started filming last winter in New Orleans. And ya know, I really don't know if Will Ferrell could do justice to the role of Ignatius. I read somewhere that John Belushi slated to play Ignatius. But then Belushi did that speedball and died. I'd also heard that John Goodman was up for the part a while back. Hell, Goodman's from New Orleans and all.   So, on one hand, I'd really like to see what they do with the film, but then I'd also be hesitant about seeing it for it might scar my own version of the film I already have in my head.   And yeah, I could on for quite some time about what an amazing book "A Confederacy of Dunces" is, and how if you too have dug the book I'd also recommend the biography of John Kennedy Toole called "Ignatius Rising." The two writers did a pretty good job with piecing together Toole's life. There's an interesting bit in the book about Robert Gottlieb, the original editor of the book. From what I recall, Gottlieb was working with Toole on the book, and apparently Gottlieb told Toole he needed to basically re-write the book. Not too long after that, Toole disappeared for two weeks. He was finally found in Biloxi, Mississippi. He was in his car. A garden hose running from the tail pipe through a small crack in the window. Suicide by carbon dioxide poisoning. He was 32 years old.   I might be a bit off on those facts, since I'm just going from memory. But that's the way I remember it.   Incidentally, Gottlieb also edited Bill Clinton's new autobiography...

      Oh yeah, I had something of an epiphany yesterday. This hipster walked past me yesterday. I could smell his unwashed pits for a good minute after he passed me.   The this is what I came up with:   Hipsters are the new hippies. They're the hippies of the new millenium.  Just a thought. I haven't had time to really flesh this idea out. But I'm sure there are more than a few similarties between the hipster and hippie cultures. And beside the fact that they both have "hip" in their names...   Any thoughts, comments and whatnot, please shoot 'em my way....

      It was hot underground this morning. Muggy as fuck while I waited for the Q train. By the time the train pulls into the station I'm a sweaty bastard. The beads of sweat of percolating furiously on my forehead. There was a seat next to this girl that I will mention later. But I'm not a big fan sitting right next to people on the subway. I need my space. Especially when I'm sweating like a motherfucker.   So I'm leaning against the doors. You're not supposed to that, or at least that's what the stickers say on the doors, but I do it all the time. I haven't fallen out yet. And I'm still sweating even though A/C is pumping. Sometimes it takes me a while to cool down. Then I start thinking about all this stuff. Things that I should've done over the weekend for work. I started thinking about all this other shit. There's just something about riding subways that does this to me sometimes. It provokes thinking about all kinds of shit at once. The mind starts racing. I start concentrating on a section of the subway floor.   This morning I figured some Bach on the headphones might help. Harpsichord and Viola da Gamba. Keith Jarrett on the harpsichord. I turn it up almost as loud as it will go. I close my eyes, take a few breaths. But I'm still hot. I'm wiping the sweat from my head with both hands.   Then a guy gets up from his seat, but he’s still standing in front of the seat. And it’s bugging me. Why can't he stand near the door if he's going to get off the train. I’m really fucking tired. I’m sweating and I just want to sit down. I feel like I’m going to pass out, or have a nervous fucking breakdown.   So finally the guy gets off the train. I sit down. I look at the girl with the blonde hair across from me. She looks at me for a moment. She didn’t do that thing that most people do when they catch you looking at them. She just looked at me for a moment. My entire shaved head was covered with sweat. I close me eyes, still trying to concentrate on Bach. I’m still wiping the sweat off with both hands, then wiping off my wet palms on the legs of my jeans. Hell, chicks dig that kind of shit.   After I’ve calmed down a bit, I look at the gal again. I notice she’s wearing a Unity t-shirt, obviously inspired by Larry Young’s incredible “Unity” album. If you know the album, you’d recognize the shirt. Yeah, I think it's a damn fine album. Larry on organ, Joe Henderson (one of my favorite tenor players), Woody Shaw on trumpet and Elvin Jones on drums. Anyway, I was quite impressed this gal was wearing the shirt.   So I pull out Raymond Carver’s book of short stories and start trying to re-read “Cathedral.” But I couldn’t read because I was having a near-breakdown again. Well, I don’t know if it was that bad. I’ve been thinking about this concept for quite some time. But I still haven’t completely lost it. And I’d like to think that I’ve been closer to that before. I mean, closer to actually cracking. And that was when I wasn’t really doing much with my life. Too much time to think. To much time to think is a horrible thing, hell, unless you’re a philosopher or some kind of bullshit. At least I can go to work and stop thinking about myself for the entire. Keeps me from worrying about myself. And that’s a sad fucking thing to sit around and worry about shit, especially your own bullshit. It’s fucking horrible, man. It can fuck a guy up. It can make a man sick. Nausea. Makes a guy want to write his own version of "Nausea" or "Notes from the Underground" of something...  Too much thinking is what makes a man go mad. That’s what I think. Too much thinking is madness.   Oh yeah, I forgot to say what happened with the chick on the train. She looked at me a few times. I thought I saw a half smile. It was one of the those indecipherable looks. But I couldn’t figure it out. A bizarre thing. We both got off at Union Square. I took out my headphones as I walked up the stairs. I was determined to talk to the girl. The shirt was the key. I’d ask her about the shirt. But I couldn’t do it, man. I just followed her through the farmer’s market. She waited at the corner for the light. I went west on 17th. That was that.   Now, that I’m thinking about, I think the main reason I didn’t say anything to her was that she didn’t give me enough to go on. If there was just a bit more a smile, hell, if the corners of her mouth might've just curled up a bit more, that would've been enough...

      A bizzare thing how I can start a day completely fucking mad at the world and then accomplish a few things that have been eating my gut and then come home feeling like I've taken one of those beautiful shits. One of those shits where you can feel it in your gut, where just know the shit's gonna come pouring out fast, painless and clean. Not one of those strainers where you're it feels your nutsack is getting ripped open too...   So lets just say I think I'm going to sleep better tonight. It's been quite hard to sleep with all this shit floating around in my head. All these thoughts and fears and bullshit. Fear has really fucked me up for a long time. It really has. Hell, nearly my entire life. Fear stabs my in the gut on a daily basis. Hell, I'd think I would've learned by now. You'd think I would've learned a lesson or two from all the thousands of times I've been afraid to do something.   And what's funny is that I got the urge to watch "Donnie Darko" again. It's been a year or so since I saw it last. I'm even tempted to check out the director's cut of the flick, which opens in NY this weekend. But it's a strange thing that although the Swayze's character somewhat of a moron, he did have some interesting things to say about fear that I could relate with.   Anyhow, fear has really fucked me up with women for years. When I look back at all the women I've dated, a majority of them were gals that I knew liked me beforehand. There was hardly any pursuing. I was too scared. Mostly I've opted for the sure thing, or at least the almost sure thing. It's just easier that way. And the easy is hardly the best way. Hell, you never grow if you don't challenge yourself. Yeah, it's easy for me to say.

        I don't why it's taken me this long to realize what a genius Raymond Carver was/is. And I say "is" because my notion is that writers never really die. Or when I read books I always imagine the writer as still being alive. A bizarre concept, yes, I know. It's the same thing when I listen to music or watch a film. Although these artists might technically dead, they are stilll very much alive through their "art."   So back to Carver. I've read him off and on for at least 15 years now. "Cathedral" was the first thing I'd read of his. It might've been for a college English class. I thought it was a "nice" short story, but it took me years to realize what an extremely well-crafted piece of writing it is. I just got to thinking about this woman I had dinner with nearly 15 years ago. I'm guessing she might be 20 years older than me. I'd just started to get into writing and over dinner I asked her who her favorite writers were and she mentioned Carver. I know I'd read a few of his stories at that time. And I might've even said that Carver and Hemingway were my favorite writers.   I always appreciated a writer who didn't use all the flowery horseshit to say something simple. I mean, who needs all the extra fat. I think it might have been around this time that I read Bukowski's "Hollywood" in a college English class. I was living in San Pedro too. It must have been '88 or '89. And it would take me a few more years to realize what a genius he was as well. But this girl I knew from Denver was in L.A. for a few hours so I picked her up and we had dinner. She told me how she looked Bukowski up in the phone book. He was listed. She called him. He answered. "Is this Charles Bukowski?" she asked. He said it was and hung up. Many years later I was reminded of this when I read his poem about being listed in the phone book.   So let me get back to Carver. He's the reason I started writing this, not Bukowski. And while I could easily start comparing Bukowski and Carver, I'm not going to do that now. I think I'll just stick to Carver.   A few weeks ago, after a few rounds at the Holiday, I stopped by East Village books and picked up a used copy of Carver's book of short stories "Cathedral." I might already have a copy somewhere in my apartment. But I saw the book and I had the urge to read him. So this particular copy I picked used to belong to a gal named Nettie Kelly. She wrote her name on the first page, not too far from that picture of Carver.   When I got to the L train station, I opened the book and flipped through the pages to see which passages she'd underlined. The only story she'd really concentrated on, or at least as far as the underlining goes, was "A Small, Good Thing." I'd remembered reading the story in his collection of short stories "Short Cuts," which is basically all the short stories the film of the same name was based on. I'd remembered reading the story. And as I read it this time around, I was reminded of the film where a boy gets hit by a car on his fifth birthday.   So tonight I was sitting a bar in Park Slope. Tom Waits was singing "Invitation to the Blues" on the jukebox. It's raining. There's a girl by herself a few stools down. She's reading the Onion. I look at her a few times in the mirror behind the bar. I see her looking out the window. I glance over and notice she has these amazing liquid blue eyes.   I pull the Carver book from my bag. I flip through the pages and stumble upon the story "Where I'm Calling From." I start to read. And as I read I'm reminded of what an amazing writer Carver is. So I start reading about how J.P. fell into a well when he was 12 years old and the terror he suffered hollering and looking up at the mouth of the well. After J.P. graduates high school he had no idea what to do with his life. He ends up at friend's house. A woman comes by. She's dressed in black. Black top hat. She's the chimney sweep. The two boys watch her clean the chimney. After she finishes she lets J.P. kiss her. It was then that he knew that he wanted that gal and wanted to be a chimney sweep.   I don't think I'm really doing the story justice by trying to summarize it. But there was something quite beautiful in the way Carver tells J.P.'s story. And while reading this story I think I truly realized what a great writer Carver is. I think I'll leave it at that and hope you will read the story as well...

      Had a dream about a woman last night. First dream I've remembered in months. They say people have about five or so dreams a night. The thing is a lot of people rarely ever remember their dreams. But this one I had last night was hard to forget...  So one of the more interesting things about the dream was this gal, who happened to be completely naked, had a purse with half-full of freshly shaved pubic hair. I had this feeling that she borrowed my electric trimmer, and clipped off a huge bush into her purse. All that was left was one of those obscenely silly "landing strips." I'm not a big fan of those, or fully-shaved bushes. But in the dream the landing strip was working for me. This girl was way too skinny as well. So skinny her pelvic bones are sticking out and all that. But somehow it's working in the dream. She's turning me on and all that. And then I see her open purse on the bed with all these pubic hair clippings and it's kind of freaking me out.

         Saw Buckethead Friday night at the Bowery Ballroom. I've been listening for almost 10 years, but I've never had the chance to see the guy live. The guy is fucking insane guitar player. Just crazy, man. Yeah, it's easy to say the guy shreds. But it's beyond shredding, man. I've been playing guitar for 20 years and I'm pretty good, but some of the stuff Buckethead was doing was downright incomprehensible. I just got to the point where I figured I wouldn't try to understand it any more. Step aside any analytical reasoning and just try to listen, man.  It's one thing to listen to the guy on CD, it's another thing to actually see him play. And then it's whole other thing trying to put the two together. His fingers blurred across the fretboard in a frenzy, unleashing a torrent of notes. Yeah, I know that last sentence is cheesy as fuck, but it's the only thing I could think of offhand. And I don't want to get too heavy and prosaic about watching him play and shit...   But then you've got Brain on drums, manic and rapid fire. And House holding down the fort with the solid bass grooves. At one point, it might have been after a crazy Zeppelin medley, that they busted into Weather Report's "Teen Town" with House, fingers flying over the fretboard of his Musicman bass, pulling out some insane Jaco-like runs.

      Listening to Bill Evans tonight. It's been a while since I've listened this extraordinary jazz pianist. I had the urge to listen to him again after to talking with my cousin the other night. I was saying how my favorite Evans material was when he was playing with bassist Scott La Faro (who died in his mid-20s if I'm not mistaken) and drummer Paul Motian. I think all these recordings were made on the Riverside label. For some reason I was thinking they were on the Prestige label. Hell, it's easy to get the two mixed up because they've both been part of Fantasy/OJC for quite some time now.   I remember reading somewhere how Prestige was at one time called "the junkies label" because they'd pay cash at the recording sessions. And it usually wasn't too much cash, but enough to keep the musicians fixed for a while, from what I recall. And then Bill Evans hit the junk for a while as well. There's one album cover, I forget which one, but you can actually see tracks on the dude's arms.   For some reason, all this shit fascinates me. And if there was one time period I wish I could've been around in, it would've been the late-'50s, early '60s in New York, and just checking out the jazz. I wish I could've been in my 20s back then.   Anyhow, moving on with some more jazz stuff, I was doing some research on trumpeter Lee Morgan. I'd heard rumors that he was shot by his woman while he was playing a gig... Then I found this NY Times article that validates it:    New York Times, Feb. 20, 1972  JAZZ MUSICIAN SLAIN IN NIGHTCLUB  Lee Morgan, a well-known jazz trumpet player, was shot and killed early yesterday at Slugs, and East Village nightclub at 243 East Third Street where his quintet was playing.   The police said Mr. Morgan, who was 33 years old and lived on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, was shot by a woman whom they identified as Helen More, 47.   Mr. Morgan had completed an early-morning show with his group and was sitting at the bar when he became engaged in a quarrel with Miss More, the police said. She left, but returned a short while later.  The police said the argument was renewed, a shot was fired and Mr. Morgan fell to the floor with a bullet in his heart.   Miss More, whom the police said was Mr. Morgan’s common-law wife, was held without bail for action by the grand jury.

      Spent a good portion of the day plowing through Hunter S. Thompson's "Hell's Angels." Some wild shit. Just finished reading about some Angels hanging out Ken Kesey's crib. Everybody eating acid and shit. Hunter and Ginsburg getting pulled over as they left Kesey's place. But that's just a small piece of the book. Some crazy fucking tales at the Bass Lake run and whatnot. Anyhow, the Angels have intrigued me since watching "Gimme Shelter" many years ago. I've seen the flick at least 15 times since then.   I'd started reading a few months back. I stopped reading it about half way through for some bizarre reason. Since I was reading Hunter's biography I figured I'd go back and finish "Hells Angels." And ya know, I still haven't fucking read "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." I've tried to watch the flick and can never get through it. I remember digging "Rum Diary" a few years back on a solo trip to Europe. Enough about Hunter...   I think I got pink eye. It feels like I have a grain of sand under my upper eyelid since Friday. It hurts to blink and my eye keeps tearing up. From what I gather, these things usually clear up in a few days, or at least I hope so. It ain't no big thing. Things could be worse, like constipation, which really fucks me up. But I haven't had to deal with that thanks to some stuff my cousin turned me on to... It really rocks the bowels.. Good clean dumps...

      It's been a while since I mentioned the Holiday... Hell, a year or so that's all I would write about. Hell, I thought about writing a book about my experiences there. Anyway, somehow I started to this guy about the Cameron Diaz video that's been floating around the net. Yeah, I know it's really fucking pathetic to admit to seeing the thing. It's even more pathetic to talk about it. But he was saying how he liked Cameron and all, and I was surprised he didn't hear about the thing. For those of you who haven't seen it, you're not missing anything. It's bullshit, man. Horrible quality and all that... Jesus, it's even more pathetic to be even writing about it...  And so after a few rounds, I stepped out into the night, and while walking north on 1st Ave. I got the urge to write. So I stopped in a deli on 12th and picked one of the black composition books. I started scribbling and walking. Lets just say it had to do with an ex-girlfriend. I'm not going to get into details, because I plan to revisit what I wrote this weekend and really expound on it.  But ya know, it really felt good to scribble in that fucking notebook. Buzzed and writing ferociously. "Dirge" by Death in Vegas on the headphones. And then looking at girls feet on the subway platform in between word bursts. It was beautiful, man.
