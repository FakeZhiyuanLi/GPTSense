       urlLink Joke Results -- WWW.JOKES.COM   Heaven's New Policy    It was getting a little crowded in Heaven, so God decided to change the admittance policy. The new law was that, in order to get into Heaven, you had to have a really bad day when you died. The policy would go into effect at noon the next day. The next day at 12:01, the first person came to the gates of Heaven. The Angel at the gate, remembering the new policy, promptly said to the man, "Before I let you in, I need you to tell me how your day was going when you died."  "No problem," the man said. "I came home to my 25th floor apartment on my lunch hour and caught my wife half naked. She appeared to be having an affair, but her lover was nowhere in sight. I immediately began searching for him. My wife was yelling at me as I searched the entire apartment. Just as I was about to give up, I happened to glance out onto the balcony and noticed that there was a man hanging off the edge by his fingertips! The nerve of that guy! Well, I ran out onto the balcony and stomped on his fingers until he fell to the ground. But wouldn't you know it, he landed in some trees and bushes that broke his fall and he didn't die. This pissed me off even more. In a rage, I went back inside to get the first thing I could get my hands on to throw at him. Oddly enough, the first thing I thought of was the refrigerator. I unplugged it, pushed it out onto the balcony, and tipped it over the side. It plummeted 25 stories and crushed him! The excitement of the moment was so great that I had a heart attack and died almost instantly."   The Angel sat back and thought a moment. Technically, the guy did have a bad day. It was a crime of passion. So,the Angel announced, "Ok, sir. Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven," and let him in.   A few seconds later the next guy came up. The Angel said, "Before I can let you in, I need to hear about what your day was like when you died."   "No problem," said the second man. "But you're not going to believe this. I was on the balcony of my 26th floor apartment doing my daily exercises. Having been under a lot of pressure I was really pushing hard to relieve my stress. I guess I got a little carried away, slipped, and accidentally fell over the side! Luckily, I was able to catch myself by the fingertips on the balcony below mine. But all of a sudden this crazy man comes running out of his apartment, started cussing, and stomps on my fingers. Well, of course I fell. I hit some trees and bushes at the bottom which broke my fall so I didn't die right away. As I'm laying there face up on the ground, unable to move, and in excruciating pain, I see this guy push his refrigerator, of all things, off the balcony. It falls the 25 floors and lands on top of me, killing me instantly."   The Angel is quietly laughing to himself as the man finishes his story. "I could get used to this new policy," he thinks to himself. "Very well," the Angel announces. "Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven," and he lets the man enter.   A few seconds later, a third man comes up to the gate. The angel says," Please tell me how you died." The third man says,"Ok, picture this. I'm naked, hiding inside a refrigerator...."

      Well I found a home for my Dog. He'll have 2 kids to run around and play with and 5 acre's and a new dog to play with. I know he will be well taken care of but I am so upset that I had to give him up. Is that wrong? I hate to see him go and I could go visit him but I know I can't it will be to hard for me. He was such a good dog we were always together I took him everywhere and now a part of me is gone. I hate it. I dunno what to do with myself I just hope he knows it wasn't his fault and he didn't do anything wrong.  I love him so much.

       urlLink Selena - Dreaming of You Lyrics : "Late at night when all the world is sleeping. I stay up and think of you. And I wish on a star, That somewhere you are thinking of me too.  *'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight Till tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be Than here in my room dreaming about you and me.  Wonder if you ever see me, and I Wonder if you know I'm there If you looked in my eyes, Would you see what's inside? Would you even care?  I just wanna hold you close But so far, all I have are dreams of you So I wait for the day, and the courage to say How much I love you. (yes I do)  Repeat *  corazon, i can't stop dreaming of you, no puedo dejar de pensar en ti, i can't stop dreaming, como te nesesito, i cant stop dreamind of you, mi amor como teextrano  Late at night when all the world is sleeping I stay up and think of you And I still can't believe That you came up to me and said I love you I love you too  Now I'm dreaming with you tonight Till tomorrow and for all of my life And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be Than here in my room dreaming with you endlessly (ad lib to fade) "

      My apartment complex just decided to refuse to sign a new lease with me unless I get rid of my dog. Fucking bastards. I have had my dog here for a year and they approved him wtf is their problem??? Thinking about taking them to court but I don't think I would win because they have the right not to let me sign a new lease for no reason right? I dunno I'm not sure about that one. Plus I didn't tape the conversation I had with the manager when she told me it was because of the dog. So I can't prove that stupid me. I  haven't found a home for him yet but I'm looking I refuse to take him to the pound because thats like sending him to his death bed.   I am moving to Indiana in 8 months!!! Finally I get to be with my boyfriend.  We are getting married in December 2005 !!! Hopefully if all goes as planned. It has been a bitch since he left here :(    Everyone hope I find a good home for my dog. Thanks.
