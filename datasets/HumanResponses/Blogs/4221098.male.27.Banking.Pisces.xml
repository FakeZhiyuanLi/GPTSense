						   Would someone please tell me why I'm always into my cups when it's time to write?  Why I'm always a few sheets into the wind?  And where did that particular idiom come from?  Sheets into the wind? Was it from some poor sloshed fool whose job it was to put up the laundry only he was so toasted that he didn't put the linens up correctly and when the wind picked up they flew off, to the great amusement of the local villagers?  hmph  My problem is simple.  I created this Place to get political frustrations off my chest, only I've found that a few brews do the same thing, only more expensively.  I'm very politically opinionated, and my co-workers are immune to argument.  I'm not.  My opinions have shifted greatly over the years, and I guess that I'm thinking that most of the people around me are set in their ways.  Maybe they are and maybe they aren't.  After two decades of friendship with Pete and five years of working with Gerard and Cameron, I've come to the conclusion that most of humanity doesn't like their stances undermined.  I used to enjoy doing that.  Now, I've found that when people are shown how loose the mortar of their convictions is, they just throw more paint on top of it, neglecting the fundamental instability that lurks in their foundation.  I can't reach them, and over years that failure has told me a couple of things, one: I lack the capability to fully and eloquently pitch my side of the argument, or two: that they aren't willing to listen.  And ultimately I've begun to question if I can even make any difference at all. You've got to start small right?  I still have yet to start it seems.  Movies: Alien Vs Predator Saw it Saturday evening with my mother.  It was a fun, fun movie.  Not the best film on the planet but it was good enough to get the audience cheering at parts when it called for it, heh.  In other words it was good action.  Started slow but eventually it sped up to a frenzied pace then let you down easy.  My verdict: If all you know of Aliens or the Predator is from the movies, you will be surprised.  Rentals: Bad(der) Santa Was pretty silly and when it got to the chapter 13-14 break the PS2 nutted up and wouldn't play any more.  Unable to Read Disc it says. Damn.  Rentals: The Human Stain  Yet another movie that Pete rented and walked out from.  I thought it was nicely made, although the thought of Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman in a torrid affair gives me the jibblies.  At first I imagined it was based on a Stephen King short story, but once it was done I was convinced it wasn't, since there wasn't any horror component, just simple human stupidity. Bleh.  SoulCalibur 2 Sunday Sunday Sunday fight Kilik over Raphael, me Spawn over Cervantes, me Maxi over Taki, Pete Lizardman over Ivy, me  Pete says he's used to the thumbstick, and that he was using it on Wednesday when he tore me to shreds, but if today was any indication, I dunno.  We were both drinking during the fights....  By the way, I may be changing jobs in the near future.  If this happens, it will be around twice my pay and working in the daytime.  It's a job that's too good to be true but I'm willing to do it.  Go through the change that is.  Hopefully their need for someone in banking is equivalent with my need to get the hell away from this pittance I make.  We'll see, won't we?  Boy, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon!

						   I always get morning amnesia when I stay over at my folks's.  I think they're going to treat me to the Bourne Supremacy if I stay for a little bit longer today.  I had been planning to take mother to Alien Versus Predator, but father had other plans for us for today.   Last night was interesting.  Co-worker Cameron had taken the day off.  Sickly boy.  So It was basically up to Gerard and me to get the work done.  Co-worker Al was taking the night as easy as it can be taken and my boss John was also very diligently knocking down those barbaric and cunning solitaire card.  That's okay.  They got out early.  I had to work late, and since any delay in the chain ends up pushing my work back, I ended up leaving maybe 3 hours after Gerard and Al, when it's usually 2.  Actually it'll end up showing on the old paycheck.  But OT is adjusted on next month's check.  I have to be patient, heh.  It's good to know Dr Formisano isn't dead.   urlLink http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/18.html   Hopefully next month, he'll be there off the coast of Italy at the conference with NASA to get them to see the truth about the 'extant' life on Mars.  Bah.  NASA is run by bureaucrats now.  There's no vision like they had even 20 years ago.  And the Pres. Bush wants NASA to take us back to the Moon and Mars?  I would subsidize the private sector if I was Pres.  Hopefully we're all around to see it.  I have mixed feelings about 2012, thank you Mayans.

						   Sonuva...  Well the Soulcalibur 2 8 match fight went not so well.  Pete wasn't drinking and umm... I was. Bud Light 6-pack. He said he felt hung-over from the night before, pfft!  He was up 6 to 2 when the dust settled!  Anyhow, here's the breakdown:  Yoshimitsu over Spawn, Pete Mitsurugi over Necrid, Me Maxi over Talim, Pete Taki over Assassin, Me Ivy over Kilik, Pete Cervantes over Knightmare, Pete Voldo over Cassandra, Pete Seung Mina over Lizardman, Pete  We nearly exhausted our portfolio of characters in the damn game; we both play half of the however many playable characters the game offers.  Tonight I just wasn't on top of my game.  The fights were all close; don't get me wrong.  Maybe I psyched myself out, drinking while he was staying sober.  I know I was sweating up a storm; it was a muggy night.  After that we watched Seven, always a good standby.  Almost as good as the Matrix, heh.  Morrowind is beginning to bug me.  I played EQ for three years, DAOC for one year, AO for one year, E&B for almost a year, played Neverwinter Nights through, a few Final Fantasy games through... you'd think I'd be done with the whole fantasy genre, but no.  I'm comfortable with RPG's of the fantasy persuasion, it's just that Morrowind is so damn particular about some things.  The fighting system is real bland, and there's no way to tell the experience level of whatever you're thinking about killing.  That doesn't matter because you can kill most anything in the game from the get-go if you have enough potions on you to keep you fighting.  And then again you don't really need to kill to advance in experience; you can buy yourself training in skill, so what's the problem?  I dunno. It's a fresh take (to me anyways) on the fantasty RPG and I should learn to enjoy it right?  We'll see, I guess.  Boy I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon!

						   Tonight went as well as most Sunday nights... Well maybe not as well.  The d-pad on my beloved Airflow XBOX controller just gave up the ghost.  That would normally not be something to infuriate me however, except that Pete was using it in the middle of our 8 match SoulCalibur 2 Sunday Sunday Sunday fight.  Long story short, I resigned our match shortly after it broke.  Ivy over Kilik Talim over Voldo Maxi over Taki (Taki resigns)  We then move on to our movie rentals, Hidalgo and The Whole Ten Yards.  Hidalgo was very very nicely done.  The Whole Ten Yards however... Let's just say that I can't recall the last time Pete called it a night and just walked out it the middle of a movie.  I mean it had it's cute parts but hell, he's the one who rented it!  Oh well, more Morrowind for me.  I'm a few hours into it and can sense some potential.  Maybe it's not as bad as I imagined it to be.  Nah that's too harsh.  I was prejudiced by watching Pete play it up till last week. It's a well put together game and I've been spoiled by too much eye candy in the past few years ;)   Coast to Coast AM is on with Barbara Simpson hosting and a couple of really cool folks guesting.  They're into Coptic scriptures and the show is about ancient civilizations communicating with each other during the time the pyramids were built.  http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/15.html  I will always be interested in our history regarding the time when writing was supposedly invented.  What exactly was going on?  I mean Sumer and Ur are one thing, but red-haired mummies in Egypt and pyramids in Japan say that folks back then were more worldly than for what I think history books give them credit.  Boy, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon!

						   300 hours  I'm at home and set up this blog.  Still getting used to the idea of doing this.  Fortunately, beer helps with every decision!  Coast to Coast AM with George Noory is on with Kevin Warwick as the guest.  http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2004/08/12.html  Also, I'm reading from the Reluctant Messenger website.  It will BEND your mind!  My recommendation: Read the story first, then go further and check out the other aspects of religions later.  http://reluctant-messenger.com/  The funny thing is that Co-worker Gerard turned me on to it and when earlier tonight I threw some thoughts at him that the Reluctant Messenger site confirms aspects of reality I gained from my own Discernment, he kinda gave me that 'You're Crazy' look that I love to get from him, heh heh.  Gerard is your quintessential Protestant and Co-worker Cameron, who's closer to my age, was raised Catholic like me and could do nothing more than stare slack-jawed during the above interchange.  Man,it was good.  Thinking of a signature... should go with the one from the good old days of EQ... 'Boy, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon!' Good times... hee hee    'Boy, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon!'
