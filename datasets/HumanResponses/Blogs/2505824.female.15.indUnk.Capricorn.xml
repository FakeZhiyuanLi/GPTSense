      For instance....Omelets.  When one talks to me about a omelet, I think of Hamlet, soooo two different images come to mind.  One is an ham omelet.  The second is Ben Alshire wrapped up in egg screaming.  The Ben one comes more often than not.  But the point is......the point is that instead of killing whales for their blubber, we should instead give them liposuction.  Therefore we have our blubber, and the whales are nice and trim.  Though the whale aerobic instructors might be a little miffed.  But they can suck it up and get another job like.....I don't know....plumbing??  Well that's all, good bye all my little grape vines in humus.  Nora a.k.a- the whaling liposuction surgeon naturalist.

      Wellllllllllllll.........tis a loverly day, but I wouldnt know cuz I dont have a lover but thats allllll besides the point. The point is.......the point is the dolphins dont like sea water, but they only like to live there because they like the free salt for their margaritas.  That the only reason they act so stupid and allow us to screw with their minds.  But thats not the point either........what the hell are you looking at me like that????  Does it look like I know the point.  For someone who thinks dolphins are alcoholics you sure have a lot of faith in me.  Gezzz.........*walks off muttering...then 800 lb wreaking ball swings down and kills her.  Aplause fallows.*   (the following is from Logan since she isn't on her own computer.) Hiya all!   mesa is having fuuuun....weeeeee.   Aww nori...I'll be your lover!!  oops...I've said that to WAY to many people, I'll have to start making commitments!   damn...oh well, love you all anyway!

      So tommarow is Valentine's day at MRU. Aka "massive PDA / mad sex-ified hormone filled teenagers day"  For those of you lucky lucky children who have never had to experiance this attrocity, let me explain.  The torture starts in the morning. You walk into the building, and trip over middleschoolers sucking face in the lobby. you ram into them everywhere you go. finnily, after you manage to fight your way past all the sex crazed mutants, you get to TA (aka, homeroom). Here, you are presented with carnations, sold by the NHS. If you have a boy friend, or a just a friend, who cares about such things, you get massive ammounts of these icky smelling things. If you have no friends, you get one from the NHS that says "Happy Valentine's day, from a friend." This is supposed to make you feel better about not having anyone who's willing to spend a dollar on you. however, it acctually makes you feel like crap. 'cause if you carry around a carnation "from a friend", then everyone knows that you have no friends. whereas, if you don't carry any carnations around at all, it just looks like you got lots and stuck them in your locker. This whole thing was much more of a problem in middleschool, when i actually cared about what everyone thought...But according to Hannah, who has had the very unfortunate experiance of having freeky mutant guys, who she dosn't know, send her tons of carnations, teddybears, roses, and chocolates, getting a carnation "from a friend" is acctually not the worst thing that can happen to you.  So after TA, which you spend inching away from the couples making out in the corners, or, for that matter, in the center of the room, you fight your way to your first class. This is made very difficult by the fact that the sex crazedcouples have multiplyed, and their actions have progressed to acctual R-rated groping. They do this in the center of the hall, and in the center of the stairwell. Why, i don't know. It's some sort of odd physical phenomion - the center off the hall way is apparently better for making-out than the sides of the hallway. so after smashing through the hormone landmine zone, and arriving at your first class, you are greeted with some strangely over enthusiastic teacher who gives everyone little sugary heart candys that say "hot stuff" and "love 4ever" on them. They taste like toothpaste.  It goes on like this all day. The hormones rage higher on a flood of sugar and SEX, and when you fight your way to the bathroom, you find 10 girls in there, sobbing thier eyes out. Apparently their offerings of love, or shall we say, infatuation, have been shunned. Or the man of their dreams has been spotted chewing on someone elses tounge. (sorry for the god awful discriptions, but this is really what they do.).  At lunch, you are surrounded by couples sitting in eachothers laps, and yet more tounge chewing and sobbing girls. It's enough to make you loose your appitite. Plus, you notice that all the ugly middle school girls seem to have boyfriends, and you don't. Not that you really want to add to the mess, but it's slightly depressing anyway.  By the end of the day, the PDA is really x-rated. and the wailing girls have given up on the line for the bathroom, and are instead crying it all out infront of their lockers, while a group of their friends try to console them by saying bad things about "that jerk."   and the janators are left to clean up piles of smushed candy hearts and rotten flowers.   ~Rosilita, the bitter and sarcastic, but otherwise content

      This is horrible.  there are those stupid ads on kings of chaos, and one that comes up alot  is this thing about breast cancer, saying that so many thousand women will get it in the next year and 40,000 will die.  And i know that my mom was one of those women who got it, and she was lucky to get rid of it. and my aunt nancy will be one of those women who dies, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.  And then they have another ad that says, "are you over 21 and do you smoke? win a TV!"  What is wrong with the world?  ok, i have to stop writing about this now because it's really depressing and if i don't stop i'm gonna start crying. ~laura aka the cannibal

      Has anyone noticed how anvil and advil are spelled similar and sound similar?  So like if you go to a drug store and ask for advil and they throw an anvil at you then....since you would probably be dead...would that count as a pain reliever?

      Wheaton Squier: it's an art Meghan Faulkner: ok, whatever you say, but anyone can procrastinate, on;y the truly talented can get it done early Wheaton Squier: .....yeah Wheaton Squier: but it can still be considered am art Meghan Faulkner: HOW??? Wheaton Squier: anyone can spatter pain on a canvas and call it art 9:40 PM Wheaton Squier: hang on Wheaton Squier: fine then Meghan Faulkner: how is it art Wheaton Squier: how is it not? Meghan Faulkner: it does not involve creating anything new, it is an act, there is no final product Wheaton Squier: ah Wheaton Squier: there is nothing Wheaton Squier: and that is what you are trying to get Meghan Faulkner: yes Wheaton Squier: nothing is the product Meghan Faulkner: but then it is not an art form, because a product is something not nothing Meghan Faulkner: right? Wheaton Squier: no Meghan Faulkner: i think? Wheaton Squier: anything can be art Meghan Faulkner: but it has to be something not nothing Wheaton Squier: why? 9:45 PM Meghan Faulkner: because you just said anything can be art, but to be anything it has to be something nothing Wheaton Squier: nothing is something Meghan Faulkner: no nothing is nothing Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: we will say that nothing is nothing Wheaton Squier: nothing can still be art Meghan Faulkner: thank you Wheaton Squier: if you had a blank canvas, what is it? Meghan Faulkner: if that is what you want to be believe, so be it Wheaton Squier: is it something? Meghan Faulkner: the beginnings of art Wheaton Squier: not the canvas Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: so we have the beginning of art Wheaton Squier: is that something? Meghan Faulkner: yes but not art Wheaton Squier: so if i said "that's art" what would you say? 9:50 PM Meghan Faulkner: no, because it was not made by human hands, did you grow the flax or whatever and weave it, and all of that fun stuff Wheaton Squier: so it's not you're saying? Meghan Faulkner: yes, i'm saying that it is not Wheaton Squier: okay Wheaton Squier: but you have me the "artist" who is saying that in-fact that IS art and who are you to say it's not? Meghan Faulkner: if you created it, maybe it is art, but if you go buy a canvas, display it, and whatever, it is not art!!!!! Wheaton Squier: so i can't proclaim the blank canvas art 9:55 PM Meghan Faulkner: not unless you created it Wheaton Squier: is a parakeet paints something is it art? Meghan Faulkner: yes, it created it Meghan Faulkner: i think Wheaton Squier: okay, so if i covered my canvas with paint and then scraped it all off Wheaton Squier: is that art Meghan Faulkner: no, it was, but you destroyed it Wheaton Squier: no Meghan Faulkner: if there were holes or scrape marks, it might be Wheaton Squier: i say that if that's what i was trying to do then it's art Meghan Faulkner: if you purposefully created them Meghan Faulkner: yes Wheaton Squier: so if i purposely left it blank... Meghan Faulkner: NO!!!!!!!!!!!! Wheaton Squier: WHY NOT???? Wheaton Squier: i can say it is Wheaton Squier: that's what i want to portray Wheaton Squier: i blank canvas Meghan Faulkner: yes, but maybe i don't agree with you 10:00 PM Wheaton Squier: oh yes i know that Wheaton Squier: so if you see it in a museum next to other things what would you call ot Meghan Faulkner: i would silently wonder what the heck it is there for Wheaton Squier: heh heh heh Meghan Faulkner: but, if you become a famous artist, with blank canvases, yeah, right, i'd support you Wheaton Squier: wow Wheaton Squier: we need to argue in person sometime  -wheaton AKA the blank one.....

Will seek him out and have a long chat about the great things in life....I'm sure he'll agree with me on what those things are.  But I will NOT stalk him like someone else we know might ::coughcoughcarissacoughcough::  ::coughs turn to hacks, then weezes, collapses to the floor, dies...again:: Is it possible to die more then one time?

      I have tea and chocoalte cake.   the world is a wonderful place...  on the way to CT on saturday, i saw a billboard (*gasp* horrible ugly things!) with a picture of the originial really big green monster thing that nate pasted wheaton's face on.  (note rosie's total lack of pop-culture...i'm guessing it was a movie monster?).  anyway, i saw that and i went "HA!"  good story rosie, good story... in other news,  today laura and i talked to logan about bunnies.  and slash.  and such. it was ammusing.  laura was shock-ed.  i was not.   and that was that.  i'm sorry, i'm really trying here, but you know, nothing of any importance and/or intrest is jumping to mind (why do we say jumping?  why not "swiming to mind?"  walking?  strolling?  tiptoeing?)  ah well, some one else should try this updating thing sometime...

So, if you had a dream that you and.....uh, huh...ok, Betty Crocker...(hahahaha! How great! so random!) were baking brownies together, would Betty Crocker be sleeping in her bed, dreming about baking brownies with some freak, AKA: you?  Just a though I had.

I have nothing to do...Wheeee-boring. People need to call or IM me and make times so I have something to do with people other then stay up till 2 and sleep till noon...it gets very boring very quickly. Not to mention tiring.   My typing's go to hell today...pay no mind to any blantant typos.  The baot's in the water...it was so gorgeous at the lake today. We didn't have time to sail, but the water was all choppy and the wind was blowing hard across the lake, and it was cold, so I sat on the dock's end and got splashed on by waves and watched the golden sunset...days like today are great. It was so awesome to see Crown Point ruins bathed in gold light...and seagulls...and water...and dammit...I wanted my camera. Byut it was at home... :(  I'm gonna leave now...but I'll be on for awhile.   T.Y.L- (Ta You Lot) Carissa, the overly-eccentric.

      Ok so here is a question, I appreciate all replies.  Have you ever been in love, and how many times? Was the other person i love with you too, and which times? What is being in love? Do you think a person can be in love more than once, or is there one special someone for everyone?  Elaborate, I just wander what your guys opinions on this are.  Thanks! Oh and did you want my answers, if anyone does, say so I'll post mine too.

      Yeah, that'd be gravity.  Anyway, that has nothing to do with this post.  So hi to everyone, and Susannah especially, welcome!  Getting ready for exams, life sucks, in other words, however, I GET MY PERMIT IN 3 DAYS!!!! WHOOT WHOOT!!! And I drove a lot today...(illegally, but hey, little details...) and it went well, so i'm a happy camper. Well, I'm not a camper, unless my life is a camp, which sometimes I think it is. Boot Camp. How much can you handle at once, like hopping on one foot reciting the alphabet backwards at the same time while writing an English report, learning new French verb tenses for the exam, and saving a small third world country?  But anyway, that's not why I'm posting here either. I'm going to drive you crazy yet...  I'm posting to say that I'm sick to death of everything that goes on after one wins the UVM writing contest. Today, i was pulled out of lunch and the first ten minutes of ocial Studies to do an over-the-phone interview with a guy from the Rutland Herald. it took, I am not kidding you, half an hour. He wanted to know EVERYTHING!!! What the prompts were, what I wrote, what my hobbies were, what I wanted to major in college in, if I had anything I was writing on the side, if I was publishing it, what i had to eat for lunch exactly five months ago, and what my views on Capital Punishment are. (Haha.) Well, it was close to that, you can imagine. :P  I am so ready for this to be over. O-V-E-R! Realizing I don't LIKE to be noticed. That 'invisable girl' syndrome. It dies hard.  I smell like linament from the stable. Kinda weird. I went to blow my nose, and I was permeated by the smell of mint, and it made my nose tingle really weirdly. Ugh.   I think I'll be on all night. I have an English paper to write, (anyone know of a really important day in my life, cause I can't think of one...) and a French compostion. To do in three different verb tenses. Ah, for the days of only the present tense...i think i need to find an on-line translator...make my life easy. Hahaha...  As always, Mischief AKA: Carissa

Well if I can entertain myself for another hour and a half I can go ahead to work. You guys better take good care of Nathan up there! Or I'll have to float up in my invisible car that runs on love, right Nathan! Anyway I everyone is having a good summer so far, and that you guys aren't as bored as I am.

      Okay so you guys don't know who I am for the most part. Well nice to meet you all. My name is Susannah, I'm 19 and I live in Durham, NC. (Don't you always feel stupid talking about yourself) Anyway, I am out of highschool and currently work as a waitress at an adorable pizzaria. I'm a vegetarian, I'm outspoken, I talk to much, and I can get annoying. On the good hand though, I'm loyal, compassionante, and understanding. I like theatre, and have been dong it for 15 years, I am a middle child and I know the muffin man.....sorry I had to add that. I'm a little starnge, and "special" but aren't we all. Anything else you want to know go ahead and ask.  -Susannah

      Lately ive been thinking theoretically and philisophicaly alot about dating and relationships and other things.  I think some people want a perfect boyfriend/girlfriend and since that doesnt happen much the person tends to make someone they find they like a little perfect to them.  So my question is would you, personally, make a person change their ways, habits, looks, whatever to your version perfect person?   The answer to my own question is no.  I will accept the person for who they are, thats why i fell in love with them anyway isnt it? Personally im willing to accept a persons bad habits. No matter how bad they might be.  No one is perfect, and as  urlLink Susannah  said, "being perfect would be an imperfection." I'm assuming this posts comments will be more than alot of others, and people? dont argue in the comments please? Thanks  I can already smell vermont everyone.  -Nate A.K.A the mish mash balley smash tik-in-tash car crash

      Here's a quote from earlier today:    Mischief1689: It's like, destiny on crack.   Ever get that feeling, like fate's been smoking the wacky tabacky? I've been getting that feeling a lot lately. It either go stupidly well, or horribly wrong. It was wrong, now it's getting good. So, as I have stated, destiny either needs to lay off the coke, or become an addict. Not inbetween. Inbetween makes me all confuzzled.   I think I'm going on a posting craze today. This is my forth post today. Isn't that sad?  Nora, if you're visiting from over where the say  miff  and  tiff  , here's this for you: Wasn't it,: Give Me Back My Handbag, Bitch?  Har har har...

      I think we've all generally come to the conclusion that being a teenager just...well...it SUCKS.   thankfully, the entire population of the world, over the age of 13, shares this knowledge.  and the entire population of the world over the age of 20 has survived being a teenager.  all the nasty embarrassing moments, all the horrible heart breaks, all the weird and unflattering styles and fads that we choose to or choose not to participate in, all the crazy mood swings - they all survived it.  They've even learned to laugh about it.  Seeing all these adults who survived teenager-hood makes me realize that, as unlikely as it seems, it really does get better.  so hang in there children, we've got lots to look forward to! *wheee*

      It is the most beautiful and wonderful thing, but there is a dark side, a side we do not see. The side of when the love is gone, the absence of it and the fear you have that one day you will have to endure that absence. I fear I will not be strong enough. I sit and realize that 18 hrs away is driving me mad as I sit here alone watching tv, playing games, reading, making jewelry, eating, pacing, anything to keep me busy. It is funny that in me a know that I don't NEED Nathan to the point that it is a bad thing but I also know the luxury of seeing the world in color, instead of black and white and now when I go back to the mediocre past in which I once inhibited I am falling apart. I sit alone here, I can't turn to Jessica who is in Connecticut with Justin, I cannot turn to my parents who are in Arizona or my sister who is with them, not even my other sister who is with her love in Ohio. The world is suddenly empty and my house so large and spacious. Of course the dogs keep me company but it isn't the same. I guess I should go out to stay busy and go shopping or go just join the world but the world is a scary place and instead I sit hear in hopes that the phone will ring and Nathan will be on the other line telling me he thinks of me. I know he thinks of me all the time but I never tire of hearing about it. I should be being productive and cleaning or sorting or something but instead I sit in constant despair until my other half has returned. I need to sign up for some art classes or make more friends to fill but time. It is funny I am so alone now and bored but in just 2 days my family will return and I will be full of not a lonely but a chaotic pain. I will suffer the intolerable cruelty of listening to my family quarrel and my sister will be sad at some point and though I try to console her as does my mother then there is my father who just breaks down sometimes and gets so frustrated that I am reminded of crying in my room when I was 6 years as I heard my mother cry and I wished I could do something. Nathan is my prince charming and has come to save me, but this isn't a fairy tale and though I can pray that the ending will be happy I will still have this pain. Then there is my mother who has no one to turn to. She was so stressed this May her blood pressure got to 210 over something and I had to take her to the hospital. I worry, she watched her father die from a heart attack her there, and I don't want to see her suffer, she needs a shoulder to cry on, but so do I. No wander I go to therapy once a week, but anyone who goes knows that it never seems to be at the time you need it, for some reason the moments that you encounter your physciatrist/phsycologist is one of the moments in the week that you are ok. And so now I cry as I set down the phone, I hoped it was Nate but instead it's the Democratic part calling for donations. Can someone tell me why life is the way it is, I wish everyone could just give and be kind but instead we have hate and pain and sorrow, and it eats me up inside. But yet I hate to sit here and cry because then I am hurting the one person who brightens every moment without effort and I hurt my Nathan, for when I cry he feels my pain and then that hurts him and it hurts me more, but I hold back my tears and smile to know that he is happy so s once again am I. For if I dwell in sorrow I bring him it would only bring him more sorrow and thus continue this painful circle. I will see him in 2 hours most likely but it is never enough, I feel so greedy, and needy but I guess that is who I am, I just hope it is good enough, not for the world but for Nathan. It is hard, no matter how much I heal and continue I hold these scars in my soul and will carry them, because in reality dropping all of my baggage and sorrow would mean starting again and that is even scarier, because even though it may be less painful somehow this painful world is comforting because it is what I have always known. Yet I love it when it is gone when I am in Nathans arms and there are no troubles, the weight is gone, and for those moments I am truly happy, I guess I am just terrified of the thought that this feeling that I realize is more than any other I have ever felt could one day end and that is terrifying. It is scary to admit it but when I look back on everyone I have ever been with thought I loved or even perhaps did love, it was nothing like this, not even if I took what I had to them and put it to the 100th power would it compare to this to the way it feels when my lips touch Nathan and I feel him quiver in my arms and I know for that moment why we are here, why the world is so hard, because in fact this love is here. So if by chance it is all gone when I woke up tomorrow, this month and a half with Nathan in my life would have made years of suffering worthwhile but I don't want to go back ever, not now that I am here. Why would someone leave heaven to endure hell, thats the way it feels, I would never give this up, I would sooner throw all my possesions out the window and run away from it all then give up this feeling give up this love this passion that has taken me over. I sit here and type, I tell myself to stop but I can't express it not in a million words. I want to come one and just say what I've been up to but am overwhelmed with this feeling to share with the world the hope that exists that is there. So for those of you who have endured and read my long and senseless ranting take with you these words of advice, whatever pain you have undergone and continue to undergo there is hope there is love, when there is war and hate and murder there is love and hope so never give up, dream and enjoy every second because on one day you will look back and those little moments like singing along in the car and feeling awkward because you know your voice cracks and the person next to you can't take it, remember those moments are the moments we live for, those are the true moments that we truly LIVE.

      I need some assistants, I am currently compiling a basket for the Muffin Man's wife, I just heard news of his awful death, or atleast I think he is dead. WHEATON has eaten him, I need to perform surgery immediantly before it is too late, will someone tie Wheaton down for me? Carissa you would be good at that. WE MUST SAVE THE MUFFIN MAN!

      We need a waltz on here...I mean, c'mon, everyone needs to dance. And I'm in an incredibly silly mood.  blame the Monty Python overdose last night...but anyway. I also find it funny that the (only) one who DOESN'T know how to waltz is posting a *ahum* waltz. But yes,...sillyness.  [begins dancing...oops, no music yet...oh well...CARRY ON!!!]  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (and uh, one, and uh, two, and a three...) POST POST POST, POSTPOST. (one...two...three...four...) POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST. (oh, you get the hint by now!)  POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POST POST POST, POSTPOST. POSTPOSTPOSTPOST...POST.  PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-PO-POST!!! (exhuberent dancing ensues.)  Ok...maybe I don't waltz. Maybe I just leap around. But hey, someone only tried to teach me once. And when it's Nord...more just a matter of making sure you don't get stepped on/step on her.   Ahum...NORA COMES HOME FROM LONDON TODAY!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!  So now...go out and dance in front of people until they stare at you. It's fun!!!  Ta, Mischiefness!!!!
