      Story of my life really!  In a nutshell :- Meet a wonderful girl, get on like house on fire, start seeing each other, never have an argument, she moves back home (Germany), the guy she was cheating on her ex-boyfriend with comes back on the scene, she calls me the next day in tears to tell me (respect her for that), we decide (with 12 days to go) that I'm not going to visit her, German bloke tels her "I don't want you ever speaking/texting/e-mailing Andy again as I feel threatened by him!", She tells him to sod off that'll never happen, call her again, decide that I will go accross but shorten my stay and not go to Bremen, change flights all arranged with 4 days to go, and she is still asking me "Do you still want to come under these circumstances?" Of course I do! Here's me thinking what we have/had was alot more than just a sexual relationship. Yes I do love her more than I could describe, and yes my heart has been broken, all my friends say that I shouldn't go because I'll just get hurt. I am not going to get the relationship back on track, I am going to tell her how I feel about the whole thing, what I would like for the future, and to tell her as soon as she moves to Scotland (which she intends on doing regardless) to get in touch with me if she still loves me and then we'll see what might happen. I know the distance thing will never work between us unless we saw each other almost every month, which is not really finacially viable. I know I could do the distance and unless by some miricale, she only has feelings for me, the long distance relationship thing just will not work!  So is it a good idea to still go? I think it is. I'm not going expecting anything except to talk about what has happened and tell her my true feelings (as it can't be done over the phone) and I would actually really like to meet her family!! I sound really fucked up don't I! Ah well, we'll see what happens! Roll on Thursday

      Bunch of arse! How can people be so stupid? The minions under me have a very simple job, they get calls from the British public in relation to thier phones not working, and then they log the fault and that's it! I do the complicated stuff not them but they always seem to try to, and when they do they fuck things up royally and then I have to clean the mess up and speak to the very angry customers whose phones could've been fixed two days ago!!!!!!  NOT FUCKIN' HAPPY

      My project is starting to get off the ground, (with a little help from the wonderful Gordy at work) managment still don't know what I'm doing though. Tonight going round to see Nathan and watch a couple of movies and have some beers. Not heard from her yet, and don't expect her to call/txt/e-mail for some time either! Being that she's got her bloke thingy. Working alot at the momentand keeping my head busy with thoughts re: work things.  And that's about it I think! Oh, got that track thing recorded and should hear the final mix tonight. Don't you just love in-flight safety guides!

      So just read an e-mail from Martina, She has now got a boyfriend in the form of Christian (the guy she slept with while going out with me).  As you can imagine my heart has been removed from my body and has just been stomped on. She told him that she is still coming to Scotland and that she will be seeing me and that he has to deal with it. He says he is going to change and she is giving him the chance. I think I made her realise just how much I do love her, and that surprised her quite alot! Yes Martina I would leave my life in Scotland behind and move to Germany just so I can be with you, all you needed to do was ask! Told her what my concerns were as a friend and she assures me that if Christian doesn't change she will end it. Hmmmmm I guess I have to wait and see? That's another question!! Can I move on? Bad one to ask at the moment 'cos all I can think about is her!  Fuck I need to get drunk!

      She's highly stressed, combination of family fighting, uni not going well and friends dumping their problems on her.  Turns out not only are her ex-boyfriends jealous/threatened by me so is her mother! Her father thinks I'm ace but her mother thinks that if we stayed together Martina would move to Scotland to be with me! (she's going to do this anyway, she just hasn't told her mum yet!) Her university thing is just a pile of pish, she has to do some nigh on impossible tests so she can do the end of year exam and go onto the next year. She has failed one of these test already! Now I would say I'm good at finishing sentances but these questions she was asked were ridiculous, even I couldn't do it!! So her next idea (which I like) is to complete the Art side of her course (1 Years worth) get her degree in that, and then finish her English side of the course (2 years worth) in .......... you guessed it.......... Aberdeen.  Now I'm not really one for following my Zodiac and what not, but everything written in them over the past few days have came true and all is good. On another subject (me) I find out tomorrow if I can go ahead and do some proper research into the little project that I have in mind at work, which could take me to Germany for testing. More on that tomorrow night I think, and I might tell you what it is aswell.  Till then life (mentally and future) is looking damn good and I am happy so sue me!  Oh and something else ........... got some lyrics done and more tunz have been given to me to work on, hopefully get some recording next week at some point. (I will be a super EBM front man one day god dammit!!!!)

      short version of events:- HOLIDAY:- Absolutly brilliant!!!! only a one hour delay going out, found out my dodgy ear is still dodgy, Martina was there to greet me! Spent most the time just talking (but not about the past of us!) we ended up kissing and making up, which was ace, we are still both single however and i think until we both live in the same country that is the way it will stay, that was my idea, get me being all grown up and sensible. flight back - BASTARDS that's all I can say! Piolet 'mis approached the runway' so we stayed in the air for a further 15 minutes, making me late for the last conecting flight back home by 2 minutes........ me not sodding happy. So I spend the night in lovely Luton. Great. Get back the next day with no money and rent to pay, Bollox. Cat has to go to the vet, Bollox. Gas and electricty bills are in, Bollox. I didn't get all my holiday pay, Bollox. Why the hell did I leave Germany??????????????? So I'm skint and a bit depressed and highly emotional........... More to come

      So whats been happening? Not heard from the Germany in over 10 days! Think I feel ok but I still can't stop thinking about her. Have refused to get involved with a few people over the last couple of weeks, not sure why, no one seems to take my fancy. I guess my standards and what I look for now are well out of reach. Now I am starting to her the words 'You're gonna die alone!' echoing in the back of my head. Ah well never mind. Other news ......... got myself a new place to live now and I'm gonna be on my own, (except for the cats of course!)  this is it first floor right as you look at the front door, middle and right hand windows sre mine.  &nbsp;  urlLink http://www-h.aspc.co.uk/cgi-bin/public/LiveProperty/221001   sign the lease on Friday.

      spoek to her last night, she is going to visit her parents soon and is taking her bloke. She has told her parents not to mention the fact that I was there only 6 weeks ago, So ineffect I no longer exsist in the Hoffmann family!!!! Well I feel fucking ace. She hasn't told him that she's staying at mine 'cos he'll get mad and they will have an arguement. This is the guy who said he is going to change! Bollocks...... Think I'm just going to curl up and hide in a corner for the rest of my life. I have lost alot emotionally and physically and I'm sick and tired trying to figure out what she thinks. Already I'm ready to say the final goodbye...... But I think I'll wait till she leaves Scotland.

      Still awaiting full access to work systems, but it's getting there. My boss said that she would have me cover her duties anytime, 'cos I'm ace! but I can't because I'm a contractor. If I don't find a flat in three weeks I'm homeless. And I have to work so much over the next few months. Life Sucks!!!!  How's yours?

      Speaking with Jimsin and he has kinda re-assured me og a few things, mainly about me more than what has been happening in my emotional rollercoaster of a life I am having at the moment!!!!  Still thinking lots about stuff though. Spoke to the German and she sounds happy, things must be going well with her and her bloke. Haven't asked her how things are with, probably never will!  Still get really nervous just before I call her, Heart almost stopping and hectic breathing and all that type of stuff, still can't get her out my head either. Do I still love her as much as i did?  I think i can safely say that I do.  Ah well, guess we'll just have to wait 4.5 weeks to find out how this story ends.

On her:- she's going to be staying at mine for five nights in total AND she invited me on a weekend away! (bit of a head fuck don't you think?)  Can't get thoughts straight at the moment and will be telling all to Jimsin, my head sorter outer.  More soon as I'm here all week!!!
