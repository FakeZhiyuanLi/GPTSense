      Today brought a new meaning to let it rain. I woke up today and it was pouring rain, I got dressed as I had to meet someone ^_^. Ack too nervous to eat, I went to the bus :-p.. praying for my life 'cause I was going to surrey :P. Anyways I bussed there everything went fine and I had a VERY good time [ i'm leaving this vague so I get the joy of questions from people who actually read my blog ]. I had to lie to get there but it was all good. Anyways :-p I had a good dinner and yeah here   I am now. Poo anywho this morning after I woke up the rain reminded me of a song. Haha I know it's corny and everything but when I was a little kid my mom used to always listen to amanda marshall, sheryl crow and stuff like that :p So anyways.. It reminded me of Amanda Marshall - Let it Rain. Haha so the songs been in my head all day. Anyways i'm gonna get back to chatting with all you people :-p... Ciao

       Not quite sure what to say. I have abandoned my xanga because this looks prettier [ wow that was superficial ]. It's finally cloudy out but not enough for rain ( i've been waiting for rain a LONG time ). Yesterday I went Skytraining with debra. For those of you who don't know what Skytraining is I will give an explanation. Skytraining is when you get on a skytrain and go to random places. We went to MetroTown and Pacific Centre/Granville Station. I bought jeans and a shirt at metro town which look good [ my reasoning for buying them ]. After arriving at Granville station we decided we would try and get to Granville Island [ which isn't even a real island ]. We got on The Number 4 Bus which said Powell, needless to say this was a huge mistake as we ended up in the Downtown Eastside. Walking what seemed forever and avoiding scary homeless people we made it back to Granville street. Where we joyously walked uphill 10 blocks [ which was great for my already aching bones ]. We stopped at subway and split a veggie delite sub which was delicious and then walked the rest of the way to Granville Station. Then we walked through Pacific Centre and skytrained to Debra's. After a quick family guy episode or two my mother picked me up. Then I had salad for dinner and watched The Secret Window. Anyways I'm off to do uhh stuff and make my blog known. I am a blogger 8-.

      Hello fellow prisoners, once again it's me [ oh joy ]. Anyway, back to my life. Last night Cassy [ my cousin ] came over and no I do not hate her, my family is ok [ minus the father ]. We talked for a while, laughed at idiots and then I left her to socialize with her friends who are still in their little superficial bubble ( they don't realize there's no point in trying ). I just realized, I'm usually not this way in real life :-p. So I guess you guys get the pleasure in seeing behind the mask. Back to last night... Cassy and me stayed up 'til around 3:40 am or so [ yes staying up late runs in the family, once again minus the old, stupid/arrogant father ]. We had crystal light and home made egg mcmuffins [ much to my delite ]. Anyways I woke up today and went back to sleep [ finally dragging my sorry ass out of bed around 1:30 ]. I had a shower and did the usual routine of getting up for the day [ hygiene is important, more people  should  use deoderant ]. I see that many other people on here have pictures of themselves, I know it's bad to conform but I wanted a picture none the less. So I tried taking some, much to my dismay I see that my photogenicness has died [ along with my beloved labtop power supply ]. Well anyways after an hour and a half of mindnumbing television I am here now. I'm going to go entertain myself and try to convince myself I shouldn't care about my looks. Ciao.
