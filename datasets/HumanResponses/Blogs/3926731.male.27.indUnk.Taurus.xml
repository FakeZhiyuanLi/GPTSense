      Walking past the television, I noticed the words  urlLink Power Rangers . It dawned on me that it was no longer the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, but some other "new and hip" name. This is when I decided to dive head first into the world of the "Rangers" to see exactly how many types there were. Of course, I found out!  &nbsp;     Mighty Morphin Power Rangers    Power Rangers Zeo    Power Rangers Turbo    Power Rangers in Space    Power Rangers Lost Galaxy    Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue    Power Rangers Time Force    Power Rangers Wild Force    Power Rangers Ninja Storm    Power Rangers Dino Thunder    I have realized that there just aren't enough Power Rangers shows at the moment, so I've decided to add my own, with a synopsis. (  Send in your Power Ranger show ideas!   )      Power Rangers ER  &nbsp; (The Rangers are at it again, this time twarting the evil deeds of Disease, Pestilence, Injury, and Self-Inflicted Wounds. Watch as the emergency room turns from a haven for those in immediate care to a battleground.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranger :  &nbsp;"That doctor is trying to stick that syringe in that kid!"&nbsp; Doctor : "It's an IV!"      Power Rangers&nbsp;   urlLink   Walnut Grove    &nbsp;  (Tossed back in time, the Rangers are forced to start a life on the prairie land of Walnut Grove. As the Blue Ranger finds himself falling&nbsp;for an older Mary Ingalls, the other Rangers realize that Olsen's Mercantile hasn't received the shipment of new&nbsp;china&nbsp;from Mankato.)&nbsp;      Power Rangers    urlLink   Regal Beagle      Fiasco &nbsp;  (Set in the late 70's, the Rangers find themselves rubbing elbows with Jack, Crissy, and Janet. Everything is fine and dandy until Larry devises a quick scheme to make money from a fake deed to the Regal Beagle. Can the Rangers save the pub? Will Jack's secret of being a straight man be safe with the Rangers? Don Knotts stars as Mr. Furley in this 1 hr special episode.)      Power Rangers    urlLink   Hollywood Squares    &nbsp; ( The Rangers make their debut on one of televisions funniest evening game shows. Others on the show include&nbsp; urlLink JM J. Bullock ,  urlLink Richard Simmons , and&nbsp;Gilbert Godfrey. "I'll take Richard Simmons to block!")      Power Rangers in the   urlLink  Land of Make-Believe    urlLink &nbsp;  (To defend the Land of Make-Believe, the Rangers set out to destroy the carousel and Lady Elaine Fairchild. When the inhabitants of the Land get on the trolley, they realize that a bomb is strapped to it. If any try to get off or it goes below 55mph all will perish in a ball of fire. Can the Pink Ranger keep it going?)      Power Rangers Redneck Raindrops  &nbsp; (After a call from the Texas Ranger, the Ranger team sets out to save the farm from a group of backwoods boys that make the kid from  urlLink Deliverance  look as hot a Brad Pitt and as calm as painter,  urlLink Bob Ross )     &nbsp;

      Okay, so dad gets a brand, spanking new kidney about a month ago and the weirdest thing&nbsp;is beginning to happen. I guess I better give some background to this story before I continue. &nbsp; The past few years have been a little awkward around the house. Since dad's original set of kidneys went bad, he's been going to dialysis. For those of you who don't know what that is, I'll explain. At dialysis, you sit for hours in a chair while blood is being pumped out of your body through an artery, cleaned and filtered, and then pumped back in through a vein. Sounds to me like a vampire who likes to recycle. &nbsp; Things around the house were a little strange even before all of this happened. Since dad also has had open heart surgery, the docs put him on blood thinner to keep the clogging of his arteries down to a minimum. Blood thinner does all kinds of interesting things to a person. One of those interesting things is how they perceive the temperature around them. &nbsp; Since the introduction of these "thinners" into his bloodstream, our house has seemed like it should belong near the equator....of the Sun!!! For those of you who have been lucky to come over, you understand. The rest of you will have to take my word for it. I've seen people walk in and sweat as soon as the breeze of the closing door subsided. There have even been times where I have longed to get into my underpants and fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol, hoping that the evaporating effects would help make the house more bearable.  &nbsp; Back to the story at hand. I have no idea who's kidney that the docs gave my father, but I'm pretty sure that they lived either in Canada or maybe even Siberia. Maybe it was from a friendly Eskimo. Who knows? All I know is that the words "son, could you turn the air down a little more" have been bombarding me and I don't know what to do. At first I was complaining about the heatwaves and the wildfires that danced in the living room hand in hand. Now, we can hang meat anywhere in the house. I was able to find my window scraper in order to clean off this monitor. Oh, and thank goodness for deicer! By the way, we've got Ground Beef for $0.99 per pound this week and Chuck Roast for $3.49.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       urlLink Willie Wonka  once said, "Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker!". Sorry Mr. Wonka, but I'll have to disagree. You see both statements are wrong! To prove my point, we are going to take a small trip into times past and venture to my childhood.  &nbsp;  You see, Saturday morning wasn't just any regular morning. It would consist of only 3 stations that actually showed Saturday morning cartoons. That's right, the USA Cartoon Express didn't run on Saturdays for those of you nay-sayers!  &nbsp;  I would wake up at 6am, prepared to watch my favorite shows. I have a sister and she and I would sometimes disagree on the cartoon to watch, so waking up early gave me the advantage of being the "Wielder of the Remote". Like any great power, there comes a consequence with it.  &nbsp;  Superman had to disguise himself. Batman had to live in a cave. Of all real consequences, mine was the worst. I had to watch something called the "Georgia Farm and Home Show". It would come on right after the pledge of&nbsp;allegiance, the  urlLink Star Spangled Banner , and some air show with the  urlLink Blue Angels . This must have been a form of alarm clock for a lot of people! LOL  &nbsp;  The Georgia Farm and Home Show was literally a young child's hell on earth. There would be two to three people in some barren production studio wearing what looked like shirts and pants made of sackcloth or thick canvas. Notably, you would occasionally see the green-colored jeans. They would sit there discussing boll weevils, pesticides, different types of crops, and other non-cartoon related items. To top it all off, they would even show slides of this stuff. Thankfully,&nbsp;the show&nbsp;was only 30 minutes long.  &nbsp;  The fires of this so-called hell would not die down so easily. Right after the GA Farm and Home Show was over, Satan's gift to the world would be shown. It was affectionately called...  &nbsp;     urlLink  T  H  E   N  E  W   Z  O  O   R  E  V  U  E   !         &nbsp;  This had to be the worst show ever made, hands down. If you think there is a worse show, send me a comment. I guarantee that if you've seen this crap, you'll have nothing to send.  &nbsp;  Well, after that atrocity to mankind was over, the good stuff would come on. That was when cartoons were cartoons.  urlLink Smurfs ,  urlLink Ghostbusters &nbsp;(it's not what you think),  urlLink Richie Rich ,  urlLink Kwicky Koala ,  urlLink Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour ,  urlLink Spiderman and His Amazing Friends , and other awesome stuff. Even with all these wonderful shows, Saturday morning wasn't Saturday morning without two major ingredients:  urlLink Cap'n Crunch  and Strawberry Quik.  &nbsp;  Cap'n Crunch, the staple of goodness for children all over the world. Nothing like the sugary sweet taste of a corn-based cereal. The good ol' Cap'n has stood the test of time and he still sails on the milky waters of cereal bowls everywhere.  &nbsp;  Strawberry Quik was something to forfeit a week's allowance for. I still remember the rectangular cylinder it came in with the round hole in the middle of the top. I was always careful not to drop any of the pinkish powder. I didn't want to waste this valuable resource. I can picture the pink bunny wearing overalls to this day. Unfortunately, the last time I looked for some at the store, I noticed that  urlLink Nestle  has decided that a pink bunny would be a bad idea and gave his job to the brown Quik bunny. I am appalled! I'm a white guy and I didn't mind that the strawberry bunny had some difference in his melanin. Or was it just a skin problem being remedied by medication that was turning his coat pink? (See the  urlLink polar bears )  &nbsp;  Enough being upset about the past. All I am saying is welcome to Friday. I hope you enjoy it, because Saturday morning just ain't the same.  &nbsp;   Strawberry Bunny , if you are reading this, you are greatly missed!&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       This is the beginning of a weekly Friday column entitled  The Deafening Silence . It will encompass quotes from&nbsp;a movie and/or lyrics from a song or music video for the week.     &nbsp;   The following is an excerpt from the movie   urlLink Cool Hand Luke :    [Luke won a game of poker on a bluff]    Dragline  :  Nothin'. A handful of nothin'. You stupid mullet head. He beat you with nothin'. Just like today when he kept comin' back at me - with nothin'.     Luke  :  Yeah, well, sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand.   &nbsp;   The following is an excerpt from the song    urlLink Cinematic    from the band   urlLink Cool Hand Luke  :   I want to live in such a way  That when I’m gone my friends would say  That if my life was turned to film  I’d be standing on a mountain shouting victory in the end  But in my heart I know it’s only true  If I’m supporting actor and the Oscar goes to You&nbsp;

      I'm sitting here looking at a bottle of  urlLink Elmer's School Glue , you know, the white kind that has a funky smell that kids like to eat! The odd thing about this specific bottle of glue is that I have no idea when it was purchased. I believe it was a bottle that I had when I was "knee high to a  urlLink June bug ". (By the way, that's redneck for "little").  As if an old bottle of glue wasn't bad enough, it gets worse. It's seems that somehow the glue has come apart. I'm not saying that it's lost it's stickiness. I'm saying that it seems to have separated into 3 types of liquid: white, opaque, and a light-brown watery solution. Well, I've said all of this because it totally reminds me of life.  The people that constantly contribute to your everyday meanderings make up the glue of life. I'm not saying that God isn't a major part of life, because I find Him to be the bottle that holds all of us in one place. So, His role in our lives is the one that keeps us from drying out or totally being separated. Thanks God! **(More on Him in another post)  Back to the "glue of life". Sometimes our lives get really crazy and we lose touch with the people around us. These people are often the closest people, you know, friends &amp; family. It's sad to see our bottles sitting there with dust on them and the different parts of the glue separated, but as I pick it up and shake it I realize that it isn't impossible to set the glue back the way it was. Sometimes all it takes is a little effort and the realization that we might be drifting apart. My advice: Call someone you haven't talked to in a while, write them an email. Let those that care for you know that you are still alive and that you care about them too. Hey, what's wrong with taking a break to stir things back up.  &nbsp;  Thanks God for being the bottle that holds everything together even when we try to separate ourselves!

      I went to lunch today with my friend Eric. What started out as the usual Mexican restaurant experience (chips & salsa) became the beginning of a pretty funny thing. You see, Eric, just like most people I know, recently graduated from college and is having a pretty hard time finding a decent job. There are jobs out there, but who really wants to work for 8 bucks an hour after spending years earning a degree. Yeah, just as I thought, I don't see any hands raised on that! While we were eating, he says to me, "I have an interview today at 3 o'clock." Since I am the impersonal kind of guy I am I just left it at that. Just kidding! I replied, "Where at?" "Waffle House," he said somewhat reluctantly. To make the story short, he informed me that his father's reply was "NO, NOOOOOOOOOOOO!" To me that was hilarious. I could just see his father doing such a thing. This is when the "Waffle House Inside Joke of the Day" was born! I will share it with you now.  Eric's Mom: "Eric's got a job interview tomorrow." Eric's Dad: "Really? Where at?" Eric: "The Waffle House." Eric's Dad: "No, nooooooooooooo."  The following lines are to replace the last line. 1. Eric's Dad: "Ya dead to me, son." 2. Eric's Dad: "No son of mine is gonna work at da Waffle House!" 3. Eric's Dad: "The seed from my loins, wasted!" 4. (Be creative and write your own reply.)  If you have a creative response, send them on through!

      *This is the final installment of the blockbuster "Tag Office Zombies" series.  Final Chapter:  There I am. Prepared. Wearing my "marathon shirt". Check in hand, ready to paper cut any undead hand that would shoot out to grab me. "Take a deep breath," I muttered to myself. I was hoping for a moment's worth of courage, but I received a far greater gift on this cursed morning. I opened the door to the government complex. My eyes widened and my heart stopped beating. The hallway was lined with the undead. There was no way this could be true. I thought that they only fed on the middle of the day and the late afternoon. Why? Why was this happening to me? In my moment of dispair and gloom, something was realized by my half-sleeping brain. The zombies were faced towards me and the line was entering the opposite side of the hallway! They had found fresh meat to feast on in the shape of....the DMV!!!  Seeing how they were being lured into the Temple of the Horseless Carriage, I made a mad dash to the Tag Office. Another blessing shined down from heaven. What I thought was the glory of the Lord was only the light of an empty line. Could I be #1? Could the undead have been lured away from this side of the complex?  "Sir, may I help you down here?" was spoken in a hushed voice. The absence of the groans and moans from the rotting corpses made it as loud as a  urlLink Darkness  concert! I handed the clerk all the paperwork and in less than two minutes, I returned to the silver automobile I like to affectionately call "Dad's car". Here I am, not missing any limbs or brain matter. My fingers can still type, but there's one thing I just realized. I'll have to return next year!!!!!!!!

      There is a song by the group  urlLink Self  called "Marathon Shirt". You can find it on their  urlLink Subliminal Plastic Motives  CD from around '95. (Good stuff by the way!)  In the song "Marathon Shirt", they are singing about a favorite shirt that they wear and are practically in love with. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let's begin our story. So, I wake up this morning to prepare myself with the battle of the undead once again. (For those who don't understand, see yesterdays posts) I look in the closet for a shirt and I see my newest item of affection: my  urlLink Further Seems Forever  shirt. You see my 3/4 sleeved baseball tee used to be the item of the year, but when I saw that maroon-colored beauty at  urlLink Hot Topic  I was smitten. I know what you are thinking "How can one be in love with a shirt?" Well, they can and I am! You can't tell me that there isn't an article of clothing that isn't your favorite. You know that pair of underpants that you refuse to relinquish to the garbage, or that old  urlLink Styx  shirt that was passed down from either your older brother (for some of us older kids) or from your hippy parents. Some of you might wonder what the point of this post is. It is quite simple. Take care of the ones you love, because one day they might not be around anymore.   R.I.P. my  urlLink Hong Kong Phooey  shirt. You are greatly missed!

      What a day! It hasn't been the craziest of crazy days, but it has been pretty interesting. It's funny how there are often many avenues that are before you and it's almost a fearful thing just trying to see exactly which one God would have you to go down.  What a crazy thought to have at the end of a night, but it reminds me of last Wednesday evening. A group of us gathered together for what was called "Community". I had come to believe that I would be heading to a Bible study of some kind, but it wasn't that at all. It was a place where Christians, from different backgrounds and areas of growth, came together to be one body. It ended up being very refreshing! You know, you never really realize what is going on in other people's lives. If they are anything like I am, I tend to only reveal a little bit and not the whole thing. Whoops! I got sidetracked! It was a great experience, the "Community" group that is. I entered the room only knowing a handful of people, but I left realizing that we are all one family. These are the people that I can call brother and sister. How amazing the body of Christ is! Certain circumstances hindered me from meeting on this second week of our "Community" group. I feel as if I have missed something that is spiritually good for me, kind of like a good granola bar and a bottle of water when you're halfway up a mountain trail! LOL Well, the night gets shorter and shorter and my eyes get heavier! Have a great night!

       Fight Club: The Board Game  was born a week ago during a late night run to the  urlLink Waffle House . What started as a discussion on board games such as  urlLink Axis & Allies ,  urlLink Monopoly , and  urlLink Twister ; became a "recipe" of sorts for a board game based on  urlLink Fight Club .   The following is how to make it yourself at home with very few items: 1 Twister board game 1  urlLink CPR  and  urlLink First Aid  trained person 1 Telephone 1 person to judge if the person or persons that have been beaten need serious help. This guy is also called the "911 guy".  Keep the left & right hand and the left & right foot parts of twister the same. The fun part begins here. Make a listing of body locations that will correspond with each color. This is pretty much all that is needed to be done. Oh, and about the Twister pad....fight on it!! LOL

      First there was the line to  urlLink Space Mountain  at the Magic Kingdom, then there was the line to renew or obtain a license at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Mountain has been taken and the king has been tossed down once again!!!  The Tag Renewal Office is officially the longest wait in history. The wait for  urlLink Fable  on the  urlLink Xbox  nor the wait until the Olsen Twins were of a legal age ( You sick freaks! ) were nothing but the passing of a minute on the clock of time compared to this place!  Enough of the dramatization. It's time for the plot of the story! So, I ventured into the Tag Office to renew my tags for the next year. Lo and behold the darkness overtook me and I was neck-high in a line of bodies (many looked like something out of  urlLink Night of the Living Dead )! I decided my best move was to survey the surroundings for some ray of hope.  There was no salvation in sight! The counter was close to barren, for only two lone clerks were waiting on the soul-sucking zombies in line. The putrid smell of the bodies began to fill my nostrils and nausea hit. I had to escape! Where would I find sanctuary? Only one way out...cause a ripple in the sea of the undead by going backwards through the line. There was no other way.  "Excuse me, sir" and "Excuse me, ma'm" were traded for grunts and moans of the beasts! The light wasn't too far off and freedom would soon be gained. I finally make it out and I had noticed, on my way through waves and waves of the foul creatures, that not a single eye ever followed my escape. This was another clue that truly these people were zombies and that nothing was going to stop them from their task at hand. However, just like every zombie movie, I'm going to have to return again. Maybe they will be feeding somewhere else in the early morning. I know that the next time, I'll be ready!

      I'm going through withdrawal and it's my own fault. You see it all started about four weeks ago when my father had a  urlLink kidney transplant . He and I decided that it would be wise if I started driving his Taurus instead of my F150. His reasoning was simple. He could easily get in and out of the car with fewer problems than he could my truck. So I agreed, reluctantly. What does this have to do with my recent symptoms? It seems that I had become so accustomed to my musical selection in my truck. You see, I am an avid fan of  urlLink Emery ,  urlLink Blindside ,  urlLink Further Seems Forever , and other great bands! I had also forgotten to remove these wonderful works of art from my disc changer. It's been four weeks. I haven't been able to crank up the volume and roll down my windows! I can't even remember the last time people looked at me funny for practically screaming along with my beloved tunes! I'm getting the shakes and I'm beginning to sing the lyrics in the shower to an imaginary crowd. All I am saying is this: Be careful what you listen to, you might just become an addict!

      Look outside at everyone. Take a long look at what you see. Go to the mall, go to school, even look on tv and you'll see it. What is "it"?  Definition:  it  - people of our society fail to be themselves. They are no longer separate entities of a collective unit. Everyone wants to be someone else and so everyone looks the same.  It drives me crazy to see how no one has their own opinion on anything. Television has totally brainwashed everyone. For instance, what MTV says is cool is what everyone else says is cool. Have you watched or listened to that "music in a can". It's all the same. Come on people let's be who we really are and stop going to the costume party called Cultural Life!

       The following is an excerpt from the movie   urlLink Ronin :     Sam  :    Excuse me, do you mind giving directions?    Man with the newspaper  :  Um, do you know me? Because if you don't know me, then how do you know that I speak English?    Sam  :  You're reading an English newspaper.    &nbsp;  The following is an excerpt from the song   urlLink Phoenix with a Heartache   by   urlLink Kids in the Way :   You rose from the ashes Like a phoenix with a heartache.  Now you're taking me away with you tonight and I know that I can't fly.  But when I'm in your arms, I'm holding up the sky.     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      I was thinking about a big  urlLink Hardee's  burger, that's  urlLink Carl's Jr . for you people on the western side of the United States! Thinking of said burger, a memory from the past hit me in the head like a beanball from  urlLink Roger Clemens ....hard and fast.  It was&nbsp;a Friday night, if I recall correctly. My friend and I wanted some Hardee's. So we drove up and ordered whatever meal we so desired, use your imagination if you wish. Before we rolled around to the window, he pulled out a small bottle of  urlLink Vick's Vap-O-Rub , opened it, taking a huge glob of it out with two of his fingers. He then smeared this  urlLink Vaseline -like substance onto his upper lip and over his nostrils. It was really thick! He made sure to snort a small breathing hole out of one of his nostrils. The smell of menthol overtook the green Ford Explorer that we were riding in. I could not breathe, not because of the pungent smell of the rub on his face, but because I was laughing so hard.   After being calmed down by my friend, we drove up to the window to give our money in exchange for our food purchases. This nice lady opened the window and my friend asked, "How are you doing?" in huge puffs. He wanted to make sure that the delicious smell of menthol filled the inside of the Hardee's drive-thru window.  He was successful! Her eyes grew when she saw the huge smear across the middle of his face. As she backed up to get his change and our food, she began to wave her hand quickly in order to fan away the smell!! His ploy worked!  She gave us an awkward smile as we kept our poker faces for just long enough to drive away. I tell you, memories like that never fade away, for I can still see the look on her face and the fanning of her hands as we drove away that night. The moral of the story is this...  If you can't think of anything funny to do tonight, try that! Plus it's a good gag to do on those nights you feel stopped up!

      Remember back in the 80's when every company was vying for the money of a pestered mother who's child, or children, wanted the newest cereal? If you answered "Yes", then maybe you will remember the crazy cereals that these companies put out then.      Donkey Kong Crunch  Donkey Kong Jr, Cereal   Donkey Kong (Yeah, there was 3 different Donkey Kong types)  Dino Pebbles  Dunkin' Donuts Cereal (I still remember the box that was separated into 2 halves. One for one flavor and one for the other. Kind of like a box of NERDS!)  ET Cereal  GI Joe Cereal (To find out more about GI Joe look in my archives  Ghostbusters Cereal  Gremlins Cereal  Ice Cream Cone Cereal (I SOOOOO remember these blessings from above!)  Mr T Cereal ( I pity the fool who don't eat my cereal!  See Pee Wee's Big Adventure.)  Nerds Cereal (Another 2 in 1 box)  Nintendo Cereal ( Nintendo, it's for breakfast now. Nintendo, it's a cereal wow !)  Pac Man Cereal  Rainbow Brite Cereal  Smurf Berry Crunch  Strawberry Shortcake Cereal  Superman Cereal  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cereal  Urkel-O's (Nothing like eating food while looking at that geeks face!)  WWF Wrestlemania VII Cereal   With this list, I've decided to think of some IPs (Intellectual Properties) that would make the WORST cereals ever.   Buffy the Vampire Slayer Cereal (Watch the milk turn to blood!)  Gigli Cereal (J-Lo and Affleck shaped marshmallows in every box!)  Soggy Bottom Boys Cereal (see   O Brother, Where Art Thou?  ; the cereal that stays soggy, right out of the box!)   &nbsp;

      To those who are reading this, I'm going to get straight to the point. Of course it's going to be after I give some background information!   I remember years and years ago when my sister and all her little friends were complete freaks about the  urlLink New Kids on the Block . They knew the words to every song that the band ever released, every dance step to the songs, and frame by frame recollection of every whack music video they produced. I believe I failed to mention the Saturday morning cartoon they had too!   I can remember a time when walking into her room was like being  urlLink Detective David Mills  stumbling into a room filled with odd pictures and other psychotic things. It was if a shrine of some sort were built to pay homage to Donnie, Danny, Joe, Jon, and Jordan!  (By the way, the only reason I remember all this crap is because somehow they slipped something in my    urlLink Mountain Berry Punch Kool-Aid   !)    Now you see what kind of lunacy that was going on all over the place! What is the point that I am driving at? What have we become? Are we too lazy to pine over some ridiculous band or person? I still remember the walls of my bedroom being lined with  urlLink Alyssa Milano  posters and pics that I stole from my sis's  urlLink Tiger Beat  and other teen picture magazines!  (I sure do miss Who's the Boss?)    I know what you are thinking. Who can we pine over? Well, I have decided to make a small list. If I have forgotten any, send them on through.     The New and Improved Michael Jackson  Carrot Top (this one needs no explanation)  Rosanne Barr  The lady who plays as Mimi on the Drew Carrey Show

      After racking my brain for a long amount of time, I finally came up with a job that I would enjoy doing. I also think that it has potential to make lots of money. It might even be so different that I could start a franchise. So without further ado, here's the idea...  Zombie Clowns for birthday parties, any celebratory gatherings, and for funerals!  I know, I know. Some of you are probably thinking   Why didn't I think of this? It's totally ingenious!   Well, here's a chance of a lifetime to make a serious difference in the lives of others around you. Leave me a comment on what you think. I'd love to get some feedback on this wonderful idea.  I am having a slight problem coming up with some names, so feel free to give me some ideas!

      If you read my last post, you know that I went to vote today. "Vote?" you might ask. Why yes, vote. Today was Primary day and I finally had the opportunity to take my voice to the world!  &nbsp;  My father and I headed over to our designated polling spot in our precinct. It's hilarious how you feel like you've stepped foot into a  urlLink PETA  march or something. Throngs of people march along the road holding all these signs supporting the candidate that has paid them to stand out in the hot sun. I was sure that I was going to see someone holding one saying " Will Wrestle For Food " on it.  &nbsp;  So, all these signs are stuck in the ground around the polling place like pikes after an ancient battle. I was expecting to see a few heads placed on top like there was some sort of reminder to those who dare enter this battleground for the November election! Some mysterious feeling came upon me. For I had become a warrior. I was here to destroy the hopes and dreams of  urlLink incumbents  and those vying for the jobs of the incumbents! "Face my wrath you heathen scum", I yelled as I held aloft my newly printed Voter's Registration Card.  &nbsp;  It was now time to storm the castle. Dad, or should I call him Footsoldier Pop, and I easily took the front gates. I believed that they were expecting an attack from another side, for there were no locks and there were no guards manning their posts. When we entered into the courtyard of the castle, we found...the voting booths!  &nbsp;  There is nothing to remind me of test taking like one of these machines! They give you a little card to slide into the machine and then tell you to choose an open one.  (Is it really necessary to give me that disclaimer? Am I going to share a voting booth with some guy or lady? Maybe next time I should ask if it is okay to push someone out of the way. Nothing like a little sarcasm in that quiet place. Sheesh, it's like a morgue in there!)  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Back to the story. So, I go to this little walled voting booth and begin to vote. I'm reading off names and thinking to myself, "Hmm. I don't remember what this guy stands for?" or "Was she for a tax increase?". I started feeling like I was taking a test in school. I wanted to look over my shoulder to my left or right to see if I have the right answer. I remember passing a note to the dude beside me that said   Pick the second choice on Chief Magistrate Judge.   Just kidding, but it did cross my mind. I wonder if they would have given me an F! HA!  &nbsp;  Well, after I finished, my dad and I made our way past  urlLink PETA  and  urlLink Greenpeace . I felt like a delegate to the United Nations who was being bombarded by all these special interest groups! Crazy stuff! We eventually made it back home in one piece. I did take away one fond memory of my first voting experience...  &nbsp;  Whenever you see the words "Write In", always put in your name. It's an easy way to get put on the news! Woot woot!

      Today I get to exercise. I'm not talking about  urlLink Sweatin' to the Oldies  or any of that  urlLink Tony Little  stuff. The exercise I am talking about is voting. I have never voted in my life. To be honest with you, I finally registered to vote earlier this year.  &nbsp; Some of you might be saying, why'd you wait so long to register. Well, I didn't wait. I actually registered years ago, but there was a mix up with the county. Since I was a little bit of a jerk back then, I thought I would just forget about it because "they don't want my vote". What an idiot I was! &nbsp; So today I'm going to go vote for Sheriff of my lovely county. Hmm. I wonder if I can put my name down and vote for myself? Interesting thought. Being Sheriff sounds pretty good!  &nbsp; Sheriff Kid_Lysol. Has a good ring to it, don't you think?

      If you really want to hear something different (and catchy after a few listens), then check these guys out. They are called  urlLink mewithoutYou . It's quite interesting. At first I was like, "okay, what the heck is this?" then I was like "the more I listen, the more I likes". I don't want you to go and listen and come back saying "what the heck was that stuff" or "master's tricksey". Give it a shot or better yet, inject yourself with some of the goodness!! Woot woot! &nbsp;   urlLink Gentlemen  - mewithoutYou   urlLink Bullet to Binary  - mewithoutYou

      So, if "knowing is half the battle", what's the other half?  &nbsp;  Every episode of  urlLink GI Joe  had these PSA's (Public Service Announcements) at the end. Different "Joes" would have some advice or thought that kids watching should know. { For a list of examples, click   urlLink  here  .} Since this blog is taken very seriously, I have decided to submit an aternate example of one of these so-called PSA's. I will make up a new GI Joe character and then give the scene. Feel free to send one in too! And as always "GO JOE"!  &nbsp;  Backbrace - a male "Joe" who helps move the other soldiers into their new barracks. Otherwise known in the civilian world as a "mover". He wears camoflaged pants and black boots. His shirt is black with "ARMY" printed in a golden color across it. He wears a noticable backbrace with flair on it. (Flair - the buttons that waiters and waitresses wear in food establishments such as  urlLink Applebee's ,  urlLink Ruby Tuesdays , etc. They are used as advertisement purposes.)  &nbsp;  Backbrace has just stumbled upon a couple of kids laughing and pointing at a little boy crying.  &nbsp;   Backbrace : What's going on here? Why are you kids laughing at the boy?   Girl #1 : He's just upset because he keeps losing.   Backbrace : Losing? Losing what?   Boy #1 : We're playing tag and he's too small and slow to catch any of us.   Backbrace : Is this true?  (directed towards the crying boy)    Crying Boy : Sniffle. Yes, sir. I'm just too small and too slow to play tag with the older kids.   Backbrace : Hmmm. Well, I have an idea! Stay right here, all of you.  &nbsp;  Backbrace leaves and returns with a heavy canvas bag.  &nbsp;   Not-Crying-Anymore Boy : What's in the bag, Backbrace?   Backbrace : It's the solution to your problem.  &nbsp;  Backbrace sets the bag down on the ground and pulls out a handful of rocks.  &nbsp;   Girl #2 : What's that for?   Backbrace : Well, since he can't catch the rest of you, I have come up with a new way to&nbsp;play&nbsp;tag. Everyone grab a handful of rocks. Okay, cryin' boy, count to ten and run after them.   Not-Crying-Anymore Boy : But they are too fast for me.   Backbrace : But can they outrun a rock? Nope. Now whoever gets pelted with a rock becomes the one who is it. There's always a way to include everyone and a better way to play.  Not-Crying-Anymore Boy : And now I know!  Backbrace : And knowing is half the battle!&nbsp; &nbsp;  GI JOE&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  (Disclaimer: The&nbsp;script above does not coincide with the views of the blogger or&nbsp;blogger.com. All&nbsp;characters and&nbsp;actions are merely&nbsp;coincidental.

      In one hand was a bottle of Holy Water, aka  urlLink OFF with Deet . In the other hand, I held my flaming torch, aka&nbsp;a  urlLink Citronella candle  already lit. The sun had gone down and the blood-sucking  urlLink demons  would soon come out to play.  &nbsp;  I doused my body heavily with the holy water, hoping that it's essence would hinder them from sinking their fangs into me. Swinging my torch from left to right, I quickly made my way to the other side of the porch. All seemed well. Then my left ear heard the screeching sound!  &nbsp;  One had caught me off guard. I could hear it coming up from behind me.&nbsp;Making a quick dash to the left, I spun around to find five of the&nbsp;unholy spawns. I was surrounded like a stray fry in an order of onion rings! What was I to do?  &nbsp;  Flailing my hands to no avail, I made a quick dash towards sanctuary.&nbsp;I knew that they could not follow inside such a holy place. This attempt at a retreat would not be so easily done. For they had mounted an attack outside the screened doors! I ran and dived towards the doorway. Their twisted bodies fled as the smoke billowed from the Citronella torch. I shut the door, locking it. Tonight was a night of victory, for all seemed well. I looked down and noticed.  &nbsp;  I had been bitten.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Alright, it's Saturday and that means that there's no school. I know, I know. You're about to tell me that it's summer time and there's no school in the summer. Well, last night I drove by a local high school and what did I find? Open House!  I can't believe that time has come once again for all the children in America to pack up their bookbags with their hotpink colored folders and Trapper Keepers. (Wait, that's my generation! Gen-X!) I wonder if the elementary kids even have those boxes that they keep scissors, glue, and other kindergarten-only stuff. Hmm.  Gosh I'm old. I've said all this to make one loud cry...  Have fun in school! Some say they are the best years of your life! (I hope this is truely a false statement!)

       The following is an excerpt from the movie   urlLink The Secret of My Succe$s  :    Brantley Foster aka Carlton Whitfield  : Okay, so you don't eat lunch. Do you eat dinner?   Christy Wills  : Occasionally.   Brantley Foster aka Carlton Whitfield  : Tonight?   Christy Wills  : Booked.    Brantley Foster aka Carlton Whitfield  : Tomorrow night?    Christy Wills  : Booked.    Brantley Foster aka Carlton Whitfield  : All right, but don't beg, okay? It's embarassing.   The following is an excerpt from the song   urlLink Emotion   by the band   urlLink subseven  :  do I just let go - turn my head say “no”? -  should I go with the flow - try to take control (control)? -  would it be alright if I tried to deny - the Ghost of my life -  I don’t feel so right (not so right).    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Everyone should know what deja vu is. For those of you who don't here's a good definition. ( urlLink clickity click here !)  I have decided that I have experienced deja vu recently. I've been a little worried about it too. You see ever since dad came home from the hospital, I've been here. Well, we watch a lot of movies on television (that's t.v. for those born after 1990).&nbsp;It seems that  urlLink AMC &nbsp;provides quite&nbsp;a few movies to watch.   The past few weeks I could have sworn that I am either experiencing deja vu or that I am living in some kind of  urlLink Groundhog Day  scenario. My reasonings for believing such a thing is simple. I have seen  urlLink Rocky V  everyday. I'm getting nervous and scared about this. I keep trying to do things differently to see if it changes anything. Last night I put on a mudmask to see if there would be any new reactions to me when I woke up. Nada, nothing.   I'm trying to think of some other ideas that would help me change the course of this continual Rocky V showing. I feel like I'm the guy off of&nbsp; urlLink Clockwork Orange  and that they are trying to  urlLink brainwash  me. If you have any ideas of things I should try.... holla!

      Who am I? Well, that all depends on my DM (Dungeon Master for those who are RPG illiterate!). ( urlLink Click here naive half-lings !) You see, there is nothing like playing in a made up universe with a character that you have molded yourself. Of course, there are some limitations, but there is always room to improve the character that you have made.   Last night I was able to create a character that I really believe I am going to have a lot of fun with. It is a tiefling. What is that? Well, it is a decendant from the underworld. You are probably thinking  Oh no, demons!  Rest assured that there is no demon worship in our campaigns. A campaign is the gaming world we are role-playing in. I am excited about the up-and-coming&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;and some people may call me nerdy, but who stinkin' cares!   What is a role-playing game? To answer that question in a simple manner, it is like a movie in which you can be involved in. You make the choices. You aren't just a character that is prewritten. You are part of an ever evolving script. For those of you who wonder how much fun this is, all I can say is try it. Vin Diesel is an avid Dungeons &amp; Dragons player. He plays as a half-drow witchhunter! ( urlLink Click here ye unbelievers !) I know, more lingo that you don't get. Check it out by looking it up on  urlLink Google . I guarantee nights of fun and enjoyment. It's even helpful in your acting skills!!

      Comics. Movies bound in a paperback form. Not only was there a storyline, but there was also detailed pictures to go along with it. I still remember the first comic book I ever purchased. It was the  urlLink Uncanny X-Men Annual #10 . I was just a little kid and my mother said that she would let me pick something out at the drugstore if I made a 100 on my spelling test. Needless to say, this began an addiction that still causes a relapse even today.    I love comic books. It made me want to learn how to draw. It also provided me with some really wonderful friends who shared a like interest. There was even a time where my friends and I had our own separate universes that we would sometimes have crossovers with.    Ah, those awesome characters. They had cool background stories and the ideas for their costumes were so imaginative. I tell ya, those days will never be forgotten. I would name off a few of the characters that my friends and I created, but we might want to use them one day and I ain't going to jeopardize that in any way!!     I still collect comics every now and then when I have the extra funds. I tell ya, things have surely changed since that day in 1986. I still miss the old school style of comics, but some of the newer stuff really rocks!!     Beloved friend, you have given me years of fun and enjoyment. Mortal enemy, you have made me a pauper!

      Go back a couple of decades and you will find that singers went by their own names. Those who didn't, still made up names that sounded like real names.  urlLink Nat King Cole  was Nat King Cole.  urlLink Elvis Presley  was Elvis Presley.   Today is a totally different animal. Sean Combs calls himself Puff Daddy or P Diddy. Robert Van Winkle called himself Vanilla Ice. So many musical artists have all these names. Ice T, Ice Cube, Easy E, Sheena E, and other names are rampant in todays musical scene.   I have decided to come up with a few names for those who haven't decided to change their given monikers.     urlLink John Mayer  aka Mother Mayer I   urlLink Clay Aiken  aka Caken   urlLink Britney Spears  aka B.S. Elite   I know that you're probably thinking that these names aren't funny. Well, this is serious and it needs to be taken as such. So with all serious posts, send me something back, flippies!

      My dad, whom I like to call Pop, whom likes to say "Call my Pop again and I'll pop you!", had a doctor's appointment today. As with all doctor's appointments I have been to, I am so thrilled to sit in a waiting room full of sick people.   I enjoyed inhaling the deep phlegmy coughs of the man sitting next to me and being sneezed on by that little boy with the runny nose and nausea. (Actually this isn't a true sentence for today, but it was in a past visit!! Roop, roop!)   So, we get to the office and we sit down in these seats that make this sound of flatulence everytime you move. I was a little embarassed at first until I noticed that everyone else had the same problem. (Darn you  urlLink Taco Bell !! Just kidding.) So here we are, still sitting there after what seems like a lifetime. I felt like  urlLink Han Solo in the Carbon Freeze . I was frozen in the moment and there was no way to get out! Argh!   Finally after an hour and a half, they call us to the back. I was relieved. This moment of relief was fleeting. We waited again for another hour and a half until someone came to see us. The good thing is that someone did remember us. The bad thing is that it wasn't the doctor.   Figuring that it would be a while, I took it upon myself to learn medicine. I grabbed a pair of latex gloves from the box that sat on the table beside me and I began to roam from room to room checking vital signs and a couple of prostates. Scratch that, I did nothing of the sort. I just closed my eyes and relaxed for a while longer.   After time passed as slowly as  urlLink Eeyore  talks, the doctor emerged into the room like a newborn into the world. Yes, I was just as excited as a father would be! Then I was let down. I felt like I did when I found out that  urlLink Diff'rent Strokes  was being cancelled! My reasoning was simple: "Mr. Lysol, everything looks fine. We'll see you in two weeks!"   Speaking of a quick visit for a long wait! The moral of the story is this: if you notice that a pack of dogs have a cat cornered, grab the B.B. Gun and put the cat out of its misery. Woot!

      Complaining. Yes, this is one of those posts where you either enjoy my ranting or you don't. The topic of my complaint is how I am disappointed in things of today that were once great yesteryear. Since some attention spans are limited, I will be reviewing only 3 things today.   Item #1:   urlLink Cracker Jack   (That delicious caramel coated popcorn and peanut mix was once an anticipated thing for little children. They were once something to desire more than they are now. Why? Because they used to have decent little prizes in them. Granted it was just a little plastic monkey or a coin holder in the shape of a horse. Today it's random jokes and lick-the-food coloring-on-the-paper-and-stick-it-to-your-arm tattoos. Boo hiss boo.)   Item #2:  Saturday Morning Cartoons  (see post  Saturday Morning Goodness [Fri, July 16, 2004].  To sum it all up; there's nothing worth watching anymore!)   Item #3:   urlLink GI Joe&nbsp;figures   (You might be saying to yourself  Didn't he have a post about GI Joe a while back?  Well, the answer is yes, but it was about the Public Service Announcements and it wasn't a rant! So poo on you! Back to the topic at hand, it seems that GI Joe figurines are no longer made the way they used to be. They just don't look as sturdy. Why oh why? Gone are the days that the Crimson Twins (Tomax and Xamot) looked pretty menacing. I still remember the scars. Oh where has that the Barbecue that I love gone?&nbsp;He once looked cool.&nbsp;( urlLink Verson 1 ) Then semi-okay.&nbsp;( urlLink Verson 2 ) Then they just decided to make him look ridiculous. ( urlLink Verson 3 ) Tisk, tisk, tisk.)

      I'm a little lost here. Hmmm. It seems that neither a pie in the face nor witty banter between a few characters brings about laughter, violence does.  I went with a couple of friends of mine to see The Village (I enjoyed it by the way) last night. I'm not going to get into the movie, but I will say that there was a somewhat violent scene in it. The violence isn't what disturbed me the most, it was the laughter of the audience that followed.  Now I'm beginning to wonder if people watch the news hoping for some comic relief in the form of suffering of others, murder, and other atrocities. What I'm saying is, what kind of world do we live in these days?

       This week, I'm doing a Goonies theme for Vol 1.4 of The Deafening Silence. If you've never seen the movie Goonies, you are an alien.      The following is an excerpt from the movie   urlLink The Goonies  :    Mikey  : Don't you realize? The next time you see sky, it'll be over another town. The next time you take a test, it'll be in some other school. Our parents, they want the best of stuff for us. But right now, they got to do what's right for them. Because it's their time. Their time! Up there! Down here, it's our time. It's our time down here. That's all over the second we ride up Troy's bucket.   The following is an excerpt from the song   urlLink The Goonies 'R Good Enough   by   urlLink Cyndi Lauper  :  Old fashioned superstitions I find too hard to break Oh maybe you're out of place  What's good enough for you Is good enough for me It's good enough It's good enough for me Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

      Does anyone remember...    Playing with the cardboard tube after all the Christmas wrapping was removed from it? It sure made a nice sword...well, until you actually hit something with it.  Riding your bike all day long and never getting tired? There was nothing like some road rash to toughen up kids back in the day. I was forever getting my knees and hands bloodied up!  Pulling out all the pots and pans and playing them like drums? That doesn't happen today. Kids now have these technologically savvy toys. Shame it is.  Waking up early in the summer to play outside? It was 7am and I was ready to play until the sun went down. Today, everyone stays inside to play PS2 or Xbox.   What do you remember?

      Golf. A sport in which you hold sole responsibility for either doing good or bad. You cannot blame a fellow teammate for having a poor day. You cannot say that the coach did not do his/her job when it came down to preparing you. Your score relies totally on your skill or lack thereof.  I really enjoy watching golf. This has happened in recent years. I remember when turning on the t.v. on Saturday afternoons was a literal hell-on-earth to me. I despised seeing men, dressed up like they were going to a Sunday evening church service, hitting a small ball in hopes that it will make it into a hole. Now if that doesn't sound boring, I have no idea what would.  I prefer to play golf than watch it. Your first question to me might be  Are you any good?  Easy answer: Nope! That all matters to me and that is why I enjoy playing. I love seeing a change in my score. I love seeing my horrible swing evolve into a better swing. I just enjoy the challenge it gives me.  What does this have to do with a 3-iron? Simple. The last time I played, I broke the shaft of my 3-iron by wrapping it around a small pine tree. You might think that was a stupid thing to do, but you see I was trying to learn how to do a punch shot. Was I upset when I did this? Naw. I realized that it is like any lesson in life. You learn from the mistakes you make, even when you are trying to do the best thing at the moment. In other words, don't panic over your "3-iron". There's more golf to be played and more room to become a better player in the game of life.

      So we were able to finally get the crossover that we have all been hoping for;  urlLink Freddy vs Jason . Yeah, I know. Some of you don't really care for horror movies, but this was the biggest deal since  urlLink Babe Ruth  was traded to the  urlLink Yankees  from the  urlLink Red Sox !  After seeing said movie, it dawned on me that you really can't do too many crossovers in the movies these days. For instance, you would never see a  urlLink Star Trek / urlLink Star Wars  crossover. Why? Because it just would not work. Do you really think that the members of the Star Fleet would be able to hold off even one Jedi? Hmmm.  On to what is typically referred to as "chick flicks". You see, there would be no possible way to cross these over. I'll be honest, I enjoy watching them. The only problem is that there is no way to extend the story, unless you are watching  urlLink Father of the Bride . They found a way to do something with it. I just couldn't see a "happily ever after" type of movie have a crossover with another of the same genre. Wouldn't work!  This summer we are getting a taste of an action/horror film crossover:  urlLink Alien vs Predator . From the looks of the trailer, I really hope this movie isn't just a pretty name wrapped in garbage. It is something that has been in the works for a while and something that all Alien fans, and even Predator fans, have been looking forward to. I say good luck!  Here's a small list of movies that I believe we will never see crossover (and titles to boot!):    urlLink The Sixth Sense / urlLink Ghostbusters : I Ain't Afraid of No Ghost   urlLink Steel Magnolias / urlLink Patch Adams    urlLink Platoon / urlLink Braveheart : Bullets vs Brawn   urlLink Willow / urlLink Harry Potter : Muggles and Madmartigans!

       I have decided that on Monday, I will have an editorial of sorts. My topics will be broad and range from one end of the spectrum to the other. Enjoy and feel free to respond.      Topic   :  Jobs & Money   I have been giving thought to something that we all long for; jobs that pay well. You see if I recall correctly, some jobs are looked down upon while others are praised in most sectors of America and even the world.  I am realizing, as I get older, that whatever profession that you have chosen to do is not anything to be ashamed about. You see, we live in a country where we have many freedoms. One of those freedoms is that we have the choice to choose where we go to college (depending on SATs and GPAs), what girl we marry (or guy for you women), and what job we want to pursue.  It has dawned on me that there is no bricked-up dead ended alleyway in our lives. We all have options. The problem does not lie in the lack of opportunities, but in the self-discipline and desire to take those opportunities as far as we can imagine.  R.I.P. Clemson, for you were just one road in the map called life!! I wonder which direction I'll go next! Woot!

      Well, well, well. What do we have here? It looks like a Saturday posting on America's #1 source for news: The Silent Parade. Oh wait, that's not right. There's not too much news worthy stuff here at the moment, or for that matter of fact, not anywhere in the near future as far as I can see.  Today I have decided to test my skills as a search engineer and see if there are some outlandish tricks that people have taught dogs. You're probably thinking that I am running out of material to blog about. Well, you are right. NOT! I happened to see a funny picture the other day and now I want to see if it was real, so hold on to your leashes and prepare yourselves for the  urlLink time of your lives .     urlLink Teaching a dog to check another dogs throat   (this is actually pretty interesting to see how animals can be taught things in the veternary sciences)   urlLink Very interesting how rodeos are progressing   (you must see this for yourself)   I would show more, but I think you should get off your lazy booties and look for yourself.

       A few posts ago, I dived straight into the world of beer to find out where they received their names. Well, I went to the   urlLink Warsteiner   website and to no avail, found nada (that's nothing in Spanish for you Espanol illiterate!). I then decided that I would email them and see if I would receive a reply. Days past and still nada. Well, today there was a reply and here it is with the orginal letter. Enjoy!      My question is simple, where did the name Warsteiner come from?       Thanks,       Kid Lysol                     Dear Kid Lysol,              Thank you for your interest and support of Warsteiner.              Warsteiner was first brewed by the Cramer family in Warstein, Germany - which is where the name Warsteiner came from.              The funny part is how it came about. The Cramer family were actually farmers and they brewed their beer just for personal consumption. Then they actually brewed too much so the government taxed them on it. Therefore; they began to sell it to help pay the taxes and word spread quickly about this excellent new beer.              Had the government never taxed the Cramer's, Warsteiner beer may not even be around today.              Thanks again for your interest and support.              Mike Mefford       Warsteiner Importers Agency       Cincinnati, OH

       The following is an excerpt from the movie   urlLink Back to the Future  :   Dr. Emmett Brown : Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely eighty-eight miles per hour the instant the lightning strikes the tower... everything will be fine.   The following is an excerpt from the song   urlLink This is Who You Are   by   urlLink The Beautiful Mistake  :  Words will try, to break us down Cloud our minds, with waves of regret Storms will come, but in the end We will win!

      I'm sitting here looking for odd sports on the internet and I'm having a hard time finding any. I know they are out there, but the problem lies in finding the correct word to put into the search engine.  Okay, so I found a site that has odd sports, but they aren't really all that odd. They include mountain unicycling, elephant polo, curling, underwater hockey, and cup stacking. If you are like me, I don't find these that odd. I'm amazed that someone else would.  Since those aren't all that weird, I have a few linky-poos for you to go to.    urlLink Dolphin races  (really cool looking sport, I think I'd have to have an oxygen tank though)   urlLink Prison high jump  (I'm intereseted to see if the winner gets out of jail free)   urlLink Para-skeet-chute  (I've said enough already)   urlLink Militant tennis  (I'm surprised that this one isn't popular in Iraq. I thought it would be)   urlLink Extreme basketball  (If you think you are hardcore, think again!)   Well, I know that you know that I know that I'm going to ask you to come up with some crazy sports of your own...so send them in!!!

      It will soon be fall. Right now, all I can think about is football. You know, when the air starts cooling down and the sky has that not-so-sunny look anymore, that fall is here. My fondest memories of the fall go way back. I remember going outside in the neighborhood to play football with all the other kids. Of course, this means that homework was already done or either we've told a little fib only to do it the next morning at school in homeroom!  Those were the days! I remember going to see the Georgia Bulldogs play. We'd stop by this little shack on the side of the road to buy boiled peanuts on the way home from the game. Ah, football! Those crisp days in Athens were memories never forgotten. How I would love to relive some of those Saturday afternoons.  Then there's Sunday and Monday nights. Football, football, football. I remember watching John Elway drive down the field with the Denver Broncos offense. He stole Cleveland's chance of going to the Super Bowl. Needless to say, it was quite a few years before he finally won a Super Bowl, but I stayed a fan in all the years that he lost them!  All of these little stories and memories remind me of why the fall is my favorite season of the year. Nothing like thin long-sleeved shirts and blue jeans, not to mention all the cool looking clothes come out in the fall. I'm counting down the days until summer officially ends!

      Watching t.v. and all the hooplah that has been surrounding the race for the presidency, I sometimes have this crazy notion in my head. Before I tell you what that notion is, I have a question for you. Have you ever had an idea that might seem silly at the time, but in all reality, it's not so crazy after all?  If you answered "yes" to that question, then you'll understand what I'm talking about. You see, I had the notion that "when I turn 35, why couldn't I run for the presidency? When is the last time that we actually saw someone that young run?". The answer to all these crazy questions are simple.  The only thing stopping anyone from running is probably money. I know what you are thinking. You probably think that I've lost my mind. In all honesty, these are hypothetical questions. I like to have those every now and again. Kind of like "I wonder if I could be an astronaut?". I think the road to running for president (not being the president) would be a little easier. Granted I'd probably end up like Nader. You know, having only a margin of votes that wouldn't even amount to anything. HA!!  About being 35, I think the youngest person to run for the presidency was JFK. I believe he was in his 40's. Maybe a young guy or girl would shake things up a bit. Here's a question for you: Why is there only two major parties in America? Why do people only embrace those? By the way, the Green Party doesn't count and neither does the Christian Coalition.  Have you ever thought about being in politics? Have you ever wanted to be the President of the United States? Answer me!!!!!  Growl.  :)

      Today, I would like to take a look at some of the beer labels that we see in the supermarket and some that are somewhat obscure. Most names are derived from the company itself, but others, well, you'll see.     urlLink Pabst Blue Ribbon   Miller Lite (this is a given. Name comes from the Miller Brewing Co.)   urlLink Budweiser    urlLink St. Pauli Girl   Warsteiner (hopefully, I'll have a surprise to post about this soon!)   Well, I have just posted a few names of beers. I might actually make this into an interesting weekly thing where I find out where names of other things come from, but until then I have a request: If you were to brew your own beer, what would you name it?

       The following are snippets from true stories that I have experienced in my life....psychological discretion is advised.     I knew a guy who had his car painted the same as Starsky and Hutch. The car was a 90's model Lincoln Towncar. And by the way, he had his CD player removed and had an 8-track installed.  I once had to weight a lady that was over 500lbs to see if she met the requirements to ride the city buses.  I worked at a drive-thru teller window at a bank once. Two guys drove through with ski masks on and never stopped. Very odd behavior. Plus, it will get you a few years in prison too!  I asked an old man for his ID when I worked in the drive-thru bank. He started cussing me, got out of his car, and came knocking on the bulletproof glass. He then asked, in a very non-polite way, if I would accompany him in a good ol' fashioned sassy whoopin'.

         Topic   : Politics and Famous People  I swore to myself that I was not going to get involved in politics when I started this blog. I will give a little disclaimer first. I am not going to take any sides with this posting, but I will voice my opinion on something that I find really ignorant. Turn the page when you hear the chimes ring like this "brrrrrrinnnngnggngng". Let's begin our story.  So it looks like musicians and actors are going to use their well-known personas to try to sway voters one way or the other. Now this is a complete slap in the face to Americans. Let's dissect this a little bit, shall we!   Duh, I don't have a mind of my own. I will do whatever Artist X says for me to do. I will vote the way Band #2 says to vote.  How ridiculous does that sound? Well, obviously it doesn't sound ridiculous to quite a few people. Do Americans not have a mind of their own anymore? In a previous post weeks ago (see  All Together Separate  on 07/14/04) I discussed my opinion on the fact that people no longer think for themselves. This is now the MTV generation. MTV dictates what they say, do, and think. This is pretty scary to me.  It's not just MTV that has people like this. It's biased media that helps to skew the view of people. If you don't agree with someone's opinion, to heck with ya. That's the way they are making it out to be. It truly is a shame. We have become the generation of constant technological achieving. Unfortunately, we've forgotten how to use the brains that brought us here.  Find out the truth about things before you follow the others. Sometimes the sheep wander off and get eaten by the wolves. Woot!

      AVP. Aliens vs Predator if you are wondering what AVP is.  Well, I saw it tonight and I would have to say that there's more plot in a Harlequin novel. It was so bad that I just can't see commenting anymore about it.  Whoever wins, we lose.  You're right, I just lost 8 bucks!

      After what seems like an eternity, Halivar finally posted for the first time in ages. I know that he probably did this to appease me. HA! Well, with his Last Dragon comment he has awoken the beast that has laid dormant in my soul. I will call that beast the first Jean Claude Van Damm movie I can recall. He was actually the bad guy in the movie. What was that movie you ask?  NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER  I have yet to see where this movie can be purchase in DVD form. I seriously doubt if they will ever put it into that format. I know it wasn't the most popular movie in the world, but there's nothing like seeing some dude being trained by Bruce Lee's ghost (actually, if you haven't guessed it wasn't Bruce Lee at all). Well, if you know what I am talking about, holla back!!

      "Looks like I've lost the toner to the printer. Can you help me find it?", says mom.  "Sure thing.", I say as I think to myself that this won't take long at all. Boy am I wrong. I've been through four rooms looking for a small bag that contains a brand, spanking new printer cartridge.  Now, I know, I know. Why isn't it near the printer? Well, I have no idea because I'm not the one who lost it. HA! So, I looked everywhere and then I decided to use some private dick skills. I sat in the chair my mom uses in the computer room and thought,  If she placed it on the desk and it fell, where would it be?  Well, I looked under her desk and low and behold, there it was hidden from the naked eye. Time ticks away it seems and all I have to show for it is a $21.00 printer cartridge. At least I didn't have to pay for it! Snoof, snoof!

       urlLink It's Fishstick Friday . Well, if it really is Fishstick Friday, someone forgot to tell Halivar to cook some fishsticks. It seems he's gone on hiatus and there's no one manning the fishfry. Now, if you are reading this Halivar, know that I have done this for your own good. Consider it a blogging accountability session. 'Bout time you updated my friend, 'cause I know there's some crazy stuff that goes on day after day in your life. So, I'm calling you out, Hulkster. Whoops! I meant, Halivar. Oh yeah, and have a great day!!

       Welcome back to another addition of My Side of Monday. As you may or may not know, this is my only editorial for the week, so enjoy!      Topic   : The Music Industry  Some of you may disagree with me. If you do, you are free to make whatever comments you want. I'm here to express my opinion with the state of the music industry today. It seems that radio is either being bombarded with the likes of Hip Hop/R&B stations or Top 40 stations which for the most part are Hip Hop/R&amp;B. Now some of you may think that I'm going to sit here and bash the genre known as Hip Hop. Well, if you think that, you are probably correct.  You see, it seems that there was a time when Hip Hop was more than just "look at my girly's bootie", "let me screw your body and then move on to another girl", "smoke the weed", or any of the things that show that people no longer respect other people, but are just out to do whatever the heck they please. Look at Run DMC and the Beastie Boys. They were right in the middle of the Hip Hop movement when it started flourishing. I'm not saying that they created Hip Hop, because we all know that happened years earlier. What I am saying is that they had and still have more to rap about than the things I previously mentioned.  Hip Hop is stagnant. The beats have become so repetitious that I can see why there are a majority of rappers out there. It obviously isn't taking too much talent to come up with a decent sound. To prove that point, I actually came up with the stupidest lyrics in the world on top of a beat. Needless to say, someone told me that it was "tight". HA!  Okay, okay, okay. So, not all rap artists are copycats of sound and lyrics, but a majority are. Maybe that's why I love the music of the 70's and 80's so much. There were some decent bands in the 90's too. Who can say that  urlLink Led Zeppelin  copied anyone? What about Heart? Granted some people hate the stuff they did in the 80's, but it was still good! I think that is why the music of those years have stood the test of time. It's all different. You could tell by the music who someone was. The voice told you, the lyrics even told you.  I love emo. It's todays punk in my opinion. It's very emotional. The lyrics are extremely poetic and the rhythms change like the weather outside. It's great stuff. If you want to hear some, just look over to the right of this post and see what songs I have listed. There's websites to click on to. Back to what I was saying. I'm disgusted with the radio. I listen to mostly CDs. I would say that it's probably 99% of the time. Philaces at  urlLink The Black Hole  has introduced me to  urlLink XM . When I finally get a job, I think I'm going to invest in one of those wonderful toys! At least I know they have good music playing and they aren't catering to the MTV kids of the world. By the way, the music sucks on that station 99% of the time. Booyah!

      So, here I am. Another Sunday has flown by quicker than a freshman's first Spring Break in  urlLink Cancun . I tell you, this has been a very unproductive Sunday if I have ever seen one in my life. Last night I was having a major problem sleeping. It seems this is a reoccuring thing, night after night. Back to last night, I popped in a  urlLink Learn Japanese In Your Car  CD into my  urlLink XBox  around 3am. I had to try something, so I laid back in my bed and let that play. I think I have stumbled upon the insomniac's best friend. Not only did I finally fall asleep, but I think I've learned a few words also. So, Arigato Gozaimasu, to the lady who does the translations in the CD!  Well, the day, as I stated earlier has been very unproductive. I did catch a little bit of the  urlLink 2004 Olympic Games  on NBC. I was commenting on how those gymnasts can do all of those things. It's pretty amazing. The swimming wasn't too bad either. It did dawn on me that I really didn't enjoy watching them too much. I'm just patiently waiting on football to start up. When that happens, then there will be something to watch. By the way, the  urlLink Georgia Bulldogs  are ranked #4 and #3 in the Coaches' Poll and the AP Poll! Go Dawgs, sic 'em! Woof, woof, woof!!!
