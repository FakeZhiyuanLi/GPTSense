						    Work:  Margot's back.  Please.  Comments:  Margot's back!  We did our usual thing yesterday--lunch @ Makeda, going to the bank, running other errands, and basically catching up on things.  I graded like a madwoman last night, and a lot of the papers were very good.  I prepared for class, went out for a very late dinner with Margot, and then we hung around a bit more until she grew tired.  Not much was done, and I didn't write a thing (not to mention the fact that I didn't exercise).  I also spent a bit more money than I would have liked, but I don't think it will be the end of the world.  I did not hear from the insurance company today.  I watched part of a horrible Red Sox game, and mapped out my academic schedule until Thanksgiving--what a nightmare that will be!  If I can do it though...wow.

						   Another day, another weird sleeping schedule...I wish I could stay on track.  Falling asleep wasn't working for me, so I cleaned up the room, prepared my grocery list, and browsed some of my favorite Ethiopian and Indian recipes.  I'll do a cost estimate next time I go shopping--who knows, maybe I'll be able to make myself Atakilt Wat for dinner instead of paying $$$$ at Makeda.  When business hours rolled around (and I still hadn't slept), I called the insurance company to see if I could clarify things.  As with every person at every horse insurance company I've ever dealt with, the woman was rude, cold and made me feel like I was wasting her time (and here I am just trying to be honest with them).  I faxed some stuff directly to an underwriter (and I actually operated the damn fax machine properly for once), so  hopefully  I will hear back from her tomorrow.  I slept for a few hours (four or five...which used to be all the sleep I needed in a night...I hate 23).  I feel like I'm being picked to death by little things...I need to see this person, email that person, check this date, blah, blah, blah.  Erg.  I've been sitting here in my "office," waiting for students who "desperately" needed to see me, and never showed up--I could have spent this time napping!  However, I was able to make it through the book reviews in this month's journal, which makes me feel like I accomplished something academic, which is nice.  I stalled on Margot's gift; I hope to finish it by tomorrow.  At least class this week will not require a lot of thought from me--but I do need to finish all the grading (and by finish, I mean start) in time for class on Wednesday.  I feel constantly rushed because I am dimly aware that July, a month that usually drags, and that I hate, will go by very quickly this year.  At least I get random, unexpected Red Sox tomorrow...of course, with my luck, they'll lose.

						    Work:  Pages read: 0 Pages written (fic): 1 Pages written (non-fic): 0  Comments:  I really need to institute a "page a day" rule for my dissertation like I have for my fiction work--that would just make sense, wouldn't it?  Today didn't go at all as I imagined it would, and though tomorrow will suck because of that, I'm not too ruffled about it right now.  Just as I was about to go to bed, my mother signed onto IM, and we had a nice chat--she sounded much more upbeat than she did in her email.  I keep on forgetting how much we're alike.  I was v. v. v. proud of myself, as I passed up a Coke and snack, and tried to go to sleep.  The problem was, I failed.  Since the weather was nice this morning, I took my walk at 5:30am.  It was  glorious ; I did stairs and all sorts of stuff, and didn't feel like I was going to fall over and die.  I finished exercising and decided I would sleep a few hours before going to Mass.  Let's just say that did not work out for me, as I woke up around 5pm.  There was a memo from Housing telling us to be out by July 30th (funny, I swear my contract was until the end of July; I should demand a refund just to be a bitch about it).  This means that my visit with Jessica and Kyle is going to be extremely weird.  Had a nice long chat with Sean that has been a few days in the making, so that was good.  I'm ready to kill a few of my students--if you haven't done any of the work for the final, and you're in a group, why not ask your group members for help instead of whining to me (especially after I said, "If X, then email me by FRIDAY") and demonstrating that you've put the project off until the last minute?  Oh well...they're not going to be happy with me tomorrow at all, as I don't have their papers graded.  Nichole's students are driving her insane too, so I guess it's just that time of the term.  I'm trying to make headway on Margot's birthday gift, and what I have so far looks beautiful, but she needs to give me a few more bits of info before I can finish it.  It's a great idea though, and I'm pretty sure she'll like it.  I will have to run errands and deal with the issue of insurance tomorrow, which will be wretched, I am sure.  I also need to clean the room before class, though hopefully I can manage some of that tonight.

						   My second-favorite grouch/contrarian (the first, of course, being my Dad) turns 24 today.    There must be something about these end days of June, because two of my absolute favorite people ended up being born on consecutive days.  Clay was the first person who was ever nice to me without having a discernible motive for being nice to me (i.e., he didn't need my help with schoolwork, we weren't a part of the same "outcast" group, I wasn't the friend of a friend--he had nothing to gain, in other words)--that's not to say that I don't have  great , enduring friendships with people who had a "reason" to be nice to me, but I remain touched by his extension of random kindness.  I enjoy his company, because as he once said, "I bring out the best in you," and that is true in terms of humor, spirit and ambition.  One of these days I will send him, as a birthday gift, pink fuzzy dice for that car of his (this will probably happen when I get a job, 'cause these are the lean times for grad students in terms of cash)...either that or his very own Duke hat.       --Varenia

						    Work:  Pages read: 0 Pages written (fic): 2+ Pages written (non-fic): 0  Comments:  Today was marred by a sad email from my mother--it sucks when she's down and there's not much I can do.  I think I wrote her a good response though.  As is often the case when I am worried or concerned for someone, my productivity goes down.  I wrote fiction before I read Mom's email.  I'm sitting here and I desperately want a Coke, but I know I should refrain, because I ought to go to bed as early as possible tonight so that I can get up and run, lift and shower before I go to Mass (I'll be writing more about Mass and things related tomorrow, I'll bet).  I'm actually going to check out the Mass listings of other churches in town, so we'll see how that goes.  The things I  need  to do tomorrow are grade, clean up the room, and start poking around for Margot's present.  I have received many emails from my undergrads over the weekend--I need to have some of my fellow graduate students review my assignment guidelines to see if they could be clearer (or to the point, are they unclear?), because I have received a lot of requests for clarification on things I thought were clear (then again, I wrote the things, so one would hope I understand them).  I hope to hear from Aaron tomorrow, as I believe he will be back from his vacation with his grandparents.  I should give Margot a call as well to see when she is getting in from NC.  I also need to look around my room for my key card, as it has gone missing (I fear I lent it to someone, but I hope that is not the case).

						   Today is my "right hand's" birthday.  She is celebrating it with her family, as she should, but she will be back here early in the week so that we may cause trouble and do the things we generally do.    Words fail to express how much I appreciate what she does for me.  She knows all of my secrets, and instead of thinking less of me, she's always there when I need to talk.  She listens carefully to the fears and insecurities that everyone else dismisses, and will engage me in serious discussion.  She is gifted with patience, empathy and kindness--I am a much better person because she is my friend.  I remember when I first came to graduate school--I went about my usual "I'm in a new place" strategy, which involved acting rather cool and distant so that I could evaluate everyone before acting.  In retrospect, it was a childish way to behave--making people come to me and draw me out--but she did just that, dragging me along to every social event she could (even when I'd put on airs about not wanting to go).  Now I'm more open and more confident, and I wonder what I would have been had she not been so insistent back then.  I'm sure I would be less of a person.  I just hope I can be as good a friend to her as she is to me.  --Varenia

						    Walked:  3 days  Weights:  3 days  Eating:  Not bad, actually.  I was pretty bad on Thursday night--I pigged out while watching the NBA Draft--but other than that, I've been able to keep it reasonable.  I'm especially proud of myself for sticking to one Coke a day (down from 3-4/day in recent weeks).  However, I am starting to get bored with the types of food I got on my last grocery trip, so I'll have to make sure I get different things when I go this week.  Commentary:   I met my minimum goals for the week in terms of exercise.  I wish that I could have walked one more day this week, but I was unable to stare down the heat on Friday, and I overslept badly on Tuesday.  Summers are difficult.  Since the gym's hours don't mesh with my schedule, I have to walk outside.  However, I have terrible sensitivity to heat (which is even worse than it used to be because I'm not in shape), and if it is sunny, more than 75 degrees, and there is any humidity, my energy vanishes.  It's awful.  On today's walk, the conditions varied wildly--when I started and finished it was grey and there was a bit of a breeze.  The sun came out in the middle, and when it was out, I felt exhausted--yet at the end of my walk, when the sun ducked under a cloud, I felt pretty good.  This means I should, ideally, walk before 9am (of the three walks, the most pleasant was at 6am (!), while the other two started around 10am), OR after 8pm.  Walking after 8pm is a sketchy thing because this campus is  deserted  after everything closes (between 4-5pm), and I'd be all by myself.  I guess this means I have to haul myself out of bed earlier.   Today's Walk:    The weather was not ideal, but I found another "course" to walk, bringing my total to three (I think this is good, as variety should keep me motivated...if I don't feel like doing the Gibbons walk, I can do something else).  This one takes me back to the Douglass graduation field (that's not its name, but I don't know what it is called), and I do a few trips up and down the steps, which can't hurt.  Both the Douglass and Cook fields have sad brown spots where the graduation platforms were (they finally moved them, a month later)--it sorta sums up the entire University during the summer.  I know most of my fellow grad students love the quiet, but I hate it; it just makes me want to sleep and be lazy.  35/44

						    Work:  Pages read: 0 Pages written (non-fic.): 1 Pages written (fic): 1  Comments:  Today wasn't quite as useless as the "stats" make it look.  For one thing, I finally wrote a page of my dissertation--the first one I've managed all month.  I spent at least a couple of hours dealing with students and class-related issues, and managed to make it to the library and Post Office before they both closed.  Although I only managed a page today, I'm about halfway there in terms of writing chapter one of TGoP.  I do need to get my rear in gear in terms of non-teaching academic work though, because July is going to fly by, and I will be very busy in August (I am so glad I decided against going to the conference in mid-August--I'd be ready to kill myself now).  My life is going to be so harried until January that I can't really imagine it.  The major hassle of the day had to do with horse insurance, which ends up being a pair in my rear every single year no matter what I do.  In smaller news, I installed Firefox today after reading about the latest  urlLink IE fark-up  on CNET.  Tabbed browsing is indeed very cool.  I also heard from a friend that had been "ignoring" me for some time--it was nice to get a long email from him...helped convince me that he hasn't suddenly decided to start hating my guts (good to see that I'm so secure in myself).  His birthday is Sunday and my best friend in grad school's birthday is tomorrow, and she returns here on Sunday or Monday, so I need to find her a nice gift!  The boyfriend is still out of touch, so I probably won't hear from him 'til Sunday or Monday either.  I was also able to get in touch with Sean via phone, so that's another goal achieved.

						   As with everything I write here, this is all merely my opinion...  Over the past couple of days, there have been many  urlLink FARK.com  comment threads regarding marriage.  Three of my friends were engaged this semester, and another close friend of mine has already gone through a broken engagement, so the topic has been on my mind.  I have to admit, I was surprised at the hostility toward marriage--many people linked to and agreed with  urlLink NoMarriage.com  and similar sites.  I know that as FARK goes so does  not  go the majority, but I found the lack of hope very sad.  Then again, I'm 23 and still involved in my first relationship, so what do I know?  I'll admit, there is still much I need to learn, but I feel that during the course of my relationship my thoughts on marriage have matured.  Here's where I stand now--  Complete independence (or dependence) cannot be completely satisfying:   I feel this is the most important thing I have learned.  Perhaps this revelation is bound up with the larger (and more general) issue of trusting people, but I've finally learned to let down my guard a bit, and I feel more complete than I ever have before.  It's a bit Rousseauian--I give up my autonomy to become a better person.  Marriage is beautiful because it represents two people promising to forgo complete independence because they believe they make each other better.  On the other hand, marriage is not a necessity for a good life, and there are good dependencies and bad ones (unfortunately I'm still sort in the "I know it when I see it" stage of definition).  One does not have to depend on other people--I was probably at my happiest when I was single and my dependence on God and faith was at its strongest.  This leads me to the second lesson...  Patience is a virtue:   I just can't understand the mindset behind a short dating/engagement period (I'm not saying it never works out or that it is wrong, I'm just saying I don't understand it).  I know that I don't have the faculties necessary to judge whether or not a person is right for me in so short a time.  I have a friend who's been engaged for a LONG time, and I admire her patience.  Most people are blessed with many years on this earth; there's no need to hurry into such a commitment.    Know Thyself:   Words to live by in all things, of course, but quite important in relation to marriage.  Before you can seek out people who make you better, you need to have some idea of what needs "bettering," so to speak.     Don't settle--there is someone for you:   This has been the second-hardest thing for me to learn.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to marry someone that you are both compatible with and attracted to!  One should not feel guilty for wanting both.  Our culture has reached the point where it mocks those who (apparently) marry based on superficialities such as attractiveness, but I still detect a certain amount of guilt-tripping placed on those who want to end relationships with good people because they don't feel the physical attraction (I do believe there is a difference between true physical attraction/compatibility and merely thinking someone is "hot").  This may be the most "immature" of all my statements, but I wonder how many people are in "guilt" marriages and what sort of resentment they feel.  Children are OK:   True pain, but this is the lesson that assures me that I really have matured when it comes to thinking about this stuff.  I'm Roman Catholic (at least I try to be), and the RCC demands that marriages be open to the possibility of children.  I'm not a particular fan of tykes, so whenever the thought of marriage entered my mind, it was attended by such thoughts as, "Gee, maybe I'll be lucky and be barren."  I've re-evaluated that line of thinking and come to the conclusion that if I find someone that makes me better in the way that I believe a husband should, children probably wouldn't be the nightmare I imagine them to be.  These are not meant to be mind-blowing statements--just a summary of where I'm at in thinking about the topic.  I may look back on this in a few years and call myself a fool, but I hope that's not the case.  --Varenia

						    7/11/04  Nichole moved out on Friday and she left me some things to give to Stacey.  Stacey had called me about these things on Friday, but her message had been on my phone along with the unpleasant one, so I pretty much forgot about it.  She called me on Sunday morning about these things, and when I picked up the phone, I misread my clock--I thought it was in the afternoon.  Hilarity (for her) ensued, as I tried to pretend that I hadn't just woken up.  I didn't do so well in that department.  The day was a comedy of me falling asleep when I should have been awake.  Aaron finally got me up for good around 4:30pm when he called about dinner (I had wanted to see  Prisoner of Azkaban  again, but farked it up by sleeping too late).  He and I had a nice dinner and then we went to Hickman to do battle with the copy machine.  Jay was in the computer lab, and he and I had a jolly old time laughing it up over various and sundry.  Aaron and I looked at HP theories (Snape as vampire?!), and generally screwed around until he decided that he had to go prepare for his class.  I felt so much better when I got home.  Mom and I had a nice conversation and I generally felt a lot better about things when I fell asleep (around 8am Monday morning).  7/12/04  I had decided to finish cookies on Sunday night/Monday morning, and I drank Coke and ate cookies as I poured over websites (during my particularly dark hours, I retreated into the escapism of fanfic, etc.).  However, I felt myself getting tired, and I knew I had to be up at noon to go visit Stip's parents, so I tried to sleep.  This was only partially successful, and when I had to wake up, I was miserable and felt sick to my stomach.  The drive was horrendous--I felt like I was going to toss my cookies (har, har, har) the entire time.  I got my orders from Stip's mom--so long as I can figure out the computers this shouldn't be too bad--and Stip and I had a great dissertation conversation (of course, I didn't work on the damn thing when I got home, but I spent most of yesterday being very tired) on the way home.  I didn't do much the rest of the day, and I ended up going to bed before 11pm because I was just zoinked.

						    Comments:  The less said about these two days, the better.  I got news so bad it left me in the "lacking will to get out of bed" stage.  Of course, I was unable to work on  anything , and the feeling of uselessness plus the feeling of guilt was a nasty combination.  My eating and sleeping became super irregular, so that was another nice feature.  I was almost completely reversed in terms of sleeping (i.e., I was sleeping all day and waking up around 5pm).   9P

						   Well, my exercising this week was terrible, because I had lots to do, it was quite warm for most of the week, and I had a couple of major down days.  However, my eating was also not as disastrous as it was last week--I went a little nutty on cookies on Saturday-Sunday-something (it was so late and I was so down I really didn't know or care what day it was).  I need to start exercising and continuing the decent and moderate eating habits.   35/44

						    Work:  Tuesday and Wednesday I did little work because I was preparing for class.  However, I did keep up my pace with TGoP.  On Thursday, I made a huge breakthrough in TGoP and I read quite a bit of Smith and Locke.  However, I did not write on my diss.  Comments:  Tuesday was an absolutely useless day.  I did nothing but dicker with my fiction writing and stare at my dissertation files, which I had up in a vain attempt to make myself write something.  Instead of preparing my closing remarks, I just grabbed last year's notes, which as you will see, was a mistake.  On Wednesday I was more industrious out of necessity.  It was the last day of class, so I managed to leave in enough time to check my mail and try to attend to business at Hickman.  However, when I arrived shortly after 4pm, the place was deserted.  I'm sure it had something to do with the construction going on.  I sat around in my office, and no one came.  I was somewhat worried that class attendance would be dismal.  Before going down to class, I stopped by the third floor seminar room, and just stood in the doorway.  I remember when my entire world focused on that one small room with one table that had less than twenty chairs around it.  All I had to do was prepare myself to discuss things in that room, with my friends, three or four times a week, and I was successful.  I don't even know what the hell's happened to me since the start of Spring 2004--I feel so old all of a sudden.  I'm looking seriously at jobs, and wondering how I will finish my diss., get a book contract, publish articles and teach enough classes to look good on the job market.  On Wednesday, I wished I could just sit in the seminar room and talk about things with my friends.  Once again, I fear that I am moving much too quickly, but I know that I have also managed to commit myself past the point of return.  I taught my last class.  They were dead (though 22/30 showed up), and my closing remarks were less than brilliant because I brought the wrong notes, though I still garnered a few smiles.  I don't know if it was just my mood, but I was very wistful in saying good-bye to them, and when the sentiment was seemingly unreturned, I was rather hurt.  I realized, after about five minutes or so, that I'd forgotten something, so I returned downstairs, and they were all done with their teaching evaluations.  I was hurt that they'd finished so quickly, so I retreated to the computer lab for a bit.  Nichole made an excellent observation on the situation--the students just don't conceive of us as humans with feelings.  Thursday was brightened by an email from Clay.  I told him about the MotS, and he seemed delighted.  He asked some questions that were funny, but I took them seriously, as is my wont.  I came up with some absolutely brilliant ideas in response to him.  He has ever brought out the best in me.  Aaron returned as well, and it was so wonderful to see him again!  We went out to dinner, and had a lovely, enjoyable discussion that was like an answer to my prayers in the seminar room yesterday.  It lasted for almost two hours, and it seemed like 45 minutes.  We focused our discussion around my NEPSA paper and a few of my later diss. chapters and how they relate to one of his potential dissertation ideas.  I am so lucky and blessed to be pursuing a job that I love so much.  I came home and messed around online for some time--some of my students were demanding their grades by email.  Ugh, I hate grades!  I IMed with Mom, and then I sat down to read.  I finished Mandragola, and I read significant parts of the First Treatise and the Lectures on Rhetoric by Smith.  I hope to continue the pace tomorrow, and to add in some writing.

						   No one's around, nothing's open, and the total lack of tactile contact with my species is starting to get on my nerves--ugh!  Nothing is updated--oh well, at least the heat isn't keeping me from anything.  On the other hand,  urlLink K is staying , hurrah, hurrah!  I love that man sooooooo much.    I also have to amend a comment I made yesterday.  While the day was physically boring, I did make some major strides in my dissertation and my fiction writing, and I came up with a felicitous way to describe life in RTP.  The day was by no means a total loss.  --Varenia

						   Work: Finished Ch. 1 of TGoP.  Wrote the first page of Ch. 2 Wrote approx. 4 pages of diss. Comments: Well, I worked well, but I didn't do much else.  Today was BORING.  I didn't get dressed, I didn't go outside, heck, I only saw one other human being (briefly).  I did get work done, though.  Once again, I did a lot of modding at TDD (no banning, sadly), and I read some of the Dukies' old stuff.  Reading their stuff is great.  I remember everything about those games--the hype, the stupid stories, the idiotic quotes, the bad calls, and it all comes back so vividly when reading their articles.  They bring back the days when I was a Triangle insider--I appreciate the jokes on so many levels, because you really had to be there to "get it."  I'm so sad that I'm not there right now.  I was thinking about '01, and that happy day in March when Cassie and I got back into her car after a lovely dinner at Outback, with the North Carolina sun still shining, and the first thing we heard when we turned on the radio was Woody Durham lamenting the Heels' loss to Penn St.  I had spent the earlier part of that weekend in Greensboro watching Duke win two NCAA games, and this was just the topper to the whole weekend.  It was one of those little moments that you cannot have unless you live in a place--really live in it.  It cannot be recreated; nothing that I love about RTP can be recreated.  That is why it is so disappointing to visit.  I try to put myself in the same situations and places that yielded those great moments, and they are always disappointing.  Life cannot be forced--and what I experienced in those two years was the beauty of living life, amplified by a place I loved and good people.  It was the beautiful irregularity of normal, day-to-day life in RTP that captured my heart, and I won't rediscover that until I live there again.

						   Ugh, what a disaster.  The wheels came off this week--Margot's return visit was a convenient excuse for me to do nothing.  I only exercised one day this week, and that was Sunday.  I ate poorly multiple times during the week, particularly the last two days where I sat and ate and drank Coke.  I need to turn to water instead of Coke, and I need to go get myself something to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings (all I have here are salty foods, and that's just not cutting it at all--I just eat and eat and eat, feeling unsatisfied all the while).  I'm turning to food and its preparation out of boredom and a desire to avoid work, I believe, as the bad eating and continual stuffing of my face did not begin until Margot left and I really sat down to make myself work on my dissertation.  In order to prevent such a disastrous repeat, I need to a)drink water, or even juice, instead of Cokes, b)make myself go out--either morning or evening, it is my choice, but I must do it, c)next time I go shopping come up with some sort of snack or "entertainment" for myself when I'm working (gum, mints, etc).  I need to just pick up again this coming week, and not let myself fall into old bad habits. 36/45

						    Work:  Fiction: 4 pages Non-fiction: 2 pages  Comments:  This was a quiet day.  No phone calls, no nothing.  I woke up around 2pm, and proceeded to eat way too much.  I worked on TGoP, and the first chapter is almost done--which is frightening.  My diss work didn't go as well; certainly I was not as productive as I was yesterday.  I spent much of my free time moderating at TDD.  I spent a lot of time reading "how-to" articles on Sci-Fi and Fantasy publishing--time that would have been better spent working, of course.  I wish I had more to write, but I really don't, as I didn't do all that much.  I am not going to bed yet, so hopefully I will be able to write more on my disseration.  My reading has suffered badly, and I should make sure I'm up to date with all my students' emails tomorrow.

						    Work:  Wrote four pages of my dissertation and two plus pages of fiction!  Go me!  Comments:  Said goodbye to Margot again.  V. sad.  Worked all day (I must call my sister tomorrow, as I was supposed to call her tonight and did not).  Have a lot of family things to do tomorrow...I hope I don't sleep so late that they don't get done.  I'm quite proud of myself for banging out the pages on my dissertation.  I also modded heavily at TDD today, as the iiidjits are out in force, of course.  I should be quite tired, as I couldn't have received more than 6 hours of sleep, but I stayed up all day without taking a nap.  Unfortunately, I've been flat awful, and I had three cokes today.  So very bad!  I craved sweets all night, and I didn't walk or lift--I'll have to do at least one tomorrow.  Obviously I need to work on balance--things fell apart in terms of diet/exercise once Margot arrived.  Erg.  I should clean tomorrow.

						   I despise summer with every fiber of my being.  I actually like my work (as an academic), and I also like my work environment to be active and flourishing.  Campus is dead as a doornail, even with summer classes in session, and it slows down the pace of my work, which is a Bad Thing when I have so much of it to do.  June was quite the struggle this year--it is usually July before I start to drag down.  The next six months will weigh on me heavily, and I want September to come around so that I can have people to lean on.  However, I can take solace in the fact that one-third of the Wretched Three Months has passed (and August will be much more active than it usually is, since I will be taking a little vacation).  July will be rough--it will be all work and very little play.  Still, if I can be productive during the month, it will go a long way toward making me a much happier person.  The month will end with a visit from Jessica, which is something to look forward to, and my move will also take place during this month, clearing August for the "fun stuff" of getting geared up for the next academic year.  So, at any rate, July, enjoy your reign.  --Varenia

						   Work: I wrote two+ fic pages on the 30th. Comments: I'm getting old, I tells ya--I can barely remember what happened on the 30th.  That's probably because I didn't get out of bed until almost 3pm.  As I recall, I taught class, and then went grocery shopping with Margot.  It was a pretty uneventful day, since Gordon wasn't in Hickman for me to chat with.  On Thursday, I finally got the horse insurance thing resolved, and ran more errands with Margot.  Ugh, July is going to be a nightmare.  We went to NYC and saw the  Threepenny Opera .  It was quite excellent, and it played at a theater that does classic plays only (which is nice--hopefully they'll do  Macbeth  soon (unfortunately their Shakespeare offering for '04-'05 is  Romeo and Juliet ).  The train ride was a disaster both ways--more reminders that New Jersey is truly the Land of the Troll People.  Of course, the major news concerns Coach K...I can't fathom what I'd do if he left Duke--I really can't.  He's coached there all my life.  I want him to retire there.  I know I have no right to be any part of this decision, and he needs to do what is best for him and his family, but...STAY K, STAY!
