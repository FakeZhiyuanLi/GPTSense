       I feel really bad right now about some crazy stuff! I realy hate what is going on with some of my friends. I hurt one of them (i did not mean to!) and i mad at myself for it!  AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!   I hope every thing works out ok! cause i dont want to lose a good friend!  I aked this girl to a party that our youth group was haveing (we used to go out but we r just friends now) but i asked her becuse i had no one eles to ask! she said yes (and that we were just going as friends) then later that week another guy asked her, she turned him down for me. i told her if she wants to go with this guy then go, we r just going as friends neway. i did not care! but she said she wanted to go with me.  Well, then on the day before the party, there is this other girl that i have had a crush on for like ever! and never thought she would never go out with me, but we were talking and i asked her out, she said yes! I talked it over with her and told her i was still gonna go to the party with the girl i asked to the party (I was not going to stand her up!!!) and she said she was still gonna go to the party with a guy that asked her. (but after the party we would be going out) so we were at the party and went up to the girl i asked, and she seemed like she did not wanna talk to me! I asked her if she wanted her pic taken with me, She said no! so i said "oh come on, lets go get a pic taken" she still said no! so i said "ok i guess i will go get one with my g/f" (she already knew i had a g/f) then i was gonna sit with her her but she ignored me! so i went and hung out with my g/f instead (the guy she was there with was not even with her, he was flirting with other girls) But now The other girls is upset with me! AND I TRIED TO BE THERE WITH HER! I just dont no what to do!
