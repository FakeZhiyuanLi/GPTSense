       Today is like any other day since Jesse first left, Nov. 29, 2003. It has been a month, one month, but it feels so much longer than then. The funny thing is that his eighteen month leave didn’t officially start until December 7 so I guess that is the date I should count down from or maybe I should wait until the day he gets overseas, the I can start counting a year from then. This whole thing is so unorganized I am beginning to wonder why these people are in control of our nations security. Everything has been so last minute, which makes me; wonder if I can truly trust them with the health and welfare of my husband let alone 435 other soldiers. How am I going to make sure that he is getting the care that he needs? I guess it bothers me to think that complete strangers are going to be in control of my husband’s life for the next year to eighteen months. I have spent the last six years of my life being in Jesse’s life in one way or the next, we lived together for a little over two years in the apartment that I am slowly packing up. That task has to be the most depressing thing I have had to do ever. I am packing up our life together and stuffing it all in an 10x15x9.5 foot storage with this big steal master-lock to keep it safe. It’s sort of funny to think about it, two years of two peoples life packed away in a storage unit, in just a matter of a few weeks.   I guess I am just really scared. I mean at least the last time Jesse had to go away for military duty he was still in the U.S. which made it a bit easier to deal with him being gone, but now he is going overseas, a place where there is fighting and mass violence, a place where children have semi-automatic guns and women have no rights, a place where Americans really aren’t welcomed. Why would they send our children, husbands, wives, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, parents and cousins to a place where they aren’t wanted? Its just scary to think about it.

       Today was especially hard for me. I am still in the process of packing up all of Jesse and mines possessions and moving back in with my mom. I am a little scared of the whole thing and really do not like the idea of being away from Jesse. Our Christmas was wonderful and I am so glad that we got a chance to see each other although I am wondering if it would have been easier if he hadn’t come home, four days just wasn’t enough time. Having to say goodbye again was so hard. Now that I think back I am not to sure I actually said goodbye to him, I think I just said have a safe flight, I love you and call me in between flights. This is going to be so hard for me I hate it when he is away and this time he is going to be gone for the minimum of twelve months. We do not know where he is going except that it is somewhere in Iraq. While he is away we will try to save up enough money to buy a house. I hope we can get enough money saved up so when he comes home we can start the family we had been talking about.  Yesterday he went back to Ft. Bliss TX. We don’t know how long he is going to be there.   I think one of my biggest fears is that Jesse will come back different then he was. I know he will always love me, maybe even more than I think, but I am so afraid that things aren’t going to be the same when he gets home. I mean a year is a long time. We have only been married for eight months and I hate the idea that I will not be able to spend our 1 year wedding anniversary together. I know he doesn’t like the idea of being away on that day either.   April 19, 2003 was the day we were married. If I knew then what I know now about Jesse’s unit being mobilized, I would have still said I do. That day was so wonderful and that night was the first time I felt like Jesse finally belonged to me & that I finally belonged somewhere. We found out on the day of our six year anniversary of being together, November 14, that his unit was being mobilized and that was the day I felt the feeling of belonging being taken away from me. That was the day that our lives had been changed and our fate had been determined for us. I sit here and all I can think is that this whole thing isn’t fair.  But what can you do?

       This has been a long week. School has definitely kept me a busy body. I have actually been so worn out that when I get home in the evening I get so tired all I really want to do is sleep. I have talked to Jesse off and on all week but the calls are getting more spread out and shorter. I have a feeling they are keeping him plenty busy and that he is feeling the same way I do from day to day, tired and exhausted. I booked our hotel room for march and am looking forward to seeing him, I miss the world of him and I would give anything to hold him for 5 minutes. I just never thought I could miss someone as much as I miss him. My brother is coming over to work on my computer tomorrow so as soon as Saturday night I should have a computer I can go online with, I’ve been writing these at work, shhhhhh.  I can’t wait to get back online and be able to hook up my web cam so he can see me. I told him I have changed since Christmas, and I want him to see. I’ve lost some weight and I want to show myself off to him. He said he was so proud of me so I am glad. I wish he would send me a picture of himself soon, I am curious as to how much he has changed since he has been gone. When he came home for Christmas he looked a little different. I made the mistake of not getting a picture of him then, but you can count on me taking my camera when I get to see him.

       Today I heard a  rumor. Danielle Barber, the wife of a soldier station with Jesse, informed me that her husband was told that he, and a few other soldiers, were possibly going to be deployed earlier than the rest of the pack. When I told Jesse about this he said he hadn't heard anything about this but that there were tons of rumors going around right now. This could be good news if they get to come home 3 weeks earlier then the rest, however it could also be bad news as well. Danielle and I were planning to fly to Texas in March to spend a few days with our husbands and in fact I had even spend the day with her on Sunday, buying a few new clothes to wear for our trip, and a few lacey items as well. I know I shouldn't get my hopes up for anything involving this whole ordeal but the fact of the matter is that hope is all I really have. I hope that David (Danielle's husband), Jesse and the rest of those who might have to go early, don't have to leave without the rest of the unit, and that they all leave at the same time. I want to fly to Texas to see Jesse, I feel like it is something I need to do.   I feel like the ARMY is taking more then they give.

       today was a good day. Today was the first day back to school. I think I will be plenty busy this semester which is what I had hoped for. I talked to Jesse today and it is sounding more and more like he wants me to come to El Paso to see him on his 4 day break before he sets off for the giant sandbox. He said that even though he knew it was going to be hard for him to let go he felt he needed to see me one last time before he had to go overseas. I told him the decision was all his and I would respect whatever he felt was right to do. I cant wait to see him though, i miss him so much. It will be so great to see him.

       Today Jesse sent me a few pictures from New Mexico. I attempted to post them but to no avail. I will keep on trying though.

       Nothing really new today. I talked to Jesse a little in the morning and yesterday for a little bit as well. I know that they are so busy and he needs to concentrate on his work. He needs  to be a soldier and not husband it's just I miss my husband dammit. I wish he was coming home already, but the fact is that he hasn't gotten overseas yet. Yesterday he told me that a bunch of people from his company were going to be sent to support other companies within his unit/battalion. It is a good possibility that Jesse will be one of the group that have to support the other companies. He said that they do not know where they are going to be stationed yet but that it has been confermed that one group will be stationed in Kuwait. I really hope Jesse windes up there. The minute we found out that he was being mobilized i hoped that he would go to Kuwait.   I just hope we find out soon where they are going to place him. I hate waiting.

       Today I talked to Jesse a little bit, I was probibly for just 2 minutes, but it was enough to satisfy me... He told me it was raining where they were at. Fot two days he said. I wish it would rain here. All it has been is overcast. I told Jesse a few days back that the sun when away when he left and I haven't seen it since. I told he he had to come home so the sun would shine again. He had said, he wished he could. I miss him so much.   Today I was checking out other people blogs and came across one for a guy named  urlLink Jeremy Blotter . He is currently overseas stationed in the "Sand Box" as they like to call it. I emailed him and thanked him for writing his blog. I told him that It was so nice to see a person's view of what was going on from someone who was actually over there living it. I hope he emails me back.  In other news, my visit with my landlord went good. I let my mom do all of the talking, I found out after we were on the way back to the house, that they were thinking of raising the rent in the building. I hope that if they do they will deside to take better care of the place... at lease with the cheap rent they were able to avoid it, if the rent is raised then the tenant will expect the landlord to tend to repairs and such in a timly manner, not like they did before. I am sure whatever the rent goes up to though, they will find someone to rent it no problem.  oh well, that $400.00 I get to save a month now! TTYL

       Today is the day I turn my apartment keys over to my landlord and the last time I step foot in that apartment. I have many memories of that place and will always remember the good and bad times that were had there. The last of the apartment was packed up last Sunday and carted over to my mom’s place. It was very strange to stand in the empty living room and look into the empty kitchen. I grew so used to seeing it filled with a collections of old papers and magazines, tons of DVD’s/ CD’s, everything that was either placed into storage or in the garage of my mom’s house. It looked and smelled the same as it did 2 years and 3 months earlier. It was just a strange feeling to be there again, but this time without Jesse by my side.   In other news, Jesse is doing ok He found out earlier this week that the training he did, the 3 weeks in Arizona, were for nothing and now they aren’t going to be able to use the equipment they got trained on. This really bummed Jesse out, he was mad because they made him and 3 other guys, leave 2 weeks before the rest of his unit to do this special training and now it was all for nothing. You all can imagine how pissed Jesse was. He said that the military took 2 weeks away from him that he could have spent home with me. Everything was just cut so short and last minute. But what do you expect from the ARMY? Other than that he is doing good.   In other news, next week I start school again. I am taking a bunch of Early Childhood Education classes, to help me pass the time away. I am looking forward to this, going back to school and getting back into the swing of things. Last semester I took home classes so I wasn’t at the campus, it was sort of my way of taking time off from school, but not taking a semester off. It will be great to get back to school and keep my mind busy. TTYL

       Yesterday was the day from hell. I will however spare you the gruesome details. However I will share this with you. Yesterday I got a call from Jesse. He told me he had something to tell me that might make my day worse. I told him I highly doubted that but to share any way. He told me that yesterday he found out that the three weeks he spent in Arizona was now for nothing. That the equipment they trained him on they are not going to use when they get overseas.  He said so basically the ARMY took three weeks away from him that he could have spent with me helping with the apartment and getting a chance to spend a little more time with me then he got to. I felt real bad after hearing this and wondered if the Military liked wasting money to send their soldiers to training they wined up not using. It makes me mad when I think about it. Everything was rush, rush for no reason. I really do hate this.

       First and formost I miss my husband. After the week I have had all I really want is to have Jesse home to hug me and tell me everything will be ok. Yesterday in the midst of all of the mayham Jesse called me at the apartment. I felt so stressed I was about to cry. I was hopeing for some words of encouragment and all I got was a "calm down honey" that's it! what happened to the guy I fell in love with who knew exactly what to say to me when I was too stressed to think for myself? One of my fears feels like it is comming true. He has changed. I miss talking to him so much, sure I have had plenty of opportunities to talk to him on the phone but not how I wanted our conversations to go. I wish he could ask me how I was doing for once. I know he must be so busy, butI wonder if he know what I am going through back here without him? I feel so lost and helpless. I just wish he was home and this nightmare was over with. My family has been great to me, My mom and brother and sister have all been there 100%. mY Ssister and I finished the last of the cleaning of the aparetment today and I am turning my keys into our landloard on wednesday after I get off of work. The terror of not having a military ID has come and gone and throught some creative thinking all that felt lost was slowly but surly redeemed. Now on to bigger things. Tomorrow My mom and I are going out to McClallin to try to get someone to help me make heads or tails out tof the Tricare forms (Health Insurence) then before you know it I will be fully covered for all health care by the military for the duration of Jesse's leave. This will be good. I hope everything will go fine. I am going to wrap this one up for the night, even though it is only about a quarter after 9 pm I am a little tired still from all of the stress and hard labor of the past week. I hope to get on again soon, still working on getting my computer up and running, and used to not having cable internet anymore (Back to dial up for me). Thanks for listening to my whining,.

       Today I feel like I am alone again. I want to go out but now I am back at my mom’s house I can’t just walk back home when I go out, plus there really isn’t any place to go in my mom’s neighborhood. I am back to planning my activities around the bus schedule which, in my opinion, really isn’t what its cracked up to be. One of the things I am going to work on while Jesse is gone is getting my license. That way I pick him up from the airport when he comes home, surprise him by being the only one there and maybe develop some sort of social life outside of work and school. Jesse told me that they are entitled to a few days a month leave, but he doesn’t think he will take it and come home to visit. I sort of want him to though. I miss him so much it would be nice to see him once in a great while. I do however understand where he is coming from though, we have already had to say goodbye two times and that was hard enough, he really doesn’t want to go through that again and I don’t blame him. I hated saying goodbye for the second time, when he came back for Christmas; it was a lot harder to let him go. In my mind I was thinking no fair he just came home, why can he stay longer?  I talked to him a little bit yesterday; he seemed to be getting along well. I know the other day when we were about to get off the phone with each other he told me that he loved me and he missed me “like hell”, I needed to hear him say that. Something inside of me knew that he missed me but need to hear it. Meanwhile, back on the home front, the apartment is pretty much cleaned out, all but two rooms. Tomorrow everyone is going to meet up at the apartment and finish it off, hopefully. My sister is even coming to shampoo the rugs, get the pet smells out. Wednesday is when we turn the keys in. I told my mom when I get the deposit back I am going to take her, my brother and his Girlfriend, out to dinner… maybe I’ll take my sister too, but I am not to sure if I will or not because she really hasn’t done much to help. My Mom, Brother, and Candace (his Girl Friend) have done a lot of packing and lifting and moving and carting boxes for me so I think they deserve something nice. It’s the least I can do for them, besides say thank you.   With all of the things on my mind, for some reason I just can’t stop thinking about Jesse. I miss him so much. I would give anything just to see him. I wish we could videoconference with each other, and then at least I could see him. I miss seeing him, I miss his voice, I miss his amazing eyes, I guess that’s what I get for being in love.

       Monday Jesse called me. He was so happy the phone charger finally got to him, it was shipped from overseas on December 22nd. He said that afternoon when they did mail call, and he heard his name, he knew exactly what it was. He had told me that he was bummed all weekend because he couldn’t call home and he missed me. He also wanted to tell me that they were getting their weapons issued and set to start 21-day field training within the next day. He wasn’t too sure where they were going to be at but he thought it would still be somewhere in Texas. Then yesterday morning he called me. He said asked me to guess where he was but I didn’t know. He told me that he was in the middle of B.F.E. (bum F**k Egypt) New Mexico. He told me that where they were he could see nothing but dirt for miles and off in the horizon mountains. They also upgraded sleeping quarters. He told me that now they were in buildings instead of a giant circus tent, granite the buildings they were going to be sleeping in dated back to WWII, but he said to me at least there are walls and a ceiling. He said they were about 20 miles or so from where the first Nuclear Bomb was tested. I asked how he weather was and he told me is was very windy and he had to stand behind a convoy to block the wind so he could hear me.   I am so glad they go to start this portion of their training because this is what he has been waiting for. I am pretty sure this is the portion of mobilization where they get to learn about how to handle themselves in battle situations. I hope for their sakes they never have to use the skills they are going to learn. He should be getting back to Ft. Bliss around his Birthday and a few weeks later off they go overseas, somewhere. We still don’t know where they are going to be stationed but I pray every night that it will be somewhere safe. Jesse is working with a great bunch of guys and I know they will watch each other’s backs. So that does comfort me a lot. I just want all of this to go by fast so he can be on his way home instead of soon to be departing.  In other news we are almost done with moving me out of the apartment. I am so greatful for my mom and my brother for being there to help me. I made them a promise that onces this is all done I am going to ake them out to dinner with the cleaning deposit we get back. I told my mom that I wanted to take them to Red Lobster... maybe well go to Joe's Crab Shack instead. I am set to be out of the apartment next tuesday. and I have a good feeling about it. I have noticed in the last few days I have spent at my mom's house I have not had problems sleeping. aBefore I would stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning because I couldn't sleep. Once everything is finished I look forward to plenty of good night sleep.

       Saturday Jesse finally called, we had a nice talk. He said it has been really busy at the base and I understand there is a lot to take care of before they go over seas. In other news this last weekend I have been packing up the apartment and have unofficially, but officially have moved back to my mom's. I will try to add new entries but I am not to sure how long my computer will be down. Don't worry though, I have plenty of opportunities to use computers so I will not be gone for too long, but rest asure I will try to keep this blog updated.

       Today I wrote Jesse a 5 page letter expressing my feelings about our situtation. I made the decision to mail this letter at the end of the weekend if he still hasn't called me. The last phone conversation I had with him was last monday. He didn't even call on New Years which really upset me. I really want to be strong about the whole situation at hand but It is very hard if the person I am trying to support cannot even call me to even just say hello. Last time we talked I asked him to call as often as he could, even if it meant he had to call collect or buy a phone card. I do hope for his sake that whatever has been keeping him from calling me is important. So Jesse I say to you "if your ears are ringing, it's because I am thinking thoughts about you, so call me. Every day I have no call it makes me feel like you don't care what happenes to me. So please please please call home. I miss you and need to know you are ok."

       After spending the New Year pretty much alone, today I am filled with thought of anger. I feel awful that I am angry but mainly because of the person I am angry at, Jesse. I haven’t talked to him in a few days and I am worried I wish he would just call. They have the day off today, this I found out from Danielle Barber, her husband is stationed with Jesse. They got to go to a sporting event yesterday, over 2000 seats were donated to the base and a bunch of the guys from the 319th went, I am betting Jesse went to, I wouldn’t have blamed him. I guess I am upset because he didn’t call to tell me about this. Danielle told me that a bunch of guys went to a hotel last night, but she asked if Jesse went and her husband told her no because they had to go with their battle buddies and Jesse’s BB was ill. She also told me that a bunch of the guys were going out today to find a mall or something… I just wish he would call home. Sometimes I feel like he doesn’t care that he isn’t here, that he doesn’t even miss me. I mean what does it take to pick up a phone and call home? I am here packing up our lives alone and he is out having fun. He just makes me so mad. I think about him every day, wondering how he is, is he feeling ok, wondering what sort of things did he do that day and still I hear nothing because his cell phone died? That is not an excuse! There are payphones and calling cards… I even told him to call me collect if he needed to. I guess I just needed someone to vent to even if it is to my BLOG, not like anyone reads this thing any way. I am having such a hard time I wish he could just pick up the phone for once and ask me how I am doing.   Please phone just ring….

       I went to the Doctors yesterday. Oh the wonders of TriCare!! For all of you who don’t know, TriCare is the medical coverage offered to the dependants of Military Personnel, it’s more of a bonus if the policy holder is active Duty… this means FREE coverage for the duration of their leave or Active Duty assignment. I guess you can call this a perk to having my loved one taken away from me. Any way, my new Doctor is very thorough, which I like. He has been testing me on anything he can to make sure that I am ok. He found from my first test, that my liver enzymes are high. He said that even though it isn’t a big deal now, this could lead to problems when I get older. He told me that “you are too young to be having these problems, and I want to find out why so we can correct it.” This made me feel good because my previous Doctor didn’t really seem to care when she found out my liver count was high. I do think that part of my problem is that I don’t drink enough water, YES Jesse I am finally admitting that I don’t drink enough water (he has been getting on my case about this little fact since, I don’t know, as long as wee have been together). So in the mean time, the Doctor is running more tests to see if he can pinpoint what is causing this. He told me to stay away from the alcohol and to see him when I get back from seeing Jesse in TX. So we’ll see what is to become of this.  In other news, there is only 5 days until my trip. I can’t wait to see Jesse. I miss him so much and as each day passes I begin to understand that in a few short weeks he will be making his long journey to another country. It is scary to think that he will be on the other side of the world, hundreds of thousand of millions of miles away, with a large body of ocean separating us. That when I look at the stars at night all he will see is a sunny sky. I feel like I wish I could go with him, I mean I am being left behind, but I am not the one who is going to a country he has never been to, with people he only really knew on a last name basis. I hope that his relationships with his peers are strong; I would hate to know that he is all alone over there.  I am glad that he decided to have me fly to see him. I think it would be easier for him if I went to him versus him coming home, that way its just me and him and no Mother-in-laws calling every 10 minutes wanting to see her son, or anything else like that. I feel that it is very important that we get some time alone to talk and just be together. (In actual reality, I want him all to myself… **Insert sinister laugh here**)

       Today, like any other day, is just that, another day. I posted a picture of Jesse in his uniform at work; right under a support banner I made for the 319th. I had a few people at work stop and ask me about the picture and I gladly gave them the information I had. I love talking about Jesse and what he is doing. I am so proud of him and I hope he understands that. I mean it is not every day I can say I know a soldier in the ARMY that is serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and really mean it. I mean I have had distant family serve and friends of friends and so forth, but I can safely say that I KNOW this soldier, he is my husband and I am so proud of what he is doing for our country. I am proud of what the rest of the 319th are doing as well as the rest of the soldiers who are currently serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. I have finally figured out a way to bring you some pictures that Jesse sent me. So I have included a few in this post. You can click on them to view a larger version of the photo.    urlLink       urlLink        urlLink        urlLink       I am glad I got a chance to share these photos with you and hope that in the future there will be more photos to share, "Jesse, love, keep them comming!"

       Today was a very good day. The potluck had a small but good turn out. I got to see Danielle and Baby Abi again. I also got to meet a few other family members of soldiers from the 319th HHC. One of the people I got to meet today was Gina Wilfong; she was very sweet but under the weather. I hope to get a chance to meet the rest of our FSG sooner or later. The event was fun. SPC Kinglsey showed us a few pictures he took while at Ft. Bliss TX. I got to see what the tent looked like that Jesse and all of our guys were in. It made me feel bad to think all our guys had to protect them from the outside was a giant vinyl tent. Last night Jesse sent me some pictures of him and a few of some other stuff and one of David. I sent the one of David to Danielle so she could have it.   Jesse looked so sad in his picture, it makes me wonder if he is really ok or if something is going on with him. We don’t get a chance to talk as much as I would like but then again sometimes we can’t always get what we want. I understand that eventually the calls will have to stop but right now I am not really willing to accept that fact. Tonight I am miss Jesse a lot. I am not too sure why I am feeling like this today, but I am really missing him. What I wouldn’t give for one of his powerful hugs and soft kisses. I would give anything to not have to go to an empty bed tonight and only have my teddy bear (Jesse Bear built with love from the Build-a-bear workshop) and my cat Pepper. I remember one time Jesse told me he remembered something I had said to him a long time ago. He said, “We fit together” lately I have been feeling like I am not whole, like I need my other part, the second piece to my puzzle. I often look at the sky and wonder if he is looking at the same thing as me. 9 time out of 10 you can bet he is looking for Orion, because he know that is the only constellation I could ever spot, besides the 2 dippers. Tonight I can’t see the stars, overcast, but I know deep down Jesse is thinking of me like I am of him.

       Today, I feel, is a going to be a good day. I have been kept pretty busy with work and school and for that I am grateful. I have plenty of Homework and plenty of work related work… in fact I really haven’t had much time to think for myself. Saturday is my first meeting with the wonderful group of the 319th Sig Bn Family support group. They scheduled a meet and greet/ potluck with a computer class to help all of those who need it (to get through the Yahoo Group that was set up by the Lt. Col.’s Wife. So far there has been a great outcome of support among the email group but I am not too sure that too many people are even going to show up on Saturday. Danielle Barber and I are going to car pool together, and I am hoping that I will get a chance to meet some of the people I have been chatting with in the email group.   I got to talk to Jesse last night but I wish I could say our conversation went undisrupted, but it didn’t. His phone kept on cutting in and out on us and eventually we gave up. I did, however get to talk to him for a good and fair amount of time. He told me that they were scheduled to leave the states on March 15th, but we still don’t know where he is going. I am sure by now he knows but as a security precaution he cannot tell me. I already know that once he gets over there they will assign him an APO address and that is all the information I need to know. Jesse told me that he would send me pictures of the sites from where ever he is at, that will be really neat to see.   Part of me is glad that the wait is finally over, I mean soon he will be over there and I can start counting the days, weeks and months that really count, but part of me is scared that he is going, and part of me doesn’t want to let him go. I know he will be ok, I mean I have been told that the group they are replacing didn’t have any casualties, and I am fairly confident that he knows how to handle himself in any given situation. I understand that he has to go because hundreds of thousand of soldiers are counting on them and need their services. Communications is important. But part of me can’t help but be selfish about the whole thing.  Yesterday Jesse told me that he  was going to send me a picture of Him and Carrie. I asked him who Carrie was and he told me it was his gun. He told me it is a tradition in the armed forces to name your firearm, and the first thing that came to his mind was Carrie. I asked him where he got that from and he said from Stephen King’s “Carrie”. That made me laugh. Any way I have taken up enough of your time with my babblings… ttyl!

        “Wonder” by Danielle Chidester    I wait in wonder  Of the days that lye ahead, And often search inside my heart, for explanations to things that were said.  All of the I love you’s, I’m sorry’s and such. All of these memories that have been touched, By your sweet soft lips, Your caressing hands,  and those looks I can’t resist.  But still I wait in wonder, All of those days you will be missed, Our solemn good byes and For the chance of that one special kiss.  I wait for those words, To be spoken from your lips, Don’t worry my dear, My time away will be quick, Before your heart will even began to break, I will be home once again with you.  & yet I wait in wonder.

       After a long week and a new decision to deal with my stress and anxiety in an alternative way, I guess I could say I am generally ok. I miss Jesse a lot and have decided that the only reason I am going to continue to be is to not break the promise I made to him before he left, He asked me to be here when he came home for good. I already can tell that this journey will be a long and very hard one for me to take and even though Jesse is facing a tougher future at least I know in my heart he has the strength to prevail in everything he does, he has the determination to drive himself. I on the other hand am not as strong as him and that is exactly why I admire Jesse. We haven’t had a chance to talk much this week and I have put myself in a state of panic over the whole deal. I know that eventually all I will have is my keyboard or good old fashion paper and pencil to guide us through our tough times, and the phone calls will probably be next to none once he gets overseas. I never expected to have to go through the things I have had to and more than ever I want Jesse home. I am terrified of what is to become of me. I had grown so comfortable of the simple things we had and now, in a matter of days, weeks and months, everything has become so much more complicated and a little too much for me to handle. I guess I finally found a downfall to falling in love with your best friend… you couldn’t always have them there when you need them. I am sure that eventually these feeling will pass and I hope that the time will fly by as well. I guess out of all of this I am just very curious as to how Jesse feels. I hope that this time apart will allow us to grow closer and to be more open when it comes to our feelings for the situation at hand and feelings about us. Our feelings can become our special secrets that we only share with ourselves and not with those around us, that is why they are our feelings.

       A surprise by all measures.  Today I got to work at 12:30 pm, Jesse had warned me earlier that he sent something to me at work but I didn’t really have any idea what to expect. I got a call not more than 5 minutes after I got to my supervisors desk, requesting that I come down to the 1st floor and pick up a package, mind you all that I am on the 25th floor of the building I work in. When I got to the 1st floor, I walked to security desk and My friend John was working there today (security for our building) He said that these, pointing to a cart with a beautiful white and red vase filled with huge bright red roses, were for me. They had been down there most of the morning and he had called my Voicemail and noted that I said I would not be in until 12:30 today. There was a card that read simply “I love you” and hand written underneath, “Thinking of you often, too bad it has to be this way. –Jesse”.  This little hand written line made me want to cry but at the same time I can’t seem to wipe the smile off my face.   The worst thing about it is that there is more on the way, I can only imagine what he has next for me.  * *Amazed at how much of a romantic Jesse is even when he is 4 States away.**

       Today is emotionally not a good day for me. I miss Jesse so much and I am beginning to doubt my effectiveness as a wife to him. I just feel so helpless at times; I mean I am supposed to be a good wife while he is away but what is there for me to do? I have no household to maintain and I don’t have a family to care for. Even though I moved back in with my mom I just feel like I have failed as a wife. All there is for me to do is sit and wait. I mean of course I need to live but besides school and work what is there?   I guess what I miss the most is waking up next to him. I remember the times when he would wake up long before me and just lay there looking at me. I would feel his eyes on me and slowly awaken. He would always say something like “Good morning beautiful” and that would make me smile the biggest smile ever. He always knew how to make me smile and forget whatever bothered me. I miss him so much that even though I look fine on the outside, my heart aches on the inside. I just feel so alone. I could be in a room filled with people, but none of them are really there to me.  I wonder if he feels the same way?

       This morning I finally got through to the people at AKO (ARMY Knowledge Online). They reset my password and I was able to log in and change it again. This time it is something simple enough for me to remember. I was very relieved to have finally get a hold of a live being, I was afraid I would have to listen to the “All operators are busy at this time, your call will be answered in the order in which it was received” & “please stay on the line, your patience is appreciated” for another ½ hour or so… I think I devoted an hour of my free time listening to those two messages. It just about drove me mad.   In other news, Jesse and I have attempted to talk every day online. Jesse thinks that this is the most stable means of communication, at least until he gets another number to call home on, the one he is using right now connects out of Germany and they time our calls, 15 minutes and no more. Also there is a delay on the phone and it gets a little annoying as well, but I can deal with the annoyance if it means I get to talk to Jesse.   Jesse sent me a picture of his current sleeping area and it seems small but Jesse assured me that it’s comfortable.    urlLink

       Last Friday was the most wonderful day ever. I had my first date in a long time, with Jesse of course. We met online when I cam home from work. On Yahoo Chat, we played a game of Chess and he beat me, he was always better at Chess then me. We then stopped a while, for Dinner break on my end, and a breakfast break on his end. Then later that night he logged in on a computer with a web cam and I got to see him for the first time since I left Texas. It has only been 2 ½ weeks, but it was so good to get to see his face. I logged on to my web cam and he got to see me as well. He told me that I was very beautiful and he was very happy to get to see me (I am not too sure why he felt I was so beautiful, my hair was messed up and I was in my pajamas). We had a really good talk about what we were going to do when he got home, if he had thought about coming home on leave, how he was doing, how I was doing, etc. I hope that we can do that again real soon. It is amazing to think of how much we have advanced in technology, that now when my husband is on the other side of the world, I can still see him.  In other news, AKO (ARMY Knowledge Online) has locked me out of my email account. I am not too sure why but hopefully someone will get back with an answer. I had to update my password the other day and now it isn’t letting me in to check my email. I called their help desk and was on hold for 45 minutes and gave up and sent an email to them instead. I am getting frustrated and hope that someone will get back to me soon.   I guess on the bright side of things my blog still works.

       Today I got to talk to Jesse off and on all day, through the miracle of modern technology and with the help of lovely yahoo messenger. It was as close to having Jesse home and next to me as I could get. Our conversations were like old times. All of the playful things he would say to me when he was here. It is good to know that he hasn’t changed much. I have also noticed that once he got to Kuwait, things seemed to be a little more at ease for him and when we talk I get to talk to my husband and not the soldier, which I like. It is sort of like having him away on a trip and sometimes, rarely, it almost feels like  he is just away on a camping trip and not assigned to Kuwait as part of the Military support for Operation Iraqi Freedom.   I do hate that he is gone, but I feel deep down in my heart that everything will be ok. I don’t feel panic and anxiety of him being over there. I just hope that my intuition is accurate and nothing is going to happen to him.  I am sure everything will be fine.

       Last night I got to talk to Jesse. We had a great talk but it was ended sooner than anticipated. I had no idea that their phone calls were being times. This brings up the interesting question of whether or not their phone calls are being listened in on as well? I was a little upset that I wasn’t able to say good-bye and I love you to Jesse. I miss him and I guess I am going to have to plan our phone calls a little better from now on and only talk about important things and make sure to start every conversation with my I love you’s and such, just in case our calls get disconnected abruptly. I guess this whole thing is going to take some time getting used to. He is my husband; I shouldn’t have to follow rules and regulations to be able to speak with him. It’s just silly, or at least I think so.   Last night I had a dream. I was at this store looking at new clothes and trying them on for Jesse. It felt so real. I could hear his voice telling me that I looked beautiful. It made me feel good to hear that again. The rest of the details to my dream are blurred but that fact stuck out the most.   I guess one of the things I miss about having Jesse home, is hearing him say how beautiful I am to him. Kuwait is just so far away to begin with. It doesn’t help when you are missing the person who is there.  I am sure the time will go by quick enough, but any time away from Jesse just plain sucks.

       Today I saw my first pictures of Kuwait. They had been posted on the FSG yahoo group site. It was a little strange to see them. I sort of went into shock when I saw them. All you could see was sand and tents, sand and more tents. It was a little scary to think that his was all they had to protect them from the elements. I can’t really say how seeing these pictures made me feel. I just got this strange feeling over me when I saw them, like I was expecting a little more for our troops. It is just so surreal sometimes. The only comforting thing was that one of the pictures had her husband in it. He had a big smile. Underneath all of that dirt and dessert camouflage there was a smile. I can only pray that our guys are ok. I know that they should be fine, but something in my head keeps saying, you never know… I wish that Jesse would call home soon, just so I knew he was ok.

        "Blanket over my eyes" by Danielle Chidester written 3/23/2004   I close my eyes. The world as I know it has been consumed by a thick orangey-black blanket. I can still hear the noise of the world around me, All of the hustle and bustle All of the screaming and cursing The cars, horns, The people mumbling to themselves. Someone trying to peddle cash from unsuspecting passer bys.  I can hear all of the one sided conversation, of the cell phone users… abusers.  I hear the clink, clink, clink, of bicycle wheels turning round and round. I hear the squeak of the breaks, of an approaching bus, the rumble of thunderous footsteps.   I open my eyes, the blanket of orangey-black  is removed from my eyes  and look around. I see and hear nothing, I am all alone.  So I put on my headphones and walk away. Listening to the sounds of my own world.

       I wish I had stayed in bed today. I don’t really know why but for some reason I have this feeling of being worn down. I am not too sure if this is because of me being sick or what. I have a picture of my Nana in my cubicle at work. I find that I avoid looking at it sometimes; I guess it makes me sad to see her. She is so beautiful and God got him a wonderful angel when we lost her.    Here is a picture of my Nana (Grandma) and Nanu (Grandpa) and all of their children (my Aunts and Uncles). My Mom is the pretty lady on the left in the white with pink flower sweater. My Nana is the bright smiling lady, in the light blue dress, in the middle)  I miss my Nana a lot and I know she is felling better now but it just wasn’t her time yet.     My throat still hurts a lot and I am still coughing. I wish this would all just go away. I haven’t talked to Jesse in a few days but my new philosophy is no news is good news. I would still like to talk to him but I am sure he is very tired and very busy. I know that the days are warming up in Kuwait and with all of those layers from the uniforms on they must be hot and uncomfortable. I miss my soldier. I wish I could see him for 5 minutes, just so I knew he was ok. I haven’t heard much from his mom, but I wonder if she even realizes that her son is in Kuwait and not in America any more. I hate calling her to talk, she makes me so uncomfortable sometimes. Jesse knows I hate talking to her, heck I think he dislikes talking to her too. It is sad, I sort of wish they had a better relationship, I wish she would show some sign of caring for her son. I guess that is how some people deal with things.  Any way, I am crossing my fingers in hope that I get a call from my Loverly Hubby Bear (I am sure he will smack me for that one).   TTYL!

       Today was the first day back to the way life was before I went to see Jesse in Texas. All that is left from my sickness is a lingering cough and a hint of laryngitis. Jesse has call twice since arriving in Kuwait. He told me that they were going to move him to a camp up north, but still in Kuwait. I worry about him, as I should, but not as much knowing that he is in Kuwait and not in Iraq. I am getting ready to send him the first hand written letter; sort of a test to see how long a letter takes to get to him. I am not even sure id postage is different when sending packages and letters to APO addresses. I think about him every second of my day and anxiously await his next phone call home. Jesse sounded really good when I talked to him. He told me that when he got to the new camp that he would see if they would place him on a night shift so that he can be awake when I am awake and we could talk more. I told him if he could do that it would be great. David got moved to another camp away from Jesse. Jesse said that David was not happy about this but the fact of the matter is that the decision to send him south was decided on partly because they wanted him to be in a safer location (with Abigail (his 4 month old daughter) in mind). I continue to pray for Jesse and David every night and hope that they, and all of the members of the 319th, will remain safe during their stay in the Middle East.  I am doing a little better… I am adjusting to all that has happened to me as well as can be expected, after the last 2 weeks, having to say goodbye to my Husband and dealing with the wrongful death of my Nana (Grandma), and after all of that, getting a viral infection that caused me to have to take another week off from school and work. I knew upon receiving the news of Jesse’s deployment that our lives were going to be changed… but I can safely say that I never saw this coming. I can only hope that the president sends our boys and girls home sooner than expected, or that this year will go by fast.

       A lot has happened since I last posted. When I returned home I found out some bad news, my Grandmother passed away. I had to send a message to Jesse through our FSG Liason SPC Kingsley, and have him send a message to someone on Jesse's end and give him the message. I hated having to give him the news that way but it was the only way I knew how. Two days later Jesse left the states. His official 1st Day was Sunday March 14th so start counting the days.  I had a great visit with him in Texas and almost wish it never had ended. I got a really nice picture of Jesse in his uniform, without firearm, and we had a great time being together and going out to dinner, and several other meals, with Danielle, David and Abigail Barber. I haven’t heard from Jesse since last Thursday, but that is to be expected since they are now in a new time-zone and are eleven hours ahead of us. He is going to be stationed somewhere in Kuwait. All I can do is wait for his call. in the meantime, I also manage to get sick as well, so once I was raring to go back to work and school I managed to catch something and have been home ever since. My bosses seem to be understanding and told me not to rush a return... but I guess it all takes time, any way....  ....I wrote a poem today:  How much more can I take? What am I supposed to do? When things happen like they have… Who can I turn too? When I cry at night,  My pillow holds the tears. When I need to scream and shout, Who will listen to my fears? I know I am not alone, My family and friends are here,  But it’s my Husband who I miss,  It’s him who wipes my tears. He takes away my fears,  And holds me close and tight. It’s him I want, not a damp pillow, To hold close to me at night.

       This week has gone by so fast. I will be flying back home in one day and I hate the idea of having to say goodbye again. I guess I will do what I did last time and wish Jesse good luck and tell him I will be waiting for him to come home. Yesterday we took a long drive to White Sands New Mexico to visit the White Sand Dunes. It was very beautiful. We went on a sunset tour of a Dune Basin and just around sunset we walked to a nice dune and watched to sun set behind a great wall of mountains. We also purchased a disk and took a few slides down the side of a steep Dune. I am pretty sure I got a picture of David doing this. It was very fun. I took some amazing pictures and will post a few of them. I am not to sure what we are going to do today but I figure whatever the venture, we will make the best of it. I have come to realize that every day you get to spend with a loved one is the greatest gift anyone can ask for.

       Today is my first full day in Texas. We went to Dona Ana. We got to tour the barracks where Jesse and David were slipping in. I took a picture of the barrack and some nice mountain ranges along the way. The flight yesterday was ok, but for some reason I got sick to my stomach on the flight out of Sacramento. Danielle and I were very happy to finally get off the the planes and onto solid ground. When we got to Texas Jesse and David surprised us. Jesse almost knocked me off my feet, he startled me. I was so happy to see him and all I could do is hug and kiss him. God, I miss him. I am glad I got the oportunity to fly out here and see him before he goes overseas.

       I can’t wait. In less than 2 days I will be in Texas on my way to seeing Jesse. I am so excited. I haven’t seen him since Christmas, and even then we were both very sick so our visit wasn’t really one of the best we could have had. I haven’t really talked to Jesse much but with his phone acting up that can be expected. They ran a really interesting article in the local paper on Sunday about the 319th and some training they have been undergoing to help them be better prepared for a convoy attack, if you have been listening to the news lately that is all they have really been talking about (Convoy attacks). I am very relieved that the ARMY is taking the time to train our soldiers on this because they have admitted to sending the first group over there unprepared. The article was a big slap in the face for me. I also got a chance to see a really interesting documentary call “True Life” which airs on MTV. I watched an episode, which happened to be titled, “My Life in Iraq” which followed a soldier and a few residents of Kuwait.  I have never watched this show so naturally curiosity got the best of me and I watched it. It was really interesting to see the views that were portrayed and to get a few insights as to how soldiers are dealing with being over there. Unfortunately this show portrays a different topic an episode but who knows maybe they will rerun that episode, so I can tape it. I think if they continue to runs episodes based in Iraq people would watch, I know I would.

       I am so tired today. All I want to do is go home and go to sleep.  I miss Jesse a lot today and all I really want is for him to be home. I miss hearing his voice and seeing him and holding him and kissing and loving him. I miss everything about him. I miss coming home and finding him glued to the computer, or asleep on the couch. I miss eating meals with him and walking to Rite-Aid with him. I miss riding our bikes to the grocery store and having to cart all of our grocery’s home. I miss sleeping on the couch with him next to me. I miss soaking in the bathtub with him sitting next to the tub, just talking to me. I miss our little barbeques and how when we were in our bed, how my cat would try to sleep between us. I miss playing video games with him, or just even watching Dune for the umpteen times and me falling asleep halfway through it. I miss our walk by the riverfront and having Jesse behind me holding me nice and tight.   I know if I had more time to think, or just the energy to think, I would probably be able to come up with a millions different things I miss about Jesse, but for some reason I am really tired right now.

       Last night I did get to talk to Jesse for a little bit, that was until he realized what time it was here and told me to go to bed because it was late. Its funny how he tries to look after me even from on the other side of the world. I told him about how my hand was killing me and that I made an appointment with my Doctor for Monday. I told him that I would let him know if the Doctor suggests surgery or not.   I also told Jesse that I have been worrying about him a lot, usually when I have nothing to do, which is real funny because, I always have something to do, yet I always find the time to worry about him. I just miss him so much. Saturday is our nephew Isaac’s 5th Birthday. Jesse wont get to be home for this one but I hope am going to attempt to take the video camera there and see if I can video tape some of it for him. I plan to go get the capture card for the computer soon and have my brother install it for me then I can hook the camera into the computer and record the video on a CD for Jesse to see. It will be cool. Jesse has given me a few ideas of ones to get but told me hands down to buy it from Circuit City, because they have the best prices I guess. It wont be the best quality video but its better than nothing and this way he can see how our niece and nephews look now and see some home video of family events.   I miss him a lot.

        ”One Day” Written by Danielle Chidester 4/29/2004   I have seen a lot in my time, Walk to heaven and back, Saw a grown woman cry, But never have I held a life in my hands, That feeling I don’t understand.  Sure I have held my sisters’ kids, Or my cousins’ kids, Hell, even my best friends’ kid, But I have never held a life in my hands. That feeling I don’t understand.  I wonder what its like, To hold a little life, To shelter a little soul, That was made from love. How this little miracle will feel When it first looks at me.  But I have never held a life in my hands. That feeling I don’t understand.  …. One day….

       Today, like any other day, I miss Jesse.  My carpal Tunnel is acting up but there really isn't anything I can do about it. I made a doctors appointment for next Monday and I am going to talk with my new Doctor about it. He may have to refer me to someone else, and they my suggest surgery. I have wanted to talk to Jesse about this. The thought of surgery scares me and I would make someone go with me. I just Jesse was home to talk to me and make me feel better about the whole thing.   Because of Jesse's new shifts I haven't talked to hime much... It makes it very hard for me when I need to make a decision like surgery.

       I decided to search through my former blog and dig up a poem I wrote sometime last summer. I felt that it was pretty good and I wanted to share it with whomever happened to read this thing I created. Here it is:    Watching Through Windows       I am watching through these windows and wondering why they are here,     Wondering if you can see the true me from the other side.      I see many people passing by,     They stare at me as if I am the different one,     When all of them have secrets of their own.      I am a wife, a sister, and a daughter,     I have friends from many walks of life,     I am overweight and scared to be alone.     I am a Aunt and someone cousin,     Most of my friends are gay,     Yet I don’t see that, because they are my friends.      I love my Family.     My Friends are also my family.      I watch through these windows and I see my neighbor,     He is usually quite, but I know he drinks a lot.     He probably has many demons,     I see a girl a crossed the street,     Waiting, waiting, waiting… but for whom?      I hear the voices of men, these men I never see but always hear.     Their voices come from a cross the street, I wonder if they ever work     It seems as if they are always sitting out there,     Hiding in the shadows.      I see homeless men walk to the corner store and return     With a bottle in a paper bag,     I wonder why they do this to themselves,     Why?      I wonder if all of the things I see are true to the people I see on the other side of the window,     And if so I wonder what they think of me?

        "Ignorant Bliss" by Danielle Chidester 4/27/2004   You don’t see me, You see through me.  You don’t hear me Over the noise in your head.  The sun is shinning But all you seem to see are clouds. How can ignorance  Be the plan  The flowers are now blooming But dead steams are all you crush I try to reach for heaven But its hell you seem to touch  The sun is shinning But all you seem to see are clouds. How can ignorance  Be the plan  A playground where children once played Is now ground covered in glass All of our childhood memories Have been discarded in the trash  The sun is shinning But all you seem to see are clouds. How can ignorance  Be the plan  Ignorance is bliss Ignorance is bliss Ignorance is bliss But blissful people are  truly ignorant

       So this tells you how effective messenger is as a form of communication. I just I misunderstood what Jesse was trying to tell me regarding his new work arrangement. He is not going to have to do both guard duty and helpdesk during one shift, apparently they are alternating shifts, one shift guard duty and one shift help desk and so forth. He didn’t seem to happy regarding this decision and is even more unhappy with the fact that the shifts include only one person, Jesse told me that you need to have at least two people per shift. I haven’t really spoken with him these last few days but I know her is ok. He is still unhappy with the current situation but then again I thank god for every day he is safe and not in Iraq. I can only hope that the ARMY doesn’t get the brilliant idea to relocate the 319th.   Today I was thinking about how now Jesse is talking about coming home on leave in September or sometime after. I wish that they hadn’t screwed up on his request; it would have been so nice to have him home for two weeks in the summer sometimes I wonder if the ARMY is really about family, or if they are just selfish and only think about what would be good for their staffing and what would be good for the camps that our soldiers are stationed at.   To tell you the truth I think I have thought more about the ARMY in the last five months then I have had to in the entire time Jesse has been in the ARMY reserves.

       Today, like any other day, went by very slow. I had the whole day to myself, which was a first, and all I could think about was being with Jesse. I got to talk to Jesse via the internet and even talked him into calling home. We had a great time talking and I was very sad when our conversations ended but I do know that was can’t always talk for the whole day nonstop.   I also found out today that the ARMY screwed up on Jesse’s leave request. He looked a schedule of all leave requests up to the end of September, and he couldn’t find his name on it. He said he would look into it and see what can be done. They also made some changes at the camp Jesse is station at and move one of the other companies out and a new one in. Jesse said they were all used to a set routine and this new company wants to change everything around and the plans they have aren’t even logical. Jesse’s job for the ARMY is to troubleshoot the computer/networks/satellites and such, this other company wants him to do his job and be on guard duty at the same time, the catch is that his has to be on guard and troubleshoot solo (one man shifts). When he told me this all I could think of is how this plan won’t work. All I could do was tell Jesse to give it time, the other company will eventually see that this won’t work and try something new. All he can do is wait it out and hopefully everything will get back to working order. It really has to be frustrating to have to deal with what he has too; I know I couldn’t do it.    In other news, one of Jesse and Mine close family friends is finally coming home from his service overseas, but he wasn’t serving in Kuwait or Iraq, he was stationed in Korea. He is due to come home Wednesday. I am so happy that I finally get to see him after all this time. I am so stoked. We have a lot to catch up on, too much time has gone by.  I guess if I can’t have my husband home, one of our close family friends will do.  Its funny how things tend to work themselves out.

       It is two days past my one-year wedding anniversary. Now that I look back on it I am very grateful that I have my family here with me. I de-thawed my wedding cake and to my surprise it really didn’t taste that bad. I took two smaller pieces and froze them in a separate box and wrapped it up very tight (I am going to attempt to send it to Jesse). I miss him a lot. I know that that is a common theme in all of my postings but if I told you otherwise I wouldn’t be telling you the truth. It is very hard when your best friend is far away from you. Jesse is my best friend. As I sit here today, I find myself only being able to think of how wonderful it would be if Jesse were home. I thought that if I packed up my life into a cold dark storage unit that I could deal with the separation a bit better, but that is not the truth, even when all of his things are neatly packed away, I am still surrounded by things that remind me of him. It is very hard. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to forget about him all together but at the same time I don’t want to have that constant reminder that he is in Kuwait and not at home.   He has been gone since November 29th (He came home for 4 days in December) then I went to see him for 6 days in March, before he left for Kuwait. I think he has been gone long enough and now it is time for him to come home. I know that this isn’t going to happen and still for some reason there is a little bit of hope inside of me wishing that he was on his way home.   I just miss my best friend, my husband.

       Today is our wedding anniversary. I really wish that Jesse were home today. I miss him and for some reason today sucks more then the rest of the days I have had to go through without him. He has been overseas for a month and a half and hasn’t been home since Christmas. It has just been too long for him to be gone. Today we decided to meet online for an afternoon, for me, very late evening, for him, date. It is so wonderful to be able to talk to him online, I seriously advise anyone in my situation to find out a working schedule of times to communicate with your loved one overseas via messenger services (Yahoo, MSN, AOL IM, etc.) It does help the days go by a little smoother.   Jesse told me that he got my box. I am so glad it got to him ok. I was worried. He said that the coffee I sent (two ½ pound bags of freshly ground Starbucks Coffee) smelled so good and the cookies (I baked M&M cookies) were delicious and to send more. This made my day. I am so glad that he got it and everything was fine. I can start on box number two now. Maybe this time I will bake him some special cookies.   This day started out so awful, but having Jesse to talk to while at work is helping lift my mood up. He always knows how to make me smile, even from ½ way across the world.

       What a long day.  I find that the later in the week the longer my days feel.  Tomorrow I start my first Saturday class.  It is from 9:00 am to 2:30 pm.  The course in on Family Childcare and I have been looking forward to this class all semester.  In other news, I continue to chat with Jesse just about every day.  I found out that my phone, which has wireless internet, can log into yahoo messenger so if I am in route from point A to point B I can always log in there and talk to him through my phone.  It is really a neat thing the thing they call technology.  :-)   Monday is Jesse and Mine 1 year wedding anniversary.  I am not really looking forward to it.  I was hoping that I could just not wake up, but that wont happen.  Jesse said that he would call me; I think we need to talk to each other on our day.  I really hate that he has to be away on our anniversary but I know that he is needed where he is.  He and the rest of his unit are very important to the war effort, and I know that.  Every so often the selfishness peeks through and shows its ugly little face, and I guess today is one of those days.  I just miss him more with each passing day, sometimes I wish I could pinch myself and all of this would just go away like a bad dream, but all I wind up with is a sore spot on my arm and the realization that my bad dream is real life.  I just always hate missing my best friend, especially when he is ½ way across the world.

       A lot has happened since the last time I posted. Last night I went out with Jessica Weldon and a Friend of hers (Keith) My Friend Dale meet up with us as well. We stayed out until Close to Midnight. I had a lot of fun. One thing that did bother me about the night was that Jessica had 3worried me regarding the possibility of Jesse enlisting as full time Active duty. I went to bed with that on my mind. This morning I got a call from Dale’s Ex, Paul (also my friend) asking me if it was true. I told him that I hadn’t talked to Jesse otherwise but I was pretty sure that it wasn’t. When I got into work I logged into Yahoo messenger and waited for Jesse to come online, start his shift. He came on around 11:00, right about when I got to work. We talked a bit and I asked him about what Weldon had said. Jesse responded with a “F**K NO!” This made me feel a lot better. I knew that Jesse would never do that, but part of me wondered why I doubted him in the first place. I know he would talk to me before making a decision that would affect both of our lives.   Jesse and I had a wonderful talk online today. I surprised him a little though. I told him “I have always been honest with you. I have never lied or cheated or even thought about cheating or lying. You have managed to capture my heart and soul from the first time I saw you for who you really were. I don't think I have ever meet anyone in my whole life who has ever done that for me.” I think when I told him that he was surprised a bit. I asked him if he would call me because I missed hearing his voice and sure enough he did. It was so wonderful hearing him talk to me. He asked me how come I never told him how I felt and I explained to him that spoken words don’t come to me that easily. I think a lot clearer now that I am on Lexapro, my thoughts are a lot clearer to me.  I can’t wait until Jesse gets to come home. I know things are going to be a little weird at first but I love him more than anything I can imagine so I know it will all work out in the end.

       Six days until our One Year wedding Anniversary. I can’t believe that it has been one year already. Four months of that year have been spent apart.  This shouldn’t be allowed. I find that I miss Jesse a lot more as the days melt away one by one. It is hard for me to wake up and start my day without him by my side. Instead of homesick, I am sick for Jesse.  Yesterday when I came home from work I found a big heaping stack of mail for me.  The one thing that caught my eyes first was a large USPS envelope with Jesse’s handwriting all over it. I less than carefully opened the envelope and pulled out a nicely folded plastic airport bag and laughed to myself. I opened the bag and pulled out a small stack of things he had placed in it. There were two postcards from Ireland, and Iron on Patch from Ireland as well, but the one thing that caught my eyes was a small silver necklace with the Claddagh symbol on it. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  The Claddagh symbolizes the trinity of "Love, Loyalty, and Friendship" and has been the base of our relationship since well before our wedding day. Both Jesse and I have Irish in our background so we felt that it would be appropriate to choose this symbol as a representation of our relationship with one another. Jesse, If you read this, please know that I love you more than anything you could imagine and I absolutely love the gift.   urlLink     To read a little more about the Claddagh please visit   urlLink Claddagh Story

       Today I have had this song running through my head all day. This song is our song. Today I find that I miss him so much and I guess all I can do is remember all of the good things. I have found that today my mind has wandered as far back as our first date, to the events that lead to our first date, and everything up to today. I find that little things tend to remind me of Jesse. I just wish that this month goes by just as fast as the last four have.   Nothing Else Matters ~ Metallica/Black Album   So close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters  never opened myself this way life is ours, we live it our way all these words I don't just say and nothing else matters  trust I seek and I find in you every day for us something new open mind for a different view and nothing else matters  never cared for what they do never cared for what they know but I know  so close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are and nothing else matters  never cared for what they do never cared for what they know but I know  never opened myself this way life is ours, we live it our way all these words I don't just say and nothing else matters  trust I seek and I find in you every day for us something new open mind for a different view and nothing else matters  never cared for what they say never cared for games they play never cared for what they do never cared for what they know and I know  so close no matter how far couldn't be much more from the heart forever trusting who we are no nothing else matters

         My charm bracelet   Below you will see a picture of my Italian Charm Bracelet. I started this venture about one week prior to going to Texas and seeing Jesse before he shipped off. I was very surprised at how addicting this little thing could be. I have already collect a few for the war effort and some for me and some for Jesse.

       Today with Danielle and Abigail was wonderful. I really like hainging out with her, she is such a great girl and that baby is so cute. Danielle kept on saying to me that I would make a wonderful mother. That made me feel good. I just feel so natural with kids. Hearing that from her just made me with that I had a baby of my own. We had been talking about starting a family, it would be nice. Jesse and I will have been married for one year April 19th. I can remember our wedding day like it was yesterday, the "I do's" are fresh in my mind.   Wow, one year.   Jesse is trying to get to come home in the summer for leave. that would be the most wonderful thing if he could come home.  We are shooting for sometime around the 4th of July and my birthday. Jesse said when he gets to come home we will try again to conceive. I am a little scared but at the same time I am ready. Oh well only time will tell.

       Today I did something I have never done before. I worked on my taxes. I know what you all must be thinking, but come on, Jesse was the tax man of the household… and now that he isn’t home, I have to do all of the things he did for our household. Well any way… all id good otherwise. I still miss Jesse like mad, but then again who wouldn’t miss him, he is a wonderful guy to be around. I guess I miss having intellectual conversations with people, sometimes. I am not saying that everyone I talk to is not smart, most of them are very intelligent, however no one speaks to me like Jesse does, no one understands where I am coming from. I just hate missing my best friend.

       Today was very stressing. I went to a baby shower for one of my cousins today. Everyone who was there that knew about Jesse asked how he was doing. After you hear this enough it starts getting to you. I know that thye mean well but I have had a lot on my mind these past few days and sometimes it doesn't help me much to be reminded of all of the things that make me sad, like being separated from Jesse. I also came to realize that I don't care for family gatherings much any more and it is always so much more fun when Jesse is around. Next weekened is easter and the family has been invited to my Nanu's house for a easter lunch. I don't know if I really want to go, but I know that if I don't I will regret not going to see my Nanu. Most likely I will put on a happy face and go. I know that even if I do go, Jesse will be on my mind the whole time, he always is. I didn't get a chance to talk to him today but I am hoping he calls home in the morning. It would be so nice to hear his voice again.  28 days down..... to many more left to go, and 16 days till our 1 year wedding aniversary.

       So far this week Jesse and I have been chatting online through AKO chat. It seems to be the most stable of platforms for chat, and the only one that doesn’t disconnect Jesse. Things have been going as well as can be expected and there really isn’t too much to report back. I have adjusted very well to not having Jesse home, but I think part of that has to do with the fact that I have my mom and her boyfriend to keep me company, and very busy for that matter. Still it is very neat to be able to talk to Jesse via Internet chat, beings that those before us probably didn’t have that capability.   It has been 2 weeks since my Nana has passed and I can remember it like it was yesterday. I can still see the look on my mom’s face when I walked through the door. I can still see the shell of a body left behind in place of my Nana. I know that this will take quite a long time to adjust too, but it is also very hard to as well. Like some things, I wish I could just put it all behind me and move on.  But with the discussion of a life lost, a new life is about to be added to my already large family. My cousin Bernadette is expecting a little one at the end of May. This weekend is her baby shower. I just love baby showers! My mom and I made really cute party favors and decorated little basket bassinets to but them in. I bought her 2 Cute as can be baby outfits and just can’t wait until Saturday, when the party is. I love babies in general and can’t wait until I am able to have a baby shower of my own.

       I find as it nears 10:00 pm Monday evening that my weekend has been both tiring and yet one that I don’t really care to have end. I find that I am reluctant to close my eyes and put my self to rest because I know that I will have to wake in the morning and venture to another slow day at work when I would much rather be home sleeping my morning away.   I had many a trying events this weekend and although there were three separate days it really just felt like one long one. Today we had a Barbeque for Memorial Day. A few members of my family were here and it was so nice to see them all. I think today was the first day I really didn’t think much of Jesse, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I didn‘t really get the opportunity to think about him over all of the screaming  from my niece and nephews and the loud chit chat of a few of my Aunt’s gossiping. This morning I went to a special Mass at the cemetery that my Nana is buried in. It was a very nice service and afterwards we went to pay our respects to my Nana. I also asked my Nanu if it would be alright to take a picture of her plot to send to Jesse through email. He gave me the ok and I took two. Jesse hasn’t seen it yet but I will make it a point to email it to him very soon. I feel it is very important for him to see that we are taking good care of her and maybe when he comes home for leave he can go with me to see her and take her flowers. I told Jesse that I knew he would be ok there in Kuwait because deep down inside I believe that my Nana is now an angle for God and she is watching over him and will make sure no one harms him in any manner.  Today, although very busy, made me remember that I am very thankful for all of the service members past and present and what they did for the U.S. as well as remembering those who stayed behind at home and took care of their families.   Somewhere I read that the toughest job in the military is that of a military spouse. That is always something important to consider.

       Well nothing very exciting happened today. I did what every normal wife does on a Saturday, I cleaned. My mom is going to host a small family get-together on Monday for Memorial Day. I think this is the first time we have ever celebrated it. It will be nice to have the family all here and it is a great opportunity to take pictures of everyone to send to Jesse. My Niece and two Nephews are also coming over and I know any pictures of them Jesse would love to see.   I am also working on a special project to send Jesse, but I can’t say what it is because I know he reads this and I want him to be very surprised (if anyone wants to know please don’t hesitate to ask me via email). I got the idea for my top secret project from one of the other ladies in my FRG and today I went to Wal-Mart to get the supplies. Don’t worry when I am done I will post pictures up of my top-secret project here.

       Communications have been slim with Jesse these last few days. I waited up until 11:30 last night to see if he would be online, just to tell him I love him and to say hi, but he never came on. They are always changing his schedule around so he really can’t give me a definite work schedule. I never know when his days off are until after they happen. I just have to keep telling myself that all of this is petty, he is safe and that’s all I should be concerned about.   I guess partly I am bothered by the fact that he isn’t home when bad things happen to me. I have to say I contribute my being sick forever to the fact that my immune system is probably low because of me being sad or upset about him being gone. I know it sounds funny but emotional stress can affect your health.  Other than that I am doing ok. I am still suffering from the allergy monster (please note he has graduated from bug to monster over the course of one day) and I find that it takes great skill to consume a meal when you cant breath through your nose.   If I keep blowing my nose the way I have, Jesse should have no problem finding me, all he would have to do is look for the red glow that has developed from the constant blowing.  And on top of all that, my cat bit my finger this morning and broke skin (Don’t ask- if you really want to know just email me it’s wussamattayu@yahoo.com, please put cat bite in the subject line) so now I am typing with a handicap.  I guess if Jesse happens to read this just know that I haven’t broken anything yet, and I do still have all ten fingers and nine… oops ten toes.  :-)  Its so nice to have a sense of humor about these types of things.

       This week has been so slow at work but I guess I can’t complain since it has given me more time to write in my blog. After surviving a weird viral throat infection and getting food poisoning I am less than happy to announce that the seasonal allergy bug has decided to move in and take over and just when I thought nothing else could go wrong too. Other than that things remain the same for me. I wake up each morning and got to work, when it slow at work or when I am home I make it a point to log on to the Internet too see if Jesse is online and that’s my life in a nutshell (Pretty boring, if I do say so myself).  In other news, the FRG has decided to have a meeting next week to propose a reelection of group officers because there is a lot of people who are not happy with that is going on with the group, although that is not the reason they gave us. :-)  They actually stated the positions that were filled were only temporary positions and now is the time to reelect people we feel are suited for the job. I wasn’t able to attend the last meeting but I have spoken with a few people in our group afterwards and understand why this has been brought to the groups attention and feel that it is a good idea to hold an election.   I think this is a good move for the FRG and something that needed to be done a while ago. It also gives the people who want to be involved a chance to be part of the process.  If the ARMY can’t be organized then at least the FRG should be.

       Todays short little rant:   Damn it , they changed his shifts again. I don’t understand why they have to do these rotations. Once again Jesse and I are going to be working opposite schedules, he is working when I am not and vise versa. He said he would try to get online a little earlier so we would be able to chat around 8:00 pm tonight. I just wish that they would quit switching his schedule around so much. Just when I get used to it they throw me off by switching his working time.   I guess it would be too much to ask the ARMY to stay consistent with their decision.

       What a day. Nothing really exciting has happened at all today and I seriously doubt anything of grave importance will. I have been talking to Jesse off and on all day, just the normal chitchat we would usually have if he were here. I have been having my sleeping issues again but I think not having Jesse home contributes to the tossing and turning.   The topic for the week, mind you its only Tuesday, has been what will our kids be and look like. Yesterday I found the cutest onesie with Sponge Bob Square Pants and Metallica (can be viewed here:  urlLink http://www.hottopic.com/store/product.asp?LS=0&ITEM=862370&RN=343 ) on it. Jesse and I were talking about how it’s a pity that we don’t have a little ones to dress up in it. Jesse doesn’t know about this (but if he happens to read this entry he will) but Angela gave me 2 plastic bins filled with Baby Girl Clothing. I looked through it and just fell in love with the idea of having a little one to dress up in little dresses and hats and teeny tiny shoes. I know there is more to having children than dressing them up, I know about the feeding, cleaning, changing, doctor appointments and such. In fact I am probably over prepared to start a family, after all I am an ECE Student.  I told Jesse a few days back that I was very confident that he was going to be a great father. I know he would love, care and provide for his kids and would do whatever it would take to make sure that they had everything they needed and at the same time he would make sure our needs were being met too.   I am very confident that we are going to be good parents.   Why, when we are hundreds of miles apart, do we decide to start a family?

        I am not a big fan of country music but I have to say this song touched me. A Soldier (who has asked that I not call him by name) said this song was him and his wifes song and he felt I should listen to it.   Artist: Toby Keith  Album: Shock'n Y' all  Song: American Soldier   I'm just trying to be a father, Raise a daughter and a son, Be a lover to their mother, Everything to everyone. Up and at 'em bright and early, I'm all in my business suit, Yeah, I'm dressed for success from my head down to my boots, I don't do it for money, there's still bills that I can't pay, I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway, Providing for our future's my responsibility, Yeah I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be, And I can't call in sick on Mondays when the weekends been to strong, I just work straight through the holidays, And sometimes all night long. You can bet that I stand ready when the wolf growls at the door, Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady, hey I'm true down to the core, And I will always do my duty, no matter what the price, I've counted up the cost, I know the sacrafice, Oh, and I don't want to die for you, But if dyin's asked of me, I'll bear that cross with an honor, 'Cause freedom don't come free. I'm an american soldier, an american, Beside my brothers and my sisters I will proudly take a stand, When liberty's in jeopardy I will always do what's right, I'm out here on the front lines, sleep in peace tonight. American soldier, I'm an American, An American, An American Soldier

       I still can’t believe that I cried because of Styx, what is wrong with me?  I had a wonderful time in class today. I felt my project was a hit, now the tough part waiting for the grades to get posted. I am sure I did fine but I still can’t help but worry about how I did.  Well in a few days we should know.   I have to pass both classes because if I don’t I will be fired from work. I am on probation through my employer and even though being fired due to academic standings is silly, it still means being fired and I have never been fired from   any   job I have ever had.  Other than that, I am doing quite well. I am going to get to see Jesse and mines friend Ronnie for the first time in forever, but in two weeks. I can’t wait. It will be so good to be able to see him again. I have missed him. Remember he was the one who was stationed in Korea and finally came home a few weeks back.   I am also looking forward to summer break which will give me a chance to save up some money and work on becoming Debt free. Yippy. Then back to school again. I am looking forward to going back too. I am 3 units away from completing my Associate Degree in Fine Arts and Jesse might actually be able to be home for my Graduation Ceremony which is what I want the most, for him to be in the crowd cheering me on when I get my degree.  I so can’t believe how wonderful things have been turning out given the circumstances.  It sure is funny how life works sometimes.

       I had quite the weekend. I really don’t remember what was done for Saturday other than I cleaned house most of the day. Sunday I went out with a friend of Jesse and me and his ex, also a friend of ours and his hopeful of a boyfriend (trust me as I am here typing this it does make perfectly good sense). I spent most of the day listening to the other one talk about the other one and so forth. After a while I just sort of toned it out. Around 3:30 in the afternoon or for all of you army time people… 15:30… did I get that right?  Any way, my big Brother and my friend/his girlfriend Candace came to pick me up and we were off to go see a semi-free concert… long story. It was Styx with headliner Peter Frampton and opening act Nelson (ewwe :-P). Peter Frampton was good (and I have to say he is an awesome guitar player) and the show Styx put on was very entertaining. I don’t really listen to this kind of music but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see any concert from 24 rows from stage for $4.00 a ticket, could you? Any way the concert was very good. Styx did a song, but I can’t remember the name of it, but they did a dedication to all of the service members. It made me cry to say the least. But deep down inside I know I really needed too.   I just can’t get over the fact that I cried because of Styx.   Well today is my last final for the spring 2004 Semester. I get to demonstrate how to make a “Magnifying Waterscope” It’s pretty cool. So today is it for this semester then it off for 3 months for summer break and then back to school for my first full-term semester in a very long time. I can’t wait. I have always preferred school over work.   Today I feel very sick to my stomach though. I ate at a restaurant yesterday called Annabell’s and for the First time ever I think I have food poisoning. I feel so nauseated. Usually Annabell’s has good food.

       As I sit here eating my red vines and drinking my first Mountain Dew since Jesse left home I think about what exactly our master plan is in life. I wonder if there was a way to know what destiny has in store for me would I even want to know. I am reminded of a scene in the movie Big Fish where the main character is telling a story about when he was a little boy. How he walked up to an old lady that was believed to have been a witch. She possessed the power to show you how you were going to die just by looking into her patched eye. The little boy looked into her eye and sure enough saw how he was going to die. I don’t think I would want to know how I was going to die because I would probably waste the rest of my life trying to stop the inevitable, so to speak.   One of my favorite Motto’s (Jesse told me this once and they are words to live by) is “For every reality there are infinite possibilities”. These are words to live by. That goes along the lines of Choose your actions wisely because just one bad thing can throw the entire flow of things off balance. Ever since I have been on Lexapro I have found that the little bad things don’t happen as much any more, as long as I stay on them. I never thought I would actually see the day that I would have to be placed on medication for anxiety. I never realized what types of things I did as a direct effect from my anxiety. I would snap at people, be always worried that something bad was going to happen to Jesse or me, stressed after being around my sisters kids for 5 minutes…. Although I don’t think that last one had anything to do with my anxiety (no offense kids). On top of that my Anxiety also affected my health as well.  I am not too sure where I am going with all of this but I guess I just needed to type it out because it was on my mind. Sometimes that happens to me.  Do you want to know the ironic thing about it all? My New Doctor felt I needed to be on medication once I told him what was going on in my life (re: Jesse’s Deployment, School, Work, Health, etc.) and the deciding factor was The deployment.   I always knew the ARMY was going to drive me mad one day.

       Oh my god, what a slow day. Its only 1:30 in the afternoon and I feel like its already time for me to go home. I still have 3 ½ hours left and this is going to drive me mad having to wait that long. It’s a good thing I have my blog otherwise I would have nothing to do on my down time. Today the only thing I have going for me is waiting patiently for my cousin Bernadette to have her baby girl. She went into the hospital at 3:00 am this morning and the baby should be here any time (crossing my fingers). I am awaiting the call from my mom telling me so. It is always so exciting to hear of news of a new member of my already large family, remember that my mom is one of 13 children and each of them average 3 children of there own and it goes on and on.  Well I should be going now, I have some work to do finally... yippy!

       Tonight I talked with Sherry Gudgeon. Her Husband is part of the 319th but as a detachment from another unit. W had a nice long chat and I have to say I like talking to her over the phone verses yahoo chat. She seems like a wonderful lady and so loving. She has a daughter who is 7 years old. I just hope that all of the families that were torn apart get to be reunited soon. I hope to keep on talking to her and hopefully I am able to keep her updated on any information I may hear.

       I had a final in one of my classes yesterday. I was so relieved when it was over with all I wanted to do was tell Jesse about it. So when I got to work I quickly logged on to the Internet and found him on Yahoo, just like he told me he would be. I sort of wished he had been home so I could have celebrated with him, but after all I did get to talk to him online and even a little bit on the phone (he called me at work). It was so nice to hear his voice.   Last night I decided to do a search online to see what I could find regarding the Sacramento based 319th Signal Battalion. I found a whole bunch of links and decided to do some research. There were a few news articles from local area newspapers. They included partial interviews with family members of the 319th. After reading a few I wondered if my day would ever come where I would be contacted regarding my husband and asked for an interview although I am not to sure as to what I would tell them. I also came across a weblog from a member of the 319th   urlLink http://missick.com/ , newly appointed Sgt Chris Missick. He has some wonderful pictures of Kuwait on his site and it’s a great place to read a little about the things a soldier would write about. I actually have to wonder if anyone else in the 319th has a blog going, it would be interesting to see what types of things they write about during their free time.  Other than that nothing new is going on. I am just living each day and my drive is knowing that with each passing day it brings me one-step and day closer to seeing Jesse again.

       One of the most challenging things for me right now is being a good spouse for my husband. I try to be supportive and listen to him when he needs it but there is only so much you can do from in front of your computer screen. You have to find a way to pour all of your sympathy and love into the words you type. For me finding the right words is very tough. I just feel that words are so useless when you know all the other person really needs is a hug and a kiss, or even someone just to sit there and listen to your problems.   It turns out that the case of the missing husband was solved early this morning when I logged in online and found Jesse logged into Yahoo Messenger. I asked him what had happened to him and he told me he wasn’t online because they had him doing guard duty and he had a few days off in there too, which means he usually doesn’t log on when he has days off. I thought he had been in Doha but it turns out he was at Navistar.   It is always amazing to see what idle minds come up with when there is no one to tell you otherwise.

       A few days back my mom came across this picture of me. I couldn’t have been more than 3 years old I was sitting on a large pumpkin. My arms spread out wide like I was hugging the air. I had a wonderful smile from ear to ear. When I saw this picture I instantly remember a picture I had seen of Jesse when he was little. I quickly ran into my room and reached for a small golden colored cardboard box. Inside it there were tons of pictures from Jesse’s past (one of the few things his mom ever gave me that I adore). “Where is it?” I said to myself as I dug through picture filled box. “Ah Ha!” I took a picture out of the box. It was of a little red headed boy sitting on a bail of hay and right next to him was a large pumpkin. I ran into the other room and I showed it to my mom. She thought it was too cute. We think that Jesse was about the same age as me in the picture too.

       I still haven’t heard from Jesse. I think he might actually not be at Navistar anymore. He had told me that he was going to be visiting Camp Doha for some computer training and I am almost sure that that is what he has been up to these last few days. I am sure whatever he is doing he is safe though. I am assuming so since I haven’t heard anything otherwise.   I know in my case I probably know more than I should regarding my husband’s whereabouts but it’s not like I ask him, he tells me. And I really don’t repeat anything that I shouldn’t because he doesn’t tell me the things I shouldn’t know about, any thing top secret. I just hope he is ok.   It has gotten to the point where I really have stopped counting the days. I know Jesse has been in Kuwait for just around 2 months, which really isn’t a long time but her hasn’t been home in over 5 months and that is the longest I have ever been away from him. Counting the day’s just makes it seem worse for me. I hardly ever really look at calendars anymore.   I try to avoid family functions where I know “How’s Jesse?” will be asked. I have to fight back tears sometimes and am really getting quite good at faking a realistic smile. The fact of the matter is that I really miss Jesse and everything about him, from all of the good things, all of the romantic things, right down to all of the crude and yucky things (like his belching – those who know Jesse understand that one). I often think of how wonderful that day will be when I am waiting for him to get off that plain and to run right up to me and give me the biggest hug and kiss he has ever given me. The look on his face when he sees me waiting for him but then I remember how far away all of this is and I have to wonder if the time will really pass quickly or very slow, like it seems to lately.  All I can do is hope to keep busy and keep my mind off of the things that make me sad, like missing him.  Jesse if you read this, I love you!

       I haven’t written in my journal in a while due to the fact that I have been very busy and semi sick. Let’s just say what I thought to be allergies turned out to be a strange viral infection that took over my throat, tongue and mouth, leaving a trail of nasty ulcers. My Doctor said it was probably Herpes Simplex which is caused by stress. I am beginning to think so. I had tons of Homework to catch up on since I left to see Jesse 2 months back. Any way I am so glad I caught up and at the same time got better.   I haven’t talked to Jesse since Friday Morning. He hasn’t been online either. I am not to sure what he has been up to but I am sticking to my motto, no news is better than bad news. I hope he pops back in real soon though, his package is set to arrive in Navistar real soon and I would hate to have it not reach him.   In other news, I feel that the FRG has slowly but surly fallen apart. We were never an organized bunch but I feel as if there is no rhyme or reason to the effort and that is becoming a waste of everyone’s time, not just mine. I guess my original plan of staying busy to pass the time will have to go back, or in this case remain, into affect. I signed up for 13 units next fall and I know that the courses I signed up for will require me to spend a lot of time hitting the books and less time worrying about Jesse.   I know he will be fine I just hate not hearing from him.   I hope he is fine.

       I wish I could say that things are going well for me. I find lately that I have been missing Jesse more and more. Times are even worse for me when I am not feeling well, like today. I have this strange rash slowly taking over my hands and forarms. It itches in some places where it tingles in others (mostly my fingertips). My mom said I had it on my sides and my stomach as well but I really can’t see it there. On top of that I also have tons of little sores in my mouth, on my tongue and in my throat. My Dr. thinks I have a viral infection which is causing the sores in my moth to form (I have been performing religious saltwater washes and now have moved to cleaning my mouth with mouthwash because the salt is burning now). It is hard to eat anything so I have decided Jell-o is probably the way to go from now on. I have a walk-in appointment in the morning so maybe my Dr. will be able to help me with a solution for relief at least. Why do these things happen to me when Jesse is away? I feel so helpless at times and I know if Jesse was home he could make me feel better. I just feel like a mutant with this rash and sores in my mouth, it is actually very depressing to me. I was supposed to go out to church this morning for a special mass for my Nana but my mom advised me not to because I might be contagious and she didn’t want me to give it to anyone pregnant or such. She promised me that when I was better we would go to the cemetery to visit Nana, which was what they were going to do after the service. I wanted to be there for her and to help her in case she got upset. Then afterwards she was going to go out for lunch with Michael (my big Brother) and Candace (his GF/my best friend) and Candace’s Mom Denise. I was invited to go along but mom also doesn’t think that would be a good idea… I don’t think I should go because I might not get to eat anything, not because I might get someone sick. I just feel so alienated. Angela (my Big Sister) thinks I might have Mono, but I don’t really know. All I know is that I am depressed today and I want to lie around and cry. Hold on to my Jesse bear and cry.  I hate feeling so helpless.

       Nothing new has happened today. It seems that my days seem to drag on and on and melt together. Mondays I go to school, Wednesdays and Fridays I go to school then off to work, Tuesdays and Thursdays I got to work most of my day. I usually come home tired but attempt to do homework until I get bored, eat Dinner then log on to the internet to see if Jesse is there and talk to him the rest of the evening, until I go to sleep or he tells me to go to bed. That’s pretty much it, usually. Today is the exception. After work I am walking to catch Light rail and going to my Sister’s house. We are going to take a picture of her, my brother and I and then have it developed and framed for our mom for mother’s day. That was the only thing she wanted this year (although I did order her a nice little rose bush for mother’s day, it’s getting delivered tomorrow). She is going to be so surprised.  In other news, Jesse went to Camp Doha yesterday, I thought it was for some training, but he said it was just to pick up a mini-frig for his work area. I asked him to case the place and see if it really was as nice as I have heard it was. I hope to get to talk to him tonight when I get home from Angela’s. I sure do miss him a lot. I just wish that the time would go by faster and that he was on his way home already. I can’t wait until he gets to come home on leave, it will be so nice to see him again. I just hate being away from him this long. I know that when he come back on leave I wouldn’t get to keep him, but 2 weeks is so much better than nothing, right?  I sure hope that his trip to Doha went ok... I hate those convoys, even if he is in Kuwait.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I wrote a poem today.   Sheltered Heart”  Written by Danielle Chidester 5/5/2004   It sure is dark down there 	I can hardly see a thing I wonder why no light shines in 	Why darkness is all that is seen  Never to see the light of day 	Or the greenness of the grass Never to see kites on strings 	Or all life’s simple things Or know when the day has passed  Open up your windows  And let the world shine in Stop and smell life’s roses Not even thinking of what consequences it will bring  If you hold your heart in your hands  And shelter it from the world You will never know of love 	And the joy love can bring

       This last weekend pooped me out. On Saturday I spent the greater part of 3 hours outside planting a garden form my mom’s birthday. Despite the many complaints from her boyfriend Mike, a landscaper, I felt it turned out wonderful and my mom was so happy with the way it turned out that I really didn’t care what Mike’s opinion was (he seems to have an opinion for everything). Then I took my shower and got ready to go to my nephew Isaac’s 5th Birthday Party. When we got to the party (my mom, her Boyfriend Mike and me) I quickly ran to the backyard of my sister’s house where the party was taking place. I quickly went in search of Isaac because I wanted to wish him a HAPPY BITHDAY!!! When I found him, much to my surprise, he was dressed in his Hulk costume, although I have to wonder why beings that it was probably 90-something degrees outside. Angela, my sister, said that he insisted on wearing it to the party because it was a hulk party. The evening was quite nice, I got to meet some of my sister’s coworkers and their kids and I could tell that the kids were having a blast, playing with water balloons and running around the yard like the little animals they are (you would very much agree if you knew my sister’s kids).  I also got to see my brother and his Girlfriend/my friend Candace. Candace greeted me with a little gift, it was a mini beanie baby bear named spangle and he was the color of the American flag. I thought it was so sweet of her to give it to me. When the party was through my mom, Mike and I took Isaac and went home, you see my gift to him was a day out with auntie and a trip to the Build-A-Bear Workshop. When I got home I was so pooped from my day I pretty much called it a day and went to sleep. The next day I woke up around 7:30 and started my day. I got up and got dressed and ate breakfast, like I always do. Isaac helped me set up my new birdcage, that I bought from a garage sale for $20.00, which was a steal and before I knew it was time for Isaac and I to head out on our way. Mike took us to the Light Rail Station on Florin Road and shortly after the train came and we hopped on. Isaac loved the ride on the train and on our way Downtown we passed the station I catch the train after school to go to work. I pointed out the school to Isaac. In no time we were in Downtown and had met up with my Friend Dale who greeted up with two cold bottles of water and a really cool Hulk watch for Isaac. We hopped on to the next train and headed towards Arden/Del Paso Heights. When we got there our bus was waiting. Isaac got on the bus and showed the Bus Driver his buss Pass, it was so cute. Then off we went to Arden Mall, where the Build-A-Bear Workshop was. When we got there we walked into the mall and to the nearest ATM, after all I needed Money to pay for his bear… and then to Spencer’s Gifts, one of Jesse and I favorite Stores then of to the Build-A-Bear, you should have seen Isaac’s face when we walked up, he was so happy to be there. After several minutes of browsing Isaac decided on a cute black bear to build. He went to the sound station and picked a sound for his bear, “happy Birthday Bear” song and then made his way to the stuffing machine and began the process. Half way through filling up his bear the machine ran out of stuffing do the girl making his bear took Isaac to the stuffing bins and he helped her fill it all up again. Then back to the machine to fill up his bear the rest of the way. He picked a heart from a bin and made a wish and put it inside the bear for safekeeping. Then she closed the bear up and off we went to the fluffing station. We fluffed the bear and then clothed him and Isaac named him King. It was so cute. After I paid for the bear Isaac got to have the store sing “Happy Birthday w/ Cha Cha Cha’s” and they rang a big bell in his honor. Then off to lunch we went. The day was so fun but by the end I could tell that Isaac was pooped and so was I. I know he had the best birthday ever though and that was exactly what I had set out to do.  The only thing I regret about this weekend is that I wasn't able to talk to Jesse. I just wish that Jesse could have been there… :-(

       Today I feel a little sick to my stomach. I think it was something I ate. The sad thing though is that usually Jesse helps me feel better when my stomach hurts. His hands were always so warm and the warmth from them always made my stomach feel better. I would have him place his hand on my stomach, where it hurt and he would always make the pain go away. He always thought that that was so funny. Other than that, things are going ok, less than smooth but ok. I have tons of schoolwork to finish up before the end of the semester but I am fairly confident I will get most of it finished in time, I always do.   Now that I think about it... I don't really want to go to work in the morning...... why can't it be friday again.

       My friend Melissa and I were able to move everything into Storage and the strange p[art was that my Mother-in-law was actually nice to me. That was a first in a long time.   I find that today I miss Jesse more than usual. Maybe because I am having problems and I need him to be home to make everything better, knowing full well that one person can’t fix everything that goes wrong. I have to wonder if God plays a part in the things that happen to me, and in a since I feel that what is going on right now is taking me away from my friends and drawing me closer to my family. It is strange how things work out and most of the time all you can do is wait and see what the life throws at you. My birthday is in a week and I will be 24. I feel like my birthday should mean more to me then it does, I feel like it should mean more then just another day closer to having Jesse home, but the way things have turned out today I could really care less as to whether I am around for my birthday or not. I have a very special 3-day weekend planed for the weekend of my birthday; I am going to Anaheim with my Mom, her Boyfriend Mike and my two Nephews (Isaac and Jacob). I was so happy about this when I heard from my mom, but now I am not to sure how much fun it is going to be, especially if I am not happy while I am there. I sure hope that this mood of mine wares off by then though.  I am sure my attitude for today is the only reason I am not to stoked about the trip.  The FRG Newsletter is going very well and I cannot wait until I show Sgt. Kingsley the finished Product. My Big Sister let me borrow a book on making Newsletters and I am going to peruse it tonight for some ideas on next months issue.

       I had a very long weekend and as I sit here at my desk on the warm Monday afternoon all I can think about is how I have 40 minutes left of work then I am going to be home for my first evening in a two days. Yesterday was the best. I went to the 8th Annual Day in the Zone and scored me the autographs of the members of the band LIVE.  As seen pictured here:    This is the first time I have ever gotten anyone’s autograph ever and I plan to make a keepsake picture out of it once I get some pictures of the band members.  I also got to talk to Jesse a little bit on the phone yesterday. It is always so good to hear his voice, I just whish he was home now and not later. I miss him so much. On Saturday I got to be a part of an event that involved the BIA (Building Industry Association), it was called Boxes for Builders. It involved several local building companies and tons of nonperishable goods and toiletries to be sent to all of the soldiers of A, B and HHC Company of the 319th Sig Bn. I go to be a part of the effort and in a little over two hours 500 boxes were filled, labeled and pilled up ready to be shipped to our soldiers.   As part of the HHC and Editor for our newsletter I am going to do a little write-up for the event and I want to share my feelings about what these people did for our guys and gals over in the giant sandbox.   I had the busiest but best weekend ever.

       Tonight I had a date... and lucky me, it was with Two guys.  Now I know what you all are thinking, I am wrong to do this while my husband is away, but he knows about it.  Now before I get thousands of comments along the lines of, “how could you be so insensitive” or “What is wrong with you, your husband is overseas”, let me explain myself.  The two guys are good friends of ours and they both happen to be gay.  So no worries there, I am not so drop dead gorgeous that I could turn a gay man straight.  But also notice I said had a date.  That’s right, had...  I just got a call from my friend Paul, of my gay gentleman callers telling me that he has to cancel because he doesn’t feel good.  I told him that was fine and to go home and feel better soon.   I just feel bad that not only did I have a dinner/movie date with two guys that were gay, but they also cancelled on me.   In other news, Jesse and I finally connected again.  I was so happy to see that little messenger box pop up with a cheerful little “brrring” and lovely text that read “hello!”  He had a boring time at the other camp and felt that the trip was completely pointless, but at the same time I posed to him, that even though the meeting was boring, he did get a chance to leave his camp and get a slight break from his normal routine.  He agreed.  He also said he got the package I sent with the mystery gift; now that he has it I can share what I made.  I made him two pillows, one with our niece and two nephews on it and the other with my cat and I on it.  He said he absolutely loved them, but most likely he wouldn’t use them because he didn’t want to mess them up.  He also commented on how adorable Jacob (my oldest nephew) sounded on the audio tape I sent him, he sang the song “America the Beautiful” it was so sweet, I am going to try to see if I can get him to do it again so I can have a copy of it on my computer.  At about 2:00 in the afternoon Jesse told me he was getting sleepy and he was heading to bed.  I told him to sleep well, that I loved him and I would talk to him soon.  I also told him that I have a very busy weekend ahead and may not be home so if he can, to call me on my cell hone and we can talk for a little bit and he said ok.  He knows no matter where I am at I will always make the time to talk to him.  I have a just about a ½ hour left of work then off to home, where I will either work on the FRG Newsletter or my other side project, a web page for a friend of mine.

       These last few days have been pretty good considering that I haven’t spoken to Jesse. Today I watch him, as he is idle on his computer most likely due to him working on someone’s computer or tweaking his or something along the lines of that. I am not to sure what his shift looks like for today but I am going to wait here in hopes I get to talk to him before he is off shift. The way its been going ever since C Co. has taken over the position that Bravo Co. once maintained at the camp Jesse is at, we can never make heads or tails out of a stable work schedule which poses a slight strain on communication but I am grateful for the time we do get and I am so thankful that they have computer access there and at their disposal if needed.   In other news, I have reconnected with an old friend of ours named Melissa, and loving every chance I get to talk to her. She is exactly what I need right now and she lives very close to my mom’s so that just makes everything so much better. She is coming over to my mom’s on Tuesday and is going to help me move some things out of my Mother-in-laws because my M-I-L was nagging/yelling at me to come get it, long story. So Melissa offered her services and we are going out to storage on Tuesday.   Melissa has also helped me out with the FRG Newsletter. I told her that I was going to hire her on as a helper because she went in search for images to go with this article I had in the newsletter. I am trying so hard to make this issue work and also be a great source of information to those who read it. I guess my expectations are high but it is very exciting for me to be able to do this, even though I was very reluctant at first. I feel I am doing a good service for those who can’t be actively involved with the FRG due to place of residence or conflict in work schedules. These people need to be treated like they are a part of the FRG even though they can’t be at the meetings and events; they need to feel like they are being thought of too.   Tomorrow is a big day for the HHC FRG, we have two events going, 1) Boxes for Builders, where care packages are made and shipped to all of the Soldiers of HHC, and 2) the 319th Battalion wide 4th of July Barbeque/Picnic. I have been asked to attend both events and will be photographing them as well. I hope to be able to do a little write up regarding tomorrow’s event for the Newsletter as well.  Then on Sunday I get to go to a concert (the 8th Annual Day in the Zone) with my Brother-in-law and Big Sister. They are taking me as an early birthday present. I can’t wait because I get to see one of my favorite bands play, (((TRAIN))), Melissa Ethridge and Live are also going to be there… oh yeah and William Hung from American Idol (woo hoo… please note the sarcasm on that one).   Overall I know that this weekend is going to be the best ever and I am happy to be a part of the events taking place.  I am definitely keeping myself busy, busy, busy.

        Tribute to my Love:  Yesterday I spent the evening with an old friend of Jesse and mine named Melissa. I can safely say if it wasn’t for her Jesse and I would have never gotten together. I actually had no Idea she was even still in Sacramento and then out of the blue *poof* I hear the old familiar sound of a messenger window popping up and a “Hey it’s me Melissa!” Typed on the screen. I proceeded to chat with her for most of the day and then she invited me over to hang out and have dinner with her, her boyfriend Mihn and their kitty of many names. I had a great time and didn’t wind up getting home until close to 2:00 am. It was so nice to be able to hang out without a care in the world. What is even better about the whole thing is that Melissa lives like 15-minute bike ride away from my mom’s house, so I can go hang whenever I need too. She is also going to be helping me move some stuff out of my mother-in-laws house next week and I told her I would take her out to get something to eat afterwards for all of her help. I explained to her why I wasn’t able to go by Vikki’s (my In law) house and how after I went to Texas to see Jesse my grandmother had passed away and how I got sick, plus not having a truck/car/van to pick the stuff up and take it to storage. She said she understood that some times things happen and offered to help me out. That was so sweet of her. I am so glad I spent the evening with her.  In other news, I don’t foresee talking to Jesse much for then next couple of days. He had to travel outside of his camp to another camp for a meeting about something (I am being very vague for security reasons). He should be back in two days and I asked him if he wouldn’t mind taking his camera so I could have some shots of the Kuwaiti road side and see what the other camp looks like. Hopefully he remembers. I hate when we aren’t able to talk but I know no news is often better then bad news and as long as I hear good news or nothing at all he is fine.   These last few weeks I have met up with a few people from my past and have reminisced on a great many high school memories and as I think back now, Jesse and I are even more so in love with each other then we were back then. In High school we were inseparable and most of the time if you were looking for one of us, you found both of us and just had to deal with the fact that we were the pair to be reckoned with.  I remember a time when I was asked to think out of the box per say. One of my friends had asked me to imagine that Jesse and I weren’t together, to help prove a point regarding relationships. When she said this to me I just looked back at her in disbelief, and told he I couldn’t imagine life without Jesse. She then proceeded to ask Jesse to do the same and he told her no way. She said come on guys, pleading for us to humor her and we just looked at each other and holding hands walked away saying nope, nope nuh unh, both of us smiling from ear to ear.   I also recall a lower point in my life that Jesse was able to help me get through (believe you me there have been a few). Each one he was there for me and would hold on to me tighter because he knew I needed it. This instance was at the small funeral service of my late Grandmother Delores. I couldn’t bring myself to see her in her casket and when they tried to get me to look I just cried more. She was very sick and when she died she looked as if she was someone else. I wanted to remember her for the way she was before she became bed ridden and helpless. Jesse made the long trip to Bakersfield with my mom and I and stood by my side every moment until we got right back home to Sacramento, some 5 hours later.   I wish he could have been home for my Nana Pauline’s funeral; it would have been so much easier for me to deal with. But he was on a plane to Kuwait.   Someone told me that I am very codependent of Jesse and that may be but I love him more than anything and worship the ground he walks on. He is a hard worker and has endured so much just for me alone. He has filled bathtubs up with warm water from the kitchen sink, ridden his bike half way across Sacramento just so he could be by my side in an emergency room. He has held me while I cried over stubbing my toe, and made it a point to tell me that I am a goddess in my eyes where all I see is a plane Jane. And what gets me the most is that all of those things he doesn’t see, and he has asked me on his lowest days, why I deal with him and all I can say is, “because I love you.”  I have been with Jesse for 6 years and 7 months and of course I am codependent, and I am not ashamed of the fact that I am. He has been a part of my life for 7 ½ years as the best friend anyone could ever have. I remember once, before we got together, he almost got into a fight with some kids because he was messing with me and had pulled my wig off of my head, it had been pinned (this was Halloween and I was dressed up as Raggedy Ann) and he had hurt me in doing this. When I told my best friend about it, he was ready to go after the guy who had did it to me. He has always been there for me and in these times I find it hard to get through my days without a fake smile because I miss him a lot and to make my smile less false I think of these little things he does and I smile from ear to ear.

        I would like to once again thank all of those out there who have continued to show their support to me and the rest of the families out there in the same situation as me I appreciate all of the feedback I have been getting both positive and negative and hope that I receive more positive feedback in the future. Sometimes I need to be made aware of the mistakes I make so I can learn from my actions. The support I receive from you readers helps drive me to share my experiences with all of you.   ~Thank you   Today I would like to retract a statement I made a while back about not having my friends there to support me when I needed it. A Few days back I sat down and wrote a very lovely letter to a good friend of Jesse and mine named Patricia. I have known her off and on for the last couple of years but only through association from an online support group for BBW.  I didn’t actually really get to know her until right around receiving the news of Jesse’s deployment. She has made it a point to message me every day just to ask me how my day is going and she keeps me company when she see that Jesse isn’t online talking to me. She also does the same for him whenever he is online and I am not. We have become very close and Jesse and I plan to make a trip out to her hometown when he comes back from Kuwait for good. I am forever grateful for the fact that she is a part of our life and extension to our family and look forward to the day of finally meeting her face to face and Jesse and I giving her a hug sandwich.        In FRG News:  I have been asked to work on the newsletter for the FRG. At first I was a little reluctant to do so but I figure it can give me something to do to pass the time away and also get me more involved with the FRG. I love to write and I hope that even if this is a temporary thing, my efforts are appreciated. I am also the (un-official) Photo-historian. This is a position that was made up at the last minute. My duties will include taking photos of all of the FRG events and compiling them in a library of sorts so that they are available for anyone to view (for example, soldiers of the 319th, the higher ups, or even family and friends of the 319th soldiers). I can also incorporate these images into the newsletter as well, which will give those who receive it a chance to see what our events tend to look like.

       Part of one of the advantages of maintaining a relationship with my husband via Internet chat is that it adds a little spice to the relationship. Today Jesse and I did some shopping for sexy lingerie online, just window-shopping. It’s always so nice to see what he will come up with and what he would like to see me in and it’s a little something we can do together. The fun part about it is it makes the time he has left seem shorter than it is. We also do online window-shopping with other items like books and computer supplies, but it is always so much more fun, and not to mention romantic when he is sending me links to beautiful robes and baby dolls and such and talking about how beautiful I would look in them. One of the items he found was a black leather mini skirt. I laughed because he was so adamant in buying it for me but at the same time it sparked a conversation about going out more when he gets back, because we weren’t ones for going out. Our going out was a casual walk or bike ride to Denny’s for shrimp scampi, for me, and a burger or steak, for him and then a casual stroll back home with our stuffed bellies. It was always so nice going to Denny’s but I think we have been to a nice restaurant all but maybe 4 times in the 6 years, 7 months we have been together. He promised me that would change and that we would make more time for each other.   It is always interesting seeing which direction our conversations will go after each link is posted from him. Its like a little lovers game of sorts and very fun because its something we both can be involved with even though we are ½ a world apart.

       I know its has been a few days since I have written. There have been a lot of things on my mind and I have taken the time away to sort out the mess. Just s o all of you don’t think I am a rotten wife to my soldier husband, everything that has happened to me I have openly shared with him. He understands that I am just looking for people to talk to and that I cant find that comfort with our friends because they always seem to be too preoccupied with themselves to listen to anyone else but themselves. Friday night I went out with my friend Dale, who if you remember has been having relationship issues and was the cause of all of my stress a little while back. I took him out to eat and then took him to one of Jesse and mine talking spots, I told him I wanted to take him somewhere Jesse and I frequented just to watch the sun set. We sat there and talked a long time. I told him about how I was doing and how I felt about this whole situation, a lot of it I needed to get off of my chest. There were some things he told me that I don’t think/ remember I said from the night I went to his apartment and drank a little too much (Just so you all who don’t know are aware, Dale is Jesse and mine gay friend and is just about the only guy, besides Ron and Paul who are also both gay, that I hang out with). I asked my friend Jack, who lives in another state, whom I was also on the phone with during the time if such things were supposedly said and he told me that I didn’t say anything like what Dale told me I said. I know this is confusing probably to read, and believe me it is very confusing when I think about the whole thing. Today I spoke to Jesse about the whole thing and he said not to worry about it because Dale was drinking that night and he has a tendency to say things happened that didn’t. I told Jesse that I love him very much and he knows that if I could I would move the stars and the earth for him, just to be with him in Kuwait. Because I don’t remember much from that night I have to wonder what all I said to Dale, Ron (who were both there) and Jack (via phone). Supposedly Ron is going to call and talk to me about the whole thing but I am still waiting for that call and I doubt it will ever happen.  Anyway once again the reason why I am not going to be drinking anything until Jesse comes back.

       I first heard about this story a few days back. All I could think about is that "They are going to behead this innocent man, for being nothing more than American" This article is taken from  urlLink MSNBC ... I pray for his family today.   American hostage reportedly beheaded  Demands had given Saudis 72 hours to save Paul Johnson's life MSNBC News Services Updated: 1:55 p.m. ET June 18, 2004 urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5196406/"> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5196406/    RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - A statement published on an Islamic Web site Friday claimed that American hostage Paul Johnson had been beheaded. The Web site also published photos apparently showing Johnson after death. The claim could not be independently confirmed.  "As we promised ... we have beheaded the American hostage Paul Marshall (Johnson) after the deadline ... passed," the statement said. It was signed by the Organization of al-Quid in the Arabian Peninsula.  The Saudi correspondent for the Arab satellite network Al-Arabia earlier told CNN he had seen a video of the beheading.  Thousands of Saudi security forces had intensified their search of fundamentalist strongholds Friday as the deadline approached for Johnson to be executed by his Islamic militant kidnappers.  The kidnappers did not set a specific time when the deadline runs out. A videotape with the threat appeared on a Web site at about midnight Tuesday Saudi time, and if counted from that point the 72 hours would run out by midnight Friday, or 5 p.m. ET Friday.  In the video, the kidnappers vow to kill Johnson unless the Saudi government released all the militants in its prisons. The Saudis have rejected the demand.  Police vehicles drove through the Swede, Dhahran al-Boudoir and Bard districts overnight and into Friday, but the authorities gave no indication they were any closer to finding Johnson, an employee of the U.S. defense corporation Lockheed Martin who was kidnapped last weekend.  Reuters A June 12 posting on the Sawt al Jihad Islamist Web site, shows the photo of Paul Johnson, whom militants said they had kidnapped that day. People living in the three districts, which lie in western and southern Riyadh, suggest that the kidnappers enjoy popular support, partly because of U.S. policy in Iraq and its perceived backing for Israel.  "How can we inform on our brothers when we see all these pictures coming from Abu  and Rajah," Mukluks NOF, a resident of Dhahran al-Boudoir, said at a restaurant called Jihad, or holy war in Arabic. He was referring to the pictures of Iraqis abused by U.S. soldiers at the Abu  prison in Baghdad and the Israeli military's killing of Palestinians and the destruction of their homes in the Gaza refugee camp of Rajah.  "This is not a little skirmish. It is a war," NOF added.  But a top Saudi cleric, the preacher of Imam Sultana Mosque in Riyadh, implored the kidnappers to release Johnson in a column published in Al-Riyadh newspaper on Friday.  "O, youth of the nation who have trodden the wrong path, come back to the fold of the community of Islam. Avoid this sedition and be obedient to the ruler of the Muslims," Sheik Mohammed bin Sad al-Saeed wrote, referring to King Fahd.  And Johnson's Thai wife, Thanom, appealed for her husband's release on the Saudi-owned satellite TV channel Al-Arabiya. "When I see him in TV, I remember the medicine he needs," she said, her voice wavering. "I am afraid. I will do my best for him. Please bring him back to me."  Few leads A senior Saudi official in the United States said officials have had few promising leads in their search for Johnson, whose kidnappers claim to be the al-Qaida chapter in Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said there had been no communications from the kidnappers except for the video and statement on the Web site.  The FBI has sent a team of about 20 specialists in hostage rescue, hostage negotiations, profiling and other specialties who were working directly with Saudi officials, the official said. Reuters American hostage Paul Johnson as shown in a video released by his apparent captors.  More than 15,000 Saudi officers have been deployed in the search of Riyadh, going door-to-door in some neighborhoods. More than 1,200 Saudi homes had been searched as of Thursday night.  "We are even using the fire department, for instance, because they have knowledge of their neighborhoods, and districts," the official said. The Saudi official said the suspected leader of al-Qaida in the kingdom, Abdulaziz Issa Abdul-Mohsin al-Moqrin, whom the video tape identified as the hooded man making a speech, is also the main suspect in the shootings of a German citizen and an American in the kingdom recently.  Johnson, 49, had worked in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade.   Vigils back home  Friends and relatives of Johnson sang "Amazing Grace" and "God Bless America" as they held candles and small flags at a vigil late Thursday in Eagleswood, N.J., a town where the engineer had lived.  "Your love, your prayers and your support are appreciated," his niece Angle Roork said at the vigil.  More than 200 people attended the service in Port St. John, Fla., where Johnson’s son, Paul Johnson III, lives.  “We feel helpless here. I bet most people here have an awful feeling that this might be futile,” said Father Tony Quinlivan of Blessed Sacrament in Cocoa, Fla. “But it’s never futile when a community comes together.”  Amid concern over Johnson's fate, the U.S. State Department updated a 2-month-old travel warning for Saudi Arabia, pointing out that attacks on Americans there have resulted in deaths and injuries and, in a reference to Johnson, a kidnapping. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.

       I understand that my actions were very stupid yesterday. I do admit giving this guy my number was also a very stupid move as well. I did wind up emailing that guy mapping out that my sole intention of letting him call me was purely for friendly conversation. I didn’t appreciate him coming on as strong as he did and I guess that makes me naive but this time away from Jesse has left me lonely and unsatisfied with general conversation with my peers so I have been looking for friendly people to talk to online. I never intend on attracting these people and I do always let them know that I am happily married. I just don’t understand why they feel like the internet is just one huge dating game when I know there are kind and decent people out there like me who just want someone to talk too.   Despiration drive people to do some stupid things.  In other news, I received a package from Jesse a few days back. He sent me this beautiful blanket that was on his bed in Kuwait, smelled a little like him. The blanket had a beautiful wolf on it and I plan on sleeping with that blanket every night until he comes back. He also sent me an audiotape letter. Although it was short, it was still good to hear his voice. On his letter he mentioned that he had gained some weight. Mind you all that know Jesse know that he is a bean poll, so imagine my surprise when I heard this. He is still tiny to me, but he gained enough weight to move up one size and I figure that means there is more of him for me to love when he comes home. I did wind up talking to him a few days back but it was only for a half an hour, long enough for me to find out that they changed his work schedule again. Ever since that night I haven’t been able to connect with him online. I do know that he does go online and does read my blog to see what’s happening with me, but I do miss our online chats during the day, because it always seemed to help pass the time away. I know that our little chats always improved our workdays.   I miss him a lot.

       The nerve of some people! I have been trying to use the AKO (ARMY Knowledge Online) Instant Messenger because Jesse has been having Issues with Yahoo ever since they upgraded their Email services. Well I figured that AKO would be a little more stable and that since AKO is used for military personnel that I probably wouldn’t have problems with attracting the wrong type of people like I have been on yahoo. Well today I was wrong. I met this guy on AKO and he asked if he could call me to talk, I told him sure why not but only if he promised to keep it on the clean side. He said sure… so about 20 minutes later he called and after one minute of conversation with him I was pretty sure of what his intensions were. I just wish that I didn’t attract these people. I love Jesse and I don’t understand what would give these guys the idea that if they said some stupid pickup line, I would throw away 6 ½ years of a relationship away for a cheesy pick up line, please!  Most of the time all I am looking for is someone to talk to and nothing more. And for some reason they just don’t see that, no matter how many times I type it out for them in plain English.  What am I going to do?

        Just another random ranting:   I often, wonder what exactly is going on in the head of my soldier husband. I haven’t spoken with him in a few days I have to admit that I am not too worried but I do miss him a lot. Soon my friend Danielle Barber’s Husband David will be coming home on his two-week leave. I know that Danielle must be very excited but upon his return I am also reminded about how the ARMY screwed Jesse out of his R&R request and how he will not be coming home in July. I am very angry because I really was looking forward to seeing Jesse again, even if it was just for two weeks. Every time I talk to him I always ask him if he has heard anything about the second wave of R&R but he says not yet. I just don’t want him to get screwed out of his chance to come home even if it is only for a little while. I just hate having this feeling inside of me, this empty feeling. I see these couples walking hand and hand, or hugging and kissing and I am reminded that even though I have someone, I don’t have that. I see young couples walking side by side with their little ones and I don’t have that either. I miss feeling the way it feels to be in love and intimacy. Don’t get me wrong though, I do very much so love my husband and I always will but I am reminded that we have only been a married couple for 7 months together and 8 months apart and when he gets home it will be very close to celebrating our 2-year wedding anniversary. Every day I look at my wedding ring and I remember the day I said “I Do” to our minister under the shade of a beautiful shade tree, in front of my family and his and I smile from ear to ear. I often wonder if he thinks about that day, or anything else I think about.

        Problems with healthcare:  So I am sure that all of you who read are fairly interested in what types of things a military wife has to encounter. Today my stress involved a 40-minute hold on the phone with little company called Quest Diagnostics involving me and a bill for the wonderful amount of $53.25. I know that you are all wondering what the big idea regarding this bill is, well the plain and simple fact of the matter is that I shouldn’t be receiving bill at all, beings that I am a member of Tricare Prime, all of my medical expenses are free, which is the least the government can do for the families of Active Duty military personnel. So you can imagine my surprise when I received this bill for $53.25. Well after 40-minutes someone finally picked up my call and after explaining what I had been told by Tricare, whom I was on the phone for 20+ minutes with before the 40-minute Quest call, I come to learn that what I was told by Tricare contradicted what Quest had to say. So more confused then I was before the wonderful lady at Quest Diagnostics insured me that I would not be charged for the said amount and that they would go ahead and resubmit the charge to Tricare to see if they would clear the cost and if I received another invoice from Quest to go ahead and call them back and they would deal with the situation. She understood that I had no co-pay therefore I need not to pay this invoice. Lets just hope that this gets solved in a timely manner.  The next thing I had to deal with today, also a medical insurance matter, involved a silly little mix up regarding my birthday with my husband’s. It seems that every time I go to fill a prescription from my Doctor’s office there is some sort of hold up at the pharmacy due to the fact that my Doctor’s office gives them my birthday but the medical insurance shows my husbands birthday as mine. So I had to call 3, yes three numbers to get this fixed. The first two were Tricare and TricareWest. Tricare told me that TricaeWest handles this now and to update the info with them. When I called TricareWest they said to contact this company called Express Script, after 25 minutes on the phone with them they are now telling me to call DEERS, but that they are closed for the day and to call them tomorrow… good lord all of this over a mistake in birth dates.   I am beginning to wonder why some people have to make life so hard.

        Saturday:  Today we had a baby shower to go to. The dummy who was throwing the party gave really lame directions and we got lost and so turned around that by the time we got to the shower we were an hour late. The trip was worth it just to see the face of the expectant mother when we walked in. After that we drove back home and relaxed for all but a few moments. Then off we went to my niece Elizabeth “Bits” birthday party. It was so great to be surrounded my sister’s kids, they have such an awesome energy about them and you can’t help but be in good spirits around them.   Although the day was tiresome it was well worth it because I got a chance to spend it with my family and if you know me at all, family is the most important thing to me.    Sunday:  Today stared out pretty relaxed, this is a great way to start any day. I got to sleep in and finally do one of my favorite Sunday activities, eat a nice bowl of cereal and read the Sunday funnies. Today we are going to go over to my Nanu’s house and visit with an old family friend of my mom’s. She hasn’t seen this person in over 40+ years. I can’t wait to get a chance to meet her because I know that this will be a great opportunity to hear stories about my mom’s childhood.   In other news, I got my birthday present from Jesse yesterday, he bought me a dainty  ruby ring. It is very beautiful and just the way I like my jewelry, elegantly simple.   I have also had one of the most relaxing weeks ever, at least since I haven’t been taking too many calls on my cell phone. I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and my big heart has endured too much stress for me to handle these last few days. So I have made the decision to keep all phone calls to a minimum, unless it’s someone from the FRG because chances are it’s the people who are brining me the most anxiety. I tried to tell them that I can’t handle this and would prefer to be left out of it all together but I can’t get a word in edgewise. It isn’t that I choose not to listen to their problems it that I really cant listen because the stress and anxiety is making me so sick and for health reasons I find it best not to subject myself to the unwanted stress.   Don’t get me wrong I do love my friends but I just can’t handle this, It’s not my problem so why involve me?  Today I talked to my friend Dale and told him how I felt. I said to him that it’s not that I don’t care for him as a friend but I have to distance myself from the stress because it’s effecting me and my health. He said he understood and apologized, saying that he never meant to involve me like he has. This is a good step for him.

       Today was the national day of mourning for the late President Ronald Reagan. Although I was very saddened by the news of his death I was also relieved that I didn’t have to go into work today. I feel sort of selfish in saying this, but it gave me the chance to be a part of something wonderful in my eyes, my Oldest Nephew Jacob (6 years) graduation from kindergarten. It was the cutest thing to have ever gotten a chance to witness. The kids sang two songs, “America the Beautiful” and “I believe I can Fly”. They sung their little hearts out. Then we got to see all of the kids receive their certificates of completion for their first year of elementary school.   I also volunteered my time to do body stamping for the children in all of the kindergarten classes at his school (don’t worry that’s just two classes). It was so fun to be around all of this positive energy and the experience did loads of wonder for my stress levels, I was actually able to think clearly and enjoy my day without having to worry about my friends and their issues (no offense but I know that is what friends are there for, but sometimes you just need a break from the drama). After about 40+ kids, all painted and happy, they decided it was my turn and proceeded to color my arms and legs. It was an awesome sight to see. I was readily open to allow these little Picasso’s to use my arms and legs as their canvases but after a while they wanted to move from my arms and legs to my face. Now I am not too picky about my arms and legs, but I do have to draw a line when it comes to my face. But lets just say, once the children were done with their tiny masterpieces I wore them proudly and brushed off the faces of disapproval from the visiting parents because the artist became the art and I was displaying several tiny pieces of art drawn by wonderful 5 & 6 year olds.  So without further ado I present to you Canvas a’la Danielle!!!  Please be pacient, there are five images that are going to be loading           Kids are just so awesome to be around!  I so needed today.

       Today this entry is very hard for me to type, not because of the content but because of a reoccurring pain in my right hand. I have been dealing with this pain for the greater portion of the last year and a half and now its finally getting to me to the point where simple tasks are getting difficult to perform, like pressing down the nozzle of a shaving cream can, or opening jars. So today I am going to call my doctor to see if I can get an appointment because I really don’t think I can take this pain anymore. This is especially not good being that my job is centered on using my hands to type and such; I work in a clerical position.   I just called the doctors office and they set me up for an appointment for next Wednesday. I hope they can do something for me. I also asked them to refill my prescription for Lexapro. I don’t think I can survive my life without them right now. I do hate feeling like I need to be on these pills, but I know they are helping and that is the important thing to remember.   I got to talk to Jesse last night on the phone. It was so good to hear his voice, same old’ Jesse. I am also almost finished with his surprise gift. I finished one of them and have one left but he still doesn’t know what it is I am making him. I love this because he keeps on trying to trick me into telling him but I catch his attempts and tell him he will just have to wait to see. All he has figured out is that I am making him something that involves sewing something. But he still has no clue… this is so fun. I should have the finished product out in the mail by sometime next week. Since I have Wednesday off I guess I should plan on mailing it then.   I wish I could see his face when he gets it though… Maybe I can talk him into having someone take his picture when he opens it up… That would be cool.  Any way, I don’t have work tomorrow so my plans are to go see my nephew Jacob’s school ceremony then I am probably going to go home and try to sort though the mess that has become my room. Sometimes when I am stressed cleaning helps me, which is funny because I really dislike cleaning my room.

       First off I would like to thank those who show their continual support for me. I understand that the life of a soldier’s spouse is seldom ever visited. But it is a known fact that there are plenty of us out there to share our stories with all of you. It is a hard job and one that is often taken for granted. The military spouse has to maintain a household, and care for the family that was left behind while their loved one devotes their life to serving their country and fighting to keep the U.S. a free and safe place to live.   I have no children to care for, but I do have myself and because of the dish that God served me, was forced to change my way of life. I had to revert to where I was before I moved out of my mom’s house to live the life I had known for the last 2 ½ years but this time I am a wife with no husband. It’s a strange feeling to be some ones wife but not have them there. People tell me that I should have expected this whole thing, but I tell them they are very wrong in saying that to me. My husband was not always an Active Duty Soldier. His ARMY career was something he did one weekend a month, two weeks a year. It was like a school that he attended part-time where he learned new skills to help him in life like discipline, loyalty, strength, perseverance, and technical understanding. When he would go away for A.T., he would be gone for 3 months or so, and I was ok with that. I missed him a lot while he was away, but I knew that at the end of the 3 months he would be coming home to me and everything would be just as it was. Jesse never let the ARMY change him as a person. He would pick up habits and sometimes I would catch them shinning through, but I always told him to turn off soldier mode and that I wanted to talk to my Jesse now and no matter what the Jesse I have grown to love would always be there for me.   So it was my choice to pack up our life and tuck it away in a cozy 9 ½ x 10 x 9 ft storage unit and move back in with my mom, back into my childhood room, and make best of what God had given me. One of my favorite saying is,  When life gives you lemons, make lemonade  so that is what I am doing. I have taken this time away from Jesse to concentrate on the things I have always loved doing. I am drawing again, I am enjoying crafts, being with my family and even though life offers me downs, I try to make the best of what I have because I am fortunate to have my Husband on the other side of the Iraqi border, to have him safe in Kuwait. Where he can here echoes of bombs, and gunfire off in the horizon.   Sometimes life throws you rotten lemons and all you can do is toss them aside and keep on picking up the ones that would make the best lemonade and that what I have been trying to do. I am going to attend my first full semester of school in August and I know that it will be quite a challenge but I am not going to let the lemons get in my way of taking this time apart to grow as a person and to work on the parts of me that I feel need to be fixed (my self esteem).   I guess its good for me that I love Lemonade!

         todays venting  I find now, that in times of need the FRG and my family are there for me. There was never any doubt about that. The thing that bothers me though is that some of my friends aren’t there for me and what is even worse is the fact that it took getting me drunk for them to realize that I wasn’t as ok as I make everyone believe. I do have to say that the Lexapro that my doctor put me on has helped me deal with the depression and anxiety that comes along with this whole situation, and although I am usually against using medication to solve my problems, sometimes it’s the best route to a resolution. No one outside of my immediate family knows that I am on anti-depressants and if it ever came up in a conversation I would proudly say I am taking them. I am not ashamed that this is what I have resulted in doing to take care of myself during these hard times because some times talking it out doesn’t help. It’s just a quick fix and not more than 2 hours later you are wondering why you told this person everything you did. I know when I attended therapy sessions I opened myself up to my doctor and then afterwards would mentally beat myself up once I realized what I said to her about my family and friends. I guess looking back on it I felt that those things needed to come out because they were things that were eating at me but I couldn’t ever understand why I would confide my thoughts and feelings in a complete stranger, a doctor that all I knew about her was her name.  I guess with things happening the way they have these last few days, I feel like the medication isn’t working and that I would give anything to confide my deepest darkest secrets to that mystery doctor, for just a half an hour just to be able to talk to someone who wouldn’t judge me by my words, just to have a sense that someone was actually listening to me and my concerns.  I know if any of my friends happen to read this entry that will probably feel that I am using this as an opportunity to personally attack them, but that is not my point. I am just trying to use this as a way to compensate for the lack of communication/dialogue between live persons. I love my friends more then they probably realize but they have their own lives they have to take care of and I don’t expect them to be there for me 100%, I would never expect that, I just want to have an ear to listen to me when I need it, just like I have done for them in the past, several times.   Right now they can’t be here for me because they have their own things and I understand that, I guess I just wish that they didn’t.   I am wondering if I am being selfish about this whole thing.

       What a night. I decided that I was going to stay at my friend Dale’s apartment last night. We had fun for the most part then we decided we were going to indulge in a little alcohol consumption. I have to admit that I might have drank a little too much last night, I had two 16 oz glasses of a drink called the Washington Apple and one 8 oz bottle of mudslide (but thats all I remember drinking). I warned my friends that I couldn’t handle my alcohol plus it had been a very, very long time since I last indulged like that. Any way long story very short, I wound up crying about how I miss Jesse and how him being overseas was unfair, for about a ½ an hour.   I guess the only way I can drink now is if Jesse is here, otherwise all I will do is cry about how I miss him.   No more drinking for me.

        ”Bore” By: Danielle C. 6/4/2004   Take it all away, All the angst, All the pain, I think I prefer  When my life was a bore.  No more decisions, No more plans to be made, No more upsets, No more friendships to fade, I think I prefer When my life was a bore.  The fact of the matter is Everything was just simpler When my life was a bore.

       Yesterday was a pretty good day, at least until I got off of work and went home. My mom and I decided to do a little shopping so we made our way to a local Myrvin’s Department store. I had gone there for one thing only, a food saver vacuum sealer that was on sale for $59.99 (org. $112.99) I figured it would be a very useful thing for me to use to send Jesse cookies and such, all vacuumed sealed and kept fresh. Just as I was getting ready to leave the store my cell phone rang, I ignored it because I was very busy with checking out. Once we got to the care I check the message. It was from my friend Dale asking me to give him a call when I got a chance because he wanted to know about our plans for the weekend. I didn’t call him back because I was on my way to Mel’s Diner (a 60’s style Hamburger Joint) for dinner with my mom and I figured I could call him when I got home. While I was eating he called again and after him there were two calls from his ex, my other friend, Paul. All this time I was just trying to eat dinner with my mom.   A very, very, very long story short, Dale was upset because my friend Ronnie (who just returned to Sacramento after being stationed in Korea for the greater portion of 2 years) said something that offended Dale… something like that. We were all supposed to meet up on Saturday and have a great fun time at a local Gay Pride Festival, both Dale, Paul and Ronnie, plus several other people I know from my old neighborhood are gay. I guess it comes with the territory; Downtown Sacramento has a very strong Gay population. Any way, we were supposed to go to this festival tomorrow and now, because of what Ronnie said to Dale, Dale doesn’t want to go. I feel that this is entirely my fault because some how, like always, I got pulled in the middle of this. I had told Ronnie that Dale really liked him and that all he could do was talk about how nice and cute and such, on and on for the greater portion of an hour or so. I told Ronnie this because I thought that he should know that Dale had these feelings for him. I didn’t think that this was anything that Ronnie hadn’t figured out on his own.   Well anyway, so now I am in the middle of a dispute between my friend Dale and Ronnie, whom I have know for as long as I have know Jesse.   Damn it Jesse why did you have to go overseas, I need you now…. I don’t know what to do…. Help!!!  I think I am going to keep my mouth shut from now on.  *hummm mmhll mhhhee hmm hhiiinnnss mhhum mmuutt* That is, "we will see how things turn out"- with my mouth Shut :-)

       My life has been real busy lately. Work has been keeping me very busy and I am actually praying for a slow day today, which is unusually strange beings that it usually slow and I am usually praying for work to do.  The FRG meeting Tuesday night was very good, even though not that many people were able to attend. I nominated myself for a position as photo historian, which is an unofficial position that the FRG made up.  I figured that this would be a great position for me to have beings that: A) I always have my digital Camera with me B) I am going to be taking a Beginning Photography course next semester and this would be a great opportunity to practice.  I love taking pictures and it seems that pictures of FRG events are the only things the ARMY hasn’t found a way to regulate… yet. Any way the meeting went great and we were able to get a lot accomplished, at least in deciding on nominations for positions. So I feel that it really wasn’t a bad thing to have been a part of.  In other news, I got A’s in my two classes for this semester. I am so happy about that. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to recover from all of the time I had to take off due to out of state travel to see Jesse, 1 ½ weeks, then ½ week when my Grandmother/Nana passed away. 1 week when I got sick, so I was behind a total of 3 weeks in class. To top it all off I had to finish a total of 10 chapters of homework the last week I was sick But I managed to do it and I was very grateful and pleased in the end result of all of my hard work, A’s in both of my classes. Next semester I am taking on a total of 13 units, which is 4 courses. I haven’t pulled a full semester in a long time but I feel now is probably the time to do so. I love learning new things and now seemed like the best time to do so. I plan on surrounding myself in school and taking a little break here and there to earn a little income. My school schedule will take over most of my Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays so I will have Wednesdays and Fridays to work. I am also thinking of doing some sort of home based work but am having a hard time finding something that will actually be worth looking into.  My goal is to keep myself busy, not so that I don’t think of Jesse, but to help pass my time faster so that I can get through this time away from him a little easier.

       Well I guess it really didn’t turn out to be one of those days. I did get a chance to chat with Jesse a little bit this morning, which was very odd beings that they moved him to day shift therefore he shouldn’t have been up. Our chat was very brief but from what I had gathered from what he had posted, he was not having a good day either. I guess they had a big power outage at his camp and that was the reason he was working a double, they needed him to help get all of the equipment back online (Jesse if you read this please correct me if I am wrong on any of this information please).   Tonight is the must attend FRG meeting. I am looking forward to it and also very happy that I will be able to see people I haven’t seen in a while. I have noticed that as time slowly creeps on, the phone calls seem to get sparser and sparser. I am sure this is due to the fact that people have found things to keep them and their time filled, like I was with school. There is nothing wrong with that but I am often curious about how everyone is doing, but I also hate being the one who has to make/initiate the phone call.   Last week I was going through a few things I happen to have at my mom’s house that were overflow messes from the apartment that now lives in a stuffy old storage unit. I came across all of my piano/music books and a fresh, empty, sketch book with brand new color pencils. So I have decided to take up a few of my old favorite passions to help pass the time while I am out of school. Jesse was very happy to know that I was sketching again. I haven’t drawn anything in such a long time and I know that in not doing so I have let down Jesse and my mom, because I have stopped doing something that I have been told I am good at and although I am upset at myself for letting my mom down, I am even more so upset that I am letting Jesse down too. So knowing full well that he would be proud of me for starting up my art again, I have accomplished two things: 1)	I gave Jesse something to smile about 2)	I am building up a skill I have left dormant way too long The cool thing about this is that my sketchbook is small enough for it to fit on my scanner and I can scan all of my completed work for him to see.   Once again I applaud modern technology.  Other than that I have only fifteen more minutes until I get to leave work and go home to get something to eat, for some reason I am really hungry right now… I am also closer to going to the meeting that I really am looking forward too. Not because the major topic of discussion is going to be filling the positions, but also because it gives me a chance to interact with people who aren’t my family for even just a few short hours. No offense to my family but you all probably know exactly what I mean.  Well I guess I have detained your time long enough. Thank you again for reading this little extension to a military wife’s mind, and please make sure to come back and continue to show support.

       (This one is a little yucky in nature) I knew today was going to be one of those days before my alarm clock even went off this morning. I was very reluctant to get ready for work and the bus ride there seemed to last an eternity and its only 10:41 and I have only been at work since 10:00. My alarm was set for 7:00 am and I was rudely awoken by my mom’s jerk of a boyfriend because supposedly my cat “barfed” (in his words) all over the kitchen floor. Now even Jesse and my mom know it takes me a little while to get up in the morning, especially when someone and not my alarm are waking me up. So maybe 5 minutes later I am still in my bed trying to regain consciousness. Now My alarm clock is set so that the time is 15 minutes fast, so in actual reality it was probably 6:45 when he came back to my room and banged on my door for the second time… telling me this time he couldn’t get ready because of the cat barf all over the kitchen floor…. About 5 minutes later I finally get up, this time he is yelling at me from the kitchen… I get some shorts on and sluggishly drag myself into the kitchen to see what the big deal is about… I say all but 3 words to him “Where is it?” Looking around the room there was obviously not barf all over the floor… and he told me by the birdcage. So I walked over to the cage and sure enough there was a hairball, but not from my cat it was from my mom’s, just trust me when I say I could tell the cats are 2 different colors, any way I said to him, “This isn’t even from my cat it’s from Nash” and all he could say was “oh.” I cleaned it up and drug my butt right back into my room where I went back to sleep, waking up around 8:00. You see I haven’t been sleeping well due to my allergies/cold and the fact that it has been getting more and more like summer. I really didn’t need to start my day like that and I did wind up telling my mom all that had happened. I just can’t wait until this whole thing is over with because I am slowly but surely being reminded why I moved out in the first place, Mike. He is such a pain in my arse and I really do wish that he would just leave and never come back..  Well I am going to make sure that this is not how my blog will end today so I plan on writing again later, maybe at lunch.

           Today I am very glad it’s Friday, however could this Friday be going any slower? It sort of reminds me of a overused skit where someone is anxiously waiting for the clock to change its time to reflect the time in which they have to leave for the day but every time they look to the clock it has either remained the same time for what seems like hours or it feels like time is going backwards.                   Besides having to deal with my pent up anxiety over wanting to leave work already, my mind keeps on going back to this dream I had. I used to have this dream when I was younger, it always involved me being abducted and then thrown into the Bay. Or having problems with dealing with water, swimming, drowning, oceans, etc. I used to have a book about dreams but I misplaced it when I moved back to my mom’s house. I am sure it is somewhere in storage.                Descriptions taken from   urlLink Dreammoods.com          Water          To see water in your dream, symbolizes your unconscious and your emotional state of mind. Water is the living essence of the psyche and the flow of life energy.  It is also symbolic of spirituality, knowledge, healing and refreshment. To dream that water is boiling, suggests that you are expressing some emotional turmoil. It also may mean that feelings from your unconscious are surfacing and ready to be acknowledged.           To see calm, clear water in your dream, signifies that you are in tune with your spirituality. It denotes serenity, peace of mind, and rejuvenation.          To see muddy or dirty water in your dream, indicates that you are wallowing in your negative emotions. You may need to devote some time to clarify your mind and find internal peace. Alternatively, it suggests that your thinking/judgment is unclear and clouded. If you are immersed in muddy water, then it indicates that you are in over your head in a situation and are overwhelmed by your emotions.          To dream that water is rising up in your house, signifies your struggles and overwhelming emotions.          To hear running water in your dream, denotes meditation, reflection and pondering of your thoughts and emotions.           To dream that you are walking on water, suggests that you have supreme and ultimate control over your emotions. It may also suggest that you need to "stay on top" of your emotions and not let them explode out of hand. Alternatively, it is symbolic of faith in yourself.              Drowning           To dream that you are drowning, signifies that you are overwhelmed by emotions or repressed issues that is coming back to haunt you. You may be proceeding too quickly in trying to discover your unconscious thoughts and therefore must proceed more cautiously and slowly. If you drown to death, then is refers to an emotional rebirth.  If your survive the drowning, then a waking relationship or situation will ultimately survive the turmoil.           To see someone drowning in your dream, suggests that you are becoming too deeply involved in something that is beyond your control. Alternatively, it represents a sense of loss in your own identity. You are unable to differentiate who you are anymore.          To dream that you rescue someone from drowning, indicates that you have successfully acknowledged certain emotions and characteristics that is symbolized by the drowning victim.            Fall          To dream that you fall and are not frightened, signifies that you will overcome your adversities with ease.         To dream that you fall and are frightened, indicates a lack of control, insecurity, and/or lack of support in your waking life. You may be experiencing some major struggle and/or overwhelming problem. It may denote that you have failed to achieve a goal that you have set forth for yourself.         To dream that you are free-falling through water, indicates that you are feeling overwhelmed with emotions. You may feel that it is easier to give up then to try to stay afloat or prevent yourself from going under.        Running          To dream that you are running away from someone, indicates an issue that you are trying to avoid. You are not taking or accepting responsibility for your actions. In particular, if you are running from an attacker or any danger, then it suggests that you are not facing and confronting your fears.           To dream that you are trying to run but cannot make your feet move as fast as you want them to, signifies lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. It may also reflect your actual state of REM paralysis while in the dream state.          To dream that you are running alone, signifies that you will advance to a higher position and surpass your friends in the race for wealth. Alternatively, you may be running from some situation or from temptation.           To dream that you are running with others, signifies festive and prosperous times.           I guess when it all boils down I am having some issues with being overwhelmed by my emotions and it is effecting my life, my subconscious and conscious being.                    Right now as I am thinking about this I am becoming very exhausted, what ever is going on in my mind has obviously emotionally made me tired. I understand a lot of my emotion stress has to do with what is going on with my so called friends (please see the post from yesterday) and the fact that even though I am trying to let go of the bad situation, I am still being brought into something I don’t want to be brought into.                    I just want it all to go away and I don’t know how.                    God I wish there was a way to explain.

          Some people say time heals all wounds but I am beginning to think differently on this matter. I have learned that sometimes as time goes on, some things get progressively worse, feelings towards some people or certain events may feel like they have been left there solely to eat away at your being. Sometime unintentional actions cause things to worsen too and then you are left with more of a mess then were there before. Sometimes you just want to close your eye and make it all go away but you can only sleep for so long before waking up to the reality of the world and therefore you are forced to take these feelings and confront them head on.                These last few weeks I have been forced to confront some feeling I have been avoiding. I learned of some accusations from a family member of a friend of mine possibly stealing a large amount of money from them. It was very easy for me to believe these accusations were true do to the events that lead up to this event and here I was sitting at a table in my head and being forced to choose between my own flesh and blood and the word of two friends.                You see the Ironic part of this whole thing is that it too, like this entry, started with the words/ideas of “Some People Say” and I have decided from this point on that is also how problems develop, by these three words. Now I am not the leading authority on life and I pity anyone who thinks of me that way, after all how much can one 24 year-old be expected to know, especially when the person who supposedly based their life’s decisions on what was said, is over 10 years her senior. It is sort of sad when you think about it.               I live my life knowing that what is told to me by someone else is generally an opinion and there for your be taken lightly on all accounts, because after all its just an opinion. I would never expect anyone to base there thoughts and decisions on anything I may have said and then blame it on me when it backfires. After all it is just an opinion.                If I lived my life going by whatever anyone told me I would not be living my own life right now. I probably wouldn’t be married and I know I wouldn’t have a blog where I post my thoughts because I would have never gone online.               I don’t care who you are or how long I have know you for, the fact of the matter is if you can’t think for yourself and follow your heart and trust in yourself to make the right choices then you shouldn’t be in a situation where that should be an issue.        ve been forced to confront some feeling I have been avoiding.

So back to this table in my head, I have to choose between two friends and my own flesh and blood. The blood relation is more than one person; it is my Mother, my Big sister, my brother, my two Nephews and Niece. So given that, who would you choose?               I love my friends and hearing these accusations have lest my stomach in a twist and my heart torn, but no matter what my family will always come first and true friends would understand that.

       Today went fairly good. I started what I hope to be the first of many outdoor restoration attempts at my mom’s house, to explain, I am helping remove some ugly plants from the side of my mom’s house to make way for a nicer landscape. I am also looking forward to going back to school in around 3 weeks. I am looking forward to going back and spending my time learning new things. I am also contemplating quitting my job as a student assistant for a local state agency to work at a local shop/store so I can make more time for school but at the same time still be able to work to make a little bit of income. I was also considering seeing if I could get a job at the school I attend in their childcare center or in an after school program at a local elementary school, that way I can work part-time while I am at school and gain experience in a field I am interested in working in. In other news I am still very happy in hearing that Jesse will be able to come home in October. I know I keep talking about this but the fact of the matter is that knowing just enough to know he will get to come home is all I really need. It gives me something to look forward to that really means something, I mean the joy of a new school semester wares off after time but the knowledge of knowing that someone you love is soon to come home, even if it is for two weeks, that is joy that doesn’t fade, because after he has come and go I get to move onto the fact that he will only be away for a short time longer. I guess I would have to admit knowing that he is coming home soon is what motivates me to deal with everything life has to throw at me because I know it could be a whole lot worse then it is, I mean he might not be able to come home at all. But I don’t want to think about that.   Any way things are going ok all things considering and I guess my life is pretty good considering what changes Jesse and I have had to make. I always ask Jesse how things are there for him and he really tries to be as brief as possible by saying things like “ok” or, “eh, they could be better” and when I ask him why he says, “never mind” I guess he just doesn’t want to burden me with those types of things, but sometime he needs to vent and I hope he understands that I will always be here to listen or in most cases read his problems. This change in life for both of us has given us a new sense of understanding and a new found appreciation for the life that has been given to us and our relationship with each other and because of the plate that has been served to us, I now have a full understanding of what it means to truly love someone as much as I love Jesse.  &nbsp;That is my vent for tonight.

        I recieved this email from a friend of mine and although the email was very touching in nature this image was the most touching of them all. I wanted to share this with you. Text taken from the email that was sent to me.            "The proud warriors of Baker Company wanted to do something to pay tribute To our fallen comrades. So since we are part of the only Marine Infantry Battalion left in     Iraq     the one way that we could think of doing that is By taking a picture of Baker Company saying the way we feel. It would be awesome if you could find a way to share this with our fellow countrymen. I   was wondering if there was any way to get this into your papers to let the world know that "WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN" and are proud to serve our country." Semper Fi   1stSgt Dave Jobe            The attached photo was forwarded from one of the last     U.S.     Marine companies in     Iraq    . They would like to have it passed to as many people as possible, to let the folks back home know that they remember why they're there and that they remember those who've been lost. "

        I haven’t really had much to write although my life has been filled with enough things to tell. Earlier this week I received a package from Jesse containing a brand new laptop for my birthday. This actually wasn’t the highlight of my week though. The highlight of my week was finding out that Jesse would be able to come home on R&amp;R before the end of the year. We are not to sure of the exact dates yet and I am positively sure that I probably will never know the exact dates until I get a phone call from Jesse at the airport stating he is home and to come pick him up. Even now thinking about this makes me smile from ear to ear. It will do us both some good to be able to see each other, even if it’s only for 15 days because 15 days is better then nothing and I will take anything they (the ARMY) will give me.   I am currently working on sending another care package. So far I have a few things from his mom (a couple of computing magazines, a book and some Gatorade) I have put some candy and am currently waiting for some books to come in the mail to include. I purchased a complete series of Sci Fi books for him, which I am going to tell him to hold onto because after he is done I would like to read them. I also am going to put in a tiny keepsake I got when I went to Knottsberry Farm, it is something he can wear close to his heart and I know he will like it. My mom told me to let her know when I was ready to send my package because she wanted to bake some more for Jesse. So this next box is going to be filled to the rim with yummies and goodies for him.  In other news, my tattoo is healing up real nice. I am very happy with the way it turned out, and despite a few objections from my mom stating she felt it was too big, I am very happy with it, and that is all that really matters. School will be starting in a few weeks and I cant wait for that either, I am really looking forward to going back and it will defiantly help me pass my time away.  I feel like the FRG has pretty much dissolved which is very sad but I guess all you can do is be there for each other even in time when you aren’t needed. I am slowly getting through the next issue of the Signal Salute but I know it will be just as good as the first one. I still haven’t gotten anyone to volunteer to help out which is sort of disappointing but then again, I don’t really blame any of them, I don’t really want to do it either, but it’s the only thing linking me to the rest of the FRG and I will keep it going for as long as I have too.   Its just so sad.

         Out of rebellion and just not having anything else to do, Saturday I got inked. It turned out very beautiful and it is of something I hold very sacred. The tattoo is of the Celtic Cladagh with Trinity Knot cuffs. Although I am only 1/16 th  Irish, Jesse is ½ and I have always admired Celtic design so I felt this was an appropriate thing to have done. When I get a respectable picture of it I will post it, so far I haven’t been able to get any really clear pictures of it.    Jesse got back to his camp fine and is back to his normal working schedule. He thinks he will be hearing some news regarding his R&amp;R very soon, so I have my fingers crossed. I know I will have to give him back but I would be very satisfied with 15 days with Jesse all to myself. His leave release wont be until sometime after, during, or at the end of September which means I wont have to wait as long to have him come back for good. All I know is that is will be very nice to be able to have him back.    This morning he was connected to a server that allowed the usage of webcams. I was able, only for a little while, to turn mine on long enough to show Jesse my tattoo and for him to see that I was ok. He typed that I was so beautiful, and that really made me feel so good and I am sure he was very happy to be able to see my face.    Our time apart has given us a chance to talk more about things that we have never really had the time to talk about, and although I am unhappy that he is away, I cherish every conversation we have together while he is overseas. I feel that even though we have had such a close nit relationship ever since the first day we met, somehow we have managed to become so much more closer.  I guess sometimes you can find good in rotten situations.

       I have had a lot of unwanted stress placed upon me since Jesse has left. A lot of the time I wish he was home so I finally can have that shoulder I have so desperately needed to cry on.   I look at myself in the mirror and I don’t see what I am sure I should be seeing (a happily married woman) after all how can you be happily married when you aren’t with your spouse. I have talked to Jesse about this. Its not that I am regretting being married, believe me I am not, but I think that being married to someone and not having them there to hold and tell them you love them, every day, its so hard. I go to bed every night and wish so hard that when I wake up this was all a dream and I am back in my old apartment with Jesse sleeping next to me.   I have also taken this time to think a lot about how things are going to be when Jesse comes home for good. How strange it will be to be home and living in a house with your wife, and now her mother and her boyfriends as well. I know that we are not planning on being in my mom’s house for too long after he comes home but at the same time I hope that it isn’t too much for him to have to come back to our life together but having it change so much that he has to make a huge adjustment.   I guess its pointless to be worrying about these things now but after all when you have not much on your mind you tend to think about things that you really shouldn’t be concerning yourself with at this point in you life.

       Today was a fairly good day. I haven't talked to Jesse since last friday (my birthday) but I am positive that he is doing fine. He should be returning to his base camp within the next day or so and I am going to bug him for details of his stay at another camp. I hope that he is getting the care he deserves and needs. I will be sending him another care package soon, this time with a few items his mother gave to me to send him. &nbsp; The question was why couldn't she send the package to him, afterall she hasn't sent him anything since he has been gone, but I have come to the conclusion it has to do with the fact that she is dealing with her only son being overseas in her own way, which happens to be out of sight out of mind. Now Viki (Jesse's mom) and I have never gotten along that well but I did let her know that if she ever needed anything to call and I would be there for her. I know that she will never take me up on the offer, but at least she knows that dispite all that she has done to me and Jesse, I have chosen to be the bigger person because of the love I have for Jesse. &nbsp;

       Semi back to normal now, I am trudging along in my workday. Today is the first day I have been back to work since last Friday. Although I was very reluctant to come in today I also realize that since it is Wednesday, it also means that my workweek will be only 3 days long, so it really isn’t too bad, at least not yet anyway.   It was very nice to be able to get away from everything for a few days however when I came back, all of the stuff I ran away from, was still here waiting for me. I didn’t have the worse birthday but at the same time is could have been better. My friend Melissa took me out to dinner and I am pretty sure that my mom is going to do cake and ice cream for me this upcoming weekend since we were unable to do so on my birthday.   The trip was nice, despite the problems we had with my two nephews and their lack of listening skills. Saturday we arrived in Anaheim around 1:00 pm and got settled into our hotel room. Later that evening we went for a swim and then ordered out for Pizza dinner. The pizza place prided them-selves by claiming that they were the best pizza in all of California, I actually beg to differ (Pizza Guys will always be my personal favorite). Then Sunday we woke up and drove to Knottsberry Farm. It was ok there, I wasn’t too impressed although they had an Ice show called “The World According to Snoopy”, and the show was great. I didn’t get to ride too many rides but I figured that my day would come on Monday when we made our way to Disneyland. I rode a bunch of rides and even rode the Matter Horn for the first time ever. Then at the end of the day I watched in amazement as the closing fireworks lit up the night sky. In my head I was thinking about how beautiful it was and how I had wished that Jesse was there to see it with me. I think I want to go to Disneyland with Jesse when he comes home so we can watch the Fireworks litter the sky with glitter. The car ride home was very long and mostly all I wanted to do was sleep. My nephews got carsick a little bit in the beginning, but the rest of the drive home they were pretty good (as good as you could expect a 5 year old and a 6 year old to be after being stuck in a car for 6+ hours).   Well it’s a little before 2:00 pm here and I really wish I was at home. I am still very sleepy and for some reason I cannot snap myself out of it. I haven’t taken my medication for two days and I am feeling the effects of not taking it, so I have a feeling that is why I am so sleepy, that or I am still pooped from all of the walking I did these last 4 days.  I do have to say that Disneyland is a great diversion to thought, and I know part of me is still there.

       My birthday is going well so far. I awoke today in a fairly good mood, greeted my a “Happy Birthday” from my mom. Not more then a ½ an hour later Jesse called to wish me a “Happy Birthday” too. We had a really nice talk and he sounded so great. He told me he was sending something in the mail and that I should be expecting it soon, for my birthday. I told him he didn’t have to send anything because he bought me two small rings, one with my birthstone, that I wear all of the time. He told me that the rings were nothing and that I would really like what he sent me. So I hope it comes today that way I don’t have to wonder about what is in it (because he knows that will just drive me mad).  Today when I got to work my bosses Kathy and Lisa littered my desk with Birthday Confetti and a balloon and cards and a gift. It was really nice of them to do so. One of my coworkers gave me a gift certificate for La-Bou ( A local Bakery/Café). This was more than I had expected from anyone at work so you could imagine my surprise.  Also one of my Aunts called me and left a message at work and I got several well wishes/emails from people in the FRG as well as one of my online chat/email groups.  Per Jesse’s orders I am going out of town for the weekend. At first I was very reluctant to go but at the same time I know the time away from work and my normal everyday stresses, at least for 4 days, will improve my current outlook on my life. I do realize that this trip has been preplanned but I wasn’t too sure if I really wanted to go a week ago, so per Jesse’s orders I am going., he says I need it.  At 1:00 they are having cake for me and then at 2:00 I am heading home to finish my last minute packing for the trip.   I have a good feeling that this trip is going to be awesome and I get to spend it with two of my favorite little guys, my nephews Isaac and Jacob, not to mention my mom and her boyfriend Mike (who is also going because of his birthday [which is on the 13th]).   69 minutes to go… till I can leave work.

       I got to talk to Jesse a little bit this morning, but its been rough because my mom took the week off from work and was telling me to do a bunch of things before I had to leave for work, so I was running back and forth doing what I needed to do and what she asked me to do and tried to talk to Jesse at the same time. Jesse is doing good, as far as I can tell and they are keeping him busy enough so I am very happy for that, even though it interferes with our chat time.   The days get closer to me leaving for Anaheim with my mom, her boyfriend, and my two nephews. We are scheduled to leave Sacramento sometime around 6:00 am Saturday morning and are set to return sometime on Tuesday. We will be spending one day at Knots berry Farm (Sunday) and one day in Disney Land (Monday). I am so happy about going but at the same time I am not too sure I am going to be able to enjoy my trip because I know I will be thinking about Jesse, like I do so often.  Tonight my mom and I are going to Target to buy some snack foods and other things for the trip. I know once we get there I probably wont have time to even worry about how Jesse is doing but at the same time that is what I am afraid of. I know if Jesse were here he would tell me to go, enjoy my trip. He would tell me that I need to get away and I should treat myself for my birthday. I know deep down that’s what I should do, but at the same time I don’t understand how anyone can possibly have fun when they have been placed into a situation like I have.  I know all Jesse wants me to do is have a good birthday and to treat myself to a good time…but really all I want for my birthday is Jesse to be home.

       Today I went to visit my Nanu before coming into work. It was so nice to see him and I know it did him so good to see my mom and I. We spent about an hour and a half there and I have to say I really was reluctant to leave. It is still al little weird going over there and not seeing my Nana but I feel her all around me when I am there. I miss her a lot but I know that she is an angel now and she is watching over Jesse and making sure he stays safe.   When we got to my Nanu’s house we found him behind the house in his vegetable garden watering his squash. It was very nice to see him outside enjoying the cool summer day and getting some healthy exercise in. He gave us a few tomatoes and green bell pepper from his garden. I could smell the freshness of the tomatoes as I placed them in a bag to take home. I always loved the smell of fresh grown produce, not like the stuff you buy at a grocery store that has no smell. Anyway, you can understand then why I was reluctant to leave and come to work today. I remember when I was little how I would spend many hours and sometimes even days roaming around their property, looking at the livestock of rabbits, hunting dogs, chickens and several other types of birds. One time when I was in elementary school for show in tell I brought in a rooster from my Nanu’s farm. I was so happy that I brought it in because I was showing my classmates something they probably never even seen before, but all I could remember about the experience was how some kids would joke about letting it out and making fried chicken out of it. I remember taking the chicken home and telling it not to listen to the mean kids in my class, no one was going to eat him. Not more than a month or two later I came to find out that a coyote got onto his farm and killed a bunch of the chickens, mine was one of them. I know now that I should have never expected any animal that could be eaten that lived on my Nanu’s farm, wouldn’t eventually get eaten, be it by coyote or by one of my relatives.   Just thinking about this story makes me laugh.   In other news, communications have been slim with Jesse. Jesse has been kept fairly busy which I am glad but at the same time I do miss our chats. All I really want is him home or just time away from the computer, that way I don’t think about how much I really do miss him.   I wish I could travel back in time to when I was a kid on that farm… chasing chickens and petting rabbits… just for a little while.

       Today I am filled with feelings of missing, if that makes any sense? Being a woman I am going through my monthly imbalance of Hormones and I find that really all I want to do is go home and go to sleep. When I talked to Jesse earlier today and told him all I really wanted to do was go home and go to bed and he happily agreed. Seriously what I wouldn’t give just to have one night with him, holding me while I sleep, just like old times. Each day I push onward knowing that ones its over I can mark another day off my calendar. With each passing day, it brings me one day closer to having him home. I guess that is what drives me to get up in the morning and to face each day head on. It is also very comforting to hear Jesse say he feels the same way.  Today While I was listening to the radio I heard this song. I remember a conversation with my sister a few weeks back. She had told me whenever she heard this song it made her thing of Jesse and I. SO today I went in search for the lyrics to share with all of you. The song is a very beautiful one and I am thinking of trying to get a hold of the CD just so I can share this song with Jesse when he comes home.   BAND: Train ALBUM: My Private Nation: lyrics  SONG: When I Look To The Sky   When it rains it pours and opens doors And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love That have to say goodbye  And as I float along this ocean I can feel you like a notion that won’t seem to let me go  Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you’re here with me And you make everything alright  And when I feel like I’m lost something tells me you’re here with me And I can always find my way when you are here  And every word I didn’t say that caught up in some busy day And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn’t dance before And every sunset that we’ll miss I’ll wrap them all up in a kiss And pick you up in all of this when I sail away  Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly But with you I can spread my wings to see me over everything that life may send me  When I am hoping it won’t pass me by  And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me there you are to show me

       Happy Independence Day Everyone!!!  Today I am spending this holiday with my friends Melissa & Mihn, as well as my brother Michael and GF Candace. We are going to have a barbeque in a local park and I can't wait because it sounds so fun. So right now I am just waiting for my Brother to show up here so I can see him and Candace and possibly make our way over to Melissa's Apartment.   I spent the morning with my two nephews and my niece, it was great fun. I love seeing them. My Niece Elizabeth helped me make the potato salad for the Barbeque. It was so cute too see a little 3 year-old standing on the kitchen chair stirring the Mayonnaise into the salad. Every so often she would say “opps sorry auntie” when she stirred a little too hard and a little bit of the potato salad would go flying out of the huge bowl and land somewhere on the kitchen table. I wish someone would have been there to take a picture of her helping me. After I was done my oldest nephew wanted to sample the salad. He said it was very tasty, and smiled a wide little smile and nodded his head in approval of what he had just tasted.   It’s a little after 1:00 pm and I have just logged onto the internet not more than 5 minutes ago to see if Jesse was online and sure enough he is, he has about 30 minutes left until he is off shift though. He told me that they didn’t give them the day off for the 4th but then again that is understandable and most likely they were on high security due to it being an American Holiday. So now that I have given it some thought I understand completely.  Other than that, nothing else is new. Tensions have been high at home, but mainly due to the fact that I am hardly ever home. I think my mom is upset about the fact that I have been spending a lot of time with Melissa but for some reason I feel so comfortable there and I just seem to forget about the things that are bothering me. I guess it’s a place for me to hide out from the world.   Everyone needs to find that place every so often.

       Today I am in a very good mood, but I am not too sure of the reason why. Tonight I am going out to dinner with my friend Melissa for her Birthday; we are going out to eat sushi. I also get to meet a few of her friends which will be cool. I am looking forward to meeting new people and I know that I will fit right in with the group. These last few weeks I have discovered that I have a lot more in common with Melissa then I thought I did. I am very fortunate to have been able to build upon this friendship because I need to be able to be with people my own age and she is close enough to me where if I need her she is there.  In other news, because of the lack of signed Budget for the State of California, my hours have been reduced down to 20 hours a week. This has really placed a damper on my time with Jesse online (I usually would talk to him while we are both at work, just to pass the time a little quicker). Today he has been very busy with things to do, which I am glad because he isn’t bored and it gives him something productive to do with his time. To tell you how important Jesse is to me, I am complaining about how my time to talk with him has been shortened but I am not worried at the fact that my pay has been reduced due to the cut hours.   Other than that things are going ok. I finished the July Newsletter for the FRG, and I am very pleased at how it turned out and have been searching for things to put in the next issue. Still no word on whether Jesse will get to come home on leave or not, but like many things with the Military, you always know at the last minute. Take for instance when we found out that Jesse’s Unit was being mobilized, we knew all but 2 days in advanced and even then it was just an alert. They didn’t even confirm it until 2 days later when he showed up for his drill weekend and then his weekend turned into 2 weeks then 3 ½ weeks out of state and 3 months with his mobilization station to 12 months boot to ground in the middle east. Who would have thought that the Military was so good at utilizing the element of surprise?

         the world is not so big BY:Danielle   Looking to the sun, Tomorrow its is yours, You pass to me the stars And I can almost smell you in the air, But only if I try really hard.  Lying on the grass, 8000 miles is so far away, But when I think of how just hours before  You saw what I was looking for.  The world doesn’t seem so big, When I look to our star.

       Tonight, because I need it, I am taking a girls night out with my friend Melissa. I am looking forward to the time with her. She has been such a good friend to me and I am forever grateful for having her around to talk to. I haven’t had a girl friend like that in a long time. I feel so comfortable whenever I am around her and I know even if I need to escape the world as we know it, I can always count on her to hide me.   Today I spoke to Jesse on the phone, it is always such a pleasure talking to him and I really hope that they let him come home on R&R real soon. I have had lots of time to consider the fact that if he does come home on R&R it’s not for good and he will have to go back. I just miss seeing his face and looking into his big brown eyes. I can tell by our conversations that he hasn’t changed a bit and I am thankful for that because one of my concerns was that being over there would change him, his personality. I think what keeps him close to home is being able to talk to me and what keeps me going some days is knowing I will get to talk to him.  I have noticed that there are a few benefits to this whole situation, we have become more sensitive to each other’s needs and concerns and have become more in tuned to each other. Before he left we had hit a rough patch in our relationship, we were very stressed due to work and hardly got a change to spend time together because we worked opposite schedules.  And although he was taken away from me for his noble service overseas, I have been able to see the sunny side of my gloomy days. I know that his time over there will give him the work experience he needs to excel in the Tech field, also teach him skills of responsibility and safety, among other things loyalty and commitment. I know that when he gets home we will be able to start the life we have been struggling to start before his tour of duty. We have all of these dreams and aspirations and I know when he comes home it will be my turn to take care of him and help him reach his goal of working in the computer/networking field.   Jesse hasn’t been home since late November 2003. He started his tour of duty early last March 2004 and is expected to return home sometime next March 2005.   4 months Overseas down and 8 left to go… and counting.

       I caved and am spending the night at Melissa's, I don't know what I would do if I didn't have her as a friend.  Right now I am fighting the need to sleep, partly because I don’t want to go to bed, and partly because I want to stay on as long as Jesse is on shift so in a sense we can go to bed together.  Tomorrow, or shall I say later today, I am going to make the long trek to school and buy my books for the new semester. Then after that I am going to meet up with Melissa, Minh and their friend Bryan and go see the movie "The Village". It has been forever since the last time I went to see a movie in the theater, so I can't wait.  Other than that I think the majority of my weekend will be spent cleaning and doing laundry.  But I seriously can think of worse things to do.

       Sometimes you have to wonder, what are we all here for? I like to live my life in a routine of sorts. I like to know what I have to do, when I have to do it and stuff like that. But as I sit here and wait for the last minutes of my workday to end I find that I am very anxious to leave, knowing full well I have nothing really to go home to. Tonight I am not going to visit Melissa although I am sure after an hour at home I will most likely change my mind. Lately the people in my household have been under a lot of stress and have been taking it out on everyone else and I personally don’t want to be a part of that anymore. I actually would like to be able, for one night, to come home and be able to veg-out without someone yelling at me to do something. I think that is why I like going to Melissa’s place, because I know it will be ok just to sit and do nothing, although I find I am always asking her if I can help her with anything, maybe because I know she will inevitably say no.  I had a great visit with my Niece on Wednesday and I have to say I would love to do that again with her real soon. I also got to see a few people I haven’t seen in a long time and that did me some good. I told Eileen (my old manager when I worked at the Zoo Gift Shop) that I was thinking about working on the weekends and she told me to come back in the spring and she would see what she could do for me. I don’t know if that is where I want to end up again but it’s a start.  I also start school in a week, which I cant wait for because I know that is the out I have been desperately looking for. I know it will be a big change but I need to be somewhere where learning consumes me and all I can do is focus on what I am attempting to learn.  Well, its time for me to wrap this thing up for now, quitting time, YIPPY!   But I may be back later tonight… If the spirit moves me.

          Tomorrow is probably going to be the best day I will have this week. I am going to take my niece Elizabeth out for a day at the Sacramento Zoo. I am looking forward to it and hope that she is as excited as I am about the whole thing, although I don’t expect her to be because she doesn’t know what we are going to do yet (she thinks she is coming over tonight for a Pajama party). I also hope that Jesse will be online tonight because I want to show him how big Elizabeth has gotten. I am thinking maybe there will be a photo booth at the Zoo and we can have two pictures made that way I have one and she can have on of her with her Auntie.                These last few weeks have been really slow at work and for that I am semi grateful because it has given me some time to do some things at work that I haven’t had the time to do, like catch up on some reading and talk to some friends I haven’t been able to talk to in a long time. I have also had a little more time to talk to Jesse while he is on shift.               I start school in two weeks and I am so not ready to go back but at the same time I can’t wait to get the creative juices flowing in my head again. I know that going back to school will help me pass my time although I am not to sure what I am going to do about the work situation but I have figured I will take that in stride and see where life takes me.               I have talked to Jesse off and on the last few days and he seems ok, I know it did him a world of good getting a timeframe for his R&R and I know that probably did wonders to boost his moral. I can’t wait till he gets to come home because I miss him so much. I have decided that I want to stay at this new Marriott hotel on the River for the first few days he is home. I know everything is going to be wonderful when he comes home and even thinking about this now makes me smile from ear to ear.                There are a lot of things you tend to miss when you aren’t constantly around the person you love. It is funny; sometimes I even miss the annoying things Jesse would do. Right now I could safely say I would give anything just to have him home for good.               Anything!
