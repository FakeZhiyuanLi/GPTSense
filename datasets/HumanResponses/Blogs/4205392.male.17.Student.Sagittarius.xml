      At long last the bus is about to leave. There's something awesome about Chinese people -- I just got kicked out of my nice spacious seat to spend the rest of the bus ride by people I don't know in the back entirely because of two elderly Asian ladies (Yeah, I couldn't really refuse...my mom and dad were in the next seat over and there's this whole "respect your elders" Asian culture thing). The tour guide just gave us an introduction in a heavy latino accent which I very much doubt anybody here understood, but at least they did make good use of the phrase "Thank you", which is perhaps the only shred of English they know. I love America.

      It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of being called a chink. I've been called many things in the South -- a kid even came up to me once, clasped his hands together solemnly, bowed slightly and said "how". Apparently the racial separation between Native Americans and the Asiatic peoples is less distinct than I thought. Anyway, I went down into the lobby of our splendid Super 8 motel to get some watery coffee with my mom and dad. We went outside, wandered to a nearby convenience store, sipping coffee and feeling the hot wind blow across our faces. A truck came by, big bass beating. "Chink!" Some muscular guy in a wifebeater shirt shouted at us. The truck had about 5 people in it -- a blonde girl excited by the lights, sounds, and sights and a couple of guys in the back laughing uproariously at the wifebeater's clever and witty use of rhetoric. IT really is the end of the line when your only excitement is driving around drunk in Idaho, shouting chink at passing Asian tourists. I half considered taking a picture but decided against it, realizing that the wifebeater could easily tear my limb from limb and very likely had the inclination to do so out of sheer spite.   On a separate note, I had a nice chat over the phone with one of the former Magnet Elite. Like me, he also moved shortly after Freshman year. It's really really cool to meet someone who has gone through the same struggles you have with moving, adjusting to alien cultures, eating ramen with ice cream, discovering the use of asyndeton, etc. I gotta stop writing before I get all choked up...

      I'm not one to flout my (lack of) manliness, but I did just eat a bear. In soup form. It tasted like mushroom soup, and by the time I got to it, there were only microscopic bear particles left, but notwithstanding embellishing things is always fun. "And it was this big  ". Yup. I even had to fight it mano a ma..eek! A SPIDER!

      We're in Idaho now. Nothing that great to see, but there was this trucker lady in the truck stop taht gave me ice cream (This is actually serious, guys!) I dunno if I've been tainted with ideas of nice truck stop people from Grapes of Wrath, but there was something quiet and stoic about the lady that just made me pause as she scooped up ice cream fo rme. She is like the mountins here...a bit large, somewhat formidible, probably here for years upon years, working tis lonely truck stop serving truckers thier black coffee and tourists their ice cream. THere was something about the lady that just really did make me feel like a little farmerboy. I'm 17 yeasr old, but I really don't know anything about anything that really matters. When she gave me my ice cream, I said "Thank you m'am." She kinda smiled.

      My dad woke me up at the ungodly hour of 3:30 AM, when the sleep gnomes still reign over th night and traffic lights change as soon as you drive by trhem. Things were pretty uneventful until I reached the security check at the airport -- I put my Rubik's Cube in the little tray, and after I passed through the X-ray machine on the other side, I saw one of the security guards cubing with a passion. Schweet!

      It's Friday, and I just realized that tomorrow, I'm going off to a fun filled week to various parts of the Western US. Of import are Salt Lake City, spawning ground of Mormons, SCO, and Orrin Hatch (all of whom I despise with a passion), Yellowstone (outdoors), and South Dakota (somewhat smelly according to the Simpsons). Although it seems as if I'm very reluctant to go on this trip, I'm actually quite excited. Originally, I thought that I would have to spend hours outdoors, communing with nature to the point where I would be able to understand why earthquakes were slowly breaking apart Northrend, but instead, I get to meet the enemy (trees, everything in Utah, Holiday Inn) FACE TO FACE. So, for the ones of readers out there, don't despair! I'll be back in a week, probably with a rapid flurry of posts and/or pictures. Tally ho!

      As a firm democrat who is generally opposed to the Governator in general (well, with the exception of  urlLink his ridiculous ownage of opponents ) , it was a pleasant surprise to see that he's got some things going right. That's right folks, California is considering Open Source! Although the proposal for Open Source comes primarily out of a desperate need for money, it's a good first step that may someday challenge the Microsoft Hegemony. Of course, I'm not one to mention irony of the Governator trying to destroy the mindless, robotic killers driven by Sky...err Dot Net...  One has to wonder though: What will happen to Microsoft if it someday loses power? With 50 billion dollars in reserve, how can Microsoft even fall? An image of Bill Gates springs into my mind, resting peacefully in his office when suddenly a bright red light starts flashing, sirens blare, and Gates makes the call to Ballmer to press that magical red button that will immediately channel funds to key parts of the company. Will I respect Microsoft less than SCO then? Will they stop producing those phenomenal keyboards and mice? What will happen to Halo (*shiver*...life without halo)? Will Steven Jobs immediately cease to exist, the only goal binding him to existence in the mortal realm gone? No matter what, I think it'd be worth it just to see the face of Bill Gates as he sees his immoral ways, etched forever into the annals of history. March forth Linux! To quote Eric S. Raymond, Open Source Advocate,  "The sinister plan for world domination is right on schedule".  May the source be with you!

      Although my political views clearly lean away from Bush and (as a result) towards Kerry, I must say that I have the utmost respect for Senator John McCain. There must be something clearly wrong when McCain, who I believe actually possesses moral fortitude, starts to speak out against challenging Kerry's military career. I wholeheartedly agree with the Daily Show's tribute to Kerry ("He's NOT Bush"), and although I do not believe Kerry is a great leader, I think that McCain makes a very good point in telling both sides to stop the mud slinging. I mean, it's like dissing a guy's car, desktop, or computer in general. That's just wrong.

      [rant] There's something about internships where you're clearly being exploited to do crappy grunt work, such as watering rabbits and taking out trash, that leads me to rant and rave angrily against the system. Although it makes me feel warm and bubbly to understand how Marvin the Paranoid Android of Hitchhiker fame feels, ("Here I am, brain the size of a planet..."), it's more than annoying that I was lured here under false pretenses of learning how to sysadmin and network, only to click points on a map indicating where gas stations are in Palos Verdes. Furthermore, what I do is clearly labeled out in a far more efficient manner on Yahoo Maps, and the data I am inputting will very likely be used by less than a hundred people. So here's my ultimatum to you, PV on the Net. Give me a decent computer and a decent task, and I'll join your forces with the utmost loyalty. Otherwise, be prepared to spend hours trying to guess a password after I am safely several hundred miles away. [/rant]

      [rant] I've recently come across massive problems in various fonts involving commas which look exactly the same as periods. As a result, my poor addled brain, usually deprived of sleep and not that powerful to begin with, rereads the statement created with a comma in it, and instead comprehends the peaceful speed bump of text that should be there as a full blown stop sign, wasting seconds of precious thought. It's not an important thing, but then again, it's not a hard thing to fix either. So get it together Slackware and gaim! I have faith in you!! [/rant]

      I just came back from watching Friends with some...friends. I still hold the position that social activity requiring physical movement of any sort is massively overrated, unneccessary, and also redundant. However, I did get a couple of laughs, and more importantly, I made my first journey that was potentially more than a mile in distance by driving a car. Yes, be afraid America, for I never listened during driver's ed, I cannot see very well in general, and I am ASIAN. Although I have yet to  urlLink break laws of physics  I am confident that my driving can break ANY rule. And yes, now that I'm driving and visiting people outside of my house, the universe is two steps closer to ending. Don't worry though...I'm still staying far, far away from guitar and surfing...

      Once again, the boredom of the summer, in conjunction with tedious and (for the most part) fruitless work at PV on the Net has compelled me to further falsify my thoughts to everybody with an internet browser. Though I hate the concept of blogging in general, the manliest man I know (Jeremy) and the geekiest guy...ever (Casaburi) have both recently started blogging, thus, by a combination of blogging and the transitive property, I can simultaneously be geeky and manly. For all the 1s of readers out there who may actually see this, I applaud you for returning back to the disguised mass emails that all of you so gallantly tried to avoid, then to filter, then to outright reject from your mail server to prevent server overload and blatant destruction by stupidity. That's all for now...it's a cloudy overcast day in lovely PV, giving me a chance to go outside without melting into a vampiric puddle. Not that I will (go outside), but hey, the option is available.

      We're here...the land of the enemy. As I write this, I'm trying to wipe the peach juice on this page that appeared subsequent to the smashing of the aforementioned peaches which were placed (unbeknownst to me) in my carry-on by my parents. Typical. On the flight, I learned a little bit about curry, Yellowstone, and the deliciousness of Coca-Cola. Here we go! Prepare yourself Daryl McBride, Orrin Hatch, and [Supreme Overlord of the Mormons]. Daniel Chen has arrived in Utah!

      I hate zoos. THe whole idea of looking at enslaved animals within fake environments lost its appeal for me after Planet of the Apes -- the orignal one, not the crappy new one. This visit was even better than normal visits to the zoo because I got to see Asians frantically puttering about, shooting pictures with wild abandon. They were a lot funner (shut up. it's a word) to observe than the bears who, for the most part, boredly gazed at us with drunken expressions. It's still my contention that naming bears "Rosey" or whatever is incredibly dangerous in the way it humanizes wild animals that can easily crush your car into an aluminum can, but on the other hand, it sure is funny to hear Asians trying to pronounce Rosey while nodding in understanding at what must be, to them, cryptic remarks of the English-speaking tour guide.
