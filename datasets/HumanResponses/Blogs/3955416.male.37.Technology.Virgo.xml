      So it has finally come to pass... We are in the new house. It was a move and a half, There were no serious glitches in the move, it just took alot of time and effort. The new house is nice and we are just getting settled in. We have decided to give the kids the big bedroom and we will get the smaller two fro us. One will be the office. There are alot of little things that need to be worked on but it will get done over time. I set up part of the network last night and we will be getting our Internet set up in a few days.   Just testing some stuff:    urlLink HTML Dog

      It is only a few days left before the move.  &nbsp; We were running shot of boxes last night. Never seems like that much stuff before you move. I know that I will be sitting down and sorting alot of stuff to get it on the PC soon. I hope to do this over the winter. I also want to get a server built to house the growing collection of pics we have. Katrine is taking alot of pictures. The house is starting to seem empty with alot of things packed. I liked the house but it never had the feeling of a Home. I hope that after all has settled down in September we can make the place feel like Home.

      Well, it is Sunday and I am awake early. The Kids are asleep and I am just surfing Fark.com. We had a good night over at Nicole's and got home late. Jazz took some really great pics of the girls and the sunset and some flowers. We are getting anxious about moving next weekend. We will be packing today and doing some prep work.    One thing we have to get done is change all the lights and get the fans down. I highly recommend changing to the compact flourecent bulbs. We have saved a ton of cash with them. I hope to bring all my old computer stuff to That Computer Guy. He does work for the economically disadvantaged who need a computer or need one serviced.    Katrine just woke up. She yelled out for Daddy to come get her. She is waking up now, I let her watch the movie she rented last night, Cinderella II. I think the rest of the house is waking up. Time to go.    Have a good day.

       Well I now have Internet access at the new house. I have the basic network set up. Things are coming along at the house. We have discovered a huge   urlLink  Bald-faced Hornet    nest on our house. We will have to wait for the winter to deal with that one. The garden and the flowers have been transplanted and should do well. We have had a cool summer and that will help. We have met most of the neighbors and they are great. Quite the variety, lots ok kids. Katrine and Ziazan will have many new friends.     We get to see Grandma Nicole more often. The street is quiet and not many cars. I have a bit of a longer walk to get the bus, but I could lose some weight. I have started to fix up the mountain bike and will soon bike to work. I am looking forward to that. I have to get the rear wheel done tonight. Monday I hope to bike in.
