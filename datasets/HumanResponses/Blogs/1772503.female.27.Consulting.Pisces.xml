      i dun like to wait. i dun like to sit n sulk. i dun like to put my own happiness in other ppl's hand. i dun wan others to control how they can make me feel... i dun like. i dun like becoz i'm scared of losing. i'm scared of losing to others, of losing out to myself, to declared i'm defeated.  i gotta be strong. i have to.

      sometimes, don't you think, it's reali tired to be the one taking initiative all the time.   i think i'm getting tired... but i stil love them. i stil love my friends. so what if i'm tired? i know i'll stop making the first move to call n gather them only when i dun care anymore. sigh... back to square one. i care.   xmas is coming. i wan to meet a lot more friends, but, i hope i had more substance in my bank account man. there's a lot more places i want to go nex yr, i think i better do something abt it ...  rating for the day: 4 stars of 10. as moody as the weather.

      had a meeting w my new director for operations today... something he said struck me .. and i wan to record this down and share it: he say when a worm's growing to a larva, then to cocooning itself before becoming a butterfly, it hv to squeeze itself out of it's shell? ... if ever someone's to go prick the shell or cocoon open, the larva wil not grow muscles and fly... the process of struggle n squeezing is essential for it to grow, so that i'll eventually become a beautiful butterfly n fly high..  i think...i'll squeeze thru too...i'll.

      In office now - was feeling a bit .. not so balanced lo. Think i better:  1) improve myself - read a lot of books, gain alot of knowledge, so tht I know how to handle situations and be more confident!!   2)or be a goody-2-shoes: stay lovely and take all the SHIT I need not to.. not tht i'm being bully or wat.. jus tht my indecisive character has not brought me very far. I need to pick up good good good negotiation skills, be firm and get things done!   ...AARRRGGHHH!!! wat the hell is taking pl in me now? so frustrated! ... can feel the my sleeve spliting and my throat turning green n thick..!  hulking ..
