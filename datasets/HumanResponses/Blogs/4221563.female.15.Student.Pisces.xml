      Dylan's playing my guitar obnoxiously loudly on my amplifier- I might have to shoot him. He just plays the same little riff ten times over, with the effects pedal on 'ignorant metal music'.  Honestly, he has no respect for the instrument.   Today wasn't the best day. Science, Japanese, English and History- and neither Lauren nor Cassie turned up. We watched an educational video (the bane of my existance, should be burned ala Nazi regime) first period - 'Twas so boring I gave up halfway and read. Belinda thought she'd be nice and sit next to me in Jap, and, aside from trying to convert me to loonism, she wouldn't shut up. She just doesn't stop talking. It's really quite painful.   We got our creative writing assessments back- marked by the freaky-loony-weirdo. I got full marks, but she reckoned it was clinched. Shucks for her, I guess. People probably think I'm whacked for getting angry when I got a good mark, but I don't particularly care about the marks- I want to write stories that people'll like, not make them go 'blah, may as well watch Home and Away, it's the same stuff'.  So yes. My rant done for the day.   Liz got angry at lunchtime, about the Lauren thing. Sherry/Wendy brought it up, and we got into a discussion about it. I basically said that I don't really think it's fair to get angry about the kssing Milo thing- that's just lauren. It's part of her personality, just like the way someone does their hair is part of theirs. It's kind of like...discrimination. Or something. It's too trivial, anyway.   Japanese exams on this Friday and next Thursday...have to start studying if I want to do okay. Which I do. Sigh. Everything's just annoying. And everything I write sounds like crap.  I hate that.  Will probably do bugger-all tonight, play tetris and read Mockingbird and go to bed at nine. Have I told you how much I love that book? I'm looking for the movie, no one seems to have it. This is my third go reading it, will probably end up buying a copy (instead of theiving it off the school) and reading it another sixty times.  Love it to death.

      If you count the seven hours after school on Friday, I've had twenty one and a half hours of weekend that haven't been punctured by sleep. total bottles of water consumed: 3 total movies watched: 2 number that were decent: 1 Number of albums listened to: 6 Number of labels stuck to super glue: 1250 total homework done: 1 essay, and only because I wanted too.  So yes. It's been a completely unproductive two days. Homework wise, I've got about four maths exercises to do, a whole lot of Japanese stuff plus a test to study for, and Geography work. And I don't care. Ee-yah!  Wanna read my essay? It's riveting, that much is for sure.   TWELVE ANGRY MEN, POLITICS AND PREJUDICE. ‘Prejudice Obscures the Truth’

      Something for Kate is probably the band that made music real for me. I love all their records to death, and the most exciting thing to happen in my sad little life was seeing them play for the first time.  There's this internet forum/community thing full of SFK fans who, if you ask me, border on obsessive. I read it occaisonally, because it's damned hilarious. Anywho, Clint, the band's drummer, was on Girl TV for five minutes about two months ago. The forum has this huge discussion raging about how the band are Sellouts and their new albums are Utter Crap (because people actually like them).  I thought this post was mildly amusing: "I must admit, I was surprised when they said they had an interview with Clint but I didn't see anything wrong with them being on that program.Perhaps everyone who watches it wears hoop earrings and hot pants ... I don't know ... but who cares? They probably think the way you dress is amusing. And you can't assume that just because they don't dress/act like you they are not worthy enough to be SFK fans, nor like them as much as you do.Girl TV isn't clubbing baby seals ... Clint wasn't advertising his new clothing label ... the interview was completely focused on the band and him as a drummer. "  Clubbing baby seals, hehe. But seriously, it's like they're debating whether or not depleted uranium should be dropped on Cuba.

       Okay- So school this week was horrible. I'm not entirely sure why- it just was. I'm starting to think I've 'outgrown' school, but the thought scares me. It's like breakfast cereal- if you eat rice bubbles two years straight you wake up one morning and realise you can't think about rice bubbles without throwing up.    Same with me and School.       I feel like I'm ready to become my own person- ready to live my own life. I'm sick of having to listen and conform to the rules of people I don't like and never will like. I'm sick of coming home with headaches because I've spent the day with a bunch of idiots who have no respect for themselves or anyone else. I'm sick of people looking at me weird, sick of doubting myself, sick of everything.    Just sick.       I'm sure Lauren is avoiding me and I'm sorry about that. Sometimes, I feel like she's being degradory to me and that's why I moved in maths- but I never wanted lunch to turn into a slinging fest. That was wrong and I truly regret it. We all do.       Friday afternoons aren't meant to be like this. I'll be home alone (besides from Dylan, who doesn't count) for the entire night, save a few hours after five. I wonder if Majah will let me rent movies. I need something to stop me thinking.    My English teacher thinks I'm a freak, I've decided.       I've got to write an essay. 'Prejudice obscures the truth'. I would love to be dangerously edgy and say that Prejudice maketh the truth- but I'm not sure I believe that and therefore would only be doing it to shitstir.    Shucks for me.       *   Will Bloom: A man tells so many stories, that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal.    - From Big Fish.

      Think Lauren isn't talking to me. Think I really pissed her off. Sorry for that.

      I thought this one knows better than I do...  I feel weird. I think I'm cruising towards another 'life is horrible' phase, and I don't what to feel like that again. School gets me down. I have very little work to do, but I feel like I'm a lazy shit who does bugger-all. Maths is horrible- I attempted to finish 10P today, but no luck. It just doesn't stick.  My yo-yo's stuffed. Someone knotted it at the axle so it doesn't spin properly. I'm sad. I'll have to buy another one. That was about the most exciting thing about school today- my yo-yo. I still felt sick, and kind of drowsy with the medication mum fed me. We watched Twelve Angry Men in English- the new version totally wrecked the best scene, and the Eighth juror is old. Really old. And I can't get the whole 'Grumpy Old Men' thing out of my head.  I came home from school dead tired and fell asleep. I had this really weird nightmare, someone was trying to eat me, except I couldn't see who, and I was running, but I wasn't moving. The usual stuff, except I was wearing a gorilla suit. Explain that, quacks!  Seeing as I have nothing else of importance to say, I may as well be on my way.  It's Evolution Baby...

       I'm sick. I'm not sure why- but I'm here, sick.    It's not the best thing in the world.       It's two-twenty-four (refer to the trusty time-date metre if you don't believe me), and I've been home for just under an hour. In science, I could barely write, so once I'd gotten my geography assignment (thirty-nine/forty, Brunsie can't spell 'your'), I went to sick-bay and they a-called my next of kin.       Carney gave me a prada ring! It's so pretty. It's silver, and it says PRADA. It's on my chain, because rings on fingers make me nervous. I always think they're going to get caught in something and rip my entire hand off.    But that's just me.       The Japanese thing was funny. I was so damn nervous for nothing, I guess. Japanese people are nice. Not one of them looked at me weird- props to them for that. Year eleven did about half a million solos (one of which was about elvis' pelvis and was completely embarrassing), and Year Eight danced to 'Hey Mama'.    Shocking, just shocking.    We took Michiko and the little one up and down in the lift- much to their delight.    So yeah. I really want to go to Japan next year now. I've just got to work on the whole 'god, i'm in an aeroplane, I'm going to die' thing, and I'll be right.       **   Bob: I don't want to leave.   Charlotte: So don't. Stay here with me.

       Me at the moment: Just finished Geography (Mauritius research, just fantabulous), The Whitlams on media player, Lorenzio buzzing on MSN. Shoes with funky new day-glo laces, purple vest, orange shirt. Hair being annoying.  Woolworths last night- came away with new shoelaces, a new pen and jellybeans. Saw- A man dressed in red ski wear, buying tuna and shaving cream. He kinda looked like Moses- I decided he might have just returned from being stranded atop a wintry mountain, or about to depart on a flight marked ‘Alaska’. Either way he really likes tuna. There was a boy in a faded Ramones T-shirt who bought nothing but lurked around the frozen foods section, and an Indian family with a little girl in a gold dress. Her mother couldn’t decide which toothbrush to buy- and was oblivious to the fact the little girl was slowly taking toothbrushes off the rack and dropping them into the trolley one by one. One middle-aged guy in white painter’s jeans who looked like he could either be a regretful bachelor or a tied-down husband. I checked his basket- two loaves of no name bread and a razor- and decided on the former. I had fun.    News that will most likely have an effect on any upcoming events: Cassie has the net. This is bad for two reasons: MSN is no longer safe and any extra time spent in Cassie's presence isn't so good at the moment. Hmm. Will have to ponder this further. What's worse- Her msn screename is pulled straight from Missy Higgins' "Scar" (imagine my shock/disgust). Terrible.  I did have more to write- but I'm blank now. We went shopping again today (I'm starting to think we're addicted). I wandered around for ages, attempting to find Wendy a present. Came up with zilch so ended up getting her a voucher from HMV. I bought a yo-yo.  Sigh. Cassie's online. It's so weird. There's the net world, and the real world, and Cassie belongs solely in the real world. The lines should never cross- it gets too weird.  Mum's not very happy today. Dad's home, he dislocated something in his back and then kept working and so can barely walk. All he's done is wander around being stroppy about his pathetic life. Dylan keeps suggesting things they could do together, like watching the Rolling Stones DVD we bought him for his birthday (in July) that he is yet to watch. Dad doesn't want to do any of it. Hence, Mum's pissedness. She gets sick of reassuring Dylan that Dad does love him.  I don't know. I no longer care about having a relationship with my father- I don't know him, never have known him. The last meaningful conversation we had was conducted with him clawing at my door attempting to 'break my head in'. There's always been something more important than me with him- usually it's work, but sometimes it's his own issues. I still remember when he called me over, looking like he'd just seen his own death, and told me he'd been badly abused as a child. I don't know the man's favourite food, but I know all about his fucking childhood hang-ups. What am I meant to think? Sigh. Having him around makes me angry. I haven't told anyone, but I prefer it when he's not here. He gives bad vibes.  This song...is off SFK's Echolalia- the first time I heard it I thought of my father.  Jerry Stand Up- Something For Kate  jerry stand up pull back the curtains and let some light in quit your job because you hate it and it's wasting you.  once upon a time you were running singing to the ground every morning once upon a time you were  jerry stand up am i the only one who's noticed that you've been missing remember yourself man remember that you have chance and possibility once upon a time you were running singing to the ground every morning once upon a time you were crazy  jerry you're not getting any younger all you need is fresh air a nice new suit and a walk in the park every day or two every day in every way(repeat chorus)

      Saturday nights are always no-shows for geeknerds. We sit around, usually near a peice of overpriced technology, and while away the hours doing geeknerdish things like cross-stitching or playing tetris.        For me, Saturday nights usually mean strange conversations with Lauren via MSN, the odd attempt at writing the Great American Novel (take note; Hemingway), packet stirfry and Law and Order repeats on Pay TV (god wouldn't have invented reruns if he didn't like cable). I think the Willowbark was off.  Right now- it's almost six, (m)(f)(br)- ajah are having a family orientated conversation about Majah's impending re-entrance into the workforce (She recieved a 'top-secret tip off' she got the job at 0900 hours), and I'm sitting here waxing lyrical about my lack of a social life.  Last Night: Practised my Japanese speech until Dylan told me to 'shut up with the gibberish' , and then settled back for a long night in front of the box.  Matchstick Men  was ma-ma (Jap for okay)- nice storyline/characters, but with an extremely dry ending. Went to bed at Eleven (gasp, Lorenzio, at the lateness of the hour!) and saw flowers on the ceiling.  This morning: Watched  Hiroshima,  a three-and-a-half-hour made-for-television-and-'exclusive'-DVD-release spectacle meshing real footage and testimonials with a movie about the lead-up to the atomic splatting on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Spent the next four hours lurking in doorways, convinced someone was going to drop a nuclear weapon on my head.  While I'm talking movies, here's my favourites-of-the-minute-in-no-particular-order: -American Splendour (Docu-drama about Cleveland comic book star Harvey Pekar) -Lost in Translation (Set in Japan, Bill Murray unintentionally becomes my hero) -About a Boy (Just watch it) -Almost Famous (great soundtrack, Patrick-leading-man-can't-remember-last-name is so cute)  Sigh. I have to end this quickly- I've got to accompany Majah to the supermarket on a quest for stirfry vegetables in a packet (what makes them different from normal vegetables? Have they been coached in stirfry ettiquette?). This is phase one in my geeknerd night: An hour at Woolworths, perusing the frozen meals section. If I'm lucky, I might by a new pen and a packet of Mr. Glucose's all-natural-but-still-flavourtastic jellybeans. Damn, I'm good.  LORELAI: What do you call a dog with no legs? (silence) LORELAI: You don't--he's not gonna come anyway. -Thanks for that, Lorenzio, it brightened my day.

      Excellent.  Snapshot of this here Friday night: Arm hurting, Lauren buzzing on MSN, Mum reading Dad something philosophical in (speculating here) the hope he'll show some calibre. Something idiotic on television. Arm really hurting.  Lauren says I'm a blog whore, and I'm sad to say it's true.  Impending events: -Monday's meet and greet with the Japanese people, in which I might just have to drown Cassie in Carney's soup; -Tomorrow's most probably harrowing search for a present for Wendy's sixteenth. She's sixteen- oishimoi; -A weekend of homework and long hours pondering my subject selection sheet, wondering if my future really does lie in nuclear physics.  Stay Tuned, knuckleheads, I would.

       Nhi.    I might keep this. My track record, in case you haven't heard, is terrible when it comes to these things.    I'll try.
