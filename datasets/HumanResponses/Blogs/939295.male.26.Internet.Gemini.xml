        Returning from work yesterday I was perturbed to see the exit to Brixton tube station all clogged up with people sheltering under the leaking roof from the most torrential downpour I have ever witnessed. I got about 10 metres before I was soaked through, pausing to shelter under the bridge. Then some hail kicked off - there were ice balls the size of hazelnuts and bigger! And me with no umbrella. I called Rachael to find she was waiting in the station; she ran out to meet me and we decided to take shelter in Sainsbury's. 15 minutes of procrastination later it was STILL hammering away. Then I remembered that my flat is prone to a leaking roof under these circumstances, so we set off into the flood with a sense of urgency derived from my desire NOT to return to a drenched, short-circuited collection of electronic instruments and applicances. We made it across Atlantic road to the next bridge, sodden once more, heavy traffic pushing vast tides of water in our direction every few seconds, my concerns transferring to the welfare of my phone and PDA. Bag turned over, phone placed in back pocket we made another few feet to the entrance of the Beehive and sheltered with a cursing man who was desperate to find a taxi. He bravely ventured out (to a good old soaking) and we helped a middle aged lady to open her umbrella (she was having trouble with the clasp). "You want to hold on to THAT", I telled her, implying that umbrella-theft was currently the number-one most likely opportunistic criminal annoyance. She didn't hear me, but we sent her out with umbrella open. Don't know how far she made it. To be honest, my glasses were so covered in water, no dry clothing left to wipe them, the world had become a noisy blur.  We made another run for it, splashing through puddles two inches deep, to find that some helpful soul had put up some signs to indicate that the pedestrian crossing was "out of service". Well, yeah - the water was nearly a foot deep - boats and swimmers only! We walked along Brixton road, hoping to find a place where the water was a bit shallower, but four minutes later it became apparent that the whole of Brixton Road had been transmogrified into a river, and not having gleaned any bridge-building skills from the tv-survival shows of Ray Mears and the likes, it became apparent that the only way we were gonna get home was by wading. The downpour had slowed down a bit by then at least. We went back to the first crossing and made a break for it. I had considered removing my shoes, but the prospect of all that sewage, chicken bones and used syringes against my feet was not entirely appealing. One brave fellow hopped across, feet darting in and out of the water, and we soon followed his example. It wasn't as bad as I'd expected - our trousers and shoes got soaked through, but the socks took most of the wetness and we were through the door and pulling them off before our feet got too saturated.  Thankfully, the ceiling drippage was minimal. A builder had been around earlier in the day in response (at last) to our complaints a couple of weeks ago that my housemate's possessions had all been soaked from the last downpour by water dripping through the light fittings. Not much consolation to Jon, who had already been screwed by the rain, but thankfully there were no electrical casualties.  The landlord came round and breathed a sigh of relief that his property was okay, "In the fourty years I've lived in this country I've never seen anything like this!". Apparently, during that storm in the 80's our ceiling and the ceiling below had both come down...  Unfortunately, the evil-church's glass roof was spared. Dammit.

      Hope you're enjoying the new title banner. I certainly am!  Newsness-    The Decepticons   are regrouping once again for another comeback gig at the Trent Hotel in Radcliffe on the 17th of July. That's a week on Saturday. We haven't practiced for a year and we've only got time for a couple more before the gig, but hopefully we'll cram in all the goodness we can. If not we will no doubt resort to novelty, which has never let us down in the past. Get in. Also Ben has kindly lent us his Drum Machine, so who knows what electronical shenannigans night ocuur?   Poster will be online shortly.

      'Sup? Just got back from the Big Chill Festival in Hereford, and it was pretty bomb-like. Highlights were John Peel, (With his signature drastic changes of musical styles - 70's Funk to Hardcore Gabber to German Folk. Sweet.) Chas & Dave (Niceness), Lederhosen Lucil, (believe me, if you saw her live you would fall in love with her.) MC Pitman, (Twat hater. And how!). Yoda did a live turntable score to "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", which was interesting. Senior Coconut had the crowd a-jiving with their Latin covers of Kraftwerk classiques, and Mr Scruff's afternoon Tea Sessions were lovely (He sure is a winner; Plays whenever he can, wherever. Had his own Tea Shoppe, which served tea and all that wikid tea/pie-related merchandise). Also new People I never heard of - Orijahnal Outernational(roots live reggae), and New Sector Movement were Funkahectic. Ritchy Pitch did a good set but there weren't many folk in his tent at the time. All in all a special-nice weekend.
