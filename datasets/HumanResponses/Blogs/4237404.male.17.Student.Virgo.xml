      YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!  it just popped out of my thoughts because i remembered what my filipino friend staying in canada told me. She was asked by her fooriegn classmate there if how long she has stayed in canada.My riend answered "a month or so," the guy replied," i thought you have stayed here longer cause you speak english well because i thought that schools in the Philippines are just huts."......that guy's a loser!  did you guys know that some universities in the philippines are among the best in the world......some of which were one of the first schools to have a state-of-the art web sites in the world.......  Filipinos are one of the best english speakers.......We know proper english not just american street slangs.......heck, were even better at proper english than some americans........just stating my thoughts..............;p  that's all for now
