      I'm finally done with those damn weeds.&nbsp; Okay, I had to do 1/3 of an acre, solid weeds, for our garden. You don't realize how hellish that can be.&nbsp; My legs ached like hell, so occasionally I would sit down to do them.&nbsp; I have ant bites EVERYWHERE!&nbsp; I thought I had it pretty bad.&nbsp; I went psycho because the ants were biting me, and I had one on the inside of my thigh, kinda high up there (not really high, just pretty).&nbsp; Well, one, I thought?&nbsp; Try SIX!&nbsp; There are six bites, and they are huge, pink bumps and they itch and sting.&nbsp; I HATE ANTS!&nbsp; People act like they are so great because they work together and act like the community everyone wishes we were.&nbsp; Screw that!&nbsp; The bastards bite and they have no mind of their own!&nbsp; So what if they can tunnel and lift like 6 times their own weight?&nbsp; I'll admit it, I can't do that.&nbsp; I CAN step on them though.&nbsp; Show me an ant that can do THAT!&nbsp; I'm better than them.&nbsp; I hate ants.

      Well, my concert was GREAT!  It was a little hard getting to the ampitheatre, but it was worth it. Red rocks is amazing!  We had a really tough time finding a good spot.  Fianlly though, we found a place in the 6th row from the stage.  We could actually see the features on their faces!  It was truly great.  Almost everyone there was really preppy, the sort who obviously has a lot of money.  Hell, with a lot of those people, their parents probably paid for it.  I'm completely in debt to my parents.  I'll be doing a lot of babysitting and ironing for this concert.  But man, ws it worth it.  Adam Levine is sooooooooo hot, and Maroon 5 KICKED ASS.  Of course, I knew all the words to all the songs.  My god, I listen to that cd enough.  at least once a day... since june 1st... 2003.  I'm obsessed... so?  john mayer was really sexy too, but he tried eating the microphone.  I love the man to death, but he's so weird when he sings, and has no rhythm.  People seemed to like our saying.  while everyone else shouted "you're hot" or "marry me" or "john mayer rules", we were yelling "john mayer, be my squeegee bitch!".  We saw this article where he was talking about his first job, and he talked about how he was the best squeegee in the land, and how he could make the gas pump stop at exactly $15.  So, we made a poster that said "John mayer- the best squeegee in the land".  They wouldn't let us take it in, but they let someone else take their poster.  =(.  But everyone loved us for having an original saying.  It was a great concert, overall.

      well, had my first day of driving today.  It was kinda scary.  Man, it's weird to have somene else playing with the brakes.  The handling and brakes were different from my car, so I had a little dificulty at first.  After the first turn i eas okay though.  I-25 was a little scary.  We lived.

      Hey, just made this TODAY!!  .... ummmmm... okay, today is the 4th of July, and I am bored.  I was planning to go to some weird celebration at the museum, but you know how it is without transportation.  Can't wait til' I get a driver's license.  I went to a party yesterday with Kallie.  That was fun.  We rode ATVs.  It was the first time I ever did that.
