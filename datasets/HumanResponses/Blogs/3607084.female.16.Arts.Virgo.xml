      I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do

      Notice me, take my hand Why are we strangers when Our love is strong? Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, Baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you, Baby  I make believe that you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done? You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, Baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you’re haunting me I guess I need you, Baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song's my sorry  At night I pray That soon your face will fade away  And everytime I try to fly, I fall Without my wings, I feel so small I guess I need you, Baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you’re haunting me I guess I need you, Baby

      Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing, And your voice caught within your chest? It isn't Love, it's  Like . You can't keep your eyes or hands off of them, am I right? It isn't Love, it's  Lust . Are you proud, and eager to show them off? It isn't Love, it's  Luck . Do you want them because you know they're always there? It isn't Love, it's  Loneliness . Are you there because it's what everyone wants? It isn't Love, it's  Loyalty . Do you stay for their confessions of Love, because you don't want to hurt them? It isn't Love, it's  Pity . Are you there because they kissed you, or held your hand? It isn't Love, it's being  Unconfident . Do you belong to them because their sight makes your heart skip a beat? It isn't Love, it's  Infatuation . Do you pardon their faults because you care about them? It isn't Love, it's  Friendship . Do you tell them every day they are the only one you think of? It isn't Love, it's a  Lie . Are you willing to give all of your favorite things for their sake? It isn't Love, it's  Charity .   Does your heart ache and break when they're sad? Then it's Love. Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret? Then it's Love. Do you accept their faults because it's part of who they are? Then it's Love. Do you cry for their pain, even when they're strong? Then it's Love. Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's Love. But do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and elation pulls you close and holds you? Then it's Love. Would you give them your heart, your life, to the point of death? Then it's Love.    Now, if Love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we Love? Why is it all we search for in life? This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for? This torture, this powerful death of self? Why? Because it's... Love

      [Intro] I don't understand why See it's burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that don't mean I want to What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just I feel like this is coming to an end And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  [Verse 1] It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think you're gonna change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby I ain't happy baby Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you do Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Verse 2] Sendin' pictures I ain't supposed to Got somebody here but I want you Cause the feelin ain't the same  find myself Callin' her your name Ladies tell me do you understand? Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? It's the way I feel I know I made a mistake Now it's too late I know she ain't comin back What I gotta do now To get my shorty back Ooo ooo oooh Man I don't know what I'm gonna do Without my booo You've been gone for too long It's been e-leven days, ump-teen hours Im'ma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  [Bridge] I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  [Breakdown] Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh Ooh ooh oooh (do ya feel me burnin'?) Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh  So many days, so many hours I'm still burnin' till you return  [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you do Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over You know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn
