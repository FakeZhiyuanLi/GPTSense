      Okay, okay...I couldn't take it anymore. I needed a place to say a few things. Perhaps it will make some sense once I get warmed up to this?  What happened last night during Kerry's speech? I noticed him saying a few things that didn't make any sense. It reminded me of how my mother spoke after she had a STROKE. What is a menator? I swear I heard him say; "Senators and Menators"...I think he was going to say; "Members of Congress?" I see that others caught that "hair pollution comment, too. I thought I was going to fall over when I heard that one.   Yeah, I mean, I can understand the pressure of this "most important speech of Kerry's political career," but...maybe intead of spending 30 minutes a day writing it, it should have spent 30 extra minutes a day reading it aloud to an audience. Maybe that hamster, Licorice is still alive? He could, at least, have read to him/her?  What is going on with this...missing out on mentioning Kerry's ex-wife and how he ANNULED that marriage?! I don't even consider myself more than a moderate sort of person and this even perplexed (okay, pissed me off) me! Did you see that movie? It says how he was a newlywed in Congress...then all of a sudden...he's married again. Oops. Forgot to mention what happened? I think not.  Stay tuned...

      Yeah, someone has to write about this, don't they? It might as well be yours truly.  The cat population in my home changes all the time. I used to be of the mind that 2 cats were all anyone ever needed (one for each hand to pet) until I started doing animal rescue a few years ago. I promised myself and everyone who knows me that I would NEVER let it get out of control and certainly NEVER become a "cat lady." You know the type I'm talking about.  The most cats I've had here is 9. Currently, I have 5 cats and 3 "foster" cats. My house is large enough so everyone has a place they can call their own. Of course, having so many cats does have it's share of problems. It's time consuming to feed and clean litter pans. I have to vacuum all the time! Sharing a Queen-sized bed with my boyfriend gets difficult when 4 or more of the cats want to sleep with us. I can't count the backaches I've gotten from sleeping in weird positions so as to not roll over onto them. But..it is nice to wake up and see them all knocked out and happy, some even laying on their back with their paws up in the air.   Fortunately, I work from home so that gives me time to play with them and groom them daily. That said, just how much time can one devote to a cat when there IS work to be done? What happens if one of them doesn't get enough attention or one of them doesn't LIKE the other?  Fighting! Screaming! Breaking stuff...PEEING!!!!  There are times when I feel like I have a house full of 2-year olds who refuse to get along or behave for even a short period of time. I do my best not to play favorites, but my patience is challenged when it always seems to be the same few cats misbehaving.  Things have been relatively fine here until about a month ago when I started to discover cat piss in a few areas around the house. Bad sign. Once it starts it's tough to get it to stop. I know this since it happened a few years ago and it was a nightmare. This is even worse..now I have no sure idea as to who it is or if it is more than one of the cats.   Some fun places I've discovered the pee: • In the soil of some of my houseplants • On a SURGE protector for my stereo!!! • On two shirts that fell onto the floor (somehow!) • On my cute stuffed Chococat toy • On a folder full of my tax receipts from 2003! • Against my 1940's floorstanding radio ...and the winner... • on the edge of a guitar case...the pee travelled INTO the case and ONTO a 10-string guitar!!!!  Yes, I do know that peeing/spraying can be a sign of illness and one of the cats WAS sick. He was treated and is doing fine now. This just can't be a sick kitty since none of them are crying or showing other symptoms of illness. This is a, literally, PISSED OFF cat.  Honestly, I thought I had a BRAIN TUMOR for awhile. I had "this smell" stuck in my nose everywhere I went. My boyfriend has bad allergies so he can't smell anything. Whatever I did, I kept noticing this odor. It was driving me crazy!!!! I didn't think it was cat pee because I thought I had found all of it! I even bought a black light so I could locate the pee more easily. Did you know black light makes the pee luminess?  I got really awesome enzyme neutralizer for the piss...that seems to help..but the cats are not going to stop. Every day something else gets ruined. So today I spent a huge amount of cash on an order of  urlLink The Comfort Zone Plug-In for Cats  and I'm starting to give the cats  urlLink Rescue Remedy .   If I was really smart, I would also get my butt on the cushion and do some  urlLink Shamata Meditation . Yes, I'm a Buddhist, too and this irritation is supposed to be joyful as this situation reminds me I'm on a path here and nothing is perfect nor will it last (ahh..impermanance again) forever.  Yeah, right.  Wish me luck.   Back to piss patrol.  Over and out.

      Go, go, go! Get it done NOW Faster! Cheaper! You are a loser if you don't get out of bed and RUSH to work and do a great, devoted job for 8.0 hours and you don't go right back home and WORK on things at home! Do NOT sit DOWN. Do NOT relax! Never be idle! Idle hands...   urlLink The Virtue of Idleness

      File under: Too Weird to be True.  I dated a guy a few years ago. We were friends before and after we hooked up/broke up. This, in itself, is a miracle since, as most of us have discovered, break-ups mean never having to say ANYTHING ever again, let alone, "Sorry." The fact that we did remain good friends was very cool. We both dated other people and for awhile everything was fine. I was even helpful when his relationship came to a sad close. I was his ear, his confident, his buddy. I made up cool images for him to use on his new personal ad (when he was ready to start looking again). I even consulted with him on who might be a good choice to persue.  Then, "she" came along. She found him. Not only did she find him, even though she didn't "fit" his request of what he was looking for, he fell for her big-time. She is smart, funny, independent, a good mom. He said "no one more than a few miles away from where I live." She lives 65 miles away. "No one with kids." Oops...she has one. Doesn't matter. He's hooked. I expect wedding bells already and it's only been 3 months. He pretty much stopped talking to me about personal things. Yeah, he was busy with work ,but I was there for the bad times and now...well I just started to feel poverty stricken and lonely. Where was my buddy? He seemed to be gone.  I became obsessed with reading their blogs. I checked them almost every day. Each time I searched for clues. Did he love her more than me? Was she better than me? Were they having more fun than when we dated? I got to see pictures of them-a small peek through the door of their life together. I would see comments about cool furniture that my ex had in his apt...but did he ever tell anyone I picked it all out? She should probably love me just as much as him, since I had helped, behind the scenes, get him to do nice things for her (in the beginning before he closed off to me).  Then I went away on a Buddhist retreat for two weeks.  Part of what I learned while away was to focus on "being" with irritation and be willing to just feel uncomfortable. The other part was to work on being open, instead of closed-off, closed-minded. I realized that the loss I felt was certainly natural since all things are in a constant state of change and change can feel painful. I also realized that instead of focusing on what I no longer had, I should take a better look around at my own life. I saw my relationship with a great man, who I have become tremendously intimate with. I finally feel comfortable around someone else. We have a radiance together. The problem was simply just learning to accept change, be open to what comes of it and stop being afraid...  ...and there she is. I am online. I am talking to my ex. He says; "Would you like to meet K.?" Before I can answer...there we are, chatting away. I just went with it and I found things that really should not have surprised me. I think it was relief, actually. It was freedom. Whatever I was worried about fell away.   She is just as smart and capable and funny as I had guessed. I like her a lot. I think we will become great friends. I feel that already. I could have shut down and pushed this entire situation away. Instead, I not only get to maintain a very long friendship with my ex, but I get to be a small part of his life with K.   I sincerely feel a sense of amazement about this...and the extra shocker is she just offered up a project for me to work on. No, don't think she's being catty. Not. See, that's what comes of not clinging to the outcome, not being afraid. Once you let go of all that neurotic shit there's freedom.  [By the way, I do have to mention that K. also has extremely huge "nuts" for being willing to chat with me, too. Yet another reason to be impressed with her. She is definitely a cool chick.]
