      hey, im bored. i just woke up a while ago and theres absolutely nothing to do today. i got nothing to say really... ooo wait, i do... next week im gonna b like living at marquette school center. i go there at 12:45 and leave at 7! we got r conditioning from 1-3, and afterwards we have to run the camps for little kids. the first one is 3-5, and the second is 5-7. i hope troy lets ppl go get us food, cuz damn by the end of the day we will b fucking starving. im so not looking forward to more jump training or weights. my&nbsp;thighs r so sore. those lunges really get to u after being completely dormant in that region for a little more than a month. i never realized how much muscle u can lose from one stupid injury that keeps u from working out, let alone playing vball. o well, just gotta keep workin. well, yaaa...

      today i had that beach party with my vball team. it was pretty fun. i got burnt on my back tho, it hurts really bad... and yet i didnt get ne sun on my stomach at all. im seriously wondering how that happened, and its making me fuckin mad. but we ate, swam, and played a game of beach vball (ofcourse). i got home around 5 and talked to some ppl on msn msgr, and then brian got all bitchy and started pissing me off just cuz adam got on my addy and started fighting with him. id say they both needa just cool it. who the fuck cares? they needa drop that shit and just move on. good Lord! o, and omg, i have to fuckin babysit tomorrow from 6:30am-4:30pm!!! its gonna b hell! um... im really bored right now; watching some gay-ass tv show that ive never seen b4. it kinda sucks. mmm... i should go running or work out or something. meh... i prolly wont.

      well, i had a boring day today... nothing really to talk about. woke up at 12:30, ate, got on msn msgr for a while, watched tv, listened to music, talked to brian on the phone, ate some more, got on msn msgr again, and now im typing this. really dull if u ask me. but tomorrow my marquette vball team is having a beach party from 12-4, so im excited about that... i guess, except for the fact that i gotta get up at like 11. damn, thats to early. this is summer! they cant expect us to get up ne earlier than 1 if u ask me. but i guess theres nothing i can do. ok, well i got nothing more to say now...
