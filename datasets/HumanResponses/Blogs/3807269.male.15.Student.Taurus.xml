At this site we talk about the latest hockey happening but especially the newest hockey equipment. There used to be a website  urlLink Corebeam.net  but that shut down because of some issues over a contest.    urlLink Chalktv.com  - The Dave Chalk Connected show is one of the shows that I watch every episode of. Although the show is not very informative It still tells me what is new on the marketplace.    urlLink Scottishot.com     urlLink Walmartphotocentre.ca     urlLink NHL.com     urlLink Google.ca     urlLink Gmail.com     urlLink Bauer.com     urlLink Eastonhockey.com     urlLink CCMSports.com     urlLink GrafCanada.com     urlLink Sportsline.com     urlLink TSN.ca

      If found this very interesting and thought that I should share it. It was found at  urlLink Scottishot.com    My thoughts on Windows     Microsoft Windows XP - the latest and greatest?    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I run Windows XP on a secondary partition on my laptop. I use it at work, and get just enough time in it to realize how stupid it is! Seriously! I'm not even talking about the coding aspects of the operating system. I'm talking about the totally rediculous everyday stupidities in this program we all use at one point or another.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows XP, the windows "XP-erience". Come with me and I'll show you memories from my Windows experiences.                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's jump right in, shall we? We begin our Microsoft Windows XP-erience by logging on and getting to the desktop. Wow, what a beautiful background Micrososft gave us! My mouth dropps open as I gasp at it's beauty! I haven't seen a hill like this since Teletubbies! This looks like the kind of wallpaper *I* want to use. I'm really glad Microsoft chose such a professional looking default wallpaper for their newest operating system.                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can resist those incredible color schemes! Blue, white, red, and green - colors this vivid are rarely seen outside of Toys'R'Us! Leave it to Microsoft to create a professional looking (but somehow 'fitting') color scheme for their wonderful new lines of operating systems. Uhoh, take a look at the height of the default window decorations. I want to find the complete moron who thought up THAT idea. "Maybe if we make the title bar 25px high, it'll be a completely usesless waste of space and make our OS look a lot more childlike".                              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, the default windows background sucks BIG TIME. Let's take a look at out alternatives! Upon a quick inspection, you'll find a plethora of ghastly wallpapers that you can use for your system! They're 100% free too! Now you can pick between bubbles, bricks, pink swirles, or greyish brown chinese fans! (pictured here)                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Open up any folder or drive in the windows explorer window and selec help. One of the options you'll see is "Is this copy of Windows legal?". You can follow the steps to see if your version of Windows is legitimate. If it is, you're a retard.                              I don't know about you, but I feel the windows XP icon sets are an insult ot my intelligence. However, let's take a closer look:         topleft - (display settings) what's with the paint?         topright - (hardware) who the heck has a combo. printer/mouse?         midleft - (sound) a golfclub a suction cup. big deal         midright - (users) oh yeah, that looks mature.         botleft - (space) wow, that looks like my 2nd grade math book         botright - (date) who has a callendar with 14 days on it?                              In the find dialogues, you always get incredibly helpful little assistants that watch you while you search. No one really knows what they do. But becide taking up cpu you could be using to quicken your search, that processing power is put into animating these incredibly professional looking 3d assistants.                               Let's say I want to switch users. Cool.            Q: How do I switch users without logging off?            A: Click LogOff , then "Switch User"                               we're back to wallpapers! My my, look at these beauties that Microsoft hid from the world by stashing it in the "my pictures" folder. Who the heck uses the "my pictures" folder anyway? I want to see the person who got these pictures. They're too high contrast to use as wallpapers! crazyness!                              Ok, I know you've all XP-erienced it. You go to copy a file, it gets tou bout 99% complete then it says you have a GAZILLION minutes remaining in your file transfer. Anyone know what causes this? It's been happening since windows 95. And *no* one seems to be able to fix it.                               Let's take a quick look at the new screensavers that windows xp provides us after it's 200$ pricetag!            wha... what? Only one new screen saver? oh man, it must be SWEET!            ::blink:: That's the screensaver? Wow, imagine the coding behind that one.                               Windows XP supports the NTFS filesystem. I personally have lost about 6 gigs of data (Japanese Mp3s) using NTFS when the power went out. Apparently, NTFS has a "slight drawback" in the sense that if power to the hard drive is cut while it's writing to the disk, data loss occurrs. It can sometimes fix it at boot, but sometimes fails or just doesn't see the problem at all. For XP, I use the FAT filesystem. However I think it's funny. This bloated filesystem that's so big and clunky is named FAT!                               I could write an entire page about the stupidities of internet Explorer.            So you load a wallpaper or big image and - oops! it's stretched so it doesn't run off the page. It's not anti aliased and it looks horrible            you can fix the image by hoving off the image, hovering back on, waiting 4 seconds, and clicking the bottom right of the image. What a stupid thing to do! If you're going to include image resizing, make it anti alised, and make it so clicking the image will size it back to purportion. Mozilla's Firebird browser has this feature just right.                                So you want to shut down your computer.            Great.            Just wait 10 or 15 seconds for your processor to crank out 20 fullscreen bitmaps slowly fading your current desktop to black and white. Why do you want the fade? no clue. Why do we want black and white in the first place?!                                You should be a good person and update Windows regularly.            Why?            BECAUSE WINDOWS SUCKS.            Read the updates (for once). It's discusting how bad these 'mild problems' are that Windows Update fixes really are.                               Windows XP supports Windows Media Player 9! WOW! I'll bet Windows Media Player 9 is packed with TONS of really cool features! Just take a look at the Media guide! Well, you don't have a choice. It loads automatically every time you load the player. It takes 10-15 seconds to load because of it too. But something that takes that long to load must be a killer media guide! Just look how informative the text is! And observe how beautifully it fits inside the player with minimal scrolling.                                 We all know how to get to Windows Update - but what the heck is the "windows catalog" and who has ever clicked that icon? Anyone?                              A microsoft employee must have been pretty gosh darn bored out of his mind to put Volume Control under the Entertainment section.

       I was sitting at my computer and watching TV  and thought that I might as well blog. I thought that maybe I could try something new tonight and blog freestyle, yes freestyle blogging!   Yesterday my mom and I were trying to go somewhere  but when we tried to start our car it wouldn't start. After calling some places my mom discovered that the battery was 'drained' and needed to be replenished by driving for about one hour on the highway. We drove around for a while on the highway then came home. Today we started the car without trouble but my mom insisted to buy a new battery. Why does this story have any value to anybody? Well is doesn't but I still like to tell usless stories.   I still have 62 days left of summer holidays!  I have so far had 5 days of summer vacation and not done one single thing. My proudest summer moment to far is getting my Gmail account, which is pretty sad. As for what I am going to do this summer, I plan to help out at our store, play in the Alberta Summer Games, and blow something up. My friends dad works in the United States and always brings back firecrackers. Although firecrackers ar ilegal in Canada, I still enjoy using them. These aren't your regular firecrackers these ones are waterproof and just about as loud as a .22 rifle. As for the Summer Games, it will take up two weekends and hopfully be very fun. An extremely bad thing about the Summer Games is that you have to sleep in school floors on mats. I have never slept on a school floor but can make a fair judgment that it will not be very pleasant. From time to time I sleep on my own floor but that is alot different. As for helping out at our store it pretty hard work because we I would have to do the cash register, ice creme, stocking, and firewood. I officially hate firewood! We sell about an average of 250 bags of firewood per day and have to carry each one across the parking lot. After a while the weight of the bags doesn't bother me it is the rude customers. All the customers think that there getting ripped off and think that we must carry all of them and load them into thier car. One example is when a very strong man made one of the female workers, with a borken wrist, carry a bag of firewood to his car. What a dick eh!  I am pretty tired and waiting for  The Simple Life 2: Road Trip  to start.

       This is my remote blogging site.  I still have my old site. http://sean.digital-chost.net but I am going to use this blogging site to write long blogs about 3 to 4 times a week. By doing this i hope I can make my grammer better.   I thought that maybe I could start off my introducing myself.  I have prepared some questions to ask myself.   What is your Name?  Sean  How old are you?  15  Where and when were you born?  Toronto, Ontario, Canada on April 22, 1989  Where do you currently live?  Camrose, Alberta, Canada   Here are some usersubmitted questions.   Why do you waste your time blogging?  To me blogging is not a waste of time but it does take up alot of your time. I main reason I blog is because I know alot of people are like me and maybe they can find some small interest in reading my blog each day. I second reason I do it is so that I can maybe get better grammer. I have always wanted to be able to be a great writer.   What do you do in the summer time?  Our family owns a store at a Provinal Park. I usually work out there for the entire summer. We have owned it for the past 12 years.   What is your favorite sport?  I favorite sport is hockey. I love to play and watch hockey. The reason I like hockey so much is because it is so fast paced and the intensity is unbeatable. Last ice hockey season I was the captain and leading scorer of my hockey team. About 10 days ago I ended my inline hockey season. Our team was not that good but I still scored many goals! Two weeks ago I tried out for the 2004 Alberta Summer Games zone 4 inline hockey team and made it! I have training camp in two weeks and the acual tournamnet in in about one month.  If you are wondering something please feel free to email questions to my email adderes. seanmccann@beer.com

       Last Weekend I was in Red Deer for a team building training weekend.  For the most part the weekend was amazing. I'll get into some detail as we go on with the blog.   I weekend started off on Saturday morning.  I had to get up at 7:00 AM and leave at 8:00 AM for Red Deer. We arrived in Red Deer around 9:20 but check-in was at 10:00 so we drove around and came back at 10. My McDonalds breakfast was not sitting to well so I was glad to hear the we didn't go onto the surface until 1:00 PM.   As soon as all the players were checked-in , we all went into the commons area and did some team building things. First we had to say our full names with our middle names and so did everyone else. It was easy for the Red Deer players but for us guys from Camrose it was tough because we didn't know everyone's last name.    We all got dressed and went on the surface.  I will have to say that that was the hardest practice that I was ever apart of. It was tough in every way. The heat didn't make it any better either. I was dead and could bearly stand up after that. I will leave that practice at that.   After eating subs we got split into groups and choice a hockey player.  The other groups had to guess our player by asking us questions. Right after a few questions I knew who one of the groups player was but got the ending of the name wrong. Nobody guessed ours but we guessed one groups'.   The next thing that we did was go to the circuit training gym.  I would have tried harder but I thought that the second practice was going to be just as hard as the first so I went light. I really wish they had a gym like that in Camrose.   After some practice we went to Gullivers.  We got the WHL meal which included all you can get bread and salad and a chicken alfrado pasta. It was a really great meal but we never really got alot of bread.   Next we went to the motel.  I won't name the motel but it was supposed to be a resort mtel but in my opinion was pretty bad compared to most of our hockey hotels that we stay in. It had a really nice view to the lake. We had a really good time that night.   On Sunday we had a 20 minute walk followed by the best breakfast i've had for a while.  Itwas a buffet style.  We had some more team building and had an easy practice then went home. It was very fun.  Aside from hockey I plan on blogging more and blogging from que cards so that I know what to blog about.

      Hey dedicated readers of my blog! I have never been so lazy in my life. These first days of summer have been not very fun filled. This is my day:  Wake up Shower Eat Watch Saved By the Bell Go onto computer Watch court shows on TV Go back onto computer watch more TV go to sleep  Of course that is not exactly what I do but still you can tell how bored I am!   I got my friend a Gmail account today.  I really had to talk him into it but I got him one from eBay. It was very cheap but when the auction was done he gave me the money via Paypal and I paid the seller. A few minutes later I logged into my Paypal account only to find out that Paypal charged me $0.35 to get the money from my friend! You would think that they would charge you when you pay somebody but I guess not. It just came to me that I remember signing up for the premiere account that you had to pay fees for. I am a so dumb!   I have 2 feedback on my new eBay account!  After one year of eBaying on my sister's eBay account we only accumulated a 4 feedback. Yesterday I created a eBay account and bought two Gmail accounts and now have a 2 feedback within a couple of days. Of course anybody could do this but the two feedback only cost me $1.26 CDN plus those stupid Paypal fees which I talked about in the above paragraph.   My friend just got a old computer.  It is a P-3 which has a 8 giga-byte hard drive. We plan to turn it into a web, FTP, and mail server. I really want to try out Mandrake Linux 10.0 so I downloaded the three ISOs and burned them to CDs.  I got to go to my friends house now to install that stuff. Have a good one! -Sean
