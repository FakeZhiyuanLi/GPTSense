        IN HONOR OF  the fact that I've had about four diet cokes in the past two hours (working on my Old Testament Survey course for my minister's license -- what a BEAST of a class)... and because I needed a mental break, visit my friend  urlLink Strongbad  to learn about the effects of caffeine.  Also, for good measure, you should visit  urlLink Li'l Brudder  (I can make it on my own!).

        This is my little world... a lot cleaner than usual. Photo serves as proof that it was at one point actually fairly tidy... it won't stay this way for long! (Oh, and no one's allowed to see my walk-in closet...)  Carly & Amy, it's as if you've had the royal tour...

         It seems I have a new enemy.      Seeing as how I can't conceivably blame myself, I shall blame Ben &amp; Jerry's. How  do  they sleep at night?      Last night, I discovered "Brownie Batter Ice Cream." Absolute heaven, now available at your local Albertsons (on sale, in fact).       In fact, I discovered it all the way down to the bottom of it's cute pint-size tub. Seemed innocent enough, right? Just a cute little guy... Not a huge container like the regular ice cream. It's the size of a blizzard.       Turns out there's not too many things better in ice cream than brownie batter. You've got to try it - but beware the addiction. It's like the crack of ice cream.      Crack with (18 grams x 4 servings =) 72 grams of fat per carton. Atkins would turn over in his grave.       It's kind of pointless when you look at the label  after  you've partaken... I'd rather live in blissful fatty ignorance.    (72 grams ... Goodness. I'd have to run for a year to burn that off. So I'll probably just not run at all and call it good.)      Off to coffee with Abby... coffee with chocolate in it... sigh.

        ***DISCLAIMER*** I had a fairly rotten day and am attempting to make sense of it, so if you're looking for a laugh, try tomorrow's post. I should be fine by then.  :)      "Do you ever feel you've become the worst version of yourself?"  Quite the question, voiced by Tom Hanks in  You've Got Mail ... one of my favorite movies.      I feel that way pretty rarely, but there are certainly times where I look at the current version of myself and think, " That's the best we can do? " I get frustrated, but find it hard to change, at least for any consistent length of time. Mediocrity, it seems, is a specialty of mine.       My day began with waking up in a panic at 8.45 a.m., when work started at nine. Let's just say it all went downhill from there (and my schedule went increasingly haywire from there). I haven't cried much recently, but I cried four times today. Lack of sleep=emotional mess. Lack of preparation=literal mess. It was a rough day, the hardest part about it being that it was a rough day completely of my own making. If I would just get organized... plan a bit better... build some healthy habits... I'd save a lot of energy that's spent running around (wait for it...) like a chicken with its head cut off. More effort on the front end = less wasted time and less work needed on the tail end. It looks lovely on paper, but the truth is, I haven't found a way to make it translate into every day life. And I stay the same, which is so frustrating.      Maybe the real question isn't "Do you ever feel you've become the worst version of yourself..." It's this question:  "Are you ever afraid that this is the best self you're ever going to be?"       I do what I don't want to do, but I don't do what I do want to do... Paul wrote this or something very like it... He understood. His "thorn in his flesh" drove him nuts, and he pleaded with God to remove it, but He didn't. Who knows what his thorn was? I have no idea, but evidently it bothered him quite a bit.       My thorns are: procrastination; lack of confidence; disorganized-ness; at times, settling for what-I-can-get-by-with rather than excellence ... and man, did I feel like they were on display in big huge bold red letters today. I was uncomfortable enough to actually want to change some things. I'm going to look at these in more detail in private (you don't want to read it, I don't want to type it, and besides, I'm working on brevity in my little posts), but one thing I will say that gives me a bit of peace...      God's not finished with me yet... this thing's a journey. And I haven't given up yet. Frustrated, yes. Disappointed with some of my dumber tendencies, yes. Resigned to my fate as a total flake? Not quite. (Plus, I'm still stubbornly convinced that God threw some good stuff in there too when he was adding ingredients, so it's not ALL uphill).      I've got to get some rest before I set myself up for Day From you-know-where, Part II, but I'll leave with this thought:      Thank God we're not what we used to be -    Thank God this ain't all we're ever gonna be.        For God is at work in you, giving you the desire to obey Him and the power to do what pleases Him.  Philippians something:or other.

           CURRENTLY PLAYING: The Postal Service (Death Cab's little side project)         So I've decided I'm ready to switch seasons.  Enough of this unholy heat.  This kid is happiest in 70 degree weather.  Perfection.  Remind me on my twelfth move not to pick a third story apartment.  Then again, this winter, my heat bill will be nada, because I'll steal heat from folks that live below.  Then we'll see who's clever Dan.  Evil laugh.                   NOW CURRENTLY PLAYING, 'CAUSE KEV STOLE MY CD: Coldplay - Rush of Blood to the Head          But seriously.  I'm ready to buy school supplies (there's a sick desire for eternal studenthood lodged in my little brain).  And sweaters.  Enough of this summer clothing... summer clothing is for  tan-stick-people , not  Irish   whities ... um, who are  not  stick people.               When I got back from Maui (proud of my summer glow), people said to me, "Stace, did you even go outside while you were there?" shocked at the fact I was, still, a whitie.  As if I'd trade in my  whitie DNA  for golden-tan DNA while on the Island (they hand GT-DNA out as you leave the plane, apparently).  The only thing on me that can tan is the top of my feet (and I'm quite proud of my flipflop tan).       I've tried, people!  The only thing this girl gets is more freckles.  And then more freckles.  I suppose if I tried hard enough, I could get all my freckles to connect, and then I'd be sort of a frightening orange-ish mess (and a skin-cancer patient), but that's the best I can do.          But yeah, I love fall.   Always feel like I'm starting something new in the fall, even when it's just really the same old thing.  And, sick person that I am, I like the cool overcast days and yes, even the rain.  (It would really be tough to live anywhere but here - I love Washington).       What's really happening is that I've done all the things I've looked forward to this summer, and am now just sort of bored.  Marking time until I have something to look forward to.  The only thing I've got coming up is a funeral... sigh.  They put Grandpa on morphine yesterday, and so it probably won't be long.  Modern medicine has its marvels, but sometimes it just keeps you alive long enough to wish you were dead long time ago.  (God, please PLEASE take me before 92... unless I'm for some reason, remarkably healthy, which is doubtful given my Wendy's addiction and distaste for running).         According to     urlLink  www.deathtimer.com     , I'll probably only live to be 81.   My Projected Date of Death:  June 14, 2061 .  (Morbid, huh?)  Some buddies and I checked it out on a computer in the church office, I dunno, several months ago.  We were laughing, having a good time.  Then one of our late-sixties pastors came and tried it.  (Then, suddenly, for some reason, it just wasn't a fun game anymore).       Then again, I guess, for all I know,  I could get hit by a bus tomorrow  and that would be the end of it.  (Or the beginning, depending on your perspective).  Or, another construction truck could cut me off on the freeway again & finish the job (I'm not bitter...  I'm not).  My point being, I'm not guaranteed anything.  My belief that  if I'm doing something for God, I'll stick around  was shattered three years ago when two guys -- awesome guys I knew from my year at a small Bible college -- died suddenly.  One, nearing graduation, died of appendicitis.  Another, a youth pastor, lost his life in a freak accident a month after he married his college sweetheart.        God doesn't owe me anything.  He certainly doesn't owe me more time.       What do I do with the moments  already  given me?  I spend them looking forward to something else, most of the time.  I find it hard to be present to the moment, especially when I'm at work, in my office-without-a-window.  (Out of random curiousity, I just figured out how much of my life I've spent so far at my desk in my office-without-a-window.   Two thousand sixteen hours .)  Most of those hours wishing I was someplace else.  That's a lot of time to lose.           Which is why, although I need to work at being more present & content at work, I'm not going to stay a lawyer's assistant forever.  I work hard to do my job well because I love my boss and because I care about the quality of what I do, but paper-shuffling really isn't that important to me.  In fact, to be truthful, it bores the crap out of me.  Doesn't tap into my creativity or my core competencies at all -- although I read a quote the other day that challenged me...        "Any activity becomes creative when the doer cares about doing it right or doing it better - John Updike."        You'll be surprised at the juicy little nuggets you get from that decod-a-quote puzzle in the paper (further proof of just how bored I get at work -- and of what a nerd I am.  Hey, I heard that developing other parts of your brain can help prevent Alzheimers, so sue me.  Plus, they decode stuff on Alias, and everything they do is cool).        I can't even count how many tangents that involved.  Paperpushing - creativity - deepquote - nerdy puzzle - defensiveness - Alzheimer's disease - Alias.  Whoa.       Anyway, I can't spend thousands of hours a year in a job that I'm not passionate about.  At least, not without going stark raving mad.  I need to be a good steward of the desires and talents that God has given me.  By not stepping out towards those things, I'm cheating God and cheating myself.  I realized that during my time up at Western WA University, when I was still trying to avoid pursuing ministry as a full-time occupation.  I knew my heart and my plans were headed in two opposite directions, but the desire to finish  something  kept me stubbornly moving in the same ill-fated direction. Then  a car accident stopped me in my tracks.  Well, actually, the first car accident didn't.  I kept trying, even if it meant attending class on percoset (not altogether a bad thing).  However, three months later, the  second  accident sent me home.  Another pursuit left unfinished.  Dang.  Waste of time and money.        God is so good at redemption , however, and -- despite the lack of faith that had me running scared -- He redeemed this chapter of my story.  Long story a tad shorter -- coming home put me in the path of Wes, my youth pastor since I was 17, who said, "Intern with me!"  Scared to death, but knowing it was the right move, I said yes to the three-year-internship, with the intent of becoming a worship pastor (love worship ministry, knew I was called to full-time ministry... made sense).         Began the internship in September, then, unexpectedly, January saw a goodbye to my old church as I moved with our new church plant, NewLife.    Change of plan  .  Then, in Maui, I realize, hey, I don't want to be a worship pastor.  Not my bag.  I'd rather be writing.  Bummer...wonder what on earth I'll do now?    Change of plan  .  I get back from my vacation and Wes says, "Hey, keep leading worship, but what we'll probably hire you to do is communication & writing."   Cool change of plan, with a dash of confirmation  .  And a dash of humor... communication is what I was studying in college.         So let me get this straight...  Unless the plan changes significantly, I'll be getting paid for something I went to school for and am naturally gifted in (comm/writing), for a church and pastor I love working for, while still pursuing my passion for music & worship (yet not risking killing the passion by having it be my paycheck)...    Only God.   Only God.        Only thing that's hard is that I have to wait.  It may be six months, it may be a year, before I turn that corner and I'm on staff, writing for my living.  Obviously, though, God has had it in His hands thus far, and as I seek His will, He will work it out for my good.  His timing is always best.  The only thing standing in between me and the         dreams I have is TIME.  So I'd better learn to be patient.         Then again,  that bus could be waiting for me out in the parking lot   of my apartment complex.  So I'd better make today count.  Which reminds me, I promised myself I'd take a walk outside tonight & catch the sunset.  Which is promising to be a doozie.  Peace.

        Humility sets us free to do what is really good, by showing us our  illusions  and withdrawing our will from what was only an  apparent  good. *    *    * Lord, you have taught us to love humility, but we have not learned.  We have learned to love the outward surface of it -- the humility that makes a person charming and attractive.  We sometimes pause to think about these qualities, and we often pretend that we possess them, and that we have gained them by "practicing humility."   If we were really humble, we would know to which extent we are liars!   Teach me to bear a humility which shows me, without ceasing, that I am a liar and a fraud and that, even though this is so, I have an obligation to strive after truth, to be as true as I can, even though I will inevitably find all my truth half poisoned with deceit.  This is the terrible thing about humility: that it is never fully successful.  If it were only possible to be completely humble on this earth.  But no, that is the trouble: You, Lord, were humble.  But our humility consists in being proud and knowing all about it, and being crushed by the unbearable weight of it, and to be able to do so little about it.   How stern You are in Your mercy, and yet You must be.  Your mercy has to be just because Your Truth has to be True.  How stern You are, nevertheless, in Your mercy: for the more we struggle to be true, the more we discover our falsity.  Is it merciful of Your light to bring us, inexorably, to despair?   No-- it is not to despair that You bring me but to humility.  For true humility is, in a way, a very real despair: despair of myself, in order that I may hope entirely in You.

       Reading ought to be an act of hommage to the God of all truth.&nbsp; We open our hearts to words that reflect the reality He has created or the greater Reality which He is.&nbsp; It is also an act of humility and reverence towards other men who are the instruments by which God communicated His truth to us.    &nbsp;  Christ, the Incarnate Word, is the Book of Life in Whom we read God.

         We had some good church tonight.&nbsp; As a friend of mine would say, "Man, that was some good chicken."&nbsp;     &nbsp;   We strive to be a church full of grace and truth, and though we're not perfect, I think we got a big taste of what that looks like tonight.&nbsp; Talked about temptation, and how none of us are exempt.&nbsp; None are perfect.&nbsp; None have reached a place where they've "arrived" and don't have struggles with their old mind and old habits anymore.&nbsp; So let's be real with each other and quit acting... quit pretending.&nbsp; Those things only keep us in bondage.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I was so proud of my pastor for his honesty and his vulnerability.&nbsp; It's not easy, and it's for sure not real common.&nbsp; Some ministers would prefer to keep up the guise of herculean invincibility...  I'm so super-spiritual... I can handle this all on my own... I never struggle, I never falter .&nbsp; That approach is by far probably more impressive from a distance, but it doesn't give much hope to those of us still living the lives of mere mortals.&nbsp; I don't know about everyone else in that room, but it helped me to know that someone who God uses phenomenally, still has bad days.&nbsp; Still has to keep himself in check and under accountability.&nbsp; If God uses him even through his humanity, then God can probably find a way to use me, too.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   There was a freedom tonight.&nbsp; People were honest about their hangups.&nbsp; Some even had the courage to stand, as if to say, hey, I've got some stuff I need God to deal with me on.&nbsp; And there were people there to stand with them.&nbsp; It was so the way church is supposed to be.&nbsp; No one elevated above another, just all of us there saying, hey, we all need God.&nbsp; We all need grace.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   My expectations of God have been far too low, I've realized.&nbsp; When God actually steps in and moves hearts and changes lives, I'm very nearly astonished.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; God's pretty big and pretty capable.&nbsp; Do I pray like I actually expect God to do something?&nbsp; Or do I just say meaningless words because that's what a good Christian does?&nbsp; Where is my heart?&nbsp; Do I pray like I expect God to do something  in me?      &nbsp;   There are just some moments where God's grace just seems so big.&nbsp; So tangible.&nbsp; So capable of covering it ALL.&nbsp; The reminder of how much I'm loved by God was so refreshing.&nbsp; It hit me hard.&nbsp; I didn't realize how much I needed it til it came, and the tears flowed a bit.&nbsp; It was just like God whispered to my heart -  Stace - I see you.&nbsp; My eyes are on you.&nbsp; And I love you.&nbsp; Quit trying so hard.&nbsp; Just know I already enjoy you.&nbsp; No need to try and impress Me.      &nbsp;   It's been a long week with many responsibilities.&nbsp; Adding to some of the heaviness I felt this week - my grandpa is most likely in the final days of his life as I write.&nbsp; I've known this is coming - he's 92 and has had about a million quad-bypasses - but it's bringing up emotions I didn't know I had, for a man who is pretty rough around the edges, always hard to please, and sometimes a bit hard to love.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've often joked that Grandpa is going to die of shock a second time when he gets to heaven and sees all the people&nbsp;God decided to let in.&nbsp; Family is family, though, even when they're stinkers sometimes, and I can't help but feel pain at the fact that he is in so much pain.&nbsp; Plus, it's&nbsp;really&nbsp;the pot calling the kettle black for me to pass judgement on someone else for their judgementalism.&nbsp; God's grace covers all...     &nbsp;   Please pray for my grandpa's peaceful passing (he's ready to go and has said so), for my Grandma (sweetest lady in the world) and for my family as we&nbsp;go through this time & figure out how to travel down to Stockton for services.     &nbsp;   I've learned that when a God moment happens in your heart, you just let it resound in there for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for letting me share it.&nbsp; May God's grace resound in your heart and life this week.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Blessings, S

         (This is an article I am currently working on for submission to RELEVANT, a magazine I love.&nbsp; We'll see what happens! &nbsp;Love to hear your thoughts...   urlLink  staceyrich1@hotmail.com   )       &nbsp;   Lying on a beach in Maui recently, enjoying the solitude and slow pace, I had some time to think. I’d looked forward for months to the chance to not have to think about my job, my bills, my to-do-list. So I didn’t. Instead I chose lighter fare – thinking about my purpose, my calling, my life’s direction. What a most likely dumb and most certainly dangerous thing to do. During my mental ramblings I experienced a rare moment of clarity. It brought about simultaneous eruptions of both fear and anger, as I heard the familiar message unmistakably:     you are moving (slightly) in the wrong direction. This is not what you were made to do.         Not again, God. I look like enough of a flake already. Not again.      My moment of clarity proved fleeting, as it touched off a plane ride and several days of confusion and, to tell the truth, just plain being ticked off.&nbsp; I’d sacrificed so much to follow a Voice I thought I heard so clearly... and now, all over again, it’s a mistake?      Have I ever heard Your voice at all, or do I just jump from whim to whim, playing this stepping-out-in-faith card whenever it’s convenient to hush those who would question my wisdom and/or sanity?        I know that this won’t necessarily win me any Faith-filled-Christian-of-the-Year award or anything, but writing is my form of confession, so I’ll say it here: God’s hand is hard for me to see sometimes. His purposes are beyond me. That’s not to say I don’t believe they’re good, I’m just saying this - Most of the time, I’m a bit confused. And in my own day-to-day craziness, there are times that it’s a gut-wrenching exercise of my faith to believe that, despite my circumstances, God is at work in me.       Every time I decide that I’ve got a clue as to what God is doing– or more specifically, why it is that He’s doing it – something happens to completely shake those assumptions up. Case in point: my college career. Perhaps "career" is too generous a term for it. I think "dabbling in college" might be a more accurate portrayal. I am one of those people who, when someone asks where I’ve got to school and what I studied, it takes a good ten to fifteen minutes to explain all the moves back and forth and the choice-of-major switches. &nbsp;Things seemed so solid seven years ago.&nbsp; What the heck happened?       I graduated high school so sure of myself. Unshakeable. I envy myself back then - the surety, the confidence I felt that I KNEW THE PLAN GOD HAD FOR ME, all five easy steps of it. The plan didn’t include three colleges, eleven moves, a&nbsp;serious car accident, and a still-elusive B.A., however.     The past seven years since graduation has been quite a journey, filled with more questions than answers. The main question has been this: How do I know I am in God’s will? When I step out in a certain direction, fairly sure of God’s hand in it, and then it fails, what do I do with that? Does God call me to certain paths only to lead me to another path? Or am I, as I’ve long feared, an incurable tumbleweed?      Has God called me to be a tumbleweed?      I think that might be part of my dilemma. When I think I’ve heard God’s voice, I tend to view it as a mandate for the rest of my life, when it’s more likely a path for a certain season. "Stacey, for the rest of your life, you’re going to be a ___________."      Oh, good. I finally know what I’m going to do when I grow up. Now the wondering can stop. The seeking You can end. My self reliance can begin. Phew. Glad that’s over.&nbsp; See you at the finish line, God.      I keep forgetting something about God. While He is infinitely more concerned with my well-being than I am, He’s considerably less worried about it. God is not worried about whether or not I reach my ultimate goals. My sights have been set for far too long on the end of that five step plan, whereas His have been on how close we’ll get during the ride. My seeking Him is way more important than my knowing exactly which path to take and when. Although there is not much that I can say for sure, I know this: the uncertain, tentative, yet reckless woman that I am now is a bit closer to God’s heart than she was at the age of seventeen, grabbing her diploma with self-confidence and clear visions of the path ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;     I think Thomas Merton had it right in his prayer in  Thoughts in Solitude: &nbsp; "Just because I  think  I am doing Your will does not mean that I am  actually  doing it.&nbsp; But I believe that the  desire  to please You does in fact please You, and so I&nbsp;will trust&nbsp;You always, even though I may seem&nbsp;to be&nbsp;lost&nbsp;and in the shadow of death.&nbsp; I will fear no evil, for You are ever with me, and You will never leave me to face my perils alone."      The more time goes on, the more I have a&nbsp;deeper awareness of my shakiness, my frailty.&nbsp; I used to crave the banishment of this constant reminder of my weakness, but more and more, I'm beginning to welcome it, even if the greeting is bittersweet.&nbsp; Facing my humanity&nbsp;squarely grants me the freedom&nbsp;to quit pretending I have it all together.&nbsp; I do not have to have the answers.&nbsp; I don't even have to have the right&nbsp;questions at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I do have to have is a closeness with One whose strength doesn't waver, whose sense of direction is never off, and whose grace is big enough to cover each and every fumbling step along the way.     &nbsp;   2 Corinthians 12:9&nbsp;"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Was reading this again... man, it's good stuff.&nbsp; Just passing it along...     &nbsp;   5.15    Afresh I seek thee.&nbsp; Lead me -- once more I pray --    Even should it be against my will, thy way.    Let me not feel thee foreign any hour,    Or shrink from thee as an estranged power.    Through doubt, through faith, through bliss, through    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stark dismay,    Through sunshine, wind, or snow, or fog, or shower,    Draw me to thee who art my only day.     &nbsp;   5.21    But he who would be born again indeed,    Must wake his soul unnumbered times a day.    And urge himself to life with holy greed;    Now ope his bosom to the wind's free play;    And now, with patience forceful, lie still,    Submiss and ready to the making will,    Athirst and empty, for God's breath to fill.     &nbsp;   GEORGE MacDONALD     &nbsp;

         Kevin  says that if I am going to make fun of him, I at least can get my facts straight.   He ran five miles.    Kev , you are a true inspiration.              I laugh, but the truth is, I CAN'T RUN THAT FAR.&nbsp; So the joke is on me and my lame, I  would  bleed from the ears if I ran that far, self.

       So here we go... my first posting.&nbsp; Thank you Josh Webb for the idea.&nbsp; Had some minor anxiety on what to name my little piece of web real estate, and then relaxed as I realized that I couldn't do much worse than "The Nerdery"... no offense Josh.&nbsp; Where's the picture of O'Rich?&nbsp;   Hmmm... so what is there to know about my small but significant life?&nbsp; Basic stats here... I turned 24 this year in May (How did that happen?&nbsp; It absolutely came  out of nowhere ).&nbsp; I share an apartment with my 21-year-old brother,&nbsp;furnished with the best furniture IKEA and Goodwill can provide.&nbsp; (By the way, you doubters... you can quit asking "How's  that  going?" while making that pity face.&nbsp; Living with my brother is muy excelente).&nbsp; I work as an assistant at a law office & for the first time ever have a great boss.&nbsp; I'm also interning with NewLife Church, working mostly in communication & writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm also&nbsp;leading worship there and working with my awesome pal Lili,&nbsp;growing&nbsp;our fledgling youth ministy.&nbsp;   When I'm not doing that, I'm (a) being a lazy bum laying out on my deck (which, by the way, recently was adorned by some lovely flower pots, thank you Mom), (b) playing my guitar, (c) at Tawny & Aaron's house, because, hey, it&nbsp;IS posssible for married folks to still hang out with their single friends, (d) reading a book from a recent Barnes & Noble binge that I'll probably get 2/3 of the way through before moving on to something more enlightening, or (e) attempting to watch an entire DVD season of Alias in one sitting.&nbsp; Oh, the sweet addiction...     Just got back&nbsp;4 a.m.&nbsp;Thursday morning from Outdoor Camp in Wenatchee... one deer, two cats, two power naps and four & 1/2 hours driving got me home.&nbsp; My buddy Kenn was absolutely NO HELP as he only added snoring to my trip home.&nbsp; It's ok White Rhino.&nbsp; No one's judging you.    More on camp later...

        IF a few of my posts look slightly different, it's because I was absolutely mortified at their length and took scissors to them. No comments? Probably cause people were so exhausted after reading that they were, in the words of my friend A. Powers, "spent." So, anyway, if you think I'm a total blabber mouth, 1) you're right, and 2) back off. I'm trying. And it's MY BLOG.  I AM OFF WORK THIS FRIDAY! And headed off Thursday night for a weekend camping trip with some of my dearest friends, Julie & Steph. Being away from work and meetings and - dare I say it? - intern responsibilities for four days in God's gorgeous creation will be absolutely heavenly. We are headed up to Lake Cushman in the Olympic National Forest, and will most likely hike some of the hikes at Staircase or Mt. Elinor while we're there.  It's so nice living in the Pac Northwest - whether you like hiking, skiing, the beach... it's all right here closeby.  And it's gorgeous...  Here's what it looks like at the Cush:

       I discovered that in addition to finding out what's truly important in life and running after it, there's another way to feel like a real and true grownup: I got a Costco card today. I can now buy in bulk what I never ever knew I needed. I shall never go hungry again.  This really all came about because Kevo and I decided to clean out our fridge. An ultimately good decision that began poorly as we figured out that 1) Tupperware + leftovers + back of fridge + three months = something very very bad, and 2) we have only condiments &amp; beverages, no food. We have three brands of BBQ sauce, every kind of salad dressing, ten gallons of ketchup, two varieties of salsa, and a few two-liters that went flat about a minute after our last party... no food. It is true that I only eat food to put sauce on it, but no food... doesn't really work.  So after our trip today, I don't think we'll need anything for a while. If a massive tragedy were to strike, I'd be ok for at least six months. Worst case scenario, I could live on the twenty-five pound bag of Super Lucky Elephant brand Jasmine Rice we lugged home. (There were two other kinds, but I opted for Super Lucky Elephant brand. The name is a brilliant piece of marketing. Super Lucky Elephant... or Regular Non-Lucky Kind? What do you  think  I'm going to pick???)  Happy Monday, folks. Remember, only five days til the weekend!

        Went with the folks to Claim Jumpers last night after shopping. Yum. Now, I don't know what it is, but shopping fully brings out the goofy in me and my mom. First off, me and this feisty redhead have the same obnoxious sense of humor. People, in general and sometimes specifically, are a neverending source of material. The world is just full of funny people. They don't know they're funny... they just are. The great thing is that we don't even have to point out to each other the reason for the laughter, thus risking hurting someone's feelings... one of us just catches the other's eye, and we're gone. My Dad just sorta sits back and watches... laughing at us as we're crying and dabbing our eyes with our napkins.  Tonight, however, we were our own source of laughter. This, in my family, is quite common. We tease each other a bit ruthlessly at times... the rule is, you stop if the person starts crying, other than that, they're fair game. Anyway, I can't fully describe to you what was so funny, it was probably more a product of exhaustion... but we laughed til we cried about four times during dinner. I love and treasure those moments... they're one of the best things about being in my family. I'm sure it's a you had to be there type thing, but to give you an idea of what dinner with the folks is sometimes like...  1. My dad, since I was little does the classic "What's that?" point-in-some-wierd-direction thing to distract me and steal some of my food. Tonight I didn't fall for it and told him to keep his grubby hands away from my plate. So then Mom goes and feels sorry for him and tosses our poor starving family member a piece of bread. I sat there for a second, debating, and then with an "OH, all right..." flung one teeny tiny french fry his way as if I was feeding the dog. 2. My mom ordered a bowl of soup that comes in a sourdough bread bowl. She was having a really hard time cutting up the bread, having tried my dad's steak knife unsuccessfully. Finally, in desperation (don't get between a person and their carbs)... she says, "Oh well... I paid for it," and picked it up and ate it like a cookie. Not at all funny until you realize that the bowl was about twice as big as her face... 3. Kevin has started a tradition that we occasionally revisit. It's called "Make A Face Out of Your Garnish and Leftovers"... started long time ago. I considered it briefly, and then thought, nah, don't want to embarrass the folks (I'm not sure why I was worried, with Mom knawing at her bread bowl, but I was). So I just sat there, waiting for the check to come. About a minute and a half later, I look over and Mom is creating her own masterpiece! I was gone. I made my own, but deconstructed it before the waiter arrived. Even so, I unfortunately glanced over at mom as he was clearing, and attempted to hold my laughter in, but with no success.  Ah, to be a Rich. This is the good life.  Thanks for a great dinner Mom &amp; Dad. Keep rockin' the party. You psychos.

        Being a slightly more sensitive individual than some comes with its blessings and its curses. (I used to only see the curses, but I know that there are ways this temperament can be used). One curse of sensitivity is that you're forever feeling things deeply, thus keeping you constantly aware of  your  hurts,  your  excitement,  your  frustrations, and so on. It becomes hard to forget yourself... and if I'm really to follow Christ... I'm to deny [forget] myself, pick up my cross, and follow Him.

       CURRENTLY PLAYING:  Jamie Cullum - Twentysomething (Jazz... think raspy Harry w/ great keys... piano is hot again...)  Thank you Darcie for the heads-up!      From the title track... hmm...        After years of expensive education A car full of books and anticipation I’m an expert on Shakespeare And that’s a helluva lot But the world don’t need scholars As much as I thought...      Maybe I’ll go traveling for a year Finding myself or start a career I could work for the poor though I’m hungry for fame We all seem so different But we’re just the same...      Maybe I'll go to the gym So I don’t get fat Aren’t things more easy With a tight six pack? Who knows the answers Who do you trust I can’t even separate love from lust...      Maybe I’ll move back home and pay off my loans Working nine to five answering phones Don’t make me live for my Friday nights Drinking eight pints and getting in fights...      I don’t want to get up just let me lie in Leave me alone I’m a twentysomething      Maybe I could just fall in love That could solve it all For lots of us say that that’s enough There surely must be more...          Love ain’t the answer, nor is work The truth eludes me so much it hurts But I’m still having fun and I guess that’s the key I’m a twentysomething and I'll keep being me...

        *** If you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read further. No intentional spoilers, but anyway, it's been two weeks. You've had time. ***  The theater was nearly empty last night -- I had forgotten how nice it is to go on Thursday night rather than Friday night, especially when going solo. Going solo on a Friday night, while doable, is a tiny yet strong dose of heart torture. All the lovey dovey couples... it's like being on the Adkin's diet and visiting a chocolate shoppe. I actually quite enjoy going to the movies on my own... although I don't recommend seeing certain movies alone. (I went to see Castaway by myself on New Year's Day when I had gotten dumped for another chick on New Years Eve... NOT RECOMMENDED)  OK... in no particular order, why I loved seeing this fine movie.  1. It reminded me of the incredible power music has to evoke human emotion. As a musician and a worship leader, this was a great reminder. Music can soften the heart, strike sheer terror into it... and everything in between. Shyamalan always uses this tool to his maximum benefit. During the opening credits, the only thing filmed were trees (in black and white, also a nice touch)... but the music already had my heart pounding... it only grew stronger as the film progressed. And the violin music was lovely.  2. Three words. Bryce Dallas Howard. I'd never seen her in anything else. After this, I'm sure I'll be seeing her plenty. She played her rather complex character with all the necessary elements... innocence, gumption, honesty, vulnerability, bravery... what a good role to make your big debut with. And I liked the quiet commentary on how we see with much more than just our physical eyes.  3. Another element Shyamalan uses often is the power of mystery... what you don't see is as useful as what you do. What you don't see is terrifying or tantalizing, sometimes both. There are several points in this movie where I actually found myself craning my neck to see around someone or something... he doesn't just hand out the answer as a matter-of-fact. He makes you want it first.  4. Joaquin Phoenix, um, I love you. Seriously, though, Lucius (a Gladiator name, which tripped me out for a few) really is incredibly lovable in this movie. Quiet and considered a bit odd by those around him, he looks at life differently than others in the Village. But he also doesn't fear things the way the others do. And my heart skipped a beat during the scenes when he grabs Ivy's hand and leads her away from danger, continuing to grasp it even after the danger has passed. It hit me deeply. Isn't that what we want? Someone to grab our hand and not let go?

             Welcome call from Mom today after work: "Throwin' some chicken on the grill, want some?" And the peasant rejoiced. Nothing like heading over to the parent's place for some good eatin'. Not like they live far away (5 minutes)... I wonder why I don't head over and raid their fridge more often (evil plot forming...). Now that I haven't lived there in quite a while, I always feel nostalgic coming home, like when I used to visit Grandma's house. I am a sentimental freak. But honestly, I love coming home, whether I live three hours away or five minutes.    Above: The Rich Estate, in all its glory.          Above: My Dad... isn't he the cutest? I'm vain and cropped myself out... my lazy left eye was a little wonky, and I couldn't stand it.         Dad and I bonded for a bit tonight... we took out the tent in preparation for my camping trip, for two reasons: 1) to make sure everything was there (Kevo learned that the hard way), and 2) to make sure little miss blondie could set it up with little to no embarrassing failures. (We've been high-rolling in the tent trailer for the last decade... it's been a while since I've REALLY roughed it). About two seconds into setting up my  dome  tent... it occurred to me that if I were too stupid to figure  that  thing out, I didn't deserve to be camping. The real test will be building a fire... making food...  She can be taught!         This was tonight's sunset, near my apartment. Called Grandma, had a nice chat, watched a day of my life end. I love living here in the Pacific Northwest... nothing beats it.         Alrighty, off the see The Village... by myself... because I am brave.

        The five inches (wide) of space that blogger gave me was lovely, but I am just a little too longwinded and I had premonitions of people suffering finger cramps from having to use their mouse wheelie so much. Being concerned for the finger health of humanity, I, computer moron, figured out how to read and customize my html code. I've been upgraded to computer genius status, I'm sure of it...

        CURRENTLY PLAYING: Bic Runga - Beautiful Collision (gorgeous voice imported from New Zealand...)      I am unashamedly bookish. Always have been. I was one of those kids who regularly got in trouble for staying up too late READING, of all things (oh, the horror!). My parents could tell I was up by the light shining through the crack below my door, so I would stuff a towel in it to block the evidence... genius. Not much has changed. I've almost wholly given up fiction because I'll read straight through a book in one sitting because the suspense kills me (although I'm too stubborn to pull the "read-the-last-page-to-see-who-makes-it" trick). This habit is not healthy when I have to work a few hours later. The week I read The Brothers Karamazov (basically just so I could say I'd done it) was rather hellish. So I'm more of a non-fiction addict now.      Whatever speaks to me, I tend to pass on. Friends sharing struggles are sure to hear a bit of paraphrased wisdom I recently gleaned from the pages of a well-written book. I am the quote queen. Although the wisdom isn't mine (and I say so), somehow I am deemed somewhat wise as well... guilt by association, apparently.      So here are a few of my favorites. They're not my favorites because they were the most philosophically profound, or the most intellectually impressive... some of them I didn't even like at first. They are treasured because they spoke a language that, as far as I knew up til then, only existed in my thoughtful ramblings. For once I didn't feel odd or out of place. It was as if I'd lived in a foreign country all my life, and had suddenly happened upon someone speaking English. The kindred spirits I discovered in these pages gave me courage to be more true to my own heart and comfortable in my own skin than I'd ever been previously. Most of all, they revealed a grace I had never once imagined could be remotely possible, let alone available to me, a  human  human being...       So in a spirit of gratitude, here are a few I'd recommend:      1.  THE HUNGERING DARK & THE MAGNIFICENT DEFEAT by Frederick Buechner . Frederick Buechner is an essay writer, a preacher, a novelist. Many people are these things. What makes Buechner so unique and endearing to me is his unabashed honesty.       When I read Buechner for the first time, I felt relieved . Someone finally said it . It's ok to have questions. It's ok to doubt. It's ok to admit that there are parts of the Bible that don't make for neat &amp; easy Sunday School packaging, complete with a clear moral to the story. It's ok for my understanding of God to still be somewhat incomplete. I can still reach for Him, even in my ignorance.      Even more personally impacting, it was ok to admit  that I am still somewhat incomplete . For once, it was acceptable to still be human and clumsy. No need to "flip the switch" or convince the world I'm any more than what I am. At the same time these words freed me to be at rest in who I've become thus far, they pointed out that there yet remains a journey to be savored. People and friendships to be enjoyed. Life is to be lived, and every moment wasted is just that. I walked away wanting to REALLY LIVE, whatever that meant... and I've looked at my world differently ever since.       The Killing of Time     What a grim saying it is, if you stop to think about it, because the time you are killing, of course, is your own time, and there is precious little of it at that. One life on this earth is all that we get, whether it is enough or not enough, and the obvious conclusion would seem to be that at the very least we are fools if we do not live it as fully and bravely and beautifully as we can...          2. THOUGHTS IN SOLITUDE by Thomas Merton    You can't get much better than a modern-day Trappist monk. I still remember the first time I read it -- sitting in a Denny's a few blocks from my Bible college (anyplace with cheap coffee available 24 hours a day is a haven for me when I'm in student-mode). I hated this book the first time I read it, because it was so hard to wrap my head around. I would read an entire page and then wake up, thinking, what the heck did I just read about? I had Eileen, my waitress, bring me more coffee and buckled down, determined to finish the book so I could write my paper and be done with it. And then I came to this prayer, and tears welled up in my eyes as I sat there in my booth:

        God normally gives me something everyday that I can laugh about. He started quite early today.  I had a weird dream that woke me up at 5.45 am, so getting to the gym this morning was no problem. (Two days in one week... not since college have I been so dedicated...)  So I did all my cardio, (I love those ellyptical runners - awesome), worked my legs, and then went over to the ab weight machines. There, I met Muscle Man Number One. I'm not trying to be mean, but what a freak show! (Muscle Man Number One probably goes to your gym too). He struts about like a peacock and his spandex workout shorts and gym tank top (complete with large hole in front, just to show you how long he's been dedicated to lifting). The strutting, I didn't really notice at first. (at the gym, it's not like strutting is rare).  It was more the ungodly noises he was making over on the glute machine that got my attention. Muscle Man sounded like he was giving birth. Natural childbirth, with no painkillers. He could teach cavemen how to communicate, his grunting was that good.  I'm thinking to myself, "Now how am I supposed to do crunches on this machine with that sort of thing going on?" The only muscles I was really working were my facial muscles... trying not to burst out in laughter. (I didn't dare laugh. He could, literally, break me in half. I would like to stay on good terms with MM)  He left the machine, and I resumed my crunches, happy that I could once again suffer in silence. However, as he strutted past, he continued to moan, groan, and grunt! As if walking, too, were hard work for such a muscle man as he. Back and forth he went, back and forth. Even his breathing was obnoxiously loud.  At this point I sort of gave up any hope of a decent workout. Luckily, however, he soon moved on to his natural habitat (translation: the bench press bar) where others of his kind could grunt in unison.  Which brings me to my first question of this morning's post, especially for you men out there:  Does all that moaning and groaning  actually help your workout?   Because I'm strongly considering trying it. Anything for my health. Anything.  Second lovely part of my gym visit: Enter Muscle Man Number Two. (I just had an unfortunate Austin Powers reference bolt through my mind... moving on). I'll just give you the conversation. Keep in mind that I don't get pretty for the gym. I roll out of bed, wash my face, brush my teeth, and attempt to tame my unruly curls (translation: I wad my hair up in ridiculous pigtailish things). Keep in mind also that I'm not trying to sound like a vain jerkface, like I get hit on often. Trust me. It's rare. When I do get hit on, it normally takes a slightly embarrassing route, a-like so:  MM2: (mid-strut) Tuesday, is it? Me: What? (thinking, it's Wednesday... what on earth?) MM2: Your name's not Tuesday? Me: Nope. (grateful my name's not Tuesday) MM2: Well your Tshirt says... Me: (having totally forgotten I was wearing my Late Tuesday Tshirt) OH... no, it's the name of a band from up in Bellingham. ( Why the heck would I wear a Tshirt that had my name and the word "late" above it. LATE STACEY... "Stacey, is it?" ) MM2: Oh, cause, you know, sometimes people have their names... on their shirts...(trailing off)... Me, inwardly: W hat on earth?  MM2: So you do you live up there? Me: (dismayed that this is now a conversation) No, I lived up there for a while when I went to school. MM2: Oh. Right on. So you live here now. Me: Yup. ( don't ask me for my real name... don't ask me for my real name...)  MM2: So if your name's not Tuesday, what is it? Me:  DANG IT!  I'm Stacey, nice to meet you. MM2: Nice to meet you. (strut continues). Me: (trying not to turn red and just get back to my stinkin' workout...) ENTER MUSCLE MAN NUMBER THREE (in way too short, tight, bright electric blue cutoff sweatpants)!!! Muscle Man Three actually didn't freak me out so much, except for the shorts, I think he was just trying to be nice, because I was sort of embarrassed. MM3: You gotta watch out for that guy... he's so smooth... really smooth, that guy is. Me: awkward laugh... MM3: OH, I'm John, by the way... Me: I'm Stacey, nice to meet you. MM3: Nice to meet you.  Making my escape to my car: MM3: (as he's jogging by) Have a great day! MM3: You too, John. You too.  So apparently my appeal has expanded from 18 year olds, to include Muscle Men! SCORE!  Which leads me to my second question:  What are the WORST pickup lines you've ever heard? Or used? Ever called a girl by a word on her Tshirt?  Curiosity is killing me.  Have a great day - may yours be filled with laughter, as mine already has been.

         CURRENTLY PLAYING: Frank Sinatra - Classic Sinatra: His Great Performances (excellent collection, by the way)   There is something seriously wrong with the world at large. Or with me. It must be the world at large. (makes sense, right?)  The question of the evening:  DO I LOOK SEVENTEEN? DO I?  Sigh.  The last few years, I've kind of gotten used to having to explain to folks that see our pictures that no, I'm not the younger sibling... Just because Kevo's a big moose does not make him an older moose.  Lately, however, it's just been downright spooky. I visited a friend's youth ministry, and I kid you not, on two separate occasions, students came up to me and said, "So what grade are you in?" "Well, I was a senior about six or seven years ago..."  enter awkward silence as dude, she's old! sets in > I had to laugh...  Tonight I was hanging out some of my high school girls. One mom truly thought I was seventeen years old. Seventeen. I could see mistaking me for 21 or 20. That's only a good three or four years off. But seventeen? When I'm sitting there with two sixteen year olds &amp; Kara (21)? Weird. I know I was being my slightly goofy, sarcastic self, but don't think I was overtly immature... I save that for summer camp.  I really thought I was coming along in the world... it had been about a year since I've gotten ID'd for a  movie ... people don't give me funny looks at my grown-up job anymore (what was hilarious was when I did loans at 19... people were so confused)...  And now, I'm back to "What grade are you in?" How did this happen? I don't read Tiger Beat, I don't have Justin Timberlake/Orlando Bloom posters on my walls, I don't look to Hillary Duff for fashion and makeup tips... (involuntary shudder)...  It's starting to make more sense why I'm more likely to get hit on by the 18-20 crowd than by those near my own age... or at least I'll just let myself think that (Kevin's reading this thinking:  yeah, sure Stace... whatever helps ya sleep at night) !  Maybe this lookingyoungerness will stick around til I'm forty and then people'll mistake me for thirty... I'd be for that. Til then, I'll keep bringing my driver's license to the movies.  So what makes a person an official grown-up? Suggestions?   HA HA... Young at Heart just came on... "Fairy tales can come true/it can happen to you/if you're young at heart..." Gotta love the Voice!

        I think there might be something seriously wrong with me. Little Miss Hits-her-snooze-thirty-times has now been up and about for two hours.  Against my better judgement, 6.15 am saw me at West Coast Fitness. I decided last night (at DQ with our kids for the weekly after-service hangout time) that  today would be the day . Wasn't too sure of my determination though - I was sharing a blizzard with Lil at the moment...   Operation Prevent Ghetto Booty has begun.   And today  actually was the day ! I think June 15th or so was supposed to  be the day , and last Wednesday, also, but I wimped out in favor of sleeping for a few precious moments longer. So I'm pretty stinkin' proud of myself. It's nice to start out your week on a note of (even a small) victory.  I've now had breakfast, read my Purpose Driven Life for the morning (both things that NEVER happen)... I'm ready to rock n' roll.  I hope you have a great day, and that your eyes are open to God's blessings around you and the people around you (people you have an opportunity to serve and bless!).  We'll see how Day Two of OPGB goes. Scary.

          Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all out, just as they are, chaff and grain together, certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and with a breath of kindness blow the rest away. ~Dinah Craik     My friend Carly lives in L.A. Pursuing her dream of fashion design and marketing, she bravely moved away last September... and it hasn't been quite the same around here since. Famous for blurting out  whatever  it is she's thinking, but also famous for her huge heart, she's a bright spot in my life. Even from L.A., she beams a ton of love and encouragement my way.  At times, we are polar opposites, at others, we are so alike it's scary... One thing we share at the moment is a CRAZY schedule. We've been playing phone tag for about a month, long overdue for a "What happened?" "He said  what? " kind of talk.  I got a text message on my cell this morning - "Thanks for being so patient with me. Love you." Earlier this week, I received a ton of "I'm SO sorry... we'll catch up soons".  Although I appreciated her words, she's the kind of friend where no apologies are necessary. It's sweet of her to remind me she cares about us catching up, but she's on a rather short list of people who have already proven they care -- through fighting and making up -- through listening to all the details of my rather nonexistent love life -- through wanting to know the details, even if it means a LONG talk -- and who love me enough to just really listen and laugh with me.  Everyone has a battle they fight in life, and mine has been a bit of self-condemnation with a dash of social anxiety. Most people laugh if I reveal this -- because from a distance, I come off as confident and sure of myself. Especially from the distance of the stage. Watching me behind a guitar or a keyboard, most never know that it is a sheer act of will and leap of faith for me to get up there. It seems the the things we're most passionate about - for me, worship - sometimes take the most courage to pursue.  God is growing me... hopefully it won't always be this scary.  As I've gotten older and understood my heart and mind a bit more clearly (and most of all, how God already sees me in His grace), it's gotten easier, and second-guessing thoughts don't hold me back in the ways they used to. Even so, it is a beautiful rarity to find someone with whom I'm genuinely comfortable. Where I don't have to weigh my words, where I don't have to think through  how will I come across if I share this part of me ...   I can just BE.  Such freedom. Such uninhibited joy. These are the gifts my friends bring to me.  Carly, you are beautiful and kind and have no reason for apologies. Whether it's this week or a month from now, our catch-up talk will happen, and I'm looking forward to hearing all the little details, all the ups and all the bummers. Thank you for being my friend. Thank you for letting me be me and for loving me for it. Never feel like you're not missed up here.  There are others -- You know who you are -- please know as well how precious you are to me. I try to say it often -- but I guess one more time can't hurt. You are loved.

       Kids make you dumber.  Proof positive - WWIII last night.  Objective: Bedtime.  I failed miserably.  But laughed all the way home.  I got SO scammed...      Me:  OK, Wolfie, it's time for bed... (birthname: Wolfgang, just in case you were confused)   W:  But, um, but um, Miss Stacey, I want to read another story.   Me: (not really minding, having felt guilty about the ten-pager I just read him) OK.    story read, pj's on, CD playing, nightlight on, special blankie in place...    Me:  OK, time for bed...   W:  But is it dark outside?   Me:  It will be soon.  Hop on up there.   W:  But mommy and daddy will wake me up after I've had  one rest , right?   Me:  Yes, they will.    W:  I want my mommy and daddy  now.     Me:  ( dang it)   They'll be home soon.  But you have to rest first.  You don't have to sleep, you just have to lie down and close your eyes for a while.   W:  OK.  ( as I   almost reach the door)   But Miss Stacey!  MISS STACEY!  Come back!   Me: What?   W:  You forgot to sing and pray.   Me:  (like I'm going to squelch a child's spiritual development... MAN this kid is good)  Jesus loves me this I know...   ( song and prayer done)     Me:  OK Wolfie, I think you're all covered.  Goodnight!   (beating a quick path to the door, shutting it, making it halfway down the stairs)     W:  MISS STACEY!  MISS STACEY!!!!!!  (wails, crying)    Me:  What, Wolfie?       W:  You didn't hug   me!     Me:  Yes I did.  Two minutes ago.      W:  No you didn't.   Me:  Yes I did.  I remember.   W:  No you didn't (puppy eyes, aligator tears).    Me:  OK, climb back up there, and you'll get ANOTHER hug.   (You are scamming me, and I know it, but what else am I going to do?  I can hear it now: "Mommy, Miss Stacey wouldn't hug me goodnight!")     W:  OK.    (hug given, almost to the door)    W:  (whimpery voice)  Miss Stacey, can you make me warm and cozy?   Me:  Sure.  It's eighty degrees in here, but let me tuck you in all nice and warm.    (five minutes pass...)    W:  MISS STACEY YOU FORGOT TO TURN ON THE FAN!    (turn on the fan)    W:  Stacey, will my mommy and daddy wake me up after I've had  one rest , right?  Yep, they'll wake me up...    Me:  Yes.       (five minutes pass)    W:  Miss Stacey, I have to go potty.   Me:  No, you don't.   W:  Yes I do.   Me:  You went ten minutes ago.  I heard you.   W:  No I didn't.   Me:  Yes, you did.   W:  But I have to go again!   Me:  No you don't.  Back in bed.   (and my life has reached a new low... I'm arguing with a four year old about his bladder)   I don't really think you need to go, I think you're trying to stay up longer... back in bed.   W:  OK.   ( pause)    W:  Can I have a drink of water?

          CURRENTLY PLAYING:  Emerald Isle ... relaxing irish music... ahh...         Is it Friday 5 pm yet? Please? ( I could power a small city with my whining...)  I be exhausted already. Really just feels like last week never ended... it was just extended by four days. Took some time tonight to relax and decompress. Watched  13 Going on 30 ... one of my new favorite chick flicks. (Kevin is enjoying the movie now as we speak... I swear, Jennifer Garner could star in a movie with Barney, and as long as she's in it, he'd watch it) Then made tea and had Lili over for a little venting/laughing.       Hopefully the time I took to slow down will show up in how I feel tomorrow, because today, truth be told, I was sorely tempted to punch something/someone in the face. Things get crazy all at the same time, you know? Crazy schedule, crazy boss, crazy load on your plate...        Lately, Lil and I have a new way of expressing this stressed feeling. It's probably not the most PC thing to do, but it's just between us, and it conveys more than words ever could... make a gun out of your fingers and either put the gun in your mouth or aim it at your temple. Isn't that sick? But in some very sad way it totally makes us laugh and cheers us up. It's our little reminder that no matter how stressed out we are, in the grand scheme of things, it just really isn't that bad. It all will pass.       Our circumstances, uncomfortable though they may be, are hopefully growing us and shaping us more into the women we want to become... All I know is, I'm blessed in the fact that I have a friend along in this internship that I can be real with, who stands by me even when I suck, and who finds my little comments amusing. I'm lucky.      I don't really have anything goofy to say or even remotely profound... I'm too tired. I'm finding that some days are just about continuing to move forward, even when you really don't feel like it, even when baby steps are all you can manage. Today, they were really all I could manage. (Is managing not to pitch a fit at work when things weren't going well considered a baby step? I hope so.)      OK I'm gonna go chat with the brothership before crashing.   Hope your week's going well, and if it's been more on the bummer end of the scale, like mine has been... just remember... SERENITY NOW! (if SERENITY NOW makes no sense to you, do me a favor and watch a bit o' Seinfeld, wouldja?)
