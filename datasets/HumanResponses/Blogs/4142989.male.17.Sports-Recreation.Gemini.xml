      This is going to be my last post because blogs are too open to misinterpretation. And they can offend people when there not meant to. So I'm going to play it safe and stay the hell away from them. Cheers, and I'm out.

      A great friend is the most wonderful and special thing in the world, it's someone you can talk to about anything and feel comfortable telling anything to (well, maybe not everything). It's someone you care about and you know cares about you, someone who will stand up for you no matter what you've done. Yep, a great friend is truely a wonderful and amazing thing to have. Unfortunetly though, the closer you are to someone, the more hurtful things they do become. A few days ago I made the stupid mistake of telling my friend is she didn't want to be somewhere why not just go do something you want to do. Sounds like a pretty harmless thing to say right? Guess not, anyways, this said friend is pissed. Her and her other friend were in a bad mood and I thought it was because they didn't want to go somewhere were I was going, so I pretty much told them if they didn't want to go just go do whatever they want to do. Now, I'm not really going to justify why I said this, because I didn't mean it as a personnal attack or anything remotely like that, I just figured they'd have more fun somewhere else, plus it was my girlfriends birthday and I figured it'd be better if the two people in a bad mood were elsewhere. Well, anyways, this friend said she was deeply hurt because it was her best friends birthday, well jeez, if it's your best friens birthday, don't at least pretend to have fun for her sake instead of being a funsponge. Now this is probably the first time my friends actually killed the fun out of something, normally she is the most upbeat and fun person to hang out with, but I'm not going to lie, and this dreadful day, she was kinda sucking up the fun. Now, I'm not going to pretend that I've never done anything like that, she pointed out that I've fallen alseep during movies and playing sardines. Which is a pretty good point, but you've gotta look at the whole picture, I play a game I hate playing because I know other people like playing it, although I don't really play it with any enthuisasm, which would make me the secretive type of fun sponge. Another thing, I work, not too many hours a week usually, but sometimes I do work a lot, and it can really wear me out, so I can get pretty tired, and not everyone gets to sleep in on weekends or weekdays, some of us work (not my friend here though). When she starts working and starts spending more time working then sleeping on weekends then I'll let her blast me all she wants to about falling asleep, until then, give it a rest, you have no idea where I'm coming from. Now what really bothered me about her being mad, I can accept that fact that she wouldn't like being called a fun sponge, even if it was a onetime thing. But what really hurts is how personnal she took it and how mad she got ("fuck fuck fuck you" thats pretty strong). Another thing she brought up also got me a little confused, she took it very personal and said how I called her and her friend a funsponge in my little blog about funsponges (read it again, point out your name and then I'll shut up). There actions inspired me to write about it, but I mainly wrote about it because of  things I do  and my bro (whos an awesome guy, but can be a funsponge) does, not about her and her friend. Now, I can totally understand her being mad about me implying she was being a funsponge, but it pisses me off when anyone, not just her in particular, blows something way out of proportion. I asked her to do what she wanted to do then wrote a blog about funsponges and all of sudden I've "totally just hurt [her] feelings" ? Kick me because I'm confused on this one. Now this blog has been directed at my good (hopefully still) friend, and normally I don't do this, so I'll try and put a little moral on the end of a story. Whenever your mad at someone, think about exactly what they said, not what they didn't say or what you thought they meant by something. Next, think why they might say something like that or what you were doing when they said that. Now, if you attack someone think about exactly what your saying, if it's kinda of a sketchy argument then don't say it, it will only make you look angry (which you probably are so you could just stick with it). And finally, try and keep it as drama free as you can when dealing with guys, guys hate drama, and were not good at saying what we actually feel so it's really hard for us to express ourselves and work through stuff. Now, for the ending of my story, I'll phone up my good friends and sort this whole big stupid mess out and some other stuff thats been bugging me in regards to her. For everyone out there, never ever make things personnal when there not meant to be. Another thing, never say you don't care how someone you "care" about feels when you say stuff. If your a good friend you should care how they feel and how they react to things. Cheers, Mick  P.S What the hell does climbing a fence have to do with anything, maybe she wants a medal...

      I'd like to think I'm good at reading people and determing what type of mood there in, so usually I can tell if someones in a playful, happy, sad, frusturated, or angry mood. Well, anyways, tonight someone I really care about seemed to be in a sad/angry mood, anyways, usually with people I care about I assume that it somehow was caused by me in some way or another, espically if they don't come out and tell me whats up. So, I think I did something wrong and I'm not sure what, but I've got a few ideas kicking around. Now, its probably no biggie, and I'm probably just overeacting but I get really worried when stuff like this happens and I'm not sure why. Maybe its that I'm afraid of losing that person or maybe its just that I read into things way to much (maybe I'm becoming more of a girl). Anyways, thats all I have to say, I think more about it and maybe it will all make sense in the morning. Cheers, I guess, Mick

      So, whats a funsponge? A funsponge is anyone who sucks the fun out of something, so today for my blog I'm going to educate you, the reader, on all the different ways you can be a funsponge and the many different types of funsponges. First I'll tell you about the most obvious type of funspone, which I'm going to call the no enthunsium and willingness to try things funsponge. These people decide that something is going not going to be fun and then refuse to take any part in the activity. Usually these people haven't even tried the activity or food or whatever is going on. Unfortunetly usually this said person is the sixth person in flashlight tag or sardines or whatever game or activity were playing and we kinda need them to complete the activity. Anyways, don't knock it till ya try it, so for those funsponges try something new, who knows, you may have fun. Now for the second more secretive type of funsponges, these people would rather being doing something else but they decide to come along and join you in whatever activity your doing just because there too lazy or too stubborn to do there own thing. Because they didn't get there way they act really down and really bummed out, even passive aggressive. Now because they come along with you on your activity they can sabotage the fun if they don't cheer up. O, and the other thing, when you point out that there pissed off or that they should just do what they want they get even more mad. So, how do we deal with these funsponges, just distance yourself from them and try and ferget they are with you until they cheer up. So, for all you secretive funsponges out there, if you'd rather do something else then do something else, but if you chouse to come along then cheer or at least pretend to be okay with whatever is going on. I think that pretty much covers the types of funsponges, I guess there only two types that I can think of. Now I should make a little note that there are people out there who are almost like anti-funsponges, these people are so easy going and accepting of whatever is going on that they can make anything fun. I'd say that my girl is one, and definetly KP, however, I think that all my friends are easy-going and they can all be like this, but I've never ever seen KP do anything remotely funspongy, if thats a word, so I would say shes the anti-funsponge. I think the only bad thing about KP is that she won't make a decesion to save her life, and its hard to tell if she wants to do something are not, so I think one day all of my friends and myself should all hang out and do whatever KP wants to do, let her make all the decesions. Cheers, Mick

      Now, I'm a pretty paranoid guy to begin but when I get tired or bummed out then I get super paranoid, so naturally I hate secrets. Usually I go over and its all like "Don't worry, were not talking about you." But if your not talking about me why do you stop talking when I walk over and start laughing? Interesting... Anyways, I don't really like secrets, and I don't really get mad when people talk about them, I just think if your going to talk about people without them knowing just do it were no one can hear or see you whispering stuff. I just kinda went over my blog a second ago and I think I'm too paranoid, the secrets thing isn't a big deal it just kinda bothers me sometimes. However, not everythings bad these days, I had a pretty amazing weekend (other than work), and today is my girls 17th birthday, so things are looking good. Unfortunetly I got to work all day tommorrow and I've got driving lessons tonight and another night this week. The weather is good though, and the river would be pretty sweet today so I think I'll head down there. Cheers, Mick

      So far today has been one of those days, the days you wish you could just erase or do over. I had to leave my girlfriends house early last night so that I could wake up and be at work 6:15, but today, when I got there they told me there was a schedule change so they didn't need me till 8:30. So I walked home and tried to get back to sleep, but I couldn't because of these really annoying birds, so when I walked back down to work I was feeling pretty pissed off. Lessons went well but the public swim was brutal, lots of young kids who couldn't swim and really really really stupid parents letting the kids do really stupid things. I stayed an extra hour (till 3:30) because the public swim was so bad. Anyways, then I went for drive and got home and slept, now I'm about to head over to my girlfriends house for her party. Unfortunetly I probably have work tommorrow at 7:45 so its going to be another early night, which sucks. In other news a sorta bad ending spoiled what would have been an amazing night, it still was a great night, but the ending wasn't that great. Anyways, time to have fun and hopefully change my day around. Cheers, Mick

      So far this summer one of the biggest things I've noticed is the difference between guys and girls. The first difference between guys and girls is time. Guys just seem to be able to get ready and go places in way way way less time then it takes girls. If a guy has to he can be woken up and out of the house in about five minutes, whereas girls seem to need at least an hour before there ready to go. What they do in this hour of time remains a mystery to me, I think it could have something to do with masturbation... Just joshing. Anyways, some girls can get ready really quickly and even the slower girls have been quick sometimes. Guys are also much more effiecient shoppers then girls, which is weird because guys never go shopping and pretty much without exception we hate shopping. When I've been shopping with girls they don't really seem to have any idea what they want to get and just go to look at stuff (wheres the fun in that?), but as one of my good friends put it, "all the fun in shopping is going to different stores and trying stuff on." To each his own I guess, cause shopping isn't fun, although the last time I went I actually enjoyed it, but thats probably because things were running smoothly and I knew what I was looking for. Anyways, I think that girls should just hire guys to shop for them, that way they'd save time they could be using to get ready, just joshing. Another difference between guys and girls is the "big deal" and "complicated" stuff. Most people think us guys are simple creatures, which for the most part is true, however, us guys can be very complicated when we want to be and when it concerns certain issues. For example, lets say a guy wanted someone to come over, but they didn't want that person to come over unless they wanted to, that said guy would ask the girl if she wanted to come over but act like he didn't really care what happened, pretty confusing stuff eh! For the most part everytime a guy tries to be complicated and tricky his plan backfires and he ends up feeling stupid. But for the most part guys are pretty simple, we say what we mean (most of the time) and usually don't sugar coat anything (just look at BC). Girls on the other hand, tend to make things complicated when they don't have to be, they over anaylze things, try and get meaning out of meanless stuff, hold grudges agaisnt people who are trying to set things right, say they don't care about something that bothers them, or don't do what they want to do. Now for the big deal stuff, for the most part guys make big deals out of relationship issues and really important stuff could actually effect people, the rest of the stuff we don't really care to much about and usually just drop things or give in during arguments or discussions (we don't really think your right when we do this, but we just do this because we know its no biggie). Girls, on the other hand, can make big deals out of anything, and when they try and argue they don't tend to make any sense (At least to me), for example, I'll give a scenerio: Say there is a hot spoon on the table, they would pick up the spoon knowing its hot and then when they got burned they'd get mad at the person for leaving the spoon out, JUST DON"T PICK UP THE SPOON YDB. That little story didn't really make a lot of sense, but theres actually some weird deeper meaning and parrallels to real life events hidden in the story. Anyways, this little comparison kinda turned into a little rant so I've kinda gotta cover my ass and say some truthful stuff that won't offend anyone. There are no girls I know that always make things complicated or  do anything of the stuff I just said all the time, and there are some guys who take there sweet time and make things complicated when they aren't (I should know because I make things complicated sometimes). So there are big exceptions to the whole comparison thing, but for the most part I think its sort of accurate. Everyone do a comparison of there own and tell me what they think the differences between guys and girls are, thanks. Cheers, Mick

      Well, today is the 11th of August and summer is half over. Back to school ads are popping up everywhere and the days are even getting shorters (its dark out by (9:30). So you'd think with my favorite time of the whole year coming to an end I may be bummed out. Well, not this year, so far my summers been great and I've done lots of fun stuff (like learning to ride the bus, just joshing, that wasn't really fun). I've also got a feeling that the rest of the summer is gonna be awesome as well. Unfortunetly I'm going away at the end of August cause I really wish I could spend the rest of summer with my friends and girlfriend, but hey, the OK is a fun place and I'm sure it'll be great. The driving lessons suck big time though, there super boring and we are pretty much just going through a book and watching really really lame videos, pretty crappy eh. But those lessons are only six hours outta the whole week. Also I'm subbing down at the pool so it looks like the next six days are gonna be pretty busy. Which doesn't really bother me cause the moneys great and I love being busy, although a relaxing night or day every now and then is great as well (as long as its fun). A lot of people are coming and going these days and its kinda been hard to keep in touch with all the people I would have liked to keep in touch, I'm not too worried about this because I've seen lots of my best buddies all summer. Just gotta get some more alone time with my girl and then lifes pretty much perfect for me. Yeah, this has been a great summer so far and the next half of it should be just as great. Hope everyones summers been great. Cheers, Mick

      I don't really have anything to write about tonight so I'm just going to fill you in with whats on my mind these days. Well, for starters last night was pretty fun, got stoned and watched Riverdance with Micheal Flattley, some crazy stuff. I also got to see a bunch of older people I used to play baseball with and hang out with way back in the day so that good. Anyways, what else happened that night... I won some money playing cards and my girl got mad at me cause she thought I was making fun of her, which I guess I kinda was (If you read this I'm sorry), but yeah, its all good, funny stuff. One of my good buddies is back from Mexico so I got to see her today which was great and yeah, things are good right now. Went shopping with my bud today for birthday stuff, which went pretty well actually. I think guys are much better shoppers than girls, cause were more effiecient and we always come out with what we wanted to get. So yeah, that was kinda weird spending the afternoon shopping but yeah, it was actually kinda fun today. Cheers, Mick

      Well, now that I've actually been stoned I have to say that weed is pretty good. I love the feeling of being drunk because you get both a physical and mental effect. Whereas I think weed is just mental, because when you focus really hard you can do things normally, except tie a tie. Tonight would be the second time I have actually been stoned and it was really fun. We hit out of a bong, which was a first for me and we even had ice cubes and all that in the bong. Weed is cheaper than beer but I think I may like being drunk better just because I cough with feed and my breathe gets pretty bad. You do feel really comfortable when your stoned though, its like your sitting by an open fire, the warmth tingling feeling all over your body, its a good feeling. Then your body feels really heavy and you sink into the couch. Anyways, we watched Riverdance with Michael Flattley and it was pretty good. Its been fun. Cheers, Mick

      Lately I've been thinking that maybe there are some things I should be doing that I'm not doing right now and that maybe I've made some wrong or stupid decesions that have got me in trouble. Should I think stuff through more? To be honest I ferget about stuff that I don't feel is a huge deal, however, what may be nothing to me could be a big deal to someone else, so I think i should think stuff through more and maybe do less stuff for me. I don't really wanna be everything to everyone and have to be more restricted on what I can do and say but I'm thinking it may be a good idea. I don't and I won't change how I think and how I feel to try and please everyone but it really gets me down when I piss people off or even if I think I pissed someone off. Maybe I care too much? But then again, maybe I don't. I don't think I should worry about it and maybe everything will seem clearer and simpler in the morning after work. Cheers, Mick

      Whats worse than two guys hanging out by themselves on a saturday night? Two lonely guys who miss their girls. My saturday night actually wasn't that bad, hung out with my good brown buddy and tossed back a few. Watched a movie that was so bad it was actually really fun to watch. Then hung out with my little bro and walked up with him and my bud to watch the fireworks from hill. The fireworks tonight looked pretty good but I got bored halfway through and started talking with my bud about how we could take a bunch of grade tens who were chilling up there with us (yeah, I'm not a very cool kid). That was all good, but talking with my bud about how things were going was not good. We pretty much just talked about how we would have much rather been with our girls and pretty much the same thing happened with him and that his girl went out with her friend and watched the fireworks. But hey, its all good, whats one night outta the whole summer anyways? But this night wasn't just any night and getting a phone call from them just twisted the knife (good use of an uncommon expression eh, but it kinda fits). The bad part was the more I thought about her, the more I wished I had gone to the fireworks so I could be with her, even though the fireworks are kinda boring and I gotta work early tommorrow morning. I guess my night was okay all in all, no parents so it was kind of fun to just be casual with our drinking (We even had the chilled glasses and everything). Although one of the beers I had tasted like mushed hamburger (never drink Granval Island Lager), but hey, even bad beers are good as long as you drink it fast enough that you only have to taste once. Anyways, I hope they all had a good one to make up for my night, but I guess life is all about balance. Which to me means that I have to have bad nights to make the good nights seem so special. Cheers, Mick P.S Me and my bud also talked bout the state of things in the group and certain issues that are coming up, but thats all on the downlow for now,

      I'm sitting on my computer at 5:34 PM, with nothing going on for me tonight, and for some strange reason I'm not worried. Now, I'm the type of person who gets bummed out when I don't do anything but tonight I'm totally fine with just chilling out and doing nothing. Sure, I'll probably call up someone if I get bored, but right now its all good. I'm missing out on probably what is going to be the best night of fireworks yet (with the good weather and it being the final one), but its all good right now. Anyways, I'm just thinking of stuff I could do tonight... I'll probably end up watching a few movies and sleeping (which I could really go for tonight), maybe I'll hang out with my little bro and watch the fireworks from the top of hill, not sure, maybe I'll just right some more blogs, I'll see how the night goes. Hope everyone out there has a good one. Cheers, Mick

      I was listening to an old Offspring song called One Fine Day, where the guy talks about his perfect day. This song got me thinking about how my perfect day would go. However, I'm gonna be realistic about this so I can't win the lottery and fly off somewhere tropical for my perfect day. So, if I had a perfect day, I would have it start this way... Wake up, feeling refreshed and ready to go, with the sun shining through the window. Have a shower and not run out of hot water. Meet up with my friends and girlfriend and head down for breakfast at Honey's Donuts. Then head down to the river, where it be just us and no one else there. Spend the day relaxing in the sun at the river and then head off with just my girlfriend for dinner somewhere. Then meet up with everyone and hang out and play pool and listen to music at my house for a few hours. After that we'd go out somewhere or go to someone's house and party. That'd be a pretty sweet day for me. How would your perfect day go? Cheers, Mick

      You know the ones I'm talking about, those lazy boring summer days where you don't feel like doing anything but you want to do something. Well, I've had two in a row and I think I'm gonna lose it if I have one more. So far this summer has been amazing, nothing boring, everythings been great, cept for one afternoon but the night was good. So yeah, you're probably wondering whats the big deal about two boring summer days, I mean, summer is 70+ days anyways right? So who cares if two of them sucked. Well, for me when I don't do anything I feel like I've wasted the day, and two days in a row, thats a lot time wasted. When I'm bored I start to get really bummed out, and I also get a little grouchy, so don't throw any F#$%ing footballs at my house. Anyways, I don't like being bummed out cause I think I bring my friends down when I'm down, which makes me feel even worse. Tommorrow better be amazing cause the weekend isn't looking to great (working both days), if tommorrow isn't great I think I'm gonna blow a funny fuse and go bonkers. Bonkers isn't really a word used by most big kids, but it kinda fits, well, not really. To finish off my whiny blog, I hope you never have to go through boring days of summer. Cheers, Mick

      Every once and a while during the summer I think about the coming school and it gives me shivers. This year, for me, will be the hardest and probably the most stressful year of high school yet. I've got a heavy academic course load and I'm taking Bio 12 and French 12, which are both really hard provinical examable courses. The work will be tough, but for me, the worst part is the stress of trying to do well enough to get into commerce at Queen's. The weirdest part is I don't really want to go all the way out to Ontario for school, I'd much rather go to SFU or UBC here in BC. I'm not sure why I feel pressured to go to Queen's because my dad said he didn't care where I went or if I went to university at all. Anyways, I'm also gonna be working a lot to get some money for school. So I think the thing I most worried about this year is not having the time to see the people I care about. This post is kinda boring, so I'm off and next time I'll think of something really cool to write bout. Cheers, Mick

      First things first, I love my friends and I'd do anything for them. There all great and amazing in their own ways. It these guys and girls who make my life so special and amazing. Pretty much to some up my friends there are three groups. The first group is the people I hang out with pretty much all the time. Everyone in the group is really open with each other and everyone is relaxed around each other. For the most part I could see these people 24/7 and never get tired of them. The second group of people consists of pretty much just one girl and whoever she happens to be hanging out with at the time. I love hanging out with her when I don't feel like doing anything or when I need a little break from some of the people from the first group. Some of my friends think she really boring, and I sort of do to, but it all depends on the mood your in, when you feel like just relaxing and doing nothing then shes the best person to be around. Also because I don't see her that often I don't really know her well enough to say whether she is boring or not, plus i don't think I've hung out with her in the daytime. Okay, the third and final group is the group of friends who I don't see very often and I always see them when I'm hanging out with friends from the first group. Anyways, thats all my friends. There are a few special friends in that first group who I'm gonna talk about a little more. The first is a girl who I feel comfortable telling her anything and everything, shes also really good at reading me if somethings wrong and she never bugs me. The second is another girl who I've pretty much seen all summer, I've been a lot of time with her and shes super nice, I've never met a nicer girl in my whole life. The third is a guy who I feel comfortable talking about issues and stuff with, hes a great guy and hes super fun to hang out with. The final person is my girl, shes amazing and I feel completely comfortable around her, she can read me better than anyone else and knows if somethings wrong, she also really cute. Anyways, thats my friends for ya. Cheers, Mick

      Now, I have pretty much no experience with weed, but I'm still gonna tell you about my limited experiences. Very wordy opener eh. Anyways, first off, my personal experience with weed if very limited. I've smoked up twice, but I haven't got stoned, I don't think I've even felt anything. So I was kind of dissapointed because I had heard it was really great. The only thing i felt was terrible breathe and like there was a mini fire in my throat. So from my experience weed kinda sucks, but I'm gonna gonna stick with it until I actually get stoned, then I can decide whether or not its good. Because I haven't written very much I'm gonna tell you about my friends experiences with weed through my eyes. Anyways, from what I can see, weed makes you tired, grouchy, relaxed, focused, very very not focused, cute, funny, extremly not funny but still think your funny,  embarassed, shy, outgoing, and many other things. So pretty much weed can make you feel anything and it really varies from person to person. One friend of mine gets super relaxed and is really really cool to be around when stoned. Another gets grouchy and goes through periods of being really quiet and then gets really weird. And finally my girlfriend has acted different every time, the funny thing though is she acts the same after everytime. She gets really embarrassed even though I don't care and I think she is fun to be around when stoned. O well, anyways, for those of you thinking bout weed, you pretty much never get stoned your first time, well I've heard of a few people getting stoned their first time, but everyone else didn't get stoned. And your first time it hurts like hell and you cough like inhaled a pine cone. You also get super super bad breath with really doesn't go away no matter how many pieces of gum you have. Also, for me, my second time I didn't get stoned either and I had quite a bit of weed, so I'm pretty sure it takes at least a couple times before you will actually get stoned. Anyways, if you like getting drunk, stick with that, if you're patient and you don't mind stinky breath and coughing, try weed out if you want, its cheaper than beer. Cheers, Mick

      Now for those of you who have been drinking you hopefully know what I mean when i say babysitter. The babysitter is that friend who doesn't drink but goes with you when you go drinking. They're there to have fun and keep everyone safe. There are a few rules that all babysitters should follow though. The most important rule is never to make the people drinking feel like there doing something wrong or that they're making you uncomfortable. So try not to look bored or uncomfortable and don't be critical of the people driking. However, if they are doing something wrong or something that makes you uncomfortable let them know about it, honesty is important, and your all friends anyways. Another important rule to being a babysitter is not to act stupid, if other people are acting stupid its because they're drunk so they have an excuse to act stupid, you're not drunk so you've got no excuse to act stupid. So never asks the people drinking stupid questions or try and get them to do stupid things. They may be too drunk to care about what your doing or saying at the time but they'll remember in the morning and be annoyed. A babysitter should also make everyone feel comfortable, sometimes people drinking can feel akward if you (the babysitter) are not drinking, so just grab a beer and spend the night sipping on it. When you're done with it just carry around the empty bottle and people will think your still drinking. If you really really don't want to drink just grab an empty and fill it with water, no one can tell whether or not its beer inside because of the coloring on the bottle. However, some bottles are clear so make sure you only use Smirnoff bottles to fill with water (cause all Smirnoff stuff is clear anyways). Follow these rules and you'll make everyone feel relaxed and you can also make sure they're all safe. Cheers, Mick

      About three months ago I had way to much to drink, seven beers and a shot of hard bar. Anyways I threw up a bunch of times and probably acted like a total idiot, but the worst part is not being able to remember doing anything of the things people said I did. Also thinking about how my friends and more importantly my girlfriend felt while I was passed out with vomit on my shirt. I guess I feel bad because i kinda killed there fun and they all had to take care of me instead of just enjoying there night. Eventually I was carried to another friends house were I video taped lying on a couch. I said some pretty stupid stuff that night I just kinda feel like a total dumb ass. The worst part about the whole thing was not being able to tell people about what happened because i couldn't remember. I also have this one friend who really really loves to talk and tell stories, he also likes to kinda bs a bit with his stories, so anyways, this friend went a told bunch of people about it and yeah, I'm sure it wasn't as bad as he said it was, but I just couldn't remember, and so I couldn't tell him he was wrong or it wasn't as bad as he was saying. Now the point of my story is that when you go out to drink or toke or whatever your into, don't get so retarded that you can't tell people about what happened. Pace yourself with your drinking and don't try and show off by drinking a lot, its not a competition, and your there to have fun, and trust me, hangovers suck the big one, so drink responsibly. Also, never get drunk around people who are not drinking, its always good to have a sober person to help out if things get too bad but you can make them feel uncomfortable or bored. So back to my story, ever since that night drinking I haven't gotten drunk, I've gotten buzzed but never drunk, and I think I'm almost afraid of getting drunk again. Which really sucks cause if your "good" drunk then its a blast. Anyways, enjoy your booze but be responsible. Cheers, Mick
