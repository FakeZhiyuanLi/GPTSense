      There are three writers whose style I admire greatly.  Michael Flinn, James Jordan, and NT Wright.  Each writes clearly, with great knowledge, and yet humbly, without provocation.

      Good Morning. On this here bright morning in Hamilton I begin my final post in New Zealand.  My plane leaves this evening at 17:55.  Soo much has happened in the past year in preparation and I have been blessed tremendously.  I feel that a lot of people have been touched through the preparation too, and I want to say "Thank You" to all of you who have been there for me.  It is now exciting while being nervous at the same time.  Time really has kept flying by.  In saying that it will also pass quickly while I am over there and will be soon back!  I pray for you here in New Zealand and my thoughts will often stray back here while I am on the other side of the world.  I finish this post with a priestly blessing: "The LORD bless you and keep you;  the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you;  the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace." Numbers 6:24-26.  God Bless you all!!

      Greetings from Hamilton.  Just 3 more days till I leave the country!  Just three more days.  These last few weeks have just flown by.  Bringing you all up to speed with the last few days, there was a party held on Saturday night as a farewell to myself.  The theme was bad taste (and there were some real good or should I say bad characters there!) and a heap of people turned up for it from Avondale, Bucklands Beach, Mangere, Pukekohe, Hamilton, Hastings and as far afield as Wellington area.  It was an enjoyable night and one I'll treasure overseas.  The following morning there was a dedication service at Aberdeen where the session officially sent me on my journey.  It was truly a blessing that service where we could all draw encouragement and strength together.  It is an emotionally draining experience seeing all my friends for the last time for a year.  However we will meet again in a year DV.  The last couple of days now will be taken by packing and tidying up the last loose ends.  I fly out at 5:55pm on Thursday so will be around at the airport from about 3 till just before 5. Thus ends my preparation for this journey and now have to take the step of faith into the unknown overseas.  I thank you all who have been there for me and pray that you may be blessed and strengthened in the Lord.  God be with you till (and after) we meet again Hayden

      "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven."  Ecclesiastes 3:1  I begin this musing by looking at one of the most contentious books of the Bible.  This is an intriguing passage as it then talks about all the activities under the sun (including war and peace etc.)  That aside I believe that we all have times set in our lives.  At times we are very stable in what we do and where we are (which is good for raising families) , other times we are restless and searching.  Often we don't know what it is either.    My search has led me to believe that God is leading me over to Ecuador to serve Him there.  Many of you reading this will know that.  Some of you may not, so to fill you in I am going to Ecuador to serve over there for just under a year.  I leave in 9 days aaarrrrghh!  I am real excited to go, but it is also coming up really quickly!  I am generally ready to go - I have my passport and all my Visas ready, but then again I am not.  Makes sense?    I look forward to reading your replies etc. as we go on this adventure together.  God Bless you richly in your lives Hayden

      Buenos Dios mis amigos! Greetings from the centre of the world.&nbsp; How are you all?&nbsp; Thanks again for all your emails, it is overwhelming to receive them (and trying to answer them!)&nbsp; Well, where do I begin?&nbsp; Every week I seem to do more and experience more than a year in NZ.&nbsp; I had my introduction into Ecuadorian culture on Saturday when we went down to the central park for a picnic.&nbsp; We began by setting up a badminton court and having a game.&nbsp; Soon afterwards some local boys came up and challenged us to a game!&nbsp; Bad move... for them!&nbsp; There were four of our team against four of them and we managed to beat them by a goal or 2.&nbsp; It was sooo much fun, but boy was I tired after that!!&nbsp; Something about running around at ~3000m above sealevel.&nbsp; We also played wiffle ball (sorta like baseball but with plastic bat and ball).&nbsp; Sunday was really amazing too.&nbsp; We went to the church there.&nbsp; I had Paul beside me (he has been to Ecuador before) and he translated the songs.&nbsp; I love their songs and singing.&nbsp; It is refreshing to hear another people praising God.&nbsp; The message was presented in a powerpoint projection.&nbsp; I couldn't understand much though.&nbsp; Monday we began language training.&nbsp; This involves class from 8:30-12:30 every week day.&nbsp; We then practise during the afternoons.&nbsp; Soon the 5 of us (BJ, Andi, Kevin, Joshua and I) will be in smaller classes during the morning or afternoon.&nbsp; The first couple of afternoons was spent taking siestas (a most excellent thing if I have to say so) and doing homework.&nbsp; I also saw some cheesy batman movie (with the ol' pow, whack)&nbsp; Thursday was a real emotional day.&nbsp; After Spanish class and lunch we went to South Quito where Patrick our leader will be working.&nbsp; Where we are staying is about central to North Quito.&nbsp; Here it is quite affluent.&nbsp; However an hour bus ride in which we saw beautiful universities/cathedrals and a large statue of the Virgin Mary and through long tunnels (with no ventilation) we came through the old city which has beautiful cathedral by some plazas and to the south.&nbsp; The south end of the city I felt was more 'real'.&nbsp; Whereas in the north we were isolated a lot and very much in a western culture the south was a lot more natural.&nbsp; I was struck by the number of unfinished houses.&nbsp; I even saw cows grazing among them!&nbsp; The work we did at Patricks church was well, (no laughing) construction.&nbsp; I helped denail timber (and didn't break it) and then with Josh fixed up a cabinet with some sort of joining device.&nbsp; It was all manual work and I screwed everything in by hand - aint no drills for me!&nbsp; I even managed to mess it up considerably.&nbsp; I would measure to the middle of the catch on the frame and then put the top screw of the catch on the door at the same level.&nbsp; It took me a while to figure out what was wrong!!&nbsp; After we finished working we had some drink and bread with a few of the men and ladies there.&nbsp; It is hard not being able to talk much to them when there is so much I want to say.&nbsp; They would often look at one of us and laugh.&nbsp; All I could do was quietly laugh knowing one day I will be able to get it!!&nbsp; The bus ride home was longer too cos we were too late for regular buses and had to take a trolley.&nbsp; It was fun but we didn't get back till about 10:00 pm.&nbsp; The bus rides were interesting also because I travelled with a saw.&nbsp; I just took it on as if it were nothing.&nbsp; On the way back we had to fight to get off the bus cos there were lots of people on it, that made it somewhat interesting getting off the bus!&nbsp; (I didn't hurt anyone, honest)&nbsp; The other thing that I was struck by was the general sadness of the people.&nbsp; They seem to draw their beauty from some sadness, unlike what i am used too.&nbsp; Today we had Spanish again, it was hard cos we were tired from last night.&nbsp; In the afternoon, we had our first real Ecuadorian meal.&nbsp; We went to a restaurant and had a full lunch there for $2.50!&nbsp; It included a soup, main meal and dessert.&nbsp; I had some sort of cow intestines.&nbsp; Rather chewy but it was beautiful, drowned in a peanut sauce.&nbsp; Afterwards some of us went back to south Quito and carried on work there.&nbsp; The rest of us including myself helped one of the missionaries clean up her apartment as she is going to another city.&nbsp; This meant for me that I was washing windows all afternoon.&nbsp; I must say the life of a missionary is never boring!!&nbsp; Well, that brings you up to speed with the happenings.&nbsp; There seems to be heaps ahead as well including more soccer and mostly language learning.&nbsp; We are soon to kick it up a higher gear and start getting out more.&nbsp; Should be interesting too.&nbsp; Well, I am proud to say (though many of you may know) I am an uncle again.&nbsp; My sister Heidi gave birth to another boy called Levi Jackson Meinsma.&nbsp; He He He. God Bless and take care.&nbsp; 'Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling, and present you faultless in the presence of His glory with exceeding love.&nbsp; To the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion and power both now and forever, Amen.'&nbsp; Jude 24-25   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luis - Soli Deo Gloria -

      Hola mis amigos! Cockroaches, lots of cockroaches!  Spiders too, bit hairy yellow and white ones as well as little caterpillars with a nasty bite.  2oClock woken up by bats flying around... sound like a nice and pretty time to be spending?  Well, it sure was at Camp Pallatanga!  Welcome to this special and belated info.  As always, once again I have had a most enjoyable and challenging week.  This time we descended from the heights of Quito to a camp site in a valey by the town of Pallatanga (still over 1500m above sealevel).  More from me in a few minutes as I have dinner now.  Hello again.  Well, on to Pallatanga!!  'Twas a fine morning when we left.  After a bitsy breakfast and a scrambled lunch made for the bus ride and after helping to load up the car  that Mike and Bonnie went to camp in we went down to the trolli.  Pat and I had a run as we went to a post office so I could mail a letter then we met up with the others.  We bused across town to the terminal and then organised a bus to Rio Bamba.  This bus we did catch at a time somewhat after paying for it and we left.  It was beautiful to see the hills and mountains.  They were more often than not covered in cloud.  We passed through Latacunga where Kevin will be staying and then arrived at Rio Bamba.  In the distance was Chimborazo, for those of you who like trivia, it is the highest volcano in the world and also the furtherest from the centre of the earth/closest point on Earth to the sun.  It was mostly covered in cloud and I couldn't get a good picture of it either.  From Rio Bamba to Pallatanga the road was a lot narrower and windier, following up valleys and streams.  For most of the trip we were in the clouds and there wasn't much to see.  The actual drive was great - the bus driver took other buses and cars etc. on blind corners.  It helped me to pray more fervently - sometimes we would be just finished overtaking and a truck would drive past!  We arrived safely, and the scenery was just like New Zealand - Tall Mountains, steep hillls with a mountain stream rushing down the bottom of the gorge.  When we got to camp we had to clean up the camp for everyone.  We started with the dorm that some of the campers including us would be sleeping in.  Mike had already fumigated the dorm so when we went in and began to clean up there were cockroaches in the final throes of death, others dropping from the ceiling and generally hundreds dead.  There was even a bat dead and another one floating in the Girls toilets!  What fun we had in cleaning them up.  After a sleep with the cockroaches - Patrick literally slept with one - he rolled over during the night and in the morning found one squashed on his back and a leg in his bed.  We busied ourselves cleaning on the Sunday.  We had to clean everything in the kitchen and took turns washing and drying the stuff.  It was hard work but we really enjoyed it.  We went into the village for some lunch and had a free afternoon.  This was used for Spanish and other recreational activities like a mean game of indoor soccer.  Near the end of the day a family (of Kiwis too might I add) turned up to help with the clean up of camp, they werre the Pavelkas from Timaru.  We chatted and introduced the Americans to the idea of a rugby ball and how to pass and kick one!  A very enjoyable time.  The Monday was spent cleaning up again.  I helped Mark Pavelka doing some path clearing.  By morning tea we knew the insides of a weed eater like the back of our hand because we had to fully service it to keep it going.  Before we did it, the weed eater would work for about 15 minutes and then cut out.  It was also a good time of sharing with Mark as he is a real good guy too.  The afternoon was spent in various recreational activities namely soccer!!  Tuesday came around and we kept on cleaning, OK so some people kept on cleaning.  I spent some of the mornign knocking down lemons for some fresh lemonade for camp.  Also we had a lot of fun finishing clearing some paths with a diesel burnoff (remind me to show those pics back home!!)  The whole cleanup was a lot of fun interacting with the others and the Pavelka family.  By the end of Tuesday most people were turning up for camp and we got to change activities to more relaxed ones, no more back breaking work for us!!  We had introductions on Tuesday night and met most people.  Seeing it was a spiritual retreat we had a lot of sharing over camp and a lot of prayer time.  We also saw a series of videos by RC Sproul (a good reformed like theologan) about the holiness of God.  They generated a lot of talk and good intereaction.  ach morning we also heard the work that the Lord was doing in the main areas of Ecuador - namely Quito, Saraguro/Yangtzaza and Guayaquil.  The afternoons were pretty relaxed.  On Wednesday we had a good game of volleyball, on Thursday we went exploring and went to some waterfalls.  This was great fun, if slightly on the edge of the waterfall and a 10 metre drop right below us!  Friday I took real easy because I was real tired then.  There is a lot of rivalry b etween the men and women, it is quite funny - there were games of Trivial Pursuit and competitions to do a jigsaw puzzle quickest.  All in all it was a very refreshing time meeting all the missionaries and fellowshipping with them.  I could keep going on but it I wont!  The trip back today was good, much the same as the trip there, there was a lot of cloud and rain.  The final part of the trip the bus showed Face-Off.  Not exactly an enticing movie for travel!  It certainly didn't help me to sleep.  Well my friends, I am going to sign off here.  It has been a real blessing to share this with you and hope you enjoyed this weeks episode of my news in Ecuador.  The Lord bless each and every one of you.            Luis - Soli Deo Gloria -  Praise Points: - Thank God that Camp was a true blessing to all there and we all could leave camp refreshed in our souls - Thank God I could meet up with the other missionaries especially those near Cuenca (Saraguro and Yangtzaza) - God is Holy, yet merciful.  We have really seen again  the holiness of God and how people responded to it.  Prayer Points: - Spanish classes as we get back into them for the long haul please pray that I can apply myself and really take in the spanish and use it. - Peace of heart as I think about the issues ahead, missing home and if this is really where God wants me - Men and women of peace in Cuenca that I may be welcomed there and have a fruitful ministry in the Lord there
