      Sports in Baltimore one could argue is the best in the country.  After attending the Yankee game this week with 44 of our good friends one would be convinced Baltimore has done it stadiums right. From the Inner Harbor to the stadium itself. Hotels, restaurants, bars, parking.  We have attended sporting events in many cities across the country and although we have fun poking at Baltimore it is alot more fun to go to a Ravens game then a Redskins game. The owner is cooler also.  Even my favorite Yankee Stadium can not compare to the experience of Camden Yards. The Inner Harbor has something over the Bronx. Not quite sure what exactly....is this heresey?  Game 6 against the Braves is like nothing I ever experienced, but I would of rather of went to Pickles to celebrate then run for our lives to Manhattan. Although Wanda meeting Gary Maddux and half of the Brave team in the hotel bar at 5 am after they lost is a story in itself.  Coors Field in Colorado and Wrigley in Chicago both came to mind but all we did was include more then Baseball and Baltimore comes out on top. More bus trips and more fun to come! Stay tuned

      your choice really how much do you want to spend? for less then $400 per person total you could go to the bahamas for three nights and airfare from BWI or Richmond. i will spare you the details but the trip is awesome. Freeport, Grand Bahama Island. Lots of options on where to stay. For the 400 the Bahamian is beatiful.  Ask any of our staff they have all been there at least once.  Spend a little more and stay over at Lacaya which has like seven different hotels. Breakers Cay is the nicest. Ocean front.  1(800)545-1300 Grand Bahama Vacations  but if you really want to stay in the nicest hotel in the world over the last four years hands down.... Atlantis on Paradise Island. you fly into nassau so it more expensive right there although USAir has a direct flight from Reagan (2 hour trip) you must stay in the royal towers to experience it to the fullest which adds mucho dollars to the cost. but you never know who you will see there. the uber rich stay at the ocean club (a golf cart takes you to the atlantis) very quiet and expensive..not for us www.atlantis.com  we have a pool and a pond.....the pond be good for you  living on the east coast makes the bahamas possible for a weekend just a thought i'd share with you all hoefully we will see you soon

      the reason Zig's is online in the blog world is because of a man named Seth Godin. If you already know who he is, that means you read Fast Company magazine. I have discovered that magazine is the connecting point of a very large and influential hive. oops...i am getting ahead of myself here. you dont know what i mean by hive so.... Seth sold his company to Yahoo in the beginning for a zillion dollars and proceeded to write books. He is also an editor of Fast Company. His article is inside the back cover every issue if you are in business for a living (not a hobby, how alot of peole treat it) you need to know this man's ideas His books are available at our website www.zigsbar.com or Amazon The titles of his top five are: Purple Cow Unleashing the Idea Virus Big Red Fez Permission Marketing and the latest release is Free Prize Inside  these are all required reading for our staff Heather and i took a trip to his loft north of the city (ny) to spend a day with him. to succeed in this world today new ideas are needed. we would highly recommend his seminar. well worth it. www.sethgodin.com  check out the details and check out his blog His ideas keep us moving forward Zig's would like to Thank Seth for his ideas and more specifically for his hospitality he showed us on our visit to his world.

      Looking back hundreds of years, with hindsight to our advantage, where would you choose to live?  If we were alive during the Greek civilization, where would we of wanted to live?  More then likely rather then being in a conqueror country we would choose to live in or nearby Athens. Perhaps a beautiful ranch three hours ride on your horse from the city. When Italy was controlling the Roman Empire, would we choose to live near Rome? It seems with hindsight there is a draw to live near the center of power. I realize with information flowing at the speed of light it downplays this issue, but all one has to do is read a newspaper from Denver to see some things take longer to change.  So using this newfound insight fast forward 500 hundred years and look back to this day and age. The center of the world would be on the East Coast of the United States - New York/Washington  Perhaps that is what keeps all of us living and loving this area. Although many talk of fonder places they choose to continue to live here. Economy is usually the best at the center, the actual change of seasons ( 4 different seasons)&nbsp;is a draw that many do not realize until they move to Florida, being in the know has a subconscious draw to us. Local news to us is what the President did today. We take a lot for granted and perhaps we should take a moment to appreciate this wonderful life we have in America.  Now the dark clouds roll in called terrorism. If the crazies are going to detonate a nuclear device it will be in New York or Washington for these same reasons. As the center of the world it is also the center of the target. We must all prepare for the day because it is no longer a matter of if but when.  There is some serious hatred out there. So while we have it so well APPRECIATE it!

      Ocean City Maryland is an unlikely place to find one of the greatest bars in the world but that is exactly what you get with Seacrets  One can listen to live reggae in the sand all night long (with a keno bar just off to the side)  or perhaps you want to go to the night club with the bouncing steel floor, balloons and confetti from the ceiliing and just a dance hall gone crazy. Non stop dancing all....night.....long  The ad on the radio says ADD is good at Seacrets, if you get bored in one place just move to another.  Food until 1 am, 100 security and&nbsp;100 servers/bartenders seem like an army every night. The jerk chicken is great, although&nbsp;I should try it sober sometime to really be sure. Dining in the bay floating on a raft while the sun is up is a sight to see&nbsp;(hardbodies only) For us normal folks they have rows of booths along the beach.  Over 10,000 people pay $10 a head every saturday there.  You must like crowds, North Carolina this is not.  That will be the subject of another message soon  &nbsp;  1982- seacrets is just that a seacret. Close down the Ocean Club at 2am, walk across costal highway, down a dirt road to an old gas station,&nbsp;friends hung out&nbsp;until morning.  Eventually it become&nbsp; a private club, then a public one and now perhaps the best bar on the planet.  I was at studio 54 at its peak, LA bars owned by famous people, Tiki bars in tropical paradises,  just recently the VIP room at the Ghost Bar at the Palms and I will stick my neck out and say none compare to a night in Seacrets. Find&nbsp;it and get Lost!  &nbsp;  If you are in Ocean City and are looking for any of the Zigs staff, you can find us at Seacrets by midnight, usually listening to live reaggae and playing keno.  Seacrets, Jamica USA&nbsp;  &nbsp;
