      Seeing SJP in the new fabulous GAP ads makes me long for the days of SATC. It was a show that made me seriously contemplate whether I should stay single during my 20's and move to New York to pursue fashion and writing...but alas...the show was ideal, and mostly a fantasy world where the characters had time to get together for cosmos on a daily basis.    This ad also makes me want to customize my jeans the way SJP did, by adding ribbons and piping and cutting the jeans to different lengths. I don't usually like GAP clothing because it's so plain and boring--but Sarah's new ads are creative and fun, and they give me all types of ideas.

      Richard Brautigan-- a poet who I respect and enjoy, wrote a poem that infuriated me. It's called  The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster .  Every time you take your pill, it's like a mine disaster.  I think of all the people lost inside you.  My Reply is called  Masterbation Versus the Swiss Air Crash   Every time you jack off, it's like a plane crash. I think of all the people splattered on the floor.  It's the poem I'm most proud of. :)

      I'm 23 and I've never known anyone, besides aquaintences, who has died. I've never even faced the death of a pet--they all either ran away or were given away. I could feel that I'm lucky, but instead I feel the opposite. Since I have never had to confront death, somehow it doesn't exist to me. When I actually stop and think about the concept, it scares me so much that I can't seem to function. People can talk about death all they want, but it's not the same until you experience it with someone you love. That's why I know that when it happens to me, I might not be able to handle it. If I had been forced to face it at an earlier age, I think I might be more prepared. It's very unnatural; I know that death happens to other people, but it hasn't  happened  yet to me. And every year I have this impending sense of doom that gets bigger and bigger, because I know that things won't be this way forever. And the thought that runs through my mind is  how many days do I have left until something bad happens ? I'm not religious, but thank God it didn't happen while my brother was in Iraq. I guess this is what my birthday evokes, the sense that another year has passed, and things are great, but they can't be forever. I guess I should turn to the poets.   AFRAID? Of whom am I afraid?   Not death; for who is he?   The porter of my father’s lodge   As much abasheth me.       Of life? ‘T were odd I fear a thing          That comprehendeth me   In one or more existences   At Deity’s decree.       Of resurrection? Is the east   Afraid to trust the morn          With her fastidious forehead?   As soon impeach my crown!            ---Emily Dickinson

      I have chosen a fairy that I want to be my next tattoo, but I'm not sure. Getting a fairy on the lower back is so common, and this particular fairy is by Amy Brown, the artist that hundreds of girls have used for their fairy tattoos. I don't know if something this permanent should be more unique. My first tattoo was based on an artist, but not one that many people know about. I'm getting cold feet! But I really do like this image. I guess I should be completely sure about it first--there's no going back once I say yes. Maybe that's why I like getting tattoos so much--it's a defiant act that says: I have the power to redesign myself  permanently .

         It's part existential foreign film (Run Lola Run), part B-rated horror film (Army of Darkness)--with a splash of government anti-pop culture propaganda! This is by far one of the strangest films I have ever seen. I can't decide if it's brilliant or painfully ridiculous. Either way, I would highly recommend it.

      Movie Quote of the Day: Am I going mad--or did the word THINK escape your lips?!  Finally--an outlet for my neurotic mind. Thanks to Maju for the introduction to the voyeuristic world of blogs. It curbs the writer's craving AND reveals the secrets of others. Fabulous.
