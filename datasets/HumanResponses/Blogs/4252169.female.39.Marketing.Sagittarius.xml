           I looked back on my past       I remembered the years i cried       The jokes i laughed at       The things that i missed and lost       But one thing that i'll never forget       The day you became my friend              All the time I've spent with you       Puts a smile upon my face       I hope one day I'll be with you again       Somehow, sometimes, someplace....              A friend will come and a friend will go       The season will change and time will show       But one thing that will never gonna change       The spirit of friendship!       And still I hope that you'll be there for me       And I'll be there for you       Sometime... someplace my friend!

         ... nice comment bebe! thank you for taking a look at my work... well what can i say..? lets enjoy life with a lie! if thats the way to enjoy then lets do it! hahaha! but not overdoing it coz it wont be fun anymore.... i think thats why there is such a word as white lie... a lie not to hurt someone... a lie with a good intention... that makes sense is it...?

         for today, since i left the house late because i got crazy over this page, i did a little work but i was a good samaritan to a new med rep in the territory who happens to be a former officemate. He is new to the job so i gave him tips and oriented him in the territory... showing him the different clinics and hospitals as well as fixing his masterlist...extending help to anyone is always a pleasure for me... And most of all, the problem i got yesterday with my sister is okay now.She texted me and reassured me that she talked to mom already and everythings fine. God heard my prayers.....
