      I have revamped the look of the site. Now it's looking better, in my opinion. I am in the process of auditing the rest of the site to see if anything else needs to be changed.

      As it turns out, Tiger preview would not install on either my PowerBook or PowerMac. As soon as the machines booted from the install DVD, a massive kernel panic occurred, rendering the entire process unsalvagable. I guess those promised Tiger screenshots and reviews will not be coming as planned. What a bummer. Also, I intended to post pictures of my new iPod, but the pictures came out looking absolutely fantastically shitty. I will take some more sometime later and post them.

      This just in, courtesy of Mr. Phil Bertrand:  At Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a set square, a slide rule, and a calculator. At a morning press conference, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.  "Al-gebra is a fearsome cult," Ashcroft said. "They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and '!  y'  and refer to themselves as 'unknowns', but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'there are 3 sides to every triangle'.  When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, "If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes."

      Finally, Apple has introduced the 4th generation iPod. I have opined before on what Apple should do to improve the little wonder, and for the most part, my prayers have been answered.  I have mentioned that iPod must significantly increase its battery life. Eight hours is not enough, and I said I would prefer 16 hours on a single charge. Well, the new iPod has a 12 hour battery life, some four hours less than my preference, but it is good enough nonetheless. Also, a major feature I wished for was the click-wheel, as found on iPod Minis. Apple apparently thought it was a good idea as well and had integrated this control interface into the new iPod. Now with the click wheel, I am able to operate iPod in my pocket without looking at the unit. Also, the click-wheel provides physical feedback on actions performed, and this is always nicer than having to fiddle with non-mechanical touch sensitive buttons that are naturally deficient at communicating with the user.   The new iPod is slightly smaller than its older siblings. Although the reduction in dimensions and weight is somewhat negligible, it is nevertheless a welcome touch. All things electronics have a tendency to shrink in size as time goes on, and iPod is no exception here. The fit and finish on the unit is top-notch, as one would expect from Apple. The unit is small and light. Yet, it feels solid and sturdy in my hand. The new iPod retains the same prepheral connectors as the previous generation. The dock and firewire connectors are the same as before.  The click-wheel is a wonderful thing indeed. The texture of wheel is slightly sandy, but it is smooth enough to easily glide your finger over it effortlessly. Pressing the wheel gives you a solid click, and the sound it makes is similar to trackpad buttons on laptops.  Also, this is just a minor point: ever since the inception of iPod, the advertisement posters have always depicted iPods as having a blue backlit display light. However, of the 3 iPods I had owned up to this point, the backlight was always white. A minor discrepency to be sure, but I had always subconsciously wanted the light to be blue. Now, that wish had been granted. The new iPod now indeed has the blue backlight, and damn, it looks great. The iPod menu has been streamedlined and re-arranged to better fit the listening habits of its users. The main menu now only contains "Music", "Settings", "Extras", "Shuffle Songs", and "Backlight". Categories such as artists, playlists, songs, composers, etc., have been subsumed under the "Music" menu item. The placement of "Shuffle" at the top level of the menu was based on the fact that many iPod users prefer to play songs from their collections randomly. Instead of having to dig through three layers of menus to find shuffle, users now can access the feature immediately. As before, menu can be customized. Also, you now can create multiple on-the-go playlists. This is handy if you want to subdivide the songs you want to listen to into categories, such as having an on-the-go playlist for your favorite Classical tunes and another one for Rock songs. I will post some pictures of the iPod and its packaging in my gallery sometime tomorrow.

      Niiiice!  My Airport Express wireless router has arrived. The packaging is signature Apple style, and the unit itself is tiny. Airtunes worked flawlessly. You can actually plug a pair of regular earbuds into the audio port and have it recognized by iTunes. I will take some pictures of it and post it later on the gallery page (gallery page has yet to be created, but I should have it up in no time).   Also, I have gotten a hold of Tiger, Apple's next iteration of its operating system. I will try to install it on one of my machines and post some comments on it along with some screenshots.

      This just in:     The Republican National Committee announced today that the Republican Party is changing its emblem from an elephant to a condom. Governor Marc Racicot, RNC chairman, explained that the condom more clearly reflects the party's stance today, because a condom accepts inflation, halts production, destroys the next generation, protects pricks, and gives you a sense of security while you're actually getting screwed.

      Bush to monkey = baboon to monkey...  (Monkey = Bush) = the ultimate compliment for Bush. Bush to shit = cow manure to gold. Bush to intelligence = fantasy to reality. Bush to integrity = the mob mentality to rationality. Bush to responsibility = infection to anti-biotic. Bush to cocaine = fish to water. Bush to America = herbicide to plants.  Bush to proper English = unprotected sex to condoms.  Do you know Bush is the missing link between humanity and baboons? I mean, Bush does have baboon-like eyes, doesn't he? They are so closely grouped together, just like baboons.   Bush's favorite words, which are fictitious, include "misunderestimate", "subliminanable", "nukler", etc.  On the subject of his questionable use of English language, Bush best sums it in his own words, "in My Sentences I Go Where No Man Has Gone Before."

          Locke is correct in positing that a blind man made to see would not be able to, using his newly endowed sight, distinguish figures that are otherwise easily distinguishable by his touch.  For the blind man, the concepts of a sphere and cube exist in his mind insofar that they give different sensations through his faculty of touch.  To judge which object is a cube and which a sphere, with sight alone, the person would be unable to tackle the task, precisely because he had no prior sight experience upon which the judgment can be based.  For a person with normal sensory capacities, a cube or sphere is known through multiple sensory channels. He would sense a cube, through sight, as having six square sides; he would also know the cube through touch, as the edges and corners where the sides meet give more acute pressure when touched.  All the information gotten through different senses become associated and then integrated into a complete sensory construction of a cube.  In the Molineaux problem, the blind person does not have a complete sensory construction of a cube or objects in general, since he lacks sensory information produced by sight.  To distinguish a cube from a sphere solely through sight would be impossible because: one, he could not correlate the ideas known through touch with the ideas known through sight, because they are radically different ideas, and they represent very different kinds of sensations and qualities; and two, insofar a cube and sphere appear to his eyes, he sees them without judgment; that is he merely sees without classifying and categorizing them.  He is unable to apply labels such as “cube” and “sphere” to what he sees because he does not yet know the attributes of cubes and spheres as sensed by sight. In other words, he may visually differentiate a cube from a sphere, insofar that they look different and appear distinct, but he would not be able to tell which is the cube and which is the sphere.

      The best cure for the unbearable affliction of guilt is to absolve one of any sense of responsibility.  By taking away social constructs such as obligation and duty, one becomes detached from the consequences of his or her actions.  Therefore, regardless of the effects brought about by these consequences, whether they be beneficial or harmful, one can neither be held culpable for the injury caused or lay claim to the glory of the good deeds done.

      	A summer of fun for me?  Buh!  I am a superhero, and I cannot afford fun.  My busy schedule dictates that I dedicate myself to saving humanity from the brink of destruction.  My evil nemeses spare no effort in attempting to subvert justice and decency, so I, for as long as I have an ounce of strength left in me, will diligently protect your freedom and you hapless humans from subjugation.  Admit it, you need me as a crutch so you can go about your daily routines in peace.  So, again, the answer is no!  I have no time for fun.  I must keep my watchful eyes on the forces of evil, and I must always be on high alert to spoil their sinister plans, and I have no time for pleasantries.  So, please do think of me and thank me before going to bed every evening for I am the reason you are able to sleep safely at night.  What's that? NO!  I don't want medals and honors, and no, I will not accept your candies and sweets.  I am diabetic, are you trying to kill me,  stupid?!

      As the army of angels, led by Gabriel, champion and the right hand of God, brought forth their furor and unleashed their terrible might upon the minions of Lucifer, the Devil was dealt a resounding defeat; but alas, although the battle was won by the Holy Spirit, He had lost the war to the Dark Prince, for Lucifer had long ago succeeded in corrupting the innocence of humanity and sewn the seeds of rebelliousness, self-indulgence, and vanity, qualities that have since become the hallmarks of men.  Hence, it was God who created men, but it was the Devil who defined their nature, molded their essence, and eventually came to the possession of their souls.  Although Jesus have subsequently re-transmitted God's message to men, a message that had previously been lost amidst the constant whisperings of the Devil, but Christ, along with the will of God, were to be thwarted yet again by the guile of Lucifer: for Christ had but a short stay among men, but the Devil persisted long after His departure and promptly resumed his machination.  It is evident that the passage of time has all but undone the penance of Christ performed through His grisly crucifixion, as the memory of the Holy Son, along with His message and His fabled deeds, faded into obscurity and a fleeing blur in the memory of men.  It was Lucifer, the Prince of the Dark, who triumphed and claimed victory over God in the war to vie for the hearts of men, and it was the Devil's whims that dominated men's history and dictated their deeds.

      I recall that a certain friend of my who journeyed to Africa to see the elephants but never returned.  Years later, they found him, dead of course, but his body was quite remarkably preserved. Although a bit dry, but nevertheless it was looking pretty well as far as dead bodies go.  If I am not mistaken, he even had a slight smile on his face, as if he died content and satisfied.  Then again, it could just be me misinterpreting his deformed face, which was wrecked by wrinkles, cracks, and variously other marks, courtesy of the unforgiving African climate.

      The 12 signs of a spineless crybaby loser:   12) You have no problems flirting with 16 year-olds... when you are 25.   11) You cry and sob incessantly and feel crushed after your "girlfriend" of only two weeks decides that you are a clingy and needy loser and dumps you.  10) Every time you get dumped by a girl, you take it as a sign to pursue the girl even harder.  9) Your favorite past time is stalking women in public places and trying to pick up a mate.  8) You always get dumped, always.  7) You have a chubby and bald brother who is a creep toward women.  6) You think telling people what you have done today in painstaking details is a good conversation.  5) You think you had fun last night on a date, but the date thinks you bored her to the verge of insanity.   4) As soon as a girl smiles at you, you think you have found your true love.  When she does not reciprocate with the same passion, you feel crushed and ready to die.  3) You are still trying to get back to your old "girlfriends" who dumped you half a decade ago.  2) When you talk to a lady, you never fail to bring up your ex-girlfriends.  In fact, you think it's cool to parade your stupid love life in a conversation.   1) You stick your man-boobs out while pulling down your shirt when you talk to people.   The above 12 statements accurately portrays an erstwhile friend of mine.

          Your beauty within is rarely discovered without a friend who is willing to go to the depth to find it. Moreover, it will never be known to the public if no one is willing to advertise it on your behalf.  The legends of sages and saints are much the same in this regard, for they are tales demonstrating their inner strength and piety, tales that have been passed down through history and have become treasures of our collective memory; but they are just old advertisements, to be sure. There have been many more pious men who remained obscure because their piety was never made known to others.      For any opinion, no matter how trivial and value-neural, there are inevitably many who regard it as offensive.      There will always be more people who prefer opining or speculating over putting their ideas to actual tests. In many ways, this is a good thing.  Since most ideas and beliefs are neither valid nor practical, it is best that they are mostly entertained rather than realized.      When the conceptually abstract entangles you in the dizzying maze of confusion, wrangle free by embracing reality.      No idea is thoroughly original.  Therefore, the secret to true genius lies with copying ideas and convincing others that you are the sole proprietor.      Simple ideas can be difficult to grasp if they are novel to those who try to understand them.

          The fundamental organizing principle of any society is to gear for war, or so say the realists. I am inclined to believe that the driving force behind any society is to procreate and reproduce because you can't have a society when you don't replenish the population pool. In that sense, we are not so different from rabbits.      Wild animals are the most dangerous when they are hungry.  The same goes for humans as well, except that humans crave more than just food.  They hunger for fame, vanity, money, respect, power, etc.  This is precisely why human beings are infinitely more dangerous than wild animals.      Evolution is not linear. This is a point often missed by many who are suspicious of natural sciences in general. Being evolved does not mean being better.  It only means being different.  Evolution is, in a nutshell, biological adaptations through mutation across generations.  This process is above human value judgments, standards, and preferences.  What we like is not always looked upon favorably by Mother Nature, and Mother Nature often decides what is the best for us over our objections.

         I cannot wait for the next generation iPods to come out. I personally have owned one from each revision. It has been nothing but pleasure for me, and it has truly transformed my music-listening habits.     However, I am a very picky person, and with that in mind, I believe the next crop of iPods must possess two qualities/features in order to fully stay ahead of the game:    1) Longer Battery Life: Need I say more? Eight hour batter life is not nearly long enough for me. One of the drawbacks with the current generation of iPods is that they require more frequent recharge. Mine runs out of juice about every seven hours or so. Apple really needs to pack a lot more juice into the batteries. The competitors have introduced hard drive based players (that are comparable in size) which can run up to 24 hours on a single charge. I am not asking too much here, and I don't want a 30-hour battery; I just need it to last at least 16 hours.     2) Click-Wheel: I know Apple probably has already done this, but until the new iPods are unveiled, I will mention this nonetheless. I believe the click-wheel on iPod Minis are far superior to the interface found on their bigger brothers. The regular sized iPods have taken a step backward in usability compared to their predecessors. I dearly miss the olden days when I used to be able to operate my iPod without looking at them because the buttons are located differently and can be distinguished easily by touch. I used to reach in my pocket and operate the little wonder with ease. This is not so with the latest iPods. The fast forward/rewind/menu/play buttons on these new iPods are all closely packed together in a row. I can no longer tell the differences unless I take out the unit and look at the button labels.  Furthermore, these buttons do not respond consistently. Sometimes they are overly sensitive, activating accidentally; whereas other times, they are  not sensitive enough, and no matter the amount of pressing/tapping, they inexplicably fail to respond.     If Apple can improve the iPod in these two areas, then it will be able to, in my humble opinion, truly widen the lead over its competitors.    Feel free to tell me what you think and what you want in the next generation iPods ;)

      I stumbled upon a recording of Bill O'Rilley's (of the O'Rilley's Factor fame)  urlLink interview  of Mr. Glick.  Mr. Glick lost his father on 9/11, and he had opposed U.S. war on Afghanistan.  Mr. O'Rilley invited Mr. Glick to his show to inquire as to why a person who lost his father on 9/11 would oppose the U.S. war on Afghanistan.  Regardless of Mr. Glick's reasoning for his position, Mr. O'Rilley's manner with which he conducted his interview is a disgrace, and I am ashamed of him for his lack of sensitivity and respect, regardless of the personal differences on geo-politics and ideology between him and Mr. Glick.  Mr. Glick cited facts during the interview to support his reasoning, and I supposed facts are only as good as the interpretations, but Mr. O'Rilley did not even bother to show his often advertised respect for facts; instead, he denigrated the cited facts as "crap" and declared that he did not want to hear them.  This is hardly acceptable, in my humble opinion, considering Mr. O'Rilley has consistently distinguished his show from others as being the most objective and straight to the point.  Being straight-talking does not entail, the last I checked, barking at the guest and treating him without proper respect and demanding him to "shut up".  Mr. O'Rilley's manner is the least professional I have seen, and his utter disregard for those who disagree with him is shockingly apparent.  To those who watch his show and wish to defend him, I am hard pressed to put myself in your shoes and honestly say that Mr. O'Rilley was understandable in his actions that transpired during the interview.  I would like to hear what you think of the interview.   To view the video of the interview, please  urlLink  click here .

      Oh yeah, life is good. I'm sitting here listening to the soothing melodies of  urlLink Zero 7 , sipping on iced coffee, working on my website, and the weather outside is beautiful.  The temperature is ideal and breezes are abundant.  The sun is setting, casting a bright orange veneer over all things earth-bound.  It is especially preferential toward those chrome-rich Harleys parked outside, transforming those machines into gleaming wonders of art.  I have settled quite comfortably into my own little corner at the coffee house.  After a grueling day of grunt work, this kind of relaxation hits the spot. As the caffeine slowly seeps into my system, I am becoming gradually alert and tuned into my surroundings. I am feeling just fabulous. My mind is clear and my mood pleasant. However, as with all things wonderful, my bliss will come to an end soon.  As the sun continues its downward trajectory, the brilliant glow will no doubt fade away.  My caffeine induced ecstasy is also quickly evaporating into renewed weariness.  Another day ends... in much the same way.
