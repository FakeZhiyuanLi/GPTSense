      As sadistic as it may sound when engaged in a verbal battle your enemies insecurities will be your ammunition. Calling someone a 'dipshit' or some other "insult" (as I've said before) just dosn't cut it against a good opponent, it bounces right off. Unless they are already worried about being a dipshit, I don't even know what a dip shit is exactly so I'm not sure how I could be insecure about it. Anyway, you need to bait someone into giving it away because once you've got one you can rip them to shreds.  In order to find one of these your will often have to sink to the lowest common denominator: curse words, and sexual preference based flaming and so fourth etc etc. Although the former rarely works, if your up against anyone under the age of 18 the latter often does.  There are several weak spots in a person that can be exploited:  Family:  family is always the closest to a person's heart and so, if you can find a flaw or that they have an especially deep attachment you can often exploit it.  Sexual Preference:  Often this dosn't work seeing as there is (generally) only three: gay, straight and bi. Now this is by far the best to use if you live in a homophobic community (as I do) even if you yourself (and I hope you are not) a homophobe. Someone who has any incling that they may not be straight and surrounded by homophobes that'll beat the crap out of them for that fact will lead them to acts of great vengeance in order to retain their hetrosexual honor.  Curse Words:  you know what they are, if the bible disproves of them they're in. Some people (not the smart ones) will find these very, very insulting as they are the words their simple minds take in as insulting. If a curse word affects them by all means use it, as long as they act accordingly you won't look any less the fool.  Parents:  Big no no. If you dare prey on a passed parent may your soul burn in hell for all eternity etc etc. Mum jokes suck and dad jokes (although (I'll assume) less foul in a femal's case) are just plain wrong. so don't even bother, it's pathetic. Obviously the fact I made a subtitle for parents they do not come under family.  Sexual Organs:  Yep so many people are insecure in this department it's not funny and it's my advice you try this one first, it'll give you a head start and almost always pays off.  Reading your enemy's repsonse is the most important part of the exploitation of insecurities. You may as well have a crack at clobbering him/her with a stick if your innept at this. Ok then well I'm not going to belittle you by giving you some baiting lines you'll have to figure those out for yourself. But generally speaking the responses will go as follows.  Reply is:   Calm, well thoughtout:  You suck and it didn't work they couldn't care less about it.  Agitated but still well thougt out:  Bring it up a couple of times more (not straight away) to see if they respond more harshly. Be warned that if it dosn't work the potential for looking like an ass is high.  Angry, yet still thought out:  You can usually tell if someone is angry they'll pause, narrows their eyes and respond. Chances are bringing it up again will set them off, but the same applies as above, be cautious.  Laughing loudly:  Listen to people laugh, you will be able to, over time, figure out when a person is pretending to laugh. Generally speaking if you can pick a fake laugh you've nailed em although they are smart. Mocking you rather then abbusing CAN be a good cover up and can easilt disguise hert feelings.  Abbuse:  They are most likely dumb and I'd advise using a curse word in response something nasty.  Angered Abbuse:  You've nailed it, not only has it pissed them off but you've found that your enemy also lacks a very important commodity: composure. Go for it and nail them with curse words intertwined with which ever insecurity you have uncovered.  I know one person who is immensly insecure: He is from hillbilly stock, both his parents dropped out at yr10 and his brothers and sisters, from what I'v heard don't have two brain cells to rub together. He is blatantly homosexual and constantly talks about the masculine genitals and homosexuals. Because of his hillbilyl stock he is about as well supported as a kitten on crack and has developed an immense insecurity involving sexual preference.  A guy at school, when he(the hick) was rambling on about something involving his genitals, said to me "he must have a 3 inch dick". He eventually found out what he said and flipped, he covered just about every response I listed about bar the first. He went through them almost in that exact order, even resorting to physical abuse (he slapped me which is ironic).  Very few are an as big a gold mine of insulting oppertunities as the guy I spoke about above but everyone has their minor insecurities. If the very few (relatively) I've told you don't work; be creative. Hell even try your own insecurities on him, they will very rarely, if ever turn them around.  Later I hope to explain how to protect your own insecurities, it'll be done when Ic an actually figure out a good method of doing it. It's far harder then you'd think.

      Over the last few weeks I've made a startling discovery. You guessed it, logic. Good logic is complete and utterly unbeatable and the only way an enemy can respond is either by submitting or making an ass of his/her self.  Example. Today, during class, one of the chaps looked at me as he crossed my vision, I quickly replied in an amusing sarcastic tone "what are yooooooou lookin' at?" he then said "someone that is not me". I thought for a moment and realized, other then insulting his comeback there was really nothing I could do about it. It wasn't insulting so lashing out would make me look like a fool and yet because of the blatant logic, my sharp wit could not have been brought to bear.  Good logic is the logic I'm talking about here, bad logic is useless and will get you in deeper than you can handle. Illogical people are generally unstable and instability leads to emotion and in the art of verbal sparring emotion cannot play a part. When emmotion comes into it mum(mom) jokes float to the surface and, unless your opponent has down syndrome, you'll have lost the battle. Considering emotion generally speaking lies in good and bad and when you're being insulted (no matter how well you take it) the emotion you'll feel will be either pushing you to shallow laughter or pain and sadness.  Against a level headed person "you're gay" just doesn't cut it as an insult. Seeing as often enough you won't know much about their sexual preference and in the unlikely case you are up against a homosexual, they've made that choice and it is about as insulting as calling you straight. (assuming you are in fact straight).  Logic requires ground and if you're up against someone you've never met you're going to need some meat to feed on. Using words to gather this information will be covered in a later article.
