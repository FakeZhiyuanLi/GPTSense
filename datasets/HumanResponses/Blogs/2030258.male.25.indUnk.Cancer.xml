      Cleared one presentation. Two more essays and one project to go. Steady now. Gonna remain focused.   It never fails to amaze me how the human spirit has a certain strength within it to find hope in the worst of all situations. Call it our greatest evil or our greatest foolishness but it does give humanity a certain aura of glory. Of course apart from the hope there's always the element of how we manage to recover and regenerate from countless hurts and issues that threaten to plague us for the rest of our existence. I have always remembered the ending of Dickens'  Great Expectations ... How the mists rose at the end of the novel and Pip moves on to a new ambiguous phase of his life. There are many ways to read that but for me, within the ambiguity lies a certain promise of growth and a happier future. The ambiguity also questions our very own beliefs about the human spirit's capacity to restore itself!!!  On a more mundane note, I was very much flattered today when a fellow traveller suggested that I dressed up as a Dr B. I mean how could I not be flattered to be compared to the legendary Dr B?! He is the best lecturer... Conducts interesting and interactive seminars, is matured and sexy, has a humble countenance, and most of all, never ever fails to return our assignments back to us at such early dates that we are eternally grateful to him!!! And guess what? Another traveller actually said I should have NO DIFFICULTY pulling it off as DR B!!! I am swooning with so much pride at such comments that I can no longer type...

      It's been a cool rainy day... Feeling at peace at myself and the stress from deadlines seem to be far far away. The words of Blue Bayou keep on playing in my head...  I feel so bad I’ve got a worried mind I’m so lonesome all the time Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou  Saving nickels, saving dimes, working ’till the sun don’t shine Looking forward to happier times on blue bayou I’m going back some day come what may to blue bayou Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on blue bayou  All those fishing boats with their sails afloat if I could only see That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I’d be  Go to see my baby again And to be with some of my friends Maybe I’d be happy then on blue bayou  I’m going back some day, gonna stay on blue bayou Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on blue bayou Oh, that girl of mine by my side the silver moon and the evening tide Oh, some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin’ inside I’ll never be blue, my dreams come true on blue bayou

      Yes as Len says, if only life was simpler. If only we could all just behave in accordance to our instincts, to feed and to survive. Perhaps life is simple. Perhaps in comparison to what we are, life is like a pea in the ocean. Perhaps we make our lives as complex as we can bear so as to forget all about the complexities within us. We torture our minds with the various interpretations and constructions of meanings in order to forget about the raging tempest of uncertainty within ourselves.   Sometimes at night, I hear a wail deep inside of me... A certain dark beast calls out to be freed. To be freed from all the social and moral constraints that this world has hammered in. Pounded in. Drilled, twisted and gored in. There is a rage, a lust to taste the blood of another life. An urge to feel raw flesh in the mouth. The tough yet juicy texture of meat and veins, yielding more blood with each bite. Only then may I sleep. For now, to sleep in content.

      Another lazy day. I feel lame that I even am bothered with an entry now but well...   Through exploring Shadowness.com, I stumbled upon another digital art site that has incredible pictures of scenery... The likes of which resembles our own but yet is a fragment of the author's imagination! If only I could do stuff like that! Yes, it has always been my obsession to create a world of my own. To have in it the things that I find beautiful and terrible at the same time...   Now that I think about it, my obsession goes way back to my younger days when I spent a hell lot of time playing AD&D with Jon, Mok and Cow. Jon and I were especially fond of throwing other players into our own worlds. The difference between Jon and I was that he always seemed to put more effort into the creation process, carefully drawing maps and recording down information. On the other hand, I basically spent time dreaming of the world on my way home... and when it came to penning down what I dreamt of, I would realise that I had forgotten everything!  Well, I do miss those good old days of innocence in the process of corruption... Now we've all grown up, grown a little busier and have less time for dreams. Sigh. I guess I have to be thankful for those times nonetheless.

      So little time so much to do. Yet my ass remains stuck to the seat, the floor and the bed. Sheesh...  It has been a lazy day and the weather strangely reflects it too. Repaired my broken guitar string and tried out the new pick. Everything sounds great once again. They say music is life. Bullshit. Music is blood that courses through your veins. Speaking of which, I suddenly remembered an old song by Brian Eno and Elvis Costello entitled  My Dark Life . It's simply beautiful. The words and music work like a spell that shadows the listener in the song's darkness... And you know how the darkness is...

      After taking a long, slow break I am back at the table with more work to do. Guess I'll just have to prepare for the rough road ahead again. I have spent a great deal of gold during my mini-holiday and shall have to tighten my purse strings. Gold does not come easy these days... and I cannot live complacently on just the small amount that I have managed to hoard up over the centuries.  Watched Matchstick Men but can't really comment on it. It's good entertainment but nothing more I guess... or at least not enough to make me have an opinion about it and to write about it.  We all make choices in life. Some good, some bad. I have been trying to walk in the day, under the shade of the trees. But then suddenly I realise that the shade no longer provides any comfort - it reminds me of hiding from a light that I have long forgotton, and the fact that I need to hide fills me with disgust and defiance at the same time... Why do I seek comfort from the shade when the night gives me so much more... joy, pleasure, ecstasy... The warmth of the day burns you up but the cold of the night soothes and gives off a slight murmur of warmth when you slowly sink into it...  It's all about the duality of things... and how you chose to make the best mix of it. Happy is the alchemist who extracts the sweetness of each component as he imbibes his potion. Well I'll just stick to blood for now.

       Why is an essay an ass-say?  Well basically, if your ass could speak, whatever it has to say would be definitely a) full of shit and b) nothing but air. Right now, a third scenario applies for me - c) in order to force ideas out, the ass has been ripped open and it is now literally being a pain-in-the-ass.  As promised, I shall deliver something slightly less morbid than what I have been used to writing... So I do hope that travellers who stumble upon this oasis will find beauty in the words below... (well at least in the first stanza...)  [Addicted]  by The Wanderer   The light of new dawn breaking The smell of salt in breeze The sound of raindrops falling The taste of melted cheese  The poisons I breathe deep in The crap that we eat each day Putrid thoughts that swell within Useless words we try to say  The list goes on forever Of pleasures plain and pure They fill me with such fervour This addiction has no cure  Then the darkness refreshes Tearing away at the skin Blood that gives life to ashes The beast that rages within

      I ache. The muscles that support the left portion of my spine groan with each effort that I make in getting up or twisting around. Yet I comfort myself that muscle aches are commonly attributed to that particular muscle in the progress of growing bigger... Mmm... If my back muscles do grow bigger then perhaps I shall begin to call myself the Hunchback of Serangoon instead. People have commented on the seeming bleakness of this journal and perhaps I shall have to add something beautiful to chase away its apparent gloom. Check back soon...

       Simple Plan - No Helmets, No Pads... Just Balls : Do not underestimate them. These fellas are far from simple. They are not exactly punk... more towards the alternative rock side. Many good tracks within this album like 'I'd Do Anything', 'I'm Just A Kid', 'Addicted', 'When I'm With You'... My personal favourite is 'Perfect'; it sounds great and the lyrics are deeply meaningful. Check out the chorus:  'Cuz we lost it all  Nothing lasts forever I'm sorry  I can't be perfect Now it's just too late and  We can't go back I'm sorry  I can't be perfect

      I have five scrolls to read before my meeting with Dr Richardson so I figured that I shall write in my journal before I set about that arduous task. Today I made a trip to the marketplace and learned a hell lot about perfumes. Woody, Floral, Citrus etc... However, all that sniffing of at least 7 different types of scent has left its mark on my nose. Something is quite wrong with it now but I cannot tell... Am glad to be home breathing in the night air of the desert.   I have been restored to much of my original strength thanks to many reasons, all of which I am certainly thankful for... 1) Saturday night's feast of exotic crabs! (Hey that's really rare considering that I live in a desert!) 2) Sunday night's feast (again!) of soft, tender, succulent beef! (You don't expect me to BLATANTLY say that I feasted on a human right!?) 3) In a funny kinda way, the infernal exercise of shifting a coffin-like sofa to the lithons room. (Which meant TWO staircases up!) 4) Not to forget that I am  nosferatu . (Muahaha...)  Thus with renewed vigor I begin this week. Let's see how long I will last...

      For those of you who have been wondering 'when is he gonna stop fantasizing that he is a vampire', here is a pivotal day. I AM SICK. Yeah... and I don't mean mentally as a certain goldfish in my pond did mention, the scrolls that I have been studying about Father Freud does tend to screw up the mushy pink matter just behind my eyeballs. I'm physically down. Lack of fresh blood? Maybe. Lack of sunlight? I doubt it. Anyway I do hope to be up and sucking real soon.    Alert : Scary Movie 3 is gonna be out real soon... For all die hard fans, do try to get your hands on the trailer. I can hardly wait myself... (Well for those who have no idea what I have been rambling about, go figure... the title is 'Scary Movie' right? So be warned that it is not for those of weak or iwilldiefromlaughingtoomuch heart.)

      'I have never slept so much in my life... ' This statement is the reason why I am still awake at such an hour, just about one hour before sunrise... Yesterday was perhaps one of the most sluggish days in the span of my existence so far.  - Woke up slightly before noon. - Had lunch. - Slept. - Woke up for dinner. - Slept till close to midnight. Perhaps I shall make an oath not to ever do this again. Though the day may not exactly be the time where I am at my strongest, it is no doubt the time that I should at least devote to much planning and thinking. Sigh.

      Once again, much has happened within the span of the rising and setting sun. Today I saw something that interested me... A kind of bird has perched itself on one of the palm trees in my oasis and was calling out in a most remarkable way. There was a certain melancholy in its cry mixed with mystery and inexpressible joy. Puzzled, I began to listen with greater attention... The sound that issued from its beaks gradually spoke to me; of certain truths, certain joys and certain deaths... It was almost as if within that cry was nature itself searching for expression, to speak to the people of the land of universal conditions that have been around since the beginning of time... Then just as it came, the bird fell to the sand and died.  Now I hold its still warm body in my hand and with a swift bite, rip off its head and spit it away. Warm, red blood oozes from the hole in its neck and like a leech I place my lips to it and suck... As the life of the bird flows down my throat, a sudden rush hits me and I begin to suck harder and harder.   The dead bird lies withered at my feet. I smile and walk into the shade.

      Two major events. [Death] - The mother of my pet hamsters has passed away... Peacefully I hope for we discovered her in a hardened state with her eyes closed. Now she lies in the garden along with the many other hamsters that we buried before. May she find rest at last. I shall hold dearly the memories of her; running so happily in her wheel, the feel of her soft smooth fur in my hands... [Discovery] - Count Dracula walks the day!! Sunlight does not destroy him but only deprives him of his powers... Mmm... Now there seems to be more to the usual myths that we hear about vampires.

      Cold frosty morning... Memories of the previous night... Rewatched Dusk til Dawn and came to such a conclusion - my love for vampires surely does not extend to the grotesque blood suckers at the Titty Twister. Those vampires there are a degenerate breed, unworthy of the immortality that the darkness grants them. I have a theory that when you encounter a real vampire, you get the chill of the embrace of death... You are not supposed to get utterly disgusted or freaked out. That would be the job of ghouls, werewolves, zombies and the like... the lesser forms of Un-Dead. (no offence fellow Un-Deads...)  The reason why vampires have fascinated us for eons is that they are human and yet inhuman. They represent the darkness that we repress away deep down into the bowels of our unconscious, our capacity for hideous and senseless indulgence of desires... A vampire's evil is from a human source... Thus I look upon the glass darkly, searching for the Other in me that calls out for blood. Whoa... That has been a whole lot of rambling for someone who has just woken up. Impressed?

      Like the man who seeks to find the silver that occasionally shines in his oasis, I have found mine. I hold it in my hand as the moonbeams bounce off its cold metallic surface. Now the visitors to this refuge shall each find something to call their own... Their voices, their comments...

      Feeling tired from insufficient rest. Will recuperate. My obsession with the Un-Dead still throbs with the passion of my heart. For those who love the darkness as I do, I recommend...   Underworld : Could have been much better improved on but is nonetheless a show worth watching. Kinda reminded me of Vampire: The Masquerade. The setting and mood of the show is really well done but better cgi could have been used for the werewolves. I would also have liked to have seen more of my kindred's fangs too.

      Isn't it always such a relief when the sandstorm finally passes over. Or when the burning heat of the midday sun boils away to the cool evening breeze. This life has been always characterized by the many ups and downs. A kind of rhythm that our souls dance to... Anyway I know I should really go before the sandman comes so I shall linger no longer. Another week ahead. Plenty of adventures to come I'm sure.

      Inspiration hits me. So again the soul cries out for expression. Fingers move as fast and nimbly as the mind weaves... Then the tapestry is complete. I stand back and gaze...  This orb of blazing orange My source of eternal pain Drops below the horizon With fervour I live again  The thirst that drives me crazy The hunger that makes me mad The joy of crimson warm blood Only joy I’ve ever had  Shadows dance and surround me Darkness soothes the raging beast The whole world exposed meekly Milky flesh enough to feast  They say all the world’s a stage And everyone a player Yet I play no part in this Just watching like a master  Mortal coils and pains and woes Trivial matters to behold Compared to my curse and joy Yet there’s comfort in the cold  Much more than any other I lust for the pulse of life Not my own, seeking to own Bound like husband is to wife  It is for you that I live And for me you have to die Find rest in my tender kiss That is all in a goodbye  This orb of blazing orange My source of eternal pain Drops below the horizon With fervour I live again

      I am so full. Feeding time was ok. Not fantastic but compared to last night when I didn't really have much to eat, tonight was better. My thirst now satisfied by the beer I had last night, I shall perhaps abstain from that precious fluid for a while. Having read  Dracula  today, my fascination with the vampire is once again awakened. Like a dark and terrible thing it comes forth to fill my thoughts. Tonight I shall sleep late, taking comfort in the darkness and silence.

      The waters of life. When you have drunk 1.5 litres of it the desert seems like the amazon. Anyway, Oktoberfest was great. Now back to sober reality that involves more toil and sweat. Gold reserves are running low so I'd better start scrimping and saving. But not to worry. Someone will still be getting a present.    Blade 2 Soundtrack : Was very much inspired to go download it after watching the DVD. The kind of music that charges your adrenaline and makes you wanna go get some vamps or rock away to the beat.  Vertical Horizon - Go : Was greatly surprised and pleased to know that they released a new album. Other than the great single track 'I'm Still Here', the rest of the songs on the album all make good for easy listening, the kind of music you wanna have playing when you traverse the highways alone at night. The cover picture for the album is simply lovely. The promise of life in the desert... HA.

      The end of another tiresome week. Yet, like a infernal furnace where devils continually heap loads of coal into, the pressure and heat is bound to step up with each passing day until the precious brain inside my head starts to boil and melt, oozing fluid out of my ears, nose, eyes and mouth... Ok. Enough grotesque imagery. Forgive me.  Truth be told that the peace and stillness of the oasis has been disrupted lately. The furious desert winds and the premonition of a storm to come does bring about certain anxieties. Well, the oasis is far from defiled but it will have to be given fresh soil and new plantlife will have to sprout from its life-giving waters. If only the friend from the other oasis would understand. But then again as mentioned before, it comes as no surprise at times when we suddenly realise that we are actually quite alone.

      It always surprises me how life has lessons and meanings waiting around the corner, in places where you least expect. But it could perhaps be one of the reasons why its mysteries have always intrigued and eluded us.   Secondhand Lions : Heartwarming. Made me cry twice. Damn. Not gonna spoil the story for anyone but upon coming out of the darkness, I discovered that I learned something. The knowledge of it resonates within me like a drop of water in a perfectly still and endless ocean.   What was gained... Things like honour, true love, goodness, the beauty of life etc. These are things worth believing in. Regardless of whether they exist as truth or are just simply lies for the hopeful and naive, they are still worth believing in. We should believe in something and live by it not for its truth value but just simply for the fact that it IS worth believing in. I realise many of us often get bitter and jaded when certain things that we held as truth fails us... like when there is no such thing as honour, there is no true love that lasts forever... But we live on in glory and happiness if we continue to believe in them. And it is by believing in them that we are made better people, worthy of the lives we live.

       28 Days Later : A virus called rage. Music used effectively... at times getting so loud that I was driven to the point of discomfort. The only peace we get is that of silence and the countryside, away from the cities where there are lesser infected. Yet the condition of rage and violence displayed does not seem like anything foreign to us. The film has amplified what we are deep down inside. Deep inside we lust. Lust for the blood of others without knowing why. A hunger that may never ever be placated.  Waking up on a rainy afternoon at 2. Firstly, the weather is one to die for. Secondly, something inside you mourns for the many precious moments of the day that you failed to capture. Thirdly, as the night draws nearer you grin to yourself.

      Here I am before the glass. Either I am too free or just bored. Then again isn't everything like the Sun's journey? When it rises from the horizon, the desert's chill is dissipated and the world stands in a certain epic state of awe. Light once again brings promise to the darkness before and the glorious beams of the Sun seek out the deepest and darkest monsters of the sands. But yet this is but just the beginning. We all know what is to come. Lazy afternoon heat and scorching rays, peeling away at the layers of our hide. Haha. My hands feel numb now.

      Today I had lots of beer. Well, I failed to get myself wasted cause I had a little too much to eat and thus there was insufficient space for the precious liquid. Anyhow, I have come to the conclusion that the freshly brewed beer at Brewerkz is cheap and pleasant BUT I definitely still prefer an Erdinger or a Heineken to the Golden Ale anytime. Shall I explain further? Haha... One is Holland's world famous beer and the other is a tasty German wheat beir.   The search for a nicely shaped pint glass begins... Carrefour has been disappointing for my search yielded zilch number of pint glasses. Metro and Isetan, please do not fail me... =P

      "...as the Chinese forces tried time and again to test the US laser defences, screams could be heard all across the battlefield as infantry were left charred by the scorching beams... high velocity rifle shots echoed from invisible snipers, picking off the straggling survivors that escaped the lasers... tanks fried in the heat of concentrated laser beams... overhead, fighter jets continued their bombardment on the enemy structures, taking out their defences and then striking into the heart of their command centres..."  It has been a gloriously victorious night for fellow marine Jon and I as we trashed the computer AI back into the micro-chip components which it came from. Human coordination and intelligence has triumphed against the forces of technology once again. Until next time... chips will fry again. =P

It is merely 3.40 in the morning... This is good and bad but I shall have to return to the comfort of my bed. Tomorrow I shall be attempting to study at the academy.

      It's been a long time since I felt the lust for blood so greatly... Not to drink but just to see red warm blood being spilt and wasted... Tonight I shall have dark dreams...    The oasis had always been a place of refuge, where the weary and thirsty sought comfort in. But today the sanctity of this place had been defiled... This human of dark and malicious heart was discovered by several friends, in the very act of burning the trees and dumping ashes into the waters of the oasis... Soon she was overwhelmed, left in an empty tent and tied upside down. I approached this thing (for I don't even think that she deserved to be called a human) and looked closely at it... Malice still burned in her eyes and she spat as she screamed: "What refuge? What trust? These are all meaningless stuff for fools!! And because I have never sought comfort among all of you, I shall destroyed all that you hold dear!" I just smiled. She glared at me and prepared to hurl yet another stream of abuses. Silence. Followed by gurgling. More gurgling and gargling. Her glare was now a look of mute horror.  Right at her throat was a huge gaping hole. Veins and flesh hung loosely as a slow thick stream of blood flowed from the hole, covering her face and dripping from her hair. In my right hand clenched the missing portion of her throat.   "You have really fucked with the wrong group of people. This oasis is for the ones whom I love and in defiling it, you have threatened our peace."  More gurgling.   "You have eyes but yet you do not see the value of trust and kinship. You find meaning in disrupting the lives of those who seek nothing but peace and joy."  Slowly I placed both my hands on her bloodied face, moving my thumbs in a circular motion around her eyes. Then gently, thumbs and eyeballs connected. I pushed.   A Scream.  A sick bursting sound echoed through the tent as both my thumbs dug in snugly into the sockets, crushing her eyeballs. The comfortable feel of warm blood was all over my hands.   The bitch fell unconscious.  "I would drink from you but I think I'll pass. For all I know your blood is worse than poison. Besides, I think that I deserve better."  After washing my hands in a basin of water, I left that thing hanging and dripping in the oblivion of the tent. I pray that she remains alive. Her hell had only just begun.

      What does one say or feel when you awake at 14:38 in the afternoon and you realise that more than half a day is gone, victim to the fiend of sleep? Time is against me for the next two weeks and the habit and luxury of sleeping in late is no longer one that I can afford. There must be a way to strengthen myself... Perhaps more blood... I shall have to feed more.  Have been digging up some old music to listen to while reading... So currently my fav. band is Third Eye Blind. All three of their albums are just great. Apart from the singles that they released, and are thus probably the more conventional ones, I would really recommend the other tracks in their albums. Unconventional and meaningful. That's how I like it. For Third Eye Blind, it's all about expression.

      All essays are over and finally the time has arrived where I begin to panic for the exams... And even so, a part of me is really sore that me and my bud jon got kicked in our asses when we went gaming. The computer AI in Command & Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour really kicks real good ass. Even two veterans like us lost five times in a row without coming close to victory! Sigh. I swear that I will have my revenge soon enough... right after the 29th.   Well at least one thing is for sure. The end of the semester is inevitable, with either good or bad grades... It all has to end someway. Just like how technology has invaded our lives and we are slowly but surely losing our humanity to it... *grin*

      Today Dr G mentioned that the city is the place where everything is obscured and hidden... Thus isn't it true that the desert, being a place that is barren, should be a place where a certain lushness may be revealed? It is precisely because of its harsh conditions that life is valued even more in the desert and what that is usually taken for granted will be appreciated?   I find myself sleeping less lately... I wonder what the hell is going on with my system... Maybe I'm really becoming a creature of the night that has no need for sleep. Change is coming. I can sense it...

      It's a nice cool night. My mind's in a jumble of thoughts so I shall refrain from putting them down until I can get them sorted out at least. Well, here's something that has contributed to the puzzling brain activity...   The Matrix Revolutions : This is supposed to be the "End". Several questions that The Matrix Reloaded left unanswered have been answered, but from this third installment arise several other new questions... I can't say much about the plot yet as I am still in the process of making connections... What I CAN say is that among the three, this one has the coolest fight scenes and you REALLY have to check out the robots... oh my... the many many beautiful robots!!!

      Things are finally begin to settle down... With only one paper left to write, I hope that my mind will refresh itself for the final battle ahead. But I have yet to choose my weapons and armour. Perhaps I shall visit the armoury over the weekend.    Kill Bill : The name Bill is just there for the rhyme. All that the show is about is in the first word, Kill. Blood, violence, music all brought together and heightened to the state where your adrenaline pumps like a Formula 1 engine. This is a cool and graphic movie that shows us what we all want deep down inside - to slice and dice. I mean, as far as blood is concerned one can never have enough right?

        Delayed Update...      The Rocky Horror Picture Show : Basically the only thing rocky about this show is that it hits rock bottom on the list of movies that I've watched so far. I think the government should ban it to hell for another 28 years. It is basically plain black bullshit, disgustingly scripted and the characters in the show make the Terminator seem human. It still remains a puzzle why they even bothered to screen it. Perhaps it was for the benefit of people like me... so that we may now begin to appreciate movies that we used to curse, in light of this ancient piece of stinking crap.

      As you can see this test is bullshit. I'm more of a devil, ahem.   You are Form 2,  Angel : The Pure.   "And The Angel rose as holy protector for all that was created.  She fought with honor and valor to serve the good of the world.  But the coming of the mankind was her downfall; and end to purity."   Some examples of the Angel Form are Michael (Christian) and Hercules (Greek). The Angel is associated with the concept of virtue, the number 2, and the element of wind. Her sign is the zenith sun.  As a member of Form 2, you are a person of your word.  You generally keep your promises and give everything you do your best.  Although some people see you as overbearing sometimes, you know that you have to stay true to yourself and do what's right.  Angels are the best friends to have because they are brutally honest.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Wonderful. The sky is a dark orange and the wind constantly howls as small drops of rain begin to fall. The trees groan and sway in their efforts to resist the greater force of nature. Wonderful again.   Why do I find comfort in apocalyptic settings? Why are we fascinated with depictions of a dead world of the future? Maybe it is the peace that we get when we are finally annihilated. Not so much as to have a clean slate to start upon but rather to put an end to all the complexities of existence.   But what about the birds, the bees and the fish? They all lead relatively simple lives compared to us. They exist and they are happy. I remember finding joy in the simple things too. Even a breeze overwhelms me with such happiness and I smile. Oh all the lucky birds and fishes.    An Ode to Birds and Fishes  Little birdie that I see As happy as you can be Soon you'll spread your wings and fly Into the blue morning sky  In the clear river swims thee Little fishie so carefree Swim yourself as far away Here is not for you to stay  Though this land belongs to us Often we betray its trust Ever slowly bringing on Ushering Armageddon  [p.s. - there is a very good reason why I left out gerbils. *snort*]

      Today I decided to pop the Usana pills that my dad has been taking, the ones that he and his brothers have been claiming are so good for one's well-being. For the second time that I am taking them, they seem to have the same effect on me... I feel more tired. My dad claims that it starts off like that initially because the 'gaps' in my system are being filled... We shall see what happens I guess...  Here I am rambling once again. Today's jamming session saw two great guests... a great bassist and a fantastic keyboard/vocalist. My throat wasn't feeling too well today... perhaps even a little sore, thus singing was terrible. On top of that, the mic was kinda screwed up too... which made everything sound echoey. Looking forward to Labour Day, as Chelle promised to join my parents for a meal. Had a nice sharing session over the phone with her and it made me realise that the 'real' world (as many like to call it) is filled with so many assholes... yet these assholes each probably have their own views and function according to their own set of values. It is going to be difficult to learn to love everyone, knowing how they might be out to get you, how they just don't see things your way, but the key must be in understanding... We never really think about it but 'understanding' can be quite a loaded word with multiple applications in various scenarios. Understanding is the key that brings two foreign worlds together, creating a link and thus allowing greater empathy between two parties... We being to see that the stranger is no longer that different from us... and that he or she probably thinks of us as what we think of him or her. It is about projecting one's consciousness into that of another's... and then realising that you could very much have been like that...   Whoa. That's a whole load of shit. But then again it is something to think about. There is always the argument that there are certain people that you meet that totally cannot be related to or understood... The vastness of the world does indeed imply a certain diversity that can never be breached by even the greatest effort to understand. I guess we should all keep trying, but at the same time be content with the handful of people that we can and are able to bring ourselves to understand.

      Well the  Lord Of The Rings  wasn't as fantastic as I expected it to be... although the weapons and armour were simply amazing, it would have been a more worthwhile experience if they allowed us to take pictures. I mean, it's not as if we were gonna be selling the photographs that we took right?  While rummaging through my room last night, I stumbled upon an age old classic:  Dungeon Keeper : Evil is good. That's the motto of the game which allows you to play the role of a dungeon keeper that directs the construction of a dungeon and controls the various minions you have. Subverting the peaceful town above is your goal and you get to torture both enemies and disobedient minions at the same time!

       50 First Dates : Nice. This movie does have quite an original story-line and does not contain a single part that is dull. Adam Sandler is his same old funny self, though he is more serious in this film as compared to the others that I have seen. Rob Schneider is simply fantastic, with his utterly ridiculous and hilarious antics! =) Well, definitely a good light-hearted comedy to catch with friends and loved ones.   So there you have it. I've watched all the movies that I had to watch for the month of April. May will of course see many other wonderful films. Soon I shall experience middle-earth close up... to see with my very own eyes the magnificence and magnitude of Peter Jackson's recreation of Tolkien's  Lord Of The Rings !!!

      This is getting really bad. On Sunday I woke up at 3pm. Today I woke up at 2pm. Why am I spending so much time sleeping now??? There are so many things that I could be doing with all the free time that I have now!   I realise how much I like calamari and pork knuckles... not that they are the most healthy type of food to eat but they just taste so good. Anyway I've bought another box of Paulaner beer, thus giving me two nicely crafted pint glasses from Germany! My hopes for D&D are currently thrown into darkness... with Mok away on holiday for 2 weeks and Chelle no longer being enthusiastic about playing. Sigh. Looks like it will be a while before I can get to run my Dark Sun campaign. When Mok comes back in mid May, Jon will have to start preparing for his exams in June. NIE starts in July so basically I won't get to dm. How I miss the days where people were more committed to the game...

April draws to an end soon...   Paulaner beer has once again resurfaced in Carrefour, packed nicely in red carriers along with a free pint glass! I have made up my mind and I shall rush down to get them! Beer. I suddenly realise how much I miss it. But I must also remember not to EAT while I drink. Very crucial to my tummy.

      Today I awoke at 9 in the morning just to catch a movie...  Kill Bill Vol. 2 : An utterly disappointing sequel. The soundtrack pales in comparison to vol. 1, and the blood and action that everyone loved in vol.1 was missing too. Truth be told that for a good first hour of the movie I was falling asleep. A part of me could not believe that I was watching vol. 2 of the movie that had astounded me with it's fantastic soundtrack and bloody non-stop action... Hey Quentin, what happened? Try to keep it up next time ok?!

       Dawn Of The Dead : Just like the other zombie flicks, this one does not have a proper plot. Those who watch such shows just wanna see zombies and violence. I'm glad that there was a slightly greater focus on the characters and certain sarcastic lines do help to liven up the monotony of the zombies. On the whole, I would not recommend this show to people who hate brainless horror flicks but for those who just love such shit, (you know who you are) this movie will add nicely to the list of zombie films that you have watched. =)  A week of the holidays has passed and still I have yet to sit down and prepare for the Dark Sun campaign that I will be dm-ing. Well as it is always the case with me, inspiration and drive tend to go away with stress. The less time I have, the more I want to do but the more time I have, the less I want to do... Oh we who live in a universe of inverse relations.

      Deportivo La Caruna have managed to draw 0-0 with Porta. I must say that the game was boring tonight. The first half saw both teams playing conservatively with no one going all out for the ball. The second half was better with many shots for goal by Porta, but a curse seemed to be upon them as they kept having near misses. Deportivo basically played like a bunch of girls tonight. Their defence was good enough, but offense was pathetic with only three forwards supporting a corner kick! The Deportivo that kicked AC Milan's ass was definitely missing this morning. Hope they do better in the second leg.  Jamming was good today. Coordination was a tad rusty but Desmond bought new coated strings for his guitar and so things did sound a little better today. We've more or less finalized what songs we will be doing so now it's just a matter of improving on them. God help us. =)

      It's been a great day... spending time with chelle without having to worry about essays and exams! Gonna begin jamming once again soon... can't wait to worship heartily once again. Hope that we can make the deadline and get recording done by June. Must try to write at least another song... for more originality. If not at least 80% of the songs are going to be just covers that cannot compare with the originals!   The semi-finals of the UEFA 2004 Champions League draws near and though I am no soccer fan, I would really like to see how much more potential Deportivo is capable of! They trashed AC Milan real good previously! There is an issue that bugs me... 14" rims or 15" rims? That is the question.    50 First Dates  is also due for release on the 22nd of April! That makes three movies that I must catch. I just love Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider! They are my favourite hollywood jokers of all time and not to forget that Rob Schneider was simply hilarious in  Hot Chick ! Movies like that just turn you away from the seriousness of the world, and for once you laugh and become truly brainless...

      For those who don't have a fast turbo-charged car, I recommend  Need For Speed: Underground !!! The graphics are superbly rendered and the THX sound employed in the game does greatly to help players feel the speed that their rides are travelling at. On top of that, you get to select your favourite car and modify it as you would with a real car, with no ROV regulations of course. =) It's definitely another quality game by EA Games that adds to their many other successful titles.

Anyway I will have a whole 2 months to change it before NIE begins so help me God... Discussed some really controversial stuff in church today. Realised how far I might be from certain truths... truths that actually do matter.   Money is beginning to become of greater importance as I prepare to embark on a new phase of my life... No more spending for the moment and more saving for the future. I don't usually spend alot but when it comes to something that I like, I can kinda go out of control. I guess it's all about greater exercise of discipline when one grows older... there's no longer an excuse for being foolish and rash because you are an adult.

       I don't mean to offend any of T.S. Eliot's fans out there but his  Four Quartets     make absolutely no sense to me. Throughout the 4 poems I can find oxymoronic verses that go like 'the movement of pain that is painless' and 'united in the strive which divided them'. Maybe I've grown more stupid. Maybe Eliot is too smart for me. But why bother to write and publish something that people find hard to understand???

      Just some thoughts on the two Coetzee novels that I have read recently... Coetzee's presence in less marked in  Age of Iron  but in  Youth , it is obvious that the author has created a protagonist that is a pitiful loser simply because Coetzee insists on making him so. And what is it about Coetzee's writing? Both novels are about obsessive characters that go on and on about their condition. Read that in one novel and you might not think anything much, but when you see it in two you begin to wonder if the author has any other better story ideas. I bet that if I were to grab another one of his novels, it would be centred around a political issue with a main protagonist that spends half of the novel whining about how he or she is. No wonder Coetzee has to make references to Dante and other texts. His stereotypical characters would never be able to stand by themselves.

      The final sprint has started for the last paper on Saturday... Hope that I complete my revision in time. Ha.  Hellboy : Interesting story-line but the 2 hours clearly do not do justice to the comic proper. The producer and director could have easily added another hour to give non-Hellboy fans more background. On the whole, it's another of those movies like Underworld which shows promise but due to the lack of screen time, turns out like a half-cooked meal.

      Check out track number 5 on  City On A Hill: The Gathering ...   Jesus went to the garden And fell down on His knees Jesus prayed in the garden Of Gethsemane Not my will but Yours be done Father, not my will but Your be done  Jesus went to the mountain To bleed for you and me Jesus died on the mountain Called Calvary Why have you forsaken me? My God, why have You forsaken me?  Jesus rose on the third day Triumphant over sin Jesus spoke on the third day To Mary Magdalene Woman, why are you crying? He said, woman why are you crying?   This is a song filled with so much meaning and emotion... Yet I must admit that it did not leave an impression on me when I first listened to it. It's really amazing how people can actually write such songs!

      It is indeed a good friday today!!! Had lots of beer last night and I must say that Asahi dry draft beer is nothing fantastic.  The Passion of Christ : I don't think this needs to be said but the show is vividly bloody for a necessary reason. The blood and the wounds are a representation of how grotesque and terrible the burden of sin is to our mortal flesh. Christ underwent such pain just for us... generations and generations of sinners till this very day. Yet there are many who fail to see his love for us. I myself am guilty for not seeing the extent of his love many times too. It is truly his passion and love for us that we are able to enter into his kingdom.  This has been another one of those deeply meaningful shows... yet what it presents to us is a truth that has long been recorded in the bible. It's visual rendition definitely adds more impact to what we already know but the final question is this: Are we going to be changed by this? Or is this just going to be forgotten as another good movie that we have watched? I pray that I will remember His pain always and continue to draw closer and closer to Him.

      My final essay is finally over! I cannot believe it but for a long long while I will no longer have to fret over word limits and deadlines. If I ever have to stay up late, it will be because I'm busy playing games and not because I have essays to rush!!! Well the  Passion of Christ     will be revealed to me real soon so check back for a review.   Just in case there are those that are unaware of this: I am not a jazz lover but Astrud Gilberto has recently released a really good compilation of various songs. Perfect for the lonely people who love to go on late night drives just like me. =) Of course I will be reserving the songs for play in my new ride that should be arriving in June.

      Ok I know I should be writing my essay but well... hahaha... Just some reviews:  The Fast and The Furious : Well chelle told me it was a brainless show but upon viewing it, I repudiate her claim! =P Personally I felt that it is definitely much better than the sequel and the Toyota Supra... oh my... it actually trashed a Ferrari!!! Basically it's a show for true drivers who know what it means to push a manual car to revs above 3000rpm. =)  2 Fast 2 Furious : The predecessor of the first show is more vibrant and more colourful. Still another show for the true driver. I realise what is it about the show that makes it so good. It's not the actors or the actresses. It's not the music or the sfx. It's the sound of the engines as they roar with such sweet harmonious aggression.

      The Lush Desert is back in business with a brand new 'clean' look. Just a short update on the life of the Wanderer...   Examination in a week's time. Fortunately there is only one paper to sit for. Really looking forward to many good shows that will be coming soon... If I do catch them, do check back here for personal reviews. Ha.

      It is the month of April. Soon May will arrive and June will follow. I don't think there will ever be enough time to practice jamming... Recording in June seems to be rather impossible, considering the current standard that the band has. But once again no point worrying so much. God will provide the way and the answer. If we are not up to it, it will be obvious to us and we will not do it in June.   I've been thinking that the 'Lush Desert' pic should go... Hope for a better inspired picture to come to me soon then.

      The smell of fresh water pervades the air as the wanderer bends down and drinks... It is going to be a good year. A year filled with new challenges and new responsibilities. It will be a year of growth and experience. And as John Milton believed, experience is far much better from innocence. For through experience, there can be wisdom and the glory of the human spirit.

      The Champion's League: Porto have won the league for the second time! They really played well today while the Monaco side was filled with lack-lustre and brash mistakes. The scoreline says it all: Porto 3 - Monaco 0. Carlos Alberto scored the first, then Deco followed and finally Alenitchev sealed it. Still I hate Carlos Alberto for being so arrogant but Porto definitely deserved to win. Can't wait for Euro 2004 to kick off!

      Another week of tuition is over. It's not that I dread it but there is still a sense of relief that one gets just like how you feel when you come back from work and know that you won't have to think about it for a while. Well, I'm pretty happy with the gift that I got for my sis. Just hope that she likes it too when I pass it to her tomorrow.  With reference to my previous blog, I have realised that the Falken ST115 tyres are good but rather expensive and since I am on a budget, I've decided to go for the Falken ZE512 - which is supposed to be slightly lousier than the ST115 but also cheaper. Ok enough technical stuff...  The OC is really growing on me... and I think my favourite character has to be Seth Cohen. He's totally hilarious! Of course there's Ryan and Marissa who are such a lovely couple. The only other lovely couple that left an impression on me were Max and Liz from Roswell! Haha... ok I know this is not the typical kind of blog you'd expect from a guy but what the hell.

       Shrek 2 : It was entertaining. Although there were quite a few movie spoofs within this movie, this sequel did not strike me to be as hilarious as the first Shrek. If there was anything that gave a gleam to the film, it would definitely be Puss'in Boots!  Got to make sure that I get my ass out of the house tomorrow... to buy my sister's present. Alas the dilemma that I have been in is finally resolved - I shall get 195/55/R15 ST115 Falken tyres along with OZ Superleggera rims! Hope that I will have enough cash...

      I'm not really into drama series but  The OC  has been rather entertaining so far... To add on to that, the soundtrack is quite respectable too, with many good tunes - not exactly the typical pop songs but uniquely pleasant nonetheless. The very first song on the cd is entitled  Paint The Silence  by this group called  South . A cool song that comprises mainly of three chords: B/F#, A and E. Place a capo on the first fret of your guitar and you sound exactly like them! The strumming pattern is also really easy to follow so do give it a shot!

      Food glorious food! Tim sum for lunch and pizza for dinner, what more can a person ask for?! Yes, my attempts at weight loss have been thwarted by the recent bout of dinners and lunches... May draws to an end soon and I will only have June to lose the excess baggage that clings to my flesh. Hahaha...   Desmond has left for his mission trip and so there'll be no jamming for the next month. Will be viewing  Shrek 2  soon so check back for my review.

      It feels a little weird not to have my handphone with me today but there is a sense of seclusion and peace too... Got a wedding dinner in a few hours time and I hope I'll meet familiar faces there tonight. Last night was also a night of surprises, bumping into a couple of friends and even a Sec 2 Indonesian classmate! We've all really grown up and are no longer the innocent little brats that we used to be. Gold reserves are at an all time low again and I look forward to the next week for a fresh new supply to fill the coffers.

      Oh I'm so tired! Woke up at 7:45 a.m. this morning and rushed down to the west to attend the appointment briefing by MOE. Then I proceeded down to Katong for another session of Battlefield, followed by jamming at Desmond's church and tuition for 4 hours! As I sit here typing, I can hardly believe that I am still awake with the energy. I guess 25 for me is still a phase that's filled with lots of vitality. =)

      Here's the review I promised...   Troy : Two thumbs up, followed by two toes!!! It's another war epic that deserves to be shown on the big screen and watched by millions all over the world. If you think the battles in The Lord Of The Rings were big, you will stand in awe of the 50'000 Greeks that lay siege to Troy... Not to mention Archilles, whose fighting style puts the fellowship to shame! This movie is a must watch for all. Trust me. The only thing that comes close to lame is the ridiculous love scene between Briseis and Archilles that results from her 'attempt' to kill him. Enough said from me. Go catch the movie yourself and experience the majesty for yourself.

      It's been an uneventful day today... Had a nice dinner at the Conrad Hotel though, with my cousin who just went into BMT. Did some catching up and both agreed that I must get a ride in his EVO soon! My room's slightly cleaner but I still got lots to do tomorrow... Didn't get to jog again tonight... sheesh.

      Most of the room clean-up project has been completed. My table is now a media station... with my hi-fi set plugged into the computer, mp3s and videos will now be in surround sound! A proper reading corner has also been set up in place of the old dusty hi-fi rack. Now the only thing left to do is to clear up the stray pieces of paper on the floor and not to forget, the corner of wires and dust that is the perfect breeding ground for other indigenous blood-sucking, dirt-gobbling life-forms. My room transformation shall be complete by Monday. Knight's honour. =)

      It's always a nice thing to have someone whom you can just sit down and chat with at any time, especially when you are totally comfortable with the other person. =)  I have made my resolution for the month of May. I will get both my room and my body tidied up before June. How will I do that? Tomorrow I shall vacuum the floor and clear up my table. Jogging will now increase to twice a week. Motivation is what I need, now that I have a tentative plan in place.

      Sheesh. Now jamming sessions are replaced by going down to Katong to play Battlefield Vietnam. As much as I enjoy gaming with the guys, a part of me wishes that they would show a little more commitment in attempting to refine ourselves in terms of playing our songs. I'm totally sure that recording will not be possible by June and even if we were to go ahead with it, it would an utter waste of money.

      Lately I've been caught up with playing  The Temple of Elemental Evil , a computer RPG that's based on a D&D adventure module. OF course I have my own fair share of criticisms about the game but being bored and lame, I've been playing it. Think it's time to stop and do something constructive with the remainder of the holidays.   Good news. It seems that Chelle has grown slightly addicted to Battlefield Vietnam. She gave me a pleasant surprise when she asked me when we would be having another go at the game... =) Oh well, she's gonna be busy for the next week so the battlefield will have to wait I guess.  The Corolla suffered a minor injury today as I discovered that a screw somehow got itself embedded in the right rear tyre - the exact one that I had to change because it was punctured almost a year back! Looks like a visit to the tyre shop will be taking place real soon.

      Ate a lot for dinner again. But how can I help myself when it was chili crabs at Jumbo Seafood Restaurant?! Had lots of fun today... The initial plan was to go jamming at Desmond's church but as everyone was clearly caught in the heat of battling vietcongs, we ended up playing LAN for a good 4 hours. Once again I must commend EA Games for coming up with such a fantastic sequel to Battlefield 1942 - Battlefield Vietnam!!!   Starsky & Hutch : At best, the show was entertaining and amusing but I certainly preferred  50 First Dates  to this. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller were atypically themselves in the movie and it verges on lame and corny jokes at times. Will Ferrel did play a funny-in-a-sick-way role as this gay guy that's obsessed with dragons!

      It has been a day of surprises! Yes yes yes. Thank you so much dear chelle. In 2 days time, I will be 25. How fitting that I shall be celebrating my birthday just before I begin a whole new phase of my life. I'm actually feeling tired as I type this entry so hopefully I am gradually beginning to sleep earlier...   Exercising has been fruitful and I feel so much healthier, lighter and warmer. Shall continue to fight the fats! Finances have been a little messy of late but I definitely will sort it out before NIE. Gonna implement saving and resist unnecessary spending!

      Spent a good 3 hours washing the car and then carefully giving it a full body wax. Phew. Black does look so good when it is given that gloss! The only minor regret that I have is the lack of proper shelter in the house for the car, making it vulnerable to rain and shine, birdshit and carelessmaidswhosprayyourcarwithwaterwhilewateringtheplants.  EDITED : Well it seems that parking the car in the porch does not prevent those darn birds from shitting all over it!!! In the span of an afternoon, I had to clean away birdshit from my car roof twice!!!

      Finally met up with the elusive z-stab man and got my hands onto two sets of the acclaimed device. Through a tiring DIY process, I've successfully installed it in my ride. It is worth mentioning that I almost got fried by the car battery three times too... heh. Anyway, I'm glad that I learnt something new today.

      The Continued Misfortunes of Night Cycling... As a continuation of a previous episode of night cycling, my friends and I picked up our bikes from Chelle's place at around 11pm. We began with a promising start, as we cut through the EXPO and made it safely to the ECP. But the hands of cruel fate had plans for us... We stopped at Bedok jetty to enjoy the night breeze before we continued with the remaining stretch of the ECP. As we drew closer to 7-Eleven, Jon suddenly realised that his front tyre were flat and his rear wheel was also losing air fast. Shit happens. It was 1:30am and all the bicycle shops were shut. There was no way we could continue the planned journey without tubing and an air-pump.  The final decision: wait till morning, get Jon's bike fixed, continue home... It seems to be a simple plan but what were we gonna do while waiting? Well, we decided to drink, eat and make merry. In fact 2 whole barrels of Heineken were downed by just the four of us! At 6am, fatique and alcohol finally persuaded us to sleep for a few hours. Thus I lay on the rocky wave-breaker and fell asleep to the sound of waves and the smell of seawater. The rest that ensued is too tedious to narrate on this blog. All I can say is that once again I found myself pushed to certain physical and mental limits. Whoo Hoo.

      Collected the new ride today and rushed straight down to AMK to get the new rims and tyres fitted. Never has the Toyota Vios looked more beautiful... Original bodykit, OZ Superleggera, 195/50/R15 BF-Goodrich G-Sport tyres... Yes the car may be made in thailand and there may be slight imperfections here and there, but it is definitely a keeper! I will try to get some photos taken and posted as soon as I can!   On another note, me dad has also gone nuts... coz he too changed his stock 175/70/R14s to light-weight 15" Kyowa Racing rims along with 195/60/R15 Michelin Energy tyres!!! Justin must have been very happy at all the money he earned from both father and son. Although my rims cost almost twice the price of my dad's, I have no regrets. Like the car, they are here to stay.

      This song by Dashboard Confessional has gotten me hooked onto it... Especially the vocals!     Saints and Sailors   This is where I say I've had enough And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound,  a trophy display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better.  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment  is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence.  Wandering this house  like I've never wanted out And this is about as social as I get now. And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you Cause they would never do,  I would never do. Never  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence.  So don't be a liar Don't say that "everything's working"  when everything's broken. And you smile like a saint  but you curse like a sailor And your eyes say the jokes on me.  But, I'm not laughing You're not leaving Who do I think I am kidding? When I'm the only one locked in this hell  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence.  So don't be a liar Don't say that "everything's working"  when everything's broken.

      Just finished watching an exciting soccer match between Czech Republic and Netherlands... The Czech Republic won 3 goals to 2!!! Euro 2004 is really turning out to be a season of the underdogs, with Greece and Czech Republic definitely advancing into the quarter finals.   The OZ Superleggera rims are gonna cost quite a bomb at $235 each! Can't wait for the new week to begin... It will be so much better to have a 109bhp car that reaches the century mark under 10s. Played against a Nissan X-trail on my way home just now and here's what happened...     Nissan X-Trail (2.5 Auto) VS Toyota Corolla (1.3 Manual)    The traffic light turned green. I had my air-con turned off in order to gain a slight increase in horse-power. The Corolla moved off with a promising head start... Either the automatic gearbox or the driver of the X-Trail was slightly slow in reacting to move off. I was filled with exhilaration as the Corolla was leading!!! From the corner of my eye the X-Trail began to catch up... I looked down at the meters and saw that I was at 3rd gear pushing well into 5000 rpm... The X-Trail overtook and continued to pull ahead... The Corolla was already hitting 110km/h on the speedo and so I decided to play it safe and relax on the accelerator. Yes I lost but at least for the first few seconds, I am sure that the Corolla kicked the ass of another vehicle with an engine that was two times more powerful. I dare say that the Corolla hit 100km/h first! Imagine that. If only I was already driving the Vios... =)

       The Chronicles of Riddick : Definitely an epic sci-fi movie that deserves more than just 2 hrs of screen time. It is a story that is set in such an immense world that the lack of sufficient detail hinders proper appreciation of it rather than un-complicating it. The Lord of the Rings came in a trilogy and still many feel that it did not do enough justice to the book. This movie leaves us wanting to know more, in a way very much like Underworld. Maybe next time the producers can get their lazy asses to add on another hour of screen time so that a good movie may become a great one - which is the least it deserves in the case of this movie.

      Drove up to Ipoh for the weekend to spend some time with the family, so here's the Ipoh update...  Food was the only attraction. Ipoh hor fun was great, seafood was great, and this certain specialty chicken with bean sprouts dish was good too. Actually the bean sprouts, being locally grown, were fat and juicy. The chicken was just average. Singapore chicken is far better. Oh and I must mention the ice-kacang at the Ipoh stadium. Actual nuts were added to the ice shavings, along with gula melacca, to make it a unique and refreshing desert. Ipoh ice-kacang beats the boring Singapore version anytime! Did get to drive quite abit on the return trip and boy was it boring like hell... Well that's it I guess. There's not really anything else worth blogging about with regards to Ipoh. The other minor details are for those who would be interested and therefore ask me in person. =P

      Whoa... lots of alcohol intake lately. But at the same time, I've been exercising quite a bit. The old corolla will be scrapped really soon and I can only hope that my new ride will arrive early July... preferably before I begin NIE. Indeed I've been bumming greatly lately and I don't care what others may think... This is my last chance to slack before NIE begins so I'm gonna make the most of it! =P

After having not gone on a proper cycling trip for a long while, Thursday's trip was not only enjoyable but it brought back many fond memories. I'm also glad that I bought the GT Aggressor as a good bike definitely makes cycling a whole lot easier and enjoyable. Will go on another trip soon... especially since we definitely have to get our bikes back from chelle's home.

      It's been a while since I blogged and it was simply because I've been trying to complete  Morrowind . Once again the massive world of Vvardenfell is not only breath-takingly immersive but it makes me wonder at the future possibilities of rpgs when technology would be even more advanced!   Anyway, I've caught the sneaks for the latest installment of Harry Potter...   Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban : A great third installment to the Harry Potter series. I'm glad that in the standards set by the previous two movies are maintained in this one. I must add that the creature effects for the hippogriff were done superbly! I've only seen pictures of the hippogriff and the visuals from the movie does help in bringing it to life in my mind. A movie that everyone should be catching in June!    Many thanks must go out to chelle for shedding much appreciated light on the history of the various characters in JK Rowling's world - the stuff that only one who has read the books would know...

      Whoa... Tomorrow I get to teach a class of 19 secondary school students! This is part of the Pupil Experience module that only English Language teachers have to go through. Why this is the case I do&nbsp;not know. It is only gonna be an hour long, followed by another half hour of debrief by our tutors. Hope it goes well, and that the students will be cooperative.   Tomorrow's a happening day for me... Will update this blog as soon as I get back!

      A damn traffic jam caused me to be late for my first PCE511 lesson! Take goodness that the tutors was nice enough about it and allowed me to sign in the attendance file. I shall not repeat this again.

      There isn't really much that I want to say about my day... My car has been injured by some asshole out there. Repairs are gonna cost me $180. Fuck it all. What kind of world is this coming to when my car that is only one month old gets hit by some unknown person who drove off!!??    I guess no one understands how I feel right now. If I was younger, I might cry about it... just like how a child cries with hurt when his favourite toy is broken and even if it is repaired, the blemishes will always be there. It's all just a very sick feeling - knowing that something dreadful has happened and you wish it could all disappear...

      First day at NIE went smoothly. The module arrangements are still a little puzzling as a single module code actually has like 6 different components that are distributed randomly to be done by various individuals over the period of this semester. Well, I'll soon figure it out I hope.     Realised that carpark 4, the place where I park my car, has a really long flight of stairs that will prove to be my source of fitness in the days to come. Went up to the computer lab today to print more notes when I realised that I lost my NIE matric card. (which was needed to log-on to the system...)  Thank God that I had previously left my card in the computer lab itself and the counter girl returned it to me from the lost-and-found drawer! Imagine that!     Also glad that my NIE schedule has not screwed up my tuition timings, and has also left me with enough free time to spend with chelle or projects later... =)

      The orientation turned out to be great fun! The team activities were both challenging and interesting too. It has been a long time since I enjoyed 'play'. On the whole, Wednesday turned out to be great as I got to watch a movie later on at night, at Orchard Cineleisure.   I, Robot : To my surprise, the movie turned out to be more thought provoking than I had thought it would be. It was not just a trashy sci-fi flick about robots gone amok. Amidst the special effects lies several messages about the dangers of technology and the blurring of lines between robot and man... Thumbs up!

      NIE finished surprisingly early yesterday. It was a long day that consisted of a mini concert and many speeches. Lunch and tea were provided, but the quality and quantity of the food left much to be improved upon. Given the amount of us that were present, they should have had more food points instead of just a miserable 3 which meant that we had to queue for a kilometre in order to grab a bite. The games will begin tomorrow, and they'll be conducted by OBS apparently so let's see what's installed.

      In approximately 8 hrs time, the much dreaded NIE orientation shall begin... I do not dislike NIE, its just the lameness that is often attached to orientations that puts me off. No one likes orientations - especially those where they organise really stupid games to help you mingle around, almost as if they were so convinced of your utter inability to socialize. The insult just gets worse when you get older.

      This is simply amazing... Today I awoke with a throat that was not as sore as yesterday but when I opened my mouth to speak, no words came forth! I can't remember the last time that I lost my voice so this is all pretty amusing to me. Can you imagine if I was already teaching and I lost my voice?   On a disappointing note, great bands like  Dashboard Confessional  do not distribute their albums to small little islands like Singapore and those poor few people like me have to pay a good whopping $41 just to purchase an imported CD of theirs. Don't worry though, as I will get my hands on their songs no matter what!

      Here I am, stuck at Sin Ming Toyota Service Centre. Thankfully, an internet connection allows me to blog away my boredom. Once again I slept at 5am in the morning and was forced to wake up at 9:30am. That leaves me with approximately 4.5 hrs of sleep. Woohoo. Well, at least there's a coffee machine here that churns out sugarless coffee and splendid teh tarik. =P  I really do hope that my steering wheel will be properly aligned when I collect my ride later. It's already past noon and I expect my stomach to begin waking from its slumber soon... so that I might once again be filled with hunger... Ok, I know this is beginning to sound really crappy. I'm actually blogging down every single thought that's running through the neurons of my brain. Well my dear readers, this is what boredom does to you. It makes you blog excessively and in this case, meaninglessly. I recall times when I had so much to do that I couldn't even be bothered to blog. Now it's an escape, a form of entertainment for me.  Last thoughts before I go... I've been itching to purchase more mods for my car but I know that I have to save up and I'm not trying to build a race car. Pray that I will continue to resist temptation... May my bank account balance be a reminder to that. =)

      Hello NIE!!! Just went down to my prospective site of training for registration today... It's located really deep within the bowels of NTU, a quiet place amidst the green. The campus didn't seem too big so it should be a breeze to navigate and what's more important is that parking is FREE!!! Though unsheltered, there is a great amount of parking space so I guess it's rewarding for me to drive. Oh, and did I mention the long drive to and fro on the PIE is also great for cruising at high speeds. Heh.

      This is another one of those long rambling entries so for those of you that hate ramblings, please feel free to close your browser window.  It's funny how a comic inspired movie like Spider-man is able to touch on so many issues that we can relate to. Peter Parker was basically an average teen before he became a superhero. He too struggles with his studies and with his financial needs just like everyone of us. Yet, it has never come across his mind that he does not need to study or that he can use his super-powers to get him some cash. Maybe because that's the way the story goes and he is supposed to be a hero afterall. Well, the two issues high-lighted by Spider-man 2 is perhaps the tension between self-sacrificial acts of heroism and the need for personal self-fulfilment. Peter emerges from the movie as a person who initially struggles but then finally gives up his own dreams and needs in order to serve the public good. Yet I am sure that many of us know of a certain school of thought that advocates the endless striving towards the achievement of one's dreams and goals, no matter what it takes. So the question is, which of these paths should we take? We may not be superheroes but certain choices in life will require us to make sacrifices for the ones that we love, and sometimes these sacrifices may entail forgoing certain ambitions and dreams. Whoa... because suddenly from an angle, our superhero movie might seem very much to be a tool of government propaganda - to put the needs of the society before the aspirations of the self! Well, I believe that most of us have done what Peter has done at one point of time or another. So the many questions that remain are: When do we pursue our dreams? How far should we soar if there were no limits? Do we still give our aspirations the priority that they deserve? Do we always have to be held back by the people around us?  With these thoughts I leave you. I do not have any answers myself, but I believe that within these answers lies the key to living a happy life.

      This review is slightly delayed but here it is nonetheless...   Spider-man 2 : This sequel is one that is as good as, if not better than the first movie. What I really liked about this movie, apart from the visual effects, is the depth that has been given to the characters. Just like in the first Spider-man, we see more about Peter and how he has to deal with the impact that being a superhero brings to his social life. Together with a great display of special effects, Spider-man emerges from this sequel as a superhero that we are able to understand better, and thus love more.

      Greece has done it. They are the champions of Euro 2004!!! Not only have they defeated host nation Portugal, they had also previously defeated defending champions France and ended Czech Republic's undefeated streak! This is perhaps one of the best testaments to the power of cohesive teamplay. No individual glory-grabbers, just a team who defends, moves and attacks together. Fantastic.   The entire Euro 2004 experience has been great for me, especially since I have had the luxury of the holidays to watch almost all of the matches since day one. Now the next big thing for soccer would be the world cup in 2 years time...

      Birthday celebrations spun out of control literally. My 25th birthday will be remembered as the day that I got drunk. Very drunk. Arrived at Jade at around 7:15pm and ordered my first bottle of heineken. 5 bottles, 4 shots, 1 mug later, I found myself offered some brandy by Jarrel. I finished it and then placed my head on the table. Everything around me was beginning to spin around at a blinding pace... Dark terrible vomit emerged from my mouth as I spurted forth that putrid liquid like a 'Merlion'.   So that's what it feels like to be drunk. It's all about vomitting and having your whole world spin around you. Thanks to all the friends around - Len, Shu, Gail, Dawne and Jack, that I managed to get back to chelle's place alive. A big thank you to chelle too... for washing me up and keeping watch over me while I slept.

      Lessons in NIE have come into full swing. Still kinda blur because a good two-thirds of my modules are just beginning and I have much to anticipate and prepare for... Would also like to take up more tuition but they have to be near!!! It's just too bad that the lady who contacted me stayed all the way in Bedok.

      It has been a nice cool rainy day. Been feeling lethargic even though I woke up at 1pm... Last night chelle and I went down to Devil's Bar for Denise's farewell. The music wasn't that great but I had fun. It was the first time ever that I went clubbing with my baby.  Well, I drank little compared to my usual standards but I think chelle was a little high cause she couldn't even walk properly to the car. On the drive back to her place, taxi drivers tried to kill us both with their remarkably reckless driving. They should all deserve to get into really bad accidents and lose their livelihoods. And when they look back, they will realise that their dumb and inconsiderate actions were the precursors of their present misfortune. But then again, I don't think they are even capable of such intellectual reflection - if they are, they wouldn't be driving taxis now would they? Muahahahaa...

      Woke up at 8am today just so that I could send my car to have her rear fixed. Collected her back at 6pm from Seng Kim's motorworks.&nbsp;The restored bumper definitely does not look brand new but it is an acceptably good job, considering that I only paid $180 for it. (compared to a good $700++ if I had sent it back to Borneo Motors!) Let's hope that no other misfortunes will happen.

      For the past few weeks I've been kinda fascinated with  Dashboard Confessional  and even started learning how to play and sing a couple of their songs. Here's what I've successfully learnt so far...  1) Vindicated  2) Hands Down  3) Saints and Sailors  4) So Impossible  5) The Best Deceptions  To anyone who wants the chords for the above songs, please do feel free to drop me an email.

      Was late for school today and so I pushed the vios slightly harder today. Travelled at a constant speed of 120km/h with no problems with ride handling and stability. Until next time.

      My car is only one month old. Imagine the agony and frustration that hits you when you wake up in the morning to realise that your bumper has been hit. It must have been some evil, vile-hearted driver who after hitting my bumper, proceeded to drive off into the darkness last night, while I was giving tuition. And it had to be me. My car, my first vehicle, the first expensive thing that I own and am paying for with my hard earned money. God has allowed this to happen to me. Fate has chosen me out of the millions... All I can do is accept this. And secretly deep inside, though the bible teaches us to forgive, a darkness grows and I pray that the culprit responsible for my plight will meet with a terrible car accident... and as he bleeds or burns to death, trapped in his car, I will be sniggering in my room.    That's just how unfair life is. You can be good and try your best to do things right, but it is always so easy for someone else to come along and screw it all up for you.

      Don't mistake this to be merely a site for my car. It's really a site for me to voice my thoughts and opinions on the things that I love - d&amp;d, computer games, songs, poems, stories, movies, cars... Perhaps you may call this blog the hobby blog. =)

      M. Night Shyamalan's latest installment is definitely not as disappointing as  Unbreakable . Of course if you are a fanatic movie critic, this film will not satisfy you with its many loopholes and abrupt ending. Personally, what I liked about the film was that the idea/twist was a good one and if you are willing to ignore the little flaws, you shall see the bigger picture and be able to consider the issues that Shyamalan wishes us to think about. On a literary level the film does hold alot of meaning but as a movie for the typical movie-going crowd, it might not be able to make any waves.

      Well, that's the title of  Nine Day 's new album that should be out real soon... I really liked their debut album,  The Maddening Crowd.  Hope the new album will be just as good or even better! For those who have not yet discovered this greatly gifted band, here are a few songs that you can check out for starters: 1) Absolutely (Story Of A Girl) 2) If I Am 3) Sometimes 4) Crazy 5) Revolve 6) Another Day Basically I could go on and give you all the tracks on their album. Get what I mean?
