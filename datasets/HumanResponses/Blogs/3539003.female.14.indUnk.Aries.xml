       O= optimist P= pessimist  My argument with myself:  P: Nooooo! Stop thinking about him! O: Why? He's my boyfriend. I'm allowed to. P: You're obsessing! O: What?! No I'm not. I just like him a lot. P: You're crazy if you think it's going to work! O: Ok... Then I'm crazy! P: So you think it will work out between you two? Do you think he's "the one"? O: Yes and possibly. P: Insane! I can't believe you! You know what is going to happen! The same thing that always happens. You will get your hopes up and then He will drop you flat on your face! O: He would never do that! Not in a million years! P: What makes you think that? O: He's different. P: How so? Every guy you've ever met has hurt you in some way, and he is a guy... Right? O: Of course he is a guy! P: So how do you know HE won't break your heart too. O: I just know. P: Oh my gosh! I don't know why you are doing this to yourself again!

       Look at me. Look at my eyes. You see a tear. Now look into my eyes as I gaze aimlessly into yours. Grief, hope, anguish, love. I know you can see it all. We lock each other in a stare, trying to freeze us in this moment. A conversation passes between us, but no words are spoken. Unsure of what to do next, I run my fingers through your hair. Then we hug. This position once so odd now becomes the most comforting thing in my entire world. Then the bell rings. Yes... the bell. Once it was my savior and now I am betrayed by the bell. We stand hand in hand as the world goes on around us. I tell you I love you. You say it back. I weekly say good-bye. I walk away, only twenty steps away. I look back to see you watching me... A fading memory. I run back and kiss you. A perpetual kiss. When we part and walk away, the warmth remains on our lips. You take with you a huge part of my life. Not only do you have my entire heart, you have my first kiss too. Remember me fondly forever, because I will never forget you. I love you. Good-bye.

       I walk into the only entrance of my prison. School once was my escape, but now my confinement. We are but ruthless animals in a cage. The rules here are almost amusing. No permanent marker, no writing on clothing, no cameras. So for these last few days of Jr. High we can't take pictures!? Outrageous! Am I supposed to remember everything? I have no clear images of these last moments with my dearest friends. Just foggy memories continuously fading. We have virtually three days left of school and NOW the teachers are piling stuff on us. Finals one after another. Last minute projects are popping out of nowhere! But on to of that, we have to deal with the pain of saying good-bye. I'm not even strong enough to face one of those problems by myself, let alone all of them. Prison.

       Why do I like him? He's funny We have so much in common He is so cute We have the same sick mind He likes friends (I know huh!) Unlike other guys he can actually match He is super sweet Never is he mad He is intelligent He is open, almost... ok he's blunt He is witty He is NOT gay (see, not all the good ones are) And yes ladys, he is real... and taken.  I dunno why he's with me. I didn't think he'd like a girl, well... like me. I mean, I'm  Not to bright(I almost get streight Fs) I'm fat I'm ugly I'm a bitch sometimes I'm clinicly insane (no... realy) That seems like a lot to deal with, don't you think? I don't know what the boy sees in me. But this is like a dream come true. Every girl dreams that some day the perfect guy will show up one day, even a girl like me. Well, mericals do happen. I guess there's hope after all. Even for a girl like me.

       I've fallen so deep, so fast. I don't know what to do with myself. But I know I feel so good. I love to look at him, listen to the voice of the Aries. I wish I had the courage to go up to him and kiss him. I want to, but yet fade away into the shadows of fear and questioning. Dose Aries like me? How can I tell? What if he doesn't and I'm making a fool of myself, stumbling over my feelings. A little girl with a crush just out of her reach. What if he dose like me too? If he asks me out do I say yes? Of course I do! Even though we will not see eachother as much as we'd like, who says it cant work! Right...? But what if it won't work... I guess we'll have to find out...

       It's hard to think that we have less than a week together. Then, it's over. Most of my friends will fly away together leaving me without wings... aimlessly hobbling around trying to find replacement wings and friends. I almost don't want to go to school. I don't want to say good bye. We can say we'll be friends forever, but the truth is, no matter how much you hate to admitt it, people grow appart. High School is the hardest most crusal part of anyone's life, and I'm left to face it without my sheild, my crutches, my wings. I'm alone. Clanless. Friendless. As every body stands up in High School, still hand in hand walking together, helping eachother; I wander, holding my own hand, being crushed and stepped on by the clans of friends. That's me. Flattend to the ground. The loner. No friends, no passion, no will to live. I'm starting over. Never have I stayed in one school for more than two years... never. So every other year I am forced to start over. This is like the others, but different. This is more important to me than anything else. I can't start over again. Mabey I'll be invisable, never get into another relationship again. I know it will just shatter like the rest. I can't stand to be hurt one more time. I can't pick up the shards of my broken heart alone anymore. But I have no choice. Some people say "The future depends on you", but really you depend on the future. So I'm depending on the future... that tomarrow will be a better day. I will be optomistic and spend as much time as I can with my friends, for I only have a short time with them. Untill June 9th, 2004, 3:20pm: Then it's...   Good Bye.  >

       Stroke my face that's resting on your lap. Tell me it'll be ok. Tell me we will be together forever. Tell me you love me, you'll never forget me. We'll still see each other all the time. Nothing will change. Look into my eyes with your sympathetic eyes. Everything will be alright.  No! Stop! You're lieing! I'll never see you again! Everything will be different! You don't love me! You won't returne my calls! You'll forget my name! Stop!  Go back to the week before, we are all together in Washington D.C. Now back to reality. We are drifting away. You are together, I am alone. Stroke my face that's resting on your lap. I'm crying. Tell me it's ok to cry. You're crying too. Hug me. Please dont hurt me. I love you. It'll be ok.

      You may be wondering why my site is called "Spaghetti Wall". It is a joke between me and some friends. We went on the Washington D.C. trip with my school. We were at a nice Italian restraunt and I got plain spaghetti noodles. One of my friends pointed out that if the noodles were cooked, they'd stick to the wall. She grabbed a handful and sure enough, the spaghetti stuck to the wall! For some reason, I couldn't pick the noodles off the wall with my fingers. I couldn't get a hold of them. What else could I do? I ate the spaghetti of the wall! Everybody though it was so funny!  Do you remember the "Spaghetti Wall"?

      I walk into a life long summer  memory that I haven’t seen for two years. Everything is so familiar. The buildings, the people, even the attitude of the whole place are the same. I love the fact that year after year I can depend on it to be it’s old comforting place. I feel like I’m in a dream. I know every face I see, even the parents, but I fear they don’t remember me. I fear I’m just a confusingly familiar face. I’ve changed so much from last time they’ve seen me up till now. I wonder if they can see that. I am curious to find out if how I am now will effect the way I function in this place differently than before. I walk into this life long summer memory, fading into a new reality.

      It’s amazing really. You’ve been through every season of my sole, and you still love me. You have always been there for me. You’ve never backed away, no matter how unbearable the weather was. It’s hard to find people loyal enough to go through with that. I’m just lucky I guess.  THE SEASONS OF MY SOLE: Summer~ when everything is doing well. My life is going smoothly. No bumps in the road.  Fall~ when my colors fall off. My life falls apart. Unlike a leaf, I don’t float down, I crash down hard.  Winter~ when the rain starts to fall. My life is completely torn to peaces. I am bare. Winter is the harshest of all seasons. An emotional blizzard.  Spring~ when my life starts anew. I gather myself, and often use you for support (I’m very weak at this point). My life begins to blossom.

      I work at a day camp full of little kids. You wouldn’t believe the stories I’ve heard from these kids! I’ve heard that someone could detach his head and still live “for reals”. This one kid was born with flames painted on his fingernails! It’s amazing how many kids still fall for the “detaching finger” trick. It’s interesting to think that to them, this is all so real. While to us it all seems so fake and ignorant. I’m beginning to wonder if what seems to be reality to me is as fake to someone else as those kids’ to me. What if what they believe is real is the actual reality, and what I believe is reality is the huge made up story.

      Nothing’s changed, nothing’s changed. I look about this old memory I am now re-living, and everything from the writing on the wall, to  the paint job, to the people is exactly the same (with the exception of a few oddballs). I love the constancy of this beloved place is something I know I can rely on. I love the respect I get from everyone, and the old summer friends are my continuous invitation to keep coming back. Nope, nothing’s changed.

      What you are about to read is a “Quick Write”. A “Quick Write” is an activity we did in my eighth grade English class. Our teacher gives us a topic to write about. We get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can. In this “Quick Write” the topic was My Best Friend. We were to describe our best friend, or if you didn’t have one, you could write about what your best friend would be like. That was my circumstance.  My best friend would be a great person, perfect in my eyes. He’d be easy to talk to. He’d always listen and He’d be great at giving advice. I wouldn’t be afraid to tell Him my deepest, darkest secrets; I’d know He would keep them. He would not be judgmental. My best friend would never ask why I am the way I am, or why I do the things I do; He would already know. He would be extremely intelligent. I would never have to explain myself to Him; He’d simply accept everything. He would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings, but would always praise me for the things I do right. He’d be the only one with an unconditional love for me. He would never play favorites; He’d treat everyone as equals. Above all, my best friend would be a Christian, a healthy Christian who was very close to God. He’d be my best friend.  It was not until when I read it aloud to my mother when I noticed I chose my best friend to be male. I couldn’t explain why. Then she pointed out that every time the nameless friend was mentioned, I had capitalized the pronoun. That’s pretty uncommon in the English language, unless of course you are referring to God or Jesus. Read the “Quick Write” again. Doesn’t it seem to describe God/Jesus?

      You think you’ve known yourself forever and will know yourself forever… until you change. The truth is you don’t truly know yourself. Never have, never will. For you are wearing a mask… a thousand masks. And you never really change; you just remove one mask knowing another is beneath it. Yourself is your biggest, most well kept secret of all times. The only time you can ever reveal your secret is in you dreams. In your dreams all your masks are stripped from you. You see how you truly are. But when you awake, you forget your dreams, yourself, your hidden identity. You put on your thousand masks, so just incase one falls off you can never be seen. And you step into a world of masked people. You step into a masked world.

      Have you ever felt so horrible: like a million knifes stabbing your body all at once. The pain is imbedded in you. Not only physically, but mentally too. It seeps deeper, opening every wound in you not yet completely healed. The knives penetrate through your entire body and sloe. All pain, physical and mental, becomes one thing. One ever-lasting thing. The process to heal such a great wound could take more than a lifetime. Death seems so relieving right now. But then you just freeze. You are iced. You can’t think, but thoughts are racing through your mind. You can’t speak, but you have so much to say. You can’t move, but you just can’t stay still. You don’t feel. Nothing seems real. You slip into a conscious coma. A stage of literal nothingness, with a numb pain.

      “That’s not fair!” I work with a ton of little kids, so this statement is too well known. My response is usually, “Life’s not fair.” One night after a completely “unfair” day, I thought about it. I thought about how you could explain life’s not fair. I decided to take a religious stand on this subject. I came up with this:  If life was supposed to be fair, we’d all go to hell. Do you think it’s fair that the most PERFECT man, who never sinned in his entire life, was tortured and killed for OUR sins and wrongdoings? But if life was fair, Jesus would not have died for us, therefore, we would not be saved. We would not have a chance to go to Heaven. So yes, life’s not fair, but it was never meant to be.

      Some people say, “It’s not where you are going that matters, it’s the journey on the way.” This may be true for some; however, there are those who see it through my eyes. What if you know the journey is so rough, so unbearable, and you know you just might not be able to make it through. Do you be an optimist and lie to yourself: tell yourself it will be great and easy, only to let yourself down time and time again? I don’t. That is why I believe you should live for the destination: the “Utopia” beyond the hardships. What sense dose it make to live for the harsh path? It makes much more sense to live for the tranquility that awaits you on the other side of it all. Journey~ Harsh Sharp Painful Unbearable Rough Intolerable Agonizing Excruciating Awful Insufferable Horrendous Insupportable Violent Ruthless Fierce Vicious Emotional Anguish Suffering Destination~ Utopia Tranquil Calm Serene Peaceful Relaxing Bliss Soothing Relief Perfect Soft Constant Lovely Wonderful Paradise  Which one do you want to live for: the journey or the destination?

      Death can be a scary thing. It only seems like that because we know so little about it. We don’t know when our decease will take place, or where for that matter, or what is after death, although there are many opinions. Everybody is different, so I can only speak for myself, but death to me is in fact daunting. I’m not really frightened of how I die, it doesn’t matter that much to me. I’m not apprehensive about what happens to me after death, I believe my God will take me to heaven. I’m afraid of when I will die. I’m afraid that when I die, the people who I know would never have heard what I had to tell them, especially my family. I’m afraid that I’d pass before I told them I loved them so much. I couldn’t imagine their lives after I died without having a clear conscience that I loved them. I’d think they would think of my last memory of them trying to remember if it was a positive memory. Nobody wants to be remembered pessimistically. I want them all to know that I appreciate them all so much and I love them with all my heart.

      I love to dance. I love the natural high I get from dancing. My movement is so limitless. Every emotion can be told through dance. I can’t even begin to explain the rush I get from dancing. I get so lightheaded. I don’t care what other people think. I don’t care what I look like, or what I’m doing. I become so incredibly care free. I am never free from stress anymore. I’m constantly working, and am always stressed out. I can never get a break! But when I’m dancing, I stop thinking. Everything lifts from my shoulders. I can move freely. There is absolutely nothing on my mind when I’m dancing, and I get light headed and dizzy. When I need to escape, I turn on the radio and wait for a good song to come on. Then I dance until I can hardly move anymore. Everything is forced from me. No more anger, anxiety, depression, stress, ECT. I am completely tranquil. Dance.

      People are always saying, “Just be yourself”. When you say, “I don’t know how to act in this situation”, they always say, “Just be yourself”. But what if “yourself”, I mean the way you truly are when no one is watching, it not what they wanted or expected. You are constantly rejected for “yourself”. How would anybody attain friends or a significant other?  Certainly not by being you. So according to the surrounding people, be it at home, at church, with your friends, you put on an act to satisfy their wants in a person. Like a chameleon, you change your colors, attitudes, style, personality, completely change yourself to match and blend in to your surroundings. So when people say, “Just be yourself,” think about it. They are really saying “Look, act, be… how I want you to be.”

      Have you ever had the feeling you were alone? Even though the whole world is surrounding you, they aren’t really with you at all. I was sitting next to my best friend and her boyfriend who at that time was my crush. I look down at their hands, holding each other’s hands. I look down at my hands holding nobody’s but my own. As I was walking to my next class, with my arms crossed, I saw them again. This time they were hugging. Again I look at myself to see that I was in fact hugging nobody but myself. I really shouldn’t feel so alone, but for some unknown reason I do. It is painful, being alone and all. But I know there’s someone out there for me too. Actually, I KNEW there was someone out there for me, until I met my love. I finally found him. There is nobody that could compare to him. Until fate breaks us apart, which we both know will happen soon, I’m NOT alone. For once, I’m not alone.
