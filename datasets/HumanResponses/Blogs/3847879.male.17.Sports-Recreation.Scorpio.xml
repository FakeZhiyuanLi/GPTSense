So yeh,I have good news.I just got my car back from the garage and it believe me, its off the Hinges. You wont even recognise it.I bought the car like a month ago.Saved a bit of money and got my friend to do some work on it.So check it out:  urlLink 232 23235933;:935ot1lsi">Tha Hood Ride         Hahaha.J/k.Anyways,yeh im not up to much.

      Hey Everyone,nothing has changed that much since I last posted anything,well,apart from the fact that I went to the Hospital today!!I had to get my Collar bone checked again because as most of you know,about 5 weeks ago I fractured my collar bone but only realized 3 weeks ago.Anywho,I was waiting for what seemed like forever in a well lit,vibrant room full of bored and impatient.....Patients.  Then there's the other ones,the older ladies that sit there and reminisce on the "old times" and how things were so different.And they always make me smile when they talk about supermarket prices and where the best places are to get your bargains.They always seem to know.But what makes me smile is that they probably spend an enormous amount of time in a hospital every week or at least some sort of clinic and yet,somehow they maintain their happiness.  It kinda makes you wonder bout life.I mean when you look back on your life when your their age,are you gonna be able to smile and say:"yeh im happy with the way my lifes turned out.Im glad that I spent all these years serving Jehovah.Id never change it for the world?"  You see,what im tryin to say is that,if we do our best for Jehovah and put Him FIRST in our lives,then,chances are when we're at their age and we look back (if the system hasn't ended by then),we'll be able to say:"Im Happy with the way my lifes turned out.Ive stuck by Jehovah and Hes stuck by me,and I dont regret a single day spent in His service"!Its just a thought to keep in mind,we might as well use our youth while we still have it rather than be regretting it for the rest of our lives.  Well that's all I got for yas.Night night.Lata-Lv Paul

      Ok,I have to apologise for being lax with adding things to my Blog.Anyways,I will endevour to update it everyday starting from today.Wednesday might be a tough day though because I gotta go to the Hospital.But I will try my best.  Anyways,I went to a convention with Sinbad and I got to see all my friends that I havn't seen for the past year.It was really nice to see them all again and to see them all doin so well in the truth.It encouraged me alot.It also kinda took the focus off the things that I've been worrying about lately.It made me think of how all the brothers have problems they have to deal with and yet they put them all aside and make sure they have their priorites right.......being at the convention.It was nice to see so many young people like myself taking a stand for the truth.So any young ones out there that are struggling at the moment,just remember that theres kids all throughout the association of brothers suffering the same.Keep up the good work I tells ya!!!!  Anywho,thats all the wisdom I gots for you today.Smell yall lata-   P Man

      So, I guess Im kind of copying the girls idea but lets face it, it was pretty smart. Anywho,yeh I know the description makes me sound like a Shrink but Im not looking for sleezy stories or the worlds biggest problems, I just want to add a little humour to all of our lives and the problems that fill them.So, hope you like it and feel free to voice your opinion.  Anyways, moving swiftly on...i have a few good ones coming up so make sure you get to see 'em. Wait until you hear the song I've chosen for the website. You will undoubtedly pee your pants AKA trousers (for all the Irish peeps)!  Ok, well im gonna make like my pants and SPLIT.Catch Yall lata,  Lv P-Man

           Yeh,so its only one more month til' the P-Unit Kru you see above is reunited.Isnt that exciting? Yes,I know. It's been sad days since the lads left for the great open spaces of America but me and Sinbad only have to endure 2-4 more weeks of this turmoil without our buddies and then we'll be re-united, back to our old childish selves.Cant wait for it.
