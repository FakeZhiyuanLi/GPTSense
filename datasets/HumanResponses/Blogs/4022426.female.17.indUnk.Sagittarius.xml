      this past week has been so amazing! GOD was working through people in amazing ways. we built a deckwe stairs up to it, fixed up the landscaping in the front, and made stairs on the hill to the back of the house for an older woman. it looks so nice now. she was so great. she kept bringing us drinks and snacks and was so greatful.   i got to help build the deck. we were nailing the boards down and one was warpt. so i held the board in place with my foot and jlo (jon long) nailed it. he missed the nail and almost hit my foot. i was kinda shaken. i was walking back to the other side of the deck along a couple of boards stacked across the deck. the boards slipped and i went with them. i fell and hit my knees. my right knee was fine but my left knee is now pretty colors and swolen.   so i got to work w/ my youth pastor, pj, and a guy my youth group, jr, and a half of a group from canada, a couple other guys,  and adults, tom jim and eric. julie, linda, gillian( orignially from irealnd), jlo, daniel, and javier(orignially from mexico). really happy pj and jr were there i got to know them a whole lot better. and i did want to strangle jr many a time but it's all grave. julie is so funny. she loved to take out the roots w/ the hachet. she's a skinny girl and these where big roots and she'd just go at 'em. the few times she could get em we'd get jr and he'd get em in one or two wacks. linda is such a sweetie and so is gillian. jlo is awesome. he wrote a song called deodorant time. it's funny. when i heard it i was dying. javier is cool but he is such a flirt. still luv him though. also got to know the rest of their group. nicole, angelica(orignially from italy), paul, sara, jason(orignially from jersey), and alex. sara nicole and angelica are sweethearts. jason is great. alex is a  crazy but i guess he's ur typical 15 yr old boy. paul is an awesome guy. i loved all the time i got to spend w/ them. it was such a blessing to meet them. i'm definately already planning to go up and visit them. they are some of the coolest people ever.

      Sunday I finally got home around nine. It's starting to dawn on me that Luke is really leaving. I can't believe it. it's really upsetting. What's so weird is that I haven't even known him for a year. I met him last september but it feels like i've known him for years. I'm going to miss him so much.  I'm so struggling. I got asked to do another youth group thang in the up coming school year. There is no way I can take on something else. I don't even know exactly capable of doing what I've already committed myself to. Someone needs to help me to stop saying yes to everyone. lol.You would probably never think it but I really do want to please most people. And I have such a hard time telling people no. I don't want to dissapoint them. It's something I really need to start working at.  So I spent most of wednesday "saving" Lyd from Joey. Except the only problem was Joey wasn't around. lol. We went to see Napoleon Dynamite (amazingly a good movie). Joey wasn't around to come see that. Went back to Lyd's, Joey went to the Adam's house. I tried but I didn't really have much to do. And I have to give a big thanx to Dan for picking me up.  You are the bestest homie ever... but you're still stupid. lol.  Yea so I was talking to Lyd and Beth wednesday. We talking about how much everyone has changed this summer. At the time I said I haven't changed but I'm now wondering if I have. I don't know. If I have changed I hope it's for the better. If nothing else I've learned much about myself. I know I have made some amazing friends and improved on friendships. Now I know I have awesome people I can count on.   Oh My Gosh!!!! NO MORE COMMON GROUND!!!!! I'm a junkie! How am I suppose to get through this last year with out it? This is so flipping uncool. What the crap is that all about? Now I have no reason to hang at Lyd's every other weekend. This is so flipping uncool!!!!  Ok now that I've gotten that out. Maybe this is a good thang. it's one less thing on my calender for next year. It's more free time. It's more time I spend working on my relationship w God which is my one major goal for this upcoming year. Forget college, senior year, passing. I just want to improve my relationship my God and Savior. And along with that I'm going to try (again) to have a positive attitude and out look on yhis up coming year. Like with Ashley playing volleyball. Maybe I'll learn something about myself by having her invade my sport. Ok so I'm sorry I had to put all my rantings up. Now i'm done.   so my sisters got back from camp today. i miss the silence.  as soon as i got home from my reunion, my sisters started freaking. they were so excited to see my mom and me. when lexi when to get my present, she started spazing because she couldn't find it. that's when i started to miss the silence. It was a mess. Anyway they're back and life is back to normal.   so i went to that reunion today. it was flipping awful for a while. it didn't get good until a bunch of people left and wee-man got there. i didn't want to be there so much i called lyd and talked with her for 23 minutes. lol i think frodo was the only one who realized i was gone. generally they are just a bunch of flithy kids. their favorite topic is sex. i found out that one of the guys came out of the closet after the trip. i totally felt like grace from will and grace. he was probably the most attractive guy on the trip and he's a flamer. on top of it all, some of the people i wanted to see the most didn't even come. it was pretty much a complete waste of my day. i'm really irked because i could have gone to see steve play but i was at the stupid reunion.   the only positive thinf that happend was that i realized how far i have come in the past year. i have matured as a person so much. i was shocked to see how much no one esle had really changed. i thank God for helping me grow up. i changed a lot last summer but i changed even more over this past year. God has turned me into a person i canbe proud and hopefully in most case HE can be proud of. i realize how blessed i am to have Him in my life when i see these people so lost.
