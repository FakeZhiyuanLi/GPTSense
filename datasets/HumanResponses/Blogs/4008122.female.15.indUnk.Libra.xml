       " True friends are like diamonds presious and rare, false friends are like autum leaves found every where."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Nick Rice     &nbsp;   I have many close friends who are in some type of military branch. I dont know what i would do if I ever found out that something happened to them. So Im asking you to please say a little prayer for them or just to keep them in your heart. It would mean a lot to me if you would and i bet it would mean the world to them. Thank you for your time and remember to keep a soldier in you heart.
