      Yes, yesterday we celebrated our 14th wedding anniversary.  Seems like a double 7 year itch. 14 is such a nothing year - stuck in the mid adolescence of marriage. The husband is definitely going through his own wild adolescence right now, maybe it's about time I started my own.  What would be my first move? hmmm - already have the pimples (mixed with gray hair and wrinkles). I could steal a car, make out wildly with equally pimply boys, shop lift, wear inappropriate amounts of makeup and clothes, talk on the phone for hours, runaway from home.  Now that is a good idea! I would love to run away from home.  But alas, I cannot in light of the obligations of children, laundry and husband.  In lieu of running away from home, I would like to be called Esther. I think I am ready to devote myself to Madonna/Esther if not to Kabbala itself. I'm ready.  Had a heap of prime rib last night with the big cheeses of my small little universe.  Wore cleavage and an octopus brooch and felt like a hussy looking like a grownup.  I figured I had a half a chance of being the best looking woman at my table - but not sure I actually won that competition.  Really really tried to make conversation with my host who sat on my left and regaled me with tales of Janis Joplin, Maria Shriver, Bela Lugosi, Jimmy Carter and Marion Jones. Yes, you know who I am talking about. My job was to utter in flabbergasted tones: "Oh to pack that much life into those few years, wow wow wow." I think I held up my end pretty well. You can take the syncophant out of Connecticut but you can't take the syncophant out of California. What?

      I am really in a bad mood. My life is all about waiting for star to arrive.  I can't stand it anymore.

      Well, yesterday passed without too much disaster. The trip to the Grossman factory was a bit terrifying - a whole lot of creating stickers for the glory of god stuff - and our tour group was more like the kind of group you would imagine making the pilgrimage to Lourdes.  Just another fun day in Petaluma. But we did get a whole lot of free stickers and learned the fascinating process of creating lacy stickers with lasers. The kids seemed to have fun and a trip to the gift store is never a bad idea.  I feigned sleep with my youngest to avoid the dinner party guest.  A terrible sin? I think not - there is only so much socialing I can take with a relative stranger. I made the man dinner - or least Whole Foods did - what more must I do to prove myself human?  Finally, as I left Starbucks with my Venti Latte this morning, I decided I needed more friends. Then I realized I had four friends: Leissa, Lisa, Tracey and Pam - and that was pretty good. What positive thinking? Quel bizarre.  Maybe that extra dose of antidepressant is finally kicking in.

      The first day of summer vacation and the bar has already been set very low. After a few scream sessions with the kids, Mabel wrote Virgil a love letter with the immortal words: "You smell like carrots that a pig spit out", then Virgil tried to choke Mabel while she was wandering around the house stuck in a sleeping bag and cosmo ate his 900th frozen pancake, I realized it might be a good idea to raise the dose of my antidepressant for at least the next few months.  The good news is we managed to squeeze into a 100pm tour of Mrs. Grossman's sticker factory today! Hooray!  It's going to be a long hot summer.
