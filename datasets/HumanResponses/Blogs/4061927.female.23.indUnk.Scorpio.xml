        Its funny how I put things off up until now.... I wish I had practice the art of saving a long damn time ago.... Here I am now out of school...Back at home ( thankful that I could come back home) with no space... I mean REALLY no space... I have suit cases they are potential firehazards in the furnace room I because all that crap cant fit in my closet or the room at all... I am constantly bumping something&nbsp; and that's to say the least. Space is VERY necessary for the life of a 23 young woman.... How can I be organized in a space fit for a mess. All of this say exclaim why in the hell didnt I do what I KNEW I  should  and   Could   have been doing a long damn time ago.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I am now tweeking because I am ready to go--- I cant.&nbsp; I mean I could but It would be in my best interest... Hmmm best interest... I obviously didnt gave a rats a%! about that earlier.....&nbsp;&nbsp; well I can do now is do what I do.... Imean making a decent salary for my age is cool but you wouldn't know by the TAX CUT.... I mean DAYUM can I get a tax BREAK. geez.... You think you are going to be ballin but you really come out smallin.   This real life stuff is something I aint ready to get used to!

         All my life I have had the luxuries of life... this I am&nbsp;now learning at the age of 23.&nbsp; Here I thought some of my other friends and it had great only to know I had it good.... That theory is still up for discussion.&nbsp; During my matriculation at Bennett College, I wondered what was to become of my life..... Never did&nbsp;I expect to be working for the dentist from hell--- in the hole of hell.... I am glad to have moved on to BIGGER and&nbsp;BETTER things like screaming on the man who just cut me off on 267, &nbsp;or maybe honking at the girl picking her nose on 66.... or maybe catching hell for being late after sitting in traffic --only to get here to kiss someone 's &nbsp;ass. Wow!&nbsp; Is this really the real world?&nbsp; Apparently so... and its just getting started... I am trying to act the best interest of my performance rating since it is doomed, since I am late and not cuss the "causcasian persuasion" out.... which you know would be nothing short of a breath of fresh air for me...      What would a good negress do???????...   Keep it cute&nbsp;I presume.... which is what I will attempt to do.....

          Thief - 1. One who steals; one who commits theft or larceny. See       Theft      .         This is the first of many topics that I will linger the gloomy cloud over today. Everyone knows of or have known a thief that has affected them in some way shape or form. My thief as of today is--- well in order to be clandestine will remain nameless. We will address  THEM  as the  THIEVES.         I do not appreciate when people talk down to me as if I just dropped out of Eliott Jr. High school at the age of 12 in grade 6. Dont EVEN try to play me! See thats the thing that blows me about people... they assume that for whatever color that you are, or whatever variable they want to draw their so called "scientific hypothesis-- follwed by their counterfactual,  and usually short-sighted conclusion" about what the hell is really going on. This is how people get uckfed in the workplace forreal. DO not underestimate a black women intelligence. She just might kirk the hell on you-- and then dare your ass to say something. See, this brings us to the noun that I am speaking of...  THEFT.  The thief would have just robbed you of your joy as you sit at you PC and entertain yourself via your CD player with Anthony Hamilton.... Why don't people get the message that I am trying to remain clam on a day when there is a continual fire and anti- terror alarm going off that is nearly sends my ass into cardiac arrest. Hence, this blog.... My joy is already being tampered with by things that I cannot control and yet you (THIEVES) want to add to the isht???? Actually no wait that was not a question. .! People are coming to me with the dumbest things.... I see right now that as you get older just go ahead and add a fat ass helping of stress on the side. . Trust me no need to pull out your wallet -- it pays for itself. I swear I can Not understand that when people have a ucking problem they have to email every damn body and cc everybody else!!!! Do something.! Get a task... These THIEVES better learn how to talk to me before they get knocked down. Just because you don't look like me gives you no right to irk the hell out of me for the small stuff... Do you see this is what I mean when I say these people will send me str8 into racism... And I am not even racist! All I am saying is approach me like an adult and show me some respect... I am getting huffy and puffy so I am gonna roll.          I hope that this is somewhat understood by others and just soley just for my personal benefit.      Lesson to be learned: Try not to let other steal your joy....... Thieves will always be in your presence even if they are dormant at the time.... so watch out.....
