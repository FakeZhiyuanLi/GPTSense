        OKay, this is my first ACTUAL time doing something like this and i'm going to follow through wit it. This is going to be my Jounal and all that crap.. and i'm going to start a book. Like a miniture novel or something. So yeah. ANYHOE My summer has been going great. I have the coolest beer belly and i love it. Almost every night i go out and party wit my friends and everything is ALMOST perfect. There is still that something that i'm missing.. u wanna know what it is?.. a GIRLFRIEND.i havent had one for a long time, and i think its time to have one again. I mean what guy goes around chillin witout a girl for a long time?..NOT ME. I'm too insecure. I need a girl i need someone there for me someone i can depend on and all that. I thought i found her. I did for about 8 months and then something went wrong and it ended. Ever since then i havent been able to recover. They say ur first REAL love is the one you can never forget..Well, its true. I cant forget her.  ANYHOE X2  -GIRLS-what are the TRUE purposes for girls? The text book definition for GIRL is female servant or employee. i dont see where all that happened to go bad..? ahah but u gotta love girls think about it fellas what would we do without them?. I for one would DIE i need them, there's nothing better then a girl's touch. what am i TALKING ABOUT?... I'M GOING TO BED. GOOD NIIIIGGHHTT EVERYONE

         Well, you can say that today was just your average day. Today i woke up EXTRA early cause SOMEONE called me at like 10 and i was kinda upset but i got over it. When i woke up i went downstairs and got something to drink then went back up stairs and went back to sleep, it was nice. Later on in my day i went to one of my friend's house and chilled and watched a sweet chick fight between his sister and his cousin. WOW i think thats the nicest girl fight i've seen all summer. But chyea.                             ANYHOE     I'm kinda bummed out. I really liked this girl right, and well, she didnt really feel me the way i felt her. And she said she did and mer mer mer but deep inside her i knew that she wasnt liken me like that so i decided to lay low wit her for a while and maybe she'll get back to herself and start liking me again that way we can be happy again. Well it's been like 4 days since we last spoke and i'm getting kinda worried. But it's like i  dont wanna talk to her and make her think that i wanna talk to her, i do, but i just dont wanna go back to her if its not my fault. I dont know. i really like her but i dont wanna be the one that has to talk. But Chyeah thats my wonderful thinking. Its been killin me like a BURNING FIREd
