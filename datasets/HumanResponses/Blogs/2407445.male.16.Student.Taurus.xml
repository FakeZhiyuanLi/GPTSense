In the starting, I always let him go first, so as usual, the first turn, I overtake him again(or is it the second turn??) Than, bah bah bah, I won....than the best thing is, I level up!!W00t! Nice!!Than arh, Nicholas ask me can let him win or not, he say he will use his credits, I think for a while than say ok lor....I also say I change cars to GC8 first, Wahlao...the worst part is this liao....give him 500m lead before I go sia....in the end, I almost overtake him, I must let go my petal in order not to overtake him sia...ppl see me do that arh, will call me siao sia....anyway, after that Tux came, and Nicholas ask Tux to help him defeat some of the computers in the story mode, I was like, wtf?? Nicholas, why cant you do it yourself??? Oh well, than Taka came, at first I do not know who he is, this is what he say:  Taka: So what car you want me to use? Me: huh, who are you? Taka: I am Taka Me: oh Taka: what car you want me to use? Me: Anything lor Taka: No, I must let you choose, cos you are here for Trial Me: ok lor...let me think...how about RX-8? Taka: ok  and so, we started to race, I choose the track randomly cos i feel random is the best way to choose, it chose Iro, wth Iro??I was thinking, I sure lose one...in the starting arh, wah my fc and his rx-8(it was a stock car) same speed, but in the end I overtake him, cos of the first turn, than bah bah bah, he overtake me in the jumping part, omg I miss the jump???Than I try to overtake him in the next turn, but it fail, cos he also jump....in the end, he stop to let me pass the finishing line, i was like, wtf? I should lose....I ask why,he say he dont want to waste my credits, such a nice guy huh??Next race he chose akagi downhill, wet..cos in the forum I ask him to choose akagi one what...he let me go 200m lead before he start....he was catching up!!wah, he really pro...but in the end I won, cos i think he got bang the wall or something, I won by only around 70m i think??Pro right that Taka??  Taka: ok I will tell uncle sad about you Me: Er...ok  that wai seng came....we told wai seng to wait for his turn slowly, me and nicholas go eat first...bah bah bah, nicholas treat me to cheese fries, he is a good 'brother' right??Than we went to zone x, see got two noobs there playing...I advise him to change view, he dont want, oh well, feel like challange him to a race, but better save the money for something else ya??We went back to funland, saw wai seng playing liao...he say he cant beat that shomaru first guy, ask me to help, I say ok lor...I help him lor...in the end I overtake the computer and won for wai seng lor...dunno what I do in my last life, need to help my friends beat the computer one(I hate myself for being the only pro in Initial D, and not my friends that are pro, and I am not talking about Aegis and Tux)Oh well, in the end we went home....wow I have type a lot today...hehe, I keep this up, and your eyes will go round and round,lolx

       Opening Song Lyrics:  In your dreams, magical thoughts...  All things are real unless you dream they're not.  In your dreams, love is the plot carried on wings of hope.  Each of our souls intertwine, when we do.  Instantly we see it the time to grow and be it when everything is pinned on a hope.  Let rise the dreams of your heart, that innocent youth careless and kind.  Free to roam the breeze in love only when two brilliantly shine as one...   Boat Song Lyrics:  Wishing on a dream that seems far off Hoping it will come today.  Into the starlit night, Foolish dreamers turn their gaze, Waiting on a shooting star.  But, what if that star is not to come? Will their dreams fade to nothing? When the horizon darkens most, We all need to believe there is hope.  Is an angel watching closely over me? Can there be a guiding light I've yet to see? I know my heart should guide me, but, There's a hole within my soul.  What will fill this emptiness inside of me? Am I to be satisfied without knowing?  I wish then for a chance to see, Now all I need,   Is my star to come...  PS: My blog is no longer playing Dogfight..instead, it is playing Lunar: The Silver Star Story Complete Opening Song, enjoy! ^^V

      kk, here is the song that is playing in my blog...the lyrics!!!   Eternal Blue Theme  "A legend of old. A story forgotten. The memories, of true love Stolen from time.  A darkened romance. Pray hard to remember. A doorway to the heart Beckons your mind!  And now, a corner of night, can lift the weight from you. It's in your hands. If just you understand.  A destiny lost. A bond that's been broken. The memories, of a time That slipped away.  Just open your mind The way lies before you. A doorway to the heart You seek to find.  Love can change the key you hold Into a gilded chance. So tear a memory from your mind And make it so real.  {Chorus 1}  Blue star above me, Your mystic shimmer tells of love, I should know. Whisper your secret. To soothe my doubt and calm my fear.  Blue star above me, When shadows lengthen and the dark Looms ever closer, Turn on your shine and hold me near.  {Bridge}  When the comet pulls the bow, The stars begin their dance.  The time when destiny and hope Will give birth again.  {Chorus 2}  Then if it's to be, I'll find a glimmer of the life, I should know.  Only that moment Can show me what I hold so dear.  Until that moment, I'll find some comfort in a love Within my slumber Turn on your charm and hold me near.  {Repeat Chorus 1}"     urlLink Click here to listen to Lunar 2 Battle Theme     urlLink Click here to listen to Luna BoatSong     urlLink Click here to listen Lunar Opening Theme

      Lucia's Theme  "When I was alone as one, My eyes were as blind, I know. Sky brilliant with blue elegance, I couldn't behold.  When I was alone as one, My heart was as ice, so cold. Wind whispering sweet melodies, I could not behold.  Sight to my eyes, And warmth to my heart, Your love has been such to me.  Pull closer now, And strengthen my leaning, Toward love to heal all my wounds.  {Chorus}  When our hearts both beat in time, There's magic in your smile, It seems there's nothing we can't do.  And within your warm embrace, My heart will find a place, Even from afar, Our love forever shall be, destiny.  {Bridge}  When I was alone as one, My eyes were as blind, I know. Sky brilliant with blue elegance, I couldn't behold.  When I was alone as one, My heart was as ice, so cold. Wind whispering sweet melodies, I could not behold.  Sight to my eyes, And warmth to my heart, Your love has been such to me.  Pull closer now, And strengthen my leaning, Toward love to heal all my wounds.  {Chorus}  When our hearts both beat in time, There's magic in your smile, It seems there's nothing we can't do.
