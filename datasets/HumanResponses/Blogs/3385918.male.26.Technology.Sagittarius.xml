      This is a picture of Gloriham and Fredz. I haven't talked to Gloriham in a while, but she is a very nice and funny person who loves to laugh and have fun. At school, I would always be trying my best to do some silly thing to make her crack up. She has a very nice smile too.   Fredz (A.K.A. Madam X) is my internet best friend cause I see and / or talk to him almost every single day on MSN. I would say that it's one of my oldest and dearest friendships. =;-D         urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      (I know you liked this very much, even taught that now that I look back on it I have no idea what it means. Hahaha I'm pretty sure I can figure it out, but I'm too lazy right now to do it. My mind is tiered. It's to early a Saturday to be thinking. Gonna go watch some cartoons. Bye)   Pink oranges litter my mind's eye, slowly growing deeply behind. Lost in my sexy design, that of my iron will, only love stands between me... and my happiness.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      I was talking to a friend of mine the other day. We were talking about her work as an editor for a local independent magazine when the conversation turned to Iraq and, inadvertently, to Nicholas Berg. She often enjoys talking about this cause she has always wanted to freelance as a journalist.   As all of you may already know, Nicholas Berg was a U.S. businessman that was decapitated by members of Saddam Hussein's Fedayeen paramilitary organization. The whole incident was video taped and found it's way into the net.  When I told her about the video, she expressed interest in watching it. She told me that it's just our of curiosity (something that she claims is a characteristic of a good reporter). I told her that she could download it from Kazaa if she wished. To which she asked me to download it for her and send it through the internet so she could watch it.   Now, let me stop here and make something clear. I'm not into watching people get tortured or killed. Once a friend of mine asked me to watch Faces of Death with him. I said no. He was stunned. He could not believe that someone like me who is into gory horror movies would back out at the opportunity to see a real life gory death. I answered that there is a big difference between fiction and reality. In fact, I often prefer fiction cause it's easier to digest than reality.  I've had hundred of opportunities to download these types of video. I recall once that in the office there was this group of people huddling around a laptop, watching something. I asked what it was they were watching. It was the video where Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is murdered. I refused to watch it. Mostly because I had seen Daniel Pearl several times on TV and the thought of watching a real person die in a gruesome way made me sick to my stomach.   Still, I ended up downloading the Nicholas Berg video for my friend, knowing that I would most certainly end up watching it myself. Which, afterward, made me think at who stupid I was to let my curiosity get the best of me after I had been so stern before about watching these types of videos. Not sure why this video compelled me into watching it, but I did.   Once the video downloaded, I immediately played it and I watched as Nicholas Berg was slaughtered like poultry. This word might seen in poor taste, but that's what it seemed to me. To his killers, he wasn't human. Just a piece of meat to be sliced without mercy. Heck, the way the decapitated him looked like the had done at hundreds of times and one more really didn't make much difference.   Now, I wasn't too shocked, cause I already had a feeling of what to expect and, do to the blurriness of the video, the gore didn't mentally scar me. It did made me think and the more I taught, the more disturbing ideas crossed my mind.   Did he know he was going to die? How long did his agony last until he died? Was his mind conscious as his head was severed and held toward the lens of a camera? His family...   "My father is Jewish. My mother is Jewish. I'm Jewish."   Words that echo into oblivion can never be forgotten.   I sent the video to my friend, but she didn't receive it cause her computer disconnected from the internet due to some odd error. I actually felt stupid. That made me decide to call up my best friend J.C. on the phone. Didn't get much comfort cause she was pissed about something and didn't want to talk. I tried to tell her about Nicholas Berg, but she said that if it had to with Iraq she wasn't interested cause she had other things to worry about than that. We ended up talking about something totally silly and trivial that night, which helped calm my nerves. That is until we got into a stupid argument about something that right now I can't remember.   The next day I talked to my editor friend. She at her work, editing a story that had her in a bad mood due to some very simple and avoidable spelling mistakes (or so she told me). I asked if she wanted me to send her the video later and she said not to worry cause she saw it in the morning when a fellow worker played it on one of the PCs.  She seemed unaffected about the whole think. Like she just saw a clip from the new Friday The 13th movie, went "yuck" and life went on.   Later that day, CNN mentioned that there was this incident involving high school students that were caught watching the video at school. The news suggested that the teachers knew that the video was being played and, probably, took part in the viewing. Wouldn't surprise me.   The report mentioned something that made me think. Someone mentioned that the video was used to teach the children a lesson. Maybe teach the children about the struggle that is going on right now in Iraq. Or maybe, just to show them that there is real evil in the world. Either way, it's pretty sick, but I guess I can relate. When I was a kid, I was taught that good always triumph over evil. No Nicholas Berg to teach us otherwise back then.  The next report talked about how horrified the parents of Nicholas Berg felt when they learned that the death of their son had now joined the ranks of Paris Hilton, Janet Jackson  and Pamela Anderson as novelties to be downloaded from the net. Must be hard for a parent that has lost a son in such a horrible way to be able to comprehend something like that. Like loosing your son over and over again.   I also thought that maybe, in some weird way, by watching the video we were making ourselves accomplices in the murder of Nicholas Berg. Watching. We are the camera. We watched him die and did nothing but enjoy the show. And, of course, this is what the murders wanted. Their message was successfully transmitted.   With all these thoughts in my head, I got a call from J.C. who sounded pretty excited. She asked me if I knew about Nicholas Berg. I said yes and confided in her that I had downloaded and seen the video of his demise. She scold me. Asked why did I tell her and I replied: "I tried, dumbass, but you didn't want to talk about Iraq and shit!" She laughed and apologized. Then she told me, almost excited, that she had just downloaded the video from the web.

      Today I haven't been able to post anything cause my boss changed my internet explorer settings so that I would not work and left me a note saying that I should not change it back. She also said in the note that since that other PC was running on a clients network, I was not aloud to surf the net there. Which is funny because all my coworkers still have access to the net through there, plus most of the viruses that leak into the net are usually because of our clients. Now, to make things more interesting, I'm one of the guys who gets called in to clean viruses when we get infected in out normal company network.   If that wasn't enough, the PC next to me is connected to my company's network, where I can surf the net. So, now I have to get up, move away from my work and sit down in another PC so surf the net. You might think that what I should do is work and not surf the net, right? I ask you, how am I supposed to download drivers and patches or receive company emails if I don't have access to the net? Didn't think about that, huh? Well, its okay, neither did my boss.  But I'm not worried cause I disabled the internet on my coworkers PC's too. Why should I be the only one fucked? She said so herself. She doesn't want virus getting into the clients network. I'm just helping her out. ;)  Also, I installed Opera in the PC and hid every shortcut, reference to the program and pointer to the application. Heck, I even modified the uninstall name so nobody can find it in the Add/Remove Control Panel. So, now I'm the only one that has access to the internet through the client's network. Shhhhhhhhh !!! Don't tell anyone, ok?  Ain't I a stinker!  Sailor Ecchi

      (Here is a little something I wrote for my dear old friend, the Madam X. It was for a class or something like that. The son of a… gun ended up never using it. Go figure. So here I lay claim to it. Hope you like it.)  Freedom By Sailor Ecchi (ehudders@coqui.net) - December 20, 2003   Running toward the crystal blue water, my body burns scorching hot. Blazing sand feels like hurdles, making me loose track of my one, true goal. To return to that place which is more home to me, than home. My second home, my desire, the warm ocean water.   I see it, near me, yet far away. The ocean calls, so I reach for it. Grasping wildly, always running toward it, but never reaching it. Too many walls, too many roads. They stop me. Responsibility, time, words… My job. My life. My wife and kids. Me, myself and the brick house that is no more real that the payments I make on it. Money, power, greed… Two suits and a tie. Coffee in the morning. Madness flows, smashing against me, pulling me back, away from the waves.   I suffocate, slowly, near the edge. Fall on my knees and beg, but my strength is gone. My mind shattered, no escape, but I run still. I run cause I rather swim. Swim away. Swim away from sorrow and fear.     Finally, a choice is made and the tied rumbles. I hear it. Oh, Lord, how I hear it. It’s music, which I wish I could sing to the world, but the medley is silent to busy ears. It rings out eternally, so loud that in beckons like a beacon in the night. The fish swim toward it. The fishermen look on; they smile at it. If it’s so loud, that I can’t escape from it, then why does the world ignore it?  And at the end of my trek, where even my soul is broken and torn, I reach the water even before I feel the cool of freedom and the sensation of euphoria of homecoming. I soar in, no fear. There is nothing there to hurt me. It’s where I belong, so I jump into the crashing waves and become one with it at last.   I become a shark, with remoras on my side. The unruly current pulls me away, bounding me. There is a rush and I panic. The waves become cruel and violent, driving me further from the coast. Deeper, falling, my body turns cold, drifting in the undercurrent.    I look back and I wonder where my dreams take me, but I know the answer. They take me away, farther. Fear grips me, but only because the shore calls my name and I know that my trek is almost over. Close my eyes, soak in the wonders of this moment and breath deeply under the weight of my own release. This is my moment and, for an instant, I sink and the voice calling me back becomes muffled and distant. Still, my heart hears it and I struggle back, fighting the currents, going against reason…  My swim back is quick, to say the least. As I rise up and step unto the unkind beach, the water waves me goodbye. Feeling out of breath, I look onto the horizon and cry. Tomorrow I won’t be here. It will be a while till I return, if ever I’m allowed to return.   Today I take small breaths and try to remain calm. Looking around, I see people that want to run and swim, but move as adrift with the current that is so artificial and unreal as the forces that rule over them. Again I wish I could sing unto them the call of the ocean, but I know that it’s not for me to guide them, but to pray that they, in time, hear for themselves. Hear the truth that is spoken. That same truth that I learned and cherished. The only real truth that can be felt when the walls crash down and you look up and see, not sky, but the towering giants that imprison us in a harsh reality. This truth is that I rather drown than live without air.

      The World Sucks, Let Me Off   The world draws closer on me, Raping, braking, killing… Only wish to drive away the pain, leave, run, flee… It’s all the same. No escape, darkness falls and I sick into despair.  Dead to the world, let me live. Dreaming, sleeping, gasping… No air in these lungs would only say that which I can only scream out.    Let me be, let me be. Let me die, drop from your grasp, even for a moment. Let me not feel, let me not cry,  Let me just hate, and brood.  I will sink away, no worries.   Just forget that the rain of blood, like tears, flow from my eyes. Like a river of pain inside me.  Your cause, your victory. So I ask, and I ask this of the world…  Let me be, let me be. Let me die, drop from your grasp, even for a moment. Let me not feel, let me not cry,  Let me just hate, and brood.  I will sink away, no worries.    And so my words become nothing, But I am still here, fading. Wish I could disappear, reappear… Someplace else, live, love… Be one and know no one, except he who has what I look for… Acceptance, the key master to my loneliness.

      The day before yesterday I was buying some groceries at CostCo when I came across tow books that where half off and looked very interesting. One was "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward and the other was "Against all Enemies". I had not bough mom a gift for mother's day. Now, don't call me a bad son just yet. On that day I took her to the movies and out to eat to an expensive restaurant. Still, I wanted to get her something else. So, when I saw those books I remembered my mom saying a while back that she was very interested in reading them. Couldn't decide which one to buy, so I took them both.   Yesterday, I stopped by my mom's house during my lunch break and after I took to Señorial Plaza Mall the two defective DVDs I bought the other week (which, btw, the replacement disks they gave me are working fine, but I haven't had the chance to completely test them out). She was thrilled at the gift. That made me very happy. =;-D  She told me that she was going to read them after the finished reading the book she is currently on. It's called "Mayada" by Jean Sasson. Mom gave me an overview of this book and I must say that it sounds very interesting. The book is about the horrors of Saddam Husein's reign of terror in Iraq as seen through the eyes of an Iraqi woman who is subject to a whole mess of tortures and humiliations.   I told my mom to lend me the book after she finishes it. I also asked her to lend me the book "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore. Been told that it's a great. She didn't have it on hand, so she will look for it and give it to me another day.  Last two books I've read are "Black Hawk Down" (great book, better than the movie, even taught I love that movie !!!) and the fifth Harry Potter book (also a good book, but the fourth one is still the best).

      La Canción de un Amanecer  Deseo entregar tesoros al aire, para que los tristes las recojan y digan:  “Ese amor que ella trae, sin condiciones, llena la abundancia”.  Escuchare y celebrare, pero me estremeceré al ver un atardecer donde sienta...  “Le daré a todo el que pida. Hay mucho que dar, pero no al glotón, sino al triste y amargo”.  Así llamara y escuchare respuestas. Aquellas voces de celos y repugna. De incomprensión y misterio.  “No des el amor, que no te daríamos. No sueltes las lagrimas, que nos ahogarían. No sangres en vano, que el río esta seco”.  A lo cual cantare en el amanecer de mi nueva vida; Seré feliz y satisfecha con la sonrisa que he dado. Aquella que doy a cambio de mi angustia será bien gastada en los brazos de la miseria.   Sailor Ecchi ehudders@coqui.net

      Yesterday I had a visit from one of my long time university friends, Ivania Zayas. Ivania is a very talented local musician that is working the independent scene. She has played several concerts and has actually put out a music CD that sold pretty well at the local Borders.   It's been a long while since we last talked, especially about one of our favorite subjects: filmmaking. Last time we talked, me mentioned making a short film for the San Juan Cinemafest. This festival usually takes place between September and November.   We talked a lot about this and we will be getting together during the week to continue planning and make contact with several of our filmmaking friends to help us with the project.  I have always taught that independent filmmakers should pull together, given that we all have the same goals, even taught we often differ in the way we want to go about and reach those goals. Different points of view often pulls people away from each other, instead of bringing them closer. Also, there is this big wall called ego that often makes collaboration impossible.  Yesterday was very positive and I hope it will open the door to a good collaboration that will bear fruit. I will keep you posted on this. Wish us luck !!!   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      Hey, second post of the day !!! Weeeeee !!! I guess I'm getting the hang of this. Pretty cool.   Anyway, wanted to share some more info on stuff that has been happening during the day. Went to Collector World at the Señorial Plaza Mall during my lunch hour. I had bought from them two DVD-Rs of shows that I haven't seen since I was a child. The purchase was made last week. I returned cause both DVDs were defective. Didn't run right.   I am a big DVD fan and have like five o six DVD players and DVD-Roms. I tested each DVD in every DVD player I could get my hands on. The DVDs only played correctly in one of the players.   The people at Collector World were very surprised when they told me to test the DVDs in another player and I gave them the names of all the players I had tested the DVDs in.  They kindly agreed to get me replacement copies, which I picked up today but haven't tested yet. Now, I'll let you in on something. I recopied both DVDs into new DVD-Rs and the things worked okay, even taught one of the films had a very noticeable error after the credits. The real problem I believe was that maybe the actual DVD-R used to make these was of an inferior quality. I will have to see how good these replacement DVDs turned out. I examined the data side and the texture color seems different from the others. They could be from another brand of blank DVDs. I hope so. These two DVDs contain something that to me is very important.  One DVD is for the old Starvengers movie in spanish. In case you don't know, around 1980 there was this show called Force Five. This show was actually five "giant robot" anime series that were edited and dubbed for the American market. These shows, produced by Jim Terry Productions, had a spin off movie that was basically a summary of the entire series. Usually 100 to 120 minutes, they were like the best moments reduced into a movie. And they were pretty good. My favorite of these movies were Grandizer and, of course, Starvengers. All five movies, plus the original english series, are very hard to find. That is, unless you visiting eBay at least twice a day looking for these items. Of course, by doing this you can get these movies in english, but not in spanish. So I was pretty lucky to find this version, even taught it was a digitalized version of a very bad VHS copy of the movie. Still choosers can't beggars. The spanish audio was very good, so I can't complain (unless this replacement DVD also has errors).   The other DVD iimpossiblele to find in eBay or anywhere else. If you happen to get your hands on a copy, consider yourself very lucky. Its a live action sci-fi movie based on Go Nagai's Mazinger Z manga. Yes, you heard me right... LIVE ACTION. If you never knew this existeded, don't worry. Many people, even Mazinger Z hardcore fans, don't know about this. It's very old. I think the movie was produced around 1978, but I could be very wrong on this, so don't quote me. The movie was dubbed into spanish and played in select local theaters for a couple of weeks due to the huge popularity the Mazinger Z cartoon had in Puerto Rico.  I didn't get to see this movie in the theaters, but I did see it when it was released to video. The video version is very rare and it's usually a priced item among local fan's anime collections (those that are lucky enough to get it).    I had a bootleg copy of the movie in VHS. A copy that went AWOL. So, I was desperate to get it. Many years ago I was in Florida and had an opportunity to buy a VHS copy of the live action Mazinger Z in english, but didn't cause it was $60 and I already had the bootleg. Man, was I kicking myself after I lost the bootleg VHS. Anyway, finding the DVD, which is basically a bad VHS copy digitalized into a DVD - R with some crummy chapter stops, made me very happy (until I saw encountered the errors). I really hope that the replacement copy is working.   I'll let you know if these suckers are working later.  Also, in case you are interested, Collector World also offers the entire Mazinger Z series with spanish audio. The guy who produces these DVDs recorded the series when he was a kid and then mixed it with the video from a Hong Kong DVD release of the series. He took out the japanese audio and inserted the spanish track. Pretty neat, huh? Great quality image and a crappy spanish dub. Don't complain, it's the best of both worlds. No other way to get these in spanish. The DVDs are 10 episodes each for around $20. It's a little expensive, but if you are a collector and a Mazinger Z fan, this is a good item to get. If you are interested, let me know and I'll pass on the Collector World's information (number and emails). If you live close, they have a booth in Señorial Plaza Mall.

      Well, this is my first blog. I have no idea what to write, but I'll give it a go. Right now I at work and doing like three or four things at the same time. I'm doing data entry, while I scan another PC for spyware and porn. Weeeeeeee !!!!! Lots of porn. The dude that used that PC was a real sick person. And, of course, I'm backing everything up for myself. Yep, I love my work. I'm supposed to be doing some tech support, but I'm actually talking to my best friend on the phone. Don't tell my boss, okay?  Nothing really exciting going on, so I'll talk a little about myself. I like anime, horror movies, screenplays and filmmaking in general. Here is a small list of stuff I really really like:   Erasure  Sailor Moon Sam Raimi Evil Dead The Monkees WWE DOOM Love Hina Peter Jackson Jackie Chan Zombies Love Hina Azumanga - Daioh Donnie Yen eBay Hentai DVDs Fangoria Screenplays Starvengers Force Five Mazinger Z  ... and a whole mess of other stuff too. I like to talk. I'm also a pretty good listener. Sometimes I'm moody, but most of the time I'm friendly.   My views on the world (for those who like that type of thing) is that everything is fucked up, but things might be better tomorrow (yeah right). I am pro women rights, abortion, death penalty, religious freedom, gay marriage, legalization of drugs, ect. So, I'm probably one of the most politically incorrect people you will ever meet.   My hobbies are watching movies, working on screenplays, reading books on anime, horror, computers and filmmaking in general.   I love to talk. I like to listen too. Feel free to contact me through MSN messenger using the following email: sailorecchi@hotmail.com  Please don't use that email to email me because I have hotmail's  junk filters set way high. It's possible your email won't get through. Feel free to email me through here: ehudders@coqui.net  Oh, very important !!! Feel free to visit me at my web page: www.sailorecchi.com  Nice to meet you all !!!  Sailor Ecchi

       urlLink Fangoria's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen    I was looking forward to getting this book a few months ago. I couldn't wait. So when I saw it at my local Borders I jumped at the chance to but it. When I got home and started to read it, I remembered being very disappointed. The problem with this book is that if you are a novice to horror or rarely read  urlLink Fangoria  magazine, but like horror movies or have a keen interest in them, then this is the book for you. Now, people who literally grew up reading Fangoria will find nothing remotely new in the book. Most of these movies have already been  introduced in the pages of the magazine. The book also doesn't contain much information on the selected movies, except a summary of what is the movie about, main cast and crew, and some small bit of trivia and information about each entry. This last part is where the book should have shined.  urlLink Fangoria  should have enough information and contact info to have added a lot of insider stories on each movies. Heck, a collector of Fangoria magazine would know more about these movies than someone who bought and read only this book. This is sad, especially for  urlLink Fangoria .  I would add, on the other hand, that some parts of this book have grown on me. Mostly some of the selections made. Some are very good, others are questionable. Also, there are some films that should have made the list which are harder to find and better than some of these entries. I will write more about that at the end.  Of the 101 movies, I have only seen about half, even thought I am familiar with almost all of the entries with few exceptions.   I will write here about the one's I have seen and about a few others which I believe are worth mentioning. I will not touch upon the info or trivia of the book or list all of the entries. For that, you will have to buy the  urlLink book . While disappointing, it makes for an interesting coffee table book and, like I said, the less you know about  urlLink Fangoria , the better.  I would like to add that there are many choices in this list that seem like a request by the author for people to give those films a second chance. I can live with that given that some of the selection do deserve a second chance, even thought that would make the title a little misleading. When you read "best horror movies you've never seen", you tend to think that they are so obscure that not even hardcore horror fans know about them. A found very few entries that fit this bill. Heck, most of these films are very accessible to any person that has a video club near by that still stocks old horror vhs or that is buying all those wonderful  urlLink Anchor Bay DVD  releases. Sure, there are exceptions, which I will note below.   (I decided not to put too much detail into my opinion of these movies and their content. I've tried to focus on important elements of each movie and whether or not I agree with the inclusion of movies on the list).  On with the list...      urlLink Alice, Sweet Alice  (A.K.A. Communion)  One word: Scary.  A good start, given that this is the first entry in the list. This movie, to my knowledge, is currently unavailable.     urlLink The Beyond   This is a film that if you are an avid reader of Fangoria and don't know what it is, you should just shoot yourself in the head. Many consider this  urlLink Lucio Fulci's  greatest film. This entry is more for someone who knows very little of horror.   Currently, this movie is available thanks to the efforts of  urlLink Quentin Tarantino  who fought to bring this movie to theaters in a limited release.  It is currently out on DVD thanks at the good people of Anchor Bay. This would most definitely make an awesome addition to your horror collection if you don't currently own it. A very gory film that is full of creepy atmosphere, surprises and a bizarre ending that will either shock you or have you scratching your noodle.  Surprisingly, this is the only  urlLink Lucio Fulci  film in the list. I would have probably added or gone with " urlLink House by the Cemetery ", which I believe is also a great horror movie. Horror film buffs know " urlLink The Beyond  ", but might not know or have seen " urlLink House by the Cemetery ". This would probably have been a better choice.  Other standouts from  urlLink Lucio Fulci  are " urlLink Zombie " (an unauthorized sequel to George Romero's living dead masterpiece " urlLink Dawn of the Dead "), " urlLink Gates of Hell " and the very underrated " urlLink New York Ripper ".     urlLink The Blob  (1988)  Interesting entry. I recall that this remake of the 1958 classic had some wild, gooey special effects. While I don't think this a worthy entry, comparing it to others in the book, I can see why the author would want to add it. The movie does deserve a second chance, especially now that is widely available in DVD.       urlLink The Boneyard   I like this movie. It's fun, gory and silly. Maybe a little too silly for most (even taught it's pretty grim to be a . Still, has some creepy moments and the creature effects are very good. So, if you want to see a horror comedy about dead children and killer mutant puddles, this is the best way to go. Available on DVD.      urlLink The Borrower   I know I saw this movie, but I don't remember anything about it. To my knowledge, it is currently unavailable on DVD, but you might track down a copy of it in VHS.     urlLink Brain Damage   The  urlLink Frank Henenlotter  cult classic. This movie is sick. From the deranged mind of the person who brought you  urlLink Basket Case  (a movie that should have probably been included in this list, but wasn't) and  urlLink Frankenhooker .      urlLink Castle Freak    A real surprise seeing this here, even thought it deserves the honor of appearing in this list. From direct to video master, Charles Band. His company, Full Moon Entertainment, took the horror world by storm back when it started releasing movies.   This was by far one of their best entries, which is not saying much given the amount of duds Full Moon was putting out. I remember when the studio started putting out movies.  urlLink Subspecies ,  urlLink Dollman ,  urlLink Puppet Master  and  urlLink Doctor Mordrid , among others. Then the sequels came and the quality of the films dropped big time (that's what happens when you start a business with heart and then settle for getting quick cash). This movie was really Full Moon's last cry for glory, but by the time of it's release nobody gave a damn. Full Moon had put out so many clunkers that it was hard to tell the good from the bad. Unfortunately, this was one of the good that seemed to have been overlooked.   One of my favorite Full Moon movies is Stuart Gordon's  urlLink Pit and the Pendulum . I think that if Castle Freak got to be here, this one too should have made the list.      urlLink Cemetery Man   I remember reading about this movie and thinking how much I wanted to see it. I managed to record the R - rated version of the movie that was playing midnight on Showtime. During the entire day, I recall moving from place to place watching the movie little by little as I moved from around the University. Back then, they had a lot of places where you could get a small room and watch movies. Of course, this was supposed to be areas designated for the study of film art, but I wasn't going to tell them that I was going to watch a European zombie movie or they would have never let me get access to the rooms.   Half way through, I was thinking that this movie was such a piece of shit. Decided to stop watching until I got home from the University. At home, I finished watching it and I realize that the final half of the film was brilliant. Too bad the first part was lame, slow and stupid.   I would like to see this film again cause I believe that I will like it more second time around, but it isn't available on DVD (unless you buy a region 2 version dvd) and I lost the vhs where I recorded the R-rated version. I know you can track down a copy of the R- rated version, but I am shocked that with all the trash that is being picked up for distribution no a days that no one has taught about releasing this movie. Hey, Anchor Bay, what are you waiting for?     urlLink Cherry Falls   Released on DVD state side on a double bill with a bad John Ritter horror movie, this little gem didn't get much exposure. It was supposed to have a wide release, but it would have received the dreaded NC - 17 rating. It dropped from the radar, but appeared again in a mangled cut made specially for the U.S.A. network. The DVD version has a few more scenes than that version, but it isn't the nasty complete version.  To see the complete version, you will have to buy the region 2 DVD. Again, Anchor Bay, what are you waiting for?     urlLink A Chinese Ghost Story   Boy, did they drop the ball on this one. Don't get me wrong. It's a great movie, but it has no right being included in this list. This movie is more fantasy than horror. And, if you are going to include this film, you might as well add "Mr. Vampire" and "Bride with the White Hair" to the list, which are excellent examples of Chinese fantasy movies.   You can get all these movies through  urlLink Tai Seng  distributors.      urlLink Cronos   This is another movie I saw during my university years. Pretty good, even taught I don't remember it very well. It is currently out on DVD. I will make it a point to seeing again real soon and see if my recollection is correct.     urlLink The Day of the Beast   Strong concept, bad execution. Some of the fx are good, but this film is such a mess. From the creator of the bigger mess " urlLink Accion Mutante " (even taught I taught it was much more entertaining).     urlLink Day of the Dead   Huh? What's this doing here? Okay, I know that this brilliant film has been unjustly ignored, but couldn't you add someone more obscure to the horror fan, like  urlLink George Romero's  " urlLink The Crazies "?  A lot of people hated this movie cause they taught it was slow and had over the top acting. I think it's fantastic. Great special FX too.   For those who have no idea what this film is, it's the third installment in  urlLink George Romero's  excellent living dead trilogy.     urlLink Dark Waters   Saw it. Don't remember. Let's more on.     urlLink Death Machine   Silly movie, with some good FX and some tense moments. If you like this type of movie, a better choice for this list would have been " urlLink Split Second ".     urlLink Deep Rising   Okay, not a bad movie, but a "best horror movie you've never seen"? Please !!! It's an entertaining movie, but it isn't something to write home about. Some cool FX and funny jokes, but we've seen better. Another dud in the list.     urlLink Def by Temptation   Saw this when I was a kid. Thought it sucks. Probably would think the same exact thing if I watched today.     urlLink The Dentist   Okay film. More gruesome than scary. The concept is good. Corbin Bernsen as the crazed dentist is superb. But, again, not a movie to include in a list like this. I mean, if it wasn't so accessible to the horror movie fan, why is there a sequel to this movie? Also, this movie played on TV. I'm sure more people know about this movie than it's given credit for.     urlLink The Devil's Backbone   Fantastic movie. Not really a horror movie, even taught it had a lot of creepy elements. From  urlLink Guillermo del Toro , the same director of  urlLink Cronos  (see above),  urlLink Blade 2  and  urlLink Hellboy . This is the director's best, most artistic movie.   While I understand why this rarely seen movie is on the list, if you watch it hopping to see a horror movie, you will be very disappointed. Has a few scenes of terror, but nothing more. Still, forth seeking out, especially since it's out on DVD.     urlLink Dolls   Before Charles Band's  urlLink Puppetmaster , there was  urlLink Stuart Gordon's  Dolls. Great choice to add to this list. Rarely seen and hard to find unless you buy the region 2 DVD.      urlLink Event Horizon  I love this movie !!! One of my favorites. Shining meets Hellraiser in space. Nice combination. Trouble is that this movie is more accessible than the author gives it credit. Sure, it was a flop in the theaters, but more people have seen this movie in video or in the sci - fi channel than, for example, The Devil's Backbone or Day of the Dead (for that matter). I believe that it was added to this list cause it is very underrated. Deserves a look.   If you like this movie, you might want to check out Pitch Black, an excellent alien clone with a cool concept and killer main character.      urlLink The Evil Within   Interesting movie. Very rare. Not really scary. Has some gory moments. I can accept it as being part of this list, even taught there are a lot of better movies.   For killer baby movies, you're better off with "It's Alive" (surprisingly,unavailable on DVD as of this writing).     urlLink The Exorcist III   Hey, it's better than the second installment, but that ain't saying much cause the second one sucked big time. This one has some pretty scary scares and some sick stuff. Worth watching. I'm not sure if this one is out on DVD. I think not.     urlLink From Beyond   Like Dolls, another Stuart Gordongemm that has yet to be seen of DVD. You can track down an old copy in vhs and a region 2, full screen import DVD.   Hey,  urlLink Jeffrey Combs  is in it. Also, from the same director of Re-Animator. Need I say more?     urlLink Ginger Snaps    One of the best, modern day, werewolf flick. Good story and an interesting gimmick. Has a goth feel to it. Plus the acting is first rate.   The sequels is out too. While the opinion on the  urlLink sequel  is mixed, I liked it very much.   Released in America in a very bad, full screen DVD by Artisan. Fuck Artisan, get the Canadian DVD. Much better, plus a whole mess of features.   A movie about werewolves that came out a few months before Ginger Snaps is also worth mentioning. " urlLink Dog Soldier " premiered on the Sci - Fi channel and quickly moved to a DVD release. Another excellent concept. Very good FX and a fun story that has some good scares and gore.      urlLink Hardware   Good sci - fi horror movie ruined by an extremely slow first half that seems to have no end. Some surreal and bloody images. Still, overrated, but worth a look (try to get the unrated version).     urlLink Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer   One of the most disturbing films ever made. Not an easy movie to watch. This is one great horror movie that you should actually not see. Very hard to forget. This is not a nice movie. What makes it scary? Cause it's based on real horrors. The type you see in the news everyday.      urlLink Horror Express   I'm actually surprised to see this movie in the list. They give it on TV very often. Interesting movie. Entertaining too.     urlLink Humanoids from the Deep   Oh come on !!! A movie about horny fish rapping women? There is a reason people haven't seen this movie. Cause they avoid it like the plague. You should too.     urlLink I Spit of your Grave   This is a revenge movie. Granted, a very good, violent, disturbing revenge movie. But not a horror movie.     urlLink Jack be Nimble   Jack be crap. Overrated. Avoid at all cost.     urlLink Jack's Back  I recall this being a scary thriller. Would like to see it again. I'm not sure if it's out on DVD. I believe it's not.     urlLink The Keep   Saw this movie years ago. I taught it was very creepy. Worth a look, if you can find it.     urlLink Lair of the White Worm   Saw it years ago. Didn't impress me much, even taught I have a feeling that if I see it now, it will probably impress me.      urlLink Last House on the Left   Revenge movie. Not horror.  I believe this was Wes Craven's first movie.     urlLink The Legend of Hell House   Creepy. A must see for horror fans that like their horror with a lot of atmosphere and mystery.      urlLink Let Sleeping Corpses Lie   Good zombie flick. Released on DVD by Anchore Bay. Be sure to add this gem to your horror DVD movie collection.     urlLink Manhunter   First film incarnation of the Thomas Harris novel, Red Dragon. Better made, but less seen than the newer, crappy version.   what's the difference? The director. Manhunter has a talented director behind the cameras, Red Dragon doesn't.     urlLink Maniac   Good, gory fun. Not great, thought. If I recall correctly, has a cool cameo by Tom Savini. I believe he doesn't say a single word. He just gets his head blow off.   The late, great  urlLink Joe Spinell  plays the title villain. Man, can he pull off acting like a crazy fuck.     urlLink Maniac Cop 2   This is a case where the sequel is better made, better directed and better acted than the original (or the second sequel for that matter). Lots of crazy action in this one. Dammit, urlLink Anchor Bay , release this one !!!     urlLink Mute Witness   Nice thriller. Spoiled by some silly humor to ease the tension. This is one of the best entries in the book.      urlLink Necronomicon   Based on an H.P. Lovecraft story.  Piece of shit. Let's move on...  (For Lovecraft inspired fun, you are better off with " urlLink In the Mouth of Madness ", " urlLink Re-Animator " and " urlLink Dagon ")     urlLink The Night Flier   Excellent concept and story, but the success of this movies is  urlLink Miguel Ferrer's  performance. Worth a look.     urlLink Night of the Comet   Interesting concept, lame execution. Starts off good, self-destructs half way through.  Why not try " urlLink Day of the Triffids "? This is an oldie, but goodie.      urlLink Night of the Creeps   A very underrated horror movie. Has a little of everything. Every horror fan should experience this movie. Plays a lot on television. Has like three different endings. A must see. Anchor Bay, take note, another movie you should release.     urlLink The Ninth Gate   Good, but slow. Not really scary. Shouldn't be in this list.     urlLink Open your Eyes  (Abre Tus Ojos)  Good, but not a horror movie !!!! Grrrrrrrrrrr !!!     urlLink Opera   Excellent  urlLink Dario Argento movie. Sure, it's very uneven, but the cinematography and camera tricks are awesome. Lots of gore, too.   This was actually the first  urlLink Dario Argento  movie I saw. It's my personal favorite, even taught Suspira, his classic, is a better movie overall.   Which, btw, funny how Suspira isn't in this list, since many horror fans have yet to learn who is Dario Argento (except those that read  urlLink Fangoria  Magazine).     urlLink Pin   I recall it being very boring.     urlLink Prison   I remember I liked this one. Would like to see it again, but it's not available in the U.S.  There is an uncut, region 2 DVD on sale at eBay.     urlLink Private Parts   I saw this movie when I was a kid. It was on a double bill with " urlLink Carnival of Souls " (a movie that should have also made the list, but didn't). Not a bad movie, except it's not a horror movie. It's a movie about sexual obsession and perversion.    urlLink Pumpkinhead   definitely underrated. Nice choice. Doesn't play much on TV. Has a  urlLink sequel . Stick with the original. Available in DVD.     urlLink Ravenous   This odd little movie is a must see. It's very experimental. More like an art house horror movie. The musical score is crazy.   Sure, not very scary, even taught there is a lot of suspense. It's the type of movie that is gruesome and disturbing, without being gory. A must see.   This was a terrible flop in the theaters. I recall I saw it in the movies and taught it was one of the best movies I had seen all year. It has gain a cult following on video.      urlLink The Resurrected   Slow and boring, but has atmosphere and a bizarre third act.   Based on an H.P. Lovecraft story.     urlLink Screamers   This is another surprise. I don't think it should be here, even taught it's not a bad sci - fi / horror hybrid. Some cool stuff in this one, but you could do better.     urlLink Session 9   Moody and creepy. Builds on character development. A little slow, but that helps build tension. Setting the movie in an abandoned hospital helps too.   Shot on High - Definition video.   urlLink Blair Witch  fans will enjoy this one.  Speaking of  urlLink Blair Witch , there is a very good docu - horror movie that was made before Blair Witch that should have been included in this list. It's called  urlLink Last Broadcast . Very well made, very unjustly ignored.      urlLink The Stepfather   Good stuff. Very creepy. Has a sequel. If I recall, the sequel is very good too.   Don't know why, but this film reminds me of a very good thriller called "Flowers in the Attic". That one is also very creepy. Highly recommended.     urlLink Stir of Echoes   Very underrated thriller that has some creepy supernatural elements. Good acting and directing. Some good scares too. Highly recommended.  If you like this movie, you might also want to see (if you haven't seen them, which I doubt very much) "What Lies Beneath" and "The Others". And, of course, "Sixth Sense" too.   urlLink Kevin Bacon  is really good in this movie. Good performance.    urlLink Swamp Thing   Crap !!! What the fuck is this doing here. Nooooooooooo !!! Not a horror movie, dammit !!! Not even a good movie. What the hell is it doing in this list? Taking space !!! That's what it's doing. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !!!     urlLink Tombs of the Blind Dead   Moody Spanish chiller with some creepy cinematography and music. First part in  urlLink Amando de Ossorio blind dead series (four in all).   Of all four movies, I prefer number three (" urlLink Horror of the Zomb ies") because it was the first one I saw. Very creepy too.   urlLink Anchor Bay  has released this film on a double bill DVD with " urlLink Return of the Evil Dead ". To my understanding, this DVD has been discontinued. I have heard rumors that both movies are missing scene in the  urlLink Anchore Bay 's edition.  urlLink Midnight1  offers both movies uncut.    Well, that's it. Haven't seen the rest, even taught I have a feeling that I've probably seen a few others.  I also made some alternate suggestions as to other movies that should have been included on the list or that you might like to seek out if you liked a particular movie that was on the list. I would like to add some more alternatives below.   Okay, off the top of my head, here are a few films that I would put in my personal list of horror movies you've never seen.  (These are small descriptions on why I like these movies and think they should be on the list. Not really a detailed review.)     urlLink Audition    urlLink Takashi Miike 's film might be slow, but it builds slowly on the suspense and hints always that things will turn dark and menacing. Ends in a truly horrific way. Part of the new wave of Japanese thrillers and horror movies that are slowly filtering into America's shores. A must see.      urlLink Battle Royale   Okay, not really a horror film, but a must see none the less. Since the original list featured several movies that didn't fit into the horror mold, I decided to add this sci - fi action film that is a brutal satire on the survival of the fittest mentality of modern Japanese society. It's " urlLink Lord of the Flies " meets " urlLink The World's Most Dangerous Game ".   This controversial movie hasn't been released in America, but you can order the international version from a few sellers at eBay. Trust me, you won't be disappointeded.   Btw, there is a sequel of this film available, but while entertaining, lacks any of the original's flair. Stick with the first movie.      urlLink Bad Taste   This was  urlLink Peter Jackson 's (the director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) first movie. It's an ultra low -  budget splatter movie about aliens that come to earth to feed on human vomit. A true gore classic. Very well made, considering that it was a labor of love that took almost four years to complete. And, I bet, you probably never even heard of this movie until now. One of the reasons is that this movie was never, to my knoledge, featured in Fangoria (it was mentioned several times and I believe that the VHS anAnchorre Bay DVD release of this movie were reviewed in Fangoria). The movie was featured in Gorezone which was an old gore magazine that was compitting against Fangoria. Aviously, Fangoria won.  Another little gem that you might want to seek out is Peter Jackson's second movie, the muppets on drug flick " urlLink Meet the Feebles ". Not perfect, but funny non the less.   And, of course, there is  urlLink Peter Jackson 's ode to zombies, the hilariously gory " urlLink Brain Dead " (A.K.A. Dead / Alive). Seeying these three movies, you will recognize the director's true potential, but wonder how in the blue hell did a movie studio have the balls to trust this man with $300 million dolars to bring the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the big screen. You might want to seek out Peter Jackson's excellent " urlLink Heavenly Creatures " (for which I believe he was nominated for a "Best International Film Oscar" award, but didn't win).     urlLink Cannibal Holocaust   The definitive cannibal movie, mostly shot in documentary style. Lots of gore, with some actual shocking footage of animals being slaughtered to add to the gruesome impact. Sometimes you can't even tell what is real and what is fiction. This makes this movie the more disturbing.   This controversial movie can be found in different DVD versions on EBay. It is curently unnavailable in the U.S.      urlLink Cure   A stylish, Japanses thriller that gets under your skin and surprises you as it twsit and turns. Some scenes are shot with such visual impact that the burn in your memory. Grows creepier with repeat viewings.      urlLink $la$her$   This little gem is an example of low budget filmmakers thinking big. Good concept, nicexecutionon. Mostly due to the director,  urlLink Maurice Deveraux . I'm willing to bet that if this guy plays his cards right, he can easyly become the next  urlLink Sam Raimi  or  urlLink Peter Jackson . While this movie is no " urlLink Evil Dead " or " urlLink Brain Dead ", it still shows a lot of promise. Worth a look.     That actually is the last item on my list. I can think of a few more ( urlLink Ju-On ,  urlLink Evil Dead Trap ,  urlLink Eko Eko Azarak ,  urlLink The Eye ,  urlLink Versus ,  urlLink Tomie , ect), but I think it best to leave it at that for now. I might create a new list combining the original list, my suggestions and a few other movies that I haven't mention this. If I do, I will be sure to publish it here. For now, I'm going to sign off and go to sleep. Goodnight everybody !!!    urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      WWE Raw Review for 5/24/04  First, I would like to take a moment and comment that this is the first time I try to do something like this. I usually read excellent Mr. Tito's review of RAW on the  urlLink Lords of Pain  website.   Yesterday I tried to jolt some notes to use to day, but for the life of me I will never understand how Mr. Tito and the guys who participate at the wrestling forums can watch the show and type at the same time. Trust me, it's very hard. I kept missing stuff as I wrote stuff down and I decided to forget about the notes all together as the show progressed. I wanted to take notes because I am very forgetful, but I guess I will have to go with my memories. Anyway, I left the notes at home, so I have no other choice.  Okay, show starts off with a recap of last weeks battle royal where Shawn Michaels cost HHH a win. Next we move to a segment where HHH chews out the rest of Evolution for not being there for him (clearly forgetting that his team took out most of the participants in the battle royal until they where also eventually eliminated). This segment only served to announce the first match of the night which was Ric Flair VS. Edge.   Ric Flair VS. Edge  This match was a total disappointment mostly because it was so sloppy. Neither performer looked motivated. Edge tried two spears that were poorly executed. There also seem to be confusion in several parts of the match, probably due to miss pacing by the participants or a missed event. Either way, it was a surprising poor start to RAW.  Funny how people chant Edge's name, but explode into cheer when Ric Flair gets the upper hand. It's hard not to love the guy, even taught recent comments he's made have made him seem like a total ass. Particularly comments related to how he dislikes fans using insider terms and talking like wrestlers...  Ric, wrestling is not real. People know it's not real. People like the fantasy aspect of wrestling. Most imagine themselves as being part of that fantasy and greatly enjoy talking like insiders and believing that they are part of a good thing. That's what good fans do. It's not a bad thing, it's a good thing.   Still, Ric is the man in the ring. Even taught I am still curious of what exacly he is trying to accomplish all those times he goes to the third rope. He never gets to execute that move. Yesterday I taught he was actually going to make it, but Edge caught him in mid air with what I believe to be a spear (it looked more like a car crash actually). Some people say that he is actually trying to do a shooting star press. Funny stuff. Who knows? What ever it is, it's probably devastating given that he still insists on going up and trying it out.   Now that I think of it, that would probably be the mark out moment of 2004 if he actually gets to pull of a move from the third rope and win.   A little mistake in the match, or it seems like it, where Edge pins Ric Flair and there is a three count, but the referee says it's a two count. Edge looks confused and J.R. comments that Flair got his shoulder up. He didn't. What happened there? Probably Orton, who was at ring side, was supposed to make the save, but didn't. The crowd was not happy about that.  Randy Orton's intervention leads to Shelton Benjamin running in to confront him. They brawl and we get to see one of Randy Orton's biggest flaws. He sells the beating in a silly way. Reminds me of "Hollywood" Rock, who is a great talker, but exaggerate his movements and reaction in the ring for entertainment effect. This is not the effect Randy Orton should be looking for (even taught sometimes it can be funny, but no in the way it should be).  Watch ends with Edge getting the pin. Lame. Could have been better.   We move to a segment with HHH and Batista waiting for Shawn Michaels in the parking lot. Which leads to HHH confusing Steve Richard and beating the stuffing out of him. It's sad cause I have a feeling that Steve Richards can do much more than what he is given.  Next I believe was a segment with Lita and Matt Hardy, who claims that she has been ignoring his calls. She tells Matt that she loves him and that she will show him how much she loves him tonight. She goes into her locker room, where an apparent invisible camera man happens to be tapping everything without her knowing it (look, just because wrestling is fake, doesn't mean you have to take liberties in destroying the illusion of reality. Very poor, WWE!). Kane pops up behind her and Lita insinuate that they "did something together" and that since that was done, everything is "over". To which Kane says, in a menacing voice, that it's over... Everything is over. Yeah, right! Anyway, she backs away, straightens herself, walks out of the locker room and leaves with Matt. I hope this isn't the WWE ideas of ending the story line (even taught it deserves to end quickly).  This story line is a mystery. I have a feeling that the whole Kane - Matt - Lita triangle was just an excuse to bring Jeff Hardy back to the WWE. Since Jeff still doesn't want to go to drug rehabilitation, the WWE is holding firm on not bringing him back until he does. I have a feeling that they gave up on him and decided to end the story line quickly, which was why Kane got the win in the battle royal and is now set to face Benoir in the main event of the Bad Blood PPV. What a mess!  I believe that the next segment was a match between La Resistance and the team of Hurricane and Rosey.  For God sake, get Hurricane back to the cruserweight division at Smack down. That is where he belongs. Right now you have four people in the ring who have fought each other hundreds of times. It's the same freaking match. And they are all stale. Why? Cause these gimmicks don't have legs. Their old. There is not much more that you can squeeze out of them and, truth be told, is hurting them. With no more back stage segments (which were pretty funny), this team is just floating around with no clear path.   La Resistance wins, but nobody cares.   Now, my memory is faulty, but I believe there is a segment with HHH and Shawn Michaels beating the living daylights out of each other in the parking lot. Pretty boring given that we've seen this hundreds of times last year with their original feud. They get separated and HHH goes to Eric Bischoff's office to complain which leads to an announced match at Bad Blood between HHH and Shawn Michaels. Shawn attacks HHH from behind and they both land on poor Eric (hahahahaha). They brawl and totally destroy Eric's office which prompts him to order every wrestler in the building to help keep HHH and Shawn Michaels away from each other or he is going to fire everyone.   Right here I think I clustered several segments together. Other than this, we had a good match between Randy Orton and Batista VS. the team of Shelton Benjamin and Jericho. Jericho was really on tonight.   I like the new RAW structure where they start the show with a hot match (even taught tonight's was a dud), follow it up with another hot match at the middle hour and then Finish up with a match or a brawl. No long rants!!!!! Please keep it that way. Nothing makes people want to change channels and see something else than a guy saying how good he is and how he is going to rip his opponent in half for the hundredth time this month.   I was also thinking of the "Smackdown Five" (as in, five wrestlers that made the show great). I recall a year ago that RAW was the declining program and Smackdown was the hit show. Now, the table have been turned. RAW is the hot program, whereas Smackdown is going down the drain in ratings and quality. Or so I've heard. I don't get UPN, so I don't get to see Smackdown.   Who were these "Smackdown Five"? Kurt Angle, Brock Lesnar, Eddie Guerrero, Edge and Benoir. Besides these five, we had Chavo Guerrero, Shelton Benjamin, Rhyno and Tajiri who also gave excellent performances in the ring, making this show the superior show. What happened? For starters, Edge, Benoir, Shelton Benjamin, Tajiri and Rhyno (who is doing absolutely nothing on RAW) are no longer in Smackdown. Brock Lesner flew the coup for the NFL. Kurt Angle is injured. And Chave Guerrero, as the cruiserweight champion, who is feuding with... Jackie!?!?! WTF!?!?!? Well, that leaves Eddie Guerro as champion feuding with... Bradshaw?!?!?! WTF?!?!?!? Also, didn't the writers tell Rey Mysterio the other day that "they didn't have anything for him" right now storyline wise?   But wait, at least they have several new wrestlers that they got from RAW... Like... Rico (who has potential to be a great wrestler, but is being held back by a dumb gimmick)!!!!! Erm... okay, how about Booket T (who got his ass handed back to him by the Undertaker at Judgement Day). Then, there is the Dudley Boyz. I like the Dudley Boyz. Now they are heals. All is good in the world... If they are used properly. And, at least RVD is giving Rey Mysterio something to do on Smackdown.   I will say this, sounds like Rene Dupree (with his feud for the United States Championship against John Cena) is working out fine. Which is good. Cause Smackdown needs new stars bad.   Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, Jericho rules. Thanks for reminding me.   The "RAW Five" have really helped the show. These guys are Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Benoir, HHH (yes, once he started selling and loosing matches clean, he's become interesting and actually fun to watch) and Shelton Benjamin. What??? Shelton Benjamin??? You heard me right. This kid was ready for the main event scene. Keep pushing him. Sure, his mic skills suck, but he has power and speed in the ring. Plus the crowd loves him and, given his two wins on HHH, he is hot as hell.   Edge just isn't 100% in his game (yet) and that mini feud with Kane did nothing for both of them.   Rhyno isn't being used for shit.   Ric Flair is always great (except for his match with Edge just now), but the age is showing. Still, when he is on his game, he looks like a million bucks.   Randy Orton has the looks, the mic skills, the attitude (that cocky, arrogant attitude just makes you wanna slap him and hate him... Perfect !!!) and, to be frank, the ring skills. But he is missing something. Can't put my finger on it. Maybe if he stops selling in a silly, exaggerated way, then he would be something great. I hope his feud with Shelton Benjamin elevates both.   (I must add something here. Randy Orton's match with Mick Foley proved that this guy wants to give 100% for the fans. I really think that in a year or two, this guy is going to be one of the permanent main event wrestlers of the company. He is almost there now.)  Batista... Look, Batista is clumsy, but I feel like he has a lot of potential. He has the brutish look. Has the intensity. He just has to learn that even if you play a hulking animal, that doesn't mean you have to destroy your opponent for real. He has to protect more. By the way, on that subject, has anybody seen Tajiri since his match with Batista a while back...  One last thing on Batista. Last week, during the battle royal, there was a moment where he confronted Kane that generated such excitement that it became almost surreal. There was intensity and chemistry between both in that confrontation. The audience felt it and they actually cheered. Interesting...  Oh, also, Tajiri is always great. Love the guy. I was sad when RVD went to Smackdown, until I found out Tajiri would be coming to RAW. Gee, I suddenly don't miss RVD.   Something I forgot to mention is that Mr. McMahon announced the start of the "RAW Diva Search reality contest". The winner will get $250,000 and a one year contract (One year? What happened to the life time contract they usually offer? Like the one that they gave Tough Enough champions Nydia and Jackie Gaylard... oh, I see...).   Anyway, back to the show.  Victoria came out to new music and a new dance step that really does shit for her as a wrestler. I mean, yes, I like that booty shake she is doing, but it really doesn't give her the same depth that crazy bitch gimmick gave her (and the TATU song she came used to have was much better music). The trouble with Victoria is that she is fantastic and the crowd loves her, but since she turned face (Mr. Flair, don't get pissed at me cause I used this word, ok?), she hasn't received any development into her character. She went from crazy bitch to... to... well, smiling and waving women's wrestler. I liked the crazy bitch better. I will say this, she does something that I think is essential and that is to play to the crowd. Like I said, the crowed loves her. I'm not sure what the audience will think of the dance moves taught. I mean, she's a wrestler, not Michael Jackson (thank God, for that). Also, there isn't a gimmick to justify all the dancing, except for the new music. Also, simply dancing does not get wrestlers over with the crowd (*cough* *cough* Lance Storm *cough*).  Another thing, it seemed so awkward the way she was dancing. Not really sexy. Just, weird. Not sure how it looked live. Maybe people will cheer it. Dunno. Time will tell.   Pretty decent match with Victoria defeating Molly in a non-tile match (A word of advice to the WWE: too many of these will ruin the women's title).   I like the woman's wrestling division. I think they work really hard, but they are so disorganized story line wise. Funny, cause a year ago people complained that there was too much story to the women's matches and bad wrestling. Now the wrestling is pretty good, but the writers don't seen to give a damn.  Sad, cause they brought Nydia and I have a feeling they have no idea what to do with her (I have a couple of suggestions). She doesn't have the ring or mic skills to be a credible face (again, Mr. Flair, forgive me).   Molly and Gail Kim are great as heels. Actually, I just say this cause I think that Gail Kim is very very sexy (but then again I find all Asian women to be sexy). I am glad Gail Kim is getting pushed. That way I can see her more in TV. I am looking forward to the Victoria VS. Gail Kim match at Bad Blood. Yes, sir.  Oh, then we have Trish and Lita rounding up the women's division. Trish is in a story line that apparently doesn't have room for her to fight. And Lita is stuck in that dead end Kane gimmick (which, like I said, I believe just self destruct tonight due to lack on interest or simply stupidity on the WWE writers part).  And what the fuck happened to Ivory. Yes, I know she is in that Saturday morning WWE show called...erm... Experience, right? Something like that. Don't watch it. Don't care. Saturday morning is for sleeping or cartoons.   We move on to the Eugene and Regal VS. Garrison Cade & Jonathan Coachman. But wait !!! Johnny Nitro announces that William Regal ca't fight cause Eric Bischoff hasn't reinstated him. So, now it will be a handicap match with Eugene VS. Garrison Cade & Jonathan Coachman (Gee, like Eugene could break the Coachman in half).   I was kinda sad cause I was looking forward to seeing Regal fight in the ring again. I like the guy. I think he is great. I was very sad when I heard that he might be retiring due to the blood thinning decease that had cause him to take so much time off. When I read that not only was he coming back, but he was training to come back at the top of his game, I was ecstatic. Alas, tonight will not be the night we will see the guy wrestle. Still, judging from bhis reaction, looks like he will be turning face to protect Eugene from big, bad Eric Bischoff. Which is good, cause I always wanted to see William Regal go head to head as a face against a heel like Ric Flair. I hope we can see something like that in the near future.  A comment on the Eugene "retard" gimmick. Like many, I have reservations about this gimmick. Mostly cause the wrestler that is doing the character looks to have charisma and good to great wrestling skill. He really does deserve better.   Right now, the gimmick is working and is over big time, but... Why do I worry? One word: RICO !!!!! Nothing worst than having a good wrestler with a gimmick he can't recover from. And, people please, how do you stop being retarded or "slow"? You don't.   I will also comment on the fact that while in the short term I think the gimmick is funny and entertaining, I have a beef with it cause my real name is Eugene too !!! Dammit, get so much shit from my friends about that. Grrrrrr !!!!!   Eugene looks to have a handicap match against the team of Garrison Cade & Jonathan Coachman until it's announced that benoir is going to be his tag team partner. Pretty decent match that is mostly for entertainment purposes. Nothing better that watching Benoir beat the shit out of the Coach.  I will add here that unlike what is being said, I like the Coach as a heel (Sorry!!! Sorry, Mr. Flair. Please don't get angry with me for using this word). I remmeber when everybody and their sister would get in the Coach's face. It was a matter of time before Coach went postal.  Heel Coach is better than face Coach (Damn, Flair must really hate me now. Maybe he will stop this post and get someone else to write it *wink* *wink*).    Benoir and Eugene win and all is right in the world. Until we go back to HHH and HBK brawling and having half of the locker room try unsuccessfully to keep them apart. Damn, they're really beating the crap out of each other. One thing I will give them is that they are pulling no punches for this feud.   Funny how both of these guys seem so powerful, no other wrestler can keep them apart.   Eric comes out and announces that for Bad Blood, it's going to be HHH VS. Shawn Micheals in a Hell in the Cell match (which I know will deliver in spades and be a total blood bath).   Then, the show ends. Okay, back to your normal lives people. There is nothing more to see here (Unless you wanna see that cartoon with the super hero who is also a stripper).   Well, that ends my recalp of the show. Now for the review.   It was an ok show, which is much better than what we had a year ago this same time where the show was pure garbage. Only one real, solid match with Jericho and Shelton Benjamin taking on Randy Orton and Batista. A lot of build up for the Bad Blood PPV, which is a big plus. The show was entertaining, but, given the almost excellent track record RAW has had in the last few weeks, it was pretty lack luster. I would give this show a C- in rating.  I am very interested in seeing what the grade for the show is when Mr. Tito loads up his review of the show. When I like a show, Mr. Tito hates it. When Mr. Tito like a show, I hate it. Still, I never miss it. Since I didn't like this show mutch, I'm guessing he probably liked it. Even taught, I will be frank, there was a lot to hate in this show.   You can read his review in this  urlLink page  (he takes a while in putting up his review cause, unlike me, he has a life). Be sure to visist Mr. Tito at his blog  urlLink here .   Well, that's it. No more to say. This was my first and, due to the amount of time and trouble, I think it's probably my last. Just kidding. I will try to have one of these done every Tuesday. Next Tuesday's will probably be shorter. As you can see, this one was long cause I added my two cents on just about everything. I plan to be brief next time around. As in "I like this" or "I hate that".  I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I liked typing it. Well, until next Tuesday (or at least my next post).

      (Warning: Contains adult language and situations)  Who is "Lara Roxx" and what is her story? Her real name or age is not known. What is known is that she is a model that decided to go to California to make it big in the porn industry. She arrived in L.A. in mid-March from Montreal, on a ticket paid for with supposedly borrowed funds. All she wanted to do was perform in enough scenes to create a "nest-egg" that she could take back to Canada where she would go on with my life and leave that type of life behind her. Three months later, she is now broke, jobless, HIV-positive and part of a HIV Outbreak scare that is breaking apart the porn industry.  Around February, Roxx had been performing (mostly for Canadian-based Internet sites), when she met Daniel Perrault, who later became her manager. Originally, Daniel Parrault had reservations about managing Lara. She had been taught since she was a girl about sexually trasmitted deceases and was very apprehensive about having to do "anals" and sex without condoms.   The pron industry sells fantasies. Condoms break with that fantasy. So many times, adult stars are ask to do their scenes without the use of proper protection. Sometimes, protection is used, but later removed for scenes involving anything oral.  Perrault brought Roxx into contact with director Marc Anthony, who was reportedly in Montreal scouting for talent, and he in turn introduced her to his actors. Among them was Darren James.   Darren James had recently returned from a trip to Brazil where he told Roxx he had been with several women. While she had taken some STD tests, she didn't know that it was commonplace for performers to show each other their tests before beginning a scene. Hence, she never asked if he had taken one after the trip.   Most adult performers prefer to stay away from working in Brazil. There are a lot of HIV-positive cases there. Some performers can buy a fake test for $10.  Lara was told that she was going to do a double penetration with Marc and Darren. It ended up being a double anal. She reluctantly agreed, feeling suckered into it by people she taught where her friends.   Roxx developed rashes and a case viral pharyngitis, for which she visited several doctors. Eventually Daniel Perrault learned that Darren James tested positive for HIV and told Lara. Her reaction was as expected.   She became part of a list of over 30 adult performers quarantined who needed to be tested for HIV. On April 15, Lara Roxx tested HIV positive. She was the first.  Currently, several performers are awaiting their results with dread and fear. Already two performers, Miss Arroyo and Jessica Dee, have tested HIV positive.   To this, a stunned Roxx said: "It totally made me realize how I trusted this system that wasn't to be trusted at all, because it obviously doesn't work."  This has sent shock waves across the pron industry and has open debate for new, better HIV testing procedures and work related health safety precautions. Oddly enough, most porn companies are still resisting the idea of using condoms in their productions. To the extent that many are actually threatening to move away from California if legislation is passed enforcing the use of condoms.   One studio executive even went as far as to compare watching a male performer using a condom to watching a movie where a stunt man in doing a dangerous stunt and you suddenly see the safety harnes.   Pretty smart people in the pron industry, no?  Currently, Lara Roxx is planning to sue several American producers for "several million dollars".

      (Weeeeeeeee !!!!! Wrestling tonight !!! Let's see what the show is about)  From the  urlLink WWE ...  WHAT'S NEXT FOR KANE? May 24, 2004  Last week's Monday Night RAW was a memorable one for Kane. The Big Red Monster defeated Val Venis in singles competition, won a Battle Royal to become the No. 1 Contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Bad Blood and received an answer of "yes" from Lita to a question he posed several weeks ago. With Kane in top form after last week's success, what is next for him as he prepares for his match at Bad Blood? Also, will his question to Lita be revealed? Find out on RAW.     Speaking of the Battle Royal, Kane's victory was a result of the suspended Shawn Michaels gaining a measure of payback from Triple H. When the final two were Triple H and Kane, HBK appeared out of nowhere to eliminate The Game and give Kane a trip to Bad Blood. The Game was enraged as RAW came to an end, and it is expected that he will be in a bad way this coming week on RAW. What will his reaction be? Find out on RAW.  Triple H wasn't the only member of Evolution to have a bad night last Monday.  Will Ric Flair's luck turn around this week when he faces Edge one-on-one?  Find out on RAW.  And the question on everybody's mind is what's in store for Eugene after taking down Garrison Cade and Jonathan Coachman last week with a little help from his good friend, The Rock.  Find out on RAW this Monday as Eugene and William Regal face off against Garrison Cade and Jonathan Coachman.  All of this and more as the road to Bad Blood continues on Monday Night RAW at 9/8 PM CT on Spike TV.

      Hey, I've just received the Getter Robot G DVDs. This was a real find. Retail for these guys on the market is usually $80 (Visual Arts in Condado has them for $75 and you can't get them on eBay for no less than $62, when available). I got these for $28.95 (plus $15.00 S/H) at  urlLink Anime Icon . This is the five disk set that includes the entire series from episode 1 to episode 51 (in Japanese with English subtitles). Haven't tested these puppies out yet, but I'm sure I am going to have a hell of a time doing it tonight. It's no secrete how much I like this series, since it's one of my favorite anime mecha series from my childhood (well, no. Mazinger G is, but this one is pretty close).   I love old giant robot anime. My exposure to this series was as part of the "Festival de Robots" anime block that included Grendizer (another of my favorites). This block, better known to the US as Force Five, was a big hit here in Puerto Rico. Actually helped open the doors for the current interest in the genre of Japanese animation. Same can be said for anime fans in the States.   The Getter Robot series was called "Starvengers" in America. Only 39 episodes where dubbed into English. These episodes are from a series which I believe follows the Getter Robo G series (which is the one I have). This dub was done by Jim Terry Productions, who later re-cut the entire series into an excellent two hour movie (of which I've managed to acquire the Spanish version and will be getting the English dub soon).   There are actually about four different series of Getter Robot (one of which is currently playing in Japan). There are also several OVAs ("Direct To Video Animation") and movies (mostly team ups with Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger and Grendizer). This is because Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, Grendizer and Getter Robo were created by the same genius, Nagai Go, and the operate closely in the same "universe". Nagai Go is also the creator of the Cutey Honey, DevilMan, Kekko kamen and Violence Jack mangas.

      Simpson Beats Spears To Daisy Duke Role   Britney Spears's hopes of landing the role of Daisy Duke in the forthcoming movie version of The Dukes Of Hazzard have been dashed - after bosses handed it to Jessica Simpson. While star Spears had expressed an interest in playing the sexy character from the '70s/'80s TV show, singer Simpson has been chosen as the blonde who will fill the extra-short shorts of original Daisy Duke Catherine Bach. Simpson's manager father Joe tells America's Star magazine, "She is really excited." Simpson herself adds, "I wanna wear those shorts so bad!" The film, about three redneck cousins, two corrupt public officials and a souped- up Dodge Charger car, begins production this summer.

      (I wish I could make shit like this up !!! Again, from the  urlLink Internet Movie Database )   Hilton and Porn Star Strip for Each Other   The Simple Life star Paris Hilton shocked onlookers by baring her breasts for porn legend Ron Jeremy - in return for a glimpse at his infamously large manhood. Cheeky Hilton, 23, and her actress friend Bijou Phillips approached the X- rated film star at a Los Angeles party and asked to see his notoriously large penis. And 51-year-old Jeremy agreed to oblige, but only if they flashed their chests. A source says, "Ron is only in porn for one reason and it's certainly not his looks. The girls really wanted to see it. So they all went off to the toilets and five minutes later Bijou came out saying, 'It's bigger than my boyfriend's!'"     (Okay..........)

      (This article is from the  urlLink Internet Movie Database )  Director Quentin Tarantino has lashed out at reports he awarded Michael Moore the prestigious Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for political reasons. Tarantino headed the jury at the annual movie event on the French Riviera and presented the Oscar-winning filmmaker with the festival's highest honor on Saturday, for his anti-George W Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. Moore's film criticize the Bush administration and the White House foreign policy since the September 11th attacks. Tarantino says, "When I was on stage with Michael Moore, I knew all this politics crap would be brought up. I just whispered in his ear and said, 'I just want you to know it was not because of the politics that you won this award. You won it because we thought it was the best film that we saw.'" Disney, who financed the making of the film under their Miramax studio, have refused to distribute it in America. Although Moore has been looking for a new distributor over the past few weeks, he now expects to have a distributor "within the next 24 hours", since picking up the Palme d'Or.

      I was putting some clothes in the washing machine when I noticed something in the water. It was a five dollar bill. A wet five dollar bill! Damn, I was wondering where that had gone. I put it in my shirt pocket two weeks ago and lost track of it. Actually taught I had spent it and didn't remember. Now, I am very happy cause I was very hungry and didn't have any cash on me. Now, as if dropped by the angels in heaven, I have five dollars to buy myself food. Weeeeeeeeeeee !!! Of course, I have to wait for the bill to dry up, but it was still very lucky of me to find it before I put the dirty clothes in the washer. Talk about money laundering !!!  =;-D

      (This is a joke Marcos sent me. Pretty funny stuff. Enjoy.)  Question Time....  George Bush goes to a primary school to talk about the war.  After his talk he offers question time.  One little boy puts up his hand and George asks him what  his name is.  "Billy."  "And what is your question, Billy?"  "I have 3 questions... First, why did the USA invade Iraq without the support of  the UN?  Second, why are you President when Al Gore got  more votes?  And third, whatever happened to Osama Bin  Laden?"  Just then the bell rings for recess. George Bush informs  the kiddies that they will continue after recess.  When they resume George says,  "OK, where were we? Oh that's right question time. Who has a question?"  Another little boy puts up his hand. George points him out  and asks him what his name is.  "Steve"  "And what is your question, Steve?"  "I have 5 questions... First, why did the USA invade Iraq without the  support of the UN?  Second, why are you President when Al Gore got more  votes?  Third, whatever happened to Osama Bin Laden?  Fourth, why did the recess bell go 20 minutes early? And fifth, what the fuck happened to Billy?"

      A Heretical View of File Sharing By JOHN SCHWARTZ Source: From the  urlLink New York Times  Published: April 5, 2004    The music industry says it repeatedly, with passion and conviction:  downloading hurts sales.  That statement is at the heart of the war on file sharing, both of music and movies, and underpins lawsuits against thousands of  music fans, as well as legislation approved last week by a House  Judiciary subcommittee that would create federal penalties for  using what is known as peer-to-peer technology to download  copyrighted works. It is also part of the reason that the Justice  Department introduced an intellectual-property task force last  week that plans to step up criminal prosecutions of copyright  infringers.  But what if the industry is wrong, and file sharing is not  hurting record sales?  It might seem counterintuitive, but that is the conclusion  reached by two economists who released a draft last week of the  first study that makes a rigorous economic comparison of directly  observed activity on file-sharing networks and music buying.  "Downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically  indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates,"  write its authors, Felix Oberholzer-Gee of the Harvard Business  School and Koleman S. Strumpf of the University of North Carolina  at Chapel Hill.  The industry has reacted with the kind of flustered consternation  that the White House might display if Richard A. Clarke showed up  at a Rose Garden tea party. Last week, the Recording Industry  Association of America sent out three versions of a six-page  response to the study.  The problem with the industry view, Professors Oberholzer-Gee and  Strumpf say, is that it is not supported by solid evidence.  Previous studies have failed because they tend to depend on  surveys, and the authors contend that surveys of illegal activity  are not trustworthy. "Those who agree to have their Internet  behavior discussed or monitored are unlikely to be representative  of all Internet users," the authors wrote.  Instead, they analyzed the direct data of music downloaders over a  17-week period in the fall of 2002, and compared that activity  with actual music purchases during that time. Using complex  mathematical formulas, they determined that spikes in downloading  had almost no discernible effect on sales. Even under their  worst-case example, "it would take 5,000 downloads to reduce the  sales of an album by one copy," they wrote. "After annualizing,  this would imply a yearly sales loss of two million albums, which  is virtually rounding error" given that 803 million records were  sold in 2002. Sales dropped by 139 million albums from 2000 to 2002.  "While downloads occur on a vast scale, most users are likely  individuals who would not have bought the album even in the absence  of file sharing," the professors wrote.  In an interview, Professor Oberholzer-Gee said that previous  research assumed that every download could be thought of as a lost  sale. In fact, he said, most downloaders were drawn to free music  and were unlikely to spend $18 on a CD.  "Say I offer you a free flight to Florida," he asks. "How likely  is it that you will go to Florida? It is very likely, because the  price is free." If there were no free ticket, that trip to Florida  would be much less likely, he said. Similarly, free music might  draw all kinds of people, but "it doesn't mean that these people  would buy CD's at $18," he said.  The most popular albums bought are also the most popular  downloads, so the researchers looked for anomalous rises  in downloading activity that they might compare to sales  activity. They found one such spike, Professor Oberholzer-Gee  said, during a German school holiday that occurred during the  time they studied. Germany is second to the United States in  making files available for downloading, supplying about 15  percent of online music files, he said. During the vacation,  students who were home with time on their hands flooded the  Internet with new files, which in turn spurred new downloading  activity. The researchers then looked for any possible impact in  the subsequent weeks on sales of CD's.  Professor Oberholzer said that he had expected to find that  downloading resulted in some harm to the industry, and was startled  when he first ran the numbers in the spring of 2003. "I called  Koleman and said, 'Something is not quite right - there seems to be  no effect between file sharing and sales.' "  Amy Weiss, an industry spokeswoman, expressed incredulity at what  she deemed an "incomprehensible" study, and she ridiculed the  notion that a relatively small sample of downloads could shed  light on the universe of activity.  The industry response, titled "Downloading Hurts Sales," concludes:  "If file sharing has no negative impact on the purchasing patterns of  the top selling records, how do you account for the fact that,  according to SoundScan, the decrease of Top 10 selling albums in  each of the last four years is: 2000, 60 million units; 2001,  40 million units; 2002, 34 million units; 2003, 33 million units?"  Critics of the industry's stance have long suggested that other  factors might be contributing to the drop in sales, including a  slow economy, fewer new releases and a consolidation of radio  networks that has resulted in less variety on the airwaves. Some  market experts have also suggested that record sales in the 1990's  might have been abnormally high as people bought CD's to replace  their vinyl record collections.  "The single-bullet theory employed by the R.I.A.A. has always  been considered by anyone with even a modicum of economic  knowledge to be pretty ambitious as spin," said Joe Fleischer,  the head of sales and marketing for BigChampagne, a company that  tracks music downloads and is used by some record companies to  measure the popularity of songs for marketing purposes.  The industry response stresses that the new study has not gone  through the process of peer review. But the response cites  refuting statistics and analysis, much of it prepared by market  research consultants, that also have not gone through peer  review.  One consultant, Russ Crupnick, vice president of the NPD Group,  called the report "absolutely astounding." Asked to explain how  the professors' analysis might be mistaken, he said he was still  trying to understand the complex document: "I am not the level  of mathematician that the professors purport to be."  Stan Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas, author of  an essay cited by the industry, said the use of a German holiday  to judge American behavior was strained. Professor Liebowitz  argued in a paper in 2002 that file sharing did not affect music  sales, but said he had since changed his mind.  The Liebowitz essay appeared in an economics journal edited by  Gary D. Libecap, a professor of economics at the University of  Arizona, who said that his publication was not peer reviewed,  though the articles in it were often based on peer-reviewed work.  Professor Libecap said he attended a presentation by Professor  Strumpf last week, and said the file-sharing study "looks really  good to me."  "This was really careful, empirical work," Professor Libecap said.  The author of another report recommended by the industry said that  the two sets of data used by the researchers should not be compared.  "They can't get to that using the two sets of data they are  using - they aren't tracking individual behavior," said Jayne  Charneski, formerly of Edison Media Research, who prepared a report  last June that she said showed that 7 percent of the marketplace  consists of people who download music and do not buy it. That  number is far lower than the authors of the new study estimated.  "There's a lot of research out there that's conducted with an  agenda in mind," said Ms. Charneski, now the head of research  for the record label EMI.

      (This is something my friend Marcos sent me by email the other day. It has really helped me a lot in my job)   From a strictly mathematical viewpoint it goes like this:   What makes 100%?  What does it mean to give more than a 100%?  Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?  We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give more than 100%. How about achieving 103%?  Well, here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions: If the letters of the alphabet A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z were represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26, then:  H - A - R - D - - W - O - R - K would be: 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98% and,  K - N - O - W - L - E - D - G - E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96% but,   A - T - T - I - T - U - D - E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100% however  B - U - L - L - S - H - I - T 2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103% and,  look how far ass kissing will take you: A - S - S - - K - I - S - S - I - N - G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%.   So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that: While, hard work and knowledge will get you close, and, attitude will get you there, it's Bullshit & Ass Kissing that will put you over the top!  I hope this helps to clear things up.

      U.S. filmmaker Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top prize Saturday at the Cannes Film Festival. This is most definitely a great achievement, given that the movie is the first documentary to win the price since Jacques Cousteau's "The Silent World" in 1956. This follows a great win last year in the Academy Award where his "Bowling for Columbine" earned his a win in the category of best documentary. It also earned him a special prize at Cannes in 2002.   Congratulations Michael Moore !!!!  How, you might as why my title says "Disney is fucked"? Well, for starters, this movie was produced by Miramax, which is owned by Disney. It is obvious that Miramax, trying to capitalize on Moore's oscar win, gave the filmmaker free reign to make this movie. What is it about? From what I hear, it's a scathing indictment of White House actions after the September 11 attacks. It accuses U.S. President George W. Bush and friends of stealing the 2000 election, overlooking terrorism warnings before September 11 and fanning fears of more attacks to secure Americans' support for the Iraq war (all of this which I also fully believe).  Now, this looks like a sure fire hit for Disney, right? Well, before Saturday, the word on the street was that not only didn't Disney want to release the movie, but they were even looking into selling the rights to another company so that they could take care of the distribution. WTF?!?!?!??!?!??!?!?  Yep, you heard right. Disney wants no part of the movie. Why? Here is where we introduce into our little story Mr. Jeb Bush, brother of U.S. President George W. Bush, A.K.A. the governor of Florida where Disney has it's biggest team parts. I think you already have an idea of where this is going.   Disney is afraid that if they go forward with the distribution of this movie, big bad Florida governor is going to do some nasty things to the parks. Sounds like Disney hasn't been paying as much in taxes as they should have been. Maybe some permits missing? How about some lawsuits or claims against Disney that have been kept quiet or stomped.? So many things... A movie like this can make enemies out of good political friends.  So, Disney decides to get rid of the movie, pissing off Miramax and straining their relationship (Miramax is the home of Tarantino, Roberts Rodriguez, Scary Movie, Scream and other franchise movies that have made big bucks for Disney). Guess Disney favors power over logic.  Anyway, now Disney is in a big pile of doggie doo doo (A.K.A. "shit").   This little documentary movie has just one the freaking Palme d'Or award at Cannes. This is the most prestigious film award in the whole freaking world. Which means this movie will be a sure fire hit around the world (Barton Fink being an exception).   Which, btw, Pulp Fiction (also a Miramax movie) won the Palme d'Or in the year it was released and look how well it did. *wink* *wink*  So, Disney has three choices:  1) Let Miramax release the movie (thereby salvaging the Miramax - Disney relationship) and bringing on the wrath of Jeb Bush, U.S. President George W. Bush (A.K.A. The big baby that wants to rule the world) and every other twisted republican that wants to take a crack at the company.  2) Sell the movie forward and have another studio claim it owns a Palme d'Or winning film from an already oscar winner who will probably be nominated this year again at the Oscars (not to mention with the amount of press this movie is getting, have a huge hit on it's hands). Plus, of course, see the relation between Miramax and Disney die a mangled, quick death.  3) Sit on the movie... forever !!! Never distribute it or, simply, give it a mild direct to video release, thereby limiting it's profits and destroying any shot at the oscars (even taught Disney can give it a limited run in a few theaters like Miramax did with Jet Li's "Hero", thereby securing an oscar nomination, but not necessarily an oscar win). And, the Miramax - Disney relationship is strained forever, but still lives on.   Note: They can also hold on to the movie and release it after the elections when both George and Jed will no longer be holding office (we can only cross our fingers and hope).   Which ever way you look at it, Disney is F U C K E D. I would say to Disney, go for choise # 1 cause money makes the word go round and an oscar nomination (that has a clear chance to turn into an oscar win) is a must for your crown. Plus keeping an ACE like Michael Moore happy and in your trenches is very important for busyness. You don't want to give away success to your rivals no matter how much they are willing to pay.  This is the best way to go, except Disney will probably go with choise # 3 which has them holding off the movie or taking it straight to video (with the limited run for the Oscar guys). Why? It's the best of both worlds. Also, limits it's impact power. Miramax and Michael Moore would be "happy" (in a "At least the fuckers at Disney released the blasted him" kinda way). Still, don't surprised if Michael Moore moves to a better playing field and Miramax's top names start leaving in protest like rats running away from a sinking shit...erm...ship.   Btw, Moore says he is looking to get this movie in theaters during the election so that the American people can "do the right thing"... =;-D     urlLink Sailor Ecchi (A.K.A.

      (This is a Spanish reflection on the quality of life in Puerto Rico written by my best friend J.C. Hope you enjoy it.)   Calidad de Vida    La sociedad puertoriqueña cambia cada día que pasa, y la visión de ésta es relativa.  Muchos ven a la sociedad como una unida y alegre; pero en mi opinión no hay nada más lejos de la realidad.  A veces,  nos preguntamos por qué vivimos en una sociedad violenta y quizás nunca contemplamos nuestra calidad de vida cuando buscamos la respuesta.  La calidad de vida no es sólo los bienes materiales que tengamos, sino,  es también, nuestra cultura, nuestro ambiente y nuestra personalidad.  Como no ser violentos entre nosotros mismos, si actuamos violentamente en contra de aquellas cosas que son esenciales para nuestra supervivencia.  Dañamos el medio ambiente, somos capaces de arrojar la basura que tenemos en nuestras casas a la calle porque nos molesta, pero jamás y nunca pensamos a dónde irá a parar.  La realidad es que todo aquello que tiramos como el aceite de un carro, una nevera, lo que sea, daña el suelo, suelo en el cual quizás se cultivó una fruta que consumimos en un día de campo o simplemente el suelo donde juegan nuestros hijos o seres queridos. Contaminamos  nuestros cuerpos de agua, agua la cual después consumimos.  Aún si arrojáramos la basura a un zafacón, nunca nos cuestionamos qué pasará con ella.  Más bien, creo que nunca nos preguntamos qué es la basura.  La sociedad puertorriqueña es una de las que más basura genera, nuestros vertederos ya están llenos y a nadie parece importarle buscar una solución.  Los políticos siempre están muy ocupados pensando cuál nueva ley enmendar o qué nuevos fondos traer, pero no son capaces de resolver nuestros problemas, ni de concienciar a la gente de la realidad.  Tanta contaminación y mal uso de los recursos se podría evitar o por lo menos ser más leve, si reciclamos, si no echaramos al zafacón las botellas, latas, periódicos que ya no son útiles para nosotros.  Quizás no son útiles para nosotros, pero para salvar nuestro medio ambiente sí.  Realmente es útil, ya que en algún momento mudarnos de pueblo o hacer un vertedero nuevo no nos resolverá el problema.  Tenemos que ser una sociedad más consciente y entender que no estamos solos, que todo lo que hacemos como individuos tiene un efecto en toda la sociedad porque vivimos en grupo.  Somos violentos en contra de la naturaleza misma, y gracias a ella estamos vivos, pues el aire, ni el sol, ni la capa de ozono se fabrican.   Entonces, cómo no ser agresivos entre nosotros si somos agresivos con uno mismo.  Hoy día vivimos todos casi uno encima del otro y es sorprendente que jamás le dirigimos la palabra al vecino hasta que necesitamos algo o simplemente para discutir porque su carro está estacionado delante de nuestra casa.  Esta es la realidad para muchos, y es esta violencia lo que reciclamos.  Nadie enseña a guiar a nadie, pues realmente es algo que uno aprende por observación.  Durante todo el tiempo que estuve de pasajera, porque aún no tenía licencia de conducir, ¿que vi? Gente tocándose bocina por todo, gritándose improperios, en fin gente frustrada porque están en el tapón o detrás de una persona que guía lento.  Esa violencia yo la aprendí por observación y no es hasta recientemente que me doy cuenta.  Yo también hice esa violencia parte de mi vida para vivir en esta sociedad.  Como unirme a una intersección sin prácticamente tirarme encima del carro de al lado, porque aquí casi nadie es suficientemente cortés para cederte el paso.  Hoy día me doy cuenta de esto y ahora que yo también guío, y alguien me toca bocina, no reacciono.  Por todo, te tocan bocina.   Para mi, eso ya perdió el sentido o simplemente es una agresividad que reconozco como normal, ya que la violencia es nuestro estilo de vida, es la forma que la sociedad puertorriqueña ha adoptado como medio de vida.  ¿Qué calidad de vida es esa?  Vivimos en una sociedad de ruido y contaminada.  Tengo la experiencia personal de tener una avenida justamente detrás del patio de mi casa.  Al principio me era difícil, pero ya no  escucho los carros a cualquier hora del día y de la noche, y tristemente esta es la realidad para muchas personas, no solamente para mi.  Entonces, ¿es esto normal?  Comienzo a pensar que somos seres violentos porque dormimos sobre la violencia misma y ya es parte de nosotros.  ¡Cómo no ser violento en un tapón, si la noche anterior supuestamente dormiste tranquilamente, pero cuál fue la realidad!  Dormiste quizás con unos cuantos tiros, unas cuantas sirenas o bocinas sonando, y no despertaste, simplemente porque ya es algo normal en la sociedad puertorriqueña.  Muchos creen que la solución está en mudarse al campo o a la isla, salir del área metropolitana, pero nada más lejos de la realidad.  Ahora, cuando tomamos la autopista 52 para ir a la isla, sorprendentemente vemos urbanizaciones en medio de la nada, con una autopista de patio.  Como guiar confiado por la carretera de Guavate, o Carite si realmente vemos cosas nefastas, autos robados quemados, chatarra por dondequiera, no hay alumbrado, y ya el sitio deja de ser hermoso por la noche, porque los malechores se aprovechan para asaltarte ya que no hay nadie cerca, ¿qué calidad de vida es esa?  No importa a dónde vayas, es todo un ciclo. Irónicamente es la violencia una de las cosas  que reciclamos con mucho orgullo y parecemos no querer arancar de nuestra cultura.  Hoy día reflexiono a cerca de todo esto y llego a la conclusión que somos una sociedad violenta porque no tenemos una calidad de vida.  Ya no importa si vives en el campo o no sales a las discotecas, somos una sociedad y en algún momento tienes que hacerte sentir, ya sea para comprar algo en la farmacia, o en el supermercado  ¿Y a que te enfrentas?  A una violencia reprimida, que explota por necesidad para poder sobrevivir en la sociead. Todos tenemos la violencia en nuestro subconsciente, no importa que tan lejos vivamos o cuanto tratemos de alejarnos del ruido es algo que simplemente está en nuestra cultura. Solamente cambiará cuando todos estemos conscientes de esta enfermedad.  No es secreto para nadie que la mayoría de los puertorriqueños padecen de los nervios, son muchos los depremidos, bipolares, esquizofrénicos…., pero ¿a quien le importa?  La salud mental en Puerto Rico está  en el olvido y es triste porque ahí está la raíz de nuestro problema.  Al gobierno parece no importarle la salud mental de las personas, es más ni se les educa, solo proveen soluciones temporeras como quizás un aumento de sueldo, un nuevo carril reversible, un mejor plan de retiro y con esto de la sociedad se conforma.  El gobierno no hará nada si la gente no despierta, pues ellos ciertamente no buscarán soluciones mientras no se las exijamos.  Pero hoy, luego de haber reflexionado, me siento feliz, podemos tener una mejor calidad de vida si entendemos lo que realmente está mal, no hay mejor calidad de vida que la habilidad de pensar y ser consciente.  Con nuestras mentes podemos cambiar el mundo, si queremos  y no hay necesidad de ser violentos o mudarse de sitio.   El primer paso es reconocerlo, paso que no es fácil y no hemos hecho todavía, pero no pierdo la fe.  Hoy siento que tengo un poco de calidad en mi vida no importa lo que me rodee, ya que estoy consciente del verdadero problema, no voy a perder la fe porque yo puedo ser el ejemplo de mi vecino o mi amigo.  La cultura no es algo estático, es algo que cambia con el tiempo, pero ese cambio está en nosotros mismos, en nuestras mentes, no sólo en lo material o en  la tecnología.

      (This is a joke I received at my email. Enjoy.)  The  Story of 4 husbands...   Four husbands were sitting at the waiting room in a hospital waiting for their wives to give birth.   Soon, a nurse came out from the delivery room and told the first daddy: "Congratulations, you've got twins!". "Oh!..... maybe it's just a coincidence" said the daddy, "as I'm working at the Petronas Twin Towers".   Then another nurse came out of the room and told the second daddy: "Congratulations, you've got triplets!" "Wooow!, this is a coincidence too" said the second daddy. "I am working for 3M Corporation".   A while later, another nurse appeared and told the third daddy: "Congratulations! your wife got quadruplets" "Thanks God. Perhaps this is also a coincidence". "I work at Four Seasons  Hotel!".   Meanwhile, the fourth daddy-to-be was becoming very worried. All the 3 daddies asked him: "Why do you look so worried?".    He answered, "I work at Seven-Eleven!"    (P.S. Special thanks to Kavitha for the joke)

      From  urlLink IMDB :  Record Box Office in U.K. for 'Azkaban'    Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban captured the biggest opening-day box office in British history Monday. Opening on a bank holiday, the third film in the Potter series grossed an estimated $8.75 million, surpassing the previous record of $7.5 million set by the original film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in the U.S.) in 2001.The film had received lavish acclaim from British critics. Kevin O'Sullivan in the London Daily Mirror wrote: "If you're not a Potter fan by now you never will be. But for the millions of admirers who remain under this bespectacled hero's mesmerizing spell, The Prisoner of Azkaban delivers the goods in spectacular fashion." James Christopher in the London Times singled out director Alfonso Cuarón (Y Tu Mamá También, A Little Princess) for particular praise. "Cuarón's appointment to this franchise is the most inspired Hollywood gamble of the year. He is not a proven director of blockbusters or indeed sequels, but any misgivings about his ability to bring home the lucrative bacon evaporate frame by lavish frame," he wrote. Those sentiments were echoed by Anthony Quinn in the Sun: "A great move, I think, was to bring talented Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron in to direct the movie. He gives it a depth and sense of danger the others didn't have (and, obviously weren't supposed to have)." Similarly David Gritten observed in the Daily Telegraph: "The third in the Potter series, released on Monday, has a new director, the Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, and it marks a huge stride forward. The Prisoner of Azkaban is far more visually striking than its predecessors. Finally, here is a film that does justice to [author J.K.] Rowling's soaring imagination."

      From  urlLink IMDB   As camera cell phones become ever more sophisticated, a hint of things to come for movie studios may be contained in a report from Japan's Asahi Shimbun today (Tuesday) in which owners of bookstores in Tokyo complain about "digital shoplifting." The report indicates that visitors to the stores are using their cell phones's camera capability to copy magazines and pages of books. Yoshihiro Maruoka, the operator of one bookstore in Tokyo's Kanda district, an area lined with bookstores, told the newspaper, "If this keeps up, our books won't sell." Cell phones with full video capacity are expected to be marketed within two years and are likely to be so small that anyone using them in a theater would probably go undetected.

      The King of Rock vs. The King of the Dead   Hey ya !!! Just wanted to drop a line and tell you to pick up this neat little flick directed by  urlLink Don Coscarelli , the cool cat that directed the Phantasm movies. It is currently available in DVD. This little gem has been getting a lot of exposure in some indie festivals, mostly comedy and fantasy. Problem is that the whole distribution of the movie has been handled by Coscarelli's pocket, which is why very few folk have actually had the luck of watching this movie. It has toured several places, building up a cult following. Of course, this is mostly due to Bruce Campbell's performance that is getting rave reviews all over the place.   The movie is about an old, forgotten Elvis Presley ( urlLink Bruce Campbell ) that finds himself in a rest home in East Texas. Apparently, the real Elvis has not died, having exchanged lives with an Elvis  impersonation in order to give himself an opportunity at a new, better life. Of course, now that has come and gone, he is full of bitter regret and frustration. His only friend, a black man that claims to be the real JFK ( urlLink Ossie Davis ). They both realize that something strange is going on in the rest-home when old people start dropping off suspiciously. Apparently, their is an Egyptian cowboy zombie on the loose who is sucking the souls of their fellow residents.   While slow, this movie is very campy and extremely entertaining. Mostly thanks to Campbell's flawless and hysterical performance as the King. Plus, their is a lot of humanity and sadness in the character. It never gets ridiculous. You never see him as a joke. Just as a man who has made so many mistakes, he now has time to reflect on his failures, while he slowly waists away in a rest home.  There is a lot of social critism here in the way we treat and discard our old.     Basically, it's that type of movie that doesn't quite fall into specific genre categories. It was comedy, horror and drama. It's sad that a movie with such independent spirit and energy (especially considering that this is a "geriatrics-fight-Egyptian-cowboy-zombie movie") would never receive a proper theater distribution. Now that it has received a most excellent DVD release by the people at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, this movie will have the chance to reach a wider audience who will ponder why trash always hits the cinemas, yet meaningful movies about old people battling mummies get overlooked. =;-)   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      I actually went to see The Day After Tomorrow at the movies and arrived really late for RAW tonight. I just saw the final 20 minutes of the program with a long, crappy Trish heal promo and the main event that was... Kane VS. Eugene. WTF !!!!  Man, did I get a strong feeling this show sucked big tine. I am currently reading the forum posts at a wrestling site and it looks like everybody said that yesterday's show was a mess. Looks like I was lucky, especially considering that The Day After Tomorrow ended up being a pretty good and entertaining movie.   I will talk a little about what I saw and know about the show, but before I do, I would like to comment on the current rumored Great American Bash PPV Card. Apparently, this will be a Smackdown only PPV. Just read carefully, stop and think about it for a sec...  (here we go !!!)   WWE Championship Bull Rope Match Eddie Guerrero vs. JBL in a Bullrope Match for the WWE Title   Handicap Match The Undertaker vs. The Dudley Boys   United States Championship John Cena vs. Booker T for the WWE U.S. Title   Flag Match Rob Van Dam vs. Rene Dupree   Rey Mysterio vs. Mark Jindrak   WWE Tag Team Championship Rico & Charlie Haas vs. Chavo Guerrero & Chavo Classic   Kenzo Suzuki vs. TBA   Divas Beach Competition Dawn and Sable vs. Torrie and Miss Jackie (sub for Sable would be Jacqueline)    (okay, where back)  Did you have time to reflect on this card? Yep, you guessed it. SUCKS !!! Judgment Day part deux !!!! Okay, boy and girls, let's reflect on the low buy rates Judgment Day had...  Still, I'm probably being too harsh, considering that this is a better card that Judgment Day (but not by much).  Now, let's look at this card in detail.   The WWE Championship Bull Rope Match has some potential, since it's a gimmick match and could very well work. I'm pretty sure Bradshaw and Eddie can pull this one off, but it has to be something spectacular and, please, Eddie... be very carefully with those blade jobs cause you could actually die from that.   The Undertaker vs. The Dudley Boys is a Handicap Match? Oh, I hope this is just a rumor and not reality. What type of feud is this? And weren't RVD and Rey Mysterio feuding with the Dudleys?  The Undertaker is too overrated. Granted, that Hell in a Cell match that he had with Brock a few months ago (or was it a year ago, not sure) was pretty good. I am sure that the Undertaker can pull off a few good to decent matches, but against the Dudley Boys in a Handicap Match? Boring!  John Cena vs. Booker T for the WWE U.S. Title... first of all, what is a "U.S. Title" and how does it differ from the "WWE Championship"? The answer is that it's a less prestigious title. A consolation price. A paper title. Something to use in a storyline when you have little or no imagination to write a decent plot for key wrestlers. Booker T should win this title letting John Cena to move on the greener pastures feuding with Eddie Guerrero for the WWE championship. Heck, not that I want Booker T to win a worthless title, but if he looses, what the hell is he going to do? Retire, Mr. T. Retire.   Rob Van Dam vs. Rene Dupree... wasn't Rene Dupruee feuding with John Cena? Last I heard, this feud could have lasted one more month. That was quick! Still, this could be a good match if worker right. Could help either man.  Rey Mysterio vs. Mark Jindrak... Okay, this match might be good. In fact, could actually be an interesting opener. I like Mark Jindrak. I think he has some potential. Still, isn't Mark Jindrak a little too green for someone like Rey?  Rico & Charlie Haas vs. Chavo Guerrero & Chavo Classic for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Chavo Classic isn't exacly Eddie Guerrero. Also, Rico is a good wrestler and is being wasted in a dumb gimmick that is holding him back. Poor Charlie Hass... he probably misses Shelton so much. Still, this will probably be an entertaining match, but I believe that they could put out a much better match if they were all given freedom to cut loose and wrestle.   Okay Kenzo Suzuki against a "to be announced" opponent. One word for you... Mordecai. Hey, where is he anyway? I hope this wasn't another failed experiment on the WWE's part.  Divas Beach Competition... T n A (no, I don't mean the other wrestling federation). Yay !!!  Doesn't sounds like a PPV you would order, right? Maybe let someone else buy it and watch it with him. RAW's Bad Blood PPV sounds much better. A little more about that in a while. Now, onto RAW...  Like I said, I didn't watch the whole show. Just the last few minutes. Watched the Trish promo which went too long. She and Tomko had taken over the Jericho's  Highlight Reel. Now, sure, Trish makes a better heel, than a face, but I have this thing against promos that last more than three minutes and have redundant information (*cough* *cough* HHH *cough*).   Oh, I read we were treated to a long HHH promo in the show. Damn, I feel so broken up and bitter about missing that... NOT !!!!!   Anyway, Jericho comes out for an @$$ whipping... his. So, we have Tomko and Jericho for Bad Blood.  Then, the main event which, btw, I actually taught it was going to be the Highlight Reel cause it was taking so long. The main event was Kane VS Eugene and, boy, was this such a wrong thing to do on the WWE's part. Kane is feuding with everyone and their sister right now. Kane overload. Please, stop, WWE. You've done so much to ruin this character in the fan's eyes. No more.  Hell, I read Kain didn't even interact with Lita on this show. Now, wasn't the preview of the RAW show yesterday indicating something big was going to happen in this storyline with Kain and Lita? April fools !!! April fools !!! ...erm... Wait a sec? Doh !!! It's not april !!!   Now Kane goes after Eugene. Why? This hurts them both. Eugene is over with his stupid gimmick. Feed him some "lesser" wrestlers. Have him actually get involve with a feud that last a month at least. The coach? Please! Garrison Cade looks like an idea candidate, except that he is an up and comming star that could actually never live down the fact that he lost to a character with Eugene's gimmick.  I can tell you that the person who plays Eugene is very talented and has a lot of potential, but the gimmick is holding his back. He can't wrestle with his full ability cause he has to look retarded and confused in the ring.   On the other hand, when Eugene "gets mad", which is something that gets a big pop from the fans, we see a lot of potential in the gimmick. Reminds me a little of when Hulk Hogan gets bashed around and gets pumped and the crowd goes wild.   Still, this hurts both characters. Kane can't afford to lose cause it will damage his reputation (what's left of it). Eugene can't loose cause then the gimmick goes to hell and fans loose interest. What do you do? Quick DQ ending on the main event. Yay !!!  Benoir comes in for the save after Kane gets disqualified and starts betting up on Eugene. Afterwards Eugene and Benoir hug. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  Again, thank God I went to see Day After Tomorrow and I didn't see the rest of this show.   Okay, I read that we had a very good La Resistance VS. Edge and Benoir match, in which the tag titles changed hands. Now, what I dislike about this is that I don't like thrown together tag teams. Edge and Benoir were a thrown together tag team. They should have lost the tags weeks ago, but kept them for God knows what reason. In fact, the fact that they had the titles, but were feuding against other people in single competition proved to be a distraction. Now, they loose the titles for no apparent reason cause there isn't a single worthy tag team in RAW except the guys who won the titles. Who is going to feud with them? Hurricane and SHIT for the hundredth time?  Moving on, Randy Orton VS Shelton is what I hear was a pretty good match. Some interference to make way for their match at Bad Blood, which I think is the match that is going to put these guys on the map (even taught Randy Orton's last match with Mick Foley probably did that already).  Victoria VS. Jazz... I love Victoria, but I see that she came out with that silly jiggle she calls dancing. People hate it WWE !!! Please make her a psycho bitch again. She needs to have personality so that people will rout for her.  Also, Matt Hardy fought someone, but it was just an excuse to see Matt and Lita kiss. No kane. Boring. No more to say here.   SO, that was the show. No wait! There was also a long HHH promo. Weeeeeeeeee !!! And no Shawn Michales. What a great way to promote their hell in the cell match.   Taking into account all this, I will give the show a - D. Since I didn't see the complete show I found it fair to deliver this grade instead of a - F. I'm a just man.   Well, before I sign off, let's look at the current Bad Blood card:   Hell in a Cell Match - Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H   I think that these guys have chemistry. Been working together for a long time. And, make no mistake about this, they will make each other look like a million bucks. Not to mention they are probably going to break each other in half. I expect a good match from this pairing.  Heck, these guys can probably do a bra and panties match (which is one of the only gimmick matches they have yet to do) and deliver an excellent match (even taught it would probably be the most brutal and bloody    On a sad note, originally it was taught that HHH was going to loose this one cause he had to go make a movie or something, but according to reports Shawn Michaels is expected to take some time off following the Bad Blood PPV. This is because his wife is about to give birth to their second child.  Congratulations to Shawn Michaels.   So expect HHH to win and hold out till Summer Slam when Shawn Michaels returns to challenge him again for the hundredth time.    Chris Benoit vs. Kane  So sad. Kane has been discredited so much. I am not looking forward to this match, even though they are probably going to step up this match in the same way JBL and Eddie Guerrero did for their match at Bad Blood. I know Kane can do better than what he has been doing. Win or loose, I hope Kane shows everyone why he used to be a big hit as the big, red machine.   Tyson Tomko vs Jericho  Oh Lord, please don't turn this match into a handicap match (If I hear this has become a Jericho vs. Tomko & Trish match, I am going to puke).   Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton  Like I said above, this is their time to shine.    Edge vs. Batista  I have a gut feeling that this match will help Batista if done right. Edge has had a lot of good RAW matches to get his street credibility as an "A" class wrestler again (his first match since returning from the injury against Kane did shit for him. Very lame match). This match should see these two put up a good show, but if you are expecting Batista to win (yeah, right), don't hold your breath.  Victoria vs. Gale Kim  I really want this match to deliver cause I like these two. I think that they can pull off a good match if they have their hearts and minds focused. Hell, they have the potential to show people that women aren't just for T n A (again, I'm not referring to the rival wrestling company). But, please, Victoria, no more dancing.   There is probably going to be another match announced. Probably Eugene vs. Coach (or preferably Garrison Cade). Maybe we will be treated to another Hurricane and SHIT vs. La Resistance match. Yuck.   sadly, nothing for Matt Hardy except. Damn, who did this guy piss off backstage?  Well, that's it for me. Gotta go back to work. I expect to watch the whole show next Monday. Hopefully, it will be a better show now that we are near the Bad Blood PPV.  Oh, and I will leave you with the following question... What the fuck happen to Tajiri?

      Yesterday I had an extremely odd dream. I rarely have them. When I do they are usually nightmares or strange. Last nights was a bizarre one, so I decided to post it up here. There are some parts that I don't recall, but I will try to write everything I remember as accurately as possible.  I recall going to a restaurant at night to get some food. It was like a dinner buffet type of thing. Outside, in the parking lot, someone has chained two puppies to a hydrant. One of the puppies was brownish red, the other white. They barked and became playful everything someone passed by. I had seen the puppies, played with them a while and then went into the restaurant.   From the restaurant, I spied on the puppies wrestling each other and generally doing what puppies do best. My mom was there and she was sitting beside me. I asked her if the owner could be in the restaurant and she told me that there could be a possibility (which, in this dream logic, would explain why the puppies where there).   I started debating what to do. I felt that if I left the restaurant and they were still there, I would take them for my own. Then I thought that the owner might not want them and left them there so someone would pick them up and give them a good home.   When I left the restaurant, I walked toward the place where the puppies had been chained. They were no longer there. I felt sad, but thaught that where ever they went, they were probably better of than being chained up to a hydrant.   The dream quickly changes location and now we find ourselves in a dirty looking warehouse in the middle of a getto. There is this big group of people waiting to get into the building. There are these large men serving as bouncers. The bouncers where keeping people out of the warehouse and letting a few walk in. Someone was being beaten pretty badly next to me, but I'm not sure by whom.   From this point on, I am not directly participating in the dream. I see everything and I am following someone that seems to be me, but older and Canadian. No, he doesn't look or act Canadian. Nobody mentions this fact either. He just is. In the dream I know he is Canadian. Just like that. Weird, huh?  For some strange reason this Canadian guy who is supposed to be me manages to be let in and is told by someone there that the "big boss" is granting select people gifts for their loyalty. He also mentioned that the Canadian guy was to choose a gift when he meet the boss, but had to then put a blind fold on and choose the gift at random. Also said that it was late and there might not be that many gifts to choose from anymore. The Canadian guy is led to a room, where he is left a lone with the boss...  It was Quentin Tarantino !!!   How the fuck he got into my dreams I will never know.  Quentin gives the guy a blind fold, which he puts on. Quentin leads him toward a night table and has the guy open and search the bottom drawer. There are only two things there: a box wrapped in brown paper and some skies. The guy chooses the skies, but, after taking off the blind fold, asks what's in the box. Quentin laughs and the guy picks up the box and opens in slighly to reveal: the puppies !!!   !!!  They were not moving and the guy turns to Quentin and asks how he could have done something like that? Quentin shrugs and answers that puppies are a great gift, but they often suffocate when packed into gift boxes.  The guy goes mental and screams and Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino takes the box, pulls out the puppies and throws them out a window and onto the crown outside.   The Canadian guy starts beating Tarantino with the skies and then, after Tarantino is a bloody mess, jumps out the window after the puppies.   He lands on top of somep people that start carrying him over they're shoulders. There is mass chaos. It now looks like a rave than a group of people waiting in line. There is drinking and drugs. People start poring alcohol on top of each other.   In the middle of the crown, a father and his son look on and point at the ravaged puppies, also laughing.  The Canadian sees that people in the crown are tearing the puppies into pieces and laughing. He gest angry, pulls a lighter and throws it on the people. The lighter makes contact with the alcohol and everything burst into flames.  The flames quickly die down and there is this big, black spot where the people where supposed to be. They were all burned to ashes except the father, son and the Canadian guy who looked angry at them.  The father picked up his son and told the Canadian guy that they were lucky that they didn't drink or else they would have caught on fire and died like everyone else. They start to leave, but the Canadian guy grabs a bottle of alcohol, pours it on the father and child and lights them too on fire.    !!!!!!!  The child screams "Daddy !!! I'm on fire", as they both quickly burn and disintegrate into ashes. The Canadian guy smiles, turns and walks onto the sunset.   End of dream    Pretty weird, shocking stuff, huh? My dreams tend to be crazy stuff like this. If anyone knows exactly what this dream could mean, feel free to post it up in the comment area.

      Lucas Revising First 'Star Wars' Pics? (from  urlLink IMDB )   Rumors are spreading on Star Wars fan sites on the Internet that George Lucas is making numerous changes to his original three films prior to their release as "the Star Wars Trilogy" on DVD on Sept. 21. According to Video Store magazine the changes include digitally changing the faces of at least two characters to make them gibe with those in the recent films. Steve Sansweet, head of fan relations for LucasFilm, described the set as versions of the films "as George Lucas sees them today." Some fans have expressed disappointment that the original films, as they were presented theatrically, will not be available on DVD.

      Today I was watching a news clip at CNN where they spoke about outrageous email ploys to get people's money and identity. That made me recall one of those emails I had received before that was pretty far out. I've received many fraudulent emails. Heck, I receive at least 12 of these emails on a daily basis. Yet, this one is the best I've received so far. Funny stuff. Here goes...  **********************************************************************  Email:    sarahguei@... (full email withheld by Sailor Ecchi) Subject:  URGENT  HELP   From Sarah Guei, Dear Sir/Madam,  Compliments of the season! and a prosperous newyear.This mail may be a surprise to you because i have being deprived of the privilege to meet you before now, also you do not know me in person, but before I tell you about myself I want you to please forgive me for sending this mail without your permission.  My name is Sarah Adidi Guei, 26 years old and the daughter of the late military Dictator of COTE D'VOIRE ( Retired Brigadier General Robert Guei) who was killed in a political crisis which led to war in my country(Ivory-Coast).My father, mother and two of my younger brothers were killed by some soldiers believed to be loyal to the government because of my father's objection to some certain policies of the present government. I was lucky to have escaped with a brother who is the last child of the family that night because we were visiting a family friend in another city far away from our home.  I have to go into hiding with my Little brother (JUNIOR) for some days before arrangements were made for us to leave Ivory-Coast for the Netherlands seeking political asylum.  Before we left for Netherland ,I visited our home where my mother and my two junior ones were killed in our village and during the search for some documents in my father's room I came accross some vital documents and the key to a secret vault in the house.I took the key and went down to where the vault is and there I discovered a (metal trunk box) which were carefully hidden. With the aide of the documents I was able to open the box only to find out that the trunk were full of money in hundred dollar bills. I could not count the money because I was very shock to see it and again it is too much for me to count but the documents that I recovered in my father's room which led me to the box put the money at $148,000,00.00(Fourteen million eight hundred thousand dollars).  I locked it back carefully and arranged for the box to be moved with me through the help of some family friends to Abidjan the capital city, where arrangement was made for the transfer of the box with the help of a (Diplomatic courier) in abidjan to a Financial security firm in the Netherlands for safe-keeping.I did not declare the content of the box to the firm,I only declare it as family valuables.  At this moment I am living in the netherlands with my brother(Junior) as of now, the code of conduct bureau of offense in my country does not permit me and any member of my family to: (a) Operate an offshore account. (b) Own a foreign company. This is my primary aim of seeking your assistance to secure this money for me and my little brother.  I wish to meet with you if you can make a trip to The netherland, Never mind about your expenditure it will be taken care of though I may not be able to send some money to you right now but i you will be compesated as soon as this business i finanlised and not only that,I am ready to offer 20% of the money to you for your assistance. It is not that I am paying you but as a sign of appreciation for every of your effort in this business.  Please I wish that this assistance be treated highly confidential, it will interest you to note, for security reason, i will appreciate if you reply to our private mail:  sarahguei1978@... (full email withheld by Sailor Ecchi)    While Waiting to hear from you, your swift correspondence would be appreciated.  yours respecfully,  Sarah Guei.

      The following is from  urlLink WWE.com :  IS IT ALL OVER? May 31, 2004   Apparently, Lita lived up to her end of the bargain after giving Kane an answer of yes to his mysterious demand. As a result, Lita thought it was over, whatever "it" is. While RAW fans still don't know what "it" is, it appears to be far from over, despite Kane's claims that "it's all over." Will we ever find out what "it" is or was? Tune in to Monday Night RAW to find out.   Now that a Hell in a Cell Match has been announced for Bad Blood, pitting Shawn Michaels up against Triple H, will these two bitter rivals be able to bottle their emotions until then? If their pasts are any indication, fans can expect to see one of these icons try to gain the upper hand prior to Bad Blood. But who will it be?   All of this and more, as the road to Bad Blood continues on Monday Night RAW at 9/8 PM CT on Spike TV.

      Well, another WWE PPV is coming up. This time it's RAW's Bad Blood, which will be playing on Sunday. Here are my thoughts on the current card.  We have seven matches, instead of the usual eight. This is actually a good thing. I've noticed recently that most PPVs try to go for the bigger is better approach. The result is that we get all these five to eight minute matches that don't satisfy. They seem rushed and poorly paced. I think that the key here is time management. We have the main events that need time to work out an interesting match, so everything else must be shorten or rushed. This is not a wise idea, given that you also have all those silly back stage segments that you add to give the show a little more entertainment value (not to mention give the talent and crew time to prepare for the next match).   The fewer the matches, the more time they have to develop. The more time to develop, the better the match. The better the match, the better the participants of the match look. This is something the WWE needs. The roster at RAW is currently stacked with young talent that has a lot of potential. The WWE needs to showcase this talent.  Smackdown used to be a real showcase for young stars. The cruserweight division there has a lot of talent, plus it was a means to introduce these talented wrestlers to the masses. Currently they have been pushed aside and forgotten. The division a joke. The show has moved from a solid wrestling show to a mediocre sports entertainment show (something that was really hurting RAW a while back before the final roster changes).  RAW has improved greatly and this PPV is an example of it.  I don't know how the card is going to be distributed. I will just place the matches as I see them listed in the  urlLink Bad Blood official page .   Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman   I really doubt this is going to start the PPV. This has the potential of being a fun and, most likely, funny match. Still, it's an entertainment only match. Sure, some wrestling moves and some drama will probably be mixed in, but it is not a good way to get your crowd interested in the show. You need something to build on a crowd to make them rowdy and loud. A hot crowd is always a plus in a PPV and the only way to achieve this is to get them emotionally involved in the show. A good opening act is crucial for this, not a filler match played for fun.  I expect this one to be light and funny, given that the "Coach" plays his heel character in a tongue in cheek manner. He needs to be like this cause he isn't really a wrestler, even taught he looks a little more buff than usual and it's apparent that he is getting some sort of training behind the scenes.   The Eugene gimmick has worked out really well. The crowd loves it (or at least it seems like they love it). This gimmick had disaster written all over it and, remarkably, it has worked out really well. Mostly because this guy is really talented. Not in wrestling, even taught it is clear that he is very comfortable in the ring and has his share of cool old school moves. He is very good at playing the crowd, which I think is why his character is getting big pops and raves. Having a lot of funny segments that hit the mark on RAW have helped.   Heck, that's how the team of GoldDust and Booker T had its start. A while back they had these great, solid comedy moments. The crowd loved them. They were fully behind their tag team, but the WWE dropped the ball and missed a solid opportunity to push these guys to the top and keep them their. Their tag team reign should have lasted at least half a year or so. It was that damn good. They had chemistry together. Not many tag teams have that in the WWE.   Anyway, I expect Coachman to cheat and maybe win, even taught the only way I see this happening is if William Regal turns on Eugene, which I feel is not going to happen anytime soon. Expect Garrison Cade to get involved. Maybe even Johnny Nitro, since he lost to Eugene last Monday's RAW and should be looking to get some revenge. Now, what I would really love in this match is that Regal gets involved and starts kicking ass. Hey, I like the guy.   Also... maybe... Al Snow could make an appearance. Why not? Would make the match special, given that he is supposed to be Coachman's best buddy and commentating partner on Heat. That would be cool.  I guess, the logical thing is that Eugene wins. It's a bad gimmick that is turning out really well. This is weird, even for the WWE that has ruined sure fire gimmicks. A loss here, might put the gimmick in jeopardy. I'd say that it's in their best interest to keep the gimmick going and maybe put Eugene to feud with Garrison Cade, there by giving this guy some exposure. It's been a while since I've seen him on RAW.   Winner: Eugene   LA RESISTANCE vs CHRIS BENOIT & EDGE for the World Tag-Team Titles  Many people are guessing this one to be the opening match on the card. Benoit is wrestling twice this night, so why not get this first match over with and have him rest for his next match against Kain later. Expect Edge to be on fire since he is going to have to carry this match. The WWE will not want to have Benoit tiered for the main event. It's only logical that Edge will be the one with the most time in the ring. Benoit will probably get a hot tag here and nothing else.   Rob Conway of La Resistance is a pretty good wrestler. I know he will do his best in this match. His partner, Sylvian Greneir, is...well... green. Still, has potential. A match like this, especially against oponents like Edge and Benoit, will give him an opportunity to shine if he plays his cards right. This is an important match for La Resistance.   Expect La Resistance to retain. Possibly because of an incident between Edge and Benoit that will further fuel a feud between these two (or at least that's what the WWE is hinting that they want to do). A feud between Edge and Benoit could be gold if handled correctly. Edge VS Benoit for the  World Heavy Weight Title would be a great match at the SummerSlam PPV.   A win for the team of Benoit and Edge would mean shit, since these two are better off on their own and not saddled as a tag team. Plus, it will do them good not to win (again, taking into account their possible feud). So, you can bet that La Resistance will get the win here.   Winner: La Resistance   Tyson Tomko vs. Chris Jericho   This would be my guess as an opening match, even taught that the WWE probably isn't going to risk it since Tomko hasn't wrestled a formal match in a ring yet. If they go with this one and Tomko doesn't work out, that will only make the crowd cold and getting that energy back will be an up hill battle. On the other hand, you have Jericho which guarantees that this match will be pretty intense. At least on his part.  I see Tonko winning cause this feud just started and they really want to make Tomko look like a real menace (think Brock and Batista). Heck, last Monday you had a segment where he actually stood up to Kain, before Trish pulled them apart. So, if the WWE believes that this guy has potential, this will open the PPV.   The pressure here is on Tomko. He has to deliver. This is the match, his first actually, that will put him on the map or put him on the road to the Heat program.   Since Tomko is starting out, don't expect a clean win. Expect Trish or even an injured Christian to pop up and help out.   Winner: Tyson Tomko   Victoria vs. Gail vs. Trish vs. Lita   Victoria has had her reputation shot since she started silly dancing and loosing to Gail Kim. This would have been a great match between Gail and Victoria. Heck, they were building Gail Kim for the match. On the other hand, they forgot to develop Victoria, which was a very bad minus for feud. Then, this week on RAW, Gail looses to Lita and everything goes to shit. Trish and Lita are involved in other story lines that may or may not benefit from a title win here. Trish is a long shot. Being added to this match seemed more like an after thought. Her story like with Tomko, Jericho and Christian doesn't give her room to be a women's champion. Heck, since Tomko is most likely going to win thanks to her involvement, then it is logical that she won't win this match.  Lita might benefit a win in her storyline if Kain beats Benoit for the World HeavyWeight Title. This Monday's RAW, we learned that Kain was instrumental in getting Lita involved in this match. He told her that he wanted them both to win titles at Bad Blood. How romantic, huh? Anyway, Lita might win and Kain might loose to Benoit or maybe Lita wins and Kain looses. Maybe they both loose. Who cares? This is a dumb storyline that isn't going anywhere. I just feel sorry for Matt Hardy for being involved in it. Anyway, I hope the WWE has enough sense to keep the title away from Lita, even thought it looks like she could actually win because of this pathetic storyline.   Gail Kim should win. She has improved and has added several neat and flexible submition moves to her arsenal. She has been well developed as a heel in the past weeks. Why stop there? Have her feud against Victoria, Lita and Nidia (what happened to her, anyway?). Why not bring in Ivory to fight with her? Heck, have Molly turn on her and try to take the title from her? Same with Jazz and Trish. They would also like a shot at that title. What's the key word here? FRESH !!! Kim just got back from an injury. Trish and Lita have fought everyone and their mother. Victoria is a great female wrestler, but all that dancing and smiling hurt her character. I'd have Victoria loose and turn psycho again. That would be cool.  Oh, and no more three or four way women's matches, please. It hurts the credibility of the title. Just a clean, one on one match. I have a feeling that they are saving Victoria VS Gail Kim for SummerSlam. What's the problem? Gail Kim lost cleanly to Lita on RAW this week. So, how will this all fit in. It's not about being unpredictable. It's just that it's such a big mess.   Anyway, let's have Gail Kim win and feud with crazy, bitch Victoria (Not dancing fool Victoria). Damn, this whole new gimmick of Victoria dancing is like when Mick Foley became Dude Love. Just not right.  Winner: Gail Kim (even thought Lita will probably win the title so that Kain, when he looses to Benoit, can mess around a while longer in their stupid storyline)        Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton    this match has potential to be a star making match. These two guys are just inches away from the spot light. They both have shown that they can do decent to excellent wrestling matches. The old guys, in their own way, have passed the torch to them. What's missing? A four star match. Can they do it here? I'm pretty sure they can. Why? They are young, fast, energetic... No really big injury to stop them from cutting loose. Hell, they already enough wrestling experience between OVW and their work in RAW to prove that they aren't amateurs in the ring.   Sheltom Benjamin made a name for himself at Smackdown participating in the tag team aptly called "The World's Greatest Tag Team" (formally "Team Angle"). This was one hell of a tag team. Too bad they were split up too quickly. Still, Shelton can now enjoy a single wrestler's career. A career which has been given one hell of a boost since moving to RAW. It's a blessing to be able to say that you've beaten HHH several times.   Randy Orton is such an arrogant bastard. Perfect !!! An excellent heel. People hate him. Heck, my mom wants to kill him every time he watches wrestling on Spike TV. He has the look of a champion and the attitude to boot. When he first came in, he was forced fed to the fans. This hurt him as a face, but gave way to a sudden heel turn after his shoulder injury. Having him involved as a member of the Evolution stable helps. And he has milked it and done as much to keep from being displaced by Evolution's two real main starts: HHH and the great Ric Flair. Batista, on the other hand, wasn't as lucky, even taught it was mostly because he suffered several injuries that have kept him from the Evolution stable and being brutish and dangerously clumsy in the ring is never a good thing.  (Note: Batista has improved and is looking pretty good, but he has to work on that clumsiness. What's my proof? Anyone has seen Tajiri since their match on RAW?)  Another thing that has helped Randy Orton was his last match with Mick Foley, who put him over like he did a while back for HHH. That's one hell of a rub and Randy Orton ran with it, showing that he had the guts and balls (taking tacks on a bare back has to take some deal of balls, no?).  If all goes well and the WWE gives them it's blessing, then this will be their night.  Who will win? That is a real toss up. Depends on what the WWE has planed for them and the InterContinental title. I have a feeling that Shelton Benjamin will be feuding with Batista after this match (or at least after Randy Orton moves onto another opponent). So, I'm going to say that Shelton wins.   I'm guessing the WWE will want these two to continue their feud until Edge finishes his planned feud with Benoit and maybe have Shelton continue to feud with Batista or Kain.   I was just thinking that the main event scene is looking pretty good on RAW. Benoit, Edge, HHH, HBK, Kain (I have faith that the WWE is going to wise up and start using this guy correctly... yeah, right!)... Plus we have on the wings Randy Orton, Batista and Shelton Benjamin.   After this match, Shelton Benjamin and Randy Orton move into the main event scene. Which is good, cause HHH and HBK might take some well earn vacation time (and I have a feeling that after their Hell in a Cell match, they are going to need it).   Winner: Shelton Benjamin     Chris Benoit vs. Kane   The build up for this match was bizarre, given that more attention was placed on the Kain - Lita - Matt Hardy storyline. Then Kain turns against Eugene for a Benoit save that might have done more harm than good to Kain's reputation as a monster. The only interesting moments in this feud where in the beginning when Kain won the battle royal that gave him a contender shot at the title (even thought I've said that his winning the battle royal while being involved in another storyline was absurd... Actually, I still say it).   Benoit could pull off a main event match in his sleep. This guy is a wrestling machine. Kain used to be great until he was humiliated and crushed under HHH political grasps. This match could actually give Kain a second chance to prove himself worthy.   Heck, if the WWE decides to give Kain a win and have Benoit keep feuding with him all summer, it wouldn't be a bad thing. Only two things. Kain has to give 100% and prove he can be a wrestling monster in the ring and his story line with Lita and Matt must end. If not, have Benoit keep the title and let Kain feud with Matt (or, possibly, a returning Jeff Hardy).  Since Benoit will probably loose his first match of the night against La Resistance, given way to a rumored feud with Edge, then it's logical that he will keep the title.   Winner: Benoit   Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H   What can I say? I expect nothing short of a bloodbath. This is the match that will make or break this PPV. Giving these guy's track record, this might end up being one for the books. Also, these too seem to have an ego problem. That is one thing that will keep these two from underperforming this night. Also, supposedly, these guys are not going to be available for RAW after this match, which means that they have to really fuck each other up badly to explain their absence from RAW.  This will most definitely be HELL. The cell is just a bonus.  Winner: Hopefully, a very bloody and bruised HBK.    Well, that's the card. Looks pretty good... on paper. Usually, one thinks that there is no way the WWE can't fuck up something this "good" (sure, could be better, but for a Bad Blood PPV, this is a pretty good card). That doesn't mean they won't try. There is one match that has the potential to be entertaining (Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman), two to be excellent (Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H and Shelton Benjamin vs. Randy Orton), one to be really good (LA RESISTANCE vs CHRIS BENOIT & EDGE), two that are up in the hair (Benoit vs Kain and Tyson Tomko vs. Chris Jericho) and one filler match (*sigh* Victoria vs. Gail vs. Trish vs. Lita). This is much better than last month's judgment Day and, by the looks of it, it's going to be better than Smackdown's next PPV ("The Great American Bash").   I rarely buy PPVs, especially WWE PPVs. I usually wait for them on DVD. It's been months since I bought a WWE PPV DVD. Why? Cause they suck. They've been sucking for a long while now. Had expected to buy the WMXX dvd, but decided against it. I usually find other...erm... alternative ways to watch the matches that interest me. Nothing usually calls out "buy the WWE" anymore (except for the excellent Ric Flair and Mick Foley DVDs which I did buy and greatly enjoy). This PPV has "buy the DVD" written all over it. This Sunday I will read the results of the Bad Blood PPV and tell you if I am still interested in buying this DVD when it comes out on sale.   See you then !!!   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      (This is an email I received from a friend of mine at work.  It's a letter writen from a daughter to a mother. Read all the way to the bottom! How would you react to this note?????)   A mother enters her daughter's bedroom and sees a letter over the bed.   With the worst premonition, she reads it, with trembling hands:     "It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm telling you that I eloped with my new boyfriend. I found real passion and he is so nice, with all his piercings and tattoos and his big motorcycle.. But it's not only that mom, I'm pregnant and Ahmed said that we will be very happy in his trailer in the woods. He wants to have many more children with me and that's one of my dreams. I've learned that marihuana doesn't hurt anyone and we'll be growing it for us and his friends, who are providing us with all the cocaine and ecstasy we may need. In the meantime, we'll pray for the science to find the AIDS cure, for Ahmed to get better, he deserves it. Don't worry Mom, I'm 15 years old now and I know how to take care of myself.   Some day I'll visit so you can meet your grandchildren.    Your daughter, Judith    PS: Mom, it's not true. I'm at the neighbor's house. I just wanted to show you that there are worst things in life than the school's report card that's in my desk's drawer...I love you!"

      Here I am, back again, to give you the low down on Monday's wrestling show.   (Sorry for the delay in publishing this review. Had some probs yesterday)   Pretty good stuff, actually. But I wouldn't expect nothing less since on Sunday we have a Bad Blood, a RAW PPV. This show had to deliver and I think it did, with a few minor complaints.  Show started off with a number one contenders match between Lita and Gail Kim. The winner would go off and fight with Victoria for the Woman's championship. Pretty well paced match with some awesome submition moves by the very sexy and flexible Gail Kim. Lita was ok...  What's my gripe for this match? Lita won. WTF???? Haven't we seen weeks and weeks of development story between Victoria and Kim (actually, just Kim beating up people and Victoria silly dancing)? What happened here? Does the WWE have little faith in Gail Kim? She's hot. She is doing very well. Both Gail Kim and Victoria have the potential to put women wrestling on the map. What gives?  Victoria VS Lita for Bad Blood. Doesn't feel right. Heck, it turns out not to be right cause we later find out that the women's match at Bad Blood with be a four way match. WTF? What brought this on? This is the reason why the women's' matches are shit. They have no credibility.   Now, for Bad Blood we have Victoria VS Lita VS Gail Kim VS Trish  Another gripe. We were being feed two different storylines about women wrestlers that were not wrestling. These were the Trish - Christian - Tomko - Jericho and the Lita - Kain - Matt Hardy angle. One of the angles was working pretty well, the other (*cough* *cough* Lita *cough*) wasn't. So, now, without any explanation, they are combined and thrown together with the Victoria - Gail feud (which wasn't any better). This suck.   Next we had Batista VS Shelton Benjamin, which was pretty good. I taught Batista looked pretty good and powerful here. Had a lot of personality.  Funny how Batista, who was nothing less than a joke in the ring a year ago, has improved dramatically. This guy is starting to show a lot of potential. Not to mention that he looks very powerful. Having Shelton Benjamin as your opponent and being part of the Evolution stable hasn't hurt either.  The crowd was into the match. Shelton Benjamin looses the match when Randy Orton intervenes. An Evolution beat down follows, thereby setting up the Randy Orton VS Shelton Benjamin match at Bad Blood. Very good stuff (even taught the beat downs are getting really old).  Next Chris Jericho def. A-Train in a surprisingly interesting exchange. I had forgotten A - TRain was traded to RAW. I always forget to watch HEAT, so I hadn't seen the guy wrestler for RAW yet. Interesting how there was a pretty big stretch of time when we were forced to endure an elephant size push for this guy at Smackdown. Same push was given to Big Show, who took the opportunity and ran with it, making him a credible main event wrestler. A - Train didn't. Now he is jobbing on RAW.   On a side note, this Smackdown main event push was given to Hardcore Holly on his return with disastrous results. It is currently being given to Bradshaw which may or may not work. While Bradshaw is generating a lot of heat, it's not bringing in the numbers. And, sadly, it's making Eddie Guerrero look bad. And, boy, is Eddie trying really hard to make things work. It's not his fault the numbers are down. A year ago, Smackdown was the show to see. Now, it's become a sad joke.  Eddie Guerrero hasn't been the same since his match with Bradshaw at Judgement Day. All that bleeding really did a number on him. It's odd cause Eddie Guerrero has been a top class wrestler since returning a while back to the WWE. He worked hard, wrestled great and won every bit of the title push he has. Currently, he seems to be loosing focus. He has to get his head straight.   Apparently, Eddie got into an incident with the crowd of a show in Germany (the same place where a day earlier Bradshaw unwisely did some Nazi gestures to get some heat from the local crowd). This isn't the first time Eddie has gotten into problems with the crowd. I believe this is the third time since returning. He got into a fight because some dumb fan pored beer on him. Recently I heard that he fought with a fan because he threw something at one of his daughter's during a show. Oh, there was also that time where another dumb fuck entered the ring during a ladder match. That was live on RAW. Funny shit. Eddie took a swing at him. I believe it connected too. With Germany, this would be four times that he has gotten into a situation with the crowd. Granted, the first three times weren't really his fault. Even taught, one would stress that if he got mad at someone, he should try something different. Not just jump on the person and beat the crap out of him. If the WWE lets him do it several times, he'll just keep doing it and, eventually, it will ruin this fantastic wrestlers opportunities.  When Eddie Guerrero and Benoir won their respective brand's main title, it was taught that Eddie, and not Benoir, could have the potential to hold the title and the crowds interest till at least the end of the year. Also, Eddie didn't have to work with HHH. Now, the tables have turned. Benoir has been a big success in his title run. He is also giving an 100% and is putting on some good wrestling matches. Proof of this is that on Bad Blood he has two, not one, two matches! (A little more about that later)  I will say this, even with Benoir's successful run, the WWE might give us a curve ball and have Benoir loose his title at Bad Blood to Kain, so they can continue to feud until HHH is ready to step in and take his title back (even taught I think that HHH already proved what he set out to do; which is probably the reason that he is currently putting over up and coming talent like Shelton Benjamin).   I believe that Eddie Guerrero's reign as champion is  almost over. The sad part is that there is currently no worthy wrestler in Smackdown can make a credible champion beyond Mr. Guerrero. Angle has an injury and won't be wrestling much. Bradshaw... Please !!! Big Show is out too. Hardcore Holly is a joke. Booker T has had his credibility shot to pieces too many times. All the other worthy champions are in RAW... oh, God... No... The Undertaker... Nooooooooooo !!!  WWE... One person can save Smackdown. RVD !!! RVD !!! RVD !!! Give this guy a chance at a run for the title... Watch your ratings rise (bring on those ECW chants !!!).  Anyway, I digress. Back to RAW. Next match is...   A Handicap Match where La Resistance takes on Chris Benoir. La Resistance wins by disqualification when Edge gets involved. Benoir looked pretty bad in this match. Like if he was holding back. Guess the WWE taught that it would look bad if Benoir folded La Resistance by himself. Would hurt the teams credibility, which was pretty up after the win at Montreal. A win for the frenchies, even if it was a DQ, is a good idea, but why make Benoir seem so week.   Eric Bischoff comes out and announces that because of Edge's interference, we get La Resistance VS Benoir & Edge at Bad Blood. Yes, Benoir will have to fight twice at that PPV. If it was the Undertaker, I'd vomit. But Benoir is okay. Angle fought three times at one of the King of the Ring (The first two matches sucked, but the third against Shane McMahon was a really surprise; probably one of the best matches in WWE history due to the type of damage these two took).  Eric them makes another handicap match.  Kane & La Resistance VS Benoir & Edge to start... NOW !!! I actually love when the WWE does shit like that. Anyway, good match, but Benoir is made to look very week and, if that wasn't enough, they are starting to hint at a Benoir VS Edge match, maybe for the Summer Slam PPV. Not bad, but we've seen this crap before (*cough* *cough* Angle & Benoir *cough*).  I believe that around this part of the program, Bischoff announced that  Chris Jericho will battle the "Problem Solver," Tyson Tomko, at Bad Blood. This could be a good match.  He also announced the fatal four way women's match... Doh!  We have a segment with Kain confronting Lita. Kain tells her that he was responsible for given her a shot at the title (damn, and here I taught that the stupid WWE writers where the guilty ones). Lita tells Kain that he has said "it" was over and Kain responds that he lied. When they say "It", I believe they are referring to this stupid story line.   Expect either Lita (Grrr!) or Kain (Yuck!) or both (Bleh!) to win a title at Bad Blood.   Oh, and Uncle Eric also made a match with Jonathan Coachman going against Eugene at Bad Blood. Funny how Jonathan Coachman has an undefeated PPV record.   When Bischoff's assistant, Johnny Nitro, acted overly arrogant, Bischoff forced Nitro to take on Eugene with Nitro's job on the line. Now, this is very pointless. And, please, how many times have we seen this?   Anyway, Eugene pinned Nitro, so I guess he's fired.   Funny match, taught. The crowd really liked Eugene and, boy, does this wrestler know how to play the crowd! The other wrestlers should take note.  Last match of the night was Shawn Michaels VS Randy Orton. Great match. These two work pretty well with each other. Ended in a DQ. Boo !!! Anyway, they had to do this to set up the Shawn Michaels VS HHH in a Hell in the Cell Match at Bad Blood. I have a feeling that these two are gonna make it a very memorable and bloody match.  Great show. Good build up to Bad Blood. I'd say a B+ show (almost an A-). Good job! The show is back on track and this Bad Blood PPV sounds like a keeper.   I will be posting tomorrow my thoughts on the Bad Blood card. See you then.

      From  urlLink IMDB    J. Lo's Secret Wedding Revealed   Jennifer Lopez married Marc Anthony in secret on Saturday, after telling guests they were invited to a "beautiful" party at her Los Angeles home. Astonishing pictures British newspapers today show the couple, both dressed in white, holding hands at makeshift alter under a flower-covered canopy after walking down a petal-strewn aisle in the garden of Lopez' luxury Beverly Hills mansion. Vivaldi's Four Seasons was played by a string quartet as Lopez, 33, was escorted down the aisle by her dad David, wearing an ivory lace dress and Neil Lane jewelry worth $200,000. Latin crooner Ricky Martin later serenaded the couple and their 35 guests - who were told they were only invited to a "beautiful afternoon party". A friend says, "We had no idea that this was planned until we got a call to be at her home on Saturday. There are rumors she may be pregnant. She is certainly glowing and looked ecstatically happy." The union comes just five months after Lopez split from former fiance Ben Affleck - whom she planned to marry in a canceled ceremony last September - and just days after singer Anthony, 35, finalized his divorced from his ex- wife, and the mother of his three children, Dayanara Torres.   ***************************************  Sailor Ecchi says:  Jennifer Lopez once again proves that she can't do shit without a dick in her mouth. It's so tasteless the way this freaking woman can't survive one months without a man. Why do you insist in marrying people, "Lo"? Think you found true love? With Marc Anthony? Let's see how quickly he tires of fucking you and moves onto the next piece of meat.  Oh, and Mr. Anthony... Good luck marketing your new CD to the Latino community. I bet they'll really love you now that you divorced Dayanara Torres (an ex - Miss Universe winner who is taking care of your two kids) to quickly marry a slut (she should be called J.Ho not J.Lo).

Four matches have already been announced for Bad Blood: World Heavyweight Championship: Chris Benoit vs. Kane Hell in a Cell: Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels Intercontinental Championship: Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin Women's Championship: Victoria vs. Gail Kim   There will undoubtedly be more Bad Blood matches announced on RAW.   And what will the participants in the matches already announced have in store for one another on Monday Night RAW? Will Shawn Michaels be barred from the building again?   How will Eugene follow up on his victory (by disqualification) over Kane?   All of this and more, as the road to Bad Blood continues on Monday Night RAW at 9/8 PM CT on Spike TV.

      (This is an article a friend of mine sent me through my email)  La verdad sobre "el carajo"  La palabra "Carajo", ha llegado a tener un uso múltiple en todas nuestras sociedades hispanas y puede ser utilizada en muchas expresiones; inclusive con diferente sentido y según el énfasis que se le de, determinará su significado.    Carajo es la palabra, posiblemente más usada de nuestra lengua, y aunque los académicos no se han puesto de acuerdo para definirla, el carajo parece ser indispensable en nuestro diario vocabulario.    Según la real Academia de la lengua, "Carajo" era el nombre que se le puso al espacio ubicado en la parte más alta de los mástiles de las antiguas carabelas españolas. Era una especie de canasta, que servía como puesto de observación, desde el cual los vigías oteaban el horizonte en busca de naves enemigas, puntos de ubicación o lugares hasta donde querían llegar. Por otro lado, los marinos de aquellas épocas, asociaban al mástil y dicha canastilla, con el órgano sexual masculino.    En aquel lugar, el más alto del mástil y el más inestable de la nave, se sentía en mayor magnitud, el movimiento lateral realizado por un barco de vela, de acuerdo al movimiento del mar. El marino que era enviado a permanecer como vigía, luego de apenas un par de horas, bajaba totalmente mareado; lo que era considerado como un duro castigo y servía para dar escarmiento a quienes cometían alguna infracción a bordo.    De ahí parece surgir la expresión: "Váyase al Carajo", como interjección para expresar un desacuerdo con alguien. Pero igualmente, también se acuñó otra expresión: "Ese tipo está del Carajo", cuando algunos marinos, podían permanecer impasibles y tolerar sin mayores problemas los movimientos del barco, aun ante las peores tempestades.    De tal forma, poco a poco esta palabra, se fue convirtiendo con el tiempo, en toda una institucion por su multiplicidad de usos, con la que se puede describir posiblemente todo el espectro en el estado de ánimo del hombre; desde el negativo, hasta el positivo.    "Esto está más bueno que el Carajo". Define algo muy atractivo o agradable. Pero igualmente si se trata de algo que no nos agrade, podríamos decir: "Está más malo que el Carajo".    Si queremos acentuar la mediocridad de alguien muchas veces decimos: "Es más bruto que el Carajo"; pero a la vez podemos acentuar por ejemplo, nuestra admiración por una dama y decir: "Está más buena que el Carajo".    Si llegamos a una reunión y encontramos buen ambiente, expresamos: "Carajo, que buen tono" y si por el contrario no nos divertimos, entonces lanzamos un: "Esto está más aburrido que el Carajo".    Y así, podríamos seguramente llenar varias páginas, escribiendo una y otra expresión en la cual vaya incluida la susodicha palabrita: "Carajo"; pero podríamos dar lugar a que alguien reclamara y dijera: "Qué carajo es esto".

      Back again with another review. I will try to keep this one as short as possible and not try to change the subject as I always end up doing.  We start up with Kain confronting Eric and "asking":  for another shot at Benoit. Trouble is that there is already another number one contender for Benoit's title. This leads to Kain getting medieval with Eric's office. Nothing says beast or monster like beating on a coach, a TV and some plants.   Btw, it must suck being furniture in Mr. Bischoff's office. Last week, it was totaled by a fight between HBK and HHH. I recall it's not the first time the office has been rearranged by some out of control fight.  J.R. is in the ring and he asks HHH and HBK to come down, shake hands and end their feud once and for all. They do and are "about" to do so, when Eric interrupts and runs in the ring. Kain runs in after Eric and beats on Shawn Michaels.  There is this sick moment where apparently Kain used a chair to crush Shawn Michaels throat (or something like that). Shawn Michaels starts spurting blood from his mouth and he is rushed to the hospital. Scary stuff, even taught it was all clearly scripted. My mom became nervous and called me up. She watches the show at her house, but that disturbed her. She felt she almost had a heart attack. I had to explain to her that HBK needed some time off to be with his family, which is why they did that injury angle. She calmed down, but was still a little nervous. It was pretty violent, especially for basic cable. Don't know how stuff like that will help the overall image of the WWE.   Anyway, first match of the night is Lita and Matt Hardy vs. Trish and Tyson Tomko. Now, do you recall that I mentioned that the Bad Blood PPV was crucial for Tomko cause he had not fought in a ring up to that moment? Well, this would be his second match in the WWE, right? Actually, since this is live TV, that would make it his first on national television. Where am I going with this? Well, for starters, he has to try to look good. Blown spots don't make you look good. They make you look sloppy and silly.   Matt Hardy jumps from the top rope and Tomko catches him... and they both fall awkwardly to the mat. You fucked up! You fucked up!   Surprisingly, the crowd let this one pass. Just a few noticeable groans from the crowd.   Lita and Matt Hardy defeat Trish Stratus and Tyson Tomko, which does shit for the women's title and Tomko, who I believe (after two losses and an unimpressive debut as a wrestler) should go back to OVW for some additional training.  Hey, now that I am thinking about stuff that Tomko has done, I recall that when he first appeared in the WWE, he gave a boot to the head to Jericho and fell over. Damn, it's only a matter of time before this guy goes poof. Maybe that's why he lost this last match. Since he is a problem solver and he isn't solving any problems, then the WWE probably will have him loose to justify Trish firing him. Hey, I would do the same.  Another off topic thought related indirectly to Tomko. Remember Jon Heidenreich? Yeah, me either. Actually, I recall him popping up in RAW several times before being dropped to the Heat program. He was pretty big and strong, but extremely clumsy. I think he once almost killed Steve Richards with a poorly executed move of his. I've checked the WWE page and he is still in the roster. Probably still in Heat. This guy was impressive, but terribly green, which made him dangerous in the ring.   I recall also that Jon had a kid or some person he was protecting that was a big secrete. They never said who the kid was. Maybe it was Eugene? Anyway, the storyline fell apart and disappeared after people started complaining that the guy would eventually kill someone in the ring. I guess well never know who it really was.  Next, we have La Resistance def. The Hurricane and Rosey in Flag Match. Okay, you can start rolling your eyes now. How many times have these guys fought? Yep, hundredth of times. Why? Cause they are the only tag teams on RAW right now. The tag titles are shit. Might as well have the team of Gail Kim and Molly Holly take on La Resistance. At least they are a credible team. Hurricane and Rosey (SHIT)? Please! Send Hurricane to the cruserweight division on Smackdown, where he belongs. It's only the right thing to do. Also, please give Rosey another gimmick.  On the subject of total stupidity... Lita might be pregnant and what I am thinking is that the WWE will probably hint that the child is... Kain's.   !!! Okay... I won't comment on this, except to say that if I recall, hinting that Lita "did something" with Kain to protect Matt Hardy was a new or recent storyline. Man, that must have been one hell of a fuck!   With that, we go to Gail Kim and Molly Holly vs. Nidia (Wow, she it still alive) and Stacy Keibler. Actually, the match was better than I expected. Even taught not by much. Stacy is not a wrestler. Just some really basic moves. Nidia has too much breast to be a wrestler. No kidding. They seem to...erm...get in the way. It was a very bad idea to have then done. ON the other hand, Gail Kim is impressive. So is Molly. These two are the real champs of the division right now.  Victoria used to be a contender, but then she started silly dancing (or spasms, as other people in the net refer to her moves) and her credibility was shot down. Look, WWE, it's not that she can't be a face. It's just that you have to put meat on that idea. Develop it. Now, there is no way around it. Make her heel. Make her the crazy bitch she was once before. That's the Victoria we have grown to love. That will also balance out the division. We have the good guys (Lita, Nidia, Stacy, Ivory and Trish) and the bad guys (Victoria, Jazz, Gail Kim and Molly Holly). Wait a sec... Something's wrong? Okay, Stacy isn't a wrestler. Nidia isn't over with the fans and is not a credible face yet. Lita is in a storyline where she is now pregnant. Ivory has been gone from RAW for a while now (and is currently doing the WWE Expirience show). And Trish, probably the best known and loved women's wrestler, is a heel. Fuck !!! The women division is a mess. Who is left, Victoria and her spasms! WWE, quick, develop her into a credible face. Dancing and going down to the ring to smile and hug children is not developing her personality or character. Do something quick or you will be backing yourself into an embarrassing corner.   Anyway, Gail and Molly win.  Eric tells HHH that he will have the number one contenders position if he takes out Eugene next week. HHH smiles. Uncle Eric is evil... hahaha  Next we have Eugene in Jericho's Highlight Reel. Interesting segment with Evolution coming down to give presents to Eugene and try to trick him. All this seems so wrong, but the way the WWE is handling it, it seems entertaining. Makes you wonder what's going to happen next week.   Nick Dinsmore really plays this character well.   HHH indirectly threatens William Regal and Regal looks pissed. I am liking this very much. I've always liked William Regal. Not only is he funny, but he is a very good mat wrestler. Probably one of the best. Heck, he should be. He's been wrestling since he was 15 years old. This guy is the real think. Tonight he looked slender and stronger. Must be really working out. Can't wait to see him in the ring. Especially against someone like Ric Flair.  Anyway, the ending of this segment hints at a possible Jericho feud with HHH later on. Even taught I have a feeling that the next RAW PPV, Vengence, will be headlined by Benoit vs HHH (which would mean that the rumored Benoit vs. Edge might happen on SummerSlam).   Final match of the night was an elimination tag match, which surprised me cause it is odd that the WWE and Spike TV would allow this type of match to happen at the end of a program. It's odd cause elimination matches tend to take a long while (except if it's a cruserweight battle royal... *sigh*). Not surprisingly, the segment clearly went over the over run time period. We actually had at least 15 minutes extra of wrestling. That in itself should boost the show's grade average.   Chris Benoit/Chris Jericho/Edge defeated Randy Orton/Ric Flair/Batista in an excellent match. Started off slow, moved into the normal range for a RAW match, then, in the final 10 minutes of the match, exploded into an intense back and forth match that had people cheering and gasping at every turn. I must say that everyone looked great here. Especially Ric Flair. The man was on tonight. I swear, this guy must be immortal. There was a moment where Flair and Benoit started exchanging blows at the end that looked very painful, violent and angry. Ric really put a lot of himself here. And he kept himself toe to toe with the young guys. Solid work. So much so, that after he was eliminated, his chest was read and bleeding and he looked extremely tiered and week. A man his age shouldn't force himself like he did last night, but it was a hell of a showing. I still can't believe Ric Flair still has the right stuff in him. I've always been a fan of him, but it's not until the last year or so (maybe after the great match with HHH he had around a year ago) that I've seen Flair step up several notches in his game. It's like he's gotten a new lease in life.   All in all, the show was okay. A lot of sports entertainment. The beginning of the show and the ending were very good. The middle part is where it all came crashing down. Some good stuff, some bad. I'd say this show gets a B+ (mostly due to the great long match at the end). Oh, and Ric Flair rules.  Well, that's it for me. See ya next Tuesday with another review.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      Okay, tonight we're going to have the Fallout of the Bad Blood PPV on Spike TV. Sounds like it was a pretty interesting PPV. Didn't see it. Like I've said before, I never buy the PPVs. I wait for them on DVD and then decide if I want to buy them or not. I've totally ignored the last few PPV cause of the reviews they've been getting. If I am going to buy something, I have to make sure I am making a good investment. Smackdown's PPV (especially Judgement Day) are most definitely not a good investment. Which is sad, cause a year ago, I would gladly purchase a Smackdown DVD before I did a RAW DVD. Times have really changed.  Would I buy this PPV on DVD? Well, let's analyze the results.  We started off the night with La Resistance (World Tag Team Champions) vs. "The Crippler" Chris Benoit & Edge. From what I hear, it was your standard RAW match, which is sad cause the team of La Resistance really needed to be hot here. There was some teasing in relation to the possible Edge VS. Benoit feud, but it was mostly all bullshit cause eventually Kain interfered, causing a DQ ending which does shit for everyone. The only thing I see here is that this was mostly done to set up the match later with Benoit and Kain. I have a feeling that the WWE might also be thinking of using this loss to set up a feud between Edge and Kain for the next PPV. Might be a smart thing, considering that the rumors Edge heal turn is something so absurd, only the twisted, retarded minds of the writers of the WWE could come up with it. No kidding, it's a bad idea. Edge is an establish wrestler, but he isn't ready to go heal yet. Heck, his fans are not ready no see him turn heel yet. Such a thing can alienate a lot of people from the WWE.   Next up was Jericho vs. Tomko. Now, I've said this was an important match mostly because it was Tomko's first official match in the WWE. This is where we get to really know what type of wrestler Tomko is. Because of that, it's important for the wrestler and the WWE to make sure that he is introduced in a good way, as to make him a credible character. Was it a good match? Well, apparently no. The WWE dropped the ball yet again. Sure, some people mention that the debut of Tomko was much better than the debut of Mordechai on Smackdown. Still, that ain't saying much given that Mordechai beat his opponent really quickly.   Apparently, it was a normal match and, guess what, Jericho won! Now, people, please. Jericho's win does nothing for Tomko. Also, it was a short match. Should have been longer and, maybe, a DQ Finnish. A loss here, no matter how it was achieved, only hurts Tomko as a credible Wrestler. Not a good start.  Until now, the WWE has really dropped the ball for this PPV. Now, the next match sounded like it was pretty good, but this was something I was saying early last week.   Orton vs. Benjamin... This match had to deliver. Both of these guys need a classic match to put themselves in the main even scene. From what I hear, it was a pretty good match. Heck, a few people have even had the balls to call it the match of the night (totally ignoring the 40 + minute HIAC match). Was it a classic? No way. Is this a bad thing? Actually, no. In fact, it was probably a very wise idea once you take the time and think about it. First of all, everybody taught that Orton would loose tonight cause that would then have him move to feud for the World Heavyweight title (possible against Edge, Kain or even HHH before feuding with Benoit or who ever is the champion at that moment). Well, Randy won, so he gets the keep the title a while longer. This is a clear guaranty that this feud will be extended a few more months, which means that there will be time for both Orton and Benjamin to really make this a great feud and build for a climactic ending. This is much better and works to set both of them up for the main event.  I've liked Randy Orton's recent storylines. They have all helped him become more of a credible wrestler. These feuds have lasted very long, but have had interesting endings which, in turn, have given the IC title some prestige. A longer, more aggressive feud between these two young talent would be golden.  This match, apparently, had a few blown spots which people didn't like. Possibly cause both participates where nervous. I would be too. This, like Tomko's match with Jericho, are key matches that make or break a wrestler's career in the WWE. While flawed, it did its job and created interest in a longer, more exciting match. SummerSlam, anyone?  Now, here is where we go back to being a shitty program. The Women's four-way... Look, I didn't see the match, so I can't bitch about the quality of it. I can only talk about the ending with Trish winning the title. WTF??? Her appearance in the match was an after taught. It didn't make sense in the first place to be added here. This should have been a match between Gail Kim and Victoria. The WWE had built up Gail Kim really, really well. But their weakness was Victoria. Not Victoria's fault. They didn't find a way to develop her and her feud with Gail Kim in a competent way on RAW. Which is probably why they started adding more pussy to the match. Look, just because you don't know how to develop a story, doesn't mean you have to shit on probably two of the best female wrestlers on your roster. It's just plain stupid.  Anyway, Trish wins because... actually, I don't know why. It's a mystery. Did Trish's storyline really needed her to win this title? I mean, there was some build up for Lita to win to add something to her bizarre storyline with Kain. A win for Lita here and a loss for Kain tonight would have probably made more sense, even taught I would still be mad cause that would make a fool out of Victoria and Gail Kim, who should be fighting for this title.   Who is Trish going to feud for the title? Hopefully, Gail Kim and Victoria. Trish is probably one of the most consistent female wrestlers among the group (well, no. Molly is, but she has seemed to drop out of radar). But Trish is a heel now. And the WWE seems to have something against having heels feud with heels. So, that leaves only Lita, Victoria and Nydia (who seems to have vanished from the face of the earth) to feud here. What a mess? Well, looks like Lita VS Kain (with Kain as guest referee) for Summer Slam.   Actually, come to think of it, this might actually be an interesting match if everybody who has been involved in with the storylines for these two get involve. Would be funny to see Lita beat the crap out of each other, with Kain as referee having to contend with Christian, Tomko, Jericho and Matt Hardy trying to get involved in the match.   Then again, maybe not.   Next was Eugene vs. Coachman. I started reading what went down in this match. Funny stuff. Looks like the WWE is actually pulling this gimmick off like a bandit. It's working. It's actually working!!! Weird!!! Bad gimmick working. I should start preparing for the end of the world.  what's the trick here? I'd go with the fact that the guy who plays the "Eugene" character is really doing a good job at acting out the part. The crowd seems to love the character. Heck, they even chant his name!!!  There must be a lot of guys scratching their heads in the back about this.  Coach sounds like he helped make this match a fun match. People hate the Coach. Incredible. He has really made himself into a funny and interesting heel. This guy is pulling of his character very well and it being rewarded with more appearances. Hell, he's earned it.  Eugene wins. Weeeeeee !!!  Now, for the two main events.  Benoit vs. Kane seemed to be better than people expected. Actually received some nice reviews. I feel like Kain has the potential to do much better than what is being handed to him. This is proof of it. Benoit wins.   Now, boys and girls... what you all have been waiting for. A nice, sweet stroll... INTO HELL !!! Yep, it's Hell in a Cell, baby !!! And, from what I hear, it was a blood bath. Yeah, baby !!! I expected no less from these guys. They had to deliver here with all the hype. Did they do it? Well, they sure bleed a lot. Some say it was disappointing. Others say it was good, but not the best HIAC by a long shot. One things for sure, both participants beat the crap out of each other. There was a lot of intensity in the bout. Which is something both these guys generate even in their sleep. I think that the main complaint is that this isn't something we've never seen from these guys before. It's a classic back and forth beating until both wrestlers are dead or dying. All of their matches are like this. Nothing new to the formula, except the HIAC gimmick and, apparently, they focused more on the classic back and forth beating than covering new, innovative techniques using the cell.   Maybe it's best. Both of these guys are have been fighting with intensity with horrible nagging injuries. Hell, Shawn Michaels has a bad back that was considered a career ending injury a few years back. These two guys really are the best of the best and, once again, they proved it. But maybe the act is getting a little old for these battling giants. Still, I have no doubt that this was one hell of the match and, at 45 minutes, it had to be.   The only bad part about this being a long match is that it took time away from several matches that could have used those extra minutes to develop a better story inside the ring.  HHH won, there by assuring another one of his "I'm the best" rants tonight on RAW. *sigh*  Well, that was the show. It wasn't a total loss. From what I've read, it seems that it was a much better show than Smackdown's Judgement Day PPV (which isn't saying much). Sounds like the live crowd loved the show, even taught some reviewers claim that the audience came out as dead on TV. Some people that where actually live there claim that this is totally untrue. I have a feeling that the crowd was indeed hot. It was a good card and people knew it (even taught the WWE managed to fuck several things up that probably hurt a little the mood of the crowd).  Anyway, I'd say I am most definitely buying this PPV when it gets to DVD, which is probably one of the highest compliments I can give the WWE. Like I said before, if it seems like a bad investment, then I will totally ignore the product.   Let's see if tonight the WWE can pull off a good RAW. Bad Blood was pretty hot and there were a few matches that have potential to carry over a lot of story into tonight's show. Hell, I would want to know where the fuck the WWE thinks it's going with the Trish winning the title thing. It's so stupid, I actually want to find out. Only time will tell. Also, what the hell are they gonna do now that Lita and Kain both loss. Where will they go now? Preferably to hell, but I think that would be asking too much. Also, maybe Eugene can start feuding with Garrison Cade tonight. I don't expect to see Shawn Michaels cause he has to sell the beating he received at Bad Blood, plus he has to take some time off to be with family. I do expect HHH to talk, talk, talk, talk and talk some more until the cows come home. Tonight we will probably see more about the rumored Edge VS. Well, just have to see.   See ya tomorrow for another RAW review ;)   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      Well, here we are again, with another review of RAW. I haven't posted in my blog for a few days due to a lot of work I have been handed down. Too much stress. Today is no different. Also, I am working on another post which is very big and I have yet to finish it. I hope to have that one done later today.   I will try to keep this one as brief as possible. It was an okay show. Could have been better. The problem is that when you focus on the entertainment aspect of the show, but neglect the actual wrestling, the show becomes uneven, slow and stupid. This was the case tonight. Also, the wrestling wasn't great. More on that later.  Show starts with The Rock. Good start. Funny. Came out to a huge ovation. Wow, people love this guy. Especially in Florida. This guy has so much talent behind the microphone. Good start.  I'm pretty sure this is going to spike Mr. Tito's ratting for the show.  Anyway, Rock rips on everyone and their mother, literally. Randy Orton comes out and gets his ass handed back to him, thereby establishing a possible future feud between the stars. Maybe, Wrestlemania XXI?  Rock gets thrown out of the building for being rowdy. Of course, we've seen this shit before, but it's still nice to see the Rock, even if the WWE is recycling stuff from the last couple of years.  We go to a match for the Women’s Champion. Trish Stratus (with Tyson Tomko) defeats Victoria in a so - so women's match. Nothing to phone home about. My only gripe is that Victoria still insists on wiggling to her crappy new music. Sure, she didn't go into the full rutine,  but the intent was there. I guess people in the back must have screemed: "Don't do it, Victoria!!!"  Anyway, Victoria needs a new personality. I used to like her. No, it's like I don't know her anymore. Someone please bring my favorite psycho bitch back.   Question... someone dressed as a woman stood outside of the ring and seemed to try to defent Victoria from an after match beatting by Trish and Tomko. It was a man, baby!!! It looked a little like Steve Richards. Oh Lord, not another gender confused wrestler. I just hope this is a way of developing this new Victoria.   Okay, Regal complains to Eric about his mystreatment of Eugene in an interesting back stage segment, which leads uncle Eric to book Regal's first televised match in several years with none other than Mr. Feud-With-Everyone, Kain. And, of course, a beatting followed. I was very sad cause I was really looking foward to a real match, but when Kain was anounced as the oponent, I knew where the WWE was going. Anyway, helped further the tension for the main event. No William Regal for the night to defend Eugene from HHH.  I will comment that regal looks buff and actually looked fast in the little moment where he actually had some offence against Kain. I guess we will have to wait till next week for something better. Maybe Eugene and Regal VS HHH and Ric Flair? That would make me happy. I really want to see Flair and Regal fight against each other. I think these two, with their combined experience in the ring, can pull off something special.   Okay, next we have Randy Orton and Batista against Edge and Chris Jericho. I actually fell asleep with this match. Not because it was boring (even thought it seemed like a standard RAW match between these guys), but because I was terrible sleepy. I have been taking some cold medicine because I think I'm coming down with something. Of course, the match helped a little.  Missed when Jericho was taken out of the match. My mom told me today that it looked pretty ugly. When I woke up, I recall watching Edge being beatten by Batista and Orton and I though: "Where's Jericho?".   So, Orton and Batista win and Edge is left in a bloody mess.  I'm not sure if Jericho's injury is legit or a work. Since I didn't see it, I can't say if it was or wasn't. My mom said it looked very nasty. But then again, my mom almost died with HBK's injury last week and that was most defenetly a work.   After this, we had a segment with Kain telling Matt Hardy that Lita's baby was actually his. Funny stuff, but not in the intensional sence. Lita can't act. The last few weeks it was a sad thing watching her try to act. Now, it's just plain funny. She tryed, thought.  Matt storms off and Lita follows...  Lita: "Wait!" Matt: "Is the baby mine?" Lita: "It could be..."  Hahaha I liked that line, actually.   After that, we get Triple H VS Eugene. This was actually a well developed main event. What I liked is that it really felt like a story was being told. Some pretty funny humour and excitement in the match. Mostly because the audience is reacting to this storyline in such an increbidle way. They are eatting it up. Bizarre! Anyway, interesting match, mostly played for entertainment. Probably one of the better entertainment matches. HHH was a real sport here. Benoit gets involved as HHH gets ready to beat the crap out of Eugene with a chair. Benoit cleans house, but accidentally clocks Eugene with the chair. Pedrigre to Benoit and Evolution stands triumphant again.   So, the match ended in a no contest.  There are some rumours that there might be a Eugene VS Benoit VS HHH at Vengence. Oh, please !!! Eugene is an experiment. A successful experiment, but an experiment none the less. The WWE has to tread carefully. Fans enjoy the segments and matches with Eugene, but will turn against the gimmick if the WWE tryes to push it down our collective trouts or actually gets Eugene into a serious main event.   The show was pretty lame. The main event was cool and the Rock's appearance in the beginning was awsome. The rest of the show just didn't work. I'm giving the show a C-. I am being generous because of The Rock. This show should have been more a wrestling show if the main event was going to be an entertainment match. If the show insisted on being more entertainment than a wrestling show, the main event should have been a serious main event. So, this was an uneven show. It would have helped if the middle match (Edge and Jericho VS Batista and Orton) would not have turned into a handicap match. Also, Edge feels stale. He was more exciting on Smackdown. Then again, against oponents like Benoit and Angle, even a mop could turn in a four star match.  So, if you missed this show, you didn't miss much except some story advancement.  Well, thats it for today. See ya next tuesday.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      (From the  urlLink IMDB )  Marlon Brando, the legendary actor whose performances in A Streetcar Named Desire, The Godfather and Last Tango in Paris made him one of the most important screen actors of all time and whose larger-than-life persona offscreen dominated his later years, died Thursday at an undisclosed location in Los Angeles; he was 80. According to Brando's attorney, David J. Seeley, the cause of the actor's death was being withheld because the actor was "a very private man." The most famous proponent of Method acting and considered by many to be America's finest actor, Brando paved the way for a new style of acting in the 40s and 50s, first working on Broadway, where he created his first signature role as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. He made his screen debut in 1950's The Men, which was followed by his Oscar-nominated re-creation of Kowalski in Elia Kazan's film of A Streetcar Named Desire. Riding his sudden superstardom, roles in Viva Zapata, Julius Caesar, The Wild One and On the Waterfront followed, the latter of which won him his first Oscar. Once he became a true icon in the late 50s and 60s, he branched into directing (1961's One Eyed Jacks) and a troubled, bloated adaptation of Mutiny on the Bounty, where his need for perfection (and infatuation with the south Pacific) put the movie over budget and over schedule.   That film marked the beginning of a string of failures in the 60s, and by the early 70s the actor's star seemed to have faded. However, it was a little gangster film in 1972 called The Godfather that catapulted Brando back into the spotlight, and his phenomenal turn as mob boss Vito Corleone earned him a second Oscar – which he notoriously refused, sending an actress dressed in Native American garb to the Academy Award ceremony to reject the award with a diatribe against the wrongs done to Native Americans by the U.S. He courted even more controversy with Bernardo Bertolucci's X-rated Last Tango in Paris (though he grabbed another Oscar nomination), and appeared in both Hollywood projects (Superman, for which he received a record salary at the time) and award-winning films (appearing as Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's troubled masterpiece Apocalypse Now) through the 70s. Sporadic film appearances marked the end of his career, including The Freshman, A Dry White Season and Don Juan De Marco, and his later years were dominated by scandal, when his son, Christian Brando, shot and killed the lover of half sister, Cheyenne, at the family's home; Christian was jailed and Cheyenne committed suicide five years later. Legal fees rumoredly drained the actor's fortune, and contributed to the stories of Brando's bizarre offscreen antics. He lived in seclusion for the past few years, and most recently was the target of yet more rumors to be published in an unauthorized biography (one of many). Details about funeral arrangements were not immediately forthcoming.   --Prepared by  urlLink IMDB  staff

      Howdy:  You might be wondering what's with all the Bush jokes. I hate the guy, so decided to put up some neat jokes about him. Besides that I've been working on several items for my blog, but I've been so swamped with work, I haven't had time to finish any of them. Proof of this is my recent  urlLink Fangoria  article. While I've published it and the article is finished, I still need to do some work on it. I am linking the names of the movie to their entry in the  urlLink Internet Movie Database .   I like doing this because when I write about a movie, I probably don't add too much info on it due to limited space. Some of the stuff I write is pretty long and if I add more info, it becomes never ending. This way, people can follow the link and get more info on that particular movie.   Someone suggested that I should just like the movie directly to  urlLink Amazon  and maybe earn some cash in the process. I have a pretty good job and I really don't need to do this. I prefer people get a link that gives them more information on the title, not a way to purchase the title.   I will, on the other hand, be making a horror DVD shopping list. I will do this nearing October where there is much more interest in buying horror films than in summer. There I will add links to both Amazon and ebay so people can acquire those movies. Even then, I will avoid joining any money making programs. I'm not in this for the money and, again, my day job pays pretty well.  Next item on my list is to watch several movies I have bought. I recently purchased  urlLink Zatoichi  ( urlLink Takeshi Kitano ),  urlLink Anna in Kung Fu Land ,  urlLink Silver Hawk ,  urlLink Protege de la Rose Noire ,  urlLink Warriors of Heaven & Earth  and  urlLink Drunken Monkey . I bought all these movies on DVD for the incredible price of $47 (including shipping and handling). Well, at least I taught it was good.  The Silver Hawk DVD came damaged. I was going to return it for an exchange, but yesterday I found out that it would cost me more than what I paid for it to send it back. So, I decided to keep it. It's playing but the inner ring is scratched. Still, I'll keep it and, if I see that it's good, I'll buy it again. Problem solved.   Of the films that I bought, I've only been able to see Protege de la Rose Noire and Zatoichi.   Protege de la Rose Noire was very disappointing. Had it's moments, but it's just to silly and uneven. It's also surprising that it's a  urlLink Donnie Yen  film, yet it doesn't have any real martial arts except two scenes which, frankly, where played for laughs. Donnie Yen did pretty well choreographing The Twins ( urlLink Charlene Choi  and  urlLink Gillian Chung ) in  urlLink Twins Effect , which is why I really was looking forward to this movie. Total let down. Not even  urlLink Ekin Cheng  was enough to save this movie.  Takeshi Kitano's Zatoichi is something totally different. This movie really blew me away. It's no surprise that  urlLink Miramax  is trying to release this gem of a movie in the summer. I hope they do and I hope it gets a big audience. While slow, it features first rate performances, a witty script and some awesome swordplay and gore that will make splatter hounds sit up and take notice. It's no surprise that this movie has done pretty well in several international film festivals. I've hear people talking about this movie left and right and, now, I know why. Don't walk, run and pick up this movie on eBay, or be sure to see it on opening day when it slides into theaters (if it gets into theaters, Miramax is no inconsistent with dates and oriental releases).  A side note, you can also try to pick up the great  urlLink Azumi . Another  excellent swordplay movie that is nothing less than a breathtaking epic. My only gripe with this movie is that it has a lot of bloodshed, but very little gore (unlike Zatoichi which, while a smaller movie, has both in spades).  urlLink Ryuhei Kitamura  ( urlLink Versus ) such restraint in this movie, but it works, letting the performers out shine the violence. Worth getting but, beware the Chinese release of this Japanese movie. The DVD is buggy.   I've also recently bought the Operation  urlLink Operation Scorpio  and  urlLink May  DVD. I haven't see Operation Scorpion yet, even thought I did see the trailers and it looked sweet from a martial art's fan point of view. I did see May. What a fucked up movie !!! I loved every single frame. Fangoria has been raving about this little movie and Angela Bettis, who plays the main character, has been winning people over left and right. She is brilliant in this movie, which makes me even sadder that it didn't out shine 28 Days Later for horror movie of 2003. 28 Days Later is good, but not great. It's not great because it's not original. May is great because it is original. It is disturbing and well made.   On the personal side of things, I am working on a horror screenplay with my best internet friend. She is from Singapore and we meet up on a daily basis and hammer out ideas of the script. And, boy, is it coming out real scary. When we finnish, we will shop it around and see if it gets made. I am betting it will !!!  Also, looking forward to watching wrestling on Monday. The show has gotten better. A few months ago it was Monday night trash, now it's work in progress, but with potential. Enough reason for fans to stick around, as long as it improve and the WWE stops feeding it's fans bullshit.  Oh,  urlLink Spider Man 2  took in $40.5 million on its opening day to set a record for a Wednesday debut. I hear it's very good. Heck, it even has a high rating at  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  (about 95% last time I checked). I plan to see this movie on the weekend, even though that people are rushing out to see it and it might be wise to keep some distance until the madness dies down. When I see it, I'll let you know what I though of the movie.   Well, that's it for me. Time to look for more Bush jokes. Till the next time we meet.    urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      Bush's Tragedy  One day, President Bush visited an elementary school. All the kids were so excited to get to meet the President. He began to talk to them and asked them to define the word ''tragedy.''  "Well," one girl replied, "If my mommy ran over my dog, Rover, that would be a tragedy!"  The President smiled at the little girl and said, "No, sweetie. That would be an accident! Can anyone give it a try?"  A little boy sitting across the room raised his hand and said, "I know! I know! If our bus driver ran off of a cliff and killed everyone!"  The President shook his head and said, "No son. That would be a great loss! Doesn't anyone know of a good example of a tragedy?"  A small girl raised her hand and said, "Well, Mr. President, if you and Laura were in Air Force One and it was hit by a missile and blown to smithereens, most people would think that that was a tragedy!"  "Very good," he said. "And what was your reason for that answer?"  "Well," she said, "It would not be an accident and it sure would not be a great loss!"

      Bush Goes For A Jog   George Bush was out jogging one morning along the parkway when he tripped, fell over the bridge railing and landed in the creek below.  Before the Secret Service guys could get to him, three kids, who were fishing, pulled him out of the water. He was so grateful he offered the kids whatever they wanted.  The first kid said, "I sure would like to go to Disneyland." George said, "No problem. I'll take you there on Air Force One."  The second kid said, "I really need a new pair of Nike Air Jordan's." George said, "I'll get them for you and even have Michael sign them!"  The third kid said, "I want a motorized wheelchair with a built-in TV and stereo headset!!" George Bush is a little perplexed by this and says, "But you don't look like you are injured." The kid says, "I will be after my dad finds out I saved your ass from drowning!"

      Show and Tell   Little David was in his 5th grade class when the teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living. All the typical answers came up -- fireman, policeman, salesman, doctor, lawyer, etc. David was being uncharacteristically quiet and so he teacher asked him about his father. "My father's an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer's really good, he'll go out to the alley with some guy and make love with him for money." The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly set the other children to work on some exercises and took little David aside to ask him, "Is that really true about your father?" "No," said David, "He works for the Bush administration, but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids."

      George W. Bush's Intelligence Quiz   While visiting England, George W. Bush is invited to tea with the Queen. He asks her what her leadership philosophy is. She says that it is to surround herself with intelligent people. He asks how she knows if they're intelligent.  "I do so by asking them the right questions," says the Queen. "Allow me to demonstrate."   She phones Tony Blair and says, "Mr. Prime Minister. Please answer this question: Your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or sister. Who is it?"   Tony Blair responds, "It's me, ma'am."   "Correct. Thank you and good-bye, sir," says the Queen. She hangs up and says, "Did you get that, Mr. Bush?"   "Yes ma'am. Thanks a lot. I'll definitely be using that!"   Upon returning to Washington, he decides he'd better put the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the test. He summons Jesse Helms to the White House and says, "Senator Helms, I wonder if you can answer a question for me."   "Why, of course, sir. What's on your mind?"   "Uh, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother or your sister. Who is it?"   Helms hems and haws and finally asks, "Can I think about it and get back to you?" Bush agrees, and Helms leaves. He immediately calls a meeting of other senior senators, and they puzzle over the question for several hours, but nobody can come up with an answer. Finally, in desperation, Helms calls Colin Powell at the State Department and explains his problem.   "Now look here Colin Powell, your mother has a child, and your father has a child, and this child is not your brother, or your sister. Who is it?" Powell answers immediately, "It's me, of course, you dumb ass."   Much relieved, Helms rushes back to the White House and exclaims, "I know the answer, sir! I know who it is! It's Colin Powell!" And Bush replies in disgust, "Wrong, you dumb ass, It's Tony Blair!"

      Bush, Einstein and Picasso at the Pearly Gates   Einstein dies and goes to heaven. At the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter tells him, "You look like Einstein, but you have NO idea the lengths that some people will go to sneak into Heaven. Can you prove who you really are?"   Einstein ponders for a few seconds and asks, "Could I have a blackboard and some chalk?"   Saint Peter snaps his fingers and a blackboard and chalk instantly appear. Einstein proceeds to describe with arcane mathematics and symbols his theory of relativity.   Saint Peter is suitably impressed. "You really ARE Einstein!" he says. "Welcome to heaven!"   The next to arrive is Picasso. Once again, Saint Peter asks for credentials.   Picasso asks, "Mind if I use that blackboard and chalk?"   Saint Peter says, "Go ahead."   Picasso erases Einstein's equations and sketches a truly stunning mural with just a few strokes of chalk.   Saint Peter claps. "Surely you are the great artist you claim to be!" he says. "Come on in!"   Then Saint Peter looks up and sees George W. Bush. Saint Peter scratches his head and says, "Einstein and Picasso both managed to prove their identity. How can you prove yours?"   George W. looks bewildered and says, "Who are Einstein and Picasso?"   Saint Peter sighs and says, "Come on in, George."

      (Thanks to Milagros for the joke)  Llegan dos mujeres al cielo y una le pregunta a la otra:   - Cómo te moriste?   - Congelada.   - Ay, que horror!!! Debe haber sido horrible!... Cómo es morir  congelada?   - Al comienzo es muy feo: primero da escalofrios, después los  dolores en los dedos de las manos y los pies, después todo  congelandose poco a poco... Pero, luego vino un sueño muy pesado y  perdí la conciencia...   - Y tú, cómo moriste?   - Yo? De un ataque cardiaco... Estaba desconfiando que mi marido  me engañaba..... Un dia llegué a casa mas emprano... Corrí hasta el  dormitorio y él estaba en la cama viendo television... Desconfiada,  corrí hasta el sotano, para ver si encontraba alguna mujer  escondida, pero no encontre a nadie... Corrí hasta el segundo piso,  pero tampoco vi a nadie... Subi hasta el desván y al subir las  escaleras tuve un ataque cardiáco y caí muerta...   - ¡¡Oh!!, que pendeja... Si hubieras buscado en el congelador, las  dos estariamos vivas...

      (Thanks for the joke, Milagros)  El Pavo  El marido llega a casa a las seis de la tarde y dice a su esposa:   - Cariño, tengo una reunión de trabajo a las diez de la noche, pero no voy a ir... ¡Me parece que están abusando de mí!   La mujer, preocupada por él, lo convence de que el trabajo es importante.   Entonces, el marido se va a pegar una ducha para estar listo, y piensa:  - Fue fácil engañarla.   Como toda mujer que se precie de serlo, cuando el hombre entra al baño, revisa todas sus cosas: billetera, maletín, bolsillos del traje, etc. y encuentra un papel con el siguiente texto:  - Mi amor, te estoy esperando para comernos el pavo con salsa blanca del que hemos hablado.   La mujer coloca el papel donde estaba y, cuando el marido sale del baño, se la encuentra tumbada en la cama toda fogosa, semidesnuda, escasamente cubierta con una negligée transparente y en una postura muy sensual.  El marido se pone como loco, no pierde tiempo y hacen el amor como en los viejos tiempos...   Cuando terminan, el tipo, medio muerto, se queda dormido. Cuando va llegando la hora de la 'reunión', la mujer lo despierta, pero él no quiere saber nada de la reunión aunque, finalmente, ella lo convence.   Al llegar a casa de su amante, el marido, aún cansado, le dice:  - Cariño, he trabajado tanto hoy que sólo tomaré un baño y descansare un poco.   Al entrar al baño, la amante -como toda mujer- revisa los bolsillos de su pantalón y encuentra un papel que dice:  - Ahí te mando el pavo, so puta... La salsa blanca quedó en casa.

      Okay, quick review on yesterdays show. Have to get back to work, so I don't have much time to go into detail. Show was pretty good, even thought I feel asleep several times during it. Not that it was  boring, even thought most of the stuff that was shown was recycled material. Most new fans won't notice, but older fans will. I think that the WWE is trying all this old stuff so that they can real in the new fans like they did the old fans. But most of this stuff isn't as effective now as it was before. So, the new fans don't care and the old fans feel cheated for getting the same crap over and over again. A shit, by any other name, still smells the same.   Show starts with Evolution calling out Eugene. Eugene pops up and HHH, to the shock and horror of the other members of Evolution, makes him an honorary member of the stable. Of course, we all know this is bullshit cause The Game is evil and all.   William Regal comes out to confront HHH and reveal his dastardly plot to cloud Eugene's mind, but is meet with accusations when The Game reveals that Regal originally took the job of looking after Eugene in exchange for receiving his job back as a wrestler. Also, HHH reminds Regal that at first, one of the conditions for the job was that he make Eugene fail.   Regal tries to explain, but HHH convinces him otherwise. Now, Eugene is confused. Oh, the drama !!!  Anyway, Eric comes out and makes a match between HHH and Regal with Eugene as guess referee.   Don't know where all this is going, but it's looking pretty good and interesting.   We get out first match: Jericho and Edge VS Batista and Randy Orton. Yes, it's the same match as last week, except that this week Jericho managed to finish the match in one piece. The good guys win in a better structured match than last week's. Of course, that isn't saying much since Jericho was knocked out several minutes into the match and it became a handicap match.   I must say that Batista has improved in the ring and is looking really good.   Next we have, if I remember correctly, more Lita sobbing about screwing Kain. I guess Lita and Kain never heard of a little thing called a condom. Stacy is in the segment, but nobody cares.   Funny how the net reports that the WWE writers don't even know where this segment is going. Like you couldn't tell...  We get another segment with Ric Flair confronting HHH about letting Eugene enter Evolution and HHH admitting that this is all a ploy to use Eugene and, in the process, destroy him.   I hate to say this, but HHH is finally growing on me as a villain. Before, he just seemed annoying. Now, he seems fresh and new. Looks better too. Also, his matches have improved. This is mostly because he has started to sell other people's moves and actually make the young talent look good. I think that HHH doesn't have anything else to prove. Using backstage politics, he's molded himself as one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the WWE. Did he win this honor? No, he cheated and used his influence (fucking the bosses daughter helps with things like this) to reach the top and stay there. In the process, he's buried the reputation of Kain, RVD, Booker T and Scott Steiner (of course, this isn't saying much).   At least now, he is putting over people and actually making them look good. This is the HHH people want to see. Too bad that it was at the expense of other people.   We get the Regal VS HHH match, which was short, but I liked very much. Regal has always done well in the ring, but before his injury he looked like he was going through the motions, almost sleepwalking, when he fought in the ring. Before he came back, he promised more energy and determination. I guess he knows that this could very well be his final run before his health collapses. And, by the looks of it, he is going the distance this time around. He seems stronger, agile and more determined.   I liked what I saw in this match. Regal looked pretty good for a man his age. Very convincing too. Then again, the new HHH is doing wonders now for the talent. So, both put on a decent, short match that showed a lot of promise in the newly returning Regal. Like I've said before, I would love to see a real match between William Regal and Ric Flair.   But when I say real match, I mean no Evolution interference, nor a short time limit for the match. At least 15 to 20 minutes of old school chain wrestling and Ric Flair being the dirties player in the game. I am sure that real wrestling fans will find much to like here.  Match ends in a DQ as Eugene spots Regal with some brace knuckles that Ric Flair threw to HHH, but Regal intercepted. Eugene is very disappointed in Regal (Lita should take acting classes from this guy! Oscar! Oscar!). HHH pushes Regal into Eugene, which results in Eugene going mental on Regal. HHH and Ric Flair laugh as they taunt Regal and drag an out of control Eugene backstage, while remarking that Regal had in coming. Regal looks on with anger.  This, my friends, is drama. I like it very much, even though, like the Lita angle, I have a feeling that the writers don't have a clue of where they are going with this. Still, it's turning out pretty well. Eugene is angry at Regal and doesn't realize that HHH is just using him. It's like a tragedy in the way HHH is setting up Eugene for his downfall. Interesting stuff. Might actually work in attracting interest in the wrestling product.   After this I don't recall what we got since I dosed off several times. I don't recall seeing Trish or Tomko or even Victoria, which is odd considering that we had a guy in drag save Victoria from Tomko and Trish last week and then... nothing. This is what I hate about not planning stuff correctly. They can't follow through and it seems like stuff happens for no apparent reason. We've had several of those many times. It hurts the WWE's credibility.  We get a match with La Resistance VS two people who I was starting to think where currently not working for the WWE. One is Rhyno, whose had shit since moving to RAW and, of all people, Sgt. Slaughter, looking better in this match that in other matches he's had to participate in. Of course I know Slaughter is working in the WWE as a...erm... something. But it was good seeing him out there doing what he does best and, actually, looking pretty good (even though it's not really wrestling, but putting on a show). La Resistance wins with their little seen, but cool finishing move, which makes you wonder what the hell is going to happen to Rhyno.  The previous match also makes you wonder if The Hurricane and Rosey had the night off since they always end up fighting these guys. Maybe the WWE finally realized that they can't keep giving fans the same shit over and over again and expect them to stick around for more. Na, I doubt it. Still, it was good seeing something different. Of course, if the WWE had real tag teams on RAW  Okay, I think we had an interview with Kain where Matt Hardy ran in and try to beat Kain, only to be dragged away by security. *Yawn*  Oh, Eric comes out and anounces that tonight will be a stipulation match and that in order for Benoit to win against Kain, he would have to force Kain to submit. Kain, on the other hand, could win by pin fall, count out, submition or DQ, making Benoit's chance of winning very slim.  By this time, my mom turned of the chanel and went to sleep. She thought that this sucked cause she hates Kain and feels like all this crap leads to bad wrestling. She is right about this, even though Benoit's match with Kain later in the program was a solid wrestling match filled with high drama and action.  Now that I thi8nk of it, I think this was before the Regal VS HHH match, which means she also missed that too. This is why the WWE has to rethink it's stratergy cause people eventually loose interest when they see the same type of crap over and over again.  Still, like I said, Kain and Benoit put in a solid match that was worth waitting till the end of the program to see. This is what people want. The match was well structured. There was a lot of suspence since Benoit had gotten wins on Kain before, but never submitions. Giving Kain, a huge savage wrestler, an advantage in this match against Benoit raises the stakes and makes the match seem bigger and more important that it really is. Probably one of the better encounters in recent months.  Benoit gets a submition and the crowd goes wild. Then Kain knocks Benoit and is ready to break him appart when Lita gets into the ring. The loud crowd suddenly goes silent. HAHAHAHA  Lita tries to trick Kain and manages to kick him in the groin, but Kain grabs her by the neck and it ready to chock slam her when he remembers that Lita is carrying his baby. He backs off and the storyline that will not die continues.   I wonder what will happen when it's time for Lita, who isn't pregnant in real life, to give birth. Maybe they can do an Alien - The Fly birth with an ugly Kain-like baby popping up and scaring the shit out of people. I wouldn't be surprised if the WWE did something like that.  Which reminds me of the Great American Bash, Smackdown's newest pay per view event. It happend on sunday. Didn't see it, but like I've said, I never order pay per views. I just read the results and reaction and then I decide if I will buy the DVD or not when it comes out.  Based on the reaction of the PPV, this DVD I will not buy unless I go crazy or become like the real Eugene... retarded. It was a horrible card. Everyone knew it. The outcome of the matches were just as bad. In fact, the only real good match was the Chavo Guerrero VS Rey Mysterio match. They've has hundreds of these matches in the WWE. I think that they can wrestle each other in their sleep and still put out a five start match. This, I hear, was one of their best. In many ways, that's sad cause I was expecting a match between these two at Wrestlemania, not here.   Oh, and Bradshaw won. So he is now the champion of Smackdown which is further proof why RAW is the better program. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure Bradshaw deserves it, but this feud isn't strong enough for several PPVs.   Also, the Undertaker killer Paul Bearer... Riiiiiiight...  So, avoid the Great American Bash at all cost.  Back to RAW, good show. Interesting storylines... except the whole Lita - Kain stuff. At least three good to great wrestling matches. I'm gonna go out on a limb and actually give this show an B+ cause it was a step in the right direction.  Mr. Tito, who actually put out his review early today, gave the show more or less the same ratting, even thought that with his description of the matches I would have swore he was going to crusify the show with a bad ratting. Guess the guy is going soft.  It's sad the way he talks about Smackdown now, considering that a year ago, he loved the show and hated RAW. This is the WWE's fault for not being able to balance out the shows correctly and, of course, for lack on interest on the Smackdown side of things.  Before I log off, would like to mention that the WWE has a little feature on their page where Ric Flair mentions his thoughts on the posibility of Sting signing for the WWE. This is an odd thing for the WWE. Why mention Sting if he hasn't signed or has no interest in signing... Unless there really might be some chance that he will sign. With the WWE, who knows? But, I will say this, if the sign Sting, I hope he can be used better than Goldberg. It doesn't sounds like Sting has a big ego like Goldberg, but you never know. All these establish stars online want to work part time gigs. Fuck em, let them retire and spend all they've won in the past. Heck, they deserve it. But, if you want to entertain and wrestle for the fans, step up and leave the bullshit at the door.   Also, WWE, I would love, and I do mean LOVE, to see Sting on RAW kicking ass and taking names, but Smackdown needs a new here. Goldberg could have been that hero. Would have given life to the show, but the WWE decided to not renew his contact (this was mutual since Goldberg wasn't to thrilled to work for the WWE and the WWE didn't care much to employ him either). HHH movie to Smackdown would have made a lot of difference and would have helped the show a lot, giving it one hell of a heel to kick people around. But HHH backed out, leaving Smackdown without a credible heel since Angle is sick (Angle he has changed from heel to face to heel so many times, I don't think people care anymore, even though everyone recognizes that he is probably the best wrestling in the company). Brock left. Big Show is injured and is taking a well deserved rest. John Cena is good, but he has a long way to go before he is considered the top dog. Undertaker is... well, old. Booker T is no longer a credible wrestler thanks to HHH. And JBL (Bradshaw) isn't a great heel, yet. So, what's left? Hardcore Holly? Billy Gunn? The cruserweights? Torrie Wilson?  Smackdown's only hope are Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero and RVD, but even they aren't enough to save the show.   Sting would be a gift from the Heavens here. If handled correctly, he would do for the show what Benoit did for RAW, make it great and cool.   So, only time will tell.  I wish Mr. Vince McMahon the best of health. In case you haven't heard, he is very sick. I hope he gets better soon.   Well, with that, time to get back to my regular life.   This is  urlLink Sailor Ecchi , signing off.

      (From the  urlLink IMDB )  'Fahrenheit' Rises -- And How!   Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 bushwhacked the box office over the weekend, astounding analysts and even the filmmaker himself by taking in an estimated $21.6 million despite playing in only 848 theaters, many of them small-capacity art houses. By contrast, the No. 2 film ($19.6 million), White Chicks, played at 2,726 theaters, while the No. 3 film ($18.5 million), Dodgeball, played at 3,020. "We sold out in Fayetteville [NC], home of Fort Bragg," Moore told the New York Times Sunday. "We sold out in Army-base towns. We set house records in some of these places. ... Republican states are embracing the movie, and it's sold out in Republican strongholds all over the country." He predicted that the film will be cleared in twice as many theaters by next weekend, when it will have to do battle with Spider-Man 2. Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations, told today's (Monday) Washington Post that he was particularly impressed with the per-theater average of $25,115: "I'm amazed at those numbers," he said. "That type of per-theater average is usually reserved for a blockbuster." Separately, he told E! Online: "This is maybe the sleeper hit of all time." Only Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Shrek 2 have recorded bigger per-theater averages this year. In an interview with the Associated Press, Moore attributed the success of the film to his detractors. "I want to thank all the right-wing organizations out there who tried to stop the film, either from their harassment campaign that didn't work on the theater owners, or going to the FCC to get our ads removed from television, to all the things that have been said on television," Moore said. "It's only encouraged more people to go and see it." The success of the film also pushed up the overall box office to about $149 million, up 22 percent from the comparable weekend last year.

      Hello my "familia" !!!!!!!!!   I just found this article in an old email I had foward to several people a year ago (30 Jul 2003). It's an article from  urlLink CNN  and thought it would be cool to post it here. Very interesting.     urlLink Sailor Ecchi    Rape law permits changing mind during sex act:   Illinois law believed to be first of its kind in the country SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (AP) --A new rape law in Illinois attempts to clarify the issue of consent by emphasizing that people can change their mind while having sex.   Under the law, if someone says "no" at any time the other person must stop or it becomes rape. The National Crime Victim Law Institute said it believed the law is the first of its kind in the country.   Lyn Schollett, general counsel for the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said the law was important to make it clear to victims, offenders, prosecutors and juries that people have the right to halt sexual activity at any time.   "I think it will empower prosecutors in charging cases where the victim and the offender have a sexual history," she said.   But the director of the Victim Advocacy & Research Group in Boston said it would be hard to imagine courts not upholding a woman's right to withdraw consent.   "To me, it's demeaning," Wendy Murphy said. "It's like the old saying: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' I don't think it was broke."   The law was inspired by a California case involving two 17-year-olds who had sex at a party. The girl changed her mind about having sex, but the boy did not stop immediately.   He was charged with rape, and it took years for the courts to decide that he could be found guilty under California law. The California Supreme Court ruled in January that a man can be convicted if a woman first consents but later asks him to stop.   Lawmakers said they wanted to avoid the same kind of long legal battle in Illinois. Gov. Rod Blagojevich signed the law Friday but did not announce it until Monday.

      Okay, I'm going to write this quick cause today I have a full dance card. Yesterday was more of the same, which is why I didn't have this review up in time.   Monday's show was pretty good. Better than what I expected. When I heard that Eugene was going to be GM for a night, I really expected the show to be silly and stupid, even thought the WWE writers have proven that they know very well how to handle the retarded gimmick (must be because they have a long history of having experience with retardation).   Anyway, show starts off with several wrestler walking up toward the ring and wondering why they were called there. It's musical chairs time !!!  Okay, I must admit that I rolled my eyes when I realized what was going to happen. Musical chairs, in a wrestling program? Have they gone nuts? Oddly enough, the segment proved to be gold, given that the participants really knew how to make in interesting and funny. Who was there? Coach, Tomko, Tajiri, Jerry "The King" Lawler, Ric Flair, Stacy Kebler and Jericho. Man, the crowd loves Jericho. It was incredible the chants he received! Ric Flair also got some cheers especially with the stuff he was doing. I swear, this guy is not only a solid wrestler, but a solid entertainer. Also, Coach, Jerry and Stacy managed to get a few solid laughs out of the musical chairs segment. Ironically, this was probably the highlight of the night (besides Eugene's office, of course).   After that we have a world Tag Team match where the champions, La Resistance, defeat the team of Rhyno and Val Venis. I feel sorry for Rhyno. I really do. I think he deserves better. The WWE is making this guy look like a jobber and I'm sure, eventually, after they ruin his credibility, they'll just turn him heel.  We then get a segment with Batista, Orton and Flair visiting Eugene's "office" to complain and bitch. Interesting who Randy Orton is starting to complain about HHH directions for Evolution. Could we be seeing the first signs of a mutiny?  So, this segment was pretty funny, plus it set up a match that I've recently been interested in seeing: Batista VS Kain. Also, we get another match for the Vengeance PPV this Sunday. It's the unlikely pairing of Eugene and Flair VS. La Resistance. Interesting.  Good segment!  Next we have the match between Kane and Batista which, disappointingly, ends in a no contest when Matt Hardy interferes. Now, I know that they had to promote their match at Vengeance, but I really would have liked to see more of these two monsters beat the crap out of each other. My mom, for one, was terribly disappointed cause this was the match she was looking forward to all night since learning that the it was gonna take place tonight. She hates Batista and Kain because she thinks they are clumsy and bullies in the ring. She's always wanted these guys to get in the ring and beat the shit out of each other, but has also often said that the WWE would never permit this to happen. Well, they didn't cause just as the match is getting interesting, out pops Matt Hardy. End of match. Crap!  Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton defeats Chris Jericho is a good match with great crowd response. I think the crowd made the match, but it's hard to tell given that Jericho was on fire tonight. I think a lot of it was due to certain honors he had received before the show (something about a key to the city; Not sure, I think I dozed off here). He genuinely was happy to be there and it the crowed new it. It's been a long while since I last heard such an ovation. Impressive. Jericho must be very happy. He should be, he deserves it.  Next we have an interesting women's match to determine who will go against Trish for the Women's Title. Okay, first off, we have Victoria, Molly and Nidia... cool, but what in the blue hell happened to Jazz and, more importantly, Gail Kim? What is this joke? Gail Kim is HOT !!! She was looking pretty good in the ring. Then in the last PPV, instead of having a Victoria VS Gail Kim match, we have a four way match to determine the Women's Champion. Trish wins and out goes Gail Kim. What the fuck? This is such bullshit. Gail Kim must have refused to fuck the wrong guy back stage to be receiving this shit. This must be it, cause I haven't heard any recent controversies or injury reports related to her. So what gives? Also, Victoria is not at fault for the failure of her face turn. She had no material except crappy new music and some awkward dancing (which was reported as being her idea).   Anyway, it's a "Contract on a Pole Match"... Which makes me think where the writers of the WWE could stick that pole after the match. Pretty good match, none the less. Surprisingly Nidia wins. I was actually pretty happy for her. I thought that it would be good to finally have Nidia wrestling in a PPV, especially one that has so few matches announced. But, alas, I forgot we are dealing with the WWE and down comes Trish and Tomko no announce that the Women's Match would be for tonight. So, Trish proceeds to hit Nidia with a cast she has on her wrist (oh, yeah, Trish is injured legit) and then asks for a ring to start the match and pins Nidia for the women. Yep, the injured Trish is still Women's champion and, if that isn't all, there no longer is an announced Women's Match for Sunday's PPV. I'm sure they are gonna have some sort of women's match, probably will announce it before the start of the PPV, thereby showing who much respect the WWE has for the Women's Title Championship.   I'm pretty sure the WWE will just pull another four-way battle royal for the women's title on the PPV or on next Monday's RAW program. Either way, if Gail Kim isn't involved in that angle, you can kiss that sweet Korean ass goodbye.   The main event tonight is Eugene, Ric Flair and Triple H VS. Chris Benoit and Edge in a Handicap Match. Good match, with some drama mixed in. The ending was pretty cool with Eugene hitting Benoit with a chair to protect HHH. The crowd was really against Eugene here. I don't know what exacly is the HHH planning here, but it can really turn into a disaster. The crowd was really ripping into Eugene, especially when he hit Benoit. Turning Eugene heel so early could be a bad, even thought this could be because the WWE feels that people are starting to lose interest in the character and decided to add another element to him before it was to late. The storyline is interesting with him being an honorary member of Evolution and HHH using him to get back the World Heavy Weight title (how Eugene will help HHH get this is still a mystery to me).   It looks like HHH might see Eugene as a good addition to the team of Evolution, given the fact that he saved HHH from Benoit. This could be interesting given that it could lead to an Evolution break up. Still,we shall have to see how this develops.   Again, the crowd is starting to turn on Eugene, so we'll have to see if this new experiment works.  Well, that's it for the program, good show. I'd give it a B+ because the matches where good. I have a feeling that this rating is very generous given that the build up for the PPV was ok, but not great. Sure, the build up for the current matches was very good, but there aren't that many matches announced. The PPV should have at least seven matches and it only has five officially announced, which means it will have to throw together at least two more at the very last minute. This is not the makings of a good PPV. That said, the fave matches announced are pretty good. Let's see...  LA RESISTANCE vs RIC FLAIR & EUGENE for the World Tag-Team Titles:  Interesting team up. I like Ric Flair a lot and being forced to team up with Eugene for the titles could lead to a fun match and a future tag team title reign. I expect to see a lot of comedy here with Eugene and Flair winning to make an odd couple team up and, maybe, give Evolution more respect for the Eugene character. This is intriguing to say the least.  Now, don't get me wrong, we've seen this shit before. Recently, we had the unlikely pairing of Rico and Haas on Smackdown. The WWE loves this type of thing. But Ric Flair being saddled up with a retarded character could be gold. We shall have to see.  Then again, the WWE might smell shit and decide to leave the titles on La Resistance so they can feud with S.H.I.T (and Hurricane) for a few more months. *Sigh*  KANE vs MATT HARDY in a No Disqualification Match:  Matt Hardy needs some time off for knee surgery, so you can more or less predict the outcome of this match.  BATISTA vs CHRIS JERICHO  Jericho will shine, but he can do that going against a mop in a bra and panties match. No, the key here is Batista. Batista must really shine given that after the fiasco that was the HBK VS Batista match, the WWE has been holding this guy back. Little by little they have feed this guy small wrestler and had him tagging up with different members of Evolution. It's due or die here. I really hope Batista follows through and pulls out a great match with Jericho. If not, watch him shrink into oblivion.   RANDY ORTON vs EDGE  Randy gets a little better every time I see the guy. Edge is slowly getting back his... erm... edge. This could be a great match. Both are young and talented. I would except nothing less from these two.   CHRIS BENOIT vs TRIPLE H for the World HeavyWeight Title:  Why can't HHH just let it rest. It's like every single main event must be headlined by HHH in one form or another. All I know is that SummerSlam I want to see Benoit VS Edge, even thought they have already planted the seeds for Edge VS HHH, so I guess we'll have The Game win the fucking title once again. If not, we'll probably see Benoit VS HHH VS Edge for the title at the SummerSlam PPV. Still, as upsetting as this will be, we have to remember that the two HBK - HHH - Benoit matches have been gold. So, a threeway match for the gold at SummerSlam might not be such a far fetched thing for the WWE. Only time will tell.  On Sunday we'll have the Vengeance PPV. I won't buy it. Like I've said many times, I usually buy the event on DVD when it is release, but only if it's good. I will, however, comment on Monday about my impressions on the winners and my overall feeling of how the PPV came out. I will also mention if I have plans on buying the DVD or not.  WWE Bad Blood 2004 DVD will be released soon and I fully expect to buy that one and, if that wasn't enough, later this month we'll be seeing a Benoit DVD. And, boy, that one will most definitely look good beside my Mick Foley, Rey Mysterio and Ric Flair DVDs. When I get those, I will be sure to tell you what I think of each.  Well, that's it for know. See ya next Monday !!!    urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      According to the film's distributor, Spider-Man 2 opened more strongly than its hit predecessor, nabbing $180.1 million in its first six days of release during the U.S. Independence Day holiday weekend. The film set a new record for a six-day opening, beating the original record of $146.9 million set by "The Matrix Reloaded" last year.   I saw this film yesterday and loved it. It's much better than the first, which is saying a lot cause I thought that the first movie was excellent. Heck, the first film is one of the best comic to film adaptation. The sequel improves on the formula. Both these films are special in the way the focus on the characters first and then the action. The acting in top notch and it's great to see that they are given intense, dramatic material to build and work on. Historically, summer movies have been all brawn and muscle, using CGIs to tell their story. The script is just a place holder for the action. The Spiderman franchise is proof that you can have an excellent balance between FX action and a human story. And, in essence, Sam Raimi's Spiderman is a love story at heart. What's more human than that?  Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11," slipped to No. 2 with a four-day haul of $21 million, taking its total to $60.1 million (suck on that, Disney !!!).   I would like to note that I am eagerly awaiting Moore's film, that will finally have it's debut here on Thursday. There is great expectations here for the movie, given that there has always been a big Anti - Military movement in the Island. Me? I just hate George Bush, so I know I'm gonna have a good time.    urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      From the  urlLink IMDB ...  'Indiana Jones 4' Stalled Over Script Concerns  The eagerly awaiting new Indiana Jones movie won't be released for another two years, because producer George Lucas isn't happy with the script. Indiana Jones 4 has been in the works for a number of years but looked likely to hit screens next year after Lucas recruited star Harrison Ford and original director Steven Spielberg for the project, and hired Frank Darabont to write a screenplay. But Lucas has sent the Shawshank Redemption writer back to the drawing board. A studio source reveals, "Indiana Jones 4 was meant to start shooting this summer but won't now be coming out until 2006. Even though Harrison and director Steven Spielberg were happy with the screenplay, Lucas still doesn't like the final act and wants a faster pace and more action."   ********************************  Sailor Ecchi says...  Okay, so when the fuck do they plan to make Indiana Jones 4? When Harrison Ford is 80 or 90? What type of action will Harrison Ford do that will be incredible and fast pace in the final act if he is too old to even crack a whip? I have a feeling that we will be seeing the election of a new Indiana Jones. Else, it's CGI all the way. Then again... maybe that's Lucas plan from the beginning. Jar Jar Jones, baby, Jar Jar Jones.

      Welcome to a very late edition of Sailor Ecchi's RAW review (yeah, I guess I could call it that since I'm tiered now and have no creativity). Haven't been able to write this column till now cause I have been working on an article for a friend of mine that works as an editor for a local magazine. She asks me if I could write something up for her related to the topic of J-Horror. I've just finished and it reads very well. I'm actually excited about it, even thought I am not sure if it will be published in the magazine or in the magazine's website. Either way, it's still very cool. The article is in Spanish. I am planning on writhing an English version and publishing it in my blog in the following weeks. I will also keep you posted on the progress of that.   Okay, we had a PPV on Sunday. From what I hear, the Vengeance PPV was pretty cool. In fact, many people are raving about it. Let's take a quick look at it before we move onto RAW.  We start off the show with an unannounced match made on RAW's Heat. Rhyno and Tajiri defeated Coach and Garrison Cade... Okay, look, I know they were working Rhyno up to create a storyline for this PPV, but his program was with La Resistance. That all went to hell when it was announced that the team of Eugene and Ric Flair would be taking on La Resistance at Vengeance. So, the Rhyno looking for a partner to beat La Resistance went to shit. Which, btw, I never really understood why Rhyno would want Vengeance against La Resistance anyway. Still, it's very unfair of the WWE to build a feud and then replace it with another feud, and then return to it (sort of) at last minute. Heck, the Eugene and Ric Flair feud against La Resistance is really throwaway since the real purpose is to advance the Evolution - Eugene storyline. Also, to give the PPV a comedy act.  It's good to see Rhyno on a PPV. So is seeing Tajiri, who I thought was killed by Batista. Tajiri has history with the Coach and Cade. Heck, the WWE never finished their feud. I'm pretty sure they won't finnish it know, taking into account that they will probably move on to feud again with La Resistance, probably for SummerSlam. Could be interesting.  Anyway, Rhyno and Tajiri's appearance as a team and win here more or less seals the deal on the fact that La Resistance is winning to night.   This, I hear, was a good start the PPV. Short match, but good. Tajiri was the real highlight here. Then again, that shouldn't surprise you.   Next we have Batista defeating Chris Jericho via pin fall. What?!?!?! Nice way to build up Jericho, especially considering that it looks like he won't be moving on to a further feud with Batista. Yep, according to Monday's RAW, this feud is over and Batista won. Jericho lost to Batista. In fact, from what I hear, it was pretty clean. Yes, his foot was on the ropes and the referee didn't see it, but I also heard that Batista dominated the match. Sure, the WWE wants to build up Batista and, good for them, the dude is looking pretty good. But the WWE has to learn not to put over talent at the expense of good, hard working talent. I imagine Jericho wasn't to happy with this and, when Jericho isn't happy, he usually puts on a lack luster match. Proof of this? His match against Kain on Monday...  La Résistance defeated Eugene and Ric Flair via disqualification. I hear this match was funny and entertaining.  Nick Dinsmore has done wonders with this gimmick. He really plays the part well. Plus, he's actually been giving some good material. During the match, Eugene apes Ric Flair's move set (to Ric's displeasure), hits a Stone Cold Stunner, a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow into a Ric Flair Strut... And the crowd goes wild !!! And why shouldn't they? Sounds pretty funny. Must have been cool live. Also, Ric's the man.  Anyway, referee disqualifies Eugene's team because Eugene got involved in a way he shouldn't have. And, La Resistance moves on the feud with the newly made team of Rhyno and Tajiri. Weeeeeeee !!!!!  Matt Hardy defeated Kane via pin fall. Matt Hardy wins? In a PPV? Against Kain? Holy shit !!! Everyone thought this was going to be the death of Hardy, especially since he had to leave for knee surgery. So, people where expecting not only that Kain win, but that the WWE would arrange the match in such a way to leave Matt looking like a bloody pulp so he would have an excuse to leave for the surgery. No such thing.   I hear the match was good, but people in the audience who knew about Matt injuries where confused and stunned. Still, this is good for Matt Hardy. This gives him a chance to leave a winner and return with a nice push waiting for him. I hope so. Matt deserves better.   I'm happy for this win, even thought he had assistance from Lita. After the match, Matt asks Lita to stay away from him. On Monday night RAW, Matt was absent, so I guess the story here is that Matt, feeling betrayed by Lita and having just gotten revenge on Kain (yes, pinning him is good Vengeance against the guy who fucked and impregnated your girlfriend), decides to travel the world and become a monk and never return to wrestling again, or something like that. The point is, Matt's not here anymore and that will give him time to fix his knees.  Edge defeated Randy Orton to win the Intercontinental Championship in what I hear was match of the night. Randy Orton is really doing his best to prove that he has what it takes to be in the top card in the WWE. I think he does too. This match with Edge proves it. Looks like the old Edge is back. Weeeeeeee !!!!!!  Edge wins, assuring a SummerSlam rematch for the title. If there is any indication, I hope they continue to improve themselves.  Next we have what I hear was a good women's match. A good women's match on PPV? No way !!! Victoria defeated Molly Holly via pin fall. This was another thrown together match. Still, it was a good thrown together match. Even Mr. Tito liked it, so it must be good! Good to see Victoria kicking ass and taking names.   Gee, shaving Molly's head really didn't amount to much, did it? Anyway, sounds like it was a better match that their PPV match.   Finally, Chris Benoit defeated Triple H to retain the Heavyweight Championship. Sounds like a wonderful match. People were a little sore that Eugene got involved and accidentally cost HHH the match. On the other hand, others comment that it help add more drama. Still, sounds like a good match.  All in all, this PPV sounded really solid, like last month's Bad Blood. This is very good for the WWE. This is the streak of quality PPV they need. I am most definitely buying this when it gets to DVD. Now, about the Smackdown PPV... sorry guys, it ain't happening. Maybe after Angle returns to wrestle... I will think about it.  This leads me to talk a little about SummerSlam. I'm pretty sure that Angle and Eddie Guerrero will have a match together, making this a hot WWXX rematch (which I believe will be a whole lot better). JBL (A.K.A. Brashaw) will probably take on Undertaker... *sigh*  On the RAW side, I'm looking forward to a Chris Benoit and HHH rematch, even thought I have a feeling that the match that will take place will be a three way match between HHH, Eugene and Benoit. Anyway, Edge VS Orton is pretty much locked in.   I would also love to see Ric Flair VS William Regal. Yeah, I know. I'm weird. I really think these old guys will click in the ring. We might be also seeing a Kain VS Jericho match and a Trish VS Victoria match. Oh, and La Resistance VS. Rhyno and Tajiri. Not bad actually. Sounds like the RAW side has more structure and interesting matches possibility than the Smackdown side. All I know is that no matter what happens on the Smackdown side, they better have RVD and Rey Mysterio on the card.   Anyway, on to RAW...   The show starts up with a slight teaser that there will be a confrontation between Eugene and Evolution. HHH says he will get Eugene and that the rest of Evolution should follow his lead, but when a frighten Eugene appears to apologies to HHH, The Game responds in a sweet manner. HHH says it's okay and that he doesn't bare a grudge and that Eugene made an honest mistake. This obviously shocks the rest of Evolution who wonder if their leader has gone bonkers. Of course, HHH has something planed for the boy, soooooooooooooooooo... on with the show.  Show starts with one hell of a match between Edge, the newly crowd Intercontinental Champion, and Batista. Edge wins what can only be described as a battle. Both looked really good. Batista has been impressing me for a while now. Tonight was proof that this guy is ready for the big leagues. Randy Orton, look out !!! You could find yourself being demoted soon.   Speaking of Randy, Orton gets involved only to be thrown out by the Referee, a move that got a very positive reaction from the crowd. The match moves on, back and forth with some near pins. Finally, Edge wins, but he has to cheat to win. Interesting. Edge had to grab on to Batista's tights to win. Good stuff. Actually made Batista look like a monster. This is a good think. I really liked this match. Excellent way to start the show.    Next, Rhyno (with Tajiri) def. Robert Conway (with Sylvain Grenier). Not a bad match. Just too short. The crowd seems to like the pairing of Rhyno and Tajiri. I'm liking this very much.  I think around this time, maybe before this match, Eugene comes to see Uncle Eric and a match is booked for the main event tonight... Eugene VS. Benoit for the gold !!! Damn, this could be a good thing or a bad thing. It has Evolution intervention written all over it.   Many people wonder if it's a good idea to overexpose the Eugene character like the WWE is doing. I'm not sure if it's bringing any new fans. Since its a comedy item in the show, it's probably bringing in a lot of children and families to the show. How ironic, no? Still, that good fortune is about to end tonight. More on that later...  Tyson Tomko (with Trish Stratus) def. Maven (with Nidia) in a crappy match. Two too green wrestlers fighting it out. To RAW's Heat with both of you!  Jericho has a Highlight reel segment with Lita and Kain as guests. Boy, was this smart. Kain is burned by Lita's comments. He proceeds to tear apart Jericho's set. Funny how Jericho places himself in harms way to protect his expensive television monitor. Jericho would later challenge Kain to a match. The match is pretty lame. It's like Jericho isn't in it. Kain hits Jericho in the nuts and we have a DQ. Yes, Kain is such a monster...  Only good part of the match is when he choke slams both Jericho and the referee. This woke up the audience. I think they actually cheered !!! Hahaha Nothing like having a referee get it to receive a cool pop from the audience.   We also have Ric Flair defeat The Hurricane in an ok match that was made because Hurricane reminded Ric that his book wasn't selling as hot as Rock's or Foley's books. Funny stuff. Ric is still THE MAN! On the other hand, Hurricane needs to start finding a new agent.  Finally, the main event and out plops happy Eugene, waving at the crowd who seem to enjoy him being there. Benoit comes out and it's back to busyness.  The match was interesting. Actually, pretty exiting given that both these guys know how to excite. Heck, there was a moment where I actually saw people standing up to watch the match. I am shocked at how people are reacting to Eugene's character. Eugene uses one of Benoit's moves, the cross face, and the crowd goes wild. Heck, when Eugene gives Benoit a Rock Bottom, the crowd gasps and cheers. It was a near three count, but Eugene thinks he's one and starts celebrating, when Evolution comes down to wreck the party. Yep, you guessed it...  EVOLUTION Beat down!!!!!  Yes, and everything officially goes back to shit. The spell is broken. The old HHH is back. A beatdown can only signal one thing... the end of Eugene's push and a one way ticket to the mid card. Don't believe me? Who has had the honor or receiving a full blast Evolution beat down? RVD... Booker T ... Scott Steiner... Yep, done wonders for everyone there.   The problem is a little more serious... Eugene was actually a character that people were clicking with. Heck, after this bloody beat down, that clearly left the audience numb, you will probably be seeing a drop in the ratings due to parents pulling their crying kids away from TV. Yes, Eugene is a character children relate too. Now, Eugene is a bloody mess. Goodnight, children.  And the WWE wonders why parents no longer buy the WWE toys for their children.  A good program ends in a sour note. Still, I will give it a B- because Edge VS Batista was really special. Other matches where okay and the segments where good, but the ending isn't new. In fact, it's the same ending they used to use a year ago to finish every RAW: Evolution Beat Down.  Of course, we all remember how well RAW was doing last year...  Well, hope next Monday's show is better. Well, back to work. Again, sorry for the delay in the review. See ya all next Tuesday.    urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      Okay, first things first, due to a prior engagement, I missed the first 1/2 hour of this show and the final forty minutes or so. So, I won't be giving out a grade. I will focus on what I saw and on what I heard about the show.   Okay, from what I can figure out, the first segment of the night was HHH gloating about his actions last week. Back to basics, I see. *sign*   The only good part of this was that Eric Bischoff comes out and announces a 60 minute Iron Man Match with Benoit vs. HHH next RAW. Cool !!! That is something I am sure not to miss. What? Is Smackdown pulling a PPV this Sunday? Why such a high profile match? Anyway, I won't complain. Bring it on, baby !!!   Another thing I liked was reading that William Regal ran down, stick up for Eugene, and fought his way to the ring until (*sign*) he was arrest by security. If I had a nickel for every superstar that was arrested this was in the WWE...   Same shit, different program.   Okay, here is where I came in to watch the program (yes, HHH talking for a 1/2 was the start of the program... when will the WWE learn). First match of the night was Grenier vs. Tajiri. Good match. At least it was entertaining. I am a big fan of Tajiri and it's great seeing him back.   Next up was Chris Jericho's Highlight Reel. Who were the guest? The 10  finalists from the Diva Search. Fuck !!! I don't want to see this shit. If I want half naked women, I'll turn to the internet, thank you very much!!! This is most definitely a failed experiment for the WWE. Proof of this was the reaction of the crowd. They didn't give a fuck. This is so stupid. This segment sucks. Jericho tells them to trash Eric's office to find an "immunity envelope". The girls destroy the office. What's the point? Then Jericho slips out, leaving the girls to face an enrages Eric Bischoff. Yep, Eric bitched, screamed and threatened the girls. I am sure the WWE thinks that we watch wrestling to watch men be mean to women. Here, something like that would have gotten Eric beaten up. Try screaming crap at ten Latino women. Hell, you'll be lucky if you survive with your testicles intact.   Anyway, bad and extremely, pointless segment that did shit for everyone involved. Question, wouldn't tricking women to do vandalism, then slipping out to avoid capture so you can leave the women to face the wrath constitute an act of extreme evil? Yep, Jericho is such a good guy !!! The thing is that Jericho escapes without heat because people are too busy hating the diva contestants. Erm... Is that what you wanted, WWE?   Next we have Tyson Tomko vs. Hurricane. Hurricane needs to get a new agent. At least now Stacy is with him, but is this really going to help him? I saw, send him to Smackdown and have him wrestler Chavo Guerrero or Rey Mysterio. Maybe he can even turn heel. Super hero becomes super villain. That would be great. Oh, and Tomko wins. Like there was any doubt.   Tomko and Trish beat up on the Hurricane, but in comes the new Rosie (as in new gimmick) for a rescue. Apparently, judging by his new costume, he is no longer the Super-hero-in-training (SHIT), but a full fledged super hero. Riiiiiiiiight...   Lets more on...   Batista vs. Chris Benoit.   Interesting match with Batista actually dominating Benoit. Huh? What?   Hey, it's Batista's home town. Feel the love. People are actually digging Batista. Also, he has improved. I think that if the WWE plays it's cards right, we could have another Brock Lesnar. Even thought what made Brock was having Paul Heyman as a manager. Damn, he's good.   Anyway, watch Batista continues to improve each week. Don't know how this helps Benoit, but at least next week he will be in the Ironman Match with HHH which I am eager to see.   From here on, I was no longer able to watch the program. So, from what I hear...   Next, it was Kane vs. Chris Jericho. Of course, Eric made this match to get even with what he made the Divas do to his office. Sounded like a crappy match. These two don't mix well in the ring. Bad feud. Hey, what happend to Lita and her baby???   The main event was Edge vs. Randy Orton for the IC title. These guys are clicking in the ring. I am looking forward to their SummerSlam rematch. Sounds like this match was pretty good. This is very positive. I like both these guys (obviously, Edge more than Orton, but Orton is relatively new compared to Edge).   It's funny how much the Evolution stable has helped Orton and Batista. Both these guys have improved because of it. Also, because they realized that even if a push was handed to you on a silver plate, you still had to work to keep it.   Show sounded pretty good, except for the 1/2 of HHH talking and the 1/2 devoted to the stupid Diva Search Contest.   Wait? Does that mean that we got a show that was one hour of shit and then one hour of good to mediocre wrestling? Sorry, I detract what I said about the show being good. Damn!   I wasn't going to put a rating up, but given the fact that more than 1/2 the show was crap, I believe this would get a D- in my book.   Well, that's that. See ya next Tuesday.     urlLink Sailor Ecchi

      Hey, another late review !!! Okay, let me explain. Ít's not a matter of me being lazy. Just that I really have a lot of work to do, plus I am currently working on four (not one, not two or even three!) screenplays. Which, btw, are coming along real nice. Might even start another one in two weeks. Which means I have to finish at least one or two ASAP.   So, expect the reviews a little later than usual. Also, a little shorter. Have to get these out quick, before the work load starts to pile up. Right now, I'm actually late with a few things, so I better get this show going.   This will be a really easy show to review, since there were only two long events and some of the Diva contest stuff.   We start out with a Diva elimination. Which is always a good way to get people to change the channel. A Diva gets cut from the list and, well, people just don't care.   I will go on record in saying that the only person there that looks to be Diva material is the red head (I think her name is Christy). In fact, she looks damn sexy and happy to be there in front of the crowd. The other girls look awkward, embarrassed&nbsp;and uninspired. So, I'm sure the fans, those that give a damn about this crap, will single her as the winner. If not, the WWE is going to have another flop on it's hands cause all the other girls don't fit in.   Next we had a battle royal, over the top, elimination match. Damn, these things are fun. Repetitive, but fun. Pretty good stuff, with Flair, Orton, Batista, Edge, Jericho, Kain and Rhyno being the highlights. I swear, Batista and Kain should be given a longer match together. These guys feel like they want to feud and people know it. Anyway, the final segments between Orton and Jericho were brilliant. Sure, we net fans knew that Orton would win, but it still played out very well.   Interesting choice having Orton go against Benoit at Sumer Slam. This is an honor. I think Orton worked hard for this. Sure, he might not be ready, yet. Then again, maybe he is. This is the best way to find out. I have a feeling that Orton has a great wrestler in him and that he is ready to step up to the plate. As for the news that he might actually win... well... That's a different story.   I know that they are thinking that having Randy Orton on top would make him a quick star and breath life into the&nbsp;RAW main event (which is stupid cause Benoit is&nbsp;doing fine by himself), but this is an honor that Randy Orton hasn't yet&nbsp;to win. Yes, he is main event caliber. Yes, he has the look and the skill, but he is to young.&nbsp;Also, just look at all the sweat and punishment Benoit had to go through to&nbsp;receive the honor of being WWE Champion. To loose that to Orton, who just got here? It's not right. Benoit is an excellent wrestling champion.&nbsp;   Orton is good, but not that good. Has potential to being another flop if a title is put&nbsp;on him.   Also, this might just be an excuse to have HHH and Randy Orton feud so HHH can win the title back. Which would suck RAW eggs!   HHH should no longer be champion. He's had his run.&nbsp;Keep him away from the title.   That said, the 60 minute Iron Man match between HHH and Benoit was excellent. These two guys still have it. No one can deny this, HHH is one hard worker. Heck, probably one of the&nbsp;hardest working wrestler in the roster. Both these guys are&nbsp;still in their prime (even thought I have a feeling that they have so much pride, that they will always try to give 100% even thought their bodies are screaming "rest home").   The rest of the Evolution members, except Orton (...Interesting...), step in and beat down Benoit nearing the end of the match. Eugene steps in and cleans house, plus helps Benoit win, thereby securing a HHH vs. Eugene match at Summer Slam. This is a good thing cause it keeps HHH in the PPV scene, but without the championship, plus helps put over talent. This is a great idea, especially taking into consideration that Eugene is that bad gimmick that actually, miraculously, worked. The WWE knows this is a fluke, but they have to milk it for all it's worst. We will have to see how this pans out.   That said, this show was pretty good. Even the Diva stuff was entertaining (if only to show that almost all of these girls don't have what it takes to be WWE Divas). Only two wrestling events, but they were fun, entertaining and exciting. I will give this show an A-. Yep, a high grade. I liked this show very much. Two solid gimmick matches that kept people interested.   I would like to comment more, but right now I am very close to loosing my job, so&nbsp;I'll leave it here. See ya next Tuesday. I hope...    urlLink Sailor Ecchi     &nbsp;

      Welcome back to another quick wrestling recap and review. It has to be quick cause I have my dance card full today. It's been a crazy month, which is why I have neglected my blog during this time.  Okay, intro to the show is cut by HHH who pops in and screams: "I'm stopping this program". And, of course, the intro stops abruptly. This is so stupid. I would expect this silly stunt from a kiddy program, but not the WWE.  Anyway, HHH talks and nobody listens... well, except the "captive" live audience who can't do jack about it but listen or go to the concession stand (like normal people often do during the Diva contest).  Regal interrupt and gives HHH a verbal bashing which gets a cool reaction from the audience. Damn, I really like William Regal.  A match is set up for later between the two.  Next, a Diva gets cut. Boring !!!  To be fair, I'll admit that I am curious of who will win, but I would rather the selections would be shown someplace else.  Here is my short impression of the finalists for the Diva contest...  Michelle McCool - Didn't impress me  Christy Hemme - Okay, this firery read head has got my vote for sure. She really seems like she likes being there. She has the look, the moves and the style. This girl IS RAW material. The way she talks and moves. This girl looks like someone who will be willing to give 100% as a Diva and probably will do anything that the WWE asks of her. Perfect!!!  Maria Kanellis - This one is cute. Didn't impress me before, but shy looked great in a bikini.  Tracie Wright - This girl is pretty and hot in a bikini, but she has no style and doesn't know how to get the audience pumped up. Not Raw Material.  Carmella DeCesare - Okay, she is gorgeous, but this woman does not want to be here. Look for awkward and uncomfortable she looks. She just waves and smiles. This girl looks like a model and I'm sure she has the preparation and intelligence to know that this shit isn't forth it. Not even for the money she is being offered. It's obvious she is sabotaging herself by not giving 100% or showing any spunk. Would be extremely funny if she wins. What will the WWE do then? Would be the ultimate fan rebellion for having to put up with this shit.  Chandra Costello - What a bimbo!!! Oh my God !!! Please someone guy this girl a clue. Damn, I even feel sorry for her. It's not enough that all the girls are being exploited on national TV, but this girl is coming off as such a retard. Damn !!!  Amy Weber - Is cute and apparently, judging by the crown reaction, a favorite. Could be something.  Joy Giovanni - Wow, what a body. Could be something too.  Anyway, I'm at the voting both section of the WWE web. My vote goes to...  Christy Hemme  Anyway, back to the show.   Rhyno & Tajiri defeat La Resistance (non-title match)  Rhyno &amp; Tajiri... I like this team. The crowd loves this team. It's not a comedy team. This is the real deal. Real wrestlers that have chemistry together. While I am not convinced that this is the best way of using both wrestlers, I am glad that they are getting TV time, especially Rhyno who I thought would be totally castaway to RAW Heat and never be seen on Monday night.  Good, short match.   Tyson Tomko (with Trish Stratus) def. Rosey (with Stacy Keibler)  Boring !!! The only good thing about this match was Stacy Keibler. I mean, look at Tomko's offense. Pushing. How the fuck did this guy get here? Rosey's credibility is shot. I liked him as part of the tag team Three Minute Warning. After the other fat dude got canned from the WWE, this guy's career has gone down the crapper.  Bad ending. Crowd killing match. Hope this doesn't become a feud.   William Regal def. Triple H (DQ)  Well, it was short. Would have liked an actual match. God knows, Regal can take it. It's starts as a brawl in the top part of the ramp, goes to the ring, HHH uses brass knucks, pulls out the sledge hammer. End of story. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this.  And so, we get HHH VS Eugene for Summer Slam. Which means that Eugene's push is about to end. What happens when HHH beats you on a PPV. Yep, you guest it. Midcard hell !!! Eugene will be joining the ranks of Booker T, RVD and Steiner (who won't be joining us any time soon).   Kane def. Maven  I actually didn't see this. I had to take out the trash and ended up talking a long while with the security guard of my complex. It was a good conversation. Much more interesting than this shit. It's funny cause when I came back to the TV. I was upset because I thought that I had actually missed something important.   Evolution def. Chris Benoit, Edge and Chris Jericho  Okay, Jericho was on fire tonight. Also, funny how much Ric Flair got used much more than the rest of the guys. This was really Flair and Jericho's show.  Good match, except for the ending. Come on, WWE, Benoit can't be that weak !!!  Well, that's the show. The only thing I didn't mention was Jericho's Highlight Reel where we saw the start of Edge's unnecessary heel turn. Think about it, why would we need Edge as a heel? Then again, why would we need Randy Orton as a face? (Yep, the WWE is planning to turn him face so he can feud with HHH... doh!)  Also, Kane VS Hardy... Again? Winner marries Lita? Oh, fuck that! Didn't Matt need Knee surgery?  Anyway, ok show, not great. I've seen better. Much better. I will give this one a C +. At least the buildup for Summer Slam was good. Don't know if the card is as good as it should be. All I know is... Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle... enough said.   urlLink Sailor Ecchi
