      Kon called me today from Alaska while I was tanning in my grandma's pool. It was really exciting because I hadnt heard his voice in like 3 days.Lol I just took a compatibility quiz to see if Kon and I are "perfect for each other" and I got:    SmarterChild: You Two Are a Perfect Match  You and your boyfriend have similar values, interests and personalities. You get along well most of the time and find that if you have a conflict, you can resolve it. Being compatible doesn't necessarily mean being able to read each other's minds, but it does mean being on the same wavelength most of the time. It appears that you and your boyfriend see eye-to-eye on important issues, which is a good sign for your future together. Congratulations on your compatibility.    Feels Nice to know!  Yesterday I met my roommate Erin and luckily it seems like we won't have many issues living together. I was a bit nervous meeting her, but we ended up having a nice lunch at fridays. I then babysat a pretty annoying little girl and was happy to go home finally. Tomorrow I am going to St.Mary's and hopefully will do well on my Spanish Placement Exam. I will also sign up for classes and hopefully see the dorm where I'll be staying :) Im super excited!! Just praying for good weather!

      Today was such a fun day. In the morning renee and I just hung out- went to barnes and noble where I read to her mother goose and 5 little monkeys jumping on the bed. Then we went to my friends irinas and elenas house where renee was given organic cherry tomatoes right from their garden. She was complimented on her beauty- which, of course, a big sister always loves to hear. We were also generously give cucumbers longer than the length of my shin- or maybe the length of my thigh--- Pretty Damn Big. (Dont get any gross thoughts). The cucumbers are for eating purposes ONLY lol. Then we went to Toys R Us- Fun Fun. We came home exhausted! Then when mom and her went to nap, I slid away to Owings Mills Mall and did some major shopping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night was a blast. I came home a bit after one. SO nervous about getting pulled over by a cop since I still have my provisionals- what can I say, Im a goody goody. Most people would say FUCK IT. But yeah, so, I was at Irina and Elena's house last night. First we played poker- I LOVE IT!!! I guess its a very addictive game, but thank god we only play with poker chips instead of money because Im sure I would go bonkers and quickly move to Vegas. I, for some reason, kept calling it a "Ladie's Night" even though there was this one boy named Adam there. Another girl, also named Irina, came over a bit later. It was such a blast! But it kind of was a girls night since I had my hair straightened, back massaged (wink wink), and my nails done. My friend Jeremy called me randomnly from Atlantic City- he always calls me randomnly- Just to say HEY. I think we covered basically every sexual topic imaginable. I want to end this by saying that I cant wait to go to the 311 concert with Irina on July 30th- that girl rocks my world. I honestly dont think I've kissed any other girl on the lips as much as we kiss each other lol.

      This morning was exciting because Tom and I played tennis. I sucked of course and have a huge blister on my thumb (which I always get). I was so not used to playing singles- I was tired super fast. Im not even going to mention the score lol. Last night I also hung out with Tom and friends. I was poker queen last night :) I also very much admired Will's new goatee.&nbsp;Funny how college changes people.&nbsp; I really wonder what will happen to me in ten years. And especially what will happen to my sister- what school shes going to go to and what she will look like. Kids change so much every year. She was so cute today; well- she's cute every day. She asked me "why is your phone (cell) on the floor" and she wanted to take a bath with me. She is so funny and extremely bright. She asks, " why do u need to take a shower?" and I told her it was because I was dirty and she says "eww, like a skunk". It was very funny. Well I have to go :)

       I was surprised at how early I got up this morning considering that Harding left my house yesterday at around 2. Dont ask what we did, we just had fun. So I went to Park to meet up with Meaghan so we could drive to Sinai. I came early so I decided to come into my beloved school and see if some teachers were around. In my mailbox I found yet another english portfolio- when will they stop. Park, I have to say, even in the summer was very alive. Walking up the stairs, I ducked my head from the paper airplanes the boys nearby were shooting across. Strangers walking through my school didnt seem to friendly and that is precisely why they are strangers. Almost always at Park you encounter friendly faces. I chatted a bit with Mrs. Porcarelli and Mr.Howell (who anxiously wants to read my senior essay to see how badly i cursed out&nbsp;CMIC lol). It was time to go meet Meaghan in the parking lot in her sporty red celica. We got to Sinai, took the elevator and got so carried away in conversation that we almost walked into "DO NOT ENTER: CARDIAC INTESIVE CARE". Safely, we made it Jayne's room. Her bright display of flowers were overwhelming to the eye. I was happy to see her awake and doing much better than I had imagined. I noticed, however, bruises on her arms from, im sure, the numerous injections and IV's that were in her. Other tid bits worried me and im sure she felt hasseled at my never ending questions about her health. Meaghan talked to her about the Olympics and friends while I questioned her about how her spine was feeling and why her fingers were so pale.&nbsp;A part of me wanted to hug her tight and sympathize with this immobile life she has been leading for the past week. I don't doubt her full recovery, but, as always, I am paranoid about how she's gonna go to Towson and how shes gonna take care of herself. I worry too much. Her mom and sister were there by her side and she had tons of support. I think all Park Schoolers pray for her recovery and keep her in thought. We love you Jayney- Get Better!
