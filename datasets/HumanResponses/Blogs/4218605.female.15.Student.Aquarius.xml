      I haven't been getting much sleep at night recently. Last night, I had homework that I started on at 10:30. Lol. And Scout woke me at 'bout .. 5 AM. Like clockwork. The previous night, I had a nightmare and Scout woke me up .. like clockwork. BUT yester day I took a 2 hour nap. It's no reciprocation, though, as it counts to the 6 hours on the previous night.  ..I don't know how to sleep. ._.;  I recycled today for the first time. I did paper with Tristan. It's actually not so bad. Whenever Tristan recycles, I'll try to recycle. Hopefully I can do it next week and the week after, to count as an ELMO. For whenever I just don't want to do one. And then whenever we recycle, we can get mad extra credit, which is really helpful, especially for this 6 weeks. The High Holy Days (Ira .. you crazy Jew, you know what those are ;]) etc.  -Sigh.- It's hot. I'm tired. Hot & tired = going into air conditioned room and sleeping.  Yep.  Comment if you read this. Ira, Andy, Bob, Shelby, anybody.  PS HOW DO I FIX THIS GODDAMN TIME STAMP?

      Mr. Lawson (principal) needs to drown in his own anus blood. ;] Rofl.  So Bob was standing in line for lunch and he opened something up, where they keep food, and Lawson was all "I've gotten onto you a lot last year. Don't make me do it this year." He's such a fucking cunt on quite a powertrip. He yelled at me because my shirt was too short, swearing up and down he's told me more than 20 times. He told me once. Maybe his stupid wooden leg clogs his memory.  Stupid asshole. I swear.  Anyway, Liz Fuller and Rachel whatsherface are going to go down. I hate them both. Rachel more than Liz, because Rachel tried to destroy Bob and I. But Liz also tried to destroy Shelby and Ira. Which is -not- cool. Damn. Figures. Fucking homewreckers.  Anyway .. I'm still pretty excited about my schedule. I mean, Spanish is a little too .. YAY .. for it to be 8:15 AM. When 2nd period starts. All day we did "This is my name. This is what I like/this is what I'm like." In English, we had to do name activites. Getting to know each other. I was Zany Zoe. Haha. And I told Nick to be Nifty Nick and Jaymes to be Jolly Jaymes. And there's this kid, Jared, who was "Junky Jared," but I do believe that shall be later. Okay, well, in geometry (last period, as opposed to English third), we had to say our name and a fact about ourselves. When she got to me, I said "I'm Zoe, and Jaymes is one of my best buddies in the world." Rofl. I'm so cute. ^^; And so about Junky Jared .. we're in the same Wellness class. And he wanted to sit & talk with me, since y'know. We have Snodgrass together. We got switched to Herzog, by the way. >  ..Freak.  Yeah, so. I hate the principal, who's really a one-leg whore who needs to back off. And I need to clean my room if Alex and Tristan are planning on coming over frequently. And I still need to do my Geomtetry homework. Shit.   &hearts;

       Photo II | Mr. Brown. Spanish II | Mr. Cooper. English II Honors | Ms. Snodgrass. Ecology | Mr. Roberts. Wellness | Ms. Smith. Honors Geometry | Ms. Veloz.   Wellness sucks. Everything else is cool. I have friends in every class except Wellness. I hope Geometry goes alright. She's a new teacher. I'm horrible at Geometry. Good at Algebra. Photo II should be interesting. New teacher (again). Ecology kicks fucking ass, go figure.  Yeah. S'all. I'm boring.

      So we did go to Antioch and see the kittens. Most of them a girls, and the girls are longhairs. I hate longhairs. But there was a nice male shorthair that I fell in love with. We talked with his sister and niece for a while, and left. Headed to Dairy Queen and ate. I got a Brownie Batter Blizzard. It was alright. And fries. And it took about 10 minutes to get it (Alex got a blizzard and burger, too). So we ate that and started to drive back. It was so wonderful. We were on Murfreesboro Road, pushing 80, windows down, music blaring. It was such a rush. So pleasant. I wanted to scream. We were enjoying music thanks to Sugarcult, Madcap, The Trio, Blink 182, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Movielife, Autopilot Off, Glassjaw, the Starting Line, etc. It was awesome. I had a good time.  So now I'm home. And school starts tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to it. Not looking forward to meeting with my friends, comparing schedules, and not having any classes with them. Especially Bob, 'cause like I said. We lucked out with not only having the same gym period, but the same teacher. And I'm 99.999% sure that we didn't sign up for the same Wellness period. ._.; But if he has Mr. Roberts for Biology (I HOPE he does), I can help him. That'd be nice.  Anyway. S'all.       ------     I took the personality disorder test that Andy took (again) and everything came back High or Very High except Schizoid. Or was it schizotypal? I don't remember. But I always, no matter what, come back "Very High" as Borderline. I self-diagnosed myself with Borderline a LONG time ago.  ..I'll see if I can get the HTML to fix itself then post it.

      Last night I took SI further. And I wasn't scared.  ..Whatever.  Davis is over at Bob's. I knew it would happen. I had a fucking gut feeling. Y'know when you get those? One of those times it was dead-on. Pissed, yet somewhat satisfied at the same time.  Shit, I just remember I have a  urlLink Xanga . Whatever. I hate Xanga with a fiery passion.  Anywho. Back to .. whatever.  I feel like watching  Fight Club . The need to destroy things is .. pretty intense right now. But, I have nothing to destroy. Except for myself. So .. why not.  He pissed me off. He will continue, but I don't have anything to worry about starting tomorrow. Tonight, he can have his fun. I can deal. I can deal with myself, and not take it out on him. It's better. I'd rather be pissed at myself than him. Er, I dunno. I'd rather .. take pain than him take pain. I s'pose I'm used to it.  I drove around with Alex for a while. We picked up Joseph, too. And visited Tristan. Stopped by MLK (and I flipped it off, with both hands), and stopped by Rocketown to see if anybody was working, besides in the skatepark. No. They come in at 5, I remember. I need to start working there again. And Gumby and Ira can come visit me. It'd be pimp fa sho. I might go tonight, I dunno. If Alex can get the car. If he wasn't incredibly late. Stupid Alex.  I'm out.

      I played around with the HTML. It's a work in progress, as I told  urlLink Ira . I changed my font color, link color, hover-effects, and what the right sidebar says in terms of Archives and Previous Posts. And the font. And I added a midi file thanks to IRA! Thanks dude. It was fun singing to it. Awesome, awesome.  Anything you see is done by me, and my knowledge. If you want help, ask me.  â™¥

      How amazing does it feel in Nashville? PRETTY DAMN GOOD, I'LL TELL YA THAT.  Anyway, the HTML for this is seriously pissing me off. When I preview the layout, the sidebar colors are custom. I publish, and nothing's there. ;x Gah. Anyway.  This looks like a richtext mode. I do believe it's HTML compatible, though.  Rofl .. Ira. Remember back in the "old days?" Your Blogger was nospoonsdammit.blogspot.com  Man, that was old sk00l. No spoons. I don't remember how in the world we came up with that but .. it was definately an inside joke. It was when we were going out, I think. I dunno, our relationship, friend and more, was way fucked up.  Moving on.  It's Friday. Last Friday of freedom, holy shit. Just a year ago, things were fuckin'  perfect  with Bob and I. His parents liked me, and had me over for dinner all the time. Now, if I go anywhere near the house, they flame me. Fo' serious. But .. whatever. Shit happens.  Too bad she was killing me.   I'm supposed to be walking to his house today. Well, not his house because his stepdad's parents are there but. We're supposed to be walking around the White Bridge area. Maybe catch some lunch at Wendy's, I dunno. Too bad Alex is grounded from the car until Monday. I guess he deserves it. Despite that being true, I still need him as a chauffeur.  My strawberries have no flavor. That being said, I'm off to get some chips.  &hearts;   HAPPY FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Hahahahaha. Shit. I hope I don't get run over by a car in the process of walking to Bob's.

      I used to use Blogger like a bitch. Now it's  urlLink LiveJournal  that rocks the house. Click the link to access it. But limited! It's Friends Only.  I'm digging Blogger's new templates. I will definately have to play with the HTML and make it rock.  Word. I'm Zoe, and I'm out.
