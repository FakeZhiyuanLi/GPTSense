      Somehow, I feel all alone in this even though I know he loves me. Have been feeling really lousy these days. It's as if I've become invisible - I go out alone, I eat alone, I do things alone. So many people on the streets and so many happy faces but none of them see me. I feel like the lonely loser that no one wants to hang out with. Never thought I could feel this way but I've been finding it terribly difficult to smile lately.  Maybe the fact that I don't go out with friends is adding to this feeling of loneliness. But I don't really want to go out with people. Or do I? Maybe I'm just choosing not to go out with anyone just to make a statement - that I don't want to go out with anyone else but him? That's kinda silly. Who's going to notice and what difference is it going to make? He's not going to fly back just to make me feel better and I wouldn't want him to. Well, even if I don't feel like going out with anyone else I think it's very important to my mental well-being that I do.  Barely 5 days since he left and already it's killing me. It's going to take awhile and some effort on my part to stand up again and be independent. Everytime he leaves, it makes me so aware of how dependent I was on him - his love, his company, his time. Eventually I pick up my life again and fill my time with all sorts of activities - gym, choir, church, friends, work. And when he finally returns, I drop everything to spend time with him.

      My boyfriend left the country for his third year of university studies on Monday night. Will be another two years before he graduates as he is planning to do his honours. Was planning on getting a working holiday visa so I can accompany him during his honours year but oddly enough, citizens from my country do not qualify. Must think of alternative plan.   Would like to apply for working holiday visa and travel around in America or Europe but my boyfriend doesn't really like the idea of me going off on my own or with a girlfriend. Kinda dangerous I must agree. Plus I don't exactly have much savings and it'll&nbsp;probably be very difficult. Still,&nbsp;it'll be such an adventure and I would really really really like to do something fun, exciting and worth remembering before I settle down, have kids, grow old and get&nbsp;trapped in the rat race of life.&nbsp;Sigh... So many unfulfilled dreams.   Just completed three weeks of CFT training and my exam is&nbsp;only a month away. Heard that passing rate is quite low but I'm not giving myself any excuses. Have to study really really hard coz each retest will cost like $200!! And I definitely cannot afford that. My escape-from-the-rut plan involves being a personal trainer and earning lots of money.&nbsp;I guess when I'm a certified trainer, it'll be easier for me to get a freelance job anywhere&nbsp;in the world.

      Sheesh... I can't believe it's already the 23rd. The last ten days at work were like a big fat blur for me.&nbsp;Two major projects&nbsp;- Annual Report, Magazine&nbsp;-&nbsp;both&nbsp;requiring immediate attention.&nbsp;Which kinda explains why I haven't been writing my blogs. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;rush from one place to another day after day like I was on a mad hare race. Finally sent both items for printing this morning and&nbsp;now things are&nbsp;slightly more settled around my desk.   Of course, this war is barely over. It's never going to end really...&nbsp;there's going to be more work next week. But for now, I'm taking a break - i.e. packing up my desk, clearing my emails, doing some filing and data entry... Sigh, is this what working life is all about? Looking back at my past blogs, I realised that so far all I've done is complain and whine about my pathetic existence. I really ought to talk about something more lighthearted.  Anyway, haven't had time to exercise much. Better gear up for some heavy duty running practices. I'm training for&nbsp;a 10km run which will be held next month and I'm not exactly at my peak.&nbsp; Another thing I ought to mention. My dearest darling boyfriend is going back abroad for school next Monday (barely 3 days away)&nbsp;and I'm doomed for yet another semester of loneliness. So depressing. Oh well... more later...

      Work at the office is slowly but surely starting to clear and guess what!? I can finally see my desk. Hallelujah! The madness started right after I came back from one-week holiday in Perth. That was April. Sigh... such a long time ago. It seems I've exchanged 3 months of toiling for that 1 week of bliss. Was it a fair deal?  I guess even if I hadn't gone for the holiday, I would have had the same amount of work to complete. From this perspective, that week of freedom was probably the only thing that kept me sane the last few months. I was able to recharge my batteries during that getaway to prepare for the hard times ahead.  How long more can I do this? I'm happy with the type of work I have to do here most of the time. It's interesting, I don't fall asleep on my job and I'm definitely learning a lot. But truth be told, for the amount of work that's required of me, the pay really sucks. I'm over-worked and underpaid and I want out!  Need to get out of this rut. Think darling, think!

      Everything that could have possibly gone wrong for my photoshoot today did. The shooting location was supposed to be ready last Friday. But when I went there this morning to check out the place, it was in a M-E-S-S. Construction work was incomplete, scaffoldings were everywhere and the ground was uneven and muddy.  Still, there was some hope. Parts of the interior and several of the low level confidence elements were done up, albeit crassly. But nothing was impossible if the photographer was skilful enough. A few carefully selected angles and close-ups would do the trick. And the weather was indeed looking good.  To my dismay, the bright and sunny day started growing gloomy and overcast some time after lunch. The shoot was mainly outdoors and rain would worsen the already muddy ground. It would be quite dangerous for the models to attempt the rope courses in this weather. Plus, I did not think they would enjoy treading across gooey mud in yellow construction site boots and posing in the rain. I kept my fingers crossed and hoped the rain clouds would go away but a drizzle started and soon it was pouring.  The photographer, models and instructors were due to arrive in half an hour and the rain was slowing down. Praise the Lord! My joy was short lived though. Everyone turned up except for our star model. It turned out that she was supposed to return from an overseas trip last night but was mugged and had to stay an extra day to make a police report. Needless to say, the shoot was re-scheduled.

      For a while, I couldn't understand why the world was suddenly being swept along this blog craze. It seemed terribly absurd that people would want to reveal their private thoughts, fears, feelings and nitty gritty details of their lives to the world.  I must admit I'm still trying to figure out what exactly I'm doing and why I'm getting myself into this. I guess I was partly inspired by my friend Charis who recently started her own blog. As of now, I'm starting to think that blogging could be the only way of telling the world that someone like me exists.  I've always loved writing and I've always dreamed of publishing my work someday. Somehow, that dream has over the years drifted so far away from me that it now seems too far out of reach. Well, until I can figure out a way to reach my goal, I'll be sticking to blog posting.

      My second blog for today... why, this must be a changing point in my blogging history. From an average of 1 blog a week to this? Anyway, for this session, I shall be talking about my life history, focusing particularly on my friends and why I don't have many people to hang out with.  When I was in Primary School, I was in fact very introverted. I had low self-esteem, was plump (actually I was really skinny until after puberty), blur, weird, quite stupid (or just lazy) and really nerdish looking (mainly cos of my glasses which i started wearing in Primary 5). During recess, I would eat alone and then run around the basketball court. Weird? Definitely... I was often bullied by the guys who sat around me in class and felt so much like an ugly duckling. I guess because of my inferiority complex, I never made any close friends in school. My elder brother studied in the same school but had lots of friends.  I had one really good friend (my neighbour) whom I met when I was 10. We became pretty close after our chance encounter at the neighbourhood playground and would spend most of our after school hours together - playing with barbie dolls and cats, reading Sweet Valley books, going to the Library and 2nd hand bookshops. While she was the brightest and most hardworking student in her school, I was usually the one who did the worst. She had an artistic flair and could also play the organ really well. Her mother didn't like her hanging out with me. She probably thought I was rude too cos once I had stuck out my tongue at the Japanese altar in her house (when she wasn't around) and my good friend had the "good sense" to tell her about it. Anyway, we started drifting apart after primary school.  In Secondary school, I suffered from the same problems of inferiority. Surprisingly, during Secondary 1 and 2, I made a friend (whom I considered my best) who was attractive, intelligent and talented. She was good in art, dance and was also able to play music. I picked up dance then and took on part of her persona but I was again, the one who always did the worst in class. Wonder what it was that drew her to me? We went to different classes after Secondary 2 and I met another girl who really made an extra effort to get to know me.  You see, I was having a lot of difficulty moving on even though my Secondary 1 &amp; 2 buddy and I were drifting further and further apart due to the different turns our lives were taking. I constantly wrote letters to her to try to keep the friendship strong and would compare every new friend I met with her. And honestly, none of them could match up as they were neither as exciting nor fun as her. As such, I usually kept to myself in class. As I was saying, this new friend (who eventually became another very good friend of mine) made a huge effort to befriend me. Not surprisingly anymore, she was also very smart and again, I was not doing too good in class. But while my first two good friends never encouraged me to work hard, this particular one did. And it was probably my friendship with her that got me where I am today.  Anyway, these three ladies are really the bestest friends I have and each had a part in shaping the person I am today. Even though we don't spend as much time together anymore, we still share a strong bond. I believe someone once said that "we are the sum total of all our friends" or was that supposed to be "experiences". Well, anyway you get the picture.  After Secondary School, I went on to a Polytechnic where I did Mass Communications, while all three of my friends went to good Junior Colleges. I never really made any close friends after that. I remember thinking then that as we get older, it becomes harder to make good friends. Maybe I should have flushed that idea down the toilet bowl. I did have friends in Polytechnic but they were more of aquaintances and groupmates. I would join them occasionally for outings but I never really opened up enough.  Still, Polytechnic life changed me quite a bit and I should add that church life played a big role in turning my personality around as well. For one, I became more a lot more extroverted. I also lost most of my low self-esteem and gained more confidence. I was actively serving in church in the dance, choir, photography and silent ministries. I met so many people and probably influenced and encouraged many as well but I again I never opened myself to anyone. I never liked to share my feelings or go out with anyone other than what was necessary. I preferred being alone and doing things alone.  More tomorrow...

      Sheesh... Can't believe how bored I'm feeling. And it's not because I don't have work. I've got stuff to do but I'm just not in the mood to do anything. Anyway, since I don't feel like doing anything productive today, I shall indulge in telling you a bit about my fitness lifestyle.  Today is actually my first rest day after working out every single day for the last two weeks. Here's what my typical exercise schedule looks like:  Mon - Weights (Chest + Triceps) Tues - Running + Stairs Weds - Weights (Back + Biceps) Thursday - Running + Stairs + Dance Friday - Weights (Shoulders + Abs) + Dance Saturday - Dance Sunday - Running + Dance  Looks like a killer? I know... but occasionally I take one day off depending on how tired I feel. On average, I work out about 6 times a week.  I'm quite proud of what I'm actually achieving come to think of it. I only started working out in March last year. Before that, I had never liked exercising and I loved pigging out. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, in whatever amount I desired. Fortunately, I was not grossly overweight. Just marginally... Anyway, the fact was that I put on at least 5 kilos during my 2 years of studying in Perth. Ewww... All my friends commented on how bloated I was when I came back. And that... was my first motivating factor.  Another reason was of course because I wasn't working and had nothing much to do after my boyfriend went back to Perth in February last year. I had kinda lost touch with most of my friends after being away for so long (more about this next time). With nothing to do, I decided to sign up for gym membership since they offered so many dance classes. I started working out seven days a week to make sure I didn't waste a single cent of my gym membership fees.  I incorporated resistance training into my schedule which initially consisted only of dancing and running and picked up quite a few tips from the gym trainers. Anyway, I started to enjoy working out and keeping fit so much that I decided I would go for a Certified Personal Trainer course and become a PT so I can motivate others into a fitness lifestyle and earn big bucks.  I'm so into the fitness lifestyle now that I can't imagine going back to the unhealthy habits I once had. I still overeat and take unhealthy food on the occasion but I make sure I work doubly hard to burn off the calories afterwards. And now that I'm so much fitter than before, I feel confident and strong. I feel I can achieve anything and I've got enough stamina to participate in long distance races :o)  I've just decided to sign up for the Army Half Marathon ($12) and Standard Chartered Half Marathon ($32) which will be held on the 26th September and 5th December respectively.

      I'm making improvement :o)  Have been putting in extra effort to make new friends and ask friends out lately. Went to a chillout bar with a high school pal and an ex-cell member last Friday. Really nice place to hang out - great atmosphere, salsa music and relaxing ambience. The booth we took looked rather kinky with red drapes, cushions and enough space for two or three to lay down (hehe)... but we had so much fun just drinking and catching up. Afterwards, we went for supper. I didn't reach home until about 2am and I had to work the following day... Still, it was worth it.  Made a new friend through work. He's from California and will only be here until the end of September. Have decided to play host and keep him company. Went out together on Monday for a movie and had dinner at Brewerkz. Planning for some clubbing outings soon. Should organise some really tourisy things to do.  Just finished organising a big event for my company. I'm so relieved it's over and so pleased that everything went smoothly last Sunday night. Next event will be on 21st August.

      My mood has lightened considerably since I last wrote. Probably a result of my shopping sprees, church service, dance classes and a long long run on Sunday morning. Unfortunately, I'm also starting to feel a little sick. Too much activity perhaps. Been having a bout of dry coughs lately. Might go and see the doctor tomorrow and get a MC.  Did I mention I'll be participating in a 10km in the middle of this month? Well, I am. It's a cross terrain challenge and I've got another training run next Sunday to prepare me for the real event. Also filling my time getting ready for my CFT exam at the end of the month. So much to memorize...  Still miss my boyfriend but not so much that I feel like crying. I've got things to do and places to be (even if I may doing it or going alone) and when I have less time on my hands, I tend to mope around less. Ought to end this pity party and work on self-improvement. I guess that's a much more positive way of looking at things coz if my boyfriend was here, I wouldn't have time for myself or to pursue my own interests :o)
