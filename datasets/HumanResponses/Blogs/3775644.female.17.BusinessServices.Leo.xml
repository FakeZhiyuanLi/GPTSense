      i woke up on 2.35 am to watch e live telecast of e euro final match portugal vs greece, well w/o tellin u shld already noe which country i supported since is posted cristiano ronaldo as my fer post. my frens kept cursin portugal tt they wont win e match me on e other hand pray hard tt they ll win. i wan my fav players cristiano ronaldo n figo to win this match since e rest of my fav players were already out. durin e half tym break i tot to myself hope tt fazli's words wont come thru. he put his nick on msn on tt day, indicated tt he hope portugal ll lose so bad tt i ll cry... really tis happened when e greece ppl scored at a corner kick. i jus hope so badly tt e portugese ll score one too, but in e end they din... aft e final whistle ronaldo cried, rui coasta too...when i saw him cried i cant help myself but to cry wif him... i still remember how swollen n red his eyes were when he recieved e medal... i hate tis!! e stupid referee is so damn 'kayu' corrupted shitty referee, i hate him!! when e portugese were tackled n omos al fell onto e field cryin in pain he don even bother to lok at them he jus put up his bloody two hands signal them to carry on (wth!!), when e portugese jus touched e stupid greece players a little bit he blew his damn whistle!! when figo stand behind e line n tried to block he oso blow, he v free isit or is he tryin whether his whistle is workin anot!! blew at ronaldo when he tries to dribble e ball into e penalty box (wtf!!) i noe ronaldo cried bcos he missed lots of e chances but lok at how e bloody referee charged given if it's brazil they oso wont win e match. WTH i hated it!!
