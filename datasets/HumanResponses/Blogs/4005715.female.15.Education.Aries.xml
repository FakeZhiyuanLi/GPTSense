(if you live in the tri-city area and wanna check out what shows are playin down there go to this site:  urlLink www.atomiccityrecords.com  and click shows.) the bands that were playin there were unfortunately...not all that great. the first band was kinda new but oh man...they were so bad i almost broke a tear. lol...the second one wasn't as bad...but not all that great either. the third one was good...but i didn't get to stay for them. sadly, my dad was being an ass again and well....i had to go home early. but that's ok...lol...my favorite bands that play there are: manic mantra, the jet city fix, chinatown, zeke, 800 octaine, the creeps, two gallants, and post stardom depression. good stuff let me tell ya. saturday...my cousin went home. i still didn't get to see my bf. and it was a pretty lame day. but i did get to go swimming/tanning. sunday...which would be today. cept it's kinda passed midnight so it's monday now....but let's just say it's still sunday for now lol. today was the last of boat race weekend. my cousin went with my uncle. i stayed here with my bf. yes, that's right...i finally got to hang out with him! hehe ^^ em...we went to morning bingo with my mom haha...it was rather interesting. none of us won any money tho. except for my mom's friend. she won some cash. after that we came back to my house and hung out. it was fun. cuddlin up on the couch ^^..good kid that boi. lol...then he went home and i watched some t.v. lol...eh....got on the computer and that's about it.&nbsp;haha and that concludes wonderful boat race weekend. tomorrow my cousin's supposed to come and over tho and we're supposed to go shopping^^ how exciting eh. lol...well thanks for listening/reading. lol ...toodles~

      well....today marks me and my boyfriends 11 months together. haha it's pretty crazy...for me anyways. because before this...my relationships were like 1-2 weeks..if that haha....yeah. so compare that to 11 months! big difference. but i don't know how much longer it's going to last. he moved to utah in december 2003. and it's been really hard. but he comes back to visit every now and then so that helps...but it's really hard. after this summer i won't see him for like 5 months depending on if he comes back for christmas. if he doesnt' than i wont' see him for about 8 months!!! i don't know if i can do it tho...because when i had to be away from him for about 2 months...i was so lonely. and we almost did break up! =( it was really sad. but yeah....hopefully we can make it. . . happy 11 months babie ^^ . . .

      alright..so my cousin's visiting from sioux city, iowa. lol she's pretty cool. haha she's stayin at my grandma's house and it's not all that lovely there...but em...they don't have any american food since they only cook thai/lao food. heh heh...and she hasn't seen any of them besides me and my mom since she was like two years old, and she's almost&nbsp;eighteen now. it's really rather funny. but she's stayin with me tonight and she's pretty happy haha. the only thing they have over at my grandma's is dirt and chickens. (it's a farm) so it smells too. poor girl.&nbsp; i was talking to her yesterday and she's a lot crazier than i thought. she lost her virginity practically before she even started puberty! i was pretty fuckin shocked. she's already got three tattoos and she smokes weed. lol so i was pretty shocked. but she's cool...lol just as long as the family doesn't find out. haha...my family likes smart people. one of my aunts is an engineer and makes like twenty-five if not more an hour. she went to UW and is now gonna go to north carolina for four more years of college. to make even MORE money. lol and well my cousin who they dearly love has practically dropped out of school and was held back in the 7th grade! lol but they don't know that...haha. and it's for the better that they don't. lol again i still think she's cool. not the kind of cool like...'oh i want to be just like her!'...but she's a cool person. good personality. and a good heart. well that's about it. we're going to go swimming today lol and i don't know what else but i'll keep all of you posted! toodles~
