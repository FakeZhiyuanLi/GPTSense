      The Hooraaay is because Mallorie doesn't want her two tickets to the Jason Mraz concert, so that means... JOSH gets to go!!!! But then the boo is because he's in the hospital and he's really sick. Maybe the concert will brighten his week up. And we made him a get well card that everyone's gonna sign!  **** Does anyone want to go to the Jason Mraz concert? I have an extra... $35 November 13...

      That's what everything is right now. Everything sucks so bad. This is the most horrible quarter ever. It's like cursed. Why is everything falling apart? Why can't things be the way they were? I liked it that way. Let me tell you about my great weekend. So Saturday, I go to Josh's to have some Halloween fun and go to a corn maze (w/ Charlotte... and...etc...) and haunted house. So the corn maze, we get there, Josh has a really reaaally bad headache and we're pretty much leading him around ("Of all places to be sick, Josh, you had to be sick in a labyrinth of corn!!!"). Yeah my favorite part was when he threw up. Good times. So when we finally get back to Josh's, I drive home real quick to change my shoes and get money for the haunted house, but when I get back everyone's gone. So I sit on the doorstep and see that I have a missed call from Charlotte. Everyone went home; they took Josh to the hospital. Yeah he has mengingitis. You can die from that. And now we could all have it. He had to get a shot in his spine! Oh god... Josh I love you, I hope you are okay!!!  So anyway, then I went to Charlotte's (down the street)...and she's had an equally horrible month, more so actually... so we talked for ever, then I got us Chinese food at Safeway and we watched The Princess Bride. It was quite the girl's night. It was so ridiculously neccessary. It's so funny how I always say how much I hate drama but that seems to be all that's happening lately. *** Well today was better... me, my mom and my sisters went to the HALLOWEEN SUPERSTORE (ooore ooore oooorrre!!!) and I got the cutest Tinkerbell costume shit it's so adorable... not that I'll be able to go anywhere in it anymore.. (i'll find something). And we got some cool things for our house... but mostly I spent my time talking to this cute clerk who worked the dressing rooms ("How's this one?).. he had the greatest pickup line.. "So..do you go to...school...?" Cute. Then we got pumpkins. And I finished my Alice in Wonderland poster. So yeah today was better. Oh but Misty died. :( :( :( *** In other news, this week I've decided to become active in finding a job, (I must work in a record storrrre! not gonna happen, but I can try...that or a pet store) and I can have a Halloween party if I want, but if that doesn't work out then all you guys who have to go to the football game you can come sleepover at my house.

      *When I saw you.... Every single part of me said Yeah yeah yeah. My eyes wanted... my lips wanted to -ya know- lose control*  Stuck in my head... I don't know who it's by, it's on a mix I have. If you were here with me I'd sing it for you.   ***************  Sometimes I think no one knows me. Like really knows me. Like each person knows a different side of me that the others don't. I guess everyone's like that. But does any one person know all my sides? I don't think they do. Or sometimes, I'll be thinking they know me so well then they'll go say something like "oh but you don't like that" or "you wouldn't like that" .... and I'll just think... "how could they think that about me? don't they know me at all?" sounds dumb... it's hard to explain... i don't know. It's like that song The Stranger by Billy Joel. I think I posted the lyrics on here a ways back. Anyways I was just thinking about that because I just had a fight with my mom. She doesn't know me hardly at all. She knows that one side of me. Actually, it's that horrible side of me that I hate, that isn't me at all. That side of me that's like, rebellious and mean. Which is weird because I'm not at all like that. But they would never believe that because that's how they see me. It's extremely frustrating. You know what, I just wrote a paragraph all about my family and shit but I just erased it. It's very complicated and you guys wouldn't understand, because you don't know that side of me, or of my family. Makes me wonder what really is me.... not that I need one side to define me. A person is incredibly multi-faceted... Well, I'm the happiest and most content when I'm with my closest friends. Then again that's why they're my closest friends.  I was thinking about this the other day too. I'm a compulsive liar. I just all a sudden realized that. I'm very good at lying, which is how it started. Don't worry, I don't lie to you guys. But to my parents. It's gotten pretty bad. I gotta stop. But then, of course, my worst flaw is my procrastination. It's funny, that word is just giving a name to something to make it sound like it's some sort of disease that you can't help. "I'm not lazy, I'm a procrastinator! I gotta problem!" But that's the trouble with procrastinators... they know exactly what they should be doing. And they're not lazy, they just do stuff instead of doing stuff they HAVE to do. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I know I am one. And I know how to stop. Eh, I'll stop tomorrow.

      *And when I get excited... my little China Girl, she says, oh Baby, just you shut your mouth.*   Just downloaded some Bowie. Excellent. Anyways, yeah today was a good day I guess. God I know I had something I wanted to say.... I just don't remember now. Eh, I don't feel like typing. Tomorrow night I'm going with Josh and Charlotte (and other people who dont' matter as much) to a corn maze (woo!) and Haunted House. That'll be fun. But I'll talk later cause I don't feel like it now. Oh yeah my neighbor's dog Misty that I walk afterschool is dying! It's soooo soo sad. She's not eating, peeing, or drinking. It's almost like she wants to die. (she's real old by the way). It's so sad when dogs are in pain.. they're so sweet and innocent...awww poor Misty. So yeah I think there goes my dogwalking gig ($10 a week, NOT BAD for just walking a sweet little old dog) by this weekend probably.  She does NOT look good. Oh well I know you guys don't care. Anyway, I'll type somethin later maybe.

      Guess what??? Me and Josh get to go on the Link Crew field trip on Tuesday! I'm not sure why, it's not like we're the best super Link Crew leaders... but I'm not complaining. Cause it'll be super ultra fun! Lol I didn't even go to the meeting (I couldn't find it!!) so I'm not entirely sure what it is I'm going to... hehe. I wasn't even gonna fill one out (why the hell would I be picked?) but Ms Fox said I might as well.. and I got it! Awww Charlotte I wish you had filled one out!!! Oh well. I love you...! I never get Natalie/Josh time anyway. 'Cept for you know that Josh will ditch me. Oh well. It'll still be fun! I'm so glad tomorrow's Friday, this weekend I'm finally doing something with Amanda, Rachael, and Kerri (I say finally because it seems like we never do anything anymore)... we're gonna go see Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Yeah I know what you're thinking, NATALIE's seeing a HORROR movie??? See, blood and gore isn't so scary to me. It's stuff like freaky supernatural stuff that really gets me. Slasher movies are just fun, because everyone is so on edge to see what's gonna happen when she turns that corner. I should scream right at the part.. it'd be funny. (Hey it works on me....). I'm so in a better mood today. That Link Crew thing really made my day. So yeah we get to miss school all day. Most of the day. (I just said 'day' like a million times). Yeah. Hooray! And to add to that, tv is new tonight. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT IN LIFE.   Believe me, I could think of lots of things. But you know what, right at this very moment it's all okay.

      So yeah it was a halfday today.. I was kinda disappointed, we didn't get to go Seattle... instead we just took the bus to Factoria and ate at Red Robin and I ate waaay too much today I just realized. Anyway, we were at my house for like 7 hours and yeah. Did nothin'. I wanted to go to Seattle! Oh well. I feel weird right now. I'm not sure. I'm just not in a good mood but I don't know why. Josh! I was soo sad you couldn't come with us!!! I missed you! Oo oo we thought of a nickname for you! FRUIT-PIE!!!! Hoooray! See, you were in our hearts. HA HA HA John Mayer just said that he measured his penis with his trapper keeper!!! (I'm watching The 80s Strike Back). Oh hahaha that's great. I have a feeling he and Nick would get along. Sorry. I'm multi-tasking. Annnnywho...   I was so happy, everybody liked my drawing for the Alice In Wonderland poster... I think those'll be up sometime next week (if I finish by Friday). So that's good. I thought it sucked, but now I feel better about it. But yeah I'm in a horrible horrible mood now.I think I'll use Josh's method and talk about people by using aliases. So yeah, my mom asked me if me and Ricky Ricardo are just friends. I hate it when my mom says dumb stuff like that, and it pissed me off because it's TOTALLY and UTTERLY plutonic. You can't get more plutonic. There can't be any less attraction there. God that pissed me off. My parents are soo stupid about that stuff with me. Okay Mallorie has a boyfriend. And I just want to hang out with my friends and they have to question why. I mean there was period where I hung out with, oh let's call him Mr. Pig, for a period of less than a month. It was very hard to hang out with Mr. Pig without questioning and whatnot, so I would just "hang at charlotte's" for a few hours. And for what. I don't know. That's why he's Mr Pig. And what is wrong with me? Not to sound cliche, but why can't I find a guy? A good guy. I thought he was. But he was just Mr Pig after all. I always give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah I should stop doing that.   Oh look Mr. Pig, you get your own picture! Don't you feel like a big man. Maybe you should go shit on someone else's feelings for a while.

      I know you don't see me like a movie star And it can't help much that I don't have no car But you're my favorite thing, by far That's gotta count for something       Yes it's true... I don't have a car. My dad has to take it cause his car will explode, or some silly excuse like that. Silly dad. Be a man and drive the smoky explody car. :P Hopefully I'll get it back soon, but for now I'll just enjoy it, and catch up with Cara on the bus. YAAAY tomorrow is a half-day!!! I'm so happy, cause you know why? We're goin' to Seattle, which we haven't done since the last day of school.   But yeah it'll be a fun filled afternoon of getting lost on buses and getting our socks laughed at by black people (LOL). And lying on the floor of the bus station. We rock. Lol we're such dorks. I love it. I love you! I JUST FREAKING LOVE EVERYTHING! Today I felt like I walked around with a smile on my face all day. Why am I in a good mood? I don't even know. Maybe you know. I think it's time for song lyrics! Josh you still have my Train CD! I miss it! I love it! I'm gonna give ya excerpts of my favorite lyrics from it... (btw the one up top is one too)  Your Every Color  I can see the red, white and free in you You light the night up like the moon And underneath your clouds, I see the blue   You're hopeless 'cause you tell the truth The stars are jealous of your shine If you were mine There's not a thing I wouldn't do   OOO- I love your every color OOO- I love your everything You wear the day around you Like it's yours to stay around you Maybe I could stay around you too If that's alright with you   All American Girl (LOVE IT)  Tell me what it's like to be the house on the hill The number one diet pill And tell me what it's like to be the one and only All American Girl   Now I bet you won't say you get crazy Or that you don't shave your legs When you're lazy Or that you're just like everybody else in the world You just got lucky, that's all

      whoa, amber is the color of my energy...  i don't know if you guys have heard that song but it put me in a good mood. The lyrics won't do it for you, you have to know the tune. Oh well. I just thought I'd share this with you.  Brainstorm take me away from the norm I got to tell you something this phenomenon I had to put it in a song and it goes like Whoa, amber is the color of your energy whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally you ought to know what brings me here you glide through my head blind to fear and I know why whoa, amber is the color of your energy whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally Whoa, amber is the color of your energy whoa, shades of gold

      Hey ya'll... wow it's raining like a crazy person. It's Halloween next week and I finally have something to do (Par-tay at Josh's house!). Damn now I have to buy a costume. Those things are expensive. Like 50 bucks. I wanna be Tinkerbell. But yeah anyway, last weekend was PSATs (wow I totally don't know math.... what are they teaching us???) and then I had to practice that quartet thing with Mallorie's friends for 4 freaking hours!!! But then I didn't have to babysit after all and Charlotte got to spend the night. Hoo-raaay! And then I was in a bad mood because I had to finally go play the thing we've been rehearsing for... but mostly because of what I had to wear to it... see, Amy Wither's mom's Jane Austen society... it's one of those weird things where everyone's dillusional and thinks they're in oldie times (kinda like a renaissance fair aargh) so we had to wear ugly stupid dresses (mine looked like a baby's Christening gown it was HORRI-BiBLE). But it's over. Aaaah.  I can't wait til this stupid quarter is over. It's cursed I tell ya. Only horrible things happened this quarter. Except like those times my friends came to eat taquitoes and walk to the park, or watch (and make) bad movies. Or when Charlotte sleeps over. Or when me and Josh go cruisin'. Then it would turn Monday and everything would suck again.   PS. So are we going to Seattle on Wednesday or not???

      you know when you just have to get away tonight as I was driving home I passed my neighborhood and just kept going...  Kiss me  Out of the bearded barley Nightly, beside the green, green grass Swing, swing Swing the spinning step You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress  Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance Silver moon's sparkling So kiss me  Kiss me down by the broken tree house Swing em upon its hanging tire Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat We'll take the trail marked on your father's map   Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight Lead me out on the moonlit floor Lift your open hand Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance Silver moon's sparkling So kiss me  So kiss me

      Dangerous at the mike  my ghetto hat's cocked right  all the ladies say,  "yo, that kid is cuhRAZY"  the backstage betties taking more than they can get  they say,  "WHUZ UP WITH M-R-A-Z?"  (-Waiting for my Rocket to Come)    Hm.. well let's see  Who Needs Shelter Jason Mraz   Good-day sunlight I'd like to say how truly bright you are You don't know me but I know you You're my favorite star Follow you I will so lets get moving  Who needs shelter when the mornings coming? Absolutely there's no one Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me, no. not anyone.  By your clock the cock rooster crows Then off to work where everybody goes  Slow, But eventually they get there Picking up the day shift back where all left off Confined and pecking at relationships  You know it's only a worthless piece of shit  Who needs shelter when the mornings coming? Absolutely there's no one Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me, no. not anyone.  I'd sleep it all away but the sun wont let me I'd miss those lovely days of summer  Good-day sunlight I'd like to say how truly bright you are You don't know me but I know you You're my favorite.   *****  Less than ONE month til his concert. I'm getting backstage. Me and Char made a pact: it's either get backstage or literally be thrown out by bouncers. It'll be great either way.

      I slid my way to this room on legwarmers and socks on the hardwood...I do this often... one of these days I'll fall... and I'll laugh. And my ass will hurt. And I'll tell you about it. And you'll laugh.  *A new definition of a tortured artist* Too... many... projects.... I have to draw the posters for Alice in Wonderland, finish my cup in pottery, work on my portfolio, and paint these 2 four foot tall megaphones for cheer. Just out of the goodness of my heart. Stupid Mr. Grossman and his convincing ways. I better get credit for this for my damn portfolio.  Halloween is almost here... I used to love Halloween.... I still do... if only I was like 5 years younger. I so have the best neighborhood to trick or treat in. Damn. And that stupid football game ruined any and all plans of a Halloween party. I wanted to dress up... I've done NOTHING on Halloween, besides handing out candy to snotty tweens and silent kindergarteners ("Say thank you Davie....")... And I have so many cute ideas for costumes... Tinkerbell, Betty Boop, Peter Pan... i had a million i swear.... but I'm destined to spend another Halloween by the door. Maybe I'll scare people this time. Maybe I'll go to the damn football game. Yeah... then Charlotte and Nick can just come to my house... no to Seattle... we can go to one of those delightfully lame haunted houses. Yeah... maybe it will be okay.  Another drama filled day... these are my conclusions, though they probably mean nothing to you... I don't want to play the innocent card anymore. Don't act like you know how I think. I don't want to put faith in people who betray it without batting an eye. How am I supposed to care about you if you don't care about yourself? I do care about you. But give me a reason to. You don't know how many times you've let me down.

      So yeah I'm sick... I set my alarm this morning for 9:45 (I absolutely without question had to go to my Language Arts presentation) at noon but guess what I musta hit the off button instead of snooze cause when I looked up again it was 11:26. Shit. So I took literally a five second shower (that's 1 second to get nekkid and 4 to be 'clean') threw on some clothes and washed my face and I was gone... I was at school at 11:38. Amazing, yes??? For me that is. See I had to finish my notes for the presentation, which is why I wanted to get up earilier.. so I did them during lunch. So I gave my presentation with a sore throat, an empty stomach, and flat hair. Monkeybutt. It went well though. I think. There's no one to compare it to since we were the first group.   Fun with Billy Joel lyrics... yaaaay  Excerpt from "Only the Good Die Young"... such a good song... I can't find my fucking cd though...  They say there's a heaven for those who will wait Some say it's better but I say it ain't I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints Sinners are much more fun... And only the good die young   The Stranger Billy Joel  Well we all have a face That we hide away forever And we take them out and Show ourselves When everyone has gone Some are satin some are steel Some are silk and some are leather They're the faces of the stranger But we love to try them on  Well we all fall in love But we disregard the danger Though we share so many secrets There are some we never tell Why were you so surprised That you never saw the stranger Did you ever let your lover see The stranger in yourself?  Don't be afraid to try again Everone goes south Every now and then You've done it, why can't Someone else? You should know by now You've been there yourself  Once I used to believe I was such a great romancer Then I came home to a woman That I could not recognize When I pressed her for a reason She refused to even answer It was then I felt the stranger Kick me right between the eyes  Well we all fall in love But we disregard the danger Though we share so many secrets There are some we never tell Why were you so surprised That you never saw the stranger Did you ever let your lover see The stranger in yourself?  Don't be afraid to try again Everyone goes south Every now and then You've done it why can't Someone else? You should know by now You've been there yourself  You may never understand How the stranger is inspired But he isn't always evil And he isn't always wrong Though you drown in good intentions You will never quench the fire You'll give in to your desire When the stranger comes along.  And So It Goes  In every heart there is a room A sanctuary safe and strong To heal the wounds from lovers past Until a new one comes along  I spoke to you in cautious tones You answered me with no pretense And still I feel I said too much My silence is my self defense  And every time I've held a rose It seems I only felt the thorns And so it goes, and so it goes And so will you soon I suppose  But if my silence made you leave Then that would be my worst mistake So I will share this room with you And you can have this heart to break  And this is why my eyes are closed It's just as well for all I've seen And so it goes, and so it goes And you're the only one who knows  So I would choose to be with you That's if the choice were mine to make But you can make decisions too And you can have this heart to break  And so it goes, and so it goes And you're the only one who knows

      AAh. I feel like crap cRap. Crappity Crap boogity boo, boop boop be doop.... Like my song???  ********    "The man is serious, and if you don't believe me, you're a HATA!" -Boogie on the Wade Robson project  Oh shit that rocked so hard! Don't make fun of me too much, but I watch the Wade Robson project... I'm just enthralled with people who dance. AAnyways the finale is on right now, and they just did a mega awesome tribute to my main man Michael Jackson!!! Cause he's the lord of the dance, man! Aw It was soo cool. They recreated the Smooth Criminal and Thriller dance numbers (not as good as das originale, but still applaudable). I know all y'all except Charlotte think I'm nuts, but you know what, you ARE being haters and he's awesome and if you don't understand, well too bad. Millions of other people know he's awesome and his music and dance inspire people, and if you want to listen to tabloid fodder and be so close-minded, then you know, that's your deal. I love Michael Jackson!  Wow that really brought back my old passion I have for that guy. I mean, there was a period when I just got on him where I was soo obsessed, but lately I've been into lots of other stuff (well I always am) but whenever it comes back, it's back, yo. All I have to say is, it's all about the music and crazy talent. And most people still can't look past their pre-concieved notions. A few years ago that would've really bugged me, but I'm cool with it because I'm happy knowing that he had an impact on my life. K I'm scaring you guys. WOOOOAAAAH. I think I need to go listen to the Beatles. Looove those Beatles....  Hm.. to post or not to post.... op....Post!  I swear to god this will be my one and only MJ post. I swear. No really. But actually listen to what I'm saying! Suriously.

      UGH i feel like SUCH CRAP. My throat hurts soo bad and everytime I move my neck my head hurts soo much. But the worst part is that I can't miss school tomorrow, I have that big Language Arts presentation. And a Chem test. Monkeybutt. I'm trying to figure out where this came from. I guess it coulda been this weekend... I sing too loud in my car. Good times though. No regrets, dammit. **All American Giiirrrl.. Do dobedo dooo, do dobedo** Josh knows. I saw School of Rock yesterday. It's pretty damn rockin'. Predictable... but rockin'. Lol. No I liked it. I saw Hot Russian Boy (aka Danny) there too. And I just ran into him at Red Robin last weekend. Great, now I'm talking to him and he DOESN'T live up the street anymore. Dammit. He's so perfect. DAMMIT. There are no good guys in our school. Wellll, Time to start pedalling the Bellevue schools. "Hello little boy, get in... I've got candy..." no wait, even better: "I've got nudey magazines and I'm not wearing a braaa...." Hahahaha.... okay I'm kidding in case anyone's wondering... mostly. Hehe.  I got 2 hours of sleep last night. I don't know why. I just couldn't sleep. It was too hot. It was too cold. The music was too loud. It was too silent. It's too dark. It's too light. What the hell was that noise. It's 3 in the morning??? The sun's coming up. Shit. Yeah that was my night. Maybe that's why I'm sick. Could be stress too. Everything's stressing me out lately. Well, there's a lot to stress me out I should say. God.. I gotta sleep. Crap I have a fever!!! Bogus. Heinous. Most non-triumphant. Metakasmaklismic. (Those are all synonyms for SHIT.)

      Don't know who Jason Mraz is??? Why, silly person! If it's a rainy day, and you're feelin' melancholy or something, and your computer isn't horribly horribly slow (and has speakers), then click this... it's my favorite kid singing a song not on the album, but it's sooo good.   http://www.vh1.com/sitewide/videoplayer/index.jhtml?vid=19925&s1=az&s2=mraz_jason&adPth=/asm/adsetup/artists/az/&adPN=artist&isMac=true

      Why this day was so metakasmaclismic! (that's Judy Jetson lingo for HORRIBLE!) No it wasn't horrible... that was just the coolest word she ever said and I had to share it with you. It was horrible until Charlotte and Nick came over. We didn't do anything but it was fun. We watched the Jetsons movie.   We made a 20 second movie. Here's how the script reads: ~It's hard to make out.. it's in boy scribble... Nick was producer, writer, and director. He wrote the 'script' on a picture I drew of Mr. Bean. (it's not who you think; He's a lima bean with a cane and jaunty top hat.) HA HA HA. He's most excellent. Outgalactical. Orbital. (Yes the Jetsons kick ass.) Anyway... *Charlotte: Hi guys! How's it goin'? (Natalie and Nick enter). Natalie: It's great yo! I just got back from a spank party. Nick: Yeah, it was.... (NA & NI look at eachother and say simultaneously...) "RADICAL!" Nick: But we came back for you! Natalie: Yeah we totally love you dawg... yo. Charlotte: Woot, I love you guys too! I don't feel left out anymore! Let's go make food! -Fin- THERE!* (it actually says those last things). See Charlotte was pissed because she felt left out cause it was me and Nick that supposedly go to the party....the last part was added later. hahaha. I'm gonna stick this on my clipboard. Its just too great. Cause Mr Bean just looks so incredibly jaunty.   GAA I'm soooo excited about the Jason Mraz concert. Me and Charlotte decided we have to get back stage somehow. He's just too excellent. BUY the cd, it's sooo good. And he's the most amazing singer I've heard for a looong time.  I bought a cookie monster hat. It's sooo cute! I'm such a dork. Josh got a gay boy necklace. Excellent. ..I say that too much. Top 10 most influential movies of my life, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Heh... jk. But it is most egregious. ("Ted... we are about to flunk most egregiously." ~ "It's your MOM, dude." ~ "You killed Ted you medieval dickweed!" ~ "Dude, those are historical babes." ~ Or my favorite: "Heinous. Bogus. Most non-triumphant. Don't be dead, dude!" Hahaha... sorry... I'm just rambling now. It's 1:09 am.  * I would.. if I could.... I would do most anything... spontaneously... you know I would * -Jason Mraz  BE EXCELLENT TO EACHOTHER. AND PARTY ON, DUDES!

      This sucks so much monkey butt. I knew I was having way too much fun yesterday for it to last. I'm grounded now!!! I can't drive for two weeks! I didn't realize how inconvient it is not to be able to go places. What the hell did I do before my license??? See yesterday, we didn't have school right. My sister and my parents went to Bellingham for a Western campus visit (I got out of it). I promised Jeana I'd take her out to lunch because I missed her birthday last week cause I was camping with Caitlin. We went to Old Country Buffet (lol!) which Jeana loves and I'd never been to... Charlotte called me all upset about something so I went over there... but I wasn't needed because Nick was already there, go figure. Me and Josh made plans like three days ago to go to the mall, so I went to his place and we put together his bed (Josh: "It just makes everything a celebration!") then we went to the mall (oh yeah by the way, I told Jeana i was gonna hang at Charlotte's and then get a movie.... weird how that took 4 hours?) But hey she's 11! And I called to make sure she had locked the door. And I don't feel bad cause we had lots of fun. ("Okay he just crossed his legs... he's mine. Sorry Natalie.") Hehehehe.. But yeah I kept getting calls from my mom over and over ("I'm getting a movie!!!") and then when I got home they got home and grounded me because I didn't ask if I could go out. ... Though I'd be SOO much more grounded if they knew that I've been driving people around since like the first day I got my license. It's just not a big deal to me. But yeah so I can't drive til next monday. Which isn't that long, but what am I supposed to do with myself? I mean right now it's 3 in the afternoon and I'm in my pajamas.  But anyway I'm not horrrrribly bummed about it, cause it's just my car... arggh... But I still had fun last night at Charlotte's. We didn't even do anything, we just laughed hilariously at stupid stuff for a few hours and were too tired to finish Groundhog's Day. I spilled chocolate milk on her uncle's bed. Crap. "YOU BLEW TOO HARD, NATALIE!!!" Tonight Charlotte and Nick are coming over and we're gonna watch the Jetsons Movie! Yeaaaah.

      More than a million people bought Pet Rocks as Christmas gifts in 1975. Gary Dahl, of Los Gatos, California, had the idea while joking with friends about his easy-to-care-for pet, a rock. This pet ate nothing and didn't bark or chew the furniture. Pet Rocks were sold with a funny manual that included tips on how to handle an excited rock and how to teach it tricks. By 1976, Gary Dahl was a millionaire and Pet Rocks were the nation's favorite pet.   http://www.crazyfads.com  HAHAHAHA.... yeah check out this site it has all these weird fads from all the decades. SOOO lame!!! You know what we should have a party where we make pet rocks. It'd be awesome.

You and Me by Tiffany  Gimmie one reason why you look so sad A heart like yours wasn't made for that Gimmie your hand, I'll pull you through Gimmie some time, and I swear to you Every night I'll be so close Every night Hey, don't you know? You and me Were made to be in love Don't let them tear us apart You and me Were made for love Baby, you know, it's a matter of fact I can't stand by when you feel like that Baby, you know, when it comes to love I got time, and that's time enough Every night I'll be so close Every night Hey, don't you know?

      Theme Song numero 2!!! This song rocks hardcore, it's one of those roll-down-the-windows-turn-it-up-and-lovin'-life-and-bein'-a-girl type songs, it's so friggin' awesome! I thought I lost this CD, but I just found it today, me and Josh were rockin' out in my car! (PS... This CD is WAAy better than their first... you should borrow it). Wooo.. It makes me sad at the same time because it makes me think of my Hawaii vacation and my most excellent summer.... sniff...  ALL AMERICAN GIRL Train  To be that good, it must be taxin’ No such thing as satisfaction You’re makin’ things happen while I’m relaxin’ Like a Sunday afternoon My dad used to tell me I was lazy I got dance moves like Patrick Swayze  I’m the left over turkey for the world’s mayonnaisey The star next to the moon   Now I know I’m just here to amuse you And I don’t mean to abuse you But if I could just use you one time   Tell me what it’s like To be the queen of it all The Neiman Marcus of the Mall And tell me what it’s like to be the one and only All American Girl   Now I never had a supernatural feelin’ Not to mention a sexual healin’ But every now and then I get to the kneelin’ To thank him for it all But you probably got some inside connection So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them So much muscle that you never gotta flex them To catch you when you fall   And I know I’m just here to amuse you And I don’t mean to confuse you But if I could just use you one more time   Tell me what it’s like to be the house on the hill The number one diet pill And tell me what it’s like to be the one and only All American Girl   Now I bet you won’t say you get crazy Or that you don’t shave your legs When you’re lazy Or that you’re just like everybody else in the world You just got lucky, that’s all   And I know you’re not here to amuse me But you sure know how to confuse me So if I could just ask you once again   To tell me what it’s like to be a star on the rise A breakfast cereal prize And tell me what it’s like to be the one and only All American Girl The All American Girl The all amazing crazy girl

      I'm sorry if all these song lyrics posts are boring you but if you read just one, read this one... this completely covers exactly how I feel right now, and it's sung by one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. This song will make you cry if you listen to it. If you haven't heard it, I'll personally burn this CD for you. It's so amazing. After I just read the lyrics, I realized that to understand this, you really have to hear the song. Jason Mraz is totally incredible. BUY IT DAMMIT! I might actually be getting two extra tickets if anyone wants to go with me and Charlotte next month.  PS. Speaking of songs that make me cry, John Lennon released "Imagine" today. Two months from today we'll remember the day of John's death. Love to John~  ABSOLUTELY ZERO Words and Music by Jason Mraz  You.  You were a friend.  You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night You see how it was my fault.  Of course it was mine. I'm too hard at work.  Have you ever heard of anything so absurd  ever in your life. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Who am I to say this situation isn't great?  It is my job to make the most of it Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me.  Not that easy. Hey what's that you say?  You're not blaming me for anything  that's great But I don't break that easy.  Does it fade away? So that's why I'm..  I'm apologizing now  for telling you I thought that we could make it I just don't get enough to believe  that we've both changed. Who am I to say this situation isn't great?  It's my time to make the most of it How could I ever know that this would happen to me,  not that easy, no All along the fault is up for grabs why don't you have it Well it's for sale go make your offer,  I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for Pay no more than absolutely zero. Well neither one of us deserves the blame  because opportunities moved us away And it's not an easy thing to learn to play  a game that's made for two that's you and me The rules remain a mystery... See it can be easy. Who am I to say this situation isn't great?  It's our time to make the most of it How could we ever know that this would happen to me...  Not that easy, no All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it Well it's for sale go make your offer,  I will sell it for no less than what I bought it for Pay no more than absolutely zero.

         Ah, look at all the lonely people Ah, look at all the lonely people  Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been Lives in a dream Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door Who is it for?  All the lonely people Where do they all come from? All the lonely people Where do they all belong?  Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear No one comes near Look at him working Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there What does he care?  All the lonely people Where do they all come from? All the lonely people Where do they all belong?  Ah, look at all the lonely people Ah, look at all the lonely people  Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name Nobody came Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave No one was saved  All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people) Where do they all come from? All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people) Where do they all belong?

      This is one of the most beautiful songs ever written... I found out just last year when I went to the Paul McCartney concert that it's about civil rights.  Blackbird (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) Lead Vocal: Paul McCartney  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life You were only waiting for this moment to be free  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird fly Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise You were only waiting for this moment to arise

      Welcome to day 26 of the worst month of my life. Okay, okay, that was a bit dramatic... but it feels like it. I don't feel like going into details... it's just like half my friends being weird to me... and me realizing how stupid I was with some other person who I don't even care about and is one of the biggest lying pigs I've ever wasted my time on. Yeah that sounded harsher than I meant it to be. But yeah couldn't care less anymore. Shit why am I so good to people that aren't good to me? I waste so much time doing that, and it's always me who somehow ends up the one fucked in the end. ARGH but anyway things that DO matter.... I had detention today, good times. It's cause I'm such a bad girl. I'm bad news.  Heh... yeah I was late three times to Language. (....Lame yes.) But Mr. Crueger saved me and I just filed papers for him (believe me it's better than just sitting there in the attendance office with all the kids who actually did something). It's been taking too long when me and Nick go out to lunch. Oh well. I want my tacos dammit! Lol Nick (*dammit, dammit, FUCK, dammit, COCK!*).  I made a whistle today!!! HOO raaay! No you don't understand. I could not make a fucking whistle by myself. For three weeks. Four. And I made one today. SCORE! hehehe. No school Friday, I'm soo happy. I think me and Josh are gonna go to the mall and scope out da hatties. Heh... yeah shoot me if I ever say that again. :p But yeah. Hotties like Josh! No not you Josh (ooo harsh! no i love ya baybah). YOU know who I'm talkin' 'bout). Stupid bisexuals. Pick a side, dammit! But if you're gonna be that beautiful then I guess we can't really judge. Heh. Then I'm spending the night at Charlotte's.... and watching the Jetsons movie, baybah! No I guess we should watch that Saturday with Nick. ("You've seen the Jetsons movie????! Oh. My. God.") I think on Saturday me and Zack will hang... But yeah either way this weekend will be massive good times. Tomorrow I'm painting sets for Alice in Wonderland. I have to draw the main poster by next week... I'm recreating an old Alice drawing but incorporating the Hazen cast's faces in them. PURTY COOL HUH??? Yeah I think it's because Mr. Grossman's been stressing me out about my portfolio... but I'm taking some art classes at the Frye Museum next month.. including a portfolio making class. So wuteva. I've also been thinking alot about orchestra and how i hate it and how i'd like to sing waaay more. Maybe senior year i'll do choir instead of orchestra. Two people have told me I should do that. I think I want to. That would rock. This probably sounds weird to you guys because you never hear me sing but I looove singing... yeah. So that's what's on my mind this week I guess. It has been a most non-excellent week. I'm supposed to call Mike. He called last weekend.... I was gone... But I can't do anything with him. It's so pointless if you live in friggin' Eastern Washington. Cause if I did it would just be another pointless weekend wasted. Even though he's really cool...   AAAA Ergh what's wrong with me lately? I need to quit wasting my time with asshole guys. Aaah I don't mean Mike... Just... in general....I'm just pissed off about everyone... 'Cept Charlotte, Nick and Josh. (That was my little disclaimer). Why is the Jason Mraz concert so far away! I need some down time seriously. I miss summer. That was the most excellent summer ever. I went to Hawaii. And camp rocked sooo much for so many reasons. Oh god I miss it. Going to Newcastle Beach (Disneyland Park! hehe) and listening to Beach Boys. Shit I was looking forward to fall so much. This is like the first time ever it's been fall and I miss summer. Then everything had to get all complicated. Dammit this is like the most dramatic 30 days of my whole life. And I hate drama. I can't stand to have anyone be upset with me for anything. And if you knew all the crap that happened to me this month you would understand why I'm so messed up right now. This is getting real long.. So I'm gone. Bye! thanks for caring about my problems... no.. you're just bored huh? Sorry this was somewhat of a downer.. I'm normally so upbeat and cool yo... Maybe after me and Charlotte have some much needed girl bonding time. yeah I'll keep you posted when that comes back. After this weekend.... I hope. Argh. Thanks so much Nick and Charlotte (and to a lesser extent Josh) for listening to me this week. You guys rock. Love all y'all lots~

      HAHA well anyways. I just saw Elf.. it was so funny and now I'm all in a Christmas-y mood. Will Ferrell is so funny. He has the kind of humor that if you don't get, you hate it.... but if you do you love it. I love it. And Mary Steenberger from Back to the Future 3 (Clara Clayton) was in it, and so was Mr. Grant from the Mary Tyler Moore Show... i loved that show... and of course Bob Newhart. I was veteren of watching Nick at Nite when I was little, back when they showed great shows like I Love Lucy and Wonder Years... now they show the Cosby Show and Three's Company (???). Ah well. Today my mom and I went Christmas shopping at Southcenter (suicide, i know) and I got a cd for my dad, body scrub and earrings for my sister, and a really long pretty red coat for me.. (hey, I needed a coat!). It makes me happy. Yay red coat. And blue tights. Exxxcellent. I am the sexybeastiest.  Haha... just KIDDING.        I watched West Side Story last night... I love that movie. It's the most beautiful movie ever. Everyone's so sweaty though. All the dancing and fighting. Lol. Next week after my art class downtown I'm gonna go see the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (by same guys who did West Side Story) which is the most awesome twisted musical ever. It's about this insane barber who slits his client's throats and grinds their bodies into meat and sells it to the unsuspecting townspeople... BWAhahaha. So awesome. I forget what else happens, I haven't seen it since freshmen year when Mr. Buckley brought it in for us to watch (which I realize now had no educational value, he just wanted to show us, he loved musicals). I wonder how the big house is treating Buckley. Just in case you didn't know, Mr. Buckley had a 17 year old girlfriend and he allegedly molested her little sister and now he's in prison...    ...but he was the most awesome teacher ever! Really! All I have to say is, never drop the soap.

      Hello fellow obese Americans... did you have a heartwarming Thanksgiving? I hope you did. My mom is such a good cook. Too good. That was a lot of "o's". I'm going to do so much Christmas shopping tomorrow. Cause it's CHRISTMAS season now! I love Christmas.  Why does Thanksgiving put me in a mood for musicals? Last night I watched Sound Of Music, and...tonight, tonight...i'm watching West Side Story (did ya catch my little joke, did ya?) No probably not because you guys aren't as big of dorks as I am. I freaking love West Side Story. And I'm telling you right now I cry every time. OO and then on Sunday, I'm gonna go see a production of the Wizard of Oz in Seattle... which as you guys know is my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE EVER. k well Happy Thanksgiving!

      My dad was singing this this morning... stuck in my head.  Originally sung by the King  Wise men say only fools rush in  But I can't help falling in love with you   Shall I stay  Would it be a sin  If I can't help falling in love with you   Like a river flows  surely to the sea  Darling so it goes  Some things are meant to be   Take my hand  Take my whole life too  For I can't help falling in love with you   Like a river flows surely to the sea  Darling so it goes  Some things are meant to be  Take my hand, take my whole life too  For I can't help falling in love with you   For I can't help falling in love with you

      It's the hap-happiest season of all.... I love December. And it's almost here. I really get into the Christmas mood after Thanksgiving rolls around. Gotta whip out my X-mas cds this weekend. Oh yeah this weekend! Hopefully Charlotte and Erinn will spend the night, Erinn kinda needs it right now cause she broke up with Cassie. Nick probably will hang out too for a while. Like old times! yay. We can rent 80s movies and eat chocolate. Lol. We are such girls.... cept Nick... who is in fact.... a boy...  ****** Okay time for song lyrics... not that anyone reads them...  Love Song for No One John Mayer  Staying home alone on a Friday Flat on the floor looking back On old love Or lack thereof After all the crushes are faded And all my wishful thinking was wrong I'm jaded I hate it   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here   Searching all my days just to find you I'm not sure who I'm looking for I'll know it When I see you Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom Staying up all night just to write A love song for no one   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here   I could have met you in a sandbox I could have passed you on the sidewalk Could I have missed my chance And watched you walk away?   I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here You'll be so good You'll be so good for me

      ......... Wait i thought i had something interesting to say... oh yes I remember now. I wanted to announce that it was a good day, because I wore my new cool 80s black-with-pink-and-blue-sparkles sweater and i was a sexybeast. I was the sexybeastiest. (I'm stealing your word, Charlotte, just like how you steal my witty remarks! I'm the Mary, you're the Rhoda. I'M THE MARY! I'M THE MARY!) I also got this totally awesome grey 60s minidress i got, heh so old school. Think Beatles Ed Sullivan Show. Ah. Wait... that wasn't something interesting to say. Oh well. You still read it, right? Mwahaha. I'm so weird. Man my entries are dumb when I'm content... I never have anything prolific and meaningful to say unless I'm unhappy. (SEE ARCHIVES) There are some pretty fucking deep ones in there. But I can't be unhappy, cause after tomorrow it's a four day weekend, and THANKSGIVING. Meaning I can listen to Christmas music without feeling stupid. And I LOVE Christmas and this has to be the best Christmas ever. (Homer:) Cause if it isn't.... This week is dragging on forever and it's only been 2 days. Oh yeah Vinnie English asked me out on a date yesterday, where the hell did that come from? I don't even really know Vinnie. I guess I'm just so irresistable. That's why I said no. Cause while I am irresistable, I am also delusional and am always thinking that someone better will always come along...   But it's all okay, cause tomorrow I'll wear my new dress, and rock out to the Beatles, and wait for Thanksgiving, and Christmas season...which, btw, starts officially on Friday.

      I just got my forms for Camp Burton... wow it was only like four months ago. I turned them in too late last year, I guess I can do them early this year.  I wish I could go back in time to that week. I wouldn't change anything. ;)  ....I wish I could say that about this school year. |:\  I'd change... everything.

      I bare my windowed self untamed and untrained Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall Bold waves tumble to the season of my heart Where you have offended my faith and my trust Until all is lost into the beauty of the day  But there's something in the way you laugh That makes me feel like a child Aspects of life they confuse me You and your thesis amuse me  After and afternoon with you... And your rich brown eyes  Your lips and dark hair Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling After an afternoon   Face to palm... Tear to tear Mouth to tongue Heart to ground ...I am in love  -JM

      Hey ya'll Last night was really fun, there was a cast party at Colin's, and he has a really cool house. They had DDR... lol I suck so bad at that...  and yummy food (Char: "I LOVE food when it's in pockets!") and fußball which I'm pretty good at... mostly we just danced though, cause Charlotte bought the new MJ cd "Number Ones" and come on, if you can't dance to MJ then you just can't dance. So what with people playing DDR upstairs and music blasting and people dancing downstairs, the whole house was shaking.. haha so yeah, fun times all around. Not as many people went to the play on Saturday... Friday we pretty much sold out, but on Saturday we weren't even close. But that means that me and Josh could close up the booth early, so we hit Starbucks.... then Mexico....

      It's been a long coupla days. Not only with all the weird weather (snow in november...? ...snow...at Seattle?) but all the tests and the drama thing and wow. Mostly it's been the drama thing. Alice in Wonderland, very cool. 'Specially since Charlotte is like the supporting lead. YAY! But yah it really sucks to be good at drawing cause then you have to help with stuff.... lol. I didn't do as much painting this time around. I just did odd jobs (makeup, various costume stuff)..   Tonight was the first performance, me and Josh sold tickets and it was crazy (wow, what are they teaching us in math. We need to go back to 3rd grade... or just get a calculator... :D :D :D ) But mostly I sold tickets >:| ... cause Josh wanted to watch the play but I saw the preview yesterday... so i got stuck in the ticket booth for like 2 hours in the FREEZING COLD commons (my car windows froze shut, just to give you the idea).   Sitting there in that ticket booth  made me nostalgic for that one weekend for South Pacific last year, with me, Amanda, Mike and Anthony... that was SOOOOOOO fun. May I reminisce with those who participated in that glorious weekend.... Club Spatula, *Butt sex*, neon flamingo, laser pants-pointer, and heating dials. You guys ever wonder why it was so friggin hot in the auditorium that day..? BWAHAHA! oh god that was fun... I miss you Mike! But then back in reality there I was all by myself.   Then Charlotte's old friends from Oregon finally came... they came up to the ticket booth and Char's mom was like "so girls, this is Natalie" and they were like "YOU'RE NATALIE!!!" hahah Charlotte you tell them waaaayy too much about me... they probably think I'm crazy (don't let them know, that's a secret!) But they're all coming over tomorrow (and so is Josh, and Nick, and Erinn! SOO fun!) to my house cause apparently it's awesome and YAY! I finally get to meet Charlotte's old friends! Gonna be soo fun! And I haven't done anything with Erinn in forever! We'll eat taquitos and burritos (char: the TOES!!!) and watch movies and... oh who are we kidding we're just gonna hang in my little room. But my room is quite awesome I must say. YAY fun weekend times...

      Obsessions die hard. You guys know I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan. All this new stuff is really getting me down, making me question what I thought about him. I had always maintained that he was innocent before. But now read this... this makes me feel better. This case isn't so unsimilar to that of the '93 case.   Fox News: Roger Friedman from Fox News has exposed the real truth behind the latest in malicous allegations against Michael Jackson: "Forget all these stories that Mark Geragos was hired to represent Michael Jackson just yesterday. Or the day before. Were we all born yesterday? Geragos has been on the case since last March. That's right. Jackson has known for most of the year, even if he didn't want to acknowledge it, that trouble was brewing at Neverland. The child who is now the subject of this molestation allegation began to raise questions about their relationship late last winter. Jackson -- who is not completely out of touch with reality -- responded by bringing in an expert defender. Jackson's camp, I am told, is more than ready to do battle with his accuser and his family. I am told that the mother of the child involved will be held up to severe scrutiny. In fact, Jackson's side will likely argue that when he tried to break off his involvement with helping the boy and his family financially, the mother became, and I am quoting a Jackson insider, "a scorned woman." "She's very screwed up," said one source. "There's videotape of her acting weird, too. And Michael was very kind to her, even getting an apartment for her boyfriend." But the argument will be that when this woman, who is financially so dependent that she claimed to have lived in a barn, was told by Jackson's people that the party was over, she ran to a lawyer to see what she could get out of it. Remember, everyone in this country is guaranteed a defense, even if you don't agree with it. But as I wrote in this space yesterday, a lot of the evidence in the Jackson case will come down to videotape. There is lots of it, too, some of which may show the boy and his family singing the praises of Jackson, defending and explaining his odd lifestyle. If so, they will be hard-pressed to explain their own behavior now. For example: In one interview last winter, the mother of the boy told a reporter: "Michael has pet names for all of my children, and [one of them] even calls him Daddy. He is the father they never had." She said all her children were "hoping to spend a lot more time with him in the future." ______________________  Here's another one... ____________________  "Santa Barbara, California, District Attorney Tom Sneddon's cheerful smile at Wednesday's press conference announcing the latest child-molestation accusations against Michael Jackson said it all. This case is personal. With 33 years of experience as a district attorney behind him, Sneddon is certainly a professional, but he showed unusual satisfaction in issuing an arrest warrant for the pop star.  The apparent vendetta most likely stems from two events. Sneddon was the prosecutor on the child-molestation case against Jackson 10 years ago, only to find himself without a victim willing to testify when Jackson reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the alleged victim's family (that case led California to change its laws so that child-molestation victims could be compelled to testify.) Secondly, Jackson later attacked the DA in his music.  Jackson's 1995 double album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book 1, includes a song called "D.S." featuring the chorus, "Dom Sheldon is a cold man," according to official lyrics. His pronunciation of the title character, however, sounds much closer to "Tom Sneddon is a cold man." In the opening verse, Jackson sings, "They wanna get my ass/ Dead or alive/ You know he really tried to take me/ Down by surprise." Other verses includes the lyrics, "He out shock in every single way/ He'll stop at nothing to get his political way," and "You think he brother with the KKK?/ I know his mother never taught him right anyway/ He want your vote just to remain DA."  Sneddon addressed the song earlier this year in an interview with the National District Attorney's Association (NDAA). "I have not — shall we say — done him the honor of listening to it," he said.  Prior to releasing "D.S.," Jackson indirectly expressed his frustrations with Sneddon in a television announcement, noting the excruciating experience of being stripped naked and photographed during the 1993 investigation.  Before the accuser halted the investigation by declining to testify in court, Sneddon said the photographs were necessary to verify the boy's description of intimate parts of Jackson's anatomy.  The DA, a father of nine, is known for his take-no-prisoners courtroom demeanor, which earned him the nickname "Mad Dog" early in his career, according to the NDAA.  Sneddon served in the Vietnam War and worked at the Los Angeles district attorney's office, but has been with Santa Barbara County since 1969. He was elected district attorney in 1982 and has been re-elected ever since, prompting the local newspaper to call him "arguably the single most powerful person in all of Santa Barbara County."  Aside from handling Jackson in 1993, the former Notre Dame boxer is most famous for a case that almost stalled when Israel refused to extradite two hit men accused of murdering a Santa Barbara couple. Sneddon eventually traveled to Israel and assisted prosecutors in convicting the men and then turned around and had Canada extradite the man who had hired the hit men and convicted him.  On Wednesday, Sneddon maintained a grin for most of the press conference and even made some jokes, such as when asked if the timing of the charges was connected to Tuesday's release of Jackson's Number Ones hits album. "Like the sheriff and I are really into that kind of music," Sneddon said."  This report is from MTV News.  __________________   ************ Everyone feel more enlightened now? Made me feel a tad better. I know it's hard to understand someone like Michael, but I like to think that I kind of do... and I think he's innocent. Call him weird or crazy but he is not a child molestor. He friggin thinks HE's a child, for God's sake. He may have some strange illusions and he may be messed up but he is still a sweet kind person. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it. You wouldn't understand i guess... don't  urlLink judge  a  urlLink book  by it's  urlLink cover  .

      I was just thinking bout Josh (are you going to school tomorrow???) and it made me think of our song. So here it is, in all it's summertime glory.... I miss summer... last summer was so great. This is the embodiment of feeling-good-rocking-out-windows-down-stereo-blastin-great-to-be-alive songs... if you haven't heard it try to find it. You HAVE to hear this one. It'd make me sad to listen to this now... caues it's not summer...not that I could listen to it... GIVE ME BACK MY CD, FRUIT PIE! ......love ya.... :D lol  All American Girl Train  To be that good, it must be taxin' No such thing as satisfaction You're makin' things happen while I'm relaxin' Like a Sunday afternoon My dad used to tell me I was lazy I got dance moves like Patrick Swayze  I'm the left over turkey for the world's mayonnaisey The star next to the moon   Now I know I'm just here to amuse you And I don't mean to abuse you But if I could just use you one time   Tell me what it's like To be the queen of it all The Neiman Marcus of the Mall And tell me what it's like to be the one and only All American Girl   Now I never had a supernatural feelin' Not to mention a sexual healin' But every now and then I get to the kneelin' To thank him for it all But you probably got some inside connection So many numbers that you gotta rolodex them So much muscle that you never gotta flex them To catch you when you fall   And I know I'm just here to amuse you And I don't mean to confuse you But if I could just use you one more time   Tell me what it's like to be the house on the hill The number one diet pill And tell me what it's like to be the one and only All American Girl

      My JM live cd came today, it's so good! yay! there's a song about his cat on it. lol it's great. I love acoustic guitar ('specially when played by sexy guys) and it's all acoustic. He's so good live!  But anyways... my dad got his new car today. I think it's a Honda Accord. It's real nice, ruby red, with a *gasp* 6 cd changer, satellite radio, and leather seats (no, he's never gonna let me drive it). lol. I'm mad though cause his old falling apart car gets MY space now (?) and I have to park behind mom's garage, meaning that i have to be constantly moving it whenever she goes somewhere in her car. >:(  It'll take forever to sell Dad's old piece of junk. Oh well... but the more important subjects... It SNOWED last night. And this morning. I was up for like 40 minutes before my mom said "oh I'll take you to school today since your car is covered in snow" ....i was like WAAAA.. so weird. It was all slushy and snowy and cloudy.. it was so nice. I love getting all bundled up for the cold. It seemed to start sticking to the pavement (surprising cause it was so wet) but ... much to my dismay, by fourth period it was pretty much gone... :( but it's supposed to do the same thing tonight. It's very depressing...there are all these new Michael Jackson allegations... I don't know what to think anymore. I mean, I'm not as obsessed with him as I was a few years ago, but I mean I still love him to pieces but I really don't know what to think. If his parents didn't mess him up so bad... then things would have turned out much differently. I think I'll just resolve to say that no matter the outcome, that I was always respect his massive talent. Still, it makes me really sad. But then as I was driving to drama rehearsal i was listening to my new CD and it just made me feel so happy... it's so pretty and chill, it was perfect.   ...I drove past a little boy forming snowballs from the tiny snow patches in his yard.    urlLink NATALIE   urlLink IS   urlLink A   urlLink DORK   Bright Eyes Jason Mraz  Bright lights, big city Was quite extraordinary. The drive was pretty. I was in perfect company. The love of a lifetime, Since we were elementary friends; The one with the bright eyes...   Why can't I be optimistic? I tried to find the logic logically. I had a dream and I could not shake it. I was standing up there naked. There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand The live keep living; growing older more into a man... And I let her grow away from me.  Love... love is not pretending. Time... time was meant for mending Memories into all is satisfactory, Healthy smiles fill the page the day we spent in miles. And I let her drive away from me. The one with the bright eyes  Laughed her way inside this music box; Stored away in the corner of my heart. And I let her get away from me. But I'll never take that day away from me.

      Yes, another post of lyric excerpts.. I know no one will read them all but I'm posting them anyway.  "Too Much Food"  ... minor chord, very fast, kinda bitter sounding.. you don't know how much energy it took to memorize this... lol.. this has the greatest opening verse i love it...  You can say that I'm one curly fry in the box of the regular Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt People say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things  Instead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings But it's much too soon to leave this easy life Pass me the spoon. Pass the analytical knife __________________________________  "Good Day Sunlight" ... slow and blue-sy... with pleasant fuzz sound in the back... strangely sad  Good-day sunlight I'd like to say how truly bright you are You don't know me but I know you You're my favorite star Follow you I will so lets get moving Who needs shelter when the mornings coming? Absolutely there's no one Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me, no. not anyone. By your clock the cock rooster crows Then off to work where everybody goes  Slow, But eventually they get there Picking up the day shift back where all left off Confined and pecking at relationships  You know it's only a worthless piece of shit _________________  "The Remedy (I Won't Worry)" ... everyone knows this one.. so I'll just write my favorite part.. shit that boy can belt it  When I fall in love I take my time There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why ________________  "Absolutely Zero"  ....made me cry, sung with so much emotion... this is one of the ones where you really gotta hear it to get the impact of it...  You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night You see how it was my fault. Of course it was mine. I'm too hard at work. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my job to make the most of it Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy. Hey what's that you say? You're not blaming me for anything that's great But I don't break that easy. Does it fade away? So that's why I'm apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make it I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed. _________________  "Tonight, Not Again" ... starts off sad and troubled... ends hopeful and vibrant... great song... this is probably the best written one but the most understated one...obviously one of my favorites.... i love how he says flushed "flush-shed"...   The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again. And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely. ______________ Lalalalovely.

      Fruit is fruit in French... it's pronounced... FWEE! :D        Josh is finally home! YAY! He's not gonna die! YAY! Wow that really sucked. Cause I went through the same thing but to a MUCH lesser extent and that was bad for ME. Poor Josh, he's gonna have hell catching up in school. I mean, I am. But ya know, he's not dead. Which is good. We talked on the phone and he sounded so much better. Wierd to think that the cornmaze was almost a month ago. Well I'm glad you're better Fruit-Pie.        I had to babysit for 6 hours today. I was dreading it but actually it wasn't that bad.... cause I mean, those kids are old enough to watch themselves pretty much now. And they had a Billy Joel DVD, and I had never seen his videos before. Oh my god are they a cheesefest. So 80s. But he still rocks. American songwriting at it's best. Billy's proof that you don't need a pretty face be one of the most beloved artists in American history. He just wasn't made for the video era.  Yeah so that was like 2 hours long, helped pass the time. They also just got digital cable and have thousands of channels so I watched Juwanna Mann (horrible) and the beginning of Mrs Doubtfire (love it). And I got thirty bucks! Not bad for Natalie.         Last night was Charlotte's birthday sleepover (just me and Carrie cause we're the awesomest). It was pretty cool because we didn't even watch movies we just talked.... and I like that the best. You always come away from our sleepovers knowing so much more about yourself. Lol, jk. Charlotte called me an 8 dollar whore. Haha well I didn't date the Octopus. OH BURN! Hehehe.        Well, we did watch most of Monty Python and the Holy Grail but that was much later and I fell asleep. Which is weird cause I'm such a nightowl. Still not recovered from the late night concert I guess.          I keep having weird dreams. I've had vivid dreams ever since I came back from the hospital. Do you ever have dreams that are in recurring places? I always have dreams in this old scary school with hallways that go on forever in all these different rooms, and huge twisted stairways.. and come to think of it, no windows. There are lots of people but I never talk to them. I had one of those last night.... I've had scary dreams in the school but this one was just kinda random. All I really remember was that there was a boy with a Brooklyn accent...  I can usually analyze where each part of my dreams came from. The school I have no idea. I don't believe in any deep cryptic meaning in dreams... your brain can only create what it knows. Eh oh well.

      I'm bored cause my parents wouldn't let me go out tonight while they're gone (have to stay with Jeana) but it was alright, we ordered pizza and watched "Holes" which is suprisingly good actually. Meh well I guess I'm just waiting for tomorrow (Charlotte's b-day party) to go anywhere.        And I swear I won't talk about Jason Mraz anymore...as much.... Cause yeah that was a little insane. I just had to share with you the best night ever. I'm very thorough. Haha understatement. Hey I'm not asking you to read this... but do... cause i'm awesome....

HAHA omg that's great... cause that guy just looks so estatic.... and jason's like "oo i'm sexay" haha wow now i'm having them talk... too far.... but anyways, in the fan part of the photo section of  urlLink his site  there's some great ones... I'd be making this face too if I met him.      Okay and I'll leave you with this... because I based our awesome poster on this shot of Jason...the poster that he HAS now. WOO!

      I just read through alot of these posts.... BTW there are a lot more under the archive section at the top right that I don't want to be lost. So if this is news to you, then check it out. Every month it's restarted and archived. I also realized that some of these posts make me seem messed up... which is not the truth. I'm awesome. Posts that are so dramatic and sad are just me when I'm venting about really specific things that I'm upset about, but I don't neccessarily want to tell you what it is, or when I'm just in a bad mood and all these things that I've ALWAYS wanted to say just come out... And that's what's been going on lately. And if any of those involve you in any way, you would KNOW. I'd rough ya up.   >:P     Hehe. Wow I just get so introspective and melodramatic when I write... which is weird cause it's me. But maybe now you know these things I think about that I never tell you. Hmm interesting.   ****But now the Jason Mraz concert just like totally made everything go away and I think I'll ride that train for a while****   :D :D

      Hey beautiful people! I'm so still on a high right now. The Jason Mraz concert was soo incredibly awesome so so so great. He is soo soo... GAA i'm running out of adjectives... He has so much talent in every aspect and is an AMAZING singer with so much emotion to his voice, and it was equally so live. Every song is so clever and there's so much musicality to it. You feel like he's just pouring his soul out with every song. And he's so sexay. Hahaha what more could you want.                                         Now I'm gonna tell you about the concert, and i know anyone who doesn't care about Jason Mraz or even just weren't there really don't care.... but I just do this site because sometimes I feel like I will explode if I don't voice my thoughts. So read or don't read. But it's a really awesome story once I get into it... this really was the best night ever... I'm sorry it's SOOO long... But so before I say "really" another 20 times ....lol.... here goes...         Me and Charlotte were all totally prepared with lighters and cameras (we wrote "spirit of Josh" on my lighter and "spirit of Michelle" on Charlotte's, cause they couldn't be there). We made this TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME poster.....well okay that makes me sound dumb, cause I drew it... but okay, yeah so what? It WAS awesome. I'm awesome.          I drew his face ---remember that I'm awesome--- and we wrote "YO that kid is Cuh-RAZY!" (it's from a song, Curbside Prophet) and "LalalaLovely" (which I'm sure you've guessed by now is from a Mraz song... "Tonight, Not Again") and then because we're such dorks and we were so set on giving it to him that we signed the back, and wrote all this crazy stuff and even our email addresses (keep that hope alive). So yeah in short the poster was really really cool.               We got there a little bit later than I wanted to... traffic was bad and Dad dropped us off like TWELVE BLOCKS away... *OOPS*.... but we walked fast and the line wasn't too bad. We made friends with the girls in front of us and had them sign our poster.         Oh yeah I had an extra ticket (josh's ticket... sniff..) so me and char tried in vain to sell it but the only guy who needed it was realllly creepy and wouldn't pay full price. Blargh. No one ever just wants ONE ticket. But you know what I don't even care that I have to pay back my dad cause the concert was so fucking awesome.         Amanda who had to work came finally and then they let us in.... the merchandise was way cheaper than I thought it would be so I got 2 shirts, pins, a wristband... wow. There were no assigned seats so we put our stuff down real close to the stage on the far right.         When the opening band started, people immediately rushed to the front, but since we were right there we got a great spot right up against the stage. Kicked ass.           The opening band was Steadman. I hadn't heard of them before, but it turns out that they are SO awesome and I have to get their cd. SO much better than Wilco for REM, huh Charlotte? It was Steadman's last performance with Jason so at their last song (a Paul McCartney song I might add) all the crew (and a hatted and sunglassed guy who looked suspiciously like Jason playing a tiny accordian) came out with confetti and balloons and danced around... Mr."Not"-Jason smashed his accordian on the ground :D haha         We kept making friends with all these people and having them sign our poster, so the back was getting all filled up kinda like a yearbook... very cool.         Jason finally comes out and starts out with some really great songs I haven't heard, complete with Jason scatting (*a doobity do bat a dit dat dat*... haha so cool) and alot of improv and yeah I was so hyped... haha my throat, my legs, my arms, my back, my feet... are all in so much pain right now cause I was SOOO having the greatest time ever and dancing and singing for three straight hours.          But yeah the BEST PART..          So many people had signed our poster that everyone was rooting for us to give it to him.. so we're all shouting at him and... success! he says "ah what does that say? Lights!" and they shine the lights on us oh wow we were so excited that when he was asking what it said we were just like "AAAH!" ....He takes it from us and takes it to the center of the stage and shows everybody, and puts my drawing over his face and dances around with it ("Take note of this, boys, and remember that I'm cuh-razy" he says)... We were all freaking out and we're shouting for him to look at the back at all the signatures... and he does and...... oh man I took so many pictures in those few minutes lol. I really hope he keeps that. It was a most excellent drawing of him if I do say so myself. And if he even just reads our signatures and notes and all that, i would be so happy.        Then (((((!!!))))))  he props it up in front of the drums and it's there for the WHOLE OTHER HALF OF THE CONCERT right in the MIDDLE. We were soo soo soo happy. I still am. I bet those people were happy they made friends with us! I think I was shaking I was just so happy.          heh...their were only one other group of girls that had a poster (it just said "we heart jason" in bad lettering) but he didn't take theirs cause it was LAME bwahahha. Heh I'm mean... the truth hurts. hehe jk         He's an awesome performer. I didn't stop smiling the whole time. I swear to God me and Charlotte were like the most psyched people there. It was the most awesome concert ever. I wish I could rewind and go back a thousand times. God I love music.  **** FIN*****          I had such a good time. The concert was just so personal, just these guys having a great time playing great music. The problem with these idolized mega-popstars of late (britney, nsync, you know the crowd) is how their concerts, in these huge monstrous stadiums, are so impersonal... everything is planned out and sometimes music is even pre-recorded (???), like a tv special. Why bother. Just watch it on tv. Artists like Jason are real musicians who are loved through their great music by great music lovers.         You guys know that I'm real critical about music too. He's so awesome and that was like one of the best nights of my whole life. Great music, my best friends, and everything turned out like I hoped and obviously then some. I know that didn't excite you guys as much as it does me but you really had to be there I guess... I go overboard when I talk about music... I wish my life could just be music... everything music.. that's all I'd need. Sorry I just wrote so much... I just had to say it....I think i could explode... I think I would have if I didn't just type all that just now, so really this is for my benefit. ^_^  You're really cool if you read all that just now.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHARLOTTE! She said that was the best birthday ever and her birthday's not even til Sunday. Hell that was MY best birthday ever. :D  PS. Do you think it's weird that I had a better time at that than at Paul McCartney? I think it's cause I was with my family and we were so far away... I think it was like a dream to me kinda.. because I mean Paul McCartney's like a god. I just couldn't process that I was in the same room as him. That I could see him. Wow.   ***********  My only fear is that because the cameras weren't flash cameras (didn't have the cash just then for good disposables) and even though we were right at the stage they might not show up.... but it will always live in memory! I have to have at least ONE picture of him holding our poster.

      I mean, we're looking Down on Wayne's basement, only That's not Wayne's basement *** Woah, dude that was a haiku!  _______  Why did I suddenly think of that? Oh well. Oh i think Erinn was talking about it last week or something. Haha I love that movie. "Dude, that's my mom!" "I'm sorry Garth, but your mom, is a babe! *Schwing!*" "Ya, alright..." HAHAhaha. Ha.        I am such an 8-year-old boy. Lol. Now i'm gonna go play video games and eat outta my Ninja Turtles lunchbox.....   *tur-tle..

             I wish I had more interesting things to say, but for right now I'm just bored. Today was one of those extended period days, i hate those. But you know what that means: FREE TIME which means *gasp* MUSIC! So that brightened up my day. Let's see... Rusenko's mother died or something so he'll be gone all week... greaaaaaat... I've missed so much and I don't know how to do anything in that class. Rrrrrr. Then I was just feeling so magnanimous that I gave Andy a ride. Wow i'm so nice today. (?).  No i'm just a pushover. Gaa you know it's bad when you frustrate YOURSELF. Looks like Michelle Duffie will probably be the one to take my last Jason Mraz ticket,            ...which is TOMORROW... yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!          Hey maybe that's why I was so happy today. Well, besides just being sad that Nick and Charlotte are having problems (be okay! NOW!) which normally when a couple is having problems I really don't care (alot of couples are so fucking annoying i'd be GLAD if they broke up), but since they're my best friends it kinda sucks.... because of the sadness and whatnot and how I hear it from both sides and try to stay neutral (in most situations). I know it'll all smooth out. I really think so. Most of the time I just try to lighten the mood by saying something dumb and make them laugh. But Charlotte, this was a problem! I really did forget my locker combination! LoL.  It was one of those days. But it's okay, Jason Mraz will make you feel alllllright! Lalalalovely.          One thing I'll never understand is how couples suddenly melt their seperate lives into one. Like how every single thing you do has to either involve the other, or has to be cleared by the other. Aren't you both still seperate people? I mean, that person can be very important to you, but that doesn't mean you need to lead the same lives. Maybe I'd understand if I'd ever gotten that close for so long to someone. Someday, when I'm in that situation to understand, I'll erase this... but until then....        Anyways I still have massive amounts of homework to do so I should go. RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR God why don't I just become a freaking nun.  ***** I'd be quite the sexy nun....  I'd fly. I'd fight crime.  It's sounding better all the time!  'Cept for the no men thing. Dammit. There goes that idea...  I'd be the most atheist nun ever.

             Ohhh shit you don't know how sad I was two seconds ago. I tried to change the template on my site so people could comment on my posts (still trying to figure it out) and when I saved the changes what I had done, it was all messed up and all my entries were deleted and I almost had a heart attack. This is my SOUL, man. So I went back and retraced what I did and I'm not sure what I did wrong but it was very very wrong. I fixed it. Obviously.         Today there was no school. Didn't feel like it though. Cause by the time Charlotte came over to hang it was past 2 anyway. I guess I got to sleep more but still. We watched the second Matrix movie (bad) but Charlotte had to see it before she sees the 3rd one for her birthday (turning 17 and seeing a rated R movie in the theatre with her other legal friends.) Damn. I still have 3 months. Oh well. I saw the third one (with Dad.... god that's lame...) on Sunday. It was okay but pretty gory. My favorite guy saved the day. Well part of it. I really really liked the "16" year old kid who opened the gate. He was my favorite. I said that. He was so sweet. Wow I need a boyfriend.        I always sabotage any relationship I've ever had. Because I always find something that annoys me about the guy and dwell on it. And how he's not that perfect guy I have built up in my head... and I always listen to what my friends say. Hmm... well okay those who know who all I'm talking about maybe it's good i listened to you (though not quite in time) because none were ever even close to anything I want in a guy.... woah..... hold the phone.... they're ALL like, EVERYTHING I don't like... how did that happen? I think I lower my standards when there's possibility. Shit! It's true! Oh my god. What is wrong with me. And I look past all the things that would make me not like them because I don't want to sabotage this possibility. And then as soon as I 'have' them I realize these things and immediately dislike them. As I should have in the beginning because they're all wrong for me. Did that make sense...?      The only one guy who ever made me feel like I, Natalie, truly meant something to him as a person, graduated and moved away, before I could really tell him so.       A lot of guys are very frustrating because they don't care WHO their girlfriend is, they just want a girlfriend.        It's so incredibly hurtful and insulting and it's happened too many times.  I want someone who wants me to be his girlfriend because it's Me, Natalie. Not breasts and a cute face.         It's some comfort, I guess, that because of this, these certain guys rarely actually do get girlfriends, because even if a girl likes them, the girl realizes that he doesn't like her, he's just like that to everybody, so she disregards it. That's what I do anyway. I just immediately stop caring. A warning to all such boys (not guys, boys). Why bother with such fickle people?         My relationships with other people are the most important things to me. I just need to find someone else who's the same way.   lol... and someone who's hilarious, fun, smart, and musical, and sexy, and sweet... (this shouldn't be hard, right?) ******* I'd be very honored and surprised for anyone who read this far.. I just realized how long this is. I really don't mean to go on and on like I do when I write, it's just that I type so fast and I have so much I want to say that I kind of run away with my thoughts. Treat yourself to a cookie if you just read all that... and this for that matter. Thanks for caring about me enough to read all that shit that I just spouted off. You're awesome and I love you!

      I love this man... Give me a man with a beautiful voice before you ever give me one with bulging biceps.     *Although both would be nice.. ;)*  Check this out if you don't know why I love him. Copy paste, you know the drill. ---->  http://www.vh1.com/sitewide/videoplayer/index.jhtml?vid=19925&s1=az&s2=mraz_jason&adPth=/asm/adsetup/artists/az/&adPN=artist&isMac=true  Halfway Home -Jason Mraz  I used to walk along the opposite side of the road  ...and make others get out of my way I used to think I could sit and wait for the times  but they wont come until I meet them halfway I'm halfway home and I'm on my own I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind I plan to leave here after supper time  that's when traffic is light, all I need is a sign and I'll be alright. I'll be fine I used to think that i could just sleep and then I'd dream And everything it would come to me Until I woke one day without anything to eat Lying on the opposite side of the street  I'm halfway home and I'm still out on my own I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind Because it ain't my time to stay or say. I'll never lay down. I used to think that I could just sit and wait for the time But I know I gotta meet them halfway  I'm halfway home I tried home running with the flow I'm halfway there. Ain't it funny how everybody seems to care I planned to get there around supper time their serving up bread and wine All I needed was a sign and I'll be alright. I'll be fine. It seems to be a running theme about being fine and alright but I don't mind.

      You know, things always look up... just because I can still be upset about something (which I was totally over btw) doesn't mean that I can't have a sense of euphoria at the moment. It's like that Billy Joel song... it's either sadness or euphoria... actually that may be too pessimistic. I'm okay, really I am. But anyways I just got a replacement CD for the Billy Joel Greatest Hits I lost, and now I'm all happy. And a cool stipey hat with earflaps and pink pom poms. What could be happier than that? Hm... actually one may recall Catcher in the Rye... shit. Minus the pink pom poms. Hehe.  Blarg and then there's the Jason Mraz concert on Thursday, and I need to scrounge up bus fair (think I'm gonna drive myself and get lost in Seattle??? Just driving in those crazy streets are enough) so I can still buy a t-shirt and what-not... But anyway, it was a half day today, I had sushi with my sister and walked around in Target (cds!!!) and got hit on by strange man at the camera stand. *Shudder*. Well, there's no school tomorrow, that means I have to fight (for my right to paarrrtay) to get someone to sleep over tonight. Even though I got about 3 hours of sleep last night. Eh. I love days like today, cloudy rainy wonderful. I know I always say that I when I go off to college in the scarily close future, I want to leave, spend my college days in sunny California, or anywhere else. But I would miss days like this, Seattle days.  My old Nintendo system is calling me.... you know, I've never found any games on any of these new fancy systems as great as they made them for Super Nintendo. And I can still kick all ya'll asses on Mario Kart. (Hahaha, Zack, you thought you could beat me, but you were sorely mistaken!) Guys always think they can beat me at video games. Looks can be decieving. I may play the girly card but that doesn't mean that I didn't sell my soul to Super Mario when I was 5. Mwahahaha.  Wow talk about stream of conciousness. Hope that all made sense. I'm gonna sit by the phone and play Mario All Stars. Call me. IM me. Anything.  Lyrics of the Day:  Well they say there's a heaven for those who will wait Some say it's better but I say it ain't I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints Sinners are much more fun... Only the Good Die Young -Billy Joel

      I spent this weekend alone.... i drove to the mall.... i just like to drive... by myself... listening to music as loud as I want... walking around the mall ...by myself.... it was just all so lonely. I had a dream last night about someone that left me and i kept asking him is this real? and i really believed it was... i was actually thinking about how great it was that it wasn't a dream this time. then when it was just about to get good, i suddenly realized... wait this is a dream... and i woke up. I haven't felt like myself lately. Why does everyone find it neccessary to hurt me? What did I ever do to any of them? Why do I let people walk all over my trusting face. And I'll never learn. Like how I was just going to take back something I wrote earlier about how I wasn't gonna waste my time on certain people anymore... but why the hell would I do that? And I say these things but nothing ever changes... I'll still go out of my way to be nice to these people, and smile and act like nothing's wrong. I frustrate myself. So much. All I want is for them to tell me why. That's all I want. I don't want things how they were, quite the contrary. I just want to know why. I never do anything to anyone else that ever constitutes what they do to me. Oh well...dinner's ready...

      Today was such a good day. Not only did I not feel like blacking out (took ibuprofen this morning) but it just rocked. Maybe it's cause I had my cd player with me. Oh man it was so fun, 6th period I got to leave math for rehearsal for the assembly on monday (which is gonna suck btw) but then someone else was using my cello and you know what fuck it I don't know the songs I've been gone for two weeks they sound horrible and god dammit I deserve to sit out. It rocked, I just sat on the floor hoping Hibbard wouldn't notice while I listened to my cds and laughed at how horrible we sound. But I don't care. I'll just bullshit it on Monday and make fun of Jess for sounding like crap. Hahaha that was fun. Then me and Charlotte went to Earthcore and hung out at her house and pretended that we were going to do our homework, what a laugh. Literally, cause we can't be around eachother without cracking up. Good times.  This week has been interesting... most of all I've decided to just pull things together more.. you wouldn't believe how much homework I have. And I'm done wasting my time with pointless things. And people. I've wasted so much effort on people who will never return the favor. I'm too forgiving and I'm too nice. I don't know why I bother. So I won't.

      *Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes They call me on and on across the universe Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe Jai Guru Deva *  In Pottery we have to create a piece around a poem about light, and make light coming through it. I've decided to use this, the second verse of the Beatle's "Across the Universe". They're so amazing. I love them so much. Their music is the closest thing I can get to a religious experience. People who don't know can't understand how important they are to music and how much they mean to me. I grew up with them, knew all the songs by heart, from "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to "Glass Onion"... since I could talk. It's not obsession, it's love. They're like family, the voices of John Lennon and Paul McCartney are as familiar a sound as the voices of my parents. The rock gods that will forever represent the greatest band of any genre and any generation. Why am I so deep today?  PS. I would debate the hook on this version on the lyrics... it sounds to me like he's saying Ty Karoo Dayvla... not Jai Guru Deva... at all.  Across The Universe (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) Lead Vocal: John Lennon  Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind Possessing and caressing me Jai Guru Deva OM  Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes They call me on and on across the universe Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe Jai Guru Deva OM  Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Sounds of laughter shades of live are ringing through my open ears Inciting and inviting me Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns It calls me on and on Across the universe Jai Guru Deva OM  Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world  Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva (fade out)

      That's what I have. Why do I do the weird things I do? Don't ask me, not like I know. Why are you wearing legwarmers? Why are you wearing ballet shoes? Why are your earrings candy? Why is your purse a dog? Why are you so crazy!? Answer: Cause I'm just cool like that I guess. Get freaking OVER it. I know I'm unique, but I can't be anyone else. No one appreciates that I guess. What's wrong with standing out? Maybe I like to be interesting. Maybe I don't like how boring people are considered normal. Maybe I'm just too weird. Shit.

      So yeah in case you for some reason didn't know, I was in the hospital all week... weee.... Josh gave me meningitis! It sucked really bad. The hospital's pretty nice though. I liked the pushy button... ahhh... * I wouldn't have been that bummed about it except for that I missed yet another Halloween. I got home yesterday (Halloween) and I had no where to go. So I had door duty while everyone else was out having fun. No one visited me. That was the worst Halloween ever. And now I have soo much homework to make up. WHY THE END OF THE QUARTER!!! Least Ms. Germane is gone now.

      They say there's always someone prettier, funnier, smarter, thinner. Who is this perfect person and why do we always compare ourselves to them? I think this person ought to be stopped... killed... or... something. Everyone would concentrate on who they are, not who they ought to be or wish they were.

      Well til January anyway. This break will be so fun! Tomorrow is my mom's birthday and we're gonna see Lord of the Rings (.. just saw it yesterday... it's so long... and depressing... ah well I promised I would go). On Sunday me and Charlotte and possibly Nick, Josh, or Erinn are gonna do Christmas-y things like watch all the great Christmas movies and look at Christmas lights in my neighborhood and what-not. I guess the rest of the week will consist of shopping and... yeah shopping. Then it's CHRISTMAS!!! I'm always slightly sad on the actual day of Christmas... cause the season is over. Oh well. Every year goes by so much faster than the last. I usually spend the whole day playing whatever new video game I get, or listening to new cds (i'm still not done listening to all the ones I got last year). Then, there's the crazy week after Christmas where you don't know what the hell to do. You're like, it's not Christmas, it's not New Years, it's some crazy vortex! I would have a party, but strangely enough I have relatives coming.. (?) Natalie has relatives? Yeah my two cousins and my uncle are coming over, and I guess my Grandma too. And my Aunt Robin and Uncle Richard. These people haven't been to our house in 10 years. 'Cept Grandma who comes *all the freaking time*. They all live in California. So that week will be so amazingly busy... I've also started some sort of relationship with Ryan, from my art class ... 'Bout time I found a nice guy! :)  This break is gonna rock. Boop boop be doop~

      For the first time in forever, the sun shown and the sky was clear. There are still stars up there. They might have even gotten brighter. It smelled like Christmas. What is there not to be happy about?

      The second star to the right Shines in the night for you To tell you that the dreams you plan Really can come true The second star to the right Shines with a light that's rare And if it's Never Land you need It's light will lead you there Twinkle, twinkle little star So I'll know where you are Gleaming in the skies above Lead me to the one who loves me And when you bring him my way Each time we say "Goodnight" We'll thank the little star that shines The second from the right

      Ever have that subconcious feeling that you're just waiting for your life to start? But what exactly you're waiting for it's not clear. You just feel ...bored. Impatient. All you know is that when it happens, you'll know. Won't you...?

      Some lyrics on my mind, maybe they'll make one cuhrazy song. Jason Mraz, Train, Coldplay.  ...Satisfied by your seduction like a handshake would do the job Never know how long I have waited, anticipated your smile to be pressed against mine...  your smile pressed against mine  Bright lights, big city Was quite extraordinary. The drive was pretty. I was in perfect company. The love of a lifetime, Since we were elementary friends; The one with the bright eyes...  Why can't I be optimistic? I tried to find the logic logically. I had a dream and I could not shake it. I was standing up there naked.  There's fear in the truth at hand, frozen I forgot to understand The live keep living; growing older more into a man... And I let her grow away from me.  The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again. And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely.  A whisper You came back to haunt me and I realized That you were an island and I passed you by When you were an island to discover  I can see the red, white and free in you You light the night up like the moon And underneath your clouds, I see the blue   You're hopeless 'cause you tell the truth The stars are jealous of your shine If you were mine There's not a thing I wouldn't do    Sing it please, please, please, Come back and sing to me, To me,  me.  Cause after every day The wind blows the night time my way And I imagine that you are Above me like a star And you keep on glowing And you keep on showing me the way  Say it again. Lovely. So lovely....to do it again Again.  Loving again.  It's coming again... It's coming again Lalalalovely.

      I know I've posted this a thousand times, but it's on my mind... one of the greatest songs ever written. There was a clip on tv just now, they're doing this like Beatles night on Saturday on Vh1Classic (oh what's that? you don't have that channel? That's cause I just got digital cable! yeah baby!).   * When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be And in my hour of darkness She is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be Let it be, let it be Let it be, let it be Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  And when the broken hearted people Living in the world agree There will be an answer, let it be For though they may be parted There is still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be Let it be, let it be Let it be, let it be Yeah there will be an answer, let it be Let it be, let it be Let it be, let it be Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  Let it be, let it be Ah let it be, yeah let it be Whisper words of wisdom, let it be And when the night is cloudy There is still a light that shines on me Shine on until tomorrow, let it be I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be Yeah let it be, let it be Let it be, yeah let it be Oh there will be an answer, let it be Let it be, let it be Let it be, yeah let it be Oh there will be an answer, let it be Let it be, let it be Ah let it be, yeah let it be Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

      What a strange weekend... On Friday, there was a pep assembly and because I'm too cool for those (actually, my friends are too cool for those... i wanted to go! but apparently it sucked anyway) I stayed in the cafeteria. The pep assembly would have been preferable as I had to be in the same room as Andy, who I had decided never to talk to again for undisclosed reasons. But anyway, yeah Charlotte was sick so our plans were out to all go see the UW's production of Sweeny Todd, but I was going anyway because my mom and sister wanted to see it. Josh came too; we decided that at least we should see it, cause then everyone else could go with Charlotte (did you ever go, Char??? :(   ). It was the best production I've ever seen. It was soo awesome. Disturbing, but awesome. I think it closes tonight... otherwise I would tell you to go see it.  Yesterday I had a life drawing class at the Frye in Seattle; which if you didn't know life drawing means drawing naked people. Weee. I got some good stuff in I guess. I was fine when it was just the one woman, but then much to my dismay the gangly middle-aged man who I had assumed was a teacher's assistant actually turned out to be a model too. Hahaha... yeah. The class was 6 hours long (!) but it actually seemed shorter. There were only 7 people. After the class, me and Josh saw Elf (the second time for me sadly) and went to Barnes & Nobles to find Josh more of his gay-boy smut books (heh..jk love ya Fruit-pie!) and I got my mom a Beatles book (okay so I wanted it too...). Haha it was funny, we were trying to find his gay-boy books in the Relationship and Sexuality section, with me loudly saying repeatedly JOSH I DON'T SEE ANY HOMOSEXUAL BOOKS... heh. We got home without crashing or legal trouble (always a plus) and then proceeded to entertain Josh's buzzed parents and friends... it ended in a all-out guerilla warfare fight with towel whipping, and I got out alive. Lol. Today I had my class again, getting bored of drawing naked people... at the lunch break, at a weak moment, I walked to the McDonalds, which actually ended up being cool because I ended up eating with a guy in the class (1 of 2 lol), see no one in the whole class like talked at all the whole time so I was glad to finally talk to someone lol. He was cool, I gave him my number. Now I'm going out to eat and go Christmas shopping. I've been home like 3 hours besides sleeping this weekend. Bye~

      Why do people torture eachother? Why, when it is shared knowledge that two people like eachother, do they not drop those insecure nervous notions and just do something about it? This is a trial of adolescence that I'll never understand.

      This has been a weird week... I can't decide whether it's been a good one or a bad one. I finally came to the conclusion that I have to get out of Altman's class, I can't work so hard for a D, and try to conform to her teaching method that is the opposite of what I need. It sucks because I know I'm a good writer, and I understand her lectures and whatnot, but the impersonal teaching, the impossible anal-retentive tests, and her absolute refusal to help me at all (what does she have against me?) when I really need it, especially after missing two weeks last month. So yesterday I pretty much had a panic attack trying to finish that god-awful just-got-the-prompt-write-in-one-hour-in-pen-no-mistakes essay. I had a really good 3 paragraphs, but surprise i need 5. Even though my 3 are probably better than someone's 5 who wrote it in 2/3 the time. It won't matter to Mrs Altman because she's all about the technicality and her requirements. I'm out of that class. I'm done. I think an A in a regular class is better than a D in an honors class. So yeah yesterday sucked. Until I took a bath (which is weird cause I never have baths), while I listened to the JMraz live cd, then I watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and Charlotte called. (Thanks BeanDip! lol :D ) So, like my usual self, I just came to the conclusion that everything will work out and be okay.

      Today we got our Christmas tree! My family is dumb and always wants to get a dinky ass tree and put it in a new and ugly place in the room. Stick with tradition, people! We didn't get the thick tall bushy tree i liked. But it's okay. It's an okay little tree. We compromised.. Me and Josh went to Southcenter today, fun fun fun. We didn't really do anything, just walked around getting food samples and stalking hot guys... we followed this one guy for like 10 minutes.. he was gay and pretty like a girl. Good times. I bought earrings. Woo. I have other things to say but I'm not sure what they are. I'll keep you posted.

      Why are there so many Songs about rainbows And what’s on the other side Rainbow’s are visions They’re only illusions And rainbows have nothing to hide So we’ve been told and some chose to Believe it But I know they’re wrong wait and see  Someday we’ll find it The rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me  Who said that every wish Would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star Somebody thought of that And someone believed it And look what it’s done so far What’s so amazing That keeps us star gazing What so we think we might see  Someday we’ll find it That rainbow connection The lovers the dreamers and me  All of us under it’s spell We know that it’s probably magic Have you been half asleep And have you heard voices I’ve heard them calling my name Are these the sweet sounds that called The young sailors I think they’re one and the same I’ve heard it too many times to ignore it There’s something that I’m supposed to be  Someday we’ll find it The rainbow connection The lovers, the dreamers and me

      Today was so excellent! It started out a normal day... except that it was quite windy... orchestra and pottery went on as usual (gotta put 1000 coats of clear glaze on my Matrioshka doll! 990 to go....) but then third period the lights go out... which is not too phenomenally uncommon... but still exciting and hopeful...  after a fun 3rd period of darkness rocking out to 80s songs with Matt Hill and Justin Boggs... then after a dark period in the library and a darker lunch, Stubrud's on the intercom at noon telling us schools out at 12:15... a collective hollering is heard in the darkened Hazen halls... a triumphant moment in Mrs. Altman's 5 period honors class. I'm in ecstasy. I don't know why, it just seemed in retrospect a horrible unbearable thing to have finish the school day. Josh's power was out, as was mine until about an hour ago, so we sat downstairs by his old fireplace and plugged a CD player into a computer speaker and listened to Christmas music, talking about our Christmas memories and played a game of Life (BIH) which I won (6!!!) hehe... it was so nice, sitting there on the floor burning my butt by the fire. lol. Put me in the Christmas mood :) .  Then when I drove Nick home and we yelled at insolent middle schoolers.... lol. Later, as my house is big and scary when the lights are out, and we were about to resort to cooking chicken soup over the fireplace, we decided to go get pizza in downtown Renton and see Haunted Mansion (it's very strange... i'm not sure I liked it..). I got home at 9 and here I am talking to you. Or myself. Or whatever.

               Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high  There's a land that I heard of  Once in a lullaby  Somewhere, over the rainbow, skies are blue  And the dreams that you dare to dream  Really do come true   Someday I'll wish upon a star and  wake up where the clouds are far  Behind me.   Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  Away above the chimney tops.  That's where you'll find me...   Somewhere, over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.  Birds fly over the rainbow,  Why then - oh, why can't I?   If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,  Why, oh, why can't I?

      I feel unwhole. I feel like there's a whole facet of myself that no one has ever seen. I wonder if anyone ever will. I have a great capacity for love but no one to share it with. They say that day will come but will it? Why not now? I'm so tired of waiting, so sick of hoping. They tell you to have high standards but those who do are alone. Like me. Is it voluntary? Or if not voluntary, self-induced? It drives me crazy to think that it is. Even if I know that I'm doing the right thing. ...Especially so. I'd be so depressed right now if I was one of those girls who have to be defined by their boyfriend. I'm proud to be a self-sufficient, independent, and in all truth happy person; I know who I am, and I like who I am. But that doesn't mean I don't need somebody, need somebody to feel that wholeness that I've built up in my mind.

      Life sucks. Got my grades today.... let's just say their weren't stellar. I'm grounded for two weeks and I can't drive for a month, a whole month. Why am I such an idiot! Now I won't be able to drive til the end of February. Well, I guess the one perk is that when I can drive again, i can legally drive people. No this sucks. No more movie wednesdays at charlottes or going out to lunch or to the mall or on a date or ANYTHING. I never get to see any of my friends anymore as it is. I don't have classes with ANY of my best friends anymore. No more language with charlotte, josh, or caitlin or pottery with nick and erinn. Least I have Rachael in math now. Ugh life sucks.  Call me, please?

      Another week come and gone... We had a four day weekend last weekend, because finals were over... i can't really remember what i did.... oh right i slept over at charlotte's, we had a great time having a disgustingly girly night... we ate chinese and watched pretty woman, working girl, you've got mail... haha almost cliche...  that was great. Uh don't remember what I did Sunday... I think me and josh did something... but what... anyway on tuesday we didn't have school so me and josh went to Liberty to see his luver or should i say who he wishes was his lover... but yeah i thought we'd get lost so we left at 9:30 after tenni shoe registration but we didn't get lost... so we were there way before lunch so we spent an hour or so wandering the halls and being the crazy mutha fuckers we are... so I finally met Danny, he's a cool kiddo! We met a lot of cool kids... it was really weird because we ran into a guy i know from Camp Burton (also named danny) who had a crush on me... meh anyway. Josh tells me that Danny said that everyone was like "who were those crazy kids?" haha that was a fun day.  I started like all new classes this week, because i'm finally out of Altman's class which i'm conflicted about... because while i know i'd fail that class another semester i also know that i'm at a much higher level than the class i'm in now. Oh well grades are the most important. I have Journalism now and it's fun, it's like a team or a club more than a class, and Mrs Dietz is really really awesome. Anyways I'm tired now... i just came back from hanging out with charlotte and it's 11 and i need new contacts and i had to get up at 5 this morning for link crew. so to sum things up i'm tired.

      Wanna know how big a dork I am... this is Jason Mraz's online journal.... i'm not posting this to showcase my dorkiness .... but it's just so damn funny ________________________ Sunday january 11   Did you hear about the kid who got stuck inside the claw machine at the Sheboygan, Wisconsin Piggly Wiggly? What an honor. What a dream. That kid has no idea. Notice he wasn’t trying to get out. The only emergency they mentioned was that he had to use the bathroom. I wonder if they let him keep any toys from inside. I’m not sure he ever put his money in the darned thing anyway. Seven year olds. What I’d give to be seven again… at least my eight-year-old girlfriend would be legit. I’m just kidding. She’s eighty.  You know me and claw machines. We get along just fine. Though I have to admit, half the time I could care less what the heck is inside the box, I’m just down for a good old confrontation, man against machine. The same goes for those arm wrestling games, as puny as I may look I can usually get thru two or three rounds before someone notices I’m using both hands.   I’d rock one of those mechanical bulls too. They look a hell of a lot easier than real bulls and you get to land on a nice soft mat and you’re usually surrounded by a bunch of fools eating dinner on their birthdays, celebrating with the sing-a-long wait staff a happy birthday song parodied over a classic cowboy anthem.  I’m not poking fun and this ain't Sheboygan. I'm a real cowboy. You should see my signature hat to prove it. Plus, I ate the testes of a cow. Up here they call them “Rocky Mountain Oysters.” I’d rather just call ‘em what they are. Bull Balls. Yee-Haw.  Today’s post is making no sense. I wish I was one of those people who has an address book of all their friends and they send out an annual newsletter stating all the interesting things that makes life grand… our excellent drummer, Adam King does a hilarious one and I receive a few here and there from my iron woman friend in Greece who’s swimming and jumping and pedaling her way to the Olympics, but usually I delete all my mail and I’d worry that someone would delete mine, so I guess it’s best it just sticks up here on the site and annoys folks or whatever when I use run-on sentences and go completely nowhere with my words, heck, I could just blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and there you go, a’keepin’ on reading-a-long… sheesh. What was I thinking? I’m no cowboy. I’m a fast talking city boy.   Pardon me. I’m not from around here. Does anybody know where I can get a good ass whoopin’?

      I finished my article for the paper... what do you guys think?  THE SCHOOL OF ROCK By Natalie ******  The influence of music is everywhere. From the clothes we wear to the things we say, the presence of pop culture has become the fundamental basis of today’s society of American youth. You can’t turn on the TV without seeing the freshest face in the pop world giving shout-outs to his peeps, or cringing at the latest music video from your little sister’s favorite tween star.   	The idolization of musical artists definitely has been a distinguishing attitude of the twentieth century, and will most likely be true of the twenty-first as well. Pop culture is so central in our lives as teenagers, and yet there are few who truly know where it originated. How did music get to be what it is today? The musical evolution of the twentieth century, for better or worse, is a subject altogether unknown to those who are the most involved in it. So here’s a new subject to dwell on the next time you block out your history lesson with your personal CD player.  The History of Rock n’ Roll: a course often forgotten in high school curriculum. Take your seats, class; time to learn something new. Keep those headphones on, young man!  	After World War II, the sound waves were dominated by swing and easy-listening, by artists such as Frank Sinatra and Perry Como. However, soon a new sound developed in the South, popularized on the Southern radio scene. Performed chiefly by black musicians, this new sound combined R&B, boogie-woogie and country music, and involved the guitar, bass, drums, the piano, vocals and sometimes even a saxophone or horn. In 1952, an influential Southern disc jockey Alan Freed dubbed it "rock and roll", then a black slang term for sex. Got your attention? Let’s continue…  	Racism was still a difficult issue in the fifties, so the then-black dominated genre never took off into the charts until white musicians had a go at it. Haley's 1955 smash "Rock Around the Clock" is widely cited as the commercial birth of rock and roll. And then came Elvis.  	Elvis Presley was one of the forefathers of rock and roll. Elvis became a phenomenon that swept the youth of 1950’s America like no other artist before him. He brought the sound into the mainstream and shattered the racial barriers surrounding the genre. Blacks were fans of the King of Rock and Roll, as he later became known, just as well as whites were fans of influential black artists such as Little Richard or Chuck Berry. This opened the door for the golden age of rock and roll.  	The early 1960s started out slowly in the music world, with exception of the Beach Boys’ now classic California-flavored pop. Soon however, Berry Gordy’s primarily black record-label Motown became an unstoppable force, churning out many now -legendary stars, following a hit-making formula that has become the foundation of popular American songwriting. Such artists included Smokey Robinson, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Diana Ross and the Supremes, and Stevie Wonder. Other influential artists of the 1960s were Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, Simon and Garfunkel, and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, and of course Bob Dylan, considered by many the greatest American lyricist.  The most significant effect on rock in the 1960s was the British Invasion, which included such artists as the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Yardbirds, and the Animals. This movement was led by disputably the greatest band of all time, the Beatles. The mop-topped boys from across the pond, Liverpudlians John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, became great innovators of rock and roll. Their early chart-topping fun and simple Chuck Berry-esque hits on "Help" or "A Hard Day’s Night" evolved into thoughtful psychedelic epic rock albums such as "Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band" or "Abbey Road", by the end of their legendary careers when the band split in 1970. Their influence is still greatly heard in the music of today.    The seventies were all together considered a musical dark ages of sorts, lead by the fun and popular but basically empty dance music, disco. The genre was not without its innovators, however: the Bee Gees, Donna Summer and K.C. and the Sunshine Band are all included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Disco not your style? Want something with a little more edge? If this is the case, you might have favored the 1970’s alternative to disco: punk. Disputably founded by the New York Dolls and pioneered by bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash, punk music remains relatively unchanged and is a ascendant of a lot of the music we hear today. Rock, in its purer state, lived on in the seventies with a new wave of rock gods such as Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin or AC/DC.   	In 1980, MTV emerged, making the eighties the video-age. The music video put artists in the spotlight, and in 2004 seems to have become as important as the music itself. In the eighties, the music video became an innovative art with the talents of Michael Jackson, who broke the racial barrier as the first widely played black artist on the music channel, and was by far the biggest star of the eighties; his rivals were Madonna and Prince. To touch on more artists of the eighties would be tiresome, as it was also the decade of the ‘one-hit-wonder.’ It was an eclectic age ranging from the artistic to the absurd; from gender-bending hair bands to the birth of the now ever-present boy –band (think New Kids on the Block, New Edition, or Menudo). New Wave, a descendent of punk, also took off in this era.  	Remember the nineties? We were barely in grade school when the grunge movement, headed by the now legendary Nirvana, started here in our own backyard. Rap in this decade quickly rose to the top of the music world, but that’s a different story. The boy -band, to the ecstatic joy of American pre-teens and to the disgust of music purists, was the most successful industry of this decade, as we all can recall.   Today, as we are now fairly involved in this decade of the new millennium, pop culture has reached new heights. Clothing lines by hip-hop moguls are worn in school halls throughout America, endorsement of soda by pop-stars are of the biggest business deals in the world, and you don’t have to have a hit song to have a hit music video. God Bless America! Whether we are about to enter another musical dark ages or waiting for an upcoming revolution, you can decide.   That concludes our broadcast day. Maybe now, with your new-found perception of rock, you can take a look through your parents old CDs and records and find out how cool (or uncool) they really were back in the day. Just don’t let them catch you putting their retro rock in your own collection! Peace out yo, fo’ shizzle. ________________  What do you guys think? It's way too long (supposed to be 300-500 words, more like 1300) but it's hard to make something like that any more vague than I did.

      They always play this at the Senior Assembly at the end of the year, and it always gets me... probably because it's the Beatles. I'm always afraid that when I graduate, they'll suddenly say "Let's try something new" and not play it. Well anyways...  In My Life (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) Lead Vocal: John Lennon  There are places I remember All my life though some have changed Some forever not for better Some have gone and some remain All these places have their moments With lovers and friends I still can recall Some are dead and some are living In my life I've loved them all  But of all these friends and lovers There is no one compares with you And these memories lose their meaning When I think of love as something new Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more  Though I know I'll never lose affection For people and things that went before I know I'll often stop and think about them In my life I love you more  In my life I love you more

      Have you ever seen a shooting star?  I have a thing with stars. I always have. Even though the vastness of space is sort of scary, seeing it from here on Earth has got to be the most beautiful thing in the world. In my neighborhood on a clear night you can see every star. I've seen three shooting stars... in the summer I lie out in my backyard with good old Flash and just look at the stars. Stupid winter, can't do that. I've been missing summer alot lately.

      Long time, no update! Christmas has passed and so has New Years... this is usually a very depressing time for me, because I love Christmas, but you know, I'm glad for the rush to be over... that and it's less time till my 6 month secondary license is up. And my birthday is like two days after that. COOL EH? We'll be able to do something vehicle-related for my birthday. No more bus. But I like the bus... farewell sweet bus. But freedom is almost mine!!! Catch me that horizon. (Eh? Eh?)       No school today, snow storm... it's weird, I used to LOVE the snow. I mean, I still do, but I have absolutely no urge to play in it. I guess if any of my friends could make it to my house, then we could have fun, but it's impossible. I hope we don't have school tommorrow. Cause I'm procrastinating on the paper I'm writing right now. Blargh why do I have such a problem with homework?? K I really have to go. I guess.

      Tentative... yes tentative is what everything is right now. Meaning I guess that everything is okay verging on good right now... like things can go either up or down at any moment. Grades, friends, family... I'm just hoping it all goes up. It's nothing really specific I suppose... just little things, like people not making time for me lately, uncertainty about my future, sad that my b-day party doesn't look like it's ever gonna work not crucial I know, but it's important to me, I want everyone to have a good time and be able to go and stuff... and then just the whole thing with Justin and Peter dying... it's just really sad and it reminds us of our own mortality i think. Least I have yet another reason why I don't ever plan to ski again in my life... or uh get cancer.  Well anyway.. it's my birthday next Tuesday, 17... I'll have to go see a rated R movie. But even better than that is that I get my full license on Sunday! I told my mom it's Saturday though cause she's making me go to Mallorie's music scholarship audition on Sunday, no driving for me then. Not that I'll have anyone to drive around with on Saturday... cause everyone made plans that didn't include me... Oh well no biggie.. i can drive around by myself i guess

My neighborhood is the prettiest place on earth. I can't wait to be in the sunshine state next week... I just feel so... sunny! Donald Trump has a horrible toupee. Tomorrow's the last day of school before break. I have to give out Valentines (disney princess ones... yeah baby)... I have 30 Valentines, but have only 16 candys... favoritism will be the word of the day. Journalism is the best class ever. The paper comes out tomorrow... my article is sooo long so I look like a dork but it's about rock n roll so its okay... and we get a pizza partay but I'll be so hungry by 6th period. I'm babbling.

You know what's also awesome? I'm going to California on Saturday! I want to be in the sun right now. Today it was sunny and soo blue and even though it was cold I just couldn't be expected to pay attention during math class, when she sat me by the window and everything. It'll be so fun, we're staying in the Disneyland hotel and... uh going to Disneyland! Wooo! I love Disneyland. How many times can I say Disneyland in one paragraph? And American Idol is on now. What is there not to be happy about?

      GAA! Guess what??? Well you can't guess what cause.. you're not here. And you wouldn't know anyway! So just stop guessing (...moron...). We're starting to register for senior year classes, I don't have to take business classes (I thought you HAD to, but whatever) because I'm on the "art and music path", so that means I have a whole slot in my senior year free! So I went to see Mr. Grossman (art teacher) and he said I could do an independent art study and just like make up my own class! Yay!!! Then he asked me if I had any ideas for a senior project.. and of course no I don't even know what my Junior project is... and he wants me to paint a mural on the school! (!!) So awesome!!! I can't wait. I'm already thinking of things to do. I'm thinking a monkey, surrounded by dancing pineapples. Yeah... just kidding... damn.   Wow Josh your website should come with age restrictions, NC-17... for... not...c(k)osher....17. It's like reading a porno I never signed up to read. Your website should come in a paper bag......  :p Love ya!  Poo.... it's grey and dreary again. I really do love rain, but I'm ready for the sunshine. At the end of summer, I feel the opposite, where I'm sick of sun and want cozy rainy days, but NOT NOW. It'll be sunny by Friday apparently. :) I plan to have a good weekend.

      And she says "Please-- There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door I live on the corner of Grey Street.... And the end of the world"  There's an emptiness inside her And she'll do anything to fill it in And though it's red blood bleeding from her now- It's more like cold blue ice in her heart  Ever gets those moments of inexplicable desire to write, and to actually say something? I have the desire but not the energy... or anything of import to say. Just.. when I listen to music and hear the beautiful things they say, it just makes me want to write. And I love to write. But for some reason I'm not inspired... and I feel that to write something that really has substance I need to feel conflicted... and there's no conflictions in my life right now. Meh. Fuck it.

      I'm not prepared for another school week. It's too much. Kill me. My weekend wasn't nearly satisfying enough. ...Well, I guess I have mixed feelings about my weekend. On Friday, I thought I was doomed to be alone and bored all night but then last minute I brought a sleeping bag to Amanda's house and crashed there. On Saturday... It was a beautiful day and after getting my Dave Matthews / Jason Mraz tickets I was so happy and bouncing around my room (uh.. yeah don't talk to me I'm a nerd). I was planning to have Ryan come over but NOOO Mom and Mallorie just HAD to take MY car shopping. (???!). Depressing. But somehow I remember it was good day.. probably cause of the beautiful weather, and the tickets... and that I cleaned my room so it was all pretty happiness... So I lay in my room crashing out to DMB, thinking about what I could be doing, but not doing it. And then of course Sunday i had to do our video project with Lauren and Colin (kill me now) but since it was sunny I guess it wasn't that bad. EXCEPT I HAD TO STAY UP UNTIL 1 EDITING IT.   Ah Monday.. the most horrible day of the week. But there was  perk-- it was so warm and sunny I could have died happy. I slept in til 7:30 and rushed out of the door at 8... meh who cares about missing Orchestra. But with the lack of time and laundry I had to dress ...gasp... PREPPY. But good thing cause the cheerleaders all had to dress like "Rockstars" for tryouts, and damned if I'm gonna look like a cheerleader. Lol.  Anyways... weird thing happened today... talk about blast from the past... I saw Mike Tateishi today walking around the school (he graduated last year btw) ...I was supposed to be making up a test but I ended up talking to him for a bit... he's going to Iraq in two days (!!?)... stupid army guys. But... yeah... that was wierd... BLArgh I'm hungry and tired and broke. Not good things. But... it was sunny today.

      DAVE MATTHEWS BAND - Grey Street Lyrics   Oh look at how she listens She says nothing of what she thinks She just goes stumbling through her memories Staring out on to Grey Street.  She thinks, "Hey, how did I come to this?" I dream myself a thousand times around the world But I can't get out of this place. There's an emptiness inside her And she'll do anything to fill it in But all the colors mix together - to grey And it breaks her heart How she wishes it was different She prays to God most every night And though she swears it doesn't listen There's still a hope in her it might She says "I pray But they fall on deaf ears, am I supposed to take it on myself? To get out of this place? " There's lonliness inside her And she'll do anything to fill it in And though it's red blood bleeding from her now It feels like cold blue ice in her heart When all the colors mix together - to grey And it breaks her heart There's a stranger speaks outside her door Says take what you can from your dreams Make them as real as anything It'd take the work out of courage But she says "Please There's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door, I live on the corner of Grey Street And the end of the world. " There's an emptiness inside her And she'll do anyrthing to fill it in And though it's red blood bleeding from her now It's more like cold blue ice in her heart She feels like kicking out all the windows And setting fire to this life She could change everything about her Using colors bold and bright But all the colors mix together - to grey And it breaks her heart It breaks her heart To Grey   I'm so pissed. I just wrote so much and then I accidently clicked off the window and it was all ERASED. Wow between when I wrote that sentence and now it was like an hour cause I called Charlotte. So now I feel like writing again. OH SHIT i have to edit my video!!!!

      BWAHAHA. I got my tickets. Me and Char camping on Saturday Sept 4 near the Gorge, then seeing Dave and Jason on Sunday, then sleeping over that night and leaving Monday morning. It'll be the best way to end summer! Yay I'm so excited. Except... it's so far away. Dammit. Oh well. I now have something to look forward to.   Last night I finally found something to do and slept over at Amanda's. It was so lame... we were both tired, and we were like man it must be like 2... but it was 11:15. So we struggled to stay up til midnight.. then we slept. Pretty intense, huh? But I wasn't stuck in my house all night. ..But now I have nothing to do tonight. >;@

      WAAAAAA! Dave Matthews Band tickets are selling at 10 tomorrow morning!!! ERGH I have to go i have to! Guess who's on tour with them? JASON MRAZ! Holy crapmonkey.  It's at the Gorge. Haftagohaftagohaftago. I've never seen Dave live but if he's half as good as Jason live then I think I'll just shit myself. Now where to get fifty dollars...   I'M SO BORED. YOU GUYS SUCK. I JUST SPILLED WATER ON MYSELF. CRAP. I LOVE THE CAPS-LOCK BUTTON. EVERYTHING I SAY SOUNDS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MONKEYS. THERE'S A FRECKLE ON MY FINGER. THAT'S A WEIRD PLACE TO HAVE A FRECKLE. FRECKLE'S A COOL WORD. IT'S STARTING TO LOSE ALL MEANING. I CAN'T EVEN TELL IF I SPELLED IT RIGHT. I HAVE A FRIGGIN' MOLE ON MY LIP. I DON'T LIKE IT. I HAVE A MOLE BY MY EYE. WHY? BYE.

      Why do I waste my time being nice to people who have treated me like shit? Some people can't take hints. Some people think they're god's fucking gift to women. Some people are short and skinny and have stupid hair and big stupid emo glasses and think that they can treat some poor girl however they please, then act all buddy-buddy with her after she tried so hard to phase him out. SHIT. I'm so done with everyone who treats me that way. It's probably my fault if I'm all too ready to put my guard down. See there it is again- it isn't my fucking fault! Have a nice life. I'm DONE.  GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAjEiK:WJgeHIJMqfjNSVm.  Otherwise I had a good day.  Newspaper was out today... everyone liked my article on Freddie Mercury. I should probably try to think of something else to write about other than music. But for right now I was satisfied with it. We had a pizza-party today in Journalism and now I'm all full of happy pizza-goodness. And now I'm going to paint my nails blue and rock out to some White Stripes. I might even eat a Go-Gurt, even though I'm not on the Go. Hell, I plan to dance around my room in my underwear. Boredom does strange things to a girl like me. But I'm sad cause I'm sitting here on a Friday with no plans. Actually the only plans I have all weekend is to work on my video project with Colin Burton and Lauren Miekel on Sunday (don't ask me how I got myself into a group with the most annoying people in the milky way). But it's cool. I'll survive. They're nice people. See, some people are annoying and they are not nice people. Funny how life throws you shit like that.

      Looking back at this site, I haven't written one interesting thing in a while... I think it's because I maybe happier. Lol. When one is down brilliant poetic things come to their brain. But lately it's just been like," Oh today was boring. Should I cut my hair???" Holy crap. I need to be sad again. I write better that way. Like, look at like November or October. What was I on. Oh well. Oh and by the way, Today was Boring. Actually it wasn't. But I just wanted to say that.

      To go to school or not go to school... that is the question... it's a half day and i have just two classes for three hours... but the first one is orchestra and come on, that'd suck and it's pointless. But what to do tomorrow. If it works out, I'll steal Ryan from school and have lunch... hey Charlotte are we still having movie day tomorrow? I still have those movies we rented.  Oh wow.. Okay I'm watching the news and some sophomore tried to kill himself at Newport today. I was totally just by there when I went to my cello lesson. They were in lockdown for hours. Wow. I hope that kid gets some help.

      Half day half day half day. Just one more full day and then there's a halfday. I feel like I'm already waiting for school to wind down, and that's bad because it's March. Well in all fairness, the end of March. Which means... SHIT three more months. I can't take it. Well, by June no one's doing any schoolwork so I guess I can whittle that down to like a little more than 2 months of academic hell. Weekends are beginning to seem euphoriatic. Every Friday, I just drop everything and forget that I would ever enter the Hazen doors again. But that's what I want to do. Sweet release. I just don't do any homework. Like I ever do. I have some to do now. I really should do it. Cause then I won't be doing it at night and I can actually talk on the phone or watch tv or sleep. Oh.. yeah I'm gonna fail Chemistry again. I just failed the test today. Butt. I hate Chemistry I hate it I hate it. I don't need to know it. It's the sorriest excuse for a subject ever... >;@. I'll deal with that later. ( Today was the weirdest day. It around noon it was like 65 (felt almost 70) and all happy and warm, (why do i know this? we were all outside because some gangsta pulled the fire alarm), then, after school I walk outside to the parking lot and it's pouring rain! Not cool! It was ...WARM.. before. Oh well... now I'm all cozy in my pjs listening to New York State of Mind and contemplating watching a movie. Or possibly... doing homework. Oh yeah, Nick was back at school today too. Yay he's betta. It's a brand new day. I have a wedgie.  "Tonight, Not Again"  The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.  And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lalalalovely.  Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points As I'm all by myself tonight not again not againÉ  And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lalalalovely.  Well if you should nervously break down When its time for the shakedown would you take it It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice.  Lovely. Lalalalovely.  Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again Again. Loving again. It's coming again.... Lalalalovely.  -Jason Mraz  Rainy days and content put me in the mood for this song

      Old James Dean Monroe Hands out flowers at the Shop-N-Go Hopes for money but all he gets is fear And the wind blows up his coat And this he scribbles on a perfume note "If I'm not here, then you're not here" And he says, "Call me Miscreation, I'm a walking celebration"  And it's hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand  My friend, o lawdy, Went to take care of her own body, And she got shot down in the road She looked up before she went, Said, "This isn't really what I meant" And the daily news said, "Two with one stone" And I say, "Hey there, Miscreation, Bring a flower, time is wasting"  And it's hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand  We got loud guitars and big suspicions, Great big guns and small ambitions, And we still argue over who is God And I say, "Hey there Miscreation, We all need a revelation"  And it's hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand Hard to make a stand  -Sheryl Crow

      I just saw the most amazing movie, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Go fucking see it. It was the most interesting movie I've ever seen. I think I need to see it again just to fully get it. Any takers? Actually my whole weekend pretty fucking rocked. Me Charlotte and Erinn saw Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen that I am ashamed to say that I really liked... then we went to the Mongolian Grill in Southcenter... and got lost coming home... I swear to God it wasn't my fault this time! Believe it or not. Erinn told me to go South instead of West. The whole time I was thinking about how I didn't recognize anything, then a sign was like You are Entering SeaTac and I was like Hey you guys, we're almost in Tacoma. Hey, look, here's Wild Waves. FUCK!. Yes so that was funny but we made it home alive. And we got two movies (Mickey Blue Eyes and.... She's All That...

      I love this song. It reminds me the lazy summer days I spent last year, the best summer I can remember. It's so dirty and yet it's done so tastefully that it's like a beautiful poem. Or maybe just beautiful porn. Either way I love it.  Crash Into Me Dave Matthews Band   You've got your ball, You've got your chain Tied to me tight, tie me up again. Who's got their claws In you my friend? Into your heart I'll beat again Sweet like candy to my soul Sweet you rock, And sweet you roll Lost for you, I'm so lost... for you  Oh, and you come crash into me  And I come into you And I come into you In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  Touch your lips just so I know In your eyes, love, it glows so I'm bare-boned and crazy... for you.  Oh, and you come crash into me Baby, and I come into you In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  And if I've gone overboard Then I'm begging you To forgive me In my haste When I'm holding you so, girl, Close to me  Oh and you come crash into me, yeah Baby, and I come into you Hike up your skirt a little more And show the world to me Hike up your skirt a little more And show your world to me In a boy's dream In a boy's dream  Oh, I watch you there Through the window And I stare at you You wear nothing, but you Wear it so well Tied up and twisted, The way I'd like to be For you, for me, come crash into me, baby Come crash into me, yeah  Crash into me... Crash into me... Crash into me...  You know, I'm the king of the castle, You're the dirty rascal, crash into me. Please crash into me, baby...  Oh, no no no... Yes, I see the waves Come and crash into me. See the waves come and crash into me. Crash into me

      Wow it's 8 and I've been at my house for about 15 minutes tops at my house. Me and Jordann cut 6th period Journalism today (sub), i drove around Renton making sure I knew the way to the Renton Village theatre (and guess what??? I DO!!!) then I went to Charlotte's to hang with her and Zack, and totally kick Zack's ass at MarioKart... lol I am STILL the master... then me and Charlotte went out cruisin', and picked up Erinn on the way, and spontaneously went to the mall... to do nothing... oh wait not nothing I got this horrendously awesome Elvis clock, the legs move back and forth! *Uh huh huh*. Oh shit it's cool. I put it above my massive wall of CDs. As soon as I got home at 6:30 I had to take Jeana and her little friends to McDonalds and to their dance.. ..LOL. Elementary school dance. Holy crap that just tickles my funny bones to no end. It's like a ho-down. Sigh funniness. See Jeana made me take her cause it's cooler than Mom taking her. Lol. And now I'm doing this. Up to speed? Good.  Charlotte/Erinn: Girl night tomorrow! YAY! Chick flicks and grape soda all the way. Hell yes.

      Watching American Idol... procrastinating on everything... eating a graham cracker... wearing monkey pajamas... typing on an orange computer... I should turn this into a song, yo.  No more school. Just make it stop. I must have slept through every class today. Then I went home and slept some more. And well that wasn't very smart cause now I have homework and it's past nine, and shit. Maybe I should go to bed earlier. Naw. That would just make too much sense, and I don't feel like making sense right now. Or ever.

      I realize that because I don't update this enough anymore no one bothers to read it... but this is still my quazi-journal and so I might as well write entries with a little substance. I dont know. Life is wierd right now. I'm not sure where I stand on anything. School, family, girlfriends, boyfriends. It's like a wierd transition period for everything. I want everything to be as it was, or as I always wished it was... depends on what subject we're talking about. I just want things to be .. normal. Whatever that is. I want to feel like I matter to somebody. I hate drama, I hate my friends being mad at me, or being mad at them. I feel like I'm long overdue for a heartfelt talk with every single friend I have. Am I not making time for them or are they not making time for me? I want to paint. I wish I had the energy and time and patience to do art all day, for hours, and have something come out of it. I wish college wasn't so close. And yet I don't want to wait anymore. Charlotte, Erinn, we have to have one of those stupid girl nights and see Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. Don't pretend that you don't want to see it. Lol. One of those nights where you stay up til the sun comes up and the birds are chirping because you talk all night about absolutely everything. Talk about Erinn's recent indiscretions with a certain BOY (yes boy). I wish it was last year. I wish it was next year. I wish it was summer and I was going to burton, or coulon beach. or newcastle beach. Or charlotte's house. Or caitlin's house. And I still have to see a rated R movie! I'm 17 now, god dammit. But tomorrow's another day. jgi;ajgie;ajg;;baiejuoiwae;fjjakncxm,z You heard me.

      DAVE MATTHEWS BAND - Captain  Crazy as I may,  Make my way through this world,  Oh, it's for no one but me to say,  What direction I should turn in now.   Cause I am the captain of this ship,  Wanting eyes and kissing lips.  The same as it was,  And will remain until I'm done and gone.   Strange, but it seems,  There's mutiny brewing inside of me now.  I don't want your pity,  Just the promise that I'll be alright.   Cause I am the captain of this ship,  Curious hands and fingertips.  The same as it was,  And will be until I'm gone.   Oh, I know I'm a dreamer,  Still think it's strange?  I won't be here for long.  Oh, I know that I feel,  Oh, wait and go again, Again.   Oh, look, I'm buried,  Like a cancer eating away inside of me.  I don't want your pity,  Only the promise that I'll be okay now.   But I am the captain of this ship,  Curious hands and fingertips.  The same as it was before here,  Here, back after all.   Why should I be hypnotized,  By the promise of a long life?  Why should I hold hope,  In tiny, tiny dribbles that glide by?  Why should I lean on everything... upon  I won't be here long....   Oh, I know I'm a dreamer,  Still seems a truth.  I won't be long for here.  Oh, it's so, but I think I lay this,  On now your lips.  I'm drowning.   I am the captain of... oh... But, I'll be okay after all

It's SO SUNNAY. I need more warm-weather clothes. I thought it was Friday all day, imagine my disappointment when it came to my attention that it was indeed, Thursday. Oh well. I'm trying to plot out my weekend which is so close yet so far.  *One hour later...* Wow that's depressing.. I just got off the phone with Ryan and he's grounded and can't call me or IM me or hang out with me this weekend *AGAIN*. Sigh. nv,ag3wiuh;a,j. And I have no money and my car is out of gas. That's not cool. But now I have no reason to  fill it up. This is very depressing. Well, now I can go be with Charlotte on Saturday and do her make up and stuff... This is very depressing.

      I don't have to go to school until 9:45 tomorrow so i'm still up. Hm I have nothing to say so i'm not sure why I'm posting anything. I'm just bored. It was SO sunny today and i wanted to explode in my socks. Bugga boo bugga bee bugga wtf am i writing. ......If I ...were the king... of the foRAAAAAAAAST... then that would be one ROCKIN' forest.               Art Club today, didn't work on anything cept maybe added green stripes to my sweater on my self-portrait. My mom is signing me up for CRAZY amounts of art classes but I'm glad because well I gotta be all prepared and experienced and shit. ..... ........   .....GET ME OUT OF THIS SCHOOL GET ME OUT OF JUNIOR YEAR I WANT TO BE A SENIOR I WANT IT TO BE SUMMER I WANT TO GO TO BAND CAMP AND GO TO CONCERTS AND ROAD TRIPS AND COULON AND CAMP IN MY BACKYARD. Wow sorry for that outburst but I'm sure you feel the same way. It's just I've been thinking about the Dave Matthews Concert and I'm sooo soo soo excited but it's so far away.. it's at the end of summer which is weird.. we'll have a whole summer filled with fun before that. It'll be an awesome way to end it though. This will be the greatest summer ever because I can DRIVE and I'll be home more than most summers, cause you know, we're not going to Iceland, or any crazy place like that.  GAH this year needs to END. END END END. I've decided you guys: Last day of school, we'll do our whole Seattle thing like always but then we're camping out in my backyard! IT'LL BE CUHRAZY! Well maybe not but YEAH! Sigh it's too far away to be making plans. No it's not don't talk like that.               Oh Charlotte left tonight, she's been staying with us since Sunday cause her Mom was in Las Vegas. We went to the mall and put her dress on hold, (it wasn't gone, yay!) and Saturday I'll come over and make her all purty and whatnot. Cause that's just what best friends do. Do eachother's makeup and watch Indiana Jones. Hehe. Yah good times. I should sleep now cause I haven't gotten much lately. It's so hot in my room! *stares at lava lamp for 4 hours*

      Hey ya'll.. hey guess what I got some sleep, and I'm actually feeling sort of Natalie-ish today! Yay! Banana monkey pineapple facehead. This whole week we get to come in at 9:45, except tomorrow because of Link Crew, but on Friday we get to sleep in when everybody else has to go see a seminar on HIV/AIDS. They're like, Link Crew don't get AIDS. You'll be fine. Show the freshmen where LA 101 is, Wear a condom. That's our motto. So anyways. I got the new Prince CD, which also is making me happy. And I affirmed that we have a half-day next week, which always promises fun and happiness. And Charlotte's staying at my house all week cause her mommy's in Vegas, and we're having fun chillin', and pining after this gorgeous dress I picked out for her to go to Prom in. It's so pretty (well i picked it out) but I won't describe it in the unlikely case that Nick should look at this. So yeah. I'm feeling better and I have the best boyfriend ever. Cause I am the Proudest Monkey

      Weekend's here, and there's nothing to do. I'm so bored and I absolutely hate being bored. Everyone's doing something except me, and with other people besides me. So I'll sit inside on this beautiful day and watch Wayne's World 2 cause that's just how cool I am. I just got back from the carwash we put on to raise money for the school newspaper. Fuuuun. Screaming on the side of the road with a crappy sign getting whistled at by Mexicans and 1/200 cars get their car wash. That's my idea of fun right there. Least I got my car washed. Sigh. Maybe I'll go shopping... by myself... with no money... hm maybe not. You think I could be creative enough to think of something besides shopping to do but sadly I can't.  Yesterday me Erinn and Josh saw Connie and Carla, it was cute, and definitely for gay guys. Lol. Then we watched Kill Bill Vol. 1 and wow.. it's so gory. Wow. Oh I did a good deed yesterday. I was filling my car with gas, and there was this poor doggie (with a collar) all scared and being stupid and walking around all confused on the very busy intersection of Coal Creek, and after almost getting hit by a couple cars I got him to the gas station and this nice woman was like "oh poor thing I'll buy him a hot dog" and the owner said he could stay there, and well my car was still by the stalls, so I left then... I hope the doggie's owner came looking for him. As long as he didn't turn into a dog-pie on the road.  Oh yeah yesterday was the DUI presentation at school... everyone heard that apparently it would make you cry, but we were like dude it's not real. See, they set up a mock accident, with two crashed cars and some students as actors all bloodied up and yeah. It was actually pretty gory. Like a million ambulances and firetrucks and police cars were there to "help" and yeah it was pretty hardcore. Then we had an assembly and everyone was crying because of this poem this guy read.... it was a good presentation. Good thing I never do drugs or drink alchy-hol! I rock.  I'm still bored.

      I'm bored. Bored bored bored bored. Car wash tomorrow for Journalism... have to be there at 10. Blah. I should probably go to sleep soon. Connie and Carla was funny, especially if you're a gay man. Goes without saying that Josh liked it. Hehe. Then we watched Kill Bill Vol.1 and HOLY CRAP it's so gory. Wow. But now I have to see the next one. Charlotte's gonna live here for a couple days next week, her mom's going somewhere. I can't stand her. It's gonna be hell. JUST KIDDING! Sleepover every night! Except.. not.. cause like we have school. Yeah. Oh I was asked to make the backdrop for the Battle of the Bands... I also wish I had the balls to try out for it. Dammit. It's not really bands specifically but like a talent show that's just music. So I could sing. Josh thinks I should but yeah... this whole year I've been imagining singing in a talent show but when the oppurtunity comes up I split. Sometimes I hate myself. Sigh.

      Wow that's depressing... I know I made a new entry at like 3:30 but for some reason it's not there. I can't even remember what was in it. Oh well! So yeah... it's Thursday! That means tomorrow's Friday and THAT means that it's almost Saturday. Which is one more week over til summer. Tomorrow I think the gang's gonna see Connie and Carla tomorrow, you know the one with the women-pretending-to-be-men-pretending-to-be-women. I guess other than that I don't have plans... that's depressing too. But I'll find something to do. BLAAAAAAAAH. Haha yesterday me, Char, Nick and Josh went to the Hazen pool, I haven't been there in YEARS. Since freshmen year when we had to swim in P.E. I'm not the best swimmer in the world but it was fun. We all discovered that my belly button is slightly off-center, as Charlotte so aptly screamed down the hall. THANKS GUYS. I'M A FREAK, JUST SAY IT.

      Prince's new album Musicology comes out today... I have no money and I'm reading reviews and it's supposed to be AMAZERING and I'm sad. No money whatsoever. Then Jason Mraz tickets are on sale Saturday... again, no money. Wow I need to get a job.  Sigh.. well we're back at school... it can't be that bad because the next two weeks is WASL testing for the lower-classmen and that means LATE ARRIVAL for juniors and seniors! School started at 9:45 today.. somehow I was still late... hm. Well maybe it's cause I gave in and gave Charlotte, Nick AND Josh a ride to school. Yeah that'd do it. Well.. tomorrow I have to go in earlier for the Link Crew meeting at 8:00... still beats the fuck out of 7:20. I miss Spring Break.. it was just starting to get fun and then it died. I'm not sure what to make of my week... some of it sucked really bad and other times it was the best time ever... well that was only really two occasions and one of them was also the worst day ever. But then Charlotte slept over and that was great. Then Saturday was awesome. But.. now.. it's TUESDAY. Tuesdays suck. It was a weird day.. right after first period we had lunch, very strange. Then in History we watched this video on the Holocaust... sigh... i was crying for the rest of the day, thank you very much Mr. Page. I'd get into it but I might start crying again. It wasn't as graphic as some that I've seen but... it doesn't need to be. I can't think of anything more horrible and inhuman than that dark period in human history. Crap I need a tissue now. No one noticed or asked why I was upset but then again that's nothing new. Felt antisocial today. Meh. I couldn't go see Ryan today, felt bad, put me in a worse mood... and then I slept for like two hours which I never do in the day because now I won't be able to go to sleep... Yeah today kinda really sucked. I need a hug. But... there's no one here. There's not even anyone to talk to.

      Wooow i'm sooo tired...  My legs are achey and it's really sad that they are. Went to the zoo with Ryan today, really super fun. Big monkeys and happiness everywhere. I made friends with the biggest orangutan, he was being a hobo under a blanket he was so cute i wanted to take him. He kinda looked like this:     Yeah. He was awesome. But yeah I'm so tired. Why am I up? Uh... bye!  PS. I think Charlotte needs a shout-out~ I LOVES YOU!

      Why am I so goddam tired lately. I need to like, not be out doing stuff for like two seconds. Or I could get more sleep. That'd be good. I've been up til 3 on the phone for the last two nights... hm... Maybe that's why I'm tired. I watched West Side Story last night... I love that movie, it's like the best movie ever. I didn't finish it... Maybe I'll do that tonight. Wait I gues I'm supposed to sleep over at Rachael's with Caitlin and Amanda.. but I'm too tired :| -_- maybe I'll go and just come home late. Today was Nick's surprise b-day party, he wasn't incredibly surprised but it was fun anyways. Woo... I'm sleepay.

      Siiiiigh.... I'm tired... very very tired... Spring break... woo... I've been busy everyday and I'm getting very burnt out, which is surprising cause I usually think that I always like to be busy. On Monday the usual gang came over... No one was in the best of mood so I'm not sure why we bothered... well Charlotte slept over and I really needed that... Char you're the best friend ever. Blah... I feel like I'm under a cloud... I must have some inferiority complex to think that everyone else but me has the right to act for themselves and not care what they say to people or how they make them feel.... but if i do, i feel incredibly guilty and feel like everyone must immediately hate me. But I never think anyone else has to feel that way. What's wrong with me. I'm not sure what I did to not have the same priveleges... Oh i remember it's because I'm a pushover. I remember now why I never confront anyone with anything. I'm very bad at conveying how I feel and it makes it worse when they don't try to stop and think of what I'm trying to say... I can't stand people I love being at all upset with me and somehow anytime I have anything of gravity to say it just backfires... so... I'll just stick with dealing with my own problems as always. It's not worth this. There's a lot more I could say that I'd like to but I've learned that sharing your feelings only makes people you love mad at you if it's not what they want to hear. But I will say one thing...for whatever reason that I can't even think of, I'm sorry and I love you all

      Hey ya'll... It's EASTER and it's also SPRING BREAK! It's off to a good start... on Friday even though I was all sicky me Charlotte Josh and Nick went to Coulon Park ("Come with me, come with me! We're almost there!"), it was sunny and we had good times... then on Saturday I went shopping with my mom because she wanted to reward me getting good grades by getting a new outfit... but then it came to me that instead of that.. I would rather have my reward be Prince tickets... I'm not sure why that didn't occur to them earlier cause uh I've been bugging them about it for like two weeks.. but... I GOT PRINCE TICKETS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm sooo excited!!!! Yaaay! I got really not great seats but they were the best available... but I really don't care. Then... I got my hair cut again... it's really cute but I'm sad that I spent all that time growing it out just to have it cut off again. Oh well. I'm a short hair girl anyways. When I got home I went to Charlotte's.. we decided to drive around but then we were like let's pick up Erinn... and then we picked up Josh.. we went to Southcenter and messed around... then we went back to Charlotte's with Taco Bell and decided we must chill at Kuwanis (sp) Park down the street... and who should be there but like all the drama kids (i.e. Charlotte's drama people, i.e. people I tolerate but not neccessarily love, i.e. people I don't want to see without their shirts but somehow it happened) they were playing ultimate frisbee (? it was about 10 pm)... yeah but that was fun. Even though I'm not going on a vacation for once on a break, I'm liking it, I plan to do something every day, so far it's working. Well today's a family day cause it's Easter... I'm all full'a chocolate and eggies....lol we're going to go see Hellboy (???). Blasphemous? Oh well. Happy Easter everybody!

      Stayed home today... everytime I move my head around I get all lightheaded. Watched like 5 movies. Good stuff.  One more day of school and then it's Spring Break... I have no plans but as long as I don't still feel like shit I plan to have a fucking good time. On my check-list: See at least 3 movies. Search for a job. Go to Coulon. Go to Newcastle Beach. Go spring shopping. Have Charlotte over. Go to the zoo. Go downtown. Do nothing. Eat chinese food. Pick up a new cd. I can tell after break that I will immediately lose all will to stick out the end of the school year and I'll keep thinking that summer is closer than it is. Even still, I can't fathom that people that have been names I've known all my life will be gone forever; seniors will graduate, including my sister, and some of my best friends. There are people that I don't like that I want to tell off but I never will, and part of me wishes that even those people would stay in my life, if not just for familiarity's sake. I've finally reached that point in my life that we all face,  adulthood and having to deal with losing all that beloved familiarity. After this summer nothing will be the same. All those times in elementary school when we all used to say "when I grow up I want to....."... That's no longer in the future. And this will be my "last" summer. I think it will be the best one yet.

      Gbheiablja... Why do I feel worse than I did yesterday? This morning I felt okay, except that I was very not happy that the clothes I put in the dryer last night weren't dry in the morning... so I threw something on... felt very unpretty today. And I felt stuffy. All and all it was a down day. After school was Art Club's first meeting, 10 people.. woo. Sounds like I'm gonna be teaching half of them how to paint. (...) Today was Wednesday which is me-and-charlotte movie day... I felt really lightheaded and headachey so I went home after watching an hour or so of Vh1. When I got home I tried in vain for ten minutes to vanquish a huge fly from my room, but eventually I prevailed and he now lies dead and squished on my windowsill. Ew. I should probaby do something about that. But yeah... and then I slept... and I just got up... I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. Fuck. But maybe I won't go to school tomorrow.  Hm... I'm getting another haircut from someone good (=more expensive... :| ) but I probably have to cut it short again... not like pixie-cut short but.. pretty short... Makes me mad because I spent so long growing it out and then that stupid asian lady just ruined it. Gr! Bout to pop some caps. But yeah right now I feel like crap and I'm gonna zone in front of the tellay now.

      Cough.. sniffle.... ....smile.... Yes I am home sick today, and goddammit I deserve it. I am so bored. But I like to be bored. Because I have 100000 movies to watch and 1000000 minutes to waste. And I didn't do any of my huge load of homework yesterday, and I didn't do my laundry, and I feel crappy, ...and I feel like watching Aladdin, so this morning I was just like I'M STAYING HOME.  *              *               *  I don't want to think about school so I'm gonna think of things I want to do over Spring Break. Ummm... *mind goes blank*.... well it's Nick's birthday one of those days, don't know what's going on with that yet.... um..... wow that's kinda it. Oo I want to go to the zoo. Who wants to go to the zoo with me??? Haha the last time I went to the zoo was two years ago with my old southern grandpa.... "Nadlie, I want to see th' monkahs". Haha he's awesome. But yeah I want to see the monkeys! It's fun going there when it's all sunny. So yeah... what else... If it gets really nice, me and Charlotte and Erinn should camp out in the backyard! Yeah... wow I'm really bored.

      I didn't .... get... Prince.... tickets... The world is officially over. His video for Musicology was on the Soul music-video channel, and it hit me that I had the chance to go and see this wonderful musician who I love and it's his LAST TOUR and he's gonna be RIGHT HERE at the Key Arena.... and I'm gonna be sitting at home. Not there. AND I HAVE BEATLE HAIR. How could things get worse. And I think I'm getting sick. I'm considering getting highlights. Or get a purple or pink streak. Or shaving it all off. Sexy.

      One more week til Spring break... I just might explode. Anyway, it's Sunday and that means Monday looms ever closer. But I had a fun weekend anyway.. cept for that awful haircut I got yesterday... gr... Sue, sue I tell ya! Well I guess I fixed it for the most part but... gr. On Friday... lol that was an interesting day... it was sunny and warm... me and Charlotte wanted to go to the park but Erinn wanted to go to the mall to see if that girl was working at Spencers... well we went to Southcenter and she wasn't there of course... so we went to Taco Del Mar and had burritos. Charlotte's mom was gonna be at her bf's house all night so she invited us to spend the night with Charlotte. Oh yeah... my guinea pig died. Right before we left to go get Erinn I went up to the cage and... yeah.. My mom was really upset because she loved that thing. I'm sad he's gone, we had him for so long, but he was older than guinea pigs are supposed to live and he had cancerous tumors and stuff, so it's probably about time.   ....ANYWAY...  At Charlotte's... Erinn brought her digital camera and a bag of fabric and clothes that she wanted to alter and sew and stuff... I didn't feel like it so i just put on a bunch of the fabric and we took some funny pictures... We got bored around 9:30 so we went driving... never drive with Erinn. She's a crazy-ass driver. Oh my god. We almost got kicked out of Safeway (apparently you can't take pictures... or, you know, throw food etc)... then Target was closed... but haha we pulled into a parking spot opposite this couple making out in their car.. that was great... *deer in headlights*... we had these cap-guns (don't shoot anything but make a loud noise and a spark) that we took funny pictures with (Erinn's a gangsta, yo) but yeah uh this cop started following us... i think it was the flashing camera and the sillhouette of a cap-gun.... yeah for like 10 minutes.. that wasn't cool... actually it was pretty funny... Good times.  Yesterday I had a bad haircut at Hairmasters (i look like a friggin Beatle.. not to diss them of course, but I don't want to LOOK like one!!! >;@) then washed it out and dried it myself... then me and Jeana went to the mall and I got this really cute pink dress for 15 bucks (sorry that was waaay too ditzy a sentence.... wow...). Had a date with Ryan, we had yummy ice-cream and snuck into Eternal Sunshine... just as good as the first time, maybe even more interesting the second time. I now have ticket stubs for Secret Window. Ate go-gurt, you know. Then I fell asleep watching "Sleepless in Seattle". A fulfilling day.  I woke up this morning at what I thought was 11:30 which was actually 12:30 (did everybody set their clocks today?) and watched Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window, which is the best Hitchcock movie if you ask me.. but basically yeah I'm on my ass all day. Fun.

      It's Monday.. the last day of the glorious 3-day weekend... I feel like it's Friday and I should still have three more days, I've been so busy.  (from -5 to +5) Friday: +3 Saturday: +5 Sunday: +3 Monday: WHO KNOWEWSOWS?!!!  Well it's already 2:30 and so far it's been kinda really dull and unpleasant. Stupid Mallorie was being weird when I had to go pick her up from her friend Shana's b-day party, and she wasn't ready and they wanted me come in to play DDR which I suck at and don't like, and I hadn't taken my shower and was very tired and cranky and didn't even want to get out of the car but of course because she never answers her cell phone I had to go to the door in my pajamas, then she got all pissed off at me because i was being "unpleasant", well excuse me I'm so sorry for going out of my way to pick your 18 year-old ass up. She needs to get her damn license! It's been like 5/6 of a year since I've gotten mine and my older sister still doesn't have hers, and actually hasn't improved on driving skills either cause she never asks to drive when she goes places, which is not that often. Wow I'm rambling and you guys don't care. But this is my outlet so DEAL WITH IT. Hm i'm not in a good mood today. So far it's -1.

Right now I'm headed to the mall, I'm gonna go get a new skirt and pick up some more applications.... so far I have one from PetCo and Papa Murphys. I'm thinking that I should get one from Nordstroms, and try to look into some waitressing jobs. My mom says that's a good job just for experience sake. Then I'm hanging out with my boyfriend tomorrow, :D and then on Sunday Charlotte's spending the night, and on Monday we're all gonna go see some movie... YAY then only 14.5 more days of school! I wish it was sunny... but oh well! The rain makes me all cozy and sleepy. Well bye bye!

      I just came back from Battle of the Bands... I was suprised by some people (Jeremy and Nipert? Who knew?) and then not as amazed as I thought I would be by pretty much all of the solo singers... God DAMMIT i should have tried out. Siiiiighhhh. Next year. Next year. And I won't sing some crappy ass song like Britney Spears' "Not Yet a Woman". I'll sing Beatles, baby. That was depressing for me, because I was sitting there thinking THIS SUCKS and because I blew it. AH WELL NEXT YEAR We got our yearbooks today, hooraaay! My picture is very bad, but then again, isn't it always? Well, I slept over at Caitlin's the night before and didn't get all pretty for the picture... yeah... And there's this huge picture of me on the Orchestra/Band page which uh I guess is cool but um yeah. And I'm on the fashion page, whoopee. No sports for me this year. That's weird. I thought I would miss soccer more than I do. But i don't! And tomorrow's Friday and that means the next day's SATURDAY and then we have TWO more days of no school! Then it's only 15 1/2 more days!!!

      I'm back! Why am I still up? I dunno!   Miami 2017 --Billy Joel  Seen the lights go out on Broadway I saw the Empire State laid low. And life went on beyond the Palisades, They all bought bright Cadillacs- And left there long ago.  We held a concert out in Brooklyn- To watch the Island bridges blow. They turned our power down, And drove us underground- But we went right on with the show...  I've seen the lights go out on Broadway- I saw the ruins at my feet, You know we almost didn't notice it- We'd see it all the time on Forty-Second Street.  They burned the churches up in Harlem- Like in that Spanish Civil War- The flames were everywhere, But no one really cared- It always burned up there before....  I saw the rats lie down on Broadway- I watched the mighty skyline fall. The boats were waiting at the Battery, The union went on strike- They never sailed at all.  They sent a carrier out from Norfolk- And picked the Yankees up for free. They said that Queens could stay, They blew the Bronx away- And sank Manhattan out to sea....  You know those lights were bright on Broadway- But that was so many years ago... Before we all lived here in Florida- Before the Mafia took over Mexico. There are not many who remember- They say a handful still survive... To tell the world about... The way the lights went out, And keep the memory alive....

      We have a three day weekend this weekend. That is the most excellent thing I have ever heard. That means one out of the 4 weeks we have left has only FOUR days in it!  It's Spring Fling week, tonight's video night or something, and I think I'll go just so I can watch Steven's 30 minute monster movie, his stuff is always so cool. Then me and Charlotte are goin' to see 13 Going On 30... we'll see how that is, I've gotten mixed reviews. My dad liked it, so there's a chance.  THREE DAY WEEKEND Oh the possiblities of a three day weekend. You can do CRAZY things like, have a sleepover on a SUNDAY or... well that about sums it up. Either way that means that there's a four day work week! Oh how I am easily overjoyed. I got a pretty red shirt yesterday and I feel very ... red. Or is this magenta? But I feel red. Even though.. it's magenta. My throat hurts very badly, I must stop singing so loud in my car. But when it's Queen you just got-ta!

      Guess what???? I'M GOING TO NEW YORK!!! For my senior trip my mom is taking me to the Big Apple! (Mallorie gets to go on a cruise to Alaska). I'm so excited, but it's so far away!  But, right now, I'm excited about THIS summer, which is FOUR WEEKS AWAY. Holy moly. My first summer having my license! Concerts, camping, summer camp, Wild Waves, hot days at the park, Bumbershoot, barbeques, lunch in Pike Place, tubing at Caitlin's, AAAH i can't even stand it I'm so anxious for it all to start!!!  Oo Ryan got 3rd at the art competition and is going to Texas for Nationals, so cool! Cept for the Texas part. Cause Texas is far away, and it's full of hicks. But that's okay, we'll forgive them. Today was the recital, wasn't as bad as I thought. This day went by really really slow. Well, it's Sunday. They always go by slow. Ew school tomorrow. I'm gonna blow it up. Someday.

      Well well.. Saturday afternoon and here I am sitting at my computer. Actually I'm supposed to be tidying this room but I don't feel like it right now. Then I'm going to go look for a job... sigh... I'm not sure whether I really want one or whether I'm completely dreading this step into adulthood. I do know one thing: I need money. I have 2 dollars on my credit card. 2. My car is almost empty shit I forgot about that I can't do anything today!!! Uh ohhh. Crapmuffin. I think my mom said something about taking me dress shopping later tonight but I'm not sure I should in case Ryan can't get us tickets. Well.. there's no harm in looking, right....? Crap I need money. I need money to make money. It's a vicious cycle. Oh yeah btw Ryan the Dave tickets are NOT sold out on Ticketmaster, you silly monkey, don't buy some $90 scalper ticket! Camping is still available too. Or you could just bunk with us! Lol. GAA I wish it was summer right now it's gonna be so great!!! Summer summer summer summer. Wow I hate school.

Me, Caitlin, Rachael, and Amanda are gonna see "Shrek 2" and they're sleepin' over n such and that hasn't happened for way too long so I'm looking forward to that. As for Saturday, I have no idea what I'm gonna do cause .. well seems like everyone's doing something (I hate you Ryan and Charlotte... lol uh yeah everybody!). I tried watching Mary Poppins today but have realized that it is actually too young for me (for some reason other Disney movies aren't) and I fell asleep and woke up at 6 and was like AH CRAP 8 pages!!! But it's coming along well so it's cool. Well, I'm off!

      Mmm that sounds good. I'm not sure what to say, I just wanted to write something down.. mainly because there's no one to talk to online and I've already checked any sites I usually look at... and this is the next stop.... hm. Well, had a good day, half-day, woo! Let's see... had private school kids stare at my posse, movie was great, me and Erinn beat Charlotte and Nick at Taboo (barely), oo and I had one of those new cheesy gordita crunches from Taco Bell. Yah that was exciting. I was all like CHEESY... CRUNCHY... MELTY! And we started watching The Godfather but only got like 15 minutes in before we had to go... and now I really wanna keep watching it but everybody'd get mad, plus I want them to see it. I'm babbling. I'm sorry. I just feel like... sharing!  Josh is acting like nothing happened, which I guess is what I am doing, because I hate strife and I don't want to prolong what I have decided to proclaim the DUMBEST FIGHT EVER, but to tell you the truth what you did hurt because it was out of spite, whereas what we did was a misunderstanding. And the fact that you talked about us to EVERYBODY that you were 'so mad', and, if I know you, probably painted us out to be bitches, even though if you told them the actual story they would probably go away thinking you were being ridiculous.... I don't know if I can be okay with you right now. You know you'll always be my buddy, but just this week, uh maybe not... cause you sure weren't treating us like a friend. I would have this horrible sinking feeling in my stomach every time you would pass me in the halls after I say hi, with that snotty expression on your face, ignoring me. How can you treat one of your closest friends (or at least I thought), someone who is always there for you,  that way after they just didn't think to invite you to some dumb movie??? How is that justified? Uhhh... I just don't think we deserved how you treated us so um yeah. There. It's hard for me to say things like that to people but goddammit I'm posting it! Meh he doesnt' read this site anyways so this way I'm just getting it off my chest. There I feel better! Yeah.

      So yeah... welcome to the worst three days of well.. not my life but..  of... Spring? Uh yeah that'll do. Seems like everybody suddenly decided they hate me and forgot to let me know. I'm not sure what I did to Josh, I'm very confused about how he can be so maliciously upset about some sort of trivial (did I say trivial? can i say it 5 more times?) misunderstanding. It's the weirdest thing. It's really the cherry on top to this SUPER week I'm having. Oh well, be mad if it makes you happy, because that's the only reason I can think of that you would be so insanely absurdly mad at me and Charlotte (and not Erinn wtf). Unless I accidentally killed your grandmother, and for that I am sorry. Lol. Thanks for being a good friend. But.. Oh well.        Anyways. Yeah. This year has been full of disgustingly-highschool drama, which is new for me. I'm not the sort that enjoys drama, in fact it kind of breaks me down completely, because my friends are the most important thing to me (it should be like, school, huh? uhhhh oh well) and I never try to do anything to hurt them but I'm starting to realize that that doesn't matter.         Ryan, you need to get your license. Now. It was very depressing on Saturday night to come home to an empty house. Especially cause.. you know.. I won't see you til uh 2008. Sigh. Why does everything suck so bad? I'm a happy person I swear, just... not right now.

      It is a 1 because I didn't do anything today. It is a 1 because it didn't suck entirely. It was a 1 because my mom was acting crazy. It is a 1 because I made dinner and it tasted good and I was proud. It is a 1 because I had a good talk with Charlotte because she's always there to listen. It is a 1 because the Simpsons, That 70s Show and Malcolm in the Middle are new. It's a 1 because I'm an idiot and need to finish writing out my rough draft. It's a 1 because today was on the verge of sucking and the potential to be good. I think.  I love this song, no matter how short it is.  Parachutes Coldplay  In a haze, a stormy haze I'll be round, I'll be loving you always Always Here I am and I'll take my time Here I am and I'll wait in line always Always.

      I had this weird dream last night that I was part of some sort of government spy team, or maybe we were superheroes, or.. something. We were in a big dark house (that happened to be in the location of my house, but inside it wasn't at all like it, it was more like those big rooms that have all that machinery like in James Bond video games). It was Halloween night, and I can't remember now who it was exactly, but we were fighting something. After we beat them we ran out, making our way out of the neighborhood and there was all these crazy Halloween decorations, like holographic spiders and ghosts. Hm that's strange, I remember now that we were in a car when we first left the house, because I remember that Diddy Kong (yes, the monkey Diddy Kong was part of the team) didn't get in on time and had to jump through the door while it was moving. Lol! That was a cuhrazy dream. I wish I had finished it.   I'm not sure why I had that dream, usually I can pick out where each aspect of my dream came from (ie. if I had been playing Donkey Kong or even thinking about it that day then it would make sense that Diddy Kong would be there, but i hadn't). Totally random. Well, I guess I'm glad that I had an imaginative dream, cause lately they've been really boring.   I think I'm gonna start rating my days, too. We'll start with yesterday. I think my range will be from 5 to -5, counting 0. Yesterday was a 0. I'm tempted to give it a much lower number, but it all evened itself out I guess. No.. it was a -1. Yeah.

      I came home to find that my family went out to dinner and to go see Van Helsing. Amanda's not answering her phone, Charlotte is with Carrie, Josh is mad at me for heavens knows why, and the worst thing is that Ryan's mom doesn't want him to hang out with me. So I'm going to lie down on my couch and feel like complete shit. Have a good night.

Today, I got to get out of 2 and 3 period to go to my dental surgery analysis... crap that's gonna suck... all wisdom teeth removed, 2nd molar removed. That's really gonna suck. But yeah then me and mah Daddah went to Taco Del Mar and it was yummy. Then school just FLEW by.... I missed the period that I had to turn in the huge rough draft of my research paper that I was up late for last night.. oh well it wasn't very good and now I have the weekend to do it. Anywaaaays... in journalism we had pizza (finally... a week after the paper comes out), and I had a big burrito for lunch, then me, Charlotte, Erinn, and Michelle hung out then we had really yummy ice cream at GyroWorld in Factoria... then we came here and ate pizza.... I've had a lot of food today. Blech. We played with my little guinea pig and he made little birdy noises. Tomorrow I'm chillin' with Ryan in Seattle maybe, and Sunday I will work on my research paper (kind of). It's making out to be a pretty good weekend! Each week seems to be faster and faster as we get towards summer, this will be the best summer ever! I can't wait.....!!! I think we get our yearbooks next week. 3 weeks til the seniors graduate. And almost one month til we're OUTTA here. Elvis has left the building!  PS. Holy crap! i was just looking at the calender and we have only 25 more days of school left (not counting weekends)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I ...want to make you feel beautiful  I know I tend to get so insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  And She will be loved  And She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls  Tap on my window knock on my door I ...want to make you feel beautiful  She will be loved She will be loved She will be loved  Please don't try so hard to say good bye.  ********  "She Will be Loved" -Maroon 5   -------------------------------------------  I stayed home from school today..  Not really because I felt very sick, I mean my throat and my nose ('dose') is stuffy but I wouldn't have died. I just couldn't face the day, I was so tired, and I really, really hate school. I wish I could fake sick until June 21 but sadly I don't think that'd be possible. I found out today that my senior year of school starts the week BEFORE labor day weekend. That really sucks. I have the Prince concert the night of the first day of school. Then that weekend, it's Bumbershoot which we'll DEFinitely not be able to go to anymore, and of course, the DAVE MATTHEWS concert that we'll have to leave early early for on Saturday and get back on Monday is THAT weekend. I wanted to go to Bumbershoot too (Char! Our tradition must NOT be broken! Even though it's totally impossible and impractical! DAMMIT). And... I don't want to write my research paper that's 8 pages and due on Friday. Sigh.  I made a mix-cd today... I'm proud of myself. The list (for lack of anything else to say):  1. Amber   -   311 2. Kiss Me   -   Sixpence 3. Crash Into Me   -   Dave Matthews Band 4. In My Place   -   Coldplay 5. Yellow   -   Coldplay 6. Shiver   -   Coldplay 7. Clocks   -   Coldplay 8.

      Let's see. I fell while running with socks, and got these huge black bruises on my knees. I got gum on my leg. I lost my iPod. I stole a strawberry (heh oo BADASS). I got us lost. More than once. More than 10 times I think. I almost killed us in the car. I am broke. I made you drink milk and eat vegetables (what? uh, ew?). My car is a station wagon. You're a candy necklace, I'm a chocolate kiss (OBviously doesn't work). I just hit my head on the table. Ryan, why do you hang with me again? Then again you fell off my bed so..  *     *     *  One of my very favorites, it's so rock n roll, baby.   HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN the Beatles  She's not a girl who misses much Do do do do do do- oh yea She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand Like a lizard on a window pane  The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors On his hobnail boots Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy Working overtime A soap impression of his wife which he ate And donated to the National Trust  I need a fix 'cause I'm going down Down to the bits that I left uptown I need a fix cause I'm going down Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun Mother Superior jump the gun  Happiness is a warm gun Happiness is a warm gun, momma When I hold you in my arms And I feel my finger on your trigger I know nobody can do me no harm Because happiness is a warm gun, momma Happiness is a warm gun -Yes it is. Happiness is a warm, yes it is... Gun! Well don't ya know that happiness is a warm gun, momma?

      Another rainy day. I'm done taking those stupid quizzes, I just spent like half an hour of my precious time. I'm so sad without my iPod... it was all the music I love ready at the touch of a button. And I had it everywhere I went, it was like the best present I ever got. My dad is still playing the guilt trip on me, saying things like, "I spent so long thinking of the quote to put on the back", and "You must not have locked your car, you forget everything else". Sigh.  Hm I'm listening to one of Billy Joel's piano albums, I never listened to it all the way through. He's so talented, holy shit.  I kind of miss playing the piano, I was pretty good when I stopped but I didnt' have the time to practice once I got to highschool and was doing soccer and stuff. Well and I really don't need to be playing two instruments right now. I'm glad I did it though, they say that if you are a musician you should always have a background in piano because it develops your ear and your sense for music, which I've obviously retained.. that could just be genes though. My dad keeps saying he's going to get me vocal lessons and guitar lessons and bass guitar lessons. I could teach myself if I had the time. Or patience. I want a cookie.

      This is cuhrazy... I took this weird "color test", (yes another dumb-ass quiz... Maybe i should do my homework.. hm no) and just from picking colors in a certain order it tells you all this stuff about you... and it's strangely close. This is what they told me:  *         *         *         *         *  Your Existing Situation Works well in cooperation with others but is disinclined to take the leading role. Needs a personal life of mutual understanding and freedom from discord.  Your Stress Sources The existing situation is disagreeable. Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the rank and file. Her control of her sensual instincts restricts her ability to give herself, but the resulting isolation leads to the urge to surrender and allow herself to merge with another. This disturbs her. as such instincts are regarded as weaknesses to be overcome; she feels that only by continued self-restraint can she hope to maintain her attitude of individual superiority. Wants to be loved or admired for herself alone; needs attention, recognition, and the esteem of others.  Your Restrained Characteristics Circumstances are forcing her to compromise, to restrain her demands and hopes, and to forgo for the time being some of the things she wants.  Your Desired Objective Wants interesting and exciting things to happen. Able to make herself well-liked by her obvious interest and by the very openness of her charm. Over-imaginative and given to fantasy or day-dreaming.  Your Actual Problem Greatly impressed by the unique, by originality, and by individuals of outstanding characteristics. Tries to emulate the characteristics she admires and to display originality in her own personality.  Your Actual Problem #2 Has a fear that she might be prevented from achieving the things she wants. This leads her to employ great personal charm in her dealings with others, hoping that this will make it easier for her to reach her objectives.   ____________________________  I don't know how well I know myself but to me that's pretty right. Especially the part about being over-imaginative, and day-dreamy. Some call it spaciness.. but day-dreamy.. yeah that's a much better word.

        urlLink take the emo quiz .created by  urlLink jessi    I'm so not emo. I am a happy well-adjusted human being. I am so happy with myself. Well actually not really, right now I believe that I am probably the stupidest most horrible excuse for a person to ever walk the planet. ... I lost my iPod.. or it was stolen... I'm not sure. Either way it was my fault, if I didn't lock my car. I don't know if I did. I always do. ...Yeah, just say it. I'm fucked. I'm not sure which is worse... that i don't have my iPod anymore or how mad my dad will be when I tell him... which will probably be after dinner... Sigh. The most ironic part is that when my dad gave it to me, he said "I put your name and number on the back because I know you'll lose it." If I get a job, (which I need to anyway), I could get another one... Sigh they're $300 dollars and it was my only 17th birthday present and it was so cool ...and I hate myself so much right now I can hardly stand it.  It has been quite a shitty day actually. Which is weird because I got a new guinea pig and it's disgustingly adorable and blond.  Woah. You know what I realized just now? Woah. On Friday Shanice did a Tarot reading for me, I don't believe in them but they're fun anyways... but... it kinda came true. The question I asked didn't come true AND she also said that something bad would happen that would be hard to deal with... EEeRY no? But she also said that it would eventually be a good change. Maybe this will inspire me to get a job. Hm. Interesting. A Pet-Pros is opening soon by the Baskin Robbins by my house... I should work there, I've always wanted to work at a pet store, it just makes sense. I should go get an application right now. Sigh... the wrath of my dad awaits.. he'll tell me I'm stupid and flaky and forget everything and that I don't deserve any of the things I get and that I'm a horrible person. It's all true but I don't need to hear it from anyone but myself. I was having such a good day yesterday too. Who knew running in the rain and being pushed around by crowds of rude people and getting hopelessly lost everywhere you go would be so fun. Later on in the night there were times where I would forget, that I'm in such deep shit, and everything was wonderful and happy. ...Then EARTH TO ME it's not.  Sigh...God I'm dumb.

      I went a little lyric crazy... um Golden stars to anyone who read through any of those. I've been sitting in front of my computer for 2 hours listening to Billy Joel, my dad was playing it on the piano and I had to go listen to the real thing. It's pouring rain. I like it. I like rain. When I'm in the mood for it... and I am. I'm home all alone and it's cozy in my house and it's raining. Unfortunately it's also Friday, and I don't have any plans at all. Oh well. The weekend awaits.

      Now we take our time  So nonchalant  And spend our nights  So Bon vivant  We dress our days  In silken robes  The money comes  The money goes  We know it's all a passing phase,....   We light our lamps  For atmosphere  And hang our hopes  On chandeliers  We're going long  We're gaining weight  We're sleeping long  And far too late  And so it's times  To change our ways  But I've loved these days.   Now as we indulge  In things refined  We hide our hearts  From harder times  A string of pearls  A foreign car  Oh we can only go so far  On caviar and Cabernay.   We drown our doubts  In dry champage  and soothe our souls  with fine cocaine  I don't know why i ever care  We'll get so high  And get nowhere  We'll have to change our jaded ways,...  But i've loved these days.   So before we end  And then begin  we'll drink a toast to how it's been  a few more hours to be complete  a few more nights on satin sheets  A few more times that I can say,..  I've loved these days   -Billy Joel

      They say that these are not the best of times, But they're the only times I've ever known, And I believe there is a time for meditation in cathedrals of our own. Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes, And I can only stand apart and sympathize.  For we are always what our situations hand us... It's either sadness or euphoria. And so we argue and we compromise, and realize that nothing's ever changed, For all our mutual experience, our separate conclusions are the same.  Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity, Our reason co-exists with our insanity. And though we choose between reality and madness... It's either sadness or euphoria.  How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies Perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies. And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives, With our respective similarities... It's either sadness or euphoria  -Billy Joel

      She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence  She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain  And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments  She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain   It's all about soul  It's all about faith and a deeper devotion  It's all about soul  'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion  She's got to be strong  'Cause so many things getting out of control  Should drive her away  So why does she stay?  It's all about soul   She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming  And I realize I must have gone a million miles away  And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment  And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say   It's all about soul  It's all about knowing what someone is feeling  The woman's got soul  The power of love and the power of healing  This life isn't fair  It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold  You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough  It's all about soul   There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness  There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive  She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires  And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive   It's all about soul  It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow  It's all about soul  Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow  You've got to be hard  Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll  But that's only part, you know in your heart  It's all about soul    -Billy Joel

      Swing in this tree Oh I am bounce around so well Branch to branch, limb to limb you see All in a day's dream I'm stuck Like the other monkeys here I am a humble monkey Sitting up in here again But then came the day I climbed out of these safe limbs Ventured away Walking tall, head high up and singing I went to the city Car horns, corners and the gritty Now I am the proudest monkey you've ever seen Monkey see, monkey do   Then comes the day Staring at myself I turn to question me I wonder do I want the simple, simple life that I once lived in well Oh things were quiet then In a way they were the better days But now I am the proudest monkey you've ever seen Monkey see, monkey do Monkey see, monkey do   -Dave Matthews   ......it's Friday!

      I just watched the last episode of Friends... why is it so sad that it's over? Even though the last two seasons haven't been the best, it's still like everybody's favorite show and wow for some reason it's really sad it's over. And Frasier is ending too. Two of the shows that seem like there's never been a time in my life when they haven't been there. On the previews they always have to have the inspiring piano music, and it's in black and white, and it's all dramatic and you're like SHIT why do i care SO MUCH. My world is coming apart at the seams. Sigh.

      The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.  And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lahaha lovely, Lalalalovely  Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points As I'm all by myself tonight not again not againÉ  And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lahaha lovely lalalalovely   Well if you should nervously break down When its time for the shakedown would you take it It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made it And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice.  Lalalalovely la hahalovely Say say it again  Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again Again. Loving again.... It's coming again.... Lalalalovely...

      Gr my AIM hasnt' been working since Sunday, and I don't know why... that's very upsetting.  Art club today, I'm sick of working on my self-portrait, i need to quit messing with it. Mr Grossman says he's gonna send in some work to uh I forget where but i need to start something more interesting. Anyways. Me and Josh went shopping today, I'm very sick of shopping now. But this time I actually had money so that was cool. I don't know if everyone's seen My Best Friend's Wedding but... this is my favorite part, when they're on the boat and he says 'remember our song?' and he sings this softly and wow I'm sorry I'm really being dumb and girly right now but GOD DAMMIT i'm a girl and I like chick flicks. This is one of the most romantic songs ever.. god sorry I'm in a sappy mood. *melts*   Just the Way You Look Tonight- Frank Sinatra  Someday, when I'm awfully low, When the world is cold I will feel a glow just thinking of you And the way you look tonight.  Lovely ... Never, ever change. Keep that breathless charm. Won't you please arrange it  'Cause I love you ... Just the way you look tonight.  With each word your tenderness grows, Tearing my fears apart... And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart.  And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, Touches my foolish heart.  Someday, when I'm awfully low, When the world is cold I will feel a glow just thinking of you And the way you look tonight. _______________  I also enjoy video games, teenage mutant ninja turtles, batman, and adventure movies where the mighty power of God melts the bad guys' faces off. RADICAL! MOST OUTSTANDING!

      Well well... another day well spent doing nothing... Well, I dyed my hair to it's natural color.. sick of it being a strange color of red... so now...it's brown... I had almost forgotten... I also forgot how white my skin is and now my hair is so dark that I look like some sort of porcelain doll. But so that's what I did today. And I lost my favorite belt (well my only belt, my studded one) somewhere, I thought it was in the dressing room of Nordstroms but I went there today and it wasn't. That's depressing. It rained today. That's depressing too. And it's only Tuesday. That's extremely depressing. But tomorrow is Wednesday, which means Art Club and Charlotte-and-Natalie movie night (Harrison Ford month continues with... "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"! Now Showing in Natalie's Room).  And then it's Thursday!

      This is an awesome Billy Joel song, that was on a CD that I lost, but Ryan dug it up online and now I have it! :) :) :)  I love Billy Joel, he's such a great songwriter and singer and piano player and holy crap. I love big cities and to me his stuff always makes me think of New York, well maybe because he's a New Yorker and many of his songs are, well, about New York.   SCENES FROM AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT Billy Joel  A bottle of white, a bottle of red Perhaps a bottle of rose instead We'll get a table near the street In our old familiar place You and I - face to face A bottle of red, a bottle of white It all depends on your appetite I'll meet you any time you want In our Italian Restaurant.  Things are okay with me these days Got a good job, got a good office Got a new wife, got a new life And the family's fine We lost touch long ago You lost weight I did not know You could ever look so nice after so much time.  Do you remember those days hanging out at the village green? Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans Drop a dime in the box play the song about New Orleans Cold beer, hot lights, my sweet romantic teenage nights  Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies And the king and the queen of the prom Riding around with the car top down and the radio on Nobody looked any finer Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner We never knew we could want more than that out of life Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive.  Brenda and Eddy were still going steady in the summer of '75 when they decided the marriage would be at the end of July Everyone said they were crazy "Brenda you know you're much too lazy Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life." But there we were wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye.  They got an apartment with deep pile carpet And a couple of paintings from Sears A big waterbed that they bought with the bread They had saved for a couple of years They started to fight when the money got tight And they just didn't count on the tears.  They lived for a while in a very nice style But it's always the same in the end They got a divorce as a matter of course And they parted the closest of friends Then the king and the queen went back to the green But you can never go back there again.  Brenda and Eddie had had it already by the summer of '75 From the high to the low to the end of the show For the rest of their lives They couldn't go back to the greasers The best they could do was pick up the pieces We always knew they would both find a way to get by That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie Can't tell you more 'cause I've told you already And here we are wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye.  A bottle of red, a bottle of white Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight I'll meet you anytime you want In our Italian Restaurant.

      So um yeah, kill me.  SCHOOL MUST DIE. School must die Die. Die die die. Can you tell that i just like to write words down? It's fun to type and just never punctuate ever...........  ...Maybe it's cause it's May now, maybe it's cause it's been warm and summery lately, maybe it's cause I hate my classes, maybe it's because it's not Thursday, but.. i'm really hating school... I can't fucking last through the end of the year... SUMMER IS SO CLOSE YET SO FAR. Ga. This summer is going to be SO GREAT.  Camping in my backyard, chillin' at all the parks like everyday, swimming in nasty-butt lake washington, going to seattle, barbeques, driving around, sitting in front of the Thriftway, walking to Baskin Robbins, Mariners games, Camp Burton, summer concerts... Not having school... being the new Seniors.... It'll be the BEST SUMMER EVER. I need to take everyday at a time.  Monday... monday's half over. Yeah. Tomorrow's Tuesday.. I can handle that. Wednesday... sure. Thursday of course. Friday my brain will explode in my restless little body waiting for 2 o'clock. Then the week will be over! Yeah! And there's only like 6 of those left! SHIT

      Another uneventful day... Amanda went home pretty early, I did yardwork for my mom planting stuff... then I went by myself to Southcenter, fuuuun right... well it wasn't but I was only there for like 45 minutes then I got bored and left ...and here I am now! My little sister got the new Hanson cd... I put it on my iPod and.... god dammit it's a good cd! Haha... uhh I didn't just say that... I think I love it. Uh...... lyrics time! This is a hilarious song by Prince from his new album Musicology... my favorite part is "He called her Flo... as is 'rescent' "  Prince: Illusion, Coma, Pimp & Circumstance   She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance  So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance  Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance?  This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance   She was older but rich beyond compare  She'd drop a thousand dollars at the saloon just 2 get her hair did  He was good at compliments, better in the bunk  She laced him with a crib in Paris, he hipped her 2 the funk   Way 2 fine he was 4 her  A dirty dog in expensive fur  As long as she's providing chips and whips  We can do this funky thang  As long as she was playing the host  He figured he would make the most of them hips and lips  He hooked her up, rocked her coast 2 coast   Ugly...  So ugly, rich beyond compare  She's dropped a couple hundred thousand dollars on a silver whip  Just 2 match the color of her hair  She said "Eye got plenty of what U need.  Put the spoon down honey, c'mon, let mama feed U"   She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance  So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance  Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance?  This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance   Where was Eye? Oh yeah...  A gentleman he was  He never spoke about her nose  So prominent because in the dark it'd glow  If she was only tan instead of so lily white  Her name was Doris but he called her "Flo"  As in "-Rescent" -  That ain't right  Fluorescent every night  A situation bound 2 fail  As sure a Doris' skin was pale   Money might talk, but what does it say?  U better get busy if U wanna get paid  "Boy, Eye was fine back in the day"   She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance  So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance  Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance?  That's the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance  Now, dance   Dance   He spent her money oh so well  Take a bath in cold Kristal  He took a trip 2 burn an old flame in 'Frisco, like wow  But Doris caught him in her arms  She shrugged her shoulders and said "No harm"  Just put Ur name on this pre-nup and we can all hit the disco   She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance  So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance  Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance?  This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance   She knew which fork 2 use but she couldn't dance  So he hipped her 2 the funk in xchange 4 the finance  Who's pimpin' who if nobody gets a second chance?  This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp & circumstance  Now, dance   Dance

      It was soo hot today. I went to the mall with Mom and Jeana waiting for Mallorie to get her hair done for Prom, oh yeah Prom's tonight. Actually, it's going on right now. It feels like I was supposed to go because my whole day revolved around it; I went to Charlotte's and did her make up and I made her look pur-ritty.. I wish I got to see them off cause I didnt' get to see Nick's outfit all put together, but yeah it's really funny I was like, their stylist... I picked out both of thier outfits and put Charlotte's together.... hehe. Now Amanda's sleepin' over and we went to Wendy's and I'm glad I'm actually doing something today. Maybe not what I was planning originally (...) but I'm doing something.

      Hello.. I'm bored... Mallorie and my mom took my car to go to the Gypsy Kings concert (wow... yeah... cool...) so I couldn't do anything tonight.. so I listened to music in my room for like 2 hours then watched TV for 2 hours.... and now I'm on the computer.. ga it feels like a SCHOOL NIGHT. Oh I had my first 6 hour art class today... 3 more to go... and GUESS who's the model... the same guy from last time. The same flamboyant skinny weird little man that I never wanted to see naked again. But somehow it happened. And he played the same wierd African-wannabe muzak. Well I guess only Ryan would know what I'm talking about but still. Oh and I'm by far the youngest person in the class, by about 10 years. Yeah. It said 17+, and I'm 17 so whatever! Mwahah and I'm better than most of them. I love that. Wow I'm a horrible person! Lol... um.. I'm gonna go now...

      Woo, summer, woo!!! Haha that was more enthusiastic than I meant it to be. So yeah it's summer, actually the first official week of summer has passed. I've kept myself very busy and now I'm outta gas. Man, I need friends who drive besides me! Lol. But it's cool... yeah.  Today was a most excellent day at the beach: me, Charlotte, Nick, Josh, and Jesse at Newcastle Beach wooo! Yesterday was also very cool, I got a new outfit at Nordstroms while I was there turning in an application (!!), and I had a job interview for (buh buhbuh BUH!) SAM GOODY! It went really well and I hope SOOOOOO much that I get that job, all you guys know it's like my DREAM JOB (ok highschool job lol) to work in a record store! Babababa I hope I get it I hope I hope.  Also, on Friday Charlotte slept over and we continued our fabulous scrapbook with all the pictures from my BBQ and pictures from a camera I dug up and developed from last summer. It's so outstanding, yaaay we rock. Oh lol today we got MORE pictures back and now (OH NO) the scrapbook won't be in chronological order cause they're from last summer! Oh wells. They're really cute! Glad I had fun today because for the next four days I have a 6 hour figure drawing class, that's alot o naked. I'll probably be the youngest one there because I signed up for the adult class.... Hopefully I won't be the worst too. Lol. I'm just sick of being put in with the 13-14 year olds who are just like "Drawing is fun! Haha naked, that sounds funny!", like last time. Wish me luck not getting lost in Seattle tomorrow...!  Gaaa Ryan come home dammit! It's Independence Day soon. I'm tired. I need to finish ma art.  I'm hungry! How did that happen?

      I'm not sure what to make of this day... it seems like a very long time since I woke up. I saw Ryan for the last time for the next two weeks... that's depressing... then around 8:30 I picked up Josh, and consequently his little "friend" Jesse, and I spontaneously drove us to Seattle where we went on the rollercoaster and walked around and yeah... I'm so very bored and for some reason kinda down... I feel like either throwing a pillow at something or just going to sleep. Either way I want to be alone, as if I had a choice. I don't know why this suddenly came over me but I feel... down. I get in these moods when I just feel stupid and tired and unattractive and unloved. And... sleepy. I'm going to sleep. My melodramatic-ness disgusts even myself.

      That was a lot of 'o's!  I can't believe I have to go to school tomorrow because it feels like summer has begun already... Friday's BBQ went off great, I think we have to have one like once a month fo sho. I could do that every night. Well, maybe not the sleeping on the ground part, but definitely the chilling in the backyard at night part! But we need to learn how to make a good fire. Died down so quick! But anyway that really rocked and I love you guys (awww)! Great way to start off the summer, as Ryan said...  Yesterday we saw Donnie Darko, it was really good, but the bunny was so scary.... But you know when you're just in the mood for a dark movie... yeah it was really good. I'm still trying to work it all out in my head; I'm not sure if it's supposed to make sense, even. I'm just wondering what was put IN the movie for the director's cut... leaving out anything would not make any sense! You guys should go see it and tell me what you think. Oh man that rabbit was scary though. That was a really fun day... I'm in big trouble for being out too late (uhhh two hours too late) but who cares it was worth it. *ROUND 27* it's OOONNNN, Ryan!!! You're goin' DOWN! You just had the home-base advantage.  >:|  ..... Lol. I'll never beat you... (*'cause you're a man, a manny man man* ....lololol i'm funny) but I'll never stop trying!!! ...Natalie never quits! ....Except for that one time... Today we went with Caitlin's family to see the Billy Joel musical, Movin' Out, the dancers were soo talented, but it was very confusing because there was no dialogue and it was just interpretive dancing. But it was Billy Joel music and that just makes everything awesome! Yay! And now... I have to go to sleep because I have to wake up at 6:30. For school. For three hours of school. What the hell. Oh well. I feel fufilled by a very satisfying weekend.

On Friday, anyone who doesn't have a final 6th period (talkin' to you, band people) I'm going home after 5th period finals are over (uh that's like 11:30...!) cause I don't have a 6th period, so come early if you want, cause I'll be bored...! I hope it's sunny.... really really hope it's sunny.... oh and bring your bathin' suit just in case we do wanna do stuff at Caitlin's house. Wait who am I talking to...? All 4 or 5 people who read my site? Fantastic. I'm so cool. I'm gonna go shoot myself now.  SO BORED.....!

      Hello all... I've had a busy weekend and I still have homework. How crappy is that. On Friday, me, Josh and my aunt Robin went to the mall, i wish I had any money at all, then I went to hang out with Ryan at a partay, fun stuff but I WISH i was told to bring my BATHING SUIT >:| jk it's k, then yesterday it was Erinn's b-day party, which of course was horribly divided into little cliques yeah. I was about to go home around 1am but ga for some reason I stayed, but I left as soon as I woke up this morning around 9. I have homework to do that I don't wanna do, but I really should, and I should study because well it's finals week and that sucks. But you know what ELSE it is??? THE LAST WEEK OF SCHOOL yah baby!  God I'm so bored I hate Sundays cause Sundays are always like, well, I can't stay up late and I have school tomorrow and it's a whole week and I procrastinated on my homework and it's not sunny and it's not rainy and it's too bright and it's dark in my house and i just wanna go to sleep until Friday.  I hope Friday will be fun... I hope it's sunny so it'd be nice to go out on Caitlin's boat. She says we can go tubing but we'll see how that goes... I did get a new bathing suit though, but yeah,  the lake is freakin' freezing Mr. Bigglesworth. K i'm just babbling on and on so I'm gone.

      Hey ya'll... it's flippin' Monday. That's just not cool. But nevertheless I had a pretty good day... I finished Josh's yearbook page I made for him, we've had so many good times, man! Listing them all was so hard, but gosh darnit, I did it! That was great. Front and back. WHO ROCKS??? You better come up with good stuff for mine or I'll beat you up! So yeah.  The seniors' last full day is tomorrow, then they have a half day, then on Thursday they graduate. It's gonna be so weird without them! Lol now WE can chill in the Senior Lounge. Heh. Alex Davis told me his 'secret' today, I'm almost sad that I already knew but it was cool that he opened up to me. I think him and Carrie should come to my BBQ too, the more the merrier, right? They're cool kids.  It is weird though that all the seniors are leaving. Journalism is gonna be emPTY. My senior homies! Uhoh I'm gonna be counselor, therapist, shoulder to cry on, and comic relief for Charlotte in the next couple weeks. Hehe. NO SWEAT BUDDY. Cause.... I'LL BE THEEEERRRRRRRREEEE... IIII'LLL BE THEERRRRRRRRREE, WHENEVER YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE THEEERRRRRE. Heh... ew I have to go to Mallorie's symphony concert that will probably go til like 10. GA. SO MUCH TO DO SO MUCH TO SAY SO MUCH TO SAY

      I'm sleepy. I have homework to do. My tummy hurts. But... I'm GREAT! Lol. I just had an awesome weekend... today me and my little sis saw Harry Potter, and of course, it was good.. and then we went to Mongolian Grill and I ate so much because it was like the first thing I ate all day because I woke up around 1... I was up until almost 4 last night, cause of prom. Which was SO FUN and one of the best nights I can think of. The place was great, the food was great, the company was great ( ;)  ). Best night ever.  Oh also yesterday, I think I did pretty good at the SATs (math's gonna kill me though).  TEN AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL

      I call you up You pick up You call my bluff On the card of love You hold too close Your hands to your chest I can’t read your eyes But I confess It’s lonely far from you, oh  Even when you’re right by me It’s only why I wait for you To take my hand  Why do I beg like a child for your candy?  Why do I come after you like I do? I love you  Wherever you are I swear You’ll be my angel You  I play my cards the best I can But I lose my luck when you’re not here My darling heart Won’t you please give in?  I may be strong But I want you back again  When you’re not here it’s hard to pretend It’s all alright again When you’re not here love it’s hard to pretend It’s all alright but still Why do I beg like a child for your candy?  Why do I run after you like I do? I love you  Whatever you are I swear You be my angel, you  Watch the deck Count your cards Makes no sense That I’m always losing When you’re gone  Why do I beg like a child for your candy?  Why do I come after you like I do? I love you Whatever you are I swear You’ll be my angel, you When you’re gone

      Does anyone wanna go see Maroon 5 with me at the Puyallup fair? Yeah, I know none of us are HUGE fans but it's only 15 dollars and it's at the flippin fair! It'd be good times.  There are DMB tickets still available. I don't know why I'm reporting this but I thought I'd let you know.

      I get high when I see you go by My oh my. When you sigh, my, my inside just flies, Butterflies Why am I so shy when I'm beside you? It's only love and that is all, Why should I feel the way I do? It's only love, and that is all, But it's so hard loving you.  Is it right that you and I should fight Ev'ry night? Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, Very bright. Haven't I the right to make it up girl? It's only love and that is all, Why should I feel the way I do? It's only love, and that is all But it's so hard loving you Yes it's so hard loving you -- loving you.

      Here I stand head in hand Turn my face to the wall If she's gone I can't go on Feelin' two-foot small  Everywhere people stare Each and every day I can see them laugh at me And I hear them say  Hey you've got to hide your love away Hey you've got to hide your love away  How could I even try I can never win Hearing them, seeing them In the state I'm in  How could she say to me Love will find a way Gather round all you clowns Let me hear you say  Hey you've got to hide your love away Hey you've got to hide your love away

      Seven Days Sting  "Seven days" was all she wrote A kind of ultimatum note She gave to me  She gave to me When I thought the field had cleared It seems another suit appeared To challenge me  Woe is me  Though I hate to make a choice My options are decreasing mostly rapidly Well we'll see I don't think she'd bluff this time I really have to make her mine It's plain to see It's him or me  Monday  I could wait till Tuesday If I make up my mind Wednesday would be fine Thursday's on my mind Friday'd give me time Saturday could wait But Sunday'd be too late  The fact he's over six feet ten Might instill fear in other men But not in me,  The Mighty Flee Ask if I am mouse or man The mirror squeaked, away I ran He'll murder me  in time for his tea  Does it bother me at all My rival is Neanderthal It makes me think Perhaps I need a drink IQ is no problem here We won't be playing scrabble for her hand I fear I need that beer  Monday I could wait till Tuesday If I make up my mind Wednesday would be fine Thursday's on my mind Friday'd give me time Saturday could wait But Sunday'd be too late  Seven days will quickly go The fact remains, I love her so Seven days, so many ways But I can't run away  Monday I could wait till Tuesday If I make up my mind Wednesday would be fine Thursday's on my mind Friday'd give me time Saturday could wait But Sunday'd be too late  Do I have to tell a story Of a thousand rainy days since we first met It's a big enough umbrella But it's always me that ends up getting wet

      Okay camp.... Let's see...  I had a most excellent time, the best year yet, woo hoo for getting a taste of being top dog seniors..  I was in Cabin 7, (out of 7 girl cabins), but we were SUPPOSED to get the FANCY COOL 'Moore Cottage' because they switch off every year between the oldest girls and the oldest boys, and the boys got it LAST year, so therefore it was OUR turn for the cabin with a PORCH, a COUCH, a HUGE BATHROOM, an ARMCHAIR and ... A MINIFRIDGE (yeah wtf). Whereas the other cabins are just rectangles with beds in them... Cabin rivalries begin.... So... me and the Cabin 7 girls decided to steal the minifridge.... which... of course is against the rules because girls can't go in boys cabins... but one day... the boys were out of the cabin going to lunch and me, and my friends Rhiannon and Liz, were walking by and we just spontaneously decided to jump through the window and get the fridge... heh... funny stuff. The Moore cottage boys found out by the end of the day and found it ERGH... the next night cabin 6's and cabin 8's mattresses were gone... and were found behind our cabin.. we were FRAMED... haha it was funny.. boys are dumb.  Our counselors were really afraid of retaliation from the boys (they locked up their suitcases) so they struck a deal with the Moore counselors that we would just wear red letter 'T's' like in the Scarlet Letter.. I was friends with a couple Moore boys so I talked my way out of it but it was very funny nontheless. This was my last year and I'm so insanely sad about not coming back... it's so so so much fun and I've been going there every summer for 6 years. But I did turn in an application to be a counselor next year, which would be 4 weeks worth of camp wow. Mostly I'm going to miss the people... living with 10 other people in a cabin for a week and being at camp all week non-stop with everybody gets you really close, fast.... I feel like I just lost some best friends... like Rhiannon, and Jen, and James...  But... we'll keep in touch...

      I've never understood this song more than I do right now, it's such a powerful bittersweet wonderful song... I can play it on the guitar. Yeah....I play the guitar now. And I love it. And it's very exciting and wonderful. Funny what huge changes can happen in just a week. ........  Green Day / Good Riddance(Time of Your Life)  Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.  Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.  So make the best of this test, and don't ask why.  It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time.   It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.  I hope you had the time of your life.   So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind.  Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time.  Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial.  For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.   It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  And then he put his arm around me.  I'm posting this because you can't read it anyways. I'm posting it because if you do it would make it somehow easier if it was put out there. And I'm posting it because if I don't post it I will just spend 3 hours writing this in my journal by hand and it will be very tedious and time-consuming.  So yeah... um.... I'm back from camp.  And everything that implies. And I will write about that chaos later. Maybe

      I'm going to update. Why? Because no one else is and I haven't been on the internet for like two weeks.... Kinda makes me wonder why I'm updating because no one will read it! But anyways.... Yeah so welcome to the most miserable week of my life... I had all my wisdom teeth removed and one of my molars, and now my face is all puffy and my mouth is so swollen I haven't been able to eat normal food for 4 days.... Well there are other reasons I'm upset but I don't need to bore you with the details of that because those who know already know. And I've been holed up in my room watching movies on my bed and I am going crazy. I feel like such crap. And I don't want to leave the house or do anything but I don't want to be HERE. And I go to camp on Sunday. Which I love. But when I'm feeling this shitty it's hard to imagine I'll be having fun in a matter of days.
