      OK, so today was  not  the day for getting back on track with my fitness goals. I slept till 11, ate too many Wow! chips, had a freakin'  double cheeseburger  from Burger King for lunch, and then had a personal sized pizza for dinner. Granted, it was a  Smart Ones  pizza, but c'mon. On top of a double cheeseburger and fries it doesn't really matter. Oh well. Tomorrow is another day.   Check out this website.  www.PicturePerfectPuzzlesPA.com This is my dad's business and I'm working for him. I thank God every day that I'm working for my dad and NOT for Comfort Inn. The Comfort Inn can blow me, bite me, kiss my ass, blow it out its own ass.    Brion said...  ..."I'll call you  as soon as  I get over to my parents house."  That was at 6:54. It is now 8:02. WTF? They only live 3 minutes away.   Prince!  I Would Die 4 U !

      ...and he's changed his name to Martha!  ah... *sigh* Those were the days, huh? The only things I miss about high school are the things that didn't have anything to do with the schooling itself. Could it be nearly ten years already?  Shite!     Anyway...  Yes. Ahem. Anyway, this is my second Blog. My first fell into oblivion last fall. See, the unfortunate focus of that Blog was the January 2003 suicide of my 19 year-old brother, Daniel. It was something I just had to get through at the time. Obviously that's not something you ever  really  get over, but I'm definitely feeling a lot stronger. Strong enough that this Blog is titled, "Spread Sunshine!" as opposed to "01.27.03: The Brotherless Life Begins." Just saying "Spread Sunshine!" makes me feel better, even if I don't always mean it.  :-)    Briefly, more about me.  I'm 27. (Ouch.) I'm a Sagittarius with Capricorn rising, which means I am a  very  moody Sag. I love Led Zeppelin. I don't have any tattoos. If I could eat fast food every day for the rest of my life and not gain an ounce, I would. I love my cat and I hope she never dies. Christmas is my favorite holiday, but I hate winter. I have a thing for shoes and handbags. I am a compulsive shopper. Steeler games make me very, very happy. I will never work in a hotel again as long as I live, I swear it. Oh yeah... and I'm a girl.    Moving right along...  Life is pretty decent right now. I'm having some trouble sticking to my fitness goals and I haven't kept any of my New Year's Resolutions for 2004, but... hey, wait. Yeah, I did! Anyway... I can't really complain. I think my drinking is under control. (Yeah... that was getting to be a crisis after Dan died.) I'm finally done with that shitty ass Comfort Inn, thank you, Jesus. Now I'd like to focus on: (1) Getting back on track with my diet and fitness goals, which will ultimately lead to my losing  those last ten pounds! ; (2) Learning how to cook... one of my New Year's resolutions that I kept for about a week and a half back in January; (3) Reading more books; (4)  Writing  again, I miss it so; (5) Being  true  to myself and being the best person I can be.  Sorry to be a cornball, but that's how I feel! Onward, ho!

      The diet... *boom*. I  have  been busy though. Not that that's an excuse. I'll try harder this week.   Thunder in the Valley  The above mentioned is an annual motorcycle festival held in Johnstown, PA. This year, we at PPP had a booth in the FJP Conference Center downtown. It was a busy four days, and a busy three days preceding it as we tried to prepare for something we had no prior experience with. It was a learning experience for us, to say the least. I'm taking tomorrow and Tuesday off!   Waterworks won't shut off.  Must be hormones. I'm going to quit taking those blasted birth control pills. I used to have nice, regular cycles with nice, brief periods (not that everyone needs to know about my cycles, har har). But since I've been on these pills, I have PMS for about 2 weeks before a 7-day period. And I think (in spite of what I've read) that the pills are at least partially responsible for my raving appetite. So they went in the trash today. Sex is overrated, anyway.  :-P    Anyway, about those waterworks...  I have been missing my brother  so terribly , it hurts to the core. I know part of it is hormones, and the conclusion of PMS will take the edge off the anguish. Another part of it is his ex-girlfriend and her brother helped us out at Thunder, and they just remind me so much of him. And how much I wish he was here.    Fire and Rain  As we were coming home, exhausted, on Saturday night, James Taylor's  Fire and Rain  came on the radio. Dan and my sister always appreciated James Taylor but I'd never really honestly listened to any of his songs. The lyrics really hit home. Today I did a little research on the Internet regarding its origins, and it is about the suicide of a friend. Appropriate.    Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  Dan the plans they made put an end to you  I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  I just can't remember who to send it to    I've seen fire and I've seen rain  I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend  But I always thought that I'd see you again

      I only did some weightlifting when I meant to do 45 minutes of interval training on the elliptical. But predictably, I dozed off at 7:30 and, upon waking at 8:30, felt too sluggish to go work out. Bah. Excuses, excuses! Eating was pretty decent, though.   Today's off to a good start.  It's a beautiful day, and even though I overslept, it's  Saturday , so I'm not going to beat myself up for it. I've eaten well so far. Sat in the sun and read for a long time... gotta get that Vitamin D fix, ya know?  ;-)  Anyway, I have every intention of doing that interval training today. Then I need to shower and shave my nasty old pits... heheh... and then I reckon Brion and I may do something tonight. (Key word:  may .) Bring on the rum and diet Cokes!

      Oy! So I guess I have another purpose with this Blog. Since nobody reads it anyway, I'm just going to use it to keep track of my DIET! Oops... I mean, my LIFESTYLE CHANGE! (This being my second one in as many years, har har) A little background on that:   2002  I was never a tiny person, but I really porked up in college. I'm only 5'1" and I weighed in at about 175 lbs. Yikes! Too many pizzas and pints of cookies-n-cream at 4 AM! I was in denial, because you know how friends and family are... "Gads, no, you're not THAT big!" Yeah, I was. One day in April I decided I was done with being fat. So I counted calories, ate right most of the time, and exercised at least every other day. And I lost 50 lbs. Go, me! Felt great! But then...   January 2003  My brother dies unexpectedly. Suddenly, the term LIFESTYLE CHANGE had more to do with that than my eating and exercise habits. Over the past year, I've regained about 15 of those 50 lbs that I worked so hard to lose. The shame!   Today  I actually hauled ass out of bed at 8 AM, exercised, and ate a reasonably healthy breakfast. (One medium scrambled egg, one slice of toast, 1 cup of orange juice, and a glass of WATER!) So I'm off to a good start. I'm hoping that by keeping track of my habits here I'll be motivated to keep it up.    I wanna look hot in my Jager tank and lucky jeans at Thunder in the Valley.  So there.
