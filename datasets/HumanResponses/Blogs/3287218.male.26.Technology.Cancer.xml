      I was out of the house this afternoon and I came back and on the porch was a box.  I knew that it was my router.  So I opened it and then found a brand spanking new router sealed in a box.  I was purley suprised.  I was expecting a white box with the refurbished router inside.  WOW.  I was very happy.  I am going to sell it to my dad(if he wants it).

      I have this computer that we will call "Alpha."  It is used as a server for hosting files for my friend.  Well this morning at sometime (I will still half asleep) it was making clicking noises. So I shut it off and went back to bed.  Well, I got up this morning around 8:30ish. I didn't feel like dealing with it.  I was going to go help my dad sell flowers at Messiah College's graduation.  But when I call him at 8:45 the flowers werent there.  So I didnt go.  I am sitting inmy apartment in the cool of the AC and I give a try to boot up this computer.  It turns on, no noise.  And it seems to be booting ok and I think its completely booted up.  Well....I have another program to connect to the server and see the screen...and that wont connect.  So I hooked up a monitor to it and during the loading of Windows 2000 it doesnt even begin to load.  It stops and of course my keyboard is dead so I cant reinstall.  Oh well....tough crap.  Off to Circuit City to buy a new keyboard.

      I am jobless.  This has been going on now for 3 months.  I was working for Earthlink (now EarthStink or EarthSuck) from late January 2003 to March 2004.  So I have been at the job for a year.  In December of 03, I signed on a yr lease for an apartment.  I also bought a car while working there.  I found out about this on January 8th of 2004.  I was not happy one bit.  It completely put a damper on my life.  Work sucked from that time on.  But we had more fun on the job than we did b4 we found out the closing.  All we had to do was stick it out and do a good job and not get fired.  If you got fired, you lost your severance bonus.  So January, February pass by and its now March.  Earthlink gave me a severance of about 1,900 and I was like awesome.  I got the check in the mail and was not pleased. I got only 1,200 of that.  700 of it went to taxes.  I could have really used that money.  Oh well.  Now its may and I have been living on unemployment for a few weeks.  I enjoy being unemployed but then again I hate it.  I need a job to pay the bills.  I am still looking and pursuing some leads.  I am looking into getting A+ certified.  So we shall see.

      There is this game that someone just told me about till 1:30 AM this morning.  It is not yet out, but it is going to be the best game there is.  It is called "Forgotten War."  It is being made by a friend of mine and he is an awesome programmer.  He explained the details of the game.  It is going to be an online game that is going to be multi operating system compatible (Windows, Linux, and Mac).  That is pretty good for a game to do.  The game is going to be like no other game that has been produced.  The main focus of the small team that is working on it, is Perfection.  They want the game to be perfect in every way.  That is basically all I have to say about the game.  One more thing, it has been in production for FOUR years.  WOW!!!!!  Ok, thats it.

      Last night a storm decided to roll through the area.  It was lightning and thundering all night till like 12.  So I went to a meeting that went till 9 pm.  Then I went to my house to make sure there was no water damage and then left to go a girl's house.  We watched a movie, "Brother Bear", and then I left around 11ish.  I went back the apartment and found that my computer rebooted, I log back on and realize that the internet is not working.  B4 I have a chance to do anything, my roommate unplugs the power to the router and modem.  He then reconnects it, still no go.  I then realize that the PC link is not coming on the modem.  I was not happy.    So I connected my computer directly to the modem and then procceded to get onto the net.  Sooo...the internet is working.  At this point my roommate had gone to bed.  Well...I decided to call Netgear (the manufacturer) and see what they could do for me.  I call them and the lady voice told me that I need to register my product to get a 90-day "warranty" for support on the router.  So I do and then I call them back.  I then get someone and he says, I cant find your router.  I was like "SHIT".  I registered it and then I realized that Netgear has 2 different forms to register.  So I fill out the correct one and then call back.  After 45 minutes of waiting on hold and troubleshooting, it comes down to an RMA.  So they tell me that I would need to pay shipping.  So I am like cool.  BUT they said that I would get a refurbed router.  I am like NO.  So I said, I will look into returning it and or buying a new one.  Ok...that was all last night....TIME FOR BED.................ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!   Now onto Monday...I get up around 9:30 and then go to Circuit City and buy the same router for $101, saved about $20.  So now I have the new router up and running.  And then it hit me.  I spend 5 bucks for shipping and then get a refurbished router and turn around and sell it.  HEHE...I AM SO SMART!!!!!!!!!  So I need to call Netgear and get an RMA setup and then go ship it today.  Thats all for today.  Something else might happen, who knows.

      Hello there.  It has been awhile since I have posted on here.  A few things have happened.  I still DO NOT have a job.  I do not have a GF (that will come at its proper time).  I still have my apartment, my cable internet, and my family.  Well...maybe not a lot has happened.  2 weekends ago my cousin graduated from Lancaster Mennonite School in Lancaster, PA.  I was able to attend and then go to a friends and family party in the afternoon.  That was fun.  Last friday, I finally took Belle in for a visit to the Vet.  She is now 6mo old and weighs 14 lb.  She is still hairy and cute as ever.  I also scheduled her for a spay.  She had that done today and I almost cried when I left the Vet's office.  My brother and I picked her up at 6:30 and on the way home she got sick and make some messes in my car.  When I left my house, she was very very docile and hasnt eaten anything since Saturday or Sunday.  I tried to give her some food, but she didnt take it.  Oh well...she will bounce back.  Thats all for right now.

      Hello, It has been sometime since I last posted on here.  I have been busy with laziness and other things.  Here is whats going on in my life:  1. I am working now.  I work for the Pennsylvania Radio Project Office in Harrisburg, PA.  I monitor tower sites for problems (power, no connectivity, etc) and fix them or get the process in motion to get them fixed.  It is a good job and hope it becomes full time.  2.  I just returned from Vacation.  I went out to Kansas (you know where Dorothy and Toto live).  My mom is from there and her family had a reunion.  So I took off work and went with them.  We (my dad, mom, brother and his gf) drove out to Kansas.  It is a 2-day drive but sometimes y0u can do it in one 24 hr period.  We get out to Kansas and have the reunion and spend alot of time with family.  We also spend nights in different people's homes.  This prooves to be interesting since each time I sleep in a different bed, I dont sleep very well.  But I managed.  So we visited alot with family and ate alot of food (diet time).  We left on Thursday morning at 10 am (mom makes us get off late).  We then stop for our lunch and supper somewhere in Columbia, Missouri.  At that point we make the decision to drive thru the night and arrive home between 7 and 8 am on Friday.  My brother drove from 3 pm to like 1 or 2 in the morning.  He took us from Missouri to Ohio and then my parents drove from Ohio to Pennsylvania.  (I was took tired to drive, I slept in the backseat of the van).  So this has been my life for the past few weeks.  Tomorrow I can go to church.  It will be my first time back to church since I started my new job.  So I am excited.
