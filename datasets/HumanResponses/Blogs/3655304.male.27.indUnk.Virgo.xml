      Mankind is an intelligent beast.  Few would argue that, at least in the whole scheme of things, we don't rely proportionately more on "learning" over "instinct" than any other organism on earth.  We humans do vary slightly genetically, some are predisposed to diseases, others more athletic, and arguably, some are more intelligent than others.  Intelligence, as many have said before, is difficult, perhaps impossible, to measure, and I'm not going to get into that here.  Granted, there are a few standout droolers and geniuses, but most of us fall in the middling range.  What I find hard to believe is how quick some are to dismiss others, or even themselves, as being, well, dumb.  How many times have I heard friends of mine self-consciously state that they don't think they are all that bright.  Others dismiss certain people as incapable of learning.  Now, granted, I can be hard on people too, but  I think there is a less fatalistic way of looking at peoples ability to learn.   Bear with me here, I have an analogy that guides the way I think of the nature/nurture debate.  Think of an excel spreadsheet having differnent IQs, say from 80 to 160, arranged in order from least to greatest along the top of a spreadsheet, as column headers.  Then down the sides, lets think of each row as an increment of time, say, seconds, or minutes.  Now, place a nail in the corner of each of the cells formed by the intersections of the columns and rows, like a grid of nails.   Have you ever seen one of those lottery, or Price is Right, games where you drop a ping-pong ball down from  the top, and it bounces its way down through the nails, changing direction repeatedly, unitil it finally reaches the bottom.  That is what I'm getting at.  So, little Jimmy's ping-pong ball gets dropped(i.e he is born) at say, 113, and Heather's at 134(genius caliber).  Now, each of their ping-pong balls begin their harried descent, hitting each nail and being driven one way or another.  Each nail represents an experience.  Say Jimmy hits a "parent made me feel good" nail at minute 98,567, and a "read a book" nail at minute 6,307,200, and leapt to the right, towards the higher IQ.  Heather hit a "someone abused me sexually" nail at minute 4,324,899 and went way left.  Now imagine the height of the drop these ping pong balls have to face, thousands and thousands of minutes of time, each one effecting their brains in some way, miles and miles of nails.  Even if we give each IQ point say, 50 feet of space, do you not think that the accumulated experiences of life will eventually dictate where those ping-pong balls end up more than some minor variation in initial intelligence?  I do.  Sure reality is more complicated than that.  But I think it is a positive way of thinking about things.  I never assume someone is really that much less intelligent than I or anyone else, but I do feel there is a profound difference in the accumulated experiences any two people have:  the number of books they read, their choice of television programs, what they spend their time doing, the friends they make, the parents they have, the environment where they live.  What's the take home message, don't write anyone, including yourself, off.  Feeling down?  Have a conversation nail, read a book nail, or see the world nail.

              Anyone paying attention to the 2004 Presidential race realizes the importance that religion is playing.  An overwhelming majority of strongly religious people support Bush, and an even more overwhelming majority of non or semi-religious people support Kerry.  I know that I, as a skeptic, dislike Bush's appeals to higher powers and gut instincts over knowledge and rational reasoning.  I feel that the Religious support his moral stances and more importantly, distrust irreligious people as lacking morality.  As I take one of my daily walks around the parking lot outside my office building, pacing like a caged animal, I often pose questions to myself as if I were a presidential candidate answering questions from the press.  Religion would really be an issue, and it is clearly not common for politicians to admit if they are not religious, which I would do.  One must tread a fine line, to prove to the religious that you DO have a strong moral sense, and that you won't be machiavellian when it comes to making decisions if you were to arrive at the White House.  As Ron Reagan Jr. recently said, there is a lot of false peity in politics.          So what would I say?  How would I try to be true to my principles?  I would pose a number of questions:  Have you ever met a good person who was not religious?  I bet all but the most insulated have, and those that haven't probably  haven't had contact with ANY irreligious people.  Have you ever met a bad person who was religious?  I bet you have.  Many people who are troubled turn to religion, either to try and curb their desires, or to repent towards the end.  As can be seen by recent church scandals, religion often doesn't work.  As far as repentence, if there is a truly just god, I hope he/she weighs the trip to heaven or hell based on the overall positive/negative footprint left on the earth, not  if you begin drinking a little wine every Sunday for a few years after a life of crime, ignorance, and cruelty.          Why does any organized religion have a monopoly on morals?  Granted, religion evolved to provide a moral framework for mankind.  Before organized systems of justice existed, the easiest way to stop people from doing harm to others was to convince them that some bad shit was going to go down once they died if they did what they did.  Even so, there still remained people who commited horrendous crimes, often in the name of religion, and so we had to develop a better system, a more rational approach, which is what the justice system provide.  The judicial system says, do bad stuff, and we'll punish you now, where we have control.  Relgious or not, nobody wants to be murdered, or robbed, and so those thing are anethema to the majority of us.  So, instead of relying on mystical beliefs in heaven and hell, which may or may not be true, we now have  a system of justice that judges people here on earth.  Although people have differing ideas of what is a crime and what is not, there are certainly some we can all agree on, so morality at its core is present in all societies and all people.  In fact, the biggest obstacle to justice is when people are moved to make decisions based on their interpretion of religion.  How does one convince a jihadi that what he is doing is wrong when he has a book, dictated by god through his ghost writer Mohammed, that he can interpret to say just the opposite.  What we need is to eliminate calls to religion as justifiable rationale, be it from the Bible, the Koran, or the mouth of a preacher.          Now, I realize that some people, say serial killers, say that they carried out their darkest desires because they no longer feared for their souls.  that presents an interesting point, but I feel those people wouldn't be stopped anyway.  Lets, for the benefit of the doubt, concede that there are those that may have been prevented from doing what they did had they believed in religion.  What we must do is replace fear of God with the fear of the judicial system.  Granted, some will commit crimes, but they do that anyway.          We must approach morality not from a mystical view, but rather a rational one.  Let justice and laws deal with crimes  we can all agree on; murder, robbery, rape.  Lets stop listening to people who lived 2,000 years ago and who's moral viewpoint was vastly different from our own anyway.   It does no good as the president of the US to call on "our God" in response to the attacks by "their God."  We need someone who sees a situation rationally, who explores the options, and is well-read on the subject before he makes a decision.  That exploration of fact is what I would use to try and convince voters that I would be the best man for the job.            Religion is a belief system, just because you don't subscribe to an "organized religion," doesn't mean you lack a belief system, which I think we all have.  My personl belief system is a scientific one, I concern myself with things that we can study, and hope I would alter my beliefs if more evidence came in, even if it were contrary to what I previously believed.  Religion relies on faith, and  therefore there is no way to support or discount it.  That is the fundamental difference between religion and science.          Remember, nobody knows what happens after death, so denying the existence of god is equally irrational as saying he exists--nobody knows.

              I was driving around the other day and just happened to pass two cars with big, shiny hubcaps, low bodies, and tinted windows.  I saw two late 20s to 30 something year old men, stooped in the front seat, music blaring.  I thought about all the rap music I listen to  which seems to espouse above all else the worth of a man as the type of car he drives, the jewelry he wears, and most ridiculously, the diameter of his hubcaps.  I thought, there are thousands and thousands of adolescent males and females of all races and economic backgrounds that have somehow been led to believe that what is important in life is to have rims on your tires that stay spinning while you sit at a stoplight.          Neither of the gentlemen I passed that day were economically well-off, but their cars were well-kept.  I think one was a Ford Escort.  Who knows, and I know I'm stereotyping here, they probably have a few children here and there, a bad job, an unhappy woman or two, no real future.  Yet ignorant kids all over probably go googaw over those rims.  Hell, it must be a source of pride for them.  Maybe some street kids think they are "the man,"  maybe they love to hear "damn, look at them rims!"  Maybe they actually convince some down-on-her-luck hoochie mama that they are worth something and get laid on occasion because of it.  They probably watch "Pimp my Ride" on MTV, or at least have some admirers that have.  I know, because for some short period of time in Jr. High School I too knew the names of the older guys who would drive past the school and rattle the windows.          Funny, now I have just the opposite reaction.  I take one look at these people and think, what a sucker.  You materialistic moron, don't you think I can see straight through the fact that your values show how ignorant you are?  Don't you think I pity the children of the idiot that somehow thinks that by squandering his money on  a few shiny baubles for his car and driving around he can somehow make me look twice at him?   I know what you are.          Now I realize that this isn't a new theme.  People have always envied and emulated wealth.  People used to horde jewelry as a source of wealth in hard times.  People preferred to have something solid that wouldn't lose its worth as quickly as paper currency, and you could maybe say that in this day and age $20,000 rims would be sucked up by a pawn shop just as easily as a diamond ring,   But I think it's a bit simpler than that.  Truth is,  these people want to show off, to appear like something they aren't, to feel self worth.  I understand that.  I just want them to know that that I'm not impressed.  Go get a job, love your kids, drive a shitty car and buy little Jimmy a Wal-Mart bike.  Teach your kids the value of being honest, laugh at yourself, invest in your future.  If you do that, maybe someone over the age of 17 will respect you.

             We're going to talk a bit about the office of the presidency, and more specifically, the qualifications of obtaining that title.  Now, setting aside the differences one may or may not have about Mr. Bush, I want to figure out exactly what it is that earned him the presidency.  In so doing, I inevitably have to compare him to his predecessor, primarily because many would agree that they voted for Mr. Bush after Mr. Clinton "stuck his cigar in the vagina of the presidency."   	So let me get this straight, people voted for Bush to restore faith in the presidency right?  Now Clinton came from a moderately poor background, Arkansas(need I say more), studied abroad at Oxford, was a Rhodes Scholar, and essentially through sheer charisma and intelligence rose up to be president.  That doesn't give anybody faith in his abilities as president?  Now, Clinton did make some poor decisions, he cheated and he lied about his PERSONAL LIFE. 	Contrast this to Bush, who we all know came from privilege, was mediocre in everything he did, and never was successful in anything at all, yet still became president.  His speaking skills are abhorrent.  His religious views ignorant.  His social skills....well there we can't knock the man, I mean 50 years of parties should be ample experience for that.  But this is what really gets me...he doesn't read.  He shows no intellectual curiosity.  Let us forgive, to some extent, the blue collar guy who never had time to do much reading between night shifts and raising children and who knows little about the world, but this guy, this man who never really had anything to do but accumulate wealth, how has he so squandered his time?  He admits he doesn't read newspapers, yet he has been chosen to run the government of the United States, and make complicated domestic and international decisions for the entire world?  He has never, to my knowledge, lived abroad, and I'm sure the traveling he has done most likely consisted of MetLife vacations and staying with rich business colleagues. He certainly has never known the plight of the common man. 	The point is this, I used to respect the office of the presidency because I felt that whoever has gotten to that level had some kind of qualifications that set him above the rabble.  I respect knowledge, ability, and intelligence in dealing with the realities of the world.  I just don't see it with Bush.  He isn't a good speaker, he doesn't have any expertise in any aspect of government.  I not only feel that Bush is ignorant of reality, as his appeals to higher powers and intellectual disdain proudly proclaim, but that he has gotten to where he is not through personal ability, but because others want him to be there.  Why would others want him there?  That is the scary question, as big business and special interests fall all over each other to give him money.  Maybe Bush's one real qualification is assuring a friction-free path from money to favor, and he does so with a congenial smile that makes you, well, feel guilt free. 	If Clinton found a way to piss on the presidency, then Bush made his own stain with the way he has become a shining example of how little talent a person can have to become president, which should give pause to anyone who at one time looked up to that exalted position as the head of the United States.

      	The issue of gay rights has become a polarizing issue here in Missouri, as conservative politicians attempt to ban gay marriage here in our state.  Once again I am awestruck by the hypocrisy of people who support the call for this discriminatory amendment, while they support the USs spreading of "freedom" in Iraq and elsewhere.  What is fundamentally different about banning gays from marrying, and banning women from showing their faces? 	Most of us now look backward and see the segregation of blacks and whites as barbaric, at least publicly, but earlier this century a similar battle was waged between people who wanted to "maintain racial purity" and forward leaning people who saw how ridiculous this argument was.  These eloquent mouthpieces for racism invoked the same type of puritanical argument we now see in those that becry the dirtying of the institution of marriage.  One thing is for sure, enjoy the argument now, because in 40 years you too will go down in history as ignorant brutes, because the young, like always, bring with them new ideas as society changes. 	When will it end?, they say, will we next permit relations with children and dogs?  Poor argument.  Two adults who consent to have a relationship is choice, children and animals must be protected from people who try to choose for them. 	It will destroy the family, they say.  Hey, if you still live in the black and white world of homosexual=bad, and heterosexual=good, then you have never progressed beyond the level of saturday morning cartoons.  People of any race or persuasion can be good or bad, and I would certainly rather have my child raised by two loving lesbians than some redneck who beats his wife.  Spend some time judging character. 	We can't have two names for things, separate but equal doesn't work.  Marriage for heterosexuals, civil union for homos.  What we need is a simple way of treating us all equally, but satisfying the morons until they die off and more progressive people can come around.  I'm not gay, I don't know why people are gay, but they exist, and have existed for time immemorial, and so we have to accept that fact and embrace it. 	The simple fact is, aside from the rhetoric, there is a great compromise that can be reached.   If we really believe in freedom and equality under the law, then lets have Civil Unions for any two consenting adults that desire it.  Civil Unions can be the all-encompassing name that permits us all equal rights to form a relationship and financially support one another.  Concerned that your sacred institutution of marriage is being spit on?, then get married in your own church, where you can sit and enjoy reading obscure passages in the Bible in an attempt to justify whatever it is you want to justify.   	Last but not least, a lot of people are most repulsed by the idea of these, these, GAYS, raising adopted children.  What will happen then?  I'll tell you what, you leave your kid with Leroy and Sandy, the alcoholic, child abusing, cross dresser that you see at church and his meek, whipped wife, while I leave mine with Randy and Steve, the really nice gay couple who live next door , the Doctor and the writer, the ones that accept other people for what they are and who treat us with kindness.

      I wanted to spend a little more time bashing Bush, and Cheney for that matter. &nbsp;George was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. &nbsp;So what, so was almost every other president that we've had. &nbsp;That is not necessarily a bad thing. &nbsp;After all, perhaps not having to eke out a miserable existence would allow a bit more time for education and reflection. &nbsp;That certainly seems to be the case with some of our great leaders. &nbsp;However, Bush didn't have any intellectual curiosity. &nbsp;The question is, how can someone have so much, and yet have learned so little. &nbsp;Bush's greatest &nbsp;asset, it seems, is that he is just about as ignorant of the issues as the masses he goes about screwing. &nbsp;As Bill Maher says, about half of America wants to guide the boat of state with a compass, and about half by examining the viscera of a recently killed chicken. &nbsp;Bush wants to be guided by the layout of the chicken guts. &nbsp;Ironically, many minorities, many being poorly educated, also buy in to Bush's social views, as well as poor whites. &nbsp;Therefore, the rich love him, because he lines their pockets and does what they say, and many poor like him, even to their own detriment, because they share the same ignorant views on a wide range of topics.   Bush is a decisive leader, the people say when asked by the pollers. &nbsp;I ask about what? &nbsp;He sure didn't share any real vision about the environment, or about world affairs, or about technology, or science, or the economy. &nbsp;In fact, Bush not only doesn't know a lot about any particular subject, it seems to me he doesn't know a little about a lot of subjects. &nbsp;But, sadly, his black and white views of the world make complicated issues seem simple to &nbsp;many an ignorant American. &nbsp;His good/evil view of certain people and countries makes him sadly popular with those who never progressed beyond looking at life like a soap opera, with ugly, bad people, and pretty, good people. &nbsp;The shades of gray seem beyond his comprehension, and if he has evaluated all sides of an issue, he sure sticks to the typical "freedom" and "evil doers," dumb-downed approach to dealing with us. &nbsp;Do people really believe that crap? &nbsp;Looks like they do.&nbsp; I think, to be balanced, that it's ironic that Hollywood, a liberal bastion, is responsible in some ways for creating idiots like Bush by producing dumbed down shows with black and white characters in soap operas, sitcoms, tv shows, and sitcoms.&nbsp; These people have a real opportunity to show the depth of humanity, instead of superficial good and evil caricatures, and I wish they would do so.&nbsp;   Another note. Cheney, his supporters say, is a man of integrity. Well I question this to the core. Isn't a man judged by how he treats his own family above all else. Here is a man with a lesbian daughter. Here is a man who claimed to be in favor of equality for gays in the run-up to the 2000 elections. But here is a man who places politics above his own daughter and supports an amendment that writes discrimination of gays into the Constitution. I think that is sick. It's a modern day equivalent to the half-black daughter of Strom Thurmond, a man who fought against civil rights for much of his career, a daughter hidden for her entire life, plied with gifts, but never acknowledged for fear of political consequences.

      The world, according to Bush and supporters, is a much safer place now that Saddam has been removed from power. &nbsp;Saddam, of course, did pose a slight risk, albeit much less of a risk than we were led to believe. &nbsp;That said, I can't imagine a bigger fallacy than that we now are a safer country. &nbsp;Osama is still alive, Iraq is in turmoil, and our world standing is at an all time low. &nbsp; Is not hate, be it irrational or rational, the driving force for terrorism? &nbsp;Have not the policies of the Bush administration isolated us from the rest of the world, both allies and non-allies alike? &nbsp;Are we not, by far, the most detested country on the planet? &nbsp;Anyone who has lived outside the US knows this, and if we equate hate with terrorism, the argument should end there. &nbsp;And the sad thing is, I love Americans. &nbsp;I think we are, in general, a progressive, kind, and happy lot. &nbsp;It sickens me the way we all pay for the behavior of our government and the wealthy that command it. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Now, just to put things into perspective, what will happen the next time terrorists strike? &nbsp;How many people think the hearts of all the world will be mourning? &nbsp;Ahhhh, thats what I thought. &nbsp;We did have support after 9/11, an outpouring of grief and anger at the terrorists. &nbsp;But, thanks to Bush and his cronies, he made a spectacular turnaround. &nbsp;Bush, thank you for making the victim, not the attacker, look like the guilty party. &nbsp;How did he do this, well, one, he talked in general, silly terms about freedom, he is such a poor orator, while he hypocritically bombed and tortured the people he was liberating, and he defied the world, which was trying to preach moderation. &nbsp;So, the truth is, the next time something happens, a lot more people are going to think we deserved this.  &nbsp; In addition to public sentiment, another weakness has been exposed by the Bush Admin. &nbsp;Our military is spread thin, we are fighting a needless battle in Iraq, while more dangerous countries, Iran, Korea, and others, now see our fragility. &nbsp;Do you think they are worried about our allies coming to save us, no. &nbsp;We have lost all credibility with out allies be crying wolf in Iraq. &nbsp;Nobody trusts our intelligence, nor our president, so why would they stop producing nuclear weapons, Iran is case in point. &nbsp;Who will come to our aid? &nbsp;Maybe we can convince the Moluccas to send another 20 peacekeepers, because our biggest supporters; Britain, Spain, and Italy, have populations very hostile to us. &nbsp;Bush tried to make it seem like the coalition did exist, but it was a LIE!!! &nbsp;Everyone is pulling out, and places where the government, most likely through bribery or blackmail, decided to stand with us, the population was opposed. &nbsp;In Spain, 90% of the people opposed aiding the US military effort in Iraq. &nbsp;Now the Spanish gov't that supported Bush is gone. &nbsp;No politician with any sense would stand with us now.  &nbsp; So, to summarize, we have one opportunity as a people to distance ourselves from the current government, and proclaim, "This is not us," by not reelecting Bush. &nbsp;If we don't, then we are just as guilty of stupidity as Bush and Co. were. &nbsp;It's our only chance to once again earn some respect in the world.

      I've been bashing Bush for a while now, I think its time to qualify the "moderate", in my moderately liberal stance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  One, I believe that liberals tend to overprotect the downtrodden. &nbsp;Lets face the facts, some people in our country have got to take responsibility for themselves. &nbsp;I believe, for example, that government functions to provide safety for the population. &nbsp;If times are rough, those that have prospered should provide some of their income for those who are suffering, to insure the health of not only those that receive the money, but for those who give it. &nbsp;After all, a desperate man is not a law abiding man, and government distribution can buffer the swings in the economy. &nbsp;However, I feel that if the government(and hence the taxpayers), is footing your bill, you have entered into an agreement with society as a whole. &nbsp;Responsibly, if you borrowed money, you wouldn't go on a spending spree, or continue to have babies you can't afford. &nbsp;Why should welfare be any different. &nbsp;Take money, lose some freedoms until the government stops paying for you. &nbsp;The main one would be to stop benefits to women who continue to have children when on welfare. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Secondly, although free trade is a complicated issue, I think I support it, which most liberals do not. &nbsp;One, interdependence among nations tends to foster relationships, protectionism leads to bitterness and squabbling. &nbsp;Every time the democrats complain about "outsourcing" I shudder. &nbsp;Are not the Indians/Chinese people too? &nbsp;Why, if those people are willing to work for less, should we not encourage them to prosper, all things being equal. &nbsp;Now, we must demand that they uphold the environmental and labor standards we use, but I feel that if they faced the pressure of losing the American commerce, they would come around to doing so. &nbsp;It seems liberal don't really want an even playing field when it comes to International trade. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Thirdly, abortion. &nbsp;Always a touchy subject. &nbsp;It just seems somewhat contrary to the typical liberal philosophy: &nbsp;no death penalty, equality, but lets kill babies. &nbsp;Personally, I don't necessarily think that every baby born is good. &nbsp;Rapes, screwed up families, etc...but who are we to decide? There is a compromise that can be met, and I don't know which side is worse at not arriving at it. &nbsp;Waiting 24 hours to make an abortion decision doesn't seem like such a horrible thing to me, I don't know why some liberals think that is ridiculous. &nbsp;My views: &nbsp;educate about birth control(that's a conservative problem), have morning after pills, ban late term abortions except in cases of rape, if the woman is a few weeks pregnant, make her think about it for a while. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Death penalty. &nbsp;I don't know how much it prevents crime, but it sure as hell gives victims justice. &nbsp;It must be used carefully, and I think DNA evidence will absolve plenty of people, but I'm not necessarily opposed to it. &nbsp;True, some innocent people get put in prison unfairly, but, you know, most of them get fingered because they hadn't exactly been law abiding citizens in the past. &nbsp;Lesson is, don't rape kids if you don't want to look suspicious when a little boy's body shows up. These are just a few of my complaints against the liberals.

      Wasn't there a time when people were envious of us? Wasn't there a time when we were breaking away from the failures of the past, proclaiming a bright future?  Why does everyone hate us?  Hadn't we overcome fanaticism and persecution?  Did we not say separation of church and state?  Then why is the government pandering to the religious right, and wearing their Christianity on their sleeves?  Wasn't there a time when we accepted science over religion, using evidence and not supposition?  Then why are politicians trying to stop our quest for answers?  Why are we hated?  Hadn't we finally come to treasure our natural resources, determined to protect them for our children?  Then why are we shunning the Kyoto accords, rejecting signs of Global Warming, loosening restrictions on pollution, on endangered species, on water quality, on logging?  Why are we all driving SUVs?  Wasn't there a time in our history when we were finally getting over the prejudices of the past? Didn't we stand for equality?   Then why are we banning gays from marriage?  Wasn't there a time when we were viewed as liberators?  Why does the world now hate us?  Weren't we a democracy, then why do the little people have no voice in government, only the big corporations?  Why are we doubling back, is that why they hate us?

      I wrote this a few weeks ago and forgot to post it.  Supporters of the War on Iraq tend to believe that the US in the greatest country on earth, and that the Iraqis represent a threat to them.  They feel that we must do what we must do, ie the ends justify the means, to keep America free.  Now, on the surface, this is incredibly hypocritical if we really look at it.  I mean, everyone who has their own ideology feels this way, and so our belief that we are right is no different than Saddam thinking he was right.  Ironically, we are now doing the same kinds of things we criticized Sadam for.   It seems that maybe to control a country such as Iraq, violence and torture are somewhat necessary, at least that is how both Saddam and Bush's minions have responded.            Those opposed to war in Iraq, on the other hand, feel that we have no right to impose our beliefs on others, and also seem to have a more "glass half full" feeling about the innate goodness of human beings, and they don't feel America or the West have a monopoly on rightousness.  All we need is to stop doing bad things to them and all will be better.          The same war is being fought domestically.  Conservatives think some people are innately lazy, bad, or stupid, and really don't want to create societal dependence, nor be robbed of their hard earned taxes.  Hard-core liberals feel that "the man" is at fault, and tend to blame external forces for social problems, never blaming the people for their own predicament.  The answer, in my view, lies in between.  Certainly some people are born better off, and they should recognize this and feel some empathy for those with less, but lets face it, some people are downright shit; lazy, dangerous, and ignorant.          So where does the Arab world fall in this scheme.  Certainly, they have poor leaders, mostly quasi-religious governments that do little to help their people.  But lets never lose sight of the fact that these people are dangerous.  Most conflicts in the world involve Muslims.  They base their decisions on religious ideology, and Islam IS a militant religion.  They oppress their women, and in many senses that may be a major part of the problem, since women tend not to be so violent as men, and in societies where they are on a roughly equal footing, may help to neutralize the male tendency toward conflict. No, not all Muslims are terrorists, but lets face it, terrorism on this scale can not exist without the support of the people, and the rejoicing after 9/11  and utter silence about Muslim atrocities against Americans says it all.  Saudi Arabian citizens, for example, have more money than they know what to do with, but instead of being productive, they live lives of anger and ignorance.  Rarely do I meet people who have lived in another country who don't have positive things to say about where they stayed.  Saudi Arabia is a big exception, luring people with financial incentives, but leaving them with disgust at Saudi society, and all who I've spoken with have expressed contempt for the place.          The June 30th withdrawal date is a case in point.  Regardless of how bad Bush and Co. have squandered public opinion by the ousting of Saddam, we cannot deny that the Bush admin. is now planning to get out.  Be it for the right or wrong reasons, he seems to be doing exactly what the Arab world is calling for.  Even so, with all signs pointing to the handover, what has happened?  Have the Arab militants become satisfied?  No.  Have they realized that they will now only be hurting other Arabs?  No, in fact they are trying to drive wedges between various factions, and wreaking devastation on their own people, and you know who gets the blame from the Arab world?  The US.   So, irregardless of the mistakes we have made, which have been numerous, we must concede that once the Arabs get their way, they aren't going to settle down and become chefs and comedians any time soon.          The point is this, and I know it's been said before, although we should and do criticize the mishandling of the Arab world by the American government, lets not lose sight of the fact that up to the election of Bush and Co., the US has traditionally been one of the most progressive nations in the world.  That said, we must recognize that the Arab world has major problems of their own, and never lose sight of the fact that they are trying to wage war on us as well.

      So stuffy ol Kerry chose Edwards.  Edwards, of course, has a number of characteristics lacking in Kerry, and for that matter the Republican competition.  Edwards has a drawl, but has oratory skills are quite good.  He is young, dynamic, good-looking, and positive.  The contrast of Edwards with Cheney is getting a lot of press.  Cheney, by any stretch of the imagination, cuts a pretty seedy profile.  His big business connections, stooped, balding appearance, and snarling speeches don't strike a positive chord, even for Republicans, some of whom would certainly like to see another VP on Bush's ticket.          Who knows what Bush will do, but his loyalty is emphasized as a major selling point.  Of course, I think Bush would be lost without Cheney, who serves two purposes:  1, he keeps the heat off Bush by taking on the role of bad-guy, saying the sleazy things we like to think our president wouldn't stoop low enough to say, and 2, he is probably the malevolent mind behind most of the policies Bush pursues.          The Republicans will pull out all the stops to put Edwards down.  They seem like defense lawyers, not really tackling the facts, just trying to slip seeds of doubt into the minds of the jury.  It will be fun to see lawyer Edwards destroy their arguments in debates.  Bush, when asked to define the difference between Edwards and Cheney, said, "Dick Cheney can be President," implying that Edwards can't.  Let's dissect this, first of all, would we want Cheney to be president?  Is it possible to have a more negative opinion of a man than what the general populace sees in Dick Cheney?  Secondly, why could he better serve as president than Edwards, is it the experience factor?  After all, according to what I heard, Bush, before becoming president, had exactly the same number of years of political experience as Edwards, and he became President(illegally, of course).  The Republicans emphasize Edwards' lack of foreign policy experience, in particular.  What foreign policy experience did Bush have?  The man was embarrassed before the 2000 elections when it was pointed out how few world leaders he knew, he doesn't read newspapers, and his foreign policy can best be described as "Anger the World."  The best that can be said for Kerry/Edwards, if they are elected, is that they will owe their ascendancy to voters desirous of an anti-Bush, and I think they are savvy enough politicians not to blunder down the same arrogant path Bush and Crew have tread.          Finally, the other criticism is that Edwards, like Bush, Kerry, and Cheney, is a rich white man, which destroys the credibility of Edwards' populist message.  Recognizable Republicans can't really take this tack, but their supporters will be willed to stress Edwards' wealth to try and dismantle his appeal to the downtrodden.  Edwards is wealthy, but the difference, as many have pointed out, is Edwards' rise not through nepotism, but personal ambition and ability.   Edwards is a self-made man, and we can assume that if he is smart enough, likeable enough, and educated enough to make millions as a lawyer, then he can certainly evolve into a positive role as VHF.  Watching 60 minutes, I think Mrs. Edwards brought up a good point in response to the fact that Kerry and Edwards have money.  Both, she said, voted against the tax cuts for the rich.  And since both would have benefited from the cuts, I agree with her when she said that voting against something in your best interest is a sign of integrity.

      I found em both in the trash.  I had made the mistake of delving into a magazine, the Brittney Spears/Federline thing.  I can’t figure out why I’m fascinated by that stuff but thenextthingyou know wally and the puppy had pulled it all out. Martha was sitting playing solitaire on the computer, she too had made the mistake.  Mistake was, if you actually find yourself by yourself it means that wally has found something really good.  Really good(for wally)=really bad(for parents), that’s algebraic.  Anyhow, normally, had grandpa and grandma not been with wally all day, I would have probably been angry.  Wally thought I was angry, and when I grabbed her she fake-cried all the way back to her bedroom.  Somehow I found it funny the dog and her, and I just threw her down on the bed and started tickling her.  There is something very similar about crying and laughing, and she seamlessly changed from the former to the latter.  The dog, cochina, got involved.  I quickly realized that wally and cochina were at the same relative maturity level.  Both were into the whole chase thing.  Wally wanted me to chase her.  Cochina wanted me to chase her.  I chased them both for a while, but got tired and ran back to the bed.  Wally hopped up and started poking me in the eye, getting a little too rough with me.  The dog was excited and started biting the bed cover.  I realized I’d gotten them a little too riled up.  I tried to settle it down by getting up. The dog nipped wally, and wally wanted some attention so taddled by crying.  I wondered how people conceive of such a difference between humans and all other animals.

      We people, though we like to try and supress the fact, are pretty emotional things.  After the 9/11 attacks we were mad and scared, like a puppy who you try to catch and it snaps at you.  In fact, at times when I think of  Bush as somewhat benign, I think of him as a clumsy puppy, learning, but making big mistakes as he wheels around trying to understand the world, knocking things over and chewing things up as he matures.            At other times, however, I'm not so forgiving.  It seems pretty well documented to me that Bush had been focused on Iraq since the outset of his presidency, at least thats the impression given by Richard Clark and Bob Woodward.  When you get attacked by someone, as was the case of 9/11, it seems perfectly rational to me that we would destroy Al Qaeda's benefactors, the Taliban.  When you get attacked, and are left somewhat vulnerable, the last thing you would think to do was anger somebody else.  At the least you would think you would want to let things cool down, sort things out, take care of first things first.  I mean, we had been pressuring Saddam for a long time with sanctions.  He had been resisting us in some capacity for some time, we had weapons inspectors in the country, what was the big rush?  Why did we insist on not waiting for support from the rest of the world?  If you are a businessman you don't start one thing, put yourself in debt, then start something new before squaring away what you already had going.  Unless of course you are a bad businessman, or conditions are really favorable.            So, were conditions really favorable?  I think they were.  I think the Bush administration deliberately played on the American peoples sense of anger, bewilderment and fear to do something rash and shortsighted, something they had wanted to do all along.  At a time when the immaturity of mass hysteria needed to be bottled by a mature, calming leadership, our president and his cronies surfed the emotional wave right into Iraq.  Where were the chief and the elders who always calmed the hot blood of the warriors.  Funny, the chief was beating the drums of war.  So, the million dollar question is why?  I have a few theories on that.  Perhaps, ideologically, they really believed that we would be embraced.  Of course, most educated people saw the extreme fallacy in that argument, and that isn't looking back with 20/20 vision, as some of us predicted that when the drums were just starting to beat.  In Ecuador, perhaps, I had the opportunity to see a different perspective on the war.  A more removed, rational reaction by the media and the people around me.  I would read the paper daily, wondering why the hell this man was so obviously intent on going to Iraq no matter what.            Bush and Co. have been removed from the mainstream for a long time.  They began socializing with Iraqi dissidents, along with their rich campaign contributers("the haves and the have mores," Bush's "base."), and energy execs.  I can picture now how the Iraq plan developed.  First it was a backroom promise to untap the wealth of Iraq for America.  Then it transformed into a responsibility to his elite supporters, and finally, in a twist became a responsiblity to the American people, for their own protection.  A kind of greedy frenzy of profits for big energy companies, the dissidents, the US leaders, and this is the great part, it would also benefit the Iraqi and American people.   Hell, they'd been tracking what was going on in Iraq for a long time, making a list, checking it twice.     But how can we convince the American people how dangerous he isandthat oil just sitting thereandthose poor Iraqi people...     They could take over everything AND be seen as liberating an oppressed people.  It really wasn't the perfect time strategically, but it sure was the right time emotionally. BOOM boom boom boom BOOM boom boom boom...

      It's been funny to see how up in arms people on the right are about Michael Moore's movie.  For me, though I agree with the ideology, I would have liked a bit less emotion and more refutation of fact.  I would have liked to have seen Moore toss up the arguments presented by the other side before letting them fall hard to the earth.  I feel that people who want to strike it down are much better able to when they can mouth their own doubts, unchallenged, as opposed to someone tackling all sides of an issue head on and logically destroying critiques.  I certainly could find some faults with the movie, mostly in how it didn't accurately portray the other side of the story.  One must admit that the other side exists, and it seems devious to ignore it.  Besides, the simple fact is that if we hold the neocon idea up to the light, there is so much there to destroy.  One part that irked me was when the main protagonist, I don't recall her name, that lost a son, went to Washington. There, a callous woman accused her of staging this, and someone said not to blame Bush, but Al Qaeda.  I think this is a common argument from the right, and not without some merit until one realizes, like a broken record, that Saddam and Al Qaeda are only linked in the minds of the neocons.  I also felt she made a fickle central figure, you can't spend your life supporting the flag and being angered by anyone who protests, then when times get rough start crying about it when your son dies.  I'm not saying it surprises me, I'm just saying that it was people like her that blindly followed Bush in the first place.  That said, I think its funny to hear people talk about the hate on the left.  Lets face it, most people hate Bush for his policies, not who he is.  Most of us would after all, prefer being at a barbecue with Bush than Kerry, and I can't say I would disagree.  Lets not, however, confuse wanting to hang out with good ol' Bush with wanting him to be our president. Bush's policies, to us lefties, are regressive and harmful to the image of the US that we like to think we have: progressive, free, and benevolent..  Most Clinton-haters, for example, admit that they didn't really mind Clinton's politics, they just hated the man.  That, to me, is much more dangerous and irrational than any hatred of the actual policies of a president.  Which really affects the world, a spooge stain or a bombing raid?  After all, lets make a choice, do we prefer a man who lies about war, or who lies about who he messed around with?  Here is a quote from this OpEd piece I recently read:  "What should not go unnoticed, however, is that Moore's drivel is endorsed by leaders of the Democratic Party - indeed, by the ex officio leader of the Democratic Party, Terry McAuliffe. He attended the opening and emerged to declare the film "very powerful - much more powerful than I thought it would be.""   -Mona Cheron   Now, this is REALLY ironic.  Cheney, the vice-president, has gone on the Rush Limbaugh show repeatedly.  The one place, besides FOX, where they are such lackeys they wouldn't dare to ask any tough questions, and unabashedly one of the most wack-job righties around.  So she's complaining that the leader of the Democratic Party found a movie "powerful", where the vice-president she supports makes policy decisions directly appealing to his rightwingnut base.  I mean, merely saying something is "powerful" that could potentially be a major boon to your organization is really showing restraint if you ask me.

      I've become somewhat fascinated by the outlandishness of our celebrities, particularly rappers and professional athletes. Many adorn themselves with multiple tattoos and more hideously, gold and silver teeth. Now, I don't know who sees the beauty in this, I mean, I can understand a tattoo or two, tastefully placed on the body, but a gleaming set of metal teeth, once the embarrassment of teenage girls, as a status symbol? The reality is, that though OK for multi-million dollar athletes, what does this do for the millions of imitators who need to find a real job. The answer is, not much. There are parallels here. Long finger nails, now a symbol of elegance in women, most likely evolved as desirous because it emphasized the status of a particular woman. Long ago, hard working commoners, unable to do their work without breaking nails, never had the leisure to grow and display them. The nobility, on the other hand, were able to subtly display their status by maintaining their long nails and hence their lack of need to work. So, if we combine these two observations, perhaps gold teeth and tattoos have come to symbolize the noblesse of their wearers, and hence their status as "above the rules," much like the elite of bygone eras.

      You know, before all this "terrorist" stuff went down,I thought that the biggest problem we had as a countrywas one of race. It seems to me that racism is alwaystalked about as if it is what white people do toothers. I disagree, and believe that the backlashagainst past discrimination, particularly by the blackcommunity, perhaps contributes mightily to racialantagonism today. Thats not to say that its wrong thata backlash should happen, but its time we stoppedteaching our people that "racism" is a white problem. It's everyone's problem. Unfortunately, racism hasbeen a part of humanity for time immemorial, andanyone who judges others by their skin color, or anyother racial characteristic, is racist, regardless ofwhat they themselves are. That said, I think thereare two lessons that should be taught, one to whites,and one to blacks(yeah I know there are other races,but asians seem to have met with a great deal ofsuccess here, and hispanics comprise a number ofdifferent racial groups). For blacks: White men are not innately evil. We arenot the oppressors, nor the hatemongers, of the world.Yes, some of our ancestors enslaved you, but slaveryhas been a part of human history for many thousands ofyears, all major cultures practiced it, and quitefrankly, ethnic groups within Africa sold theirneighbors into slavery quite readily. In fact, Africais one of the few places on earth where slavery stillexists. So, although we have a sad recent history ofslavery and discrimination, these things can, and arebeing, rectified, and there is certainly hope for thefuture.For whites: Until about 40 years ago, blacks were noton an "equal" playing field with whites, and thus wecannot expect their society to be without hardship andanimosity. Those whites that look at the economiccondition of the majority of blacks in this countryand think that blacks are somehow inferior or doomedneed recognize the little time given, less than ageneration, to pull themselves out of poverty andignorance(which poverty creates). Hell, a few generations ago we wereselling their children into slavery, so cut them abreak if their family values and ways of doing thingsare a bit different from your own. We must never losesight of how little time has passed since we began tocall blacks equal.It is hard for me to look at the racial tensions inthe US, and the world for that matter, without somefeeling of sadness. We are all human, and if we couldhave looked down on the world 2,000 yrs ago, a blinkin time, we would have seen groups of white Celts, furclothed, dancing around a campfire. We could haveseen black Bantus, black Pygmies, Native Americans,Incas, Vietnamese, all dancing around their owncampfires, each with some superficial variation ofdress and shelter, but really just about the same inevery respect.  As a white man, I realize Africans, Asians, Indians, are all people just like us.  Not people JUST like us, but PEOPLE...just like us.Every time I go outside, happily, I see more and moreinterracial couples, more interracial friends, moreinterracial children. It just takes a bit ofinteraction to realize we all share a common humanity,only isolation can create divisions.
