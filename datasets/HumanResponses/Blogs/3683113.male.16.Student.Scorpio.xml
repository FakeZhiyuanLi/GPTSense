       While you claim that Israel  urlLink "will not win the war for its security with its current approach" , it is clear that peace cannot be gained unless Israeli citizens do not feel in constant danger.   Just as the IDF offenses radicalize the Palestinian people, terrorist attacks and suicide bombings allow extremists in Israeli politics to thrive. Witness the Intifada’s ability to create support for Sharon’s. Moderates in both communites need to be empowered in order for there to be the possibility of peace. Even though many of Israel’s attempts to crush the Intifada are wrong and immoral, the ultimate defeat of such an offensive on innocent Israelis is a necessary prerequisite for peace. Without this ending, Isrealis fears will continue radicilize them.  One must find the middle path between the Israeli ultra-aggressiveness and your proposed relative-passivity that will empower both Palestinian and Israeli moderates.   Here's my response: Israel can put down radical violent opposition through a constructive security policy that engages with the more moderate elements in Palestinian society. The best way to stop terrorism is to marginalize the terrorists and make Palestinians want to stop terrorism themselves. Right now, Palestinians see no reason to stop terrorism. When there was a peace process, the Israelis kept on building settlements and harrasing Palestinians at checkpoints. Palestinians have no light at the end of the tunnel and so they support or - at the very least - don't try to stop desperate terrorism.  I'd also be interested to know how you found this blog. I'm looking for ways to publicize it, so if anyone (not just this anonymous poster) gets interested in this blog, please let me know how you came across it.

      I have a letter in today's edition of  The Washington Post . It appears in the paper as follows (you can find the opinion piece that I'm responding to  urlLink here ):   urlLink  Page A16, Tuesday June 22, 2004    From Charles Krauthammer's description, it is clear that "Israel's Intifada Victory" is a hollow one.   A war against terrorism is not just a military war. Perhaps the most important aim must be to win the hearts and minds of the enemy. Terrorist organizations need new recruits to operate. But Israel's security policies work against that end by radicalizing the Palestinian population.   Military operations can guarantee long-term security only within the framework of engagement and negotiation. The Palestinian political leadership is rightfully dismissed for not negotiating in good faith. Israel must cultivate and search for leaders it can work with.   Yes, Israel has won this battle, but it will not win the war for its security with its current approach.

      Wilco stand at the edge of attaining real fame. It would be a scary time for any band. Tons of interviews with the press following an album that had a true David-versus-Goliath story and was a critical darling ratchets expectations to almost unbearable levels. Expectations will be high.   And it is in this context that Wilco deliver probably their most challenging album to date. Sure, 2002's  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  was full of random blips and spacy radio noise. Somehow, even in the almost droning "Radio Cures," the shining melodies got through the dense soundscape to almost every ear that listened.    A Ghost Is Born , which is in stores tomorrow, is a different story. For every sweet melody, there is a cacaphonous feedback squall. This dynamic was in full effect at their recent show at the 9:30 Club on June 9. The friendly chord changes of "Handshake Drugs," which appeared on an internet only EP in a slightly different form than it exists on the album, slowly descend into grating, ear-shattering noise. At the 9:30 show, by the end of the song, amid swirling noise, every guitar player had their guitar right next to their amplifier perpetuating the new, more organized, brain-splitting soundscape that defines this album.  There are no shortwave radio SOS calls on this album. Help only comes from the words and the music. According to a press release from Wilco, the goal of the recording process with this album was to record everything live (the least overdubs as possible). That intention comes through the speakers. There seems to be space and definition in the music this time around. In "Hell Is Chrome," a song ostensibly about temptation from the devil, the space between the spare bass notes in the beginning leaves the listener wondering whether the CD has momentarily skipped or stopped.   The openness of the album makes it possible to deal with the dense themes, both lyrical and musical - lack of identity (the birth of the ghost) and emotion through sound (see the sputtering, violent guitar solo attack on the album opener, "At Least That's What You Said").  But Wilco has never forced its listeners to deal exclusively with the dark side of music. After one of the scarier moments on the album, 12 minutes of soft feedback in "Less Than You Think," the jangling guitars and tongue-in-cheek lyrics of "The Late Greats" provide some much needed warmth.  Don't get me wrong. The album has some of the most beautiful, original melodies Wilco has ever played. This time, the band doesn't hide the melodies in density, it hides them in space. And often the space is much more jarring than any radio blip could ever be.  Wilco may be the best band in America right now, but that doesn't mean the world is going to have it easy warming up to them.

      Ch-check it out!   urlLink Wilco’s  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot : Reminiscing on the Eve of their New Album   Excerpt: At points,  YHF  plays out like a sad, delicate old movie, filled with nostalgia and inestimable longing. Those are the films I usually walk out of completely silently, reflecting on the beautifully bruising nature that something so old and so meditative can have. At other times, Tweedy is revealed to be a stunning romantic with an incredible penchant for simple, sweet love tunes. There are simply no notes which he cannot hit with his pen. I find that listening all the way through can leave me exhausted and emotionally drained. The power of the melodies and words is simply unparalleled by anything in my library. In between the “sad sad songs” and “setting suns,” Wilco has touched on something brilliant, clever, heartbreaking, and unforgettable.  CLICK THE LINK TO READ MORE!

      Well at least now we can get a little perspective on the "golden days" of the Clinton presidency. In  urlLink his interview in this week's TIME Magazine , he says he supported - and still supports - the war in Iraq. Sure, he would have liked to have let Hans Blix finish his inspections. That doesn't obscure the fact there were no WMD. Clinton pretty much commits a milder version of the crime that the Bush administration has been committing ever since 9/11 - conflating Al-Qaeda and the war on terror with the war in Iraq. No Mr. Clinton, there were no truly significant connections between Iraq and Al-Qaeda; no Mr. Clinton, Iraq did not have significant WMD to give to terrorists.   Even more disgusting is Clinton's identification with neo-con imperialism. He says, "Well, first of all, I think we needed a little missionary zeal after 9/11." Great, so from that quote it appears as though he also believes that it is America's role to go reshaping the whole world through military operations.  Throughout Bush's presidency progressives have looked back on the halcyon Clinton years drooling with nostalgia. Let's get a little perspective. Instead of Bush's ruthless bullying, with Clinton, we would have had something that could have been called "compassionate aggression."  What a choice!

      I was happy to finally find a  urlLink reasonable hawkish criticism of John Kerry's foreign policy . I usually find David Brooks' criticisms of John Kerry unhelpful and often characteristic of the bumbling soul-searching of many wavering conservative supporters of the war. Today, a neo-con has hit on something that I can't possibly defend. Brooks writes that Kerry thinks a homegrown movement for democracy in Cuba is "unproductive."   If Kerry thinks that, then his foreign policy attitude is unproductive. The alternative to regime change by force is nurturing grassroots movements for democracy. Kerry believes in engagement with the international community. That shouldn't mean that we only deal with the political leaders of a country. Yes, there are times to work with the leaders of a country. But we should not forget the people of a country.   Legitimate and succesful regime change comes when a country's citizens lead a movement for change. It is America's role to enable these movements (of course this is often difficult to do when we need to ensure that the impetus for such a revolution comes from the people and not the U.S.).   Kerry has to have some plan. If we don't use force and we don't engage with peoples struggles, how exactly do we pursue change at all?

      Welcome to the new blog of the one and only member of the band unnoficially dubbed "The Ben Bradlow Experience." I aim to create a journal of a variety of musical, social and political commentary by myself and others. Yes, I may not seem the most tech-savvy, bloggish type. And actually I did not make this page myself. Props to my good friend Eitan "Fuckface" Freedenberg. I realize starting this shit on this server is pretty easy, but what the hell - I got someone to do my work for me. That is always a good thing.  Anyway, a real post should be coming soon.
