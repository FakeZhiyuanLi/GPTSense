          Sent my girlfriend  to the airport this morning. She's going back to Tawau for 2 weeks. Will be  waiting for her to get back. Miss you!         &nbsp;     Saw quite a large  number of people over at A&amp;W for the KVPUG Beamfest. Looks like a great  event. Too bad I couldn't stay. Had some things to do.         &nbsp;     Hopefully  everything will turn out ok. *sigh*

          Finally back in  KL. Driving back halfway, started raining like tornado after Tg Malim. Had to  serve to avoid the flying cows. *dang*         &nbsp;     Anyhow, it's good  to be back!

          Well. Just got  back from lunch with a hefty meal of chicken rice. And what do you know, it's  almost 2pm already. I'm going to  cioa the miao  at exactly 4:50 pm.  Nobody better step in my way or they will get blown to bits. *geared to the  teeth*         &nbsp;

          It's Friday, it's  Friday! By lunch time, I would have no more mood to work already. Have to fill  up the appraisal form and send it back to Lee Lee by today. Need to be back in  the office for the appraisal on Monday. Also need to help out Eugene with  certain training stuff on Monday I guess.         &nbsp;     Had "wan tan mee"  for breakfast at the "tong sui" shop there. Not bad, quite a huge selection of  food there. Many choices and all. Will try to leave by 5pm today.  *woohoo*

          Watching this  Latte at 8 on tv now. Damn, this Jason Lo fella is a funny guy. You guys should  really watch this talk show. It's like on midnight of Thursday and Friday  morning (12 am - 1 am). He had Carsem Soo (the famous Malaysian model) on the  talk show today. *wah* SingleTrackMind (Alex Wong) is on the show as well.  *cool*         &nbsp;     Must seriously  consider watching this I, Robot. Looks like there's some really cool effects in  that show. Probably need to find some time to watch it.  *yeehaw*         &nbsp;     Looks like a  Skype-mania going on recently with the launch of Skype version 1.0. Don't know  what so great about it. This program sucks up your resources like eating  popcorn. Anyhow, if I'm ever online, be sure to add me to your list. My nick is  "ntech18".

          Damn jokers over  at Apple Malaysia. Everything is so expensive. Like they haven't taken enough  money from me with the Powerbook 15 ... now they want your arms, legs and other  internal organs just to buy an iPod at ridiculous price. The idiot who went and  declared the iPod as an "Audio Equipment" with the Malaysian customs should be  shot, stabbed, burnt, poked, stepped on and thrown into a pit of snakes. Now we  all have to pay tax on the stupid iPod. *grumble grumble*         &nbsp;     Just heard that  Jack is organizing a meet-up with the Baan boy :P. Hey Jack, never ask me to  come along arr... *tsk tsk*. I tumpang a ride from you and go together ler  :)         &nbsp;     Time to launch  Kazaa and start a download fest ...  *muahahahaha*

         Terrible blokes over in the office. Takes forever to clear claims and salary. It's already 29th of July and the money is not even in the account yet ... *grrrr*           What's there to approve. This is like a monthly ritual right. Just clear the damn cheque and give me the cash already. *grind teeth in fury*           Had a nice breakfast and now back to work. Nothing much exciting in the e-mails nowadays. I wonder if the spam filters have anything to do with it. *hmm*           Now to move on to important task ... like checking KVPUG and MYMUG forums. Will post up later updates when I find them. By the way, for those who needs the latest traffic report, don't forget to check  urlLink http://www.kvpug.org/traffic.cfm .

          Still stuck in  CARSEM. Damn sleepy and hungry. What to do? What to do?         &nbsp;     Maybe I should  play sending e-mails out to my hate list. Start a post-fest in KVPUG and MYMUG.  Just remember that this Saturday got KVPUG beamfest, MYMUG gathering and PC Fair  all at the same time. So many things to do and so little  time.         &nbsp;     *sigh*         &nbsp;

            Well, up to Ipoh  once again. Good thing I've decided to take a slow drive up travelling at 90-100  km/h. There usual speed trap is at it again. They were trapping people near the  90km/h limit (the hilly area). Terrible blokes. At least I saw Insp. Ibrahim  there and gave him a friendly gesture :)         &nbsp;     CARSEM, CARSEM,  CARSEM... *sigh*... getting tired of this place.         &nbsp;     Oh well.. back to  work.

          Well. It's  officially Wednesday. This means one more day before returning to KL. Got a call  from the Alpha Romeo sales-person. He mentioned that someone has booked my car  (the Silver color Alfa 147) ... *the bastard*         &nbsp;     Anyhow, in order  to get the color, I need to undercut that person by getting the loan approved  first. If his/her loan gets approved first then the car will be lost. If that's  the case, I told him not to give me any other color. I would get the Honda Jazz  instead. That car would be my secondary choice ... *yummy*         &nbsp;     We'll just have to  wait and see how thing goes ... *patience*       &nbsp;

          Bought some  chewing and bubble gums from a shop in 1 Utama a few days ago. Wow! They are  fantastic. Love 'em.         &nbsp;     Didn't bring my  model car up. Feeling so bored in the house. Maybe I'll just enjoy watching tv  :)         &nbsp;     Got a presentation  later in the afternoon from 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm. Looks like I will ened to find a  bullet proof vest before stepping in to the room. Maybe I can loan a tank from a  nearby army bunker *evil laughter*         &nbsp;

          Ok ler. Back in Ipoh again. Didn't bring my car model kit up. Was raining  in the morning and I didn't want my model to get wet.  *shucks*         &nbsp;                  Latest update I got from Pankaj (currently still  in&nbsp;Shanghai)&nbsp;is he's going back to India on the 13th August 2004 and  picking up his visa on the 16th August 2004. This means he would be back in KL a  few days after that. Have a safe trip buddy. Looks like he's having fun over  there. Waiting for your photos :)           &nbsp;     Got confirmation  on the iPod. I can get a rebate of RM 760 on the new iPod (4th generation). This  means I only need to pay RM 739 for the new 20GB iPod (original price is RM  1499). Still damn expensive if you ask me but dang ... it's an iPod. Love those  machines. Don't think I can afford it though. So if anyone is interested in  buying the rebate from me, I can sell to you for RM 300 :)         &nbsp;

          Well. My grandfather  passed away on the 4th August 2004 at about 3pm. Tried to rush back from Ipoh  but couldn't make it in time. *sigh*         &nbsp;     Will be moving out  to the crematorium on Friday at around 2pm and then to Nirvana. Would probably  not be blogging for the next few days.         &nbsp;

          Doctor tried to  find a vein to do the drip needle but couldn't find one using the x-ray machine.  Now resorting to plan B which is to use a feeding tube down the nose. This way,  we still can feed him with vitamins and water and hopefully he can remove the  urea content. *worried*         &nbsp;

          Back in CARSEM  once again. Still worried about my grandfather's condition.         &nbsp;     Reported some  Material Issue - Additional Request, IQA and Cost Block Template issues at  CARSEM. Let's get it all completed so we can get them out of sight. Not to  mention that the autopack setup customization will start next week.  *ARGH!*         &nbsp;     Going to see if I  can find some nice Winamp Moderm skins .... *yummy*         &nbsp;

           Well. Gone  for appraisal and survived it. Someone sent me an SMS telling me Steve Jobs has  gone for an operation for cancer (but he's fine). The news is here:    http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,39162359,00.htm           &nbsp;     Now just wait for  time to go back.

          Finally got back  to the office. Life is getting so boring at Ipoh. There's suppose to be an  appraisal happening today (don't know when though). Let's see how it  goes.         &nbsp;     There were two new  developer in the office today. Both of them are into Axapta. Heh...  *suckers*         &nbsp;     Don't know when I  need to go up to Ipoh again. Probably need to follow Pei Hsien since I'm  preparing to sell my current car.         &nbsp;     Grandfather in the  hospital. Looks like pretty bad condition. *having lots of faith* I hope he can  pull through this challenge like what he did many imes before. *sad  sad*         &nbsp;     Cynthia (my  girlfriend) is back in Tawau. Hi there! Guess she must be having a great time  :)         &nbsp;

         Yippeekayee! The salary is finally in the account. Damn buggers take so long to get the salary approved. Oh shit. That reminds me. I have to get my claims up and ready as well. Shit! Back to work on the claims.    PC Fair last day today. Must be like &#8220;pasar malam&#8221; there.    Went for a really nice lunch (and cheap as well) over at Sri Kembangan. Nice place to eat. Must go back for more next time. * woohoo *    OK. More later.
