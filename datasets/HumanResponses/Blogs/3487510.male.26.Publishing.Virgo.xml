      Jesus Christ!!! I have never seen such wonderful things done with pieces of fruit and ping pong balls.Our night out in Pat Pong was hilarious, we arrived with three of our Thai freinds who said they new the best spots.  We made our way to a very dark and dogy looking bar to be welcomed by about ten near naked(not that nice looking)birds prancing around a stage surrounded by a bar. After ten minutes the show started with two ladies opening big bottles of soda water with there vaginas, this created a massive champagne popping sound and looked quite painful but hilarious. After this we were treated with many other great shows but possibly the best hightlights were one very big built ladie shooting half a banana from 10 feet away at my head very narrowly missing me, and Ben pulling loads and loads of streamers from a ladies pussy.  After this very entertaining show we went to a bar full of ladie boys, it was surprisingly hard to spot some of them as they were very slim with huges boobs, we met a guy from essex who was very pissed and excited at the prospect of spending the night with one of them for a huge cost of about a fiver uuuuurrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!  Anyway better go, another update on its way soon.

      Hey there People, just a quick note to say thanks for checking this out, and sorry for not a lot of info being on here yet.At the mo I am sat in a Bangkok guest house while young Mr Mitchell is upstairs with his beautiful Thai lady called Lamyai!!  Last night was another typical night in Bangkok with lots of whisky being sank, me and Ben starting the night by saying "right we'll have an early one tonight" and ending up stagering home at 4 or 5 in the morning and then smoking ourselves into oblivion "I love it". Both me and Ben were a bit fragile due to me having another tattoo on my back yeaterday which bloody hurt as some of it is right on my spine, and Ben being pretty ill with a busted toe nail, and a few other things that ill let him tell you about.  So only got a few more days but got a lot to do, tonight im going to Pat Pong which where there are some mad sex shows involving bananas,ping pong balls and razor blades, watch this space as ill try and get some pics!!After tonight if we survive we are going to a massive market tomorrow to try and pick up loads of fake nikes,rolexs,DVD's and other mad stuff then of to a massive Thai boxing match tomorrow night.  Right for those who are still awake ill love you and leave you and update you again soon.

      Hello there readers, I hope you are all good and enjoying this beautifal english summer!!!Not Me and Benny are very well. Ben is sub teaching in cheltenham and loving it, apart from the avarage of 14 rubbers,16 rulers a pair of scissors and a hammer being thrown at him everyday. I am working for a publishing company and also lovin it, at first it was all very new and I was a bit unsure but it seems to be alot easier than selling cars and alot more organised.  Over the last few weeks, we have had lots more drunken shenanigans both in Gloucester and away. My highlight is probably Glastonbury which was basically five days of trying to eat as little as possible but trying to drink (cider)as much as possible(photos are on there way)The highlight for me was a band called lamb (www.lambstar.net) also the great Paul Mccartney was wicked.  As some of you maybe aware, Me,Wyn and Matt are running the London marathon if they let us in. Any support or advise would be great apart from the usual "Ha yeah right you three run the marathon" and "Do you know how long it is, youll never make it" This web site will be holding bets on the event including who will be first out of the three of us, if well make it to the end and of course who well  be dressing up as, the odds on favourites are lady boys and burberry gloucester chavs!!!  Anyway gotta go, any requests for anything let me know and if anyones got any wicked jokes worth putting on send them to me!!
