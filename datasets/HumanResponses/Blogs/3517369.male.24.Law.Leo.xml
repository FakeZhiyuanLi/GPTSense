      Check out this news story by clicking on the title of this post.  It is exactly why I want to be a lawyer, so that I can be a loved and treasured member of society.    So.  I say Fes is based on Willy Wonka.  All that Good day, I said good day and candy obsession is proof enough for me.  I dont care if stinky Jessie agrees with me or not.  Fes is Willy Wonka, spread the word.

      I am so smart.  S - M - R - T.  I mean S - M - A - R - T.  La la la la.    Damn this sucks.  I am so bored.  And I really dont want to go to this stupid motorcycle training course tonight all the way out in Queens.  That is going to totally kill my weekend.  Crap.    Looks like I am going to have to do work now, because otherwise I am going to get nothing done before I have to go to this stupid class.  And yes, it is a good thing that I did not go to math school.

      Lori had her note published today.  It is quite exciting.  I have a personally autographed copy.  Even though she defines attorney in her condensed note, she does no such thing in her student note.  It is very impressive.  She even wished me best wishes today.  And that coming from Lori, it means something.    Yael got All the Best from Lori.  I think best wishes are better because I wish for things that are better then the best.  They are the bestest.  That is what I am so special.  Special like a fox.    Ok, must go do the advanced evidence and crim questions.  Those are going to be tough.  Tough with a capital T.  Like for trouble but tough instead.  Ok, off to the questions.

      So Jessie wants in my blog.  Here you go Jessie.  Tell the small handed german that you are now in itnernet fame.    I have gotten no work done this week, and I will probably not get any work done until tomorrow.  Busy busy week.  It is killing me.  I am so tired I dont know what to do.    Con law is over, and I dont think I retained a thing.  I am going to have to go back over my notes in detail because I think it all went in one ear and out the other ear.    Oh well.  I am going to do a bit of work and then I am off to this benefit at the Museum of Natural History with the boyfriend.  Should be fun, but I am sooooo tired.  I'll make sure I make it through though.

      The day after the summer benefit for VLA.  I went out last night and had a bit too much to drink.  I missed the morning sessiona nd I am going to the afternoon session instead.  My head hurts.  Oh well.  That is all  I have to say for now.

      So I am bored on a Saturday.  I should be working, doing all those practice questions I have been putting off until today, but I just dont want to.  My head hurts and I am tired.  I need to just get out of the house and go to the coffee shop and sit down and just do my f---ing work.  Boyfriend is back.  It is great to see him.  But since he came back a few weeks ago for the first time, things have seemed different.  I wonder if it is the bar exam that is changing things.  I cant imagine how, just that I know it makes everything more complicated.  At least that is what I have heard.   Ok, one T.V. show off TiVo and then off to the coffee shop to do some practice questions.

      So I wasted most of my day after class today at VLA.  I just dont want to do work.  I have to though and I know that.  The boyfriend comes back tomorrow morning and I will get to see him for around 20 minutes before I have to leave to go to class.    Class today was awful;  3+ hours of an essay writing workshop. The tips were highly useful but it just dragged on much longer than necessary.  I just wish these lecturers would cut to the chase and stop with all the bull shit.  Ah well.    Ok, I am going up to the boyfriends house now.  Will do my work there ... hopefully.

      Lori thinks she needs to include the definition of attorney in her condensed notes.  I think if she needs to define attorney as someone who passes the bar, she is a crazy crazy crazy.    I have to finish condensing my Evidence notes.  It sucks.  That will be a common theme here.  Sucking.  And not the good kind of sucking.  I wont be getting any of that either.    Anyways.  I am going to go condense.  I did get my laundry done last night.  That is good.  But then I was a poop today in class.  Fell asleep a bit.  Oh well.  I will go do my work.  And then more.  And then more.  The life of the bar exam.  Hurah.

      Not entirely sure what to write.  I have tons of work to be doing and all I want to do is sit and eat pizza and watch TV.  I have essays to write and lessons to listen to, but all I want is to stuff my face and sit on the couch.  I guess that is nothing new though.    It is only 5 days in and already I am felling burned out.  Even after a weekend of recuperating I want to go to bed.  My boyfriend is gone and all I want to sleep with him for around 200 hours and not get out of bed.  That would be nice.  Oh well.  Looks like I am just going to have to get to work.    I will put my laundry in and then just write those evidence essays.  I hope this is what a blog looks like.  We shall see.
