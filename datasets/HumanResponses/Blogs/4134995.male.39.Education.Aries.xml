						   Felt like crap this morning, the thought crossed my mind on the way to work that it might me nice to wake up dead one day then I could get some rest ah well it will have later rather than sooner I hope {had some close calls tell you about them later}  They were meant to be pouring the concrete today at the school but as it was raining they did not.  When I got home I found to my dismay that the scanner did not work, and then I found out that the roof was leaking!  I have been stuck on the Service Rifle exam because of the defective scanner, so up loaded updated web pages to the 18 bn web site, I think the scanners power supply has gone on the blink its a HP scanjet 3200C about 5 years old.  Why do I feel so fucking tired?

						   Tuesday light rain today, no dramas at the school today but I was glad to get home. Got into my sleeping clothes real early. Was working on the service rifle exam and instructions for same and the dragon kept coming in the room and talking to me constantly breaking my train of thought. Long experience has taught me to listen to what she has to say and show that I am listening by ceasing all other activity. She was bringing me cups of tea, which was really sweet of her, and I enjoyed but I wanted to get something done before The Bill came on. She let me know when The Bill was coming on so I ceased typing and ensconced myself on the lounge 10 minutes into the show she starts vacuuming!  Some days I feel that she will not kill me but intends to drive me insane. Because she was going to work tonight I was able to get some of the service rifle exam and instructions for same completed. I did need the current Standard Shooting Rules so down loaded them from the NRAA web site but found that Adobe Acrobat reader was something that I had neglected to re install so I had to down load that as well took over an hour!  I also intend to scan and OCR convert the Fullbore Range & Butts officers exam and this with the SSR’s and a bit of cut and past magic will provide me with what I require.  I have also updated the NSDRAI OPM flyers so that task is complete though I must check with Max Johnson to see if he got some sponsorship so as I can put it on the major flyers.  Time for bed

						   Its been raining! Sandra my principal was meant to have come back today but has not I miss her something shocking. Cut up some timber of IA no cars are allowed to park in the front, as the cement for the building is being poured NOT they are just doing the form work!  The dragon rang and said that here was something wrong with the computer I asked “what?” she replied, “won’t go”  Doug Bowen rang about running a course for the RANR RC He was quite put out that I could not do one ASAP have agreed to do the theory part at Malabar on 4th September and the practical on November 21st at Hornsby I have suggested that they should send other members of their club to Hornsby to ensure that there are enough details to run the candidates through.   The computer has a dead motherboard, CPU and hardrive ! $350.00 to repair this It was fixed by 8pm   Arthur Johnson rang about running a course for the RANR RC he says that they are unsafe I will find this out. I intend to write a theory exam for them to do.  I have to write the exam, type up the 18bn minutes, download the DSR funding doc copy and distribute, complete the annual return for Firearms Registry, type up and copy the flyer for the NSDRAI OPM & create and mail out the 18bn newsletter.   All this in my spare time! What spare time? I still have to do my reloading for the NSW Championships.  Hobbies are meant to provide relaxation?

						   Ok what happened? Well went to the range on Saturday and as it was so windy the distance was changed from 700m to 300m started off running the butts, then when I was relieved went and continued creosoting the frames of the clubhouse.  When I returned the dragon was in one of her strange moods and made life uncomfortable for me as I suggested that we get Asian food and she had to wait for 45 min before it was ready meanwhile I had let the rice noodles that were cooking on our stove turn into mush. I did not do this intentionally, watched the Bill and The Way We Were {and should be again it just needs a strong leader to take over the Government and remove those who are destroying our culture} and by that time the dragon had calmed down so we went to bed.   Up early on Sunday as we are digging the trench for the electrical services for the clubhouse. I was in such a confused state that I did not take my shooting coat lunch & thermos! There were only 7 competitors for the service match I can remember the days when we used to get about 30 that was before the Self Loaders were taken away, I came first in “B” grade and 3rd overall, helped run the cable through the conduit and back fill the trench.   Went to Coles at Asquith where I was served by an attractive girl called Emma who appeared to be about 15 and pregnant, It has been some time since I have found myself aroused by beauty in a woman and it's a feeling that I don’t find particularly useful. {It is a hook that sometimes you cannot free yourself from} Her beauty was not that of film stars of other women that the Media deem attractive but she had a definite “IT” factor about her. If I had met her in a Brothel in my younger days I would have been spending my money on her as to learn more about her.   The dragon works tonight and I also have an early start as I am permitted by Sydney Water to water the playing fields from 0600 to 0900 and 1700 to 2000. I am not staying that late at school my hours are meant to be between 0600 and 1700 8 hours per day though I normally work 0700 to 1545 I start at 0530 on Monday in a forlorn attempt to save the playing fields but the children are destroying the grass by walking on it. At this stage the grass has turned yellow and is being broken off by children walking and playing on it. Sigh

						   That’s what today is  BLACK FRIDAY  obvious I know but I have been told I have a habit of stating it!  As with most Fridays I feel washed out I wonder is it age or something else?  I don’t want to be an American; I like being who I am.  The dragons vehicle has defective headlights, "sigh" another bloody thing to fix luckily I had a set of spare bulbs but to change the bulbs you have to remove the grille, doing this by the light of a torch outside whilst cars wizz by at speeds in excess of 80 kph { the speed limit in my street is 50}The dragon was greatfull that I had repaired the lights but not that greatfull {still can't get her to wear the french maid uniform }  Yesterday I received registration Certificates from Firearms Registry I have been only waiting since 1998 for these!  I just hope the application for a Commissioners Permit comes before October the 3rd that’s the date when it is needed so the last day for arrival is October 1st. the last postal date. Not holding my breath.  So damm tired so I had better go to bed early.

						   Thursday night.  The Dragon in a strange mood when I got home because she has to work tonight, She winds herself up until she is in a bad mood then goes to work, leaving me at home to do this, not that she knows of this Blog and indeed I am pleased that no one looks at it.  Some things are best left alone and the extent of my thoughts disturbs me sometimes.  Went for my $20.00 massage at the TAFE tonight. The Dragon came as well because she got a free one. we went in her truck and her anger manifested itself in her driving.  She has made a delicious chicken soup for tea tonight .  I want to stop working at the school soon, as I cannot live on $412.50 a week I can exist  "But I   want to live!"  I have put my resume on the internet but to no avail, I guess people don't want a Workhorse printer.  If I got another $100.00 a week at the school it would be good but their is no way that I am going to get that.  My game plan to get a new Job is to write to my local MPs. At the State level it is John Watkins and at the Federal level John Howard, and ask them to find me a job. A Current Affair & Today Tonight will be very interested if they cannot cannot get me one.

						   Well went to the meeting and ran for President. Simon Barnhoorn had apparently taken his nomination to Jan by hand on the day the nominations closed. As I had hoped I was approached prior to the meeting and was offered to position of Vice President if I was unsuccessful in my bid as President, which I was.  I was elected unopposed As Vice President. I did not see the written nominations so I am unsure if Simon had filled them out correctly but to ask to see them would be petty and churlish in my opinion and would make me look if I was a poor looser.  My goal was the Vice Presidency and that I have achieved. The Dragon is pleased with this, as she believes that I have too much work as it is.  I ruminate that Adolf Hitler started as Vice President (Chancellor actually)  My objective as Vice President is to facilitate the organization of and application for funding from the Department of Sport and Recreation under their Grants for sporting bodies assistance scheme.  You can imagine my dismay when I saw the fractionalised disciplines and heard the negative comments from some of the members of the committee.  It is much easier to whinge than to do something!  “ I ask what is to be done did you give me an answer NO only complaints, I ask for a solution did you give me one? NO so I will give you mine.”  Max Bolton is now the Hon Secretary only time will tell what will happen with that but I feel that it could possibly be a negative step as Max is not on the E-Mail and his time is taken up with the Smallbore &amp; Pistol Clubs + the Bushfire brigade.

						   I have just read of the death of Fay Wray, at the grand old age of 96.  I feel low as to this and reflect on the concept that perhaps there is one thing in this life that each of us must do to make our mark.  All sing: What ever happened to Fay Wray, her delicate satin drenched frame that clung to her thigh I started to sigh cause I wanted to be dressed just the same....

						   Well went to the trophy shop on Saturday ordered the trophys for the yearly presentation. Was butts officer for some time then went to the Clubhouse and started to creosote the studs and bearers in the wall was stopped by bad light. got some dog sausage and went home.   watched the Bill and drank a bottle of Bulls Blood whilst watching RAGE it was all stuff from my youth The 80s. I didn't know what a good time I was having only when I look back I realise that I wasted my youth waiting for the good time to come but what happened was as good as it got. I get pissed off as I was lied to by the media and did not have the whirlwind of sex and alcohol I mean I knew lots of sluts but I was a hopeless romantic and believed in all that BS.  If I knew what I know now man I would be the most evil and depraved creature on the planet! those skanky moles would not stand a chance I would be destroying them I want to be the one that they remember not the "he's a nice guy but..." that I was then.  I realy dislike teenage girls I belive that in the main they are only good for commiting acts of perversion on and you know why BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT!  Little prick teasing Sluts. I once asked one to go out with me and she said "I wouldn't go out with you if you were the last guy on earth, why don't you Fuck off and drop dead" evil bitch that legs kabuki Linda my sister called her the "Sluterous the Sluterous" I am partly to blame as I was quite enamoured of her and of course moles if they have been abused by men before will strike first it's a natural instinct.  Haley Spinks was different there was a line in a song at the time "rolly polley little bad faced girl" that I feel applies to her she was very good she used to get one guy at the start of the night then one in the middle and at the end of the night get them together and watch them fight over her as she walked away with another guy she had her eye on all night a real smooth operator was Haley. she came from the Gold Coast and lived in a street called green tree leaf close I think it was called. The street did exist because I drove along it one time I went to Queensland was that place a crock of shit the things they tell you about it "SUNNY PETROL CHEAP FRIENDLY WOMEN" all BS it was raining petrol was cheaper in NSW and no women spoke to me mate I've got the photos to prove it. Foreign food, films, cars and places are all best left to foreigners.  I am really excited about about the Clubhouse the roof and doors go on on monday we have to organise Perto to gyprock the internal walls after I have finshed creosoting the studs and bearers in the wall and Dave Rodgers has wired it up.  Sunday I started to sort out the paperwork mess that I inherited and went over to see Mum & Dad. The Dragon and I went down the Club for tea, I suppose that why I am so angry about the teenage girls as this was a place of my youth for the discos and the memories keep comming back of the young pieces of flesh who destroyed my world of romance and indirectly are responsible for the person I am today. (the Dragon seems to think that my friendship with Zombie may have somthing to do with it as well, gee I miss him)   Got  to go to bed now as I have to go to work in the morning. The dragon is at work now till 6am she works really hard stacking those shelves, I do love her perhaps one day I will understand her?

						   He was there again this morning so I stopped and took him across the road.  I finished off the assets register for D block today only A B E F&amp; G to go!  Had chinese food for tea cost $10.80 I had to pay the 80cents out of my own money! I give the Dragon $200.00 a week for housekeeping.  Tomorrow I will see what progress has been made on the Clubhouse I'm quite excited about seeing that.  When the Clubhouse is finished I Intend to start looking for a bettter paid job, got my name down on that SEEK website since February but I have had no interest it's another big con.  It pisses me off how the world is just one big con if you are a white male this is not the world for you these days.  Todays paper had in it that Muslims felt sterotyped DERRR live with it. so are Jews, Gays, Gun owners, Readnecks and National Socialists  WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE WANT?  "The destiny of the human race is to widen the gap separating it from the lower races of animals. Any code of morality which retains its permanence and authority after the conditions of existence which gave rise to it have changed, works against this upward progress of man."

						   The Dragon got upset last night for no appreciable reason, Perto had sent email which included pictures of swimming costumed women.  The Dragon sees this as an insult to the fact that she is getting old it realy is her problem, she made noise about what his agenda was.  My explanation is that blokes send those sort of pictures to each other to re affirm the fact that they are not Homosexual this she rejected and sees it as some sort of conspircy to make her old.  Its a sad fact that pictures of swimming costumed women don't do any thing for me thse days.  I love the Dragon dearly but I find her irrational outbursts upsetting, I am finding it hard to get into a romantic mood when I am confronted with a shreiking harpy.  My main interests in life these days are food, sleep and rifle marksmanship There is no doubt that the Dragon cares for me this is despite that fact that she says that she is "Just with me until something better comes along"  Perhaps I am in denial myself?

						   Today on  my way to work I came a cross a Chuiaua, it was on the side of the road nearest the Cemetery and wanted to cross. Putting its front paws in the gutter and taking them out again when the cars came by. I stopped and picked him up and took him over the road and put him on the other side he went YIP YIP YIP and ran off into a yard.  This has been my good deed for the day I am surprised with the extent of my feelings for this.

						   I don't realy know if anyone reads this and I don't realy care.  the way I feel about my treatment by the managment of NORCROSS when I applied for the position of afternoon shift supervisor and was rejected and I then asked as to why and was told "you are not much chop as a printer and not worth feeding and if I had my way I would have sacked you years ago" does not constitute in my book as a legitimate excuse. Even though this happened in 1998 I would like an answer  " With Knowledge comes Understanding, With Undertanding comes Acceptance "   I no longer work for NORCROSS as Of 21st JUNE 2001 the printing section was closed down and I with many others was made redundant It was the JEWS from Melbourne who have ripped my life apart.  I applied to enter University and was told the I could not as there were no places for me, I was willing to pay! Cant pay now as I have spent the money living.  No places for me they were probably taken by ASIAN STUDENTS ! those illegals who have ruined my life with the multicultural crap.  Bloody do gooders they will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes.  As a consquence of this I am now forced to exist on $412.50 a week this is to support my family!   Have you notice that there are not many Austalian schoolgirls about? there are many ASIAN Sucky sucky f..y f..y and other nationalities but not many AUSSIES not like it was when I was going to school there were plenty of young Aussie Sluts not that they would suck my cock or let alone fuck me bloody moles evil bitches. The dumb Aussie moles that are present are busy having sex with Wog boys who treat them like the sex toys they are (lucky bastards). I have heard with my own ears a 15 year old Aussie girl announce that " Nobody can fuck me like a LEB can" Filling them up with spoontter then the little moles get up the stick and I am forced to support ANOTHER UNMARRIED MOTHER! I get all the responsibility and none of the fun the Government should organse so the the taxpayers can have sex with these little sluts. You know pull their panties aside and stick your dick in their arse and then I will think that Iam getting value for money. BG  We ought to permanantly spay moles who do this and if they get up the stck have them scraped and flushed  Guess what ZMNN stands for?  PS If you agree/disagree with any of this I would be very interested to hear your comments
