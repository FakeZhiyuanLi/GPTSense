      So today I was looking through the  urlLink G4TechTv  website, for those of you that dont know G4 is a game channel on Comcast digital cable and according to ratings is not very viewed, and Tech Tv is a tech channel on Directv which is very viewed, well they are combining into G4Techtv and taking a few shows form each to show, now looking through the site I see that Call for Help ( one of the best shows on techtv) is not being ported over...yet some of the shows that absolutly noone watches on G4 are being ported over... Somehow I don't think I am going to like this switch >  /Kevin

      So, This is my first blog post here. I don't have much to say right now..  I'll post more once I have more to say.  In parting I will leave you with this quote: "Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods." -- Confucius  /Kevin

       urlLink iBeeZz  seems cool.. havent fully tested it yet.. it will automate pretty much anything on your computer.. opens apps,files, mail, puts computer to sleep, wakes it up, turns it off, turns it on, and best of all i can set it so i can fall asleep to music, it will then turn the music off at a preset time and then fall asleep....then it will also wake itself up and play more music to wake me up...ill post more on it once itest it fully

      Today was the last day for Patrick Nortan on "The Screen Savers" they say he might do a few guest appearences later after they move the show to LA ( god damn comcast...retards) this is still a sad say as Pat was the best host on Tech Tv.

      I should have wrote these a few days ago but I don't know where my mind has been lately.. well i sorta do but i wont mention it. Anyway, Pod2go automaticly syncs your ipod with pretty much anything, weather, sports, movie times, anything. and calandarclock puts an iCal calandar in a click menu with your clock. Both are small applications but very very usful.  until next time.

      This is where I SHOULD be praising  urlLink iPod Linux ...BUT I missed the post where it says my 4g iPod isn't supported, so I spent 5 hours trying the terminal way and 2 GUI installers multiple times for well nothing. But I will praise it once it works on 4g!!
