         Mixed messages are friendship killers For example, let’s say you are as fortunate as I am and have a wonderful friend named Kate. Our relationship is strong, but not strong enough to survive an “I like you why can’t you like me” attack. I guess the easiest place. to start would be at the beginning. The beginning of my friendship with a small freshman girl named Kate…the true beginning of my journey to understand what love truly is.                        September 3 rd   2003 : Was an interesting day for me to say the least. Not only was it the first day of school, it was also the first time I had gone since May not talking to my girlfriend Catherine. The day was pretty uneventful as far as first days go until I got to my last period class of the day. French was never my strong subject, and the year before this, I didn’t pass as well as my father would have liked me too. So here I am in a room with a bunch of freshmen. If you are upperclassmen you can relate to how incredible annoying some of them can be. I took my seat towards the back of the class razing my head to the few kids I did actually know, and stared longingly outside waiting for a flash of yellow bus. Then something hit me…quite literally...I felt an odd sensation on my right eyes…as I rubbed it with a smooth force I looked around for the object that had struck me. As I reached down to pick up the pen I looked around for someone who might has accidentally through it across the room.                When I looked up, the sight startled me…there seated directly across from me was one of the prettiest girls I have ever seen in my school. Now, before any of you in my school, or anyone who has seen her picture argue with me on this, let me explain. If you notice, I said “pretty” not “hot” not “banging” not “smoking” or anything of that sort, not that she isn’t to me, but just to get us on the same page of what I thought when I first looked into her emerald green eyes. No I said pretty for a reason, the reason being I could see there was something different about her…something in her soul if you will. Anyway as I handed the pen back to her I noticed she was holding a rubber band in her hand and was pretty much aiming for my head. Confused, I asked her what she was doing. “Oh….um…sorry…you looked so… bored.”    I tilted my head in disbelief that a girl who I hardly knew was flinging pens near my head and hitting my eye. “Well…ok…could you stop…that one hit my eye…” I replied to her in a very calm and passive aggressive tone. “Oh yea, sure” she said. I placed the pen back on her desk and continued my stare into nothingness expecting the conversation and my life’s intertwining with hers to end. It didn’t.                “Hi” she said in a cute voice. “I'm Kate” I slowly turned my head to look her in the eyes when I caught a glimpse of her smile…I have been addicted to it ever since…”hi, um…..I’m Malcolm” she looked at me curiously and laughed…another thing I am presently addicted to. “That’s a cool name” she said, hinting at sarcasm. I nodded my head with a fake smile and tried to go back to being alone. She made sure I wasn’t. “so what’s up?” She asked me. It was at this point I was going to say something stupid to her and ruin my chances of ever speaking to her again…but instead I said something reasonably intelligent. Nothing much…you? Ok so I’m no Casanova…shut up I’m not an expert at speaking to girls. I bit my lip and turned my head right after I said that. She laughed and simply said nothing the rest of the class our eyes casually met back and forth. After the bell rang and a bus showed up…and for the first time …I actually didn’t want to leave school. And when I got home…I completely forgot about my girlfriend. And when she did call, all she did was yell at me for not calling. If you’ve ever seen office space, the one seen when he gets hypnotized and the doctor dies before he snaps his fingers, the way he acted after that is how I was…I had no cares in the world…I had a permanent smile….if you pricked me I wouldn’t have felt the pain, I was too involved in her…ladies and gentlemen…I was in love.                                       The next at school was magical for me. I ignored all my classes, I was waiting for French. And apparently so was she. The minute she saw me, her face lit up and she hugged me. Good god I almost melted. The entire French class we spent talking to each other. My teacher didn’t speak much English so it didn’t matter, but oh my god was it fun. I got to a part were I told her how I was moving into a house on lower reservoir rd. she almost screamed. I know that house! We go by it everyday on the bus! My heart skipped a beat. You mean…your going to be my neighbor? Sweet Jesus, I was ecstatic. Yes my friends things with Kate were on the rise…but everything that goes up…must come down. If you remember, I had a girlfriend named Catherine who did nothing but yell at me and get mad. Kate was the complete opposite of her and I was starting to fall for her. Catherine was not pleased with this at all. In fact on several, occasions she threatened to kill Kate. And eventually she got me to hate Kate, which wasn’t fair because Kate was and is the best thing to ever happen to me. After Catherine tried braking up with me over Kate, my friendship with her faded, she became another face in the halls, just another pretty girl, and I always thought she would be the one who got away.                Depression set in. All my life, I really never had a “best friend”.    I’ve had best  friends  (Kevin, Tyler, Tim, Mike…to name a few.), but that’s not the same as having one friend who above all else, will always be there for you, regardless of anything someone who would wait for you, who would cry for you, who would hope for you, who would long for you, who would live for you…someone who would die for you. Kate was that person to me for a long time before Catherine put an end to it. Things with Catherine weren’t going well at this point anyway, she was always insisting I spend all my time with her and not my friends, that I should spend all my money on her and not on my self, Basically things that someone who tells you they love you shouldn’t do. I began questioning my love for Catherine when I met Kate, and by mid October, my love for her was gone. Here I was, all alone for the most part. I always had my guy friends, but nothing to fill the void I had been attached to. I didn’t think Kate would even speak to me after the way I treated her, and I even considered going back to Catherine, but something inside me stopped me. Something told me to trust my self and my feelings for Kate. One day in French, I said hi…and she looked at me with her big, beautiful green eyes, said hi back and smiled. We went on talking like nothing had ever happened. For the first time since September, I felt whole.               I believe its Murphy’s Law that states, “what ever can go wrong, will go wrong” which pretty much described my relationship with Kate for the next few months. As you may recall, I had strong feelings for her…and she had the same feelings for me. But a series of unfortunate events prevented us from truly hitting it off. First, Catherine kept bugging the fuck out of me and called Kate crying about me. Kate is a very good person, so of course she sat and listed to her and understood, and re-assured her nothing was going to happen between us. That pissed me off. Here I have this incredible girl who is totally into me…and I can’t make a move on her because my fucking ex has to go and be a bitch! I waited what I thought was a long enough time before bringing up the subject of dating to Kate. Well folks, I never was one for timing, but I wasn’t counting on Kate having a boyfriend. Who nelson if that didn’t put me off course just a smidge…I almost did a double take on that one. Anyway, because I loved this girl as a friend so frikin much, I forced a smile and was happy for her. I went home that night and called Catherine.                               By the time December rolled around, I was stuck in a deadlock between Kate and Catherine. I was praying for divine intervention. Not to help me pick the right one mind you, I was pretty certain Kate was it. No, I needed an excuse to get rid of Catherine.       The first thing that happened was by chance; Catherine met one of her old boyfriends at the mall and kissed him. STRIKE ONE. By this time I pretty much told her either accept Kate or go die, so she wasn’t saying anything to bad, until my birthday rolled around. Kate got me counter-strike for the Xbox…and if you’re not a geek and you have a life, and don’t know what “counter –strike” or an “Xbox” is, it’s a very cool videogame that I told her to get me. I was thrilled. I was absolutely thrilled. I still have the card she gave me…and every now and then when I can’t see her, I read it and smile.       Catherine also got it for me. She gave it to me expecting a huge thank you. But what she got was. “No, Kate already got that for me…thanks though” she was pissed off to say the least. And I don’t blame her...that was a pretty hardcore thing I said. No, what really got my panties in a bunch was when she screamed “I hope you and your stupid little whore die and go to hell” at the top of her lungs. Yea, that’s going to lose you points missy. STRIKE TWO. The final strike came when she decided it would be ok if she played god with my life. Her exact words… “Don’t hang out with Kevin and Tyler, I don’t like them. “Don’t talk to Kate, I don’t like her”….my exact words…”Catherine…go get hit by a bus” that was pretty much the last thing I said to her.                       Now I was free…free at last to pursue my relationship with Kate. Ahhhh, it was great,       Our first kiss was spectacular, our first date was incredible and…wait…that’s all that happened…why? Well after all of that…after everything I went through…Malcolm and Kate…the couple everyone thought would last for ever… lasted for a grand total of….wait for it….. 11 days. No, that’s not a typo. 11 days, The number after 10. Eleven days. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ELEVEN. After this sudden and shocking change of events occurred, I was forced in a very harsh way to ask why. Why after all we’ve been through together, all the smiles we’ve shared and the tears we’ve cried together, Why did you play with my emotions like that? Her answer…her answer…is one of the several reasons why I am homicidal. “Well…I really like your friend Kevin” I seriously considered suicide at this point. I wasn’t going to actually do it, but I was thinking it. Now this next part is in quotes, but its not something I actually said to her…no this is more of an independent thought I had while looking at her and fighting back the tears. “So, what you’ve done here, is fuck me over and use me to get to my friends?” “You know…I have had bad things done to me…but that’s low Katelyn …that’s low…” “I need to know to satisfy my own curiosity, was everything you’ve told me in the past 4 months a lie?” “Did you have this plan from the get-go or was it something you formulated?” “Were you born this fucking evil or did you have to learn?” were some of the many questions I had in my head at this time. I wanted to scream them at her. I wanted to choke her. I wanted to kill her. But…I lack the same raw emotions many guys do. And instead of ripping her a new one and moving on…I lifted a finger, looked her in the eyes…put my finger down and shook my head and walked away. I walked away with out as much as a sorry. Every good memory, every good feeling about her was gone. I had a weird mix of love and hate for the girl. And it was pretty intense. I had never felt that way about anyone before, and I hope I never do again. There were times when I wanted to kill her and there were times when I wanted to hold her. I never could find a middle ground. I never lost my feelings for this girl. Even now as I sit here and type this entire spiel about her, I’m waiting anxiously next to my cell phone waiting for it to ring and have show the picture of her I took.                Eventually we got back on speaking terms. But it was always about Kevin. Or Joe. Or   Tyler  . Or some other guy that I really didn’t want to hear about but I forced my self to in the hopes that one day she would realize the error in her ways and fall madly in love with me. That and I am a nice guy and I have no spine. Things went ok for me for a few weeks. I got up every morning hoping the events of that fateful 11 th  day was just a nightmare I was having and I could look forward to going to school and seeing her. Yea things were going ok in my life…that is until one day in January when me, Kevin, Tim, and Kate all went to mountain creek. Ha-ha. I think about that night everyday. The time I first told Kevin how I felt about Kate. The night I first cried in front of my friends. The wonderful night when my hopes of being anything more that a friend to Kate was dashed when Kevin came down the hill saying how gross it was when someone drools on you and bits your lip. When Kate came down laughing and saying how greedy she was and wanted more. How hurt I was that my best friend and the only girl I liked made out…20 ft behind me. Ha, even now as I sit here, 7 months after it happened and I’m the only one who remembers it. Here I am, 7 months after it happens…and it still hurts to think about.    Even today with all me and Kate have gone through…I still never told her how much that hurt me.                And I would have been ok with that if it ended there…but it didn’t. No… it seems Kate decided it would be too nice if she stayed friends with me. She completely ignored me and told Kevin and Tim how much she hated me. That was pleasant. Isn’t having a best friend grand? That was one of the worst months of my young life. I know what your thinking…and its true…I am melodramatic…and I am taking this too seriously and yes I am just like every other teenager in the history of mankind…but let me pose a question to you…Anyone who commits a crime will say there innocent if there smart. No one believes them of course, because there criminals and there supposed to say that…but what about the exception? The one guy who truly is innocent? His voice is drowned out by everyone else’s lies. What does that have to do with whinnying teens? Simple. If every teenage who ever existed at one point in their life probably thought there life was the worst. Of course…no one believes them…why? Because there teenagers and that’s what there supposed to say. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE EXCEPTION? WHAT ABOUT THE ONE KID WHOS LIFE TRULY  IS  THE WORST????!!!! HIS CRYS FOR HELP ARE DROWNED OUT BY EVRYONES LIES!!!!    Don’t be a fool. Of course I’m not that kid. Sure not everything has gone right for me over the years. Life may have dealt me a shitty hand…but I make the best of it. I might hate my life…but there is not a day that goes by that I don’t thank God for giving it to me. Ahhhh screaming feels better. Now back to my short story with a tragic ending. After that horrible day at Mt creek,       Things just got progressively worse.              In my mind, Kate was still my friend. Denial was all I had left. I tired calling her when I got home hoping that she was just having a cruddy night and didn’t mean to be mean. She never called back. The next day at school, she didn’t let me sit next to her. She was sitting next to Rachel which made no scene to me at the time because they hated each other. That hurt to, the fact that she hates me more than her…ouch. Remember now, I’m still in denial so my thought process of course is…”ok, she just wants to try to work things out with her.” So I accepted it and sat next to Tom.              After school, she started a loud conversation about how she was going to Mt. Creek with Kevin and Tyler. She gave me a dirty look. I got choked up and jut sat down. What I never told her was that Kevin and Tyler invited me to go. I didn’t want to. Not because she was there mind you…no it was that I couldn’t take another make out session between the two of them.    The rest of the week followed suit. Kevin kept begging me to go with them because he couldn’t stand Kate and thought if I was there she would ignore him. That was something else I never told her. Kevin and Tyler hated her with everything in them. Not because she was annoying…well they said she was I didn’t think so…no they hated her because of the way she treated me. I thank God every day that I have friends like them. (no sarcasm) the rest of January went just like that. I was alone and broken and I felt worthless. Yes again, I had my guy friends but…I didn’t have anything to fill the void.              It was around February 10 th  that I had the brilliant idea to get Kate a Valentines Day card. Well cowpokes, that was one of the smartest things I’ve ever done. She actually liked it and kept it…until Kevin ripped it in half…it was also around this time…she and I became friends again…but I questioned this after I learned that Kevin and Tyler told her how much they really hated her. I felt used. I thought she was just friends with me again so she could get Kevin back. It was also around this time; Kevin told me what she said about Tim that really pissed me off. Tim is also one of my best friends and I don’t like kit when anyone makes fun of him. It wasn’t true, but I was very mad at her for a few days.               Then something happed to me that made me believe in true love yet again. We were walking out of our first period class, me Kevin mike and   Tyler   were walking toward our hang out spot when Kate walked by…crying…I felt my heart drop. They all exploded into laughter. But I didn’t, no I felt bad, I felt bad that I wasn’t with her, I felt bad that they were doing it, and I felt even worse about what happened next. She exploded silently into tears and ran outside. They all dismissed it and went on talking; I watched her walk outside and sit crying by her self. I wanted to walk out there with her. I wanted to hold her. I wanted her to cry on my shoulder. I wanted…I wanted…I wanted our love back. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t regret not walking outside to sit with her. Who knows? If I did…maybe I wouldn’t be writing this right now.               Ok, well to make this long pointless story have a real purpose, I’m going to fast-forward a few months. The tl;dr version of the gap is we became friends again but I never lost my feelings.      So now were in today, Kate isn’t speaking to me and I think I know why. Friday was one of my friends’ sweet 16 party. The night before, I was at Kate’s house watching law and order. She started hitting me and messing around, so I tackled her and pinned her to the floor. She then some how got on top of me and my hat fell off. As I reached over to pick up my hat, she gasped, closed her eyes and came closer to me. I grabbed my hat and put it on and sat back on the couch. She then opened her eyes and said in a disappointed voice: “oh, I thought you were going to do something.” At the time it meant nothing to me till I got home and realized that she wanted me to kiss her.              Well this was too much for my brain to comprehended, so I got on AIM and talked to her best friend Stefanie. I explained everything that happened and she yelled at me for not kissing her. I made a vow then that if the chance ever came up, I would take it. This my friends is were the plot thickens. The next day, at Stef’s party, she came over to me and said the words I had hoped to hear for so long: “I talked to Kate, and she wants to hookup.” At the time I was sitting at a table with all guys, and the ones that heard it told me to go for it. So here I was, ready to ruin the best friendship with a girl id ever had. I gathered my thoughts, took a deep breath and got up to go chase the girl of my dreams. As I approached her, she asked me a simple question: “is it true that you want to hook up?” my heart skipped a beat. “um…no…who told you that?” “Stefanie” At this point, I didn’t know what feeling was worse, the betrayal by Stefanie or the rejection by Kate.                Ok, right now the person reading this probably thinks I’m a Emo little bitch who whines about everything. Look I understand why you would think that, but you have to understand how much this girl means to me. Everyone has emotions. Its impossible for me to turn them off, no matter how hard I try to just ignore it and get over it, I know that I’m just in high school, and I know I don’t know what love really is, but as far as I’m concerned, this girl is the best friend I’ve ever had, and to lose her….well fuck it…yea I’m gonna be a little Emo. Ok now back to the story, after that occurred, I went back to my table with my head down and my tail between my legs. I sat there the rest of the night, kicking myself, not because I didn’t kiss her, no, that I can deal with, the thing that really pissed me off…was the fact I not only ruined my night, but hers as well. I didn’t stop to think that maybe it was hard for her to. To have some one like her and her not able to return the feelings, that’s hard for anyone to go through. I was so caught up in my rush to satisfy my own wants and needs, I forgot to fulfill hers. She’s told me several time that we where just friends and I’ve ignored them thinking that if I could just prove to her how much I really loved her, she would like me back. Now that I think about all the things I’ve done to her, all the shit I’ve put her thru, it’s a surprise to me that she’s still my friend. If I had know a few months ago that life isn’t a romantic comedy and that not all that “feels right” is right, I would be hanging out with my best friend Kate, instead of waiting next to my phone, hoping and praying, that she’s going to call.
