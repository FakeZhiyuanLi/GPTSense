       tj never called me back, so i dont know if i'm going to texas or not. i'm thinking not right now. my email is screwed up.fucking hotmail. i think she's having a hard time with some stuff and i can't be there to beat the shit out of the people making it worse.i mean she signed off of blog & she adored her blog, so i know something isn't right. i need to be there for her. maybe i should call her. i really want to be in texas with her, but i don't know if i can. i really want to meet all of her friends, but fear that i can't trust myself with one &amp; i would&nbsp;cheat on bryant. i'm depressed right now i think. i'm worried about tj. i hope she calls today.

         i can't believe i'm up this early. i hate it i'm so bored, but still i can't curl back up in bed and sleep. i don't know why. i've tried multiple times then gave up and got online. what are people doing when they are up this early anyway? guess i need a life, huh? i feel like i'm completely typing to myself right now b/c i have met "zero" new people on blog, and i dont even think anyone has read my post. oh well fuck everyone. just in case anyone is reading. you guys could email me or something! oh well i'm going to go look at profiles, maybe find someone with some common interests. later bitches.
