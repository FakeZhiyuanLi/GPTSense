        GOP actually stands for the "Grand ol Party".  Ok, how arrogant is that?  I'm rich but pretending to be a good ol boy to fleece the common people. I'm just grand.   ------------------------------------------------------------   Quote by George Dubya: "Well this is an impressive crowd, the haves and the have mores.  Some people call you the elite, I call you my base."      That little clip is on the trailer for F-911 showing Bush at a fundraising dinner.  http://www.fahrenheit911.com/trailer/windows/medium.php   How does he even reconcile that with his pseudo "ah shucks" persona he is laying on small town America.  Haven't seen F-911, I don't think I need any more incensing, but this little beauty is on the trailer.  I dunno why the Dems don't just run this little clip  ad nauseum and say to hell with the rest of the campaigning, it says it all to me.  It's like, I'm a rich privileged dumb ass puppet pretending to be a moralistic televangelist to the religious right.     ------------------------------------------------------------   Whenever I here the term religious right I just think it should be spelled Reich.  Faith is about humility and atonement and presenting an alternate view of life, it implies culture and enlightenment and choice.  The Religious Reich is about imposing their views on others, not presenting them as something to consider.     ------------------------------------------------------------   Sick of that tired old Republican dogma that Democrats are just tax and spend.  It's pretty clear to me the Republicans are about tax less, spend even more...Huge dept is awesome, because we just end up being in hock to them...It's like credit card companies are a form of lower class financial slavery.   ------------------------------------------------------------   When Kennedy took office the Grand ol Party harangued him endlessly for being a Catholic and were outraged that the President would be taking orders from the Vatican.  Now we got GOP George going to Rome directly to ask the Vatican's help in his reelection.  BEYOND HYPOCRISY...We need a new term for uber hypocrisy..How bout just plain old jerks...   ------------------------------------------------------------   Have a nice day, watch out for all the impending screw jobs...Like the Florida voting reforms that are trying to purge allot of registered lower income voters with their new electronic voting...Why would Jeb Bush want to be Governor of Florida anyway?  Well, it's a huge swing state in elections.  Let's just go see what we can do about that.  He said he would deliver Florida to his brother in the election, and I'll be damned if he didn't make good on that promise.  Never mind all the people who's votes you manged to invalidate...Man the Grand ol Party is really about the people...Aw shucks, look I'm wearing jeans...I'm not a rich power broker....Yuk yuk, vote fer me,  urt...I'm just one of yall...Phhht, oops sorry, caviar gives me the vapors somethin fierce...   ------------------------------------------------------------   My favorite Excerpt from T.H. White's "The Book of Merlyn"   Diagnosis of the human situation:  "What are we, then, at present?" "We find that at present the human race is divided politically into one wise man, nine knaves and ninety fools out of every hundred. That is, by an optimistic observer. The nine knaves assemble themselves under the banner of the most knavish among them, and become 'politicians': the wise man stands out, because he knows himself to be hopelessly outnumbered, and devotes himself to poetry, mathematics or philosophy; while the ninety fools plod off behind the banners of the nine villains, according to fancy, into the labyrinths of chicanery, malice and warfare. It is pleasant to have command, observed Sancho Panza, even over a flock of sheep, and that is why politicians raise their banners. It is, moreover, the same thing for the sheep, whatever the banner. If it is democracy, then the nine knaves will become members of parliament; if fascism will become party leaders; if communism, commissars. Nothing will be different, except the name. The fools will still be fools, the knaves still leaders, the result still exploitation. As for the wise man, his lot will be much the same under any ideology. Under democracy he will be encouraged to starve to death in a garret, under fascism he will be put in a concentration camp, under communism he will be liquidated. This is an optimistic but on the whole scientific statement (...)"
