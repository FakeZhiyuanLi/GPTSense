       I just got home from my first camp. Tomorrow i leave for the second one. Well I guess i shall tell you about what happened at the camp i was at. I went to a Baha'i (my religon) camp. There were a lot of native americans there and this one native american woman came up to bu (my friend) and I and started talking to us in another language. I was so confused. She tlked to us for about 10 minutes and all i understood was, josh threw up in the garbage can, and when is the baha'i meeting over. I felt so bad. I still do. Well I went with Bu-sama and we changed her name to Bu-cilla because she thought it was too much like o-sama and people might think she is a supporter (bu-sama is her nick name). So, lets see...nothing really exciting happened i was away at camp for a week and that is it. well i shall tell you about one of the silly games we played. One was a bunch of small children put on some big pants i mean really big like santa clause sized. And each group was given a bag of water balloons and we were told to blow up all the balloons and stuff them in the pants of the small child in your group. So we did and the pants were very inflated and lumpy. It was very funny and stupid.  so we had many young boys wandering arround with highly inflated pants it was so stupid &nbsp; well i shant bore you with my camp stories  &nbsp; Ta~Kelly &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       My name is Kelly Dunn. I am 14 years old, in the 9th grade, and live in New Mexico. I am about 5'10" and have green eyes and red hair. I am involved in tae kwon do and and pretty good at it. So watch your ass! Today is my last day at home for almost a month! I am going to 3 different camps and then off to Arkansas for a week to visit my family. Not one person I am realted to lives in Arkansas I really have no idea why we are going there. It is my grandparents 50th wedding anneversary. They are my dad's parents i belive and they love to give me money. he he he and I have no problem with that. On my Mother's side they never give me money. they just buy me yarn and crochet needles and stuff like that, funfun NOT. Last week we lost my grandmother (the 2nd) and i had to fly over to tuscon arizona to visit them and go to her funeral. I cried so much! and i dont often cry, the only other time I cry is when I am driving and my dad pulls the parking break because i am about to "hit the camper". But it was so hot! It got up to 106 I belive. I was so sweaty. ICK!!! My brother was away seeing his girlfriend in Seatle so he didnt get to go to her funeral. He got absolute hell from my mom from that, it was pretty funny. My bro is 15 and in 10th grade well going into it. He has a girl friend named Sam, who i mentioned earlyer, that he just loves! She recently moved away and so he followed and went to visit her for what was suppost to be 2 weeks but turned into 3 weeks. So yeah, what else is there to tell you about. I really want a motorcycle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! reeeeeeeaaaaallllllyyyy realllly badly. There is a nice one on our town car lot i think its a Harley. And boy is it pretty its proably like 8000$ though. Which make me very sad. My dad said he would give me a intrest free loan for my first car. but i dont know if I want to be in debt with my dad $8000! Well lets see, i've got a best friend brianna and she is coming to 2 of the camps with me (she and i are forced to go to them) and she is a lot shyer than me. I am really weird and outthere, not afraid of talking to people. And Bu (her nickname) excuse me for saying this, but she is very shy and not to great at talking to people. But we have known eachother for years and i hope we remain friends. Well i must go!  i might not be able to update this for a few weeks but i think this first camp and Arkansas have internet connections. so i should be able to but i dunno!   Ta~Kelly
