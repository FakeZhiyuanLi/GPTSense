        Oh God, I made this cool thing that is super cool. Now I won't get bored anymore because everytime I get bored I can just write stuff on here, thus eliminating all the boredom. Hey guess what? So far, not working. What kind of freakin' idiot made that theory up? Jesus Christ moron. This is stupid, I wish I could say it was a waste of time but its not like I have anything better to do...That's so sad...Well I'm going to go find something else to waste away all my free time, and all you guys had better freakin' love this thing. That's right love it, like you would love your own mother or maybe a pot of gold or something...I don't know...But thats not important right now. Like I said I'm on my way. Have fun, or else.

       I'm hungry. Very hungry. Bill left me at 4:30 and its been like 3 hours. He promised food, and he hasen't come back yet. If he doesn't show up soon I will go crazy. I haven't eaten any real food since breakfast...I feel the darkness closing in around me...Or maybe not, but you know how it is these days. I'm going to go fight the cat for some of his little treat thingys. I hope I will be able to return and post another message, but the cat...He has a hungry and dangerous look in his eye...

       These times for the posts are way off, right now its 5:23 PM and it'll probably say its 12:43 AM. Jesus Christ can't even trust the freakin' Internet these days, giving out inaccurate times...I just don't know what to think anymore. Oh God, nevermind I just found the change time button thingy...Good Lord I'm so smart. Now I'm going to go back and fix all the times for the other ones so if your reading this they have already been fixed and they are no longer wrong which means you were probably sitting there going...what the hell is this guy talking about? Anyway, they are fixed.

       Ok, so I come home from school and I go downstairs to see what Bill is up to. On my way down the stairs I miss a step and flip all the way down the whole freakin' flight of stairs and roll into the shelf, and if that wasn't bad enough the God damn shelf tips over and falls on top of me. Painful as hell, hurt like a mother. Well that is what has happened today on this horribly exciting afternoon. If anything else happens I'll post it on here because I'm a loser that has no life. I have no girl friend, all the sports I play are done for the summer, my life is super boring, I have no friends (I'm kidding I do have friends), and to top it all off I sit here at my computer posting messages nobody will ever read. I really need some hobbies...
