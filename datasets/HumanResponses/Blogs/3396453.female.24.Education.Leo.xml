      im feeling strange again. actually  depress  and feeling down. with one question in mind. AM I HARD TO LIKE? tell me honestly, tell me now. is it the way i  talk ? or the way i  look ? is it because of my  hair  or the way i  eat ? tell me the reason and i'll change them all, i just want to be looked at in a different way,  not just a friend  but.. a  girl  who wishes   to love and be loved  . maybe... soon you will realize my worth,   soon dear GOD i hope.   ~ some lines i put together way back. when i was falling for my guy friend... well, that guy is still my guy friend. no more no less.. but im happy.

      In  Masbate , in the holidays of 2001, i was afflicted by a  crush , which is a terrible thing to happen to a woman (cos it only and shud only happen to girls.. i feel that im too old for it.. oh well) Anyway, I met Mark, the object of my rampant imaginings. It kept going, going on and on. It was great at least for me. There were  rare moments  of us together. One time we were together inside a  tricycle  (how posh i know) i spent the entire time in a state of almost unbearable arousal. I  fancied  I could feel his breath on my neck and shoulder. At one point, his hand brushed my skin as if by accident. I almost came. hahahaha... just blogging!

      i attended a gathering... twas  a family booshit. Oh well, not exactly, just  wanted to use that word.  Sorry mum . where am i? oh yeah, as always in such cases, theres the usual stuff--greetings, hellos,queries. was having a laugh actually.. then i got worried.. deep down,I know id be ask this certain question again, like every single time in every single occasion. no miss! and no matter how much I prepare myself, I always end up being nice to the asker(?)..  how does a 23 year old  NBSB  (yes... that would be No Bf Since Birth), working, close to perfection ha!ha!ha! this is just me..sorry.. joking!) still be unattached? like its a bad thing to be one! duh! hmm...hehehe. See, i got this email once where it supplied a variety of answers to this dreaded question for a  singleton  such as myself.. the ones i practiced were..  a.)  Im a lesbian   b.)  mind your own f*ckin beeswax  (sorry about this again mum, oh! you know what, i know im gonna be swearing a lot here.. so mum read no more!!!) and there's  c.)  Do you want ur nose to bleed?...   see i hated this question..  i hate it with a passion . and i hate the people, sans relative or not, to just ask away thinking they have the right..they do not!   it is rude  ! hmm..anyway, as i was busy chitchatting wit cousins, a relative (wifey to Manoy G)  surprised me with this question. SHIT! no matter how prepared i was with my choices a,b  and c.. i got blank.. aaarrggghhhh!  was defeated again . I wanted to say, "why dont you fuck your nose cos its all red and horny" (this woman has a vey hugey wogey nose thats why)  but i dint say that.. cos i was defeated.. and im such a loser.. and cos  im really a nice person . so i said my piece, my usual spiel "he has not come yet, im just waiting" blah blah blah....as expected..as usual, she goes all knowsy ( and nosey too!) and pa witty... "you know time is running out..baka maiwan ka na... whats wrong ba? u dont wanna end up like a blacklady* dyou?"   arghh ... how dare she!!! shit! and she finished off by saying " hmm..u know what you are ripe, all ready for picking " arrgghh.. and double arggghh..    im not a fruit!   *blacklady means old maid by the way!

      	I have a degree in Psychology, that's a B.S. Im working as a pre school teacher. I love children. i love babies i even love their nappies. I once worked as a psychometrician  (sounds really heavy, but that is just a person who administers tests to applicants) I didnâ€™t  enjoy it tho i got a lot of thank you calls and got a lot of secret admirers... hahaha.. i remember getting a tiny note on my  desk one morning, it says I LOVE YOU MS. NAT... bad hand writing i might add, then my head starts imagining, could it be from  the CEO, the gigantic boss of all bossess (he is now dead by the way, may your soul sir rest in peace tho u always bring tension and unbearable butterflies in my stomach wenever ur at sight), from the mini bald boss of the other department, who'd always give such colgate smile, the cutie 6-footer called Brum who called me Vanessa del Bianco ( hahaha.. oh come on...!) or uhmm... manong  security guard who pacifies me with maxx candy right on cue just when im running out of saliva (as so much was spent on talking and explaining exam instructions to dumb arses) hmmm... none of them actually, hmm who was it from? from the messenger called JR who later on asked me to marry him... hahahaha.anyway,  I dont drink alcohol anymore, as i have developed a belly, i smoke like 6 times in a year (i have a feeling i might get in trouble with this one.. family members, inyaki included...please be mature) just to feel  normal. I drink a lot of coffee and soda. I have a thing for bad boys. I always thought being a psych graduate and all that i could fix them (some charity work). I will go to New York soon with my nys (yes called as such as means, new yorkers) diorelli vergara and jom cruz (love your girls!). Im currently reading a book called "the devil wears prada" its about this 23 yr old, Brown graduate named Andrea who works for Runway, this uber chic fashion spread, and is assistant to an ultimate devilness boss called Miranda. I love Bridget Jones' Diary, books and movie. If she was ever a real person, shed be my other god (as the Lord,bein on top of my list! and i mean this just cos im trying to make a point.. but not rily.. uhmm.. you know wat i mean) Im a drama queen. I had a gay friend in college. He was very, very funny though he had a bad case of bad breath.. Ooopsss! double bad.. now thats really bad. :)

      Funny how at 18 you worry about not being taken seriously and take being a sex object for granted. Later you take being seriously for granted and worry about not being a sex object. HAHAHA just a thought. my soul sistah strongly agrees with me on this one. right sun?

      She will stand out of the crowd on the street. When she walks she walk like a queen, confident and does not look around, though as if there is no one around her. **She will dress in her own style not according to fashion. She is confident of what she choose to wear. Do not buy cheap clothes where they sell in dozen for her as a gift, she will hate it. She likes unique and strange clothes and accessories. Being different is what she loves. **If you want to know her, take times and be patient because she is selective about people she mingles with. She's open minded, but yet she is not letting people get to close to her easily. She likes sweet words and compliments, but not too much. **She smiles with anyone, but inside she thinks she is borne to be a leader. She likes to be in control because it is in her nature instinct. She is a graceful woman , and she has a magnetic charisma, so expect tough competition. **She is a very proud person, so do not do anything to challenge her confidence. She can be mad and act like a hurricane, and later can be like an innocent kitten, but do not fall for her O.K.? **She remembers everything and likes to cherish her sweet memory, so if you find her old photo albums with her ex-boyfriend or love letters that will make you puke, take it easy. She is keeping her sweet memory does not mean she still in love with the old fool, so you do not have to panic. **She will have many guys run after her, so if you have advantage of a good background family, or a famous last name, a successful career then it's a plus. She hates to be poor and she thinks love will not pay bills. She is a sport type and love sports. If you want to date her, prepare to spend big bucks, for your first dinner with her can not be a hot dog stand, but better be the best place in town. She is a generous person, so do not be surprise if she give you a gift more expensive than what you gave her. She likes extravaganza, no cheap gift, no cheap dinner please. Being poor or broke make her depress. If you do not have lots of money, be creative and make your own gift for her. It's unique quality and times spending making it for her is a big deal. You can think economical, but do not be cheap.

      Wait for the boy who will make an ordinary moment seem magical, the kinda boy who brings out the best in you and makes you wanna be a better person. wait for the boy who will be your best friend, who will drop everything to be with you at any time no matter what the circumstances. wait for the boy who makes you smile like no one else, and when he smiles, you know he needs you. wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats and have no make-up on, but appreciates it when you get dolled up for him...and most of all, wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe, because that's where you belong.

      You give and you give and you give and you give and all this time this terrible fear is eating away at you and you want to shout, "Look, I am human. I am afraid."  	`This has caught me with my defenses down.No matter how much I want to remind myself that I have power over my life, my relationships, or my feelings.. i just can't. It was no use. I love him. I love the texture of his voice. I love his funny lil ways. I love his stubborness..i love him.

NO! enough is enough... how dare em just wee his way in into my life and leave just like that making me feel like  crap  for the rest of my young life.. i shall have my  revenge ... ooh.. i have traces of anger in my heart ...
