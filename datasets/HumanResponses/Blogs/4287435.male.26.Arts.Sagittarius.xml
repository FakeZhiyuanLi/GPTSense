      From the moment i walked into work and said goodnight to my Front desk manager walking right past me and out the door telling my he’s going to a bar, i knew tonight was going to SUCK. I was right. To begin with I had to claim down a elderly lady after she woke up and freaked out thinking she was at home and that her family was missing from her room. I had to explain that she was the only one in this hotel room tonight. She finally claimed down and I went back to getting the audit started @ 3am. I normally get it done way before 3am, like an hour or so. That should give you an idea how busy and hectic it was tonight. People kept coming up with STUPID questions, like "where’s the ice machine", as if the big ass signs with arrows aren’t enough. Also I hear "Do you have a restaurant?" No, that building you just drove by with the sign that reads _____ Restaurant is a cover up, that’s really a strip joint. I mean that how i would love to reply to some of those questions. People call in for directions on how to get here always makes me laugh. I hate playing Magellan. If you have to go somewhere you should know how to get there or at least have directions to the place. But nnnooooo, people wait till they are on the fucking highway and decide to call, expecting me to tell them how to get here. The funniest (sense my sarcasm) part about that’s is when they call sometimes they are not even in this fucking state yet and want directions from there home fucking town. That’s just bullshit. I actually told a guy once to call me when he gets with in 6hours of here, he wasn't to happy about that. tough shit. That’s what your ass gets if your that stupid. People, if plan a vacation and you never been there before GET FUCKING DIRECTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE, I BEG OF YOU. THE MOST ANOUYING THING YOU CAN DO TO A HOTEL CLERK IS ASKING HIM FOR DIRECTIONS TO THE HOTEL. PLEASE USE THE DAMN INTERNET OR GO OLD SCHOOL AND USE THIS THINGS I HEARD ABOUT CALLED MAPS. Think about it folks, A front desk clerk has a lot of control of how your stay goes in a hotel, don't be fooled. There are things we (I don't speak for all clerks) can do that you would never even think of, but yet it could make a big difference in how well your stay goes. Just to give you an example: I had to check a guy in who was very rude to me before I even open my mouth. He had a plate of food that he plopped down on my front desk. It smelled like he just dug it out of a dumpster...anyway. He wanted a room. I did my normal routine and said please and thank you when ever was appropriate with out and single word out of his mouth. I had to pretty much guess what he wanted by playing 20 questions. I told him the rate and asked if he has and discounts that he might qualify for, he shook his head no. So I checked him in at our highest rate we had. During me checking him in another gentleman walk in and was waiting. So I handed the other guy his keys as fast as I could to get the god awful smelling shit away from my desk and to get the food away as well. The other guy comes up wanting a room and was very polite the whole time to me so I hooked him up with the lowest rate I was aloud to. My point is, don't fuck with hotel clerks, at least not late at night. Be some what polite. Being rude, at least to me, doesn't amount to “jack squat“ as Chris Farley use to say. Politeness goes along way with me, at least as far as helping you out with getting a good deal.  Peace B

      I had to check in an intresting couple last night. A women with her own gravity checked in with this little guy. They looked like the number 10 when they stood next to one another. They both have been drinking heavily before they came to check in. I don't blame the guy, I would drink myself to death if I had to climb that every night. the both of them where really loud and rude. The could not keep their hands of one another. It as enough to make one puke.  Peace, B
