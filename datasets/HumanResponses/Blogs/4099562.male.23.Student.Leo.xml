      8 days since blog!  I hhhhaaaaavvvveeee been busy though. Thesis writing and all that. Not that I've been able to look at the work for the past couple of days. Mostly due to the fear......  Anyway I have other things on my mind. Not going down to London tonight as barbeque is being held in celebration of my birthday. Much to my annoyance!  Also the car, (oh god not again) is awaiting it's MOT. I suspect given my passion for unloved cars (I'll make a top 10 list at some point) this is going to become a major blog feature. Except I can be arsed to talk about it now.

      Another day, another POLARIS session. Due to licenicing constraints i'm having to do all the simulations for my thesis in one week. Good one....  I'm fairly busy at the moment, what with my thesis and my "crazy"* social life. For those of you that care, here's how this month pans out  7th August: Mary's housewarming in Brighton. Picking Claire and Laura up on the way. 8th August: Last shift at the bar, will probably wake up still drunk and forget to come back home for this 10th August: VEGA interview 12th August: Hanne arrives from Norway, I think I'm supposed to be picking her up. 14th August: Back to the Future in Greenwich Park 15th August: Laura comes back with me to Cranfield for birthday. Double booked with Laurel taking me out to dinner. Oh crap. 16th August: Birthday. Possibly doing some work but mostly drinking. 17th August: Get up late.  Go back to parents to get car MOT'ed sometime around 19th August take Hanne back to Norway in Van. 19th August: on panic re: thesis 7th September: Thesis oral 10th September: Theis in 11th September: Move house 12th September: Visit Chris in Garmany 14th September: onwards on the dole.  All in all its a bit busy

      Seriously - how hot?   I'm going to make a desperate attempt NOT to winge continuously. However my life at the moment does suck. As soon as my stupid thesis is out of the way and the job offers start rolling in i'm away!

      I guess it's typical for me to start something like this then realise that I'm only doing it because I'm bored and so have nothing to say!  Mostly I'm bored down to being ill, being stuck in  urlLink Cranfield  and having to do my thesis. I'll probably not be blogging much this week due to me only having a week trial for a  Polaris , my simulation program.   Wish me luck...

      Hello World.... aren't we looking good today?  Seeing as I'm bored and am avoiding my thesis, it seems only right to share my thoughts with the world. By that mostly I mean  Laura . Hello to you.....  As for now I'm off to bed. Yes it's a Saturday night. I suck that much. Reasons will become only too aparent over the course of the next few weeks.
