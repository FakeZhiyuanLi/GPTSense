						   Hi, my name is Bryan Francis.  I am a 24 year old struggling comedian/public relations representative who hails from New Jersey.  I have never written a blog before, but I am doing this because I need a way to keep my sense of humor sharp during my long and tedious day at work, which at this point could make even the biggest crystal meth addict reach for a Red Bull.  I am also hoping that this makes me into a better writer, and thus, a better comic.   My day job is like most: boring, sometimes pointless, and full of politics.  But, like most comics, I need this job because comedy cannot pay the bills yet, so I have no option.  Although you are probably bored out of your mind (why else would you be here reading this?), I really do appreciate you coming here to read my page.  I will try to post a few times a week, hopefully entertaining you with my thoughts, ideas, and tales of fame and fortune.  Of course, the tales of fame and fortune won't be necessarily true or about me, but close your eyes and pretend, retard.  I chose to name this page  Carpe Diem  for an interesting reason.    I just returned from a short vacation in Boston, during which I decided to tattoo this wonderful Latin phrase onto my right arm.  In case you don't know, Carpe Diem is Latin for "Sieze the Day".  Since I got the tattoo on Monday, my day has consisted of me surfing the net instead of working (I am Mr. Quick Draw of minimizing when someone walks into my office), going home to stuff my face, watching T.V., and falling asleep.  So obviously, my new motto has made me a wild man.  I should probably ask for a refund.  Hopefully the  Carpe  spirit will kick in this weekend, as I'll be in Atlantic City for a bachelor party.  The guy getting married, who is also named Bryan, is really a good dude, and its a shame he has the laziest bastards imaginable for friends.  Seriously, I've seen more planning go into a drunken dry humping session then this bachelor party, which had been talked about for over  six months .  Hopefully, it will be fun anyway.  I'll post about the aftermath in a few days.   I truly mean this:  Thank you for reading my page, and come back when you can.
