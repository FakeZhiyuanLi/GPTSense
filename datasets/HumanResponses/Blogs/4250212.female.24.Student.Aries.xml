      Will anyone read this eventually? I doubt it. But I'm here and I'm bored and I'm just typing out what I feel at the moment. I'm a medical student. Are there yawns or sighs or guffaws in the crowd? Two weeks ago, I was attached to a general hospital as part of my course. I was excited and going all 'blondie', bought new shoes and clothes, ironed out my white coat and did a little dress rehearsal for my sisters. Me and my friends walked into the hospital, all fresh-faced and confident, eager to find out what awaits us just around the corner, eager to poke and prod, discuss and dissect. But I was in for a surprise. As soon as I walked in, I was no longer Miss So-and-So, I was looked at and treated like a fully fledged doctor, patients either looked at us in reverence or distrust and nurses looked at us in amusement or sheer annoyance. And it scared the hell out of me! I won't be graduating for another 2 years but this was an extremely rude awakening for a disillusioned, scruffy medical student as I am! In medical school, I guess we're sort of caccooned in this little comfort zone, there's always a professional at hand to give advise or point us in the right direction, our quizzes were based on diagnosis and symptoms but not life and death directly. In med school, we're expected to absorb so much information that every patient becomes a blurr of text book information, I can't even remember the name of the last patient I examined back in term. And here I was, amidst beds of patients, actually looking at their faces, seeing the expectant look of hope in their relative's faces, being called on by nurses. I freaked out. It took time but eventually I got used to the protocols, I learnt to attach a smiling face to a name and bed number and I learnt that nurses are just amazing, lovely people who get grumpy due to the fact they're sort of ignored in the whole medical process. I've not learnt as yet not to rattle on about complications and a dire prognosis in front of a very concious patient, I've still not learnt not to wince when I see a little boy cry and bawl while a lump in his neck is aspirated and I've still not learnt not to tear when I witnessed a patient's father told that his son will be dead within a month. For the first time in my life, I actually really loved my future profession. For such a long time I was still unsure about doing medicine (and mind you, I'm in my 4th year!) but those two weeks changed my whole perception on my current learning process. I don't intend to be a saint, but I really want to help people as fake as that may sound. It's not a matter of pride, I just want to help with my skill, my knowledge or just my presence. Many doctors have actually told me I'm pretty disillusioned, that after working in the government for a year I'll change my views. Maybe I will become like that. Maybe I won't. But at least for now, I'm happy.
