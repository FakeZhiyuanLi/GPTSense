      That's all i have to say. The weekend was fine with some sand, surf, and vball. Saw people and hung out which was cool but last night killed everything. I was feeling better about life in general and then... Anyway, all I have to say is that it always seems to surprise me and I don't know why, how disrespectful people are, and how freakin' clueless they are.&nbsp; Good guys are definitely hard to find and I don't understand this whole they want me, I don't want you and I want them and they don't want me dynamic. Dammit!!! Let's just say, I feel really violated and nauseas emotionally, spirtually, physically...I need pepper spray.&nbsp; Apparently, this dude thought we were on a date. SOOOOOOOOO NOT! All I wanted to do was leave. GIRL POWER! I just want girl time. No shady, icky guys who just look at me so lustfully that it makes me want to puke. Seriously. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Can't we all just have a good time and have it be platonic and can't they just look but not touch. YUCK! At least I know that I'm not attracted to those shady player bad boys anymore. Thank God! I'm soooooo not ready to date!!! I have no desire and this experience was traumatic becuz it wasn't supposed to be one. Boys are evil, seriously...I really feel like I never want to go out with a guy again unless i've known them for a long time becuz they are not to be trusted...EVER!!!!!!!!  But hey, my jam session at lunch today with Alex was awesome. I learned to play Interstate Love Song by STP, for those who don't know who it's by, and we totally harmonized it and everything.

      I'm so confused about life right now...being single is great. I'm busy all of the time and I'm still learning about myself...just when I thought I knew it all!&nbsp; i'm learning about balancing my time and saying no when I don't feel like doing something.&nbsp; For instance, this weekend is gonna be another crazy one. What happened to chilled and recharged!?!?!&nbsp; 2 parties in OC on Friday night - 1 to celebrate my friend's finishing the&nbsp;bar exam and the other is a close friend from UCI.&nbsp; I hate driving out there after work...sigh. Anyway, Saturday is another beach day: surf, play v'ball, AVP, and 2 parties at night.&nbsp; This time one is for a good friend who's turning the big 2 6 in Venice, and the other is a housewarming party in Redondo Beach for a friend in the industry from UCI.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; I started stressing yesterday and I had to tell myself to stop becuz these should all be fun activities and not mind boggling, you know?&nbsp; Which brings us to Sunday.&nbsp; Surf, church, tofu festival, and hanging out with a friend.&nbsp; I'm really not ready to date, nor do i have any interest, but I guess meeting new people and a dinner once in awhile never hurt nobody before.&nbsp; SO IT"S NOT A DATE.&nbsp; It'll be interesting...   What do I need prayer and support for?&nbsp; Well I guess I've been feeling a little empty and lost in the busyness of life. I hate that...becuz things seem meaningless.&nbsp; I feel like a zombie thru my days becuz I'm just going thru the motions.&nbsp; Balance, I say...but I just feel unmotivated even though i'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing. I don't know what's wrong. Oh well. Another day...same old crap, different day.

      Finally, I got what I wanted this weekend...a couple of days to chill out and not be on some strict schedule.&nbsp; Surfed Saturday with some friends which was a good time, except it was pretty week out there. I guess I still managed to get a few lefts and rights here and there but nothing challenging really. Of course somehow, I managed to wipe out on the one great wave&nbsp;I got and it&nbsp;pounded me so hard that I bounced on my ass on the sand. that was real fun! &nbsp;I went to the beach with Jodi and just got to lay there. That's something I really don't get to do often becuz I see beach=surf/volleyball. Ran into an old friend from elementary/junior high/HS and that was way cool. Her and I used to swim together back in the day and team up on annoying people. Ok, so I wasn't as nice back then I guess.&nbsp; Anyway, just chilled that day and brought Misty (my sorta kinda dog) to my house. Of course she had to wake me up at 6:30am on Sunday morning.&nbsp; But I couldn't be mad at her. I felt to paws on my arm and then her head going under my hand, forcing me to pet her. I opened my eyes to see 2 big brown eyes looking in mine.&nbsp; I told her to go back to bed and she sighed a big sigh and went back to her donut.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Went surfing Sunday morning too and it was much better with a push and a little more steepness. i wiped out 2x but nothing too serious, thank God. Dropped in on my friend's brother which was kinda funny, but come on! It was good wave and I&nbsp;was in position for it.&nbsp;There were dolphins out and about, probably no more than 50 feet from me.&nbsp; I was bummed that I only had an hour to surf cuz I had to be at church by 10:30 in Culver City, but I got my one last good wave and came in.&nbsp; Jodi came too for the first time and she looked like she was having fun. She's so free spirited, and reminds me everyday how more people, including myself, should be.&nbsp; Speaking of being a Wild Woman, I'm thinking of entering the amateur surf competition in August but we'll see. &nbsp;  At church, we talked about something that pertains directly to me.&nbsp; Our pastor, Adam said that pain is a gift from God. We learn to appreciate what we have and we use it to make ourselves better, as well as being able to relate with other people.&nbsp; My 2nd entry complains about love and how I didn't think that I could ever have that feeling back. As I watch my other friends who have gone thru painful break ups, I'm learning from their success with their current relationships. They tell me continuously not to settle for anything less than the best and hearing Adam speak, reminded me just of the hope that there is for love.&nbsp;I"m reminded by this everyday even thru events in my life.&nbsp; My struggle with the politics of entertainment and getting where I am now is a reminder.&nbsp; But, I have the best situation possible and it happened without any effort or obstacles.&nbsp; Everything in its time.&nbsp;If you have time, you guys should read Ecclesiaties 3&nbsp;from the bible, or online...whatever is easier.&nbsp; It sums up life saying, "there is a time for everything. A time to live, a time to die..." etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next time around, I know it'll be even better. I'm realizing more and more how my ex ex did me a favor by breaking up with me.&nbsp; He's the type to not value relationships or friendships as they should be, and he still hasn't grown up to learn how to respect other people's opinions if they should differ from his.&nbsp; I think it's funny that he's so full of himself that he still thinks that I'm sprung on him and wants to "spare" me from hurt. Whatever.

      Not much going on here...but didn't wanna leave this blank for too long.&nbsp; I jammed with a bunch of friends a couple nights ago after our Fox Happy Hour.&nbsp; Surf is flat but I'll be out there bright and early in the morning. WOOHOO! I feel like something is missing when I don't get to go for a few days.&nbsp; I'm about to attend a panel for "Jonny Zero" an new fox show...but i'm bummed I didn't get to go to the OC panel which is happening right now.&nbsp; This conference is for the Television Critics Association so it's very celebrity driven...which means that the cast is there right now, which means that I woulda gotten a chance to see them interact as real people with the press...BUT I'M NOT STAR STRUCK! Okay, maybe a little.&nbsp; I'm going to the party at our lot tonight for a little bit so I should get a chance to actually meet the OC Cast. That'll be fun.&nbsp; I'm taking my date...my mother...becuz that seems like the Hollywood trend lately =)&nbsp; That's it for now. SURF ON!

      Even after I've changed my old ways and in my opinion, have grown up a bunch, I find myself still apologizing for things that happened almost 10 years ago.  After meeting up with PDR, Henny, and Henny's friend from UI last night, I spent about 20 min alone with PDR.  He started asking me what happened with us in the past and why I suddenly changed when he got back from his Johns Hopkins program.  He kept calling me the "violator" becuz he said that I was his first gf and first love and how I basically robbed him of that feeling forever.  "You only have that feeling once. You changed my life", he said.  He came at a time when I had already been cheated on 2x and where I was really insecure about guys, relationships, etc.  I'm a changed person now but it took screwing up in college and breaking other hearts.  What goes around comes around, right? Well right after PDR, I dated an jack ass named Scott, who deliberately cheated on me and then tried to justify it...3x that made it.  I don't regret anything that happened becuz that brought 4 years of just dating, individualism and learning more about myself in college. Sure there were dates here and there but nothing more.   And after Justin, my first love, I truly understand now what it means to be "robbed" of that innocent love feeling.  Hearing it from PDR and having to tell him that I wasn't in love with him was hard, but in a way, it hurt for me to tell him that...I wonder if it's really true that you can only be swept away once, or if you can only jump in with both feet once...such is life.  I've found myself apologizing for the hearts that I've broken in the past becuz somehow they find me and want answers now...all I can say is that I'm sorry becuz I know now what a broken heart does.  But I know that God has someone really special for me in my future and I can't wait to see who it is and how they'll treat me.  I have so much love to give and I want the person who ends up with me to love me as much as some of these guys said they did. After all, I'm still a girl at heart.

      I spent my lunch today playing guitar with my friends, Alex and Ryan.  Both music and surfing put me in a trance...I was so at peace just sitting under the tree on the grassy knoll in front of Fox Plaza.  I don't know why I ever let my mom talk me out of being a musician when I was young...it was like a movie. The sun was signing, the birds were chirping, I was as happy as could be playing Metallica, G&R, Strokes, and even some worship songs. Being in the water and playing music makes me feel close to God becuz it's like being one with nature...why can't I write music the way I can do write poetry or essays? Oh well, I'll just play covers and rip off other people who can. Tonight, I"ll be chillin' with Henny and PDR (Pat Ro)so it'll be a nice little Costa reunion. ROCK ON!

      I used to be really good at not taking things personal...well that's not true. Thru college, I was really great at not taking things personally. I got a bit soft when I started my first job at Fox becuz everyone was so nice.  I'm starting to toughen up again but I would say more that I'm in transition.  So yes, I understand that everyone gets busy and I'm not always gonna be #1 priority to them. I guess it's kinda selfish to expect it but I'm a GIRL!!! It happens. This weekend was awesome but as I've told many, I feel like I just got back from summer camp.  I've been non-stop since Thursday night starting with the Maxim party.  It was really fun and I had a good group of people, including my God bro Danny.  I met Justin Timberlake's cousin and saw the likes of Paris Hilton, Kelly Osbourne, Anthony Kedis (Chili Peppers), the drummer from Velvet Revolver/GNR, Ryan Starr, amongst others. Yummy drinks and just really fun. It was at the Hensen's Studio.  Friday, went to HB and began working the surf venue, where I met my team.  One girl is now my buddy and she's the coolest girl in the world.  That's why I was surprised to hear that she's a pro surfer and she used to tour.  She lives in MB and we're gonna start surfing together. That means, time to whip out that dreaded shortboard.  I met Kelly Slater, Rob Machado, Tim Curran and Taj Burrows, but my fave Andy Irons took off right after the press conference...big bummer. I'll have to continue these stories slowly but they're actaully pretty entertaining...at my expense as usual. no major accidents for me except the last day where I thought my foot was gonna fall off from being caught in between 2 panels of wood...another story.  Friday, it was HB to Staples. Saturday, it was HB to Home Depot Ctr for Moto. Sunday, it was Staples to Home Depot...whew! Tiring. I met great people and had such a blast. It was the most awesomest experience.

      I am trying to be as little drama as possible, but I've come to realize a couple of things in the past week. You know how much you mean to someone becuz they show that they love and care about you not only when times are bad and when they don't have anyone else but when times are good and when they don't necessarily need you for something. I've been having lots of dreams/nightmares (?) recently that have me wake up pissed off and upset. It's hard to be the good Christian and love people without expecting in return, but friendship/love is a 2 way street that takes work from both sides. I'm tired of being the only one that cares anymore and I won't chase a friendship that's one sided. I'm willing to let people be the way they are, butI won't let them take advantage of me or let it take a toll on me anymore. Doesn't mean that I've closed the door or have turned my back. It just means that they've gotta show that I'm important to them in some way. My friend told me something great, "They make you feel that way becuz you let them". I guess I feel a little underappreciated and taken advantage of...just a little but hey! There are others, or will be others, who will value my friendship. Till then, I'll be surfing and be busy with the XGames this week. I'm reallllllllllllllllly excited about that! 72 hours of hell/partying/beach/sun and awesome atheletes. WOOHOO! Nothing like some good surfing to make you forget about "troubles". I dropped in on a 3 ft-4ft face this weekend and has some nice long rides for not so nice days. I'm prepping myself to start teaching too so we'll see how that goes.  BOOOOOOOOO! On-Air w/Ryan Seacrest is cancelled. that was the best show I was working on too!!!!
