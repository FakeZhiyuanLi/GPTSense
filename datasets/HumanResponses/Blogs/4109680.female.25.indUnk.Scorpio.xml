      katuwa naman ang Bebi Mikoy ko...last weekend we scouted for someone to do our outfits for D-Day...for moi, my bebi, and the ento. FYI i've always wanted a very simple gown/dress for my wedding this is because i want people to notice me and not my gown hehehehe....initially i wanted something short tapos haltered yung neckline and would definitely hide my "layered bilbil" but my Mikoy wanted it longer so i researched for sample gowns that i think will soothe his taste and mine as well.  so off we went to find someone to do our outfits. been to sabella at ali-mall and was quoted 12T for my plain-no-beadwork/embroidery-gown and if i'll provide the materials it's gonna be 6T. as for the female ento it's gonna be 1.5T each if i'll provide for the cloth and 2.6T if not. i was quite disappointed with them coz the one who assisted us can't give a rough estimate of how much the dresses would cost...we waited for quite sometime while she was talking to her superior over the phone for the quotation. well, actually my very naive budget for my dress is just 2T.  after going to sabella, we went to jontie martinez of galatea in kamuning. we were greeted by nickky (jontie's brother). i immediately showed him the gown i'd like to wear, he however told me that haltered necklines tend to broaden one's shoulders so he immediately designed a gown for me...it's a very simple A-line-cut-halter-top-v-neck-no-train-dress made of chiffon and a tube-like inner dress made of georgette. A sprinkle of beads are to be placed near the waist (to somehow hide my bilbils) and along the neckline. i actually like the design but somehow it's not what i was hoping for, but anyway the design was so feminine. he told me that he'll lend me his mannequin and that he will personally be there on my wedding day to dress me up until i reach the church. what i'm worried about is the cost. it's way over our budget. for that gown alone, nickky is charging me 12T and for the female ento (if i'll provide the cloth) it's gonna be 1.8T each.  so what made me feel so natutuwa with my Bebi Mikoy? after several computations and a lot of soul searching i came to the conclusion that we can't afford to get nickky martinez of galatea to do my gown nor the entorage's and i'm really bent on getting nanay belen na. however, bebi said that for our peace of mind (besides we intend to get married once) we better get nickky to do our (his and my) outfits. as to the ento's, he's fifty-fifty about it. but with a 7.8T difference we would probably go for nickky's, again for peace of mind. nickky's shop is also way better than nanay belen's and it's sort of our gift na rin to our ento, plus there's a "click-factor" so we probably would be getting nickky na. bebi even called later that he wanted me to feel confident wearing something really beautiful on our wedding day. katuwa di ba?!

      well, i already have a clear picture of what people should wear on our wedding...(1)for the female "entourage", it would have to be a tube or a spaghetti-strap-knee-length (or even upto 5 inches below the knee) cocktail-printed (floral or with stripes) navy-blue-colored-dress (2)for the male "entourage", a beach-like short-sleeved polo shirt with black or blue embroidery (3)for other guests, any outfit similar to the ones the entourage will be wearing (anything that looks comfortable and not the traditional barong-tagalog and long dresses) (4)for Mikoy, something similar to the male "entourage" but of course a lot more expensive looking. what i'm worried about is what I'm gonna wear!!!! i'm torn between wanting to wear a knee-length white cocktail dress (because we will be having a really small-informal-morning-garden-wedding)or a traditional gown with all the embroideries, beadworks, chapel or even cathedral train, very long veil, and really difficult to wear and move around with. well, i consider myself a non-traditional bride, i always opted to do something different, however, if i were to ask Mikoy's opinion, he would rather want me to wear something longer than the knee-length kind i wanna wear (but in fairness, he always said that i better do what i feel like doing)...so i'm really confused. of course i would want to wear something comfortable, however, i might get disappointed later on when i get to look at our wedding pictures and i'm not wearing something that most brides are wearing on their wedding day, a real WEDDING GOWN!

      i just turned down two prospective job offers simply because one company is asking me to work 6 days a week with a 2 year contract and the other one is asking me to do graveyard shift with a 1 year contract. i just can't compromise my time schedule with these companies. if only there's a job where i only have to work mondays thru fridays from 8am to 5pm...or better yet start my own business...but am just not brave enough to just leave my current job and venture the unknown...a monthly paycheck (or should i say payslip) keeps me peacefully asleep at night...oh well....

      as you can see, i just started this blog site. i guess it's a good venue to say my innermost thoughts especially when everyone's so busy doing their stuff. so what are these thoughts?   (1) mikoy, my boyfriend of more than 6 years, and i are getting married na on the 24th of february at the malate catholic church!!!!!!! gosh am just so excited! last saturday, we were able to book na a photographer, ariel javelosa! but of course, everybody knows that ariel rarely does the photo shoots, he has loads of people working for him. we booked him because of very good reviews from the w@wies, an egroup of soon-to-be-brides-and-grooms. and guess what! we were able to get his one-man-photo-service-only-package for half the price (thanks to Grace's,ariel's niece,"errors"). well, i personally don't think that Grace gave us a wrong quotation, i mean, we were only having a really small-morning-weekday-catholic-rites-only-wedding, as in 30 people max! so all expenses are gonna be squeezed. yeah, you read it right, 30 people. why? because of financial constraints, you see, we were paying for our condo unit mortgage and we're not expecting any financial support from our families for our wedding nor for the mortgage. we basically don't wanna burden our families with such issues, we want to show them that we are financially stable before getting married. so, in order to furnish our condo asap and pay our bills on time, we opted to have a really small intimate wedding. i've read several articles about it already and the idea is really not that popular here in the philippines where weddings are considered community affairs. well, people would just have to accept that my groom and i are not willing to spend way too much money for a one-day affair. loans, in whatever form, are just not in the picture. well, you can say that i have way too much pride in my system, and i can't blame you, i'm just a practical gal.  (2)i'm seriously considering shifting to another career. at the age of 25, turning 26 in november, i'm just so pissed off in this "career" of mine. fyi, i'm a "researcher" in this catholic school doing "statistical" stuff for this educational "community"! the job sucks, i'm always infront of the computer (which i like by the way) searching for info regarding education (this portion sucks), creating "lame" questionnaires (i don't have any educ background), doing "statistical computations" (if you can call mean, median, mode hard-core statistics), and writing stupid reports (discussing lame results). i've always wanted a non-eight-to-five-o'-clock-job, with time at my disposal. but i guess it will take a lot more years to achieve that. but then again, i don't wanna be stuck in a company that call themselves a "community" when people are being bullied every now and then; where work (mine in particular) is not appreciated ("so wala palang kwenta yang study na yan!"); where i'm being forced to write crazy feedbacks/notes about certain "studies" i have done in order for this supervisor/administrator to present to the executive staff the actual results of these "studies" and get credit for presenting it; where i'm forced to present to a group of people the results of my "studies" and let them criticize my work while they were suppose to be there not as thesis-defense-jury but just as listeners and make necessary actions based on my "studies' recommendations"; and other stuff i just can't take anymore.
