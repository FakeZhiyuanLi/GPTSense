       In the Quest for...   ...beer money, I have hopefully sorted an extra part-time job. As P.A. (or personal arse-hole, as Micky calls it) to DJ Micky B, I basicly do all the heavy bits and let him focus on the hard stuff. First gig last night was awesome. I learned the ropes, then hung out at the quietest laid back 18th bday ever, and met the loveliest of birthday girls :)  I managed to 'win' a race last friday, a  urlLink intra-club  team time trial, riding with many of the 'gentlemen-racers'. It was a success, there were loads of kids up there, and we all had a good ride (albeit caked in mud from the wet road surface).  Last Thursday was cool. Got our AS levels back, and got very drunk, and just had fun with most of my mates. This weeks advice, don't drink anywhere near girls under the age of 17, as the bar staff get really uptight.  Sorry about the diary effect, but this way I won't forget everything too soon.  Listening to: 'Ghost man on third' by Taking Back Sunday.  Emo, neh?  xxxx

       A man gives his son an electric bass for his 15th birthday ,  along with a coupon for four bass lessons. When the son returns from his first lesson, the father asks, "So, what did you learn?" "Well, I learned the first five notes on the E string."  Next week, after the second lesson, the father again asks about the progress, and the son replies, "this time I learned the first five notes on the A string."  One week later, the son comes home far later than expected, smelling of cigarettes and beer. So the father asks, "hey, what happened in today's lesson?"  "Dad, I'm sorry but I couldn't make it to my lesson. I had a gig!"  Thanks to wavydavy at  urlLink www.veloriders.co.uk  for this one.  So why haven't I started gigging yet? I've been playing for almost 3 months in total now, and I'm getting alright. Bass players have the advantage of being able to stand at the back, and plug away at root notes on stage, so can get away with being crap. But nope, not me!!  I don't know why, and I don't really care, but for some reason, I can't do things badly. That's certainly not to say that I'm talented to some insane degree, or even just a little, because I'm not. I just have to point out that I cannot do anything in public unless I'm competent enough not to attract attention. I didn't even book a driving test until I was better than most of the people I know that had passed (I failed for a stupid mistake so you all know) and only played bass with more than a few people around after much practise, and far too many beers at a party.  Most people I hang around with don't care. Messing up in public isn't a big deal, even I don't think so when I do, but I don't give myself a chance to most of the time. Only one of my friends has ever seen me drive (and it was a huge embarrassment) and I was ridiculously shy at the shop where I work part-time until I knew everything there was to know about school uniforms and industrial clothing, incase I got something wrong.  I can't explain it, but I can't do anything unless I'm going to do it well. Maybe it's a bad thing, but I think it's good. I get really focused on trivial things, so end up getting all sorts of weird and wonderfull skills, and that can't be a problem, can it?  Today I was listening to Dashboard Confessional, specifically 'saints and sailors' and remember to breathe.  smile, it's better than nothing.  xx

       Tiffin? neh? Mate...     It's strange really.  All year I've sat on my arse and done nothing. I did the work I had to I guess, I went to most of the classes. I did some revision. I went to all the exams, and wrote as much as I felt I could. I went home, and have breezed through those last weeks of college. And it's just hit me. these exams decide whether I get back to school and what university I go to, and on friday, I find out whether I have wasted 12 months and will become a bin man.  I always seem to do this. I can't motivate myself properly, but I know that work has to get done, so of course, I end up scared to death that my life was a waste (how ironic). Worst, I'm bummed anyway, because all this time I was right, and I'm currently doomed to being single, so can't even look forward to the post exam drinking!!!  I shouldn't complain really. Harry shuttleworth will be kept happy, as his CD has become the soundtrack to my breakup, and will from now on be a big part of my life when happy or depressed, and A Girl actually invited me out after results are opened, so that should be good (albeit in a group, but it's better than nowt)  Still listening to HS's EP, but who can blame me.  have fun guys x

       Morning Campers!!  neh?  After another heartbreaking that'll take a few months to recover from, I'm back on the brink of moral collapse. A caring friend told me to write a song to help let out the feelings, and move on from things.  Easier said than done!  My poetry has never been much, and song writing is the same but with music (argh!!) so I spent last night lying in bed looking for the words to say why Hate and love are the same thing in many cases, and why I would do anything to spread a relationship thats wafer thin over even more time. I like what I have so far, it's crap, and musically it uses my four least favourite minor chords (can you have favourite chords?) but it's better than bottling up like normal.  I stole the title from this blog to give me a start, a short summer relationship song? perfect I think! But then I couldn't figure out to go, I knew it would be 2 or 3 verses, with a chorus and bridge, but orders, arrangements, lyrics even, were too much. I chose a song to base mine on (thank you to Brand New's classic 'Quiet Things That Noone Ever Knows') and followed the plan. Verses 1+2 out the way, chorus finished, but what about the bridge???  I know it's sad, but the bridge is my favourite bit of any song. It reminds me of myself, i guess. It doesn't quite fit, it's a bit different, but people still like it at the end of the day, and it's allowed to hang out with the rest of the song. And I cannot write one! It's ridiculous, but I cant see the song with it, and I can't see it without.  I think this may be too much of a challenge for aych an amateur singer songwriter, but I'm going to keep on plugging. Back to my title, in a quest to find a song structure and musical sound to say how I feel, I realised something terrible. My favourite songs on my PC at the moment are Sting, and Busted!! Neither are cool for a 17 year old 'punk, rock and stuff' fan to listen to, so what am I to do? I think I'm just going to admit defeat, and take it like a man: OK, I said it, I like a busted song!!!!!  That'll do for now, I think - today I was listening to Harry Shuttleworths EP 'Widescreen dreams' {www.harryshuttleworth.com}  stay cool kiddies x x

       So far today I have -  had a shower, shaved, got dressed, walked to the shops to buy phone credit, sent a text, spent the rest of today waiting for a reply.  Why am I so sad as to waste a precious summer day of holiday waiting for a simple message one might ask? My phone works if I go out, or go training, but for some reason I can't bring myself to leave the house, in case when the reply comes I'm unable of reading it out of the house?  I know this is ridiculous but it's true. I can't help it, sometimes a thought or idea gets into my ugly little head, and takes complete control. I spend hours sitting around the house saying I have to go out and do something, only to find myself waiting by the phone for the next 6 hours. and of course it can all be put down to girls. Well a girl. Pah, I'm pathetic!!!!  On a lighter note, today I have had a chance to play some bass geee-tar, and have learned some cool RHCP songs like californication.  woohooo go Ed!!!!

        Well well, what have we got here?     Quick check -  Rather than talking to myself (been home alone too long lol) i'm writing stuff on the 'net that noone will ever read!!! awesome huh?   Todays thoughts -   a)  I miss Rachel. Shes been away for a long time, and after she phoned me on Monday, and talked to me on MSN today I now really miss her. Few people get my sense of humor, and I don't blame them, but she always did... no good can come of her Germanic lifestyle!  b)  I can't name my new emotion!!!! It's sort of a cross between knowing that christmas (or other good thing) is really close, but you aren't there yet, and what happens when you have too much caffeine. I blame Lauren.x  c)  Somehow I've upset Joe. end of thought.  Still, lets not go on, i'll save that for another posting...  (today I was mostly listening to Brand New - Play Crack The Sky)  see y'all later. xx
