      I am not one of the johnnies-on-the-spot in Boston; from my seat here in White Hall, Maryland, this convention has been informative on lots of things, almost none of which are significant. I really liked Obama, all the while cognizant&nbsp;of the power of a pretty face; I really resent the pundits and the way they focus on non-issues (did Hillary have a sour face during Theresa Heinz Kerry's speech? or does her face just look like that half the time? I know mine does)&nbsp; I was  terrified  by non-convention reports today that election reforms have made almost no progress, especially in Florida, and we can have very little confidence that votes will be properly counted and that rightful voters won't be disenfranchised; I am reminded of the scene in Fahrenheit 9/11 when the Black Caucus members each stood up before the Senate to challenge the legitimacy of the election, and the Senators ignored the petitions, can this happen again and will it tear our fabric apart?!  I wrote to both my Senators about this; I asked, "where were you?" To his credit, Senator Sarbanes had an aide write back. But although his explanation makes perfect sense, it really isn't what I wanted to hear.  He said: "Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about the depiction of the joint session of Congress held to count the electoral votes of the November 2000 Presidential Election in Fahrenheit 9/11.&nbsp; I appreciate hearing from you about this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp; In response to your concerns about the lack of Democratic Senators joining members of the Congressional Black Caucus in objecting to the count, you should be aware that under 3 U.S.C. ยง 15, for an objection to be heard, it is necessary for a Senator and a member of the House of Representatives to object to the counting of electoral votes.&nbsp; Then, for the objection to be upheld, a majority of both houses of Congress must vote to uphold the objection.&nbsp; In January 2001, Republicans controlled the House of Representatives.&nbsp; Thus, even if objections raised by members of the Congressional Black Caucus had been signed by a Senator, the outcome of the counting process would not have changed.&nbsp; Recognizing this reality, the Democratic Senators refrained from tying up the Congressional process to delay an inevitable result.&nbsp; Such restraint should not be taken as an indication that Senate Democrats disagreed with the very serious objections raised by Members of the House regarding the conduct of the Florida election proceedings.Again, thank you for contacting me to express your views about this matter.&nbsp; Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future regarding this or other matters of importance to you." Well, some things are important enough to "tie up the Congressional process" about. That's waht the Black Caucus members were doing, and I respect them for it!!!!!!!!!!! And what will the Senate, not to mention the Supreme Court, do if there is more election abuse in 2004?

      Why does the High School crowd (now conveniently convened on an online "tight circle" continual chat) still have the power to terrify? One would think it was neutralized after the 20th reunion, when I realized that for us at least, NO ONE HAD CHANGED ONE IOTA SINCE&nbsp;ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. The snooty ones were still unbearably snooty, friendly ones friendly, the future suburban matrons were now suburban matrons, and most were just drippingly successful. It's always been a high-powered bunch, ever since coalescing out of individual lower-grade schools into a terrifying Junior High environment,&nbsp;when our teachers announced a surfeit of talent, forced to change the curve and making everything much more competitive than our factory-like school was accustomed. But it has proven true, because our class, in our town, still represents the smartest bunch of people I've ever had to contend with, high-powered college and ivy-league grad school notwithstanding. This bunch were, and are, a high-powered, directionless stew, some of whom emerged from the pot to&nbsp;shine in the real world&nbsp;without ever standing out among our crowd. And WATCH OUT for the zingers!

      The tedium of hearing old classmates nudge each other in oh-so-unfunny repartee has shifted now that one classmate who describes herself as the "class Philosopher" has posted some challenging queries: what do we think of "Fahrenheit 9/11"? What do we think of same-sex marriage? (Why don't I remember this person? She seems fabulous!) This has resulted in a bit of a flurry from the less clowny types. One person answered at length, thought-provoking, considered answers, then THUD. No more replies, but I for one considered (at length, without doing anything) at least thanking them both for the welcome change! Next, a classmate (the same one who made the joke I appreciated last time) stepped in to say we mustn't, mustn't go there, we should just be using the&nbsp; online reunion chat to get reacquainted. It was just as in keeping with his personality as the previous, welcome joking post&nbsp;had been, but I just wasn't buying! Why can't we go there? Fortunately the moderator stepped in and acclaimed that as long as we were civil, we could post on whatever we want. Thank you, moderator, I am very relieved! Still, I know this crowd. I almost don't dare post. Will she or won't she? Will she get creamed online and suffer grade-school humiliation all over again?

      My high school class, which approaches its 30th reunion next year, has gotten hold of the web-based "tight circle" concept. Each of us is personally invited into the online circle, and as we join, if we post, our message is received by everyone in the circle. I've been a member/lurker of mine for about a month, and as the process has unfolded I'm less and less inclined to attend that upcoming reunion! Of course we get the inevitable "I am out of the office until July 25" automatic replies, which I sincerely hope they can filter out sometime soon. One classmate remarked, "So-and-so just wants us all to know that he gets 2 weeks vacation," -- I always enjoyed that classmate's sense of humor.   That's the main point, I guess, of this "tight circle" experience that is so unsettling. No one has changed one iota. Everyone is exactly the same as we approach our 47th birthdays, and some of us tell exactly the same jokes. In one case, the same joke was directed at me in 8th grade science class (I had no idea what it meant! No surprise to my classmates, I'm sure!)   One thing I regret is that it's the clownier types that are posting right now. Did any of them have restraining orders on classmates as they claim? I wish I had known about it!
