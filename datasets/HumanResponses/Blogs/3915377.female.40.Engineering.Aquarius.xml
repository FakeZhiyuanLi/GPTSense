      OMG - can you believe it's like 70 degrees outside in the middle of summer in TEXAS????&nbsp; For those of you in CA, this is unheard of in Texas - especially in July!!!&nbsp; It's just a tease, though.&nbsp; By next week the temp will be back up to 95+ and we will be bitching and moaning about how hot it is here and why don't we all pack up and move to Wyoming or Montana!!!!!  I have come across some really funny blogs this past weekend!&nbsp; If I can figure out how to link them, I will!&nbsp; Gotta go take care of the kidlet(s).&nbsp; My son is asking me to go play t-ball with him - little does he understand, I'm only on my second cup of coffee - I need at least three to wake up!!!  Bye - for now!

      For some reason or another, Friday has always been my favorite day of the week.&nbsp; Maybe it's because it is the end of the week or maybe the beginning of the weekend!&nbsp; I always wake up in a good mood on Fridays!&nbsp; And today is no different!&nbsp; I have done really well this week with eating and working out.&nbsp; I guess I'm just a little bit more focused this time around.&nbsp; Obviously my creative side is not awake yet - so I'll go - for now!

      Time to make the donuts - oh - I mean time to work out. I can't think yet - it's only 5:45 in the freaking morning! Yesterday was my free day or rather "free-for-all" day. I ate so many cookies (and cookie dough) that I was completely miserable. As I reflected last night on yesterday, I thought "ya know Vic, why in the hell do you do this to yourself?" And myself answered "because you know that you really aren't going to do this and that everyone thinks you are an idiotic, obsessed, fat, middle-aged woman!!!! Ha Ha!" I promptly beat the living crap out of that "self". People don't really think that - that's just my warped pea brain making excuses! I am not an idiot. Obsessed - yes! I have to be dammit! I am of the mentality that it's got to be a way of life-not just when it's convenient!!!!!  &nbsp;  I have friends that get pissed when I tell them I can't come over and hang out!&nbsp; They have nothing but crap lying around - chips, donuts, cookies, every kind of junk imaginable!!!! Then they complain they don't ever have any energy and they are just soooo tired - whaaaaa!&nbsp; I printed this out and had them read it  urlLink http://skwigg.tripod.com/id13.html &nbsp; it didn't do any good!!!! &nbsp;  But I will stop - for now!!!!

      I'm tired of people telling me to "get with it".  I am "with it" dammit!  Just because I don't have every PDA, BDA, FMA, CLA, JJA, and/or BAA to organize my life does not mean I'm not "with it".  But, then I really take a look at my organizational skills - or really lack thereof - - but only briefly.  Because it scares me!  Anywho - got to get off the puter because I really need to do my HIIT because then I have to take son to Taekwondo then do dinner, and so on, and so on!
