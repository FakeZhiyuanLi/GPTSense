      Yesterday was.. tiring, to say the least. We ended up going all over town, asking for jobs and application forms. Most places (like argos) dont take people on 'till september because they aren't busy enough during summer.. and you have to be 18 to work in blockbuster, 17 to work in GAME, etc. Popped in the JobCentre, and what utter pants. If everyone relied on that place 15 year ago, no wonder unemployment was 2 in 3 in places :-O  So today we returned, armed with CVs and our filled in application forms for Currys (dixons). I also handed a CV into The Link, Leonards Electricals, Staples UK, The Hartlepool Mail, Focus DIY, got an application form for Vue Cinemas (don't think I'll give that back, though), but before all this I handed in a HELL OF A LOT of money in to the bank- in coins- which i carried to the post office who wouldn't have it, first.. and got a Scarlet Band bus to Stes with it (IN AN ALDI BAG!). Thank god it didn't tear and spill £135.50 worth of 10p and 5p coins all over.   Scarlet band busses? Yeah, same here- wot the fuck! It was pretty  knackered for a bus, and you didn't even get a real bus ticket. That was the only 'Scarlet Band' bus on the whole timetable- for the whole week. The bloke was canny like. And he had the Stranglers on the radio. First british bus I've been on that had a radio :-O although I'm not sure that- whatever it was, began life as a bus... (or something with an engine)!  Been over the road all night. Some mad Scottsman they know turned up. What a nutter. Canny like, and he had a van full of trials bikes :-D My mates got a job down the un-locally local, and apparantly the boss is some cock from down south- so 7 staff are leaving. Me mate reckons I could walk down there in the morning, and have a job by tomorrow. I mite just give that a try... and see what all these jobs I've put in for, offer, too! (If any reply)!

      I did nothing on saturday. Nothing at all! Yesterday I did almost twice as much as that, I watched 'Trainspotting'. Good film. Especially on a new widescreen telly :-)  This morning I wer meant to go down Stes and go looking for a job. Well... I was meant to get up at 9. And get the 10:00 bus. But the bed is tooo comfy and warm :-( Oh well, I'm still gonna go. Just late! Cya my silent invisible friend...

      Since whatever the date was when I did my German Speaking Test, until this morning, I have been locked in a cycle of exams then revision, exams then revision.. and before that it was coursework- coursework- coursework- but now, I'm happy to declare that as of the 25th of June 2004, I am FREE from the living imprisonment which is the English educationary hell known as 'GCSEs'!!! They've gone alright- each one better than I was expecting the night before, and I think I've done quite well! Although- come to think of it, if I'd have done a bit more revision- and drove myself into serious depression and wacky mental health problems, I may have done a bit better. But it's not worth it!   My last exam ever (statistics) went OK. Considering I missed many lessons, I managed to answer nearly all of the paper. Apart from the bit that mentioned standard deviation of something or other, and working out the mean from the standard deviation or- WHATEVER! It's done and dusted and I can shut up about it! Needless to say- the weather was just as Mr Malcolm (schools exam officer) forecasted over a month ago, when he told us to imagine 'in a months time, when you walk out the exam hall and you've done all your exams- there's a clear blue sky- a few white fluffy clouds..' etc. (or something along them lines)! I rode to me grandads after that, and managed to shread my trousers to bits due to abscence of chain guard- and feeling of utter carelessness. But who cares, I'll never need to wear that uniform- EVER AGAIN. Brilliant!  So I've completely done and dusted with school education. What else has happened today that's been life changingly excellent? Our new telly came! A 32" widescreen- panasonic, with a panasonic DVD recorder. Oh yeahh. I've given it a good wearin in tonight, while me mam 'nd dad where down the pub. Lovely jubbly big flat screen, and we have all our sky channels back on since I rang the number on the card, after everything cocked up ages ago and our old sky digital box shorted out the phone lines and lost half our channels... did you know when you ring sky they're all indians on the phone :-0! I was in such a good mood today, I even enjoyed putting up the flat-packed integrated TV stand thing. This was a day to remember!

      Well turns out nothing was on fire. Apart from the fire..  The good and bad of today has evened itself out. Well, we went back to lennards electricals and ended up buying this panasonic? TV and DVD recorder- which was a miles better deal than the one we seen yesterday, and if ya work it out we saved £400! It's coming today/tomorrow (whatever way you look at it) at 3:00, by which time I will have done this stats exam which starts in 9 hours and I'm yet to revise for..   ...and todays badness? England lost. England lost, but everything could have been different if a certain smack head ref had been a bit more fair during the whole game, and also if THAT goal was ALLOWED :-@  Ste and Kat's battle to outpost each other on my forums has been a kind of amusing annoyance...  Well well well. The day of the LAST exam, and the last time I'll go to that certain council ran gaol until results day. I feel a bit lost. Should I revise or go to bed? I've peeked at a practice exam. Not attending most of the lessons has not helped me, as I don't know a thing. Oh wells. Life will be SO MUCH BETTER in 11 and a half hours time! BED IT IS!  Keywords anyone? Blog weblog hartlepool pools monkey hanger monkeyhanger teen british europen english north east journal diary ...  PS: HOW COULD I FORGET?! GOOD NEWS! MY UNCLE WHO LIVES IN NEWZEALAND WHO I'VE ONLY SEEN TWICE (HE CAME HOME IN '96, I WENT THERE IN '98) IS COMING HOME IN SEPTEMBER! WOOOO!

      I have my LAST EXAM TOMORROW!!! It's stats and I hardly went to any lessons so I'm not really bothered about it but I'll do some 'revision' later...  On Tuesday night (night of last post) I went to snowdons, with Kat and Jamie'o and Elliot.. it was a good night :-D, I also had a chinese takeaway- woo!  Yesterday it was me Dads birthday.. we had a meal down the local pub, searched around lennards electricals and stuff for a new telly- £700 for a 32 inch widescreen (why do they still use inches)? and it comes with a DVD recorder! (Philips). I reckon we'll get it. Oh, and put me dads new car radio in, but had to go to halfords for a male->female aerial plug adapter- which was £4 :-O  Ahh well. It's nearly 2:00PM and I haven't left my room! I'm starving, and I think somethings on fire downstairs. Cyaz...

      Heh. I haven't posted since Saturday. It's TUESDAY :-0  Fathers day= revised for business studies. Nothing happened. Nothing. Yesterday- had business studies exam. Didn't have a clue about half the paper. Bugger! Then I revised for physics all night, apart from when I did nothing at all, and the other times, when I watched Coronation Street. Twice.  Todays a beast! I did mint in me Physics exam this morning, no- not because I had half the formulas written on my arm :-).. and I only have ONE EXAM LEFT :-D and I cleaned out my safe, only to find I am in the possession of £260. And my new bank account- debit card thing came today. And I found my savings account book. And I have lot's a money. Yey.  I wonder if 'Cripes' is a real word..?

      Didn't buy a camera for me dad. We bought a new car radio/cd player, outta Halfords. And I spent 2 hours putting one in me auntys car for me uncle. Her old one was nicked outside Millhouse Baths, - spent ages figuring out what wire was for what :-0   Just watched the Parole officer  (channel 4 film) , its gotta be one of my favourites!  Me dads been on a 35 mile walk for charity today... meeting people at 7AM, walking at 8, home by 10. And I think I'm more knackered than him. Shame I didn't raise £200 for it :-D

      It's probs the best day I've had in the last 2 months! Combine the fact that I was up EARLY because at 8:00 the cavity wall insulation men started drilling INTO MY HEAD, so I did not miss the day! Having a coal fire heated house (no gas, cable TV, or broadband here)! we had the benefits of a government grant discount of 70% on making our house energy efficient.   I opened a new bank account, I bought some trainers, I lazed quietly at home and was kindly treat to a night in Pizza Hut (ok, not too glamerous but very kind seen as it was HIS birthday)! Cheers Fother.  After that we all went into ASDA and- as me and Dan were looking 'round trying to find everyone, we walked past this man with shorts on pushing a trolley. I remember thinking 'What's he looking so happy about'.. I thought it might be the fact that me and Dan were laffin- cheerin him up- but as he walked past he really farted- quite loud and disturbingly voilently, I'm sure something was trying to escape! Me and Dan looked at each other and I started laffin. 'Ya meph' he said. He thought it was me.  I noticed that the man had a lot of vegetables as I spotted him at the till... and also, another rant here, I told the bus driver on the way home '55p to top of (where I live), it's erm (the other name for the place where I live), he asked me how old I was, I said 15, he said well thats a pound please. £1? It's fucking 55 pence you fucking tard! And before that I'd always paid 50p, before getting bollocked of this other gimpy old git who swore that because I live in (this certain place)about 10 metres further, it was DEFINATELY FIVE PENCE MORE! Dick head. I didn't hang around to argue, 1: because I'm actually 16 and that was the price I SHOULD pay, if I hadn't said I was 15, and 2: the bus was full of chores and these people from (this other place, I'm not leading anyone to where I live here!) lets just say you shouldn't mess with those people. And there was a que behind me. And the bus was in the middle of the road.  Tomoz me and me mam are going on a digital camera hunt, for me dad, for his birthday and fathers day! (Different days but close enough). My 'exceedingly rich' great uncle is donating an unwanted shed to us, too. But he sold his practically new mercedes to some other bloke, without consulting us. And we have to come and take the shed to bits ourselves. Damn. Me mams cars fine (although it's a ford, I don't like fords, but it's mechanically sound) but our awld vauxhall vectra is getting on a bit now, the central locking don't work.. the alarm don't work.. the radio's shot to hell and the dashboard display, it rattles everywhere, the roof leaks (well, not no more- thanks to window, kitchen and bath sealant)! and engine bits and bobs are really starting to feel the effect of round the clock miles and insane thrashing.  It's just hit me that this time next week I'll have no exams left. I'll be totally free and out on my own, if you know what I mean. School is then TOTALLY over. It's kind of strange, I've been going there for the past 5 years! And now well, thats it. It's all over. I've got to know some good mates over the time, but GET IN!  Well. Song of the day: Come on England! (Variation of Dexy's midnight runners- Come on Eileen! from the 80's) I tell ya, euro 2004 fevers really gripped everyone! Sound of day: Man in shorts with the vege, farting as he walked past. Sight of day: This drunk man trying to walk straight, in the town centre. It was only 10:00 aswell. The shame, oh the shame. Food of the day: just has to be this 75g of 'snack works top of the roast pork crackling- seasoned pork rinds', ooh they were ultimately lush. Just the right crunchyness and flavour. The right fat consistency- and a bit of meat left on each and every crackley bit. There was even that greasy resin left on the inside of the packet, that you lick out when nobodys looking (or, in most cases, when they are).  This blog comes up as listing number 2 on google if you type monkeyhanger in. All-be-it with the old description in the caption, but whoa. 2 weeks and im right up there with the likes of the Alternative Guide to Hartlepool!

      Theres another big exam over with. Business Studies is arse. I did fine! 3 left.  I've just got back from Carlton- a wee village near here (best known for Carlton Outdoor Centre (camp...), where all the primary school kids go). We had a Tie meal (is that how ya spell Tie)? out of this pub. Proper traditional english pub- hand worked beer pumps, loads of old bottles nd beer mats nd that spread all over, dingey smokey atmosphere and one of them quiet men at the edge of the bar with a moustache- the lot, except the blokes married some Tie lass so they 'ave Tie food on the menue. Dead cheap an' all. I had king prawns and all that- and it was cheaper than a Burger King!  Im gobsmacked. This blogging lark is really easy! In the last two days I've been listed in the blogging brits and euroblogs webrings, and my webstats indicate that yesterday, I got quite a number of visits from  technorati  where this things been listed! I'm not just forcing keywords on anything here *cough* but who would have thought this blog from a British, -town of Hartlepool, ( monkeyhanger / hartlepudlian ) teen would be listed around and shite so fast? All it is is a commentary on my exams, so far! Hmm.. imagine what can be achieved... 'JB Industries buys out Microsoft, owner elected president of the EU' (stops daydreaming)

      It's the day before the (main) business studies exam. Revision? Certainly have done some of that- I read the revision guide. It took 4 hours. I can't remember any of it. And I've worked out how many different subjects I've done. 14 subjects. Look:  English Language English Literature Chemistry Biology Physics Music Geography Business studies Maths Resistant materials German Statistics Short course religious studies Short course I.C.T.  I've also done an OCR Level 2 certificate in Enterprise, and err.. I could have done better in everything. I've still got a chance with physics and statistics, but Biz (50% of it) is tomorrow, the final 25% on Monday. I 'could' have done better- but I didn't revise properly. Iv been revising the night before, or on the dinner time. I just simply haven't had the time. I could not have imagined having 2 exams a day like last week. The enterprise thing was last year, but if I add all the last few weeks exams up it is exactly: 1955 minutes, or 32.6 hours, or more than 1 day and a quarter of examness, 22 exams.  I've had a shit day. I've never known a day so boring, and uneventful! I have lost the will to live...  It's Fothers 16th coming up, so were going to pizza hut on friday. Sando has just asked everyone if they'll go to his for a BBQ on friday. He didn't know about Fothers. Poor Sando.  Now I'm off to watch  Coronation Street , then I'll have a skim through the 4, 1hr 45 each, practice exams I have...

      The most unbearably boring couple of weeks of my life are coming to an end! So I've done shite in Maths and German. I won't dwell on that. I can do a resit for maths in November if I need to! (But who gives a f**k about German, never liked the subject)! Only 4 exams left until the END of my GCSEs! That will be like more than 30 hours of exams! Two Business Studies, Physics and Statistics, left. Nice one. Completely brilliant. Utterly fantabulous. Still, four too many!  OOh when I was riding home from the.. English! exam yesterday afternoon, from the road next to the wind turbine I had a great view of what looked like half the town on fire. Turned out it was  urlLink this ! The  urlLink mails  been wortwhile reading lately, with nuclear power station leaks and what not... but whoever keeps putting in pictures of the mayor on his bike every few days needs a good slap 'round the chops. If you wanna see a bit more about 'Artlepool go  urlLink here , and compulsorily  urlLink HERE !  I suppose I'll toddle off and watch some TV. I've been on the computer for like.. 6 hours. Give me a life?!

You could tell it was diahorrea wen there was no screamin? to it. I couldn't take any more. I stuffed my revision stuff in me bag for the next few days, passed on the pie and chips me mam offered me before I went, and escaped from the house. My mam was excluded from work on wednesday and thursday, when they found out that she was living with someone who had the active virus. For 48 hours. Tis friday now so Im back and safe- aren't I? :-O Cheers grandad for them two nights and all the bacon sarnies :-D  If you were unfortunate enough to see I'd posted two identical posts the other day, It's because I tried the email'y in blog thing- which buggered up 'cos it's turd.  Anyway- Tec exam brilliant, English writing exam brilliant, Geography exam smashing :-D and I've just got a lift home off Jamies mam from German- which was total bollocks. I've failed german without trying :-) Never mind...  RE this afternoon. We never had a teacher for the full two year course. I don't know a thing. Can't wait 'till tonight...

      I had an IT exam this morning. It was piss :-D . Me nd dave hung around (the only ones in year 11 apart from vicky) between the exams. Did some maths revision in the library nd by the time I got to the exam I was confiedent with everything but quadratic equations and sine/cosine graphs. Which was half the paper. But 'cos it's so hard, ya only need 50% for a B :-)  Joes mam gave me a lift home, I came on MSN and had a sleep. Apparantly it thundered nd lightned, but that didn't wake me up. What woke me up was me dad throwin up, in the bathroom. Me mams ward was closed (she's a nurse) because of this virus, what she had last week, and now it seems she's passed it to me dad. Causes nausia, projectile vomiting, cramps and diahorrea. Lovely! 'Symptoms usually last from 24 hours to 3 days'. If I miss me exams because of this, 1: I kill both of them. 2: I can't get into the chem and phys courses nd shite that I want. Talk about timing :-(...  A rather uninteresting thing appened at me grandads. A smoke alarm was beeping, so I went to take the battery out the one in the front room. Then we heard it beep upstairs, so I went to take that one out instead. It wasn't that one. I took it out the one in the front room. It kept going (ya know, when the batteries runnin out), so I went back upstairs and took that one out. It kept going! Turns out it was the one in the passage. Me grandad nearly had a heart attack, laffin :-0!  Oh well, Tec exam tomorrow afternoon. Better revise on bitesize. I'm sick of all these exams, the past few weeks havn't exactly been thrilling. It's a load of toss. I've gotta revise the whole of geography tomorrow, for Thursday. Utter, toss.

      14 exams to go! I managed to squeeze in some Biology revision yesterday- and considerin I slept for less than two hours last nite/this morning, I think I did quite well on my Geo and Bio exams! Several brews with 2 teabags in kinda perk you up a bit :-)  Sight of the day: Going to Lukes with Dave in-between exams, his faulty house alarm was going off and a copper came on a BIKE! A normal bike- with 'Police' written on the cross-bar! Well done mate for setting the eco-friendly example with your oversized helmet...  But to more grim news... IT exam in the mornin- haven't revised, don't need to, but more to the point is I've also got the Non-Calculator Maths Paper :-(. Let's just say I've never revised so hard in my life in one night, thanks grandad for helpin me go through stuff- but now I've sat down here I can't remember a THING :-0 im just gonna hope that it's all easy stuff that I can do. I need a B to do what I want at college :-( (chemistry, physics, (therefore A-level maths is needed.. but I wont need it for Photography)!  It makes me feel a whole lot better that people I've asked (well, Elliot and Jamie) havn't  revised for tomorrow. Luke hasn't, much. He dosen't need to :-@. Wish I revised for maths ages ago :-( !  Looka this- all I've talked about is exams. Thrilling eh? It's as thrilling as my next few weeks are gonna get...  Elliot- when you read this I just want to tell you that- giving up meat? INSANE! Hey, I've been in a chicken farm and they don't decapitate chickens, they break the neck in-between the index and middle fingers, and the thumb!

      I've just got back from Liverpool. And wherever the hell the Safari park was on the way back from there. Their were monkeys, wreckin this blokes land-rover and crappin all over it. Heh- animals... you can't help but think they have it better off? As for tigers and shite- im scared of my own daft foot long cat, imagine one of those things after you :-0. Couldn't help but notice there were a lot of fat, unlawfully fragrant people there too; like they were part of it! So, whats this, you fail to think. Well in the spirit of the internet iv'e started my own blog. Out of boredom. Not that I don't have things to be doing right now- like revising for the 9 GCSE exams im destined for next week, but for some reason I'd rather do anything else but that. 'Ey ey, caam daun caam daun..' Liverpool- to see my uncles band 'Haden' in 'The Cavern'. He's fuckin mint on the guitar. And he does well in his hand at the singin! A lot of the stuff was their own, but there was also some oldie rock and roll type stuff, and the darkness! It was perfect :-D and not that I don't like the odd nite away with the family somewheres but I'm glad to be home.  This was post 1. Let's see how long I keep this up for!

      Well today is my first health day thing. I have ate healthily all day, and drank water (apart from a bottle of sprite). I went on what turned out to be a 22.5 mile bike ride with Luke, I took him round where I went a few weeks back- castle eden, Horden Colliery, Blackhall Colliery, and home. But we took a wrong turn in the dene, ended up on a bridge over the A19 and had to go in a big circle to get back where we needed to be to get to Horden.  Who knows what Elliots done. I told Kat this morning about it all, she sed she wanted to join in and do exactly what I'm doing. But she has some stoner parties coming up, so there goes that. And she dosen't eat right at all, so there goes that too. To eat healthily you have to eat EVERY DAY Kat! Oh, and she was off to the Headland carnival today with faye n laura, so there goes the no tabs thing. She has just brought 200 back from Lanzarote. I bet she had candy floss. And something fried in lard. And a toffee apple. Mmmmm toffee apple :-D  Well, today is the day of the b3ta newsletter. Go to b3ta.com and sign up. It's mint. Heres a few things it drew my attention to:  Spoof government site   The actual government site   The greatest ever PC gadget- but oh no- I'm healthy!

      With the help of Elliot, I've came to a decision. I have an unhealthy lifestyle, I think. It could be a LOT unhealthier, but it could also be a lot healthier. So, what am I going to do about it?  For starters, I actually ENJOY the odd cigarette. This is a recent thing. Usually Lambert & Butlers. We all know the effects. It's like self harm. Well, I'll self harm no more, and stop before I'm too addicted and it's too difficult to do so.  I sometimes smoke pot/wacky backy/cannabis or whatever you want to call it. Passing a joint around occasionally when out with certain friends has started to become the 'done' thing. It may be a very fun, sociable activity, but what it all boils down to is smoking a joint does the same harm as 4 cigarettes. It is medically and scientifically proven. So that is stopping too!  Going to bed after 2AM and getting up at 1 or 2PM is no good. It's missing half the day. It's sleeping your life away. It's pointless! I'm going to start getting into a good sleeping routine.  Eating muffins, chocky and biscuits, bags of pork scratchings and drinking fizzy drinks is also practically self harm in my new opinion. From now on- breakfast every day. I'm going to set myself meal times, and stop eating bits and pieces all day. A good, balanced and healthy diet from now on.  And finally, exercise. I ride or walk to practically anywhere I need to be. But from now on, designated exercise mornings and evenings each week are going to be just the job for me. A good long ride on a saturday morning? Walking down town on a sunday for a stroll about the shops and a walk down the marina, where I'll pick up a nice healthy sandwich from that shop that has them nice ice creams. And maybe a half hour of sit-ups and other little such excercises every night. Maybe. I'm not sure if I'm that desperate!  I'm fit and healthy now. But if I continue like I am, well, I wouldn't want to get any more unhealthier or err.. unfit. So, as of today- the 30th of July 2004, I'm going to carry out all that stuff. Elliot is gonna actually get off his arse and start exercising. He's already became a veggie (something I swear I would never want to and will not do) so he eats quite healthily. He hasn't smoked a thing for quite some time. But he really could do with some exercise!   Today has been the usual. We had my cousin again, as I said in the last post. The little sod, pushed loads of rocks into the pond, nearly overflowed the bathroom sink, squashed me rhubarb I've been lovingly tending for quite some time, ran out the house n wudn't come back wen I shouted him (by then I wasn't gonna actually stop him playing on the road). Git.   I did manage to get my aunty on the ole scooter round the fields wen she came up to get him. She didn't know how to ride it, she was screaming wen she was goin down the field at 10mph and me and me mam pissed ourselves laffing.   Then I managed to give my mam a croggie n made her scream and nearly cry in fright. God, woman, wots the matter with you! When she was on by herself she did actually manage to TURN this time. I was quite impressed!  Thats all from me for err, yesterday. Good night my little readerinos. Enjoy scotland, Ste. Going the day after tomorrow, eh? Say hello to Hickers for me. That reminds me, Thursday today wasn't it? Anto has gone to Birmingham :-( deserter! It should be 'once a monkeyhanger, ALWAYS a monkeyhanger!' (and for that you should have to stay in good ole Pools)!  Song of the day: 2-4-6-8 Motorway (Tom Robinson)

      I stayed at my grandads in King Oswy (a part of the town) last night. At precisely 12:15PM yesterday afternoon (I say yesterday, but we are only 2 and a half hours into today)- during the news on channel 4 (oh no big loss there eh?) the power went off. I went home at about 3, thinking that the power would be on at the top of the village which is miles from my grandads. Claverings electric was on (the housing estate inbetween) and the bottom of the village but- my street, no luck. I've been amusing my cousin all day so I didn't have any dire need for electricity, but then he went home. So I went for a ride out on my bike- this is about 7:00PM btw. I discovered, much to my amusement, articles Grrr1, 2 and 3. (Yes, I just happened to have my camera with me).   As we can see, Grrr1 shows that, in the event of a prolonged period of no electricity (thats about once every two months where I live) the mysterious little 'Hartlepool Water Pumping Station' hut near my street (which is on the top of a hill), attracts a little bald man (sadly not in the picture) brandishing a red petrol can and a bag of spanners. So, the little hut gets its own electric, eh?  Grrr2 shows that, in the afore mentioned event, EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT MY STREET OF 7 SEMI-D's (14 houses) gets its own generator. Before our street (they normally just forget about us). The blokes were hooking that generator to about 5 bungalows and 4 street lights, there.  Grrr3 backs up my point. That generator managed to power a whole 300m of street lighting and Mr Davisons farm (who was at the pub with my mam and dad at the time, there was only his wife and a barn full of poultry actually there). At 7:00 some NEDL bloke told me that our gen was coming over from Doncaster and would be installed within the hour.   After boiling water for cups of tea, heating some soup and making some bacon sarnies on our small gas camping stove (see the last picture) by light of some candles and a light I wired to an old car battery I found in the garage, and also after we all went to bed, the electric came back on at 12:15AM (a few hours ago). So then I came on the computer and ridded myself of the electronic cravings that had built up inside me (these were not extinguished by listening to the undertones and some weird 70s punk music on my ancient 'personal' CD player).   Heyyy we have my 5 (or 6?!) year old cousin coming again tomorrow. At half 8 AM! Oh god no I'll have to get up :-(   Oh- some news! I've aquired the Euro Blogs webring. Don't have a clue what I'm on about? Shame. Click 'Euro Blogs' on the right of this post! If you have a blog you european lunatic, join it. Cheers. Bye bye, aurevoir, auf weidersehen- tschoos! (Or something like that)...

      Today has been hot. Probably as hot as it's ever got in Hartlepool. It reminded me of that song, 'Mr Blue Sky' by the Electric Light Orchestra. That's mint, that is. I've been doing the garden all day, and we had a barbie. It looks great!    On another side, I'm angry. I've been waiting to get my CBT (compulsary basic training) for my scooter- so that I'm legally allowed on the roads. Waiting since the 23rd of May when I turned 16. But nooo. Nobody ever answers the phone at the CBT place, nobody phones back and I leave message after message, the one time someone did answer they said 'the man is on holiday'. And it's the only place that does CBT's, unless I go to Newcastle. So I'll phone again tomorrow...    Another thing that's got up my nose lately is the americanisation of everything. It's even shoved in your face. People of Britain, I'd like to educate you. The 'A' in 'AOL' stands for American. It is 'American Online', so don't get AOL. No matter how many free trial CD's they post in your door, no matter how many racks of the afore mentioned CD's you see in every shop, every day, no matter how many adverts you see on telly for 'unlimited broadband only £19.99 a month'! You are not American. Try fairADSL, wannadoo (I know it's French, but still) and even BT is getting quite cheap. You are BRITISH.     Everywhere you turn: Mc Donalds, KFC, Burger King, WalMart (you know it as ASDA), billboards owned by 'ClearChannel' (they tried to take over all of Britains commercial radio stations, but the government stopped them!) Microsoft, NTL (although UK based), and whats that in the distance? It's one of them racks of AOL CD's! Theres been the odd advert on inbetween the AOL adverts on telly, advertising Pizza Hut's 'ice cream factory'. It shows you a friendly old local businessman, driving about in his ice cream van. With no customers. Then it shows you inside Pizza Hut, with all the kids tucking in to their crap. Finally, you see the ice cream van in the scrappers yard. It's the same as on this programme I seen on BBC4, on about how all the local hundreds of years old coffee shops have closed in Spain because 'Starbucks' moved in. I don't know why, but it sickens me. Don't forget to search for 'Ghost Fleet Hartlepool' in google, and you'll see another reason why I have to see America every day.    Mind you, apart from the stereotypical twats you find in many chat rooms online, the Americans are friendly people. Well, some of them are. Sometimes. Well, really- I couldn't give a toss what they were like, I'd just like to stop the Americanisation of the world (call it globalisation if you must), becuase it does my head right in. Eat at your local restaurant! Buy Vauxhalls instead of fords (aye, Vauxhall is probably the least american owned car manufacturer in Britain!) and please try and get broadband from a British company instead of ntl or AOL. Don't even mention how all the call centres have moved/are moving to india (a little off-subject, I know). Thanks. Sorry for the long post!

      4 weeks 4 days to results day. GCSE results day, that is. I have a letter from the college here- my interview is that exact same day- at 2:20PM with Interviewer A. The mysterious and most whimsical of interviewer persons. That will give me about... 4 hours to decide my entire future career path based on what my results are.

      Ok, so I've had a few problems with the site lately but they seem to have mysteriously vanished, likely they've fallen to some grizzly death in some giant black hole in another dimension..    I spent last week at me nana n grandads 'cos me mam n dad were on holiday. I've been out practically every day for the last fortnight, with mates or down the town for a walk about and, the general randomness that sometimes occurs. On the saturday night (my last night down there) I was wanting to stay over at lukes, he had alcohol and his mam n dad were away too. But me nana said she didn't want me to for some reason, (my grandad has no say in things when she's concerned lmao), and I didn't want to argue or present any 'back-chat' like some cheeky young laddy...    This week, I've been out and about every day (apart from today) also. Yeah, filling the time with random trips to here and there, like yesterday we went to the beach- it must have been the hottest day of the year (about 22-24 degrees C :-O) so, in our infinate wisdom, we had a fire. And climed up some sand dunes. And generally made the problem of being miles too hot and weary a lot worse than it deserved to be. And it never rained today. And it only rained yesterday in the evening. The wind sometimes has a warm feel. Summers here! (probably)    So I'm off now, to disappear into the dark. Theres some kind of emergancy down at the hospital, some fire has knocked the power out and they only have 24 hours of stand-by charge or something. My mams on standby incase it fails and all the machines that go bleep and stuff stop working (being a nurse, like she is) so I better free up the phone line...    Good Night England!

      The prom was orite. The limo was amazing. I've never been in a limo before! Wow, it had TV's and champagne and big comfy seats ahh. I went down daves to get picked up by the limo, his Dad took lot's of photos of us all dressed up heh. The food was lush there, but you didn't get much. It was a good night, even though I didn't dance. Heh, well.. I'm not the dancing type. They wouldn't serve alco, and HALF a coke was £1.15. Toss!  Afterwards, Jamie and Dave convinced me to go to Allisters. I was nackered and I couldn't really be arsed, but I went. I got pissed, and that.., and somehow ended up getting a taxi to nowhere in particular and walking home to the village at half 4 in the morning, with Jamie, AJ and Jonny W. We all sat in Jamies kitchen, wrecked. I'm surprised I wasn't really  I'll, or barfin up like AJ, considering the amout of drink I'd had. Hmm, seems instead I've just had to be punished by feeling a bit queer all day. 7AM rolled around, and plans to go to the wind turbine and get more wasted were put to one side as AJ just wanted to go to bed. I did too, really. Everyone went home, and I woke up at 2PM today. My suit stinks of Allahs bonfire.  Jamies Mam gave us a lift to 'Holtfest', a gig down Holy Trinity church in West View- a few different bands were on, people from around and abouts. Including Michael, the hilarious sweaty 15 year old with bouncing man boobies. Heh, glad I went. £2.50, worth it, I'd have only been stuck in the house all night.  It's really fucked up. I got picked up from the PROM, in a LIMO,  TODAY! What the hell! Seems like years ago! Longest and most dodgey day of my life!

If I dont go to Alistars after, I'll have a post right here at 1 AM! I think it's meant to finish at 12:00. 7-12 I think. Meh, who cares...

      Heh 'afore'. Tuesday was yesterday wasn't it... well here we goes.  Dan didn't turn up to the second college induction day. Dan, you cunt. I had photography lessons, chemistry, maths, physics and business studs. All went well. Good teacher people. Didn't notice any chores (or townies, or.. whatever you call 'em). After college.. after tea... after half 7PM I decided I needed to get out. I went on a bike ride, the usual route around the 'Hart to Haswell walkway', which is along the route of an abandoned train track. But, I decided to go all over the place, having a look around wingate and nesbitt hall... and then I went totally off route across a field, and ended up in castle eden dene. Next to Castle Eden... Castle! I haven't been there since me and me mam nd dad used to walk the old dog there, before it died.. when I was like 10 :-O The old place is all done up! No longer a ruin! Well, I got a bit lost, ended up in Horden. Still lost as I've never been in Horden Colliery in my life, I ended up on the beach, miles and miles from home. No phone, dark. Shit. Somehow I peddled like mad and got to blackhall where I was nearly attacked by a bunch of low life wankers, and then I ended up at me grandads where I finished the day off with a big plate of lamb and chips, 'n gravy :-)   Today was, ... I d'no. I feel a bit strange :-S Had maths and physics. Then 'BLOCK F' on the form thing, I was going to do sailing but I ended up staying at the college and following everyone else.. who ended up doing the 'treasure hunt'. All this was was working out clues and going about the college getting different peoples signatures. All very well, but as usual everyone abandoned me and Dave, who's a good mate in a wheelchair. Everyone ALWAYS does it. This time it was Les (Name & Shame- DANIEL FOTHERGILL).. 'here ya go jonny stay with dave *runs off* (whole place suddenly deserted). And one time in particular, on the bus back from Seaton- everyone 'Jonny you take Dave, go on Jonny you get off the bus god Jonny just go, we're going to Ryans'. I'll admit that was a while ago, but nowts changed. I don't mind stayin with dave- at all, its just peoples attitudes. They don't have to get off the bus and they get rid of me- two birds with one stone eh- wasn't it? Come on... what the fucks wrong with everyone? So.. I never got to see the upstairs of the college in the 3 full induction days. The place is like 150 years old or something, and there are no lifts, so couldnt take Dave. At least Grace stayed with us for a while when we found her. Good girl, Grace :-D  My neighbour, over the road was in the Hartlepool Mail again today! This time, on his horse, in a knight outfit thing- even the horse was dressed up. It was about the village fete on Saturday. Fred's a good laugh. And a good bloke. Is in the lifeboat crew and everything! After reading that I looked up to see Fred, and two other neighbours outside with a BIG rainbow trout. Greg & Gary had caught it out fishing.. 16.5lb or something. Impressive. They were pictured for some fishing magazine, and Tom from the Mail is taking some pics in the morning before its put to good use! I'll put sum pics up when I start uploading them..!  It's the prom tomorrow night. Any locals will know where I mean when I say it's at Hardwick Hall. I was going to get there in a limo along with Anto, Ryan, Dan and all them. Turns out I was 'replaced' with some other people.. but never mind. Won't have to see some of those people again after this.. but- that's a shame :-( So, I'm going with Dave, Kat and Sarah and.. some other people lol. Good people. Most the lads seem to be wearing a tux. Oh well, too late now. I'll wear my normal suit.. cheaper though eh? And before you wonder, I'm not 'going' with anyone. Hey I tell ya.. I'm just looking foreward to a good meal! I'm looking foreward to my next post..........

      First day of college induction today. It went orite. Nice chippy nearby. Weird, the first two lessons I had were business studies! With MR Smedley (my business studs teacher from schools husband)! and he knew my name :-O probs because he's drove me to the metro centre, done business studs revision classes with MRS. S., and that...  As I say, a good chippy. I can see myself settling in nicely there. They didn't have a box of them little wooden forks you use to stab ur chip wrapper with when you're done though, which was mildly appalling. I also had a photography and chemistry lesson, I like the kinda laid back feel round the place. Meh, more about this tomorrow.  Tonight me mam was putting cable tidies on the wires round the back of the telly. I handed her some scissors to cut the left over bit of tubeing off the end.. and she cut through the live cable to the video. Hmm, big explosion, bad smell, lights flickered, metal scissor blades had a HOLE in them, she shit herself practically and sat there in shock. Remember to always check what you are cutting through before putting scissors to use, kids. Anyway, I put a new fuse in the plug, soldered a new cable to the board inside the video, put new fuses on the board, screwed it all back together (2 hours work)- it's 18 year old! Should have seen the DUST :-O Yeah it's working fine now :-)  Ummm, more about whatever tomorrow or some other day. For now, go  urlLink join the new european (german british french austrian albanian spanish greek etc. ya know, European)! teen blog blogring webring thing  and, I'll.. see ya!

      It has pissed down for two days solid. The Hartlepool 'Maritime Festival' must have been 'great'... yesterday was my Grandads 72nd. I nipped down, said my congrats, put his new lawnmower together and had some Panackilty. My aunty and 5 year old cousin came. She was shouting at him as usual, and he was hitting me with stuff. Not sure what. On the night, well- me mam and dad had gone for a night in the lakes and some walking- in the rain! so I had the house to myself. Jamie came up and we had a drink and some greasy takeaway from Veronas down Throston. I then proceeded to...  ...stay up until 5AM this morning, planning a new webring.  And I've made it, 'euroteen'. Theres the link, over there on the right! If you have a site, and are 14-20 years old from europe, then join it. Go on go on go on go on!  urlLink Go to the site.  It's new and I'll improve it later..  Tomorrow I have to be at college for 9:45. I woke up at half 2 PM today, I'm gonna have problems! It's the first of the 3 upcoming induction days, and then on Thursday is the prom. I'm not that bothered about going to the prom. Somewhere to go and something to do for a night I suppose though, and I've paid...

      What a shit day. Lately has been very shit. Ok- I was great for 2 days after I finished my exams. Now im just depressed. Not attention seeking- depressed, like some people, more like I'm miserable. Looka this- if anyone remembers Ste's thesecondlife.tk then, well the similarities are a tad scary. Im just bored. And today we went to see a certain great-nanna who I haven't seen for ages. She was 86 the other day. Blah blahdy blah... old age is gonna get everyone in my family :-(   Meh, I've also 'fell out' with a lot of people lately, so it would seem. Bollocks :-( I want anti-depressants like Patten had. Hmf.. aven't seen him for about a month, either :-(  I stayed up till 4:30AM this morning with Luke on MSN. That is only 1 of the maybe 2 or 3  meaningful and decent conversation I've had with anyone on this infernal piece of techno-shit, this year :-(  Ffs, I'm just depressed.

      Woo! Those kind google folk who took over blogger.. invited me to use Gmail! And I'm surprised to say- - - it's BRILLIANT! Everything takes no time at all to load, you don't have to wait for graphics and fancy fucklings to load up- becuase it's all nice and basic and has the bare necessities. And I love it. Each and every of the 1,000Mb of it. Feel free to send me a disgruntled and forced congradulations on (the title of this blog) @gmail.com. Yeah. Woo. Wa-hey. I think I shall sign up for a .NET passport and use it as my MSN account!  Nobodys got back to me *YET* about jobs. And I'm still to go ask down the pub. We'll see, said the blind man...

      Ok so the healthyness thing totally failed. I slept out in Kats back garden the other night, broke every rule. Also broke every rule of it last night when I slept round Jamies. But I didn't sleep. None of us did.  Yesterday I also ran into a bus stop pole in the mist and hurt my shoulder, at about 2 AM. Then the poliece took me name, address and D.O.B. for hanging around in the middle of a roundabout at half 3 AM. But it was a good night.  It's Friday again, where's the week gone? I've just had another power cut, this one was only 4 hours, not as bad as last time! They could at least try and predict when a fault will develop heheh. I'm off now, very tired.
