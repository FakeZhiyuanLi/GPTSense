          S  o... The other night, I promised a posting about the documentary  " urlLink  Vinyl  ".     The film, by Alan Zweig, examines the obsession for collecting vinyl records. Alan, a confirmed vinyl obsessive, take us on a field-trip through the lives and homes of various fellow vinyl-collectors. It is fascinating on one level, and downright sad, on many other levels.    First of all, most of the collectors live in homes and lives governed by piles and piles of records. One describes his nightly ritual of moving boxes and boxes of records from off and in front of his bed. Then there are: the guy who has memorized every K-tel playlist, the guy attempting to collect every record ever made, the guy who had played every record he owns in alphabetical order.... over 4 years. The list goes on.    There is, perhaps a sense of "thank God that isn't me" that rises up in the viewer -- as well as a little envy Or maybe that's just me. I have to admit that I have a record collection, as well. Mine, however, fills only 6 milk crates (rather ubiquitous to anyone who had LPs in the 70s and 80s) -- miniscule compared to the guy who has half a million records in his 2-bedroom apartment!    Ironically, when I first flipped to the station, the first guy who was being interviewed was sheepishly admitting to having thrown out a huge collection of records when his brother was set to move in with him.... He didn't want to know that someone else had his records. Why ironic? This was Geoff Pevere being interviewed. Geoff, respected film critic and co-author of "Mondo Canuck". The brother was Bob, my best buddy in college.    The sight of Geoff and a friend turfing crate after crate, after crate of LPs into a dumpster made me nearly weep.    You see, my collection was doubled, back in the mid-80s when my brother bought out the stock of a defunct record store. He opened the door to the warehouse and said "Take as many as you want!" I took over 100... restraining myself, somehow, from taking the whole lot.    While a lot of the stock was 80s Pop music, which I loathe, I did find a lot of European EPs, dance, New Wave, and Japanese stuff. There were also collector editions, shape and picture LPs, including Meatloaf's "Bat Out of Hell" and a Michael Jackson Limited Edition, 9-pack of singles pressed on red vinyl (from "Don't Stop 'Til You Get It" to "Thriller". MJ from black to white.). I had high hopes of this making me some big money (though I hated MJ even before he became a pedophile). Sadly, those hopes have been dashed as he heads slowly and surely towards Segregation at a penitentiary.    "Vinyl" is available on   urlLink  video   . I highly recommend it.

        I just got us a satellite dish. This, in itself is pretty cool. However, there is the old adage that the more choice one has, the harder it is to find something that actually interests one. This applies to everything from restaurant menus to clothing to television.       The fact is, I have been flipping thru channels the last few days and either finding nothing that I WANT to watch, or finding something that I WANT to watch, only to find that the schedule is fucked up and whatever isn't really on. Tonight, for instance, I was flipping thru the program menu. I came across something called "  urlLink  Amish in the City   ". Is this a documentary? Is it a drama? ... a comedy? ..."reality TV? I don't know, because, while the show was supposed to be on, what WAS on appeared to be another of those fucking "reality TV" things about teens in an apartment.         So, I flipped to the "Info" feature and I read "Amish experience the tradition of rumspringa". First of all, this isn't info, as I have no idea what the fuck "rumspringa" is. That is fine. I can look it up, but I shouldn't have to. It turns out that the program is, indeed, a reality TV show, about Amish teens in the city, living in an apartment, with a bunch of "city teens".        "AMISH IN THE CITY will provide a unique look into the Amish journey of discovery, known as rumspringa, through a group of young adults who have left their spiritually devout, rural communities to experience life in the big city.    In subsequent episodes, the show will follow the stories of the five Amish young adults and their six roommates from diverse backgrounds as they learn to live with each other in the Hollywood Hills. The show will chronicle how relationships develop and viewpoints collide in a house shared by young people from very different cultures, while also introducing viewers to the intensely personal Amish coming-of-age experience, called rumspringa.  From moments serious and significant to lighter and trivial, cameras catch everything as the Amish journey outside their quiet rural areas and are gradually introduced to both the delights and challenges of modern metropolitan life."         I won't go into the fact that living in a big house in the Hollywood Hills is hardly going to give these kids an idea of real life and a life that most urban kids live....    The point is that out of 200 channels, 150 have "reality shows" of the same ilk, and I am really pissed off. Being pissed off has inspired me to do a blog about my TV-watching adventures. This is actually pretty inspired (at least I think so) since I have no life, and I spend most of my time on the computer and watching TV.... simultaneously. Is it any wonder that I never get to bed at anything CLOSE to a reasonable hour????    The good news is that I flipped right past this little "gem" and happened on a documentary called "Vinyl", which as the title suggests, about records. More accurately, it is about people who collect records, some passionately and others obsessively. Since I have a modest vinyl collection, it struck me as particularly interesting. What was more interesting was that I happened to tune in just at the beginning of an interview with an acquaintance, the brother of a good friend from college, Geoff Pevere. Geoff is a movie critic, and has co-written a book called "Mondo Canuck".    I will devote another entry to this program.    Oh! And my TV is dying. I am surprised it has lasted the weekend. SIGHHHHH.....    *Rumspringa: a time in which Amish youth leave their cloistered lifestyle and explore the world. The translation is, essentially, "running wild".

         British Journalist Killed by Israeli Troops in Gaza Strip    British television journalist James Miller died after being shot by Israeli troops in the southern town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. An Israeli army spokesman expressed "regret" at the death, but pointed out that the man had "taken great risks by being in a virtual war zone."   Miller, 35, was hit as he was filming a stand-up segment as part of a documentary he was making on the army's destruction of hundreds of homes of militants in the Palestinian territories.   A photo handed out May 3, 2003 shows freelance British cameraman James Miller a day before he was killed by Israeli gunfire in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip.   He was struck in the back of the neck, said Ali Mussa, director of the hospital in Rafah, near the Israeli-Egyptian border. After receiving first aid at an army post near where the shooting took place, Miller was evacuated to the Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba by an army helicopter, military officials told AFP.   They said Israeli soldiers were operating in the area to bust a weapons smuggling ring operating from Egypt to the Palestinian sector.   The Israeli troops were in a house close to the border, where they had found a tunnel exit, when they came under fire from small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. After returning fire the soldiers searched the area and came across a woman waving a white flag and who pointed out the journalist lying wounded in the street.   His death brings to 3,207 the number of people killed since the Palestinian intifada, or uprising, broke out in September 2000, including 2,419 Palestinians and 729 Israelis.   He is also the fourth journalist killed by Israeli troops during that period.   The most recent death was that of Nazeh Daruwazi, a 42-year-old cameraman for the US news agency Associated Press, killed as he was covering clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Nablus.   On March 16, a 23-year-old peace activist from the United States was crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip as she was acting as a human shield to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian house.   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Friday that authorities are considering expelling foreign peace activists acting as human shields.   Top Israeli brass and foreign ministry officials met this week to discuss the means of expelling the activists, the newspaper reported. A foreign ministry spokesman confirmed that meetings had been held but said no decision had yet been reached.   "We discussed the issue of these so-called pacifists, who are in closed military zones where they are not allowed and are putting their own lives at risk," the spokesman told AFP.

        urlLink   Canada Day     (  urlLink   July 1    ) is coming up. Unfortunately, I will be in   urlLink   Thunder Bay    . Otherwise, I would be out enjoying the official celebrations, here in   urlLink   Ottawa    . Usually, I spend the day out and about downtown. In the evening, however, I usually stay home or go and watch the fireworks away from the crowds.   While I haven't experienced anything as "exciting" as   urlLink   Edmonton's     "  urlLink   Canada Day Riot    " of 2001, there is nothing I enjoy more than being jostled by a bunch of drunken       urlLink   louts     and then having to wait for three hours for a bus.   Canada prepares for its   urlLink   Federal Election     .  Here is the   urlLink   Globe and Mail     "Decision 2004" page.   I voted in the Advance Poll. This time, I voted   urlLink   NDP    .

Tonights artists are:   urlLink  Buck 65    urlLink        "This turntable kills Fascists...  urlLink  Woody   would have wanted it that way." Buck 65 has a sort of Blues/Rap/Dub/ urlLink  Tom Waits   sound.....    and   urlLink  Rob Lutes    urlLink         Rob recommends  urlLink  Creative Radio Central  ,   an online radio station which is featuring  urlLink  Blackie and the Rodeo Kings  . My personal favorite song from the newest Rodeo Kings CD,  urlLink  Bark  , is " urlLink  Stoned  ". Now THAT is a "road tune"!

        The sky was so beautiful, this evening. I wish I had been able to run home for my camera. Unfortunately, I was running late, and by the time I was on my way home, the show was over.   It had been intermittently cloudy and sunny today. At sunset, huge, dense, white clouds were starting to boil up in the east. To the west, were big black storm-clouds. To the south, flat, dissipating clouds. The ones to the east were tinted with pink and gold from the sunset. The ones to the south were black and red.   The whole scene reminded me of what I once heard described as "an almighty sky".   There was a painter who used to have a show on TV many years ago. I wish I could recall his name. He used to have an instructional show on oil-painting of the "starving artist" genre. However, he was so exuberant that one was almost impressed with the paintings. He used to refer to various elements in his paintings as "an almighty mountian" or "an almighty tree".   Hence, tonight's sky being and "almighty sky".

        Mom and I went to visit my friends from   urlLink  Kosovo      last night.   We haven't seen them in almost two years, I am guessing and I was feeling very badly. We met when our     urlLink  Fellowship   &nbsp;sponsored the family as refugees from the   urlLink  war in Kosovo   . We all became friends as well as sponsors and were torn when half the family went back to Kosovo. We were saddened further when Qamille, the grandmother of the family died a few months after returning to   urlLink  Pristina   , their home.   However, before the family left, the son and his wife had their first child, Kosovare. In fact, I was there for the birth, giving me the chance to have the most memorable experience in my life.   The eldest daughter returned home to Kosovo a little later, and gradually we lost touch. The family here, though, was growing. Another child was on the way. Sadly, Altina was born at 16 weeks, and despite a valiant struggle for life, she died months later, at about the date she should have been born, had fate not intervened. It was heartbreaking for all of us who felt so close to the family. It was devastating to see the impact on the young parents.   According to   urlLink  Muslim tradition   , there is a lengthy preparation before the funeral and the preparations are carried out by members of the Muslim community, friends and family. The preparations include the washing of the body and wrapping it in a winding cloth. I was really honored to participate in the preparations. For me, the fact that I had seen one of their daughters into the world, I felt that I should be there to help another out of the world. It was sad and beautiful, and gave be the chance to experience another facet of life that all of us face but rarely so closely, at least in our Western Christianize culture.   I saw the family several times after this, but one thing and another kept us apart.   On our last visit, I played with Kosovare, then aged 2. We watched the air-balloons go by... one crashed on the side of the building, and we had a lovely time. However, I was conscious that this was our first visit as friends and, yet, despite our being so easy with the family as their sponsors and considering ourselves to be friends, I didn't want them to feel obligated to be friends.   Last week, I got an email from Advije in Kosovo, updating me on her life and that of her family. She has a 9-month-old son named Andi. The family is well, and all was well. She also told me that the young couple here had another baby. I was thrilled, though sad that I hadn't been able to participate in the birth this time around.   I called Agron and Nexmije and Mom and I went to visit. It was a terrific visit, not the least because of the presence of Klevis, two weeks old. I found that our relationship is firmly that of dear friends and I needn't have worried about them feeling "obligated" to be friends. We are and it is wonderful.   Nexmije said that she regretted my not having been with her for the birth. They had tried to call, but didn't have me new phone number and my old cellphone was no longer working. Ah well, Klevis is hearty and healthy, and that is all that counts. As you can see below, he is a beautiful, beautiful baby.     urlLink      Klevis, age 2 weeks

         This morning on the CBC radio program "Next", I was listening to an by Nora Young&nbsp;interview with Michael Braungart, co-founder of the company  urlLink  MBDC   "a product and process design firm dedicated to transforming the design of products, processes, and services worldwide."         He was talking about " urlLink  cradle to cradle design  ", which is something I had not heard about before.       urlLink      Cradle to Cradle    Basically, cradle to cradle design uses "eco-effective" processes and designs to produce products which, rather than being simply "recycleable", are entirely recoverable or not only create no impact on the environment, actually improve the environment. Two examples that he referred to were  urlLink  Unilever  , which has ice-cream packaging created from leaf-litter which not only bio-degrades in just a few hours, incorporates seeds from rare plants; and the Ford Motor Company which has introduced the  urlLink  Model U  , produced using green materials and processes like soy-based componants and corn-based fillers in its tires, as well as green technologies, such as a revolutionary  urlLink  Hydrogen Internal-Combustion Engine   which producess pollutant emissions at near zero (including carbon dioxide).         In fact, Ford is working towards a vehicle with a 5-year life span, at which point, Ford would accept back the entire vehicle. The vehicle then would then be dissolved in a solvent, the polymers recovered, and resued in the creation of new vehicles. Certainly, a revolutionary concept. The test, of course would be with the consumer.     &nbsp;

Star Axis is an immense star observatory being&nbsp;created in New Mexico.   The artist, Charles Ross, is digging into a mesa to create his naked-eye observatory, a monumental work which is inspired by the ancient observatories of the peoples of the American Southwest, amongst others.The subject of Charles Ross’ art is light itself. Using sunlight and starlight as its source, the work manifests experiences of primal solar color, and star geometry in sculptural form. Ross’ work includes photographs, paintings and drawings, site-specific prism/solar spectrum light installations, Star Maps,  urlLink  Solar Burns, and his enormous earth/sky sculpture and naked-eye observatory, Star Axis.

Canada is sending 266 athletes, which is a smaller number than went to the Moscow Summer Games, which was largly boycotted. Never let it be said that Canada doesn't want to push the boat out, because they are sending 270 support staff..... That is more than one per athlete.      &nbsp;   It isn't, however, sending many top athletes, because it set impossibly hard criteria for qualiification. Athletes must be in the top 12 in the world.

        I went out to the drugstore this evening. I meant only to be a few minutes, but it was the kind of night that demanded a road-trip.         The sun had more or less set by the time I got my shopping done. I cranked open the window and cranked up the music and headed out. I didn't have a real idea of where I wanted to go, but I think that was the point.          A few weeks ago, I made myself a "Driving Music" CD. The first song, "  urlLink  Stoned   " by Blackie and the Rodeo Kings (I've mentioned them before). I must have played that 10 times before moving on to the next tune. Actually, I played a number of tunes several times, and that was just fine. Let's see.... "I Can't Stand the Rain", "Summertime" and "Take a Little Piece of My Heart" by Janis Joplin; "Memories of East Texas" by   urlLink  Michelle Shocked   ; "Joan of Arc" and "Song of Bernadette"   urlLink  Jennifer Warnes    (Leonard Cohen songs); "Peter's Dream" by   urlLink  Lennie Gallant    (Even though the tune was written by Gallant, my friend Chris Angel does it better. Unfortunately his version hasn't been recorded, yet); "Chelsea Morning" by Joni Mitchell; and "Barracuda" by Heart.          Because of all the rain we've had over the last while, the air has a very musty smell to it, which wasn't the most pleasant part of the drive. Still, it was the first time in a long while that I have gotten out of the house, on my own, just to drive, something I relish. In one respect, I really enjoyed it, but I think it would have been more satisfying to have someone along for the ride.         I think back to the days when a couple of friends and I would pile in the car, smoke a few joints, and just drive. I think I miss that. Actually, it's about the only thing I DO miss from my teens and early 20s. Aside from the sense of freedom I had with a few close friends, they were pretty shitty times for me. I do miss the driving around with no place particular to go, though. I miss a few of those friends, too.         I started thinking about who, in my circle of friends today, would be my choice of driving-around friend. I hate to say it, but I can't think of anyone who is free to just pick up and go out, anymore. Everyone either has family obligations or would think it was a nuts idea. "You want to WHAT?...."         Siggghhh.
