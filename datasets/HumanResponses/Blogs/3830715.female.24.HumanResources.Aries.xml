       As I still have time till I'm flying away (4th of August) I'm meeting with my friends in smaller groups.  After my master exam, full of new energy together with Agnieszka and Monika (known as Jesien) we decided to come together and drink for all of us having finished studies. And so we went to Monika's place and had a "private party" there. Some of us had morning problems, but how many times you are drinking for your masters :P  Some time later we had Fresco Team meeting. (If anybody needs explanation on that issue, please, write me an e-mail). Maja and Kamila came to me and it was another night of gossiping with our beloved Fresco. Maja even made a protocol of this meeting :) so more info some of you might find in LCs' chronicle.  And last Sunday I went to Renatka's place and had my private bye-bye as she promised me to have. After some time of girl-talk Kobza joined us and the topics changed a bit, but still it was fun.  It's sooo great to meet these people, talk to them, ... I know I will not have that chance for some time and I already miss that.  But still to come is our EB 2001/2002 meeting!!  I just can't wait till the weekend as we'll go to Chajdi's summer house next to fake lake. We didn't have such meeting for a long time.

       Yesterday I had my bye-bye party. My buddy - Monique prepared it and we were saying goodbye also to her another SN - Bartek, who is going to Colombia and to Marta, our ex-VP, who is going to Magdeburg (Germany) for a CEED. So many people came. I was really positively estonished. People not only from AIESEC, like Monika and Agnieszka from my high school, also Bartek invited some of his "normal" friends, @ Dinosours like Gosia, Honoratka, Justyna, Kobzik, my EB members - Elvis and Leslaw, trainees and of course a lot of people who are still actively joining each party. I had a chance to talk to people with whom I didn't have much contact recently (I hope this will change) and I must tell you that gossiping with them was something I was missing.  I got a great bye-bey package - THANK YOU VERY MUCH. It's really great to experience something you were once preparing for other people. And reading all the things people wrote in my Blue Bye-Bye Notebook (another great piece of Maja's work) made my eyes go a bit wet. I'm sure that this together with all sugar cubes I got throughout my AIESEC life will brighten my day when I need that. I  think I didn't realise the power of simple words untill now. Untill the moment of really leaving one part of my AIESEC experience behind.  I wish all AIESECers to feel that someday. It's a great start of a new chapter called traineeship.

           Finally I’m here. In  Hungary ,   Budapest  . And I managed to reach some place with internet connection – Mike’s office.         What has happened till now? We moved into the new appartment, spent two days arranging stuff in our place, went sailing on Balaton.         The appartment is great. One room (with kichten and bathroom), on sixth floor in 5 th  district. 5 minutes walk away is the  Danube  river and the Parliament. So the surroundings are just perfect. I didn’t have much time yet to walk around and discover sites in   Budapest  . For sure I’ll do that soon.         The city seems to be perfect. Breathtaking buildings not only on Buda side of the city, small streets and big avenue, monuments, parks, fountains, … People are very nice, everybody sais hallo and helps you open the door. The weather is a bit too hot for me but I’m managing. Language is still a challenge for me but I’d really like to learn at least the basics. I already began and I know some words like “good morning”, “thank you”, “excuse me”, “I don’t know” and I can count to 5.         Although I’m not a great fun of sailing I really enjoyed the weekend we spent with some friends (Tom – Polish guy living in Canada, after a traineeship in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Emoke – his Hungarian friend, Steve – Canadian guy, Aldona – from Katowice AE and Monika – her Polish friend from work). We had a great boat ( 10 meters  long) with all the necessary equipnet plus some extra things that make sailing easier and more fun. We tasted some Hungarian wine during wine festival in Balatonfured, got some suntan (me even sunburn, as always) and had great time sailing. We took over 150 pictures that weekend.          This would be all for now.
