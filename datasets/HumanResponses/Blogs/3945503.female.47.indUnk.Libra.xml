      The technology for aging reversal has been with us for many years. But it is so scattered in so many fields that it takes a generalist to pull it all together. Each Researcher claims that his way is the only way. We have found that it takes a combination of many answers to have a truly unified workable solution to the condition. &nbsp; What is aging? It is the gradual breakdown of body systems and processes. &nbsp; Dr. Christiaan Rarnard, the South African Surgeon who pioneered heart transplant surgery, had his patient's old hearts brought in to them the third day after surgery. They examined them through a glass container. The old hearts were 70% to 90% non-functional fibroid tissue. They should have been 100% healthy, powerful muscles. How did this happen? Your body builds new cells all your life. The blueprint for new cells DNA (Dioxynucleic Acid) gets worn, the body then creates sloppy cells, imperfect cells, aging cells. DNA is the blueprint and RNA is the delivery system, the combination is called RNA-DNA. &nbsp; It's a little like cutting a hundred dresses one at a time, from a flimsy paper parrern. Long before you cut the one hundredth dress from that pattern, the pattern has been nipped in places and trimmed off in others and is scarcely recognizable. The same holds true for the cells created from a worn DNA blueprint. You are literally building your body older, cell by cell! That, plus improper nutrition, (not enough good materials to build good cells with) is what aging is about. &nbsp; When your pattern for new cells gets worn, your skin loses moisture and elasticity. Age spots form on the hands, then later on the face and arms. You have a problem with energy. Good restful sleep eludes you. Calluses from on the soles of the feet. Warty keratoses form (fibrous wart-like growths) usually on the hands and arms. Muscle strength and integrity diminishes. You build nonfunctional fibroid tissue in vital organs e.g. the heart, kidneys, lungs, etc. Loss of memory, impaired hearing, lowered sense of taste and degenerating vision are other symptoms. No wonder your zest for life is gone! Sounds pretty final, pretty grim, doesn't it?  &nbsp; The good news is that most of the above are fully or partially reversible. You simply add the missing ingredients, fresh DNA and RNA. DNA is the blueprint and RNA is the carrier that brings the blueprint to the cells. You add an excellent vitamin/mineral combination. &nbsp; Suddenlt Slender, The Body Wrap RNA-DNA and supplements work to our specifications. They are made by respected vitamin houses that have been manufacturing quality products for&nbsp;Suddenly Slender&nbsp;for years. &nbsp; When you take RNA-DNA somewhere between the second to tenth day you get an abundance of calm, coping, feel good energy, not nervous, diet pill energy. This is when you find yourself cleaning out closets that haven't seen the light of day for years. Great if you want to drop a few pounds or improve your fitness level. &nbsp; Interestingly enough if you are too thin and can't gain weight you should be taking RNA-DNA and a good vitamin/mineral. We recommend Mega-One 75, a Suddenly Slender product. The too thin seem to finally be able to put on some weight. It is definitely a normalizer! Too thin, you gain. Too heavy, you lose. &nbsp; If you are overweight, excess weight comes off more easily. It's easy to lose weight if you have energy. Not many calories get burned while you're "resting" or sitting down because you are exhausted. &nbsp; Within a week you usually notice a difference in your facial tightness. Also if your skin is too dry, the moisture level increases. If it is too oily, the oil level declines and the moisture increases. Skin that drips oil is the body's attempt to correct lack of moisture. Skin tightens visibly. It doesn't tighten skin enough to erase deep lines but the little ones visibly diminish and the deep ones begin to smooth out. Within three months the average person under fifty will look five to ten years younger (judging by the skin of the face). Over fifty the results are even more dramatic.  &nbsp; When you introduce fresh RNA-DNA into the body it begins to build genetically perfect cells. You are building your body visibly younger instead of older! &nbsp; An improvement in muscle strength and endurance are other benefits. RNA-DNA is a major tool in looking younger. &nbsp; If you would like to learn more about anti aging, Suddenly Slender, or find a Suddenly Slender Licensee in your area go to: &nbsp;  urlLink http://www.inchawaybodywrap.com  &nbsp; Invite to join our Yahoo Group "tightenskin"  &nbsp;  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tightenskin  &nbsp; Patricia Pigott Suddenly Slender Licensee &nbsp; &nbsp;

      First I would like to tell you about my Mentor, Victoria Morton so you can see why I reguard her so highly when it comes to skin care.  &nbsp; Having taught herself how to read before she was three years old, Ms. Morton has voraciously read no less than a dozen books per week throughout her life with primary interests in science, physiology, chemistry, nutrition and...science fiction. She says that science fiction stretches the mind. Ms. Morton has managed to cure herself and has survived bouts with malaria, polio, rickets, frequent pneumonia and bronchitis, mostly with her own remedies, which she researched and created....even as a child. &nbsp; A member of the Rockwell family, a great-cousin of Norman Rockwell, the painter, Ms. Morton created her first invention when she was just 8 years old. The Rockwell family, according to "The Book of Rockwell," is known to have the largest number of inventors and artists of any family in the world. &nbsp; Victoria Morton is the CEO of VMM Enterprises, Inc. Additionally, she is on the Board of Directors of Pyramid, Inc., Hot Ticket, Inc., Suddenly Slender International, Inc., Personal Beauty Unlimited, Inc., Suddenly Nourished, Inc., Equi-tox USA, Inc.,Pyramid Consulting &amp; Investment Corporation and Founder of the Research Foundation for Biochemistry and Nutrition Corporation. Ms. Morton is on the Board of Advisore of ABLE, Inc. &nbsp; From Suddenly Slender, The Body Wrap's International Headquarters, Ms. Morton has been writing and editing six books she has written on the various aspects of health and beauty. Recently published, the first book is titled "Aging Reversal, A Reality" and "A Water Retainer's Survival Handbook." &nbsp; Suddenly Slender, The Body Wrap was created in 1969 by Ms. Morton to resolve her own weight and water retention problems. A testimony to her own invention, Ms. Morton has a better figure now, over thirty years later, than she did at 34 years of age. &nbsp; Ms. Morton is also the creator of the "It's All You" Bra that increases, tightens and improves bustlines through comfortable daily wear. &nbsp; Ms. Morton has formulated over 60 different products to enhance or correct nutrition, energy, weight loss, aging-reversal and fluid imbalance, which she markets worldwide and are all part of the Suddenly Slender System. &nbsp; I got to see Victoria a couple of times in February of this year. If you read this and do the math, you will get an idea on Victoria's age. I am here to tell you now, there is no lady on this earth with legs any more beautiful than Victoria's. This lady is amazing. A great testimony herself to the services and products of Suddenly Slender, as are most of the Suddenly Slender Licensees and Techs. that use this service. &nbsp; Patricia Pigott Body Wrap Specialist Suddenly Slender Licensee and owner of: Inch Away Body Wrap  urlLink http://www.inchawaybodywrap.com  &nbsp; Invite to join our Yahoo Group "Tighten Skin"  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tightenskin  &nbsp; &nbsp;
