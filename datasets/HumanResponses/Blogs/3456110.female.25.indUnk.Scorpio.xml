      I really really should put clothes on, I should get up...  All in due time  Seems it gets harder for me everyday to actually get up.  The heat is so bad I slept nearly nude last night, very unlike me to not sleep under a sheet or blanket or something.    So as I laid there in nothing but my underwear, I slept on my chest to prevent exposing my chest.     I kept thinking about how unfair some things are.     You walk in on your daughter wearing nothing but a pair of boys breifs, tell her to get some clothes on and wonder where she got the breifs.      Walk in on your son wearing nothing but a pair of panties, it's time for a long chat and probably throw "him" out of the house.  Why?  Why do we have to veiw femininity as so inferior, why's being girly so wrong?  Society sucks sometimes

      I wanna learn to cook more things.   I wanna be impressive at it too.    I'll have to learn to eat more things though, I wanna cook homecooked stuff, make some big meal and have everyone ooo and ahh at what I created rather than just hamburger helper and stuff.    But it seems the only foods I like to eat are the easy to do stuff.   I could make fresh breads and cookies and things, but that will have to wait till fall.  Too hot to bake right now.   Thinking of learning to make some pasta dishes, have to find some sauces I'm not afraid to eat.  I wish I could make things better for my freinds.  Especially Misty, If nothing else give her the confidence to stand up for herself.  Should I tell Alex about myself.   Part of me really wants to, but I don't know that I could trust him.   Part of me wants to tell Andrea but while I think I could trust her, I'm not sure how she'd react and I'm not sure how she'd feel about me thing.   But then again I don't wanna build a relationship on a lie.

      Had fun, wasn't really singing well tonight.     Misty was disappointed, Alex didn't seem to be paying much attention to her and eddy was bugging her by phone so me and her kinda got into it.    But it was nothing we'll still be friends.  I think alot of people there tonight decided I'm gay, especially the lesbians there.    Not really caring right now, tomarrow I probably will though.  It's 2am now, and I shoulda gone straight to bed, I'll be tired tomarrow but don't really care.    At least now days I have a reason to look forward to work.   :)    Wonder what she thinks of me.    Ok, I gotta stop thinking like, she's just another girl, only thing that keeps bringing her to my mind is the question of what's going on.

      I don't know how bady I messed things up with Andrea yesterday.    I'm sure it confused her, and I'm confused by her.       I touched her hand, it was a mistake, she recoiled  and made it known she knew i'd like to hold her hand.    I decided to give her space so I sat apart from her at break.     Now I regret that.   She did at least make the move to come ask me if i was ok, and sit by me.    So now what?    I can't ask her out, it's already been confired that she won't date coworkers so what happens now?     I'm not sure i can be just her friend anymore.

      Strange stressful day,   Misty was happy, looks like her and Alex might finally happen.    Then she wound up fighting with asshole, I'm still worried about her, hope she's ok.  Alex really seems to want to know about me.   At this point I just wish I knew why.   I'd almost tell him just to find out the real reason he wants to know.   When it becomes need to know information I'll tell him.    For now, he doesn't need to know, living with Misty he'll need to know.  Andrea obviously wants to be freinds, I hope I can move past any feelings and become her friend.     Blog, strange thing this is, who knows how long I'll do it.

      Went to Stillwater today, took Tim to get his crankshaft turned and got my hair straightened.   So much happier about my hair now.   I feel prettier.   I love it.       Misty said she'd help me with my makeup, I don't know that it will really happen but I'm praying.   Shannon said she'd go shopping with me for clothes.   If I could just look like a girl, even for just a moment, I'd be so happy.     Just the look of my hair now has made me much happier and the hope that my freinds will help me.  Bought a Racing wheel for Tim's playstation, I doubt I'll get much use out of it, I just really wanted to buy it.   It's pretty cool, very sensitive.   Hope they enjoy it.

      Things lately have just been, well, weird.  All I want is someone to love me.   To be interested in me, attracted to me, and desire to spend time with me.    It's what I've always longed for.         I really do seem to be doing better last few days than the funk I was in.       If this post seems kinda pointless to readers it's becuase I didn't have a point, other than the desire to post something and the desire not to be moppy about it.

      Even totally exhausted I tried to go to bed early and couln't.    And still got up at 7am.   So I got less than 8 hours.   Still more than I typically get, but I wanted to catch up.     People make alot of references to my gender every day, it rarely bothers me, so why did Andrea excluding me hurt so badely.    I think it was more the being excluded for something that's not my fault than for the gender reference.       I wish I could have explained to her.    No, this blog isn't entertaining.    I was reading about making your blog entertaining and not about complaining about personal life.    That's not the point here.    This is electronic therapy.       Oh well, I doubt anyone is reading this anyways.  There's little I can do about who I am.   So I need to learn to deal with these things.    Need to dwell on good things, stop focusing on the bad.      I tend to forget the good things even happened.     That's my goal for today, remember the good forget the bad.

      Yesterday was fun, worked half day of OT, and wondered what I was gonna do with my time until Karaoke.  When all of a sudden, Mike shows up out of nowhere.   We ate pizza we talked we hung out, it was good.     Then I went to Misty's.   She said she wasn't going to Karaoke, cuz she was going to Bowling with Shawn.   So I kill more time and hit the club,   first one there, then suddenly James and Misty show up.  Nothing wrong, they just wrapped up early so she came out.  It was a blast, Misty, everyone was having more fun than we'd had in some time.   Misty was so happy.   Then eddy started harassing her.  I don't wanna get outta bed....too tired, it's too bright  Oh well better take a quick bath

      Won't see Andrea till Tuesday, guess that doesn't bother her.    Did only one song at Karaoke, Creed - My Own Prison.   The place was very crowded with people I didn't know, and I just wound up gettting bored and in a bad mood.  Yes it bothers me that Misty never compliments me.   "OOooo He's really good" "Oh, She's really good." "AHhhh Alex is so perfect he can't do anything wrong."     "You can't sing depressing music in a place with this many drunk people, gotta have something with a beat."   I guess I just feel that someone who I feel is my best freind should be more approving of me.  If I say anything like this she'll start thinking I wanna be more than freinds again and push me away.   That's not what I want, I just want a friend.   I still need her as my friend.  I guess all in the dangers of having female freinds as a lesbian.   I was trying not to let misty catch me admiring Deanna's body last night.   We're supposed to hate her.   There was some bit of sexual interest as I looked, and some bit of jealous.   God she's got a tight stomach.    No breasts to speak of, but heck, I'm jealous of even those tiny things.

      Andrea is driving me nuts.   I don't know what to think about what she wants.    She seems like she knows how I feel, and almost goads me into sayig something about it, but then she acts all innocent like it was nothing.      All the while misty assuring me that it's nothing and one moment telling wait it out, the next telling me, just ask her.    I'm downright nuts

      Ok, so that's not true, It's nearly noon and it's raining.   But, it feels bright and shiny.    Surely I'm just obsessed with this girl, and there's a million million things standing in the way.   But it's all different this time.    She notices me, she pays attention to me.    She likes me.     I know it now, I believe it now.      Last night she emailed me to tell me she wouldn't be online, we then exchanged like 6 short emails had our own chat through email without the need for MSN.    Brings back such memories I havn't done that in years.   Only ever been very special people I could do that with.      I want her, I will ask her out.   The questions are not certain yet, and not important, but I know now, it will happen.  She makes me want to change things about myself.   I'm wanting to see Harry Potter becuase she's a fan.  I think if she asked me I'd cut my hair.  I don't think I could give up my femininity completely, but, it's very possible I'd change some for her.   And I'm happy about that.     WOW....  I'm realizing how much sad music I listen too, and I'm not wanting to right now.   Hard to find something.  Hmmm, Noon, I should go find some breakfast. ;)

      Day one of 2 down.     Wandered to Stillwater, went all that way, for what?  Hairbands, that's it.  $1.97 elastic bands.     Killed time in hastings, flipped through Complete Divine.   Met up with Mikey, we talked then pretty much come home.     Misty wanted me to go out to Karaoke tonight.   I didn't tell her the real reason I didn't go is becuase I felt insulted by her telling me I shoudln't be singing Country and some offensive misogynistic Rap stuff would be better to sing.

      I got Andrea on my MSN now.       She at least seems interested in talking to me, I gave her the option of throwing the paper away.    On the other side of the coin, is Misty.   Poor girl, She seems to keep trying.   Don't know if that's the right answer, but since I know she can't give up, I guess it's her only choice.    Andrea seems to think it's worth fighting for an that Misty can pull it off.

      I don't really know what's going on in my life anymore.   I'm just adrift, and waiting.     Stalling till I can go to texas.    Shannon and I are going clothes shopping.    The expectation of that has become the sole of my existance now.

      And I even have pictures.   Misty helped me put on my makeup last night, It was so wonderful, I'll never be able to repay her.    I learned so much.   I really looked so much more feminine.   It was great, she even fixed my hair to make it more girly for a while and all.   It was just great.

      Thursday night I went to Karaoke, was kinda  a slow evening.    But wound up telling Alex about myself.    He already knew....    I'm not mad at her, little um uneasy though.      He seems ok, but I really wanna know that he's ok.     Not sure how to address it though.  French Manicured my nails, they look great.   hoping to keep them this way.  Took my brother to the mall yesterday, mainly just to go to Hot Topic to get goth makeup, only found black nail polish.   Prominade is a cool mall though.    Have to go there again.   Saw d20 Future in a shop. I so want that book.   Payday come faster...    I will HAVE to organize a game now.  Came close to telling my brother about me, especially when he was talking about buying a skirt for himself, it's a goth thing though, so it doesn't automatically mean he'd accept me in hip huggers and baby doll t ;)  We'll see what he says when i let him know i have mascara and eye liner....
