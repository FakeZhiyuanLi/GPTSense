       Ok I just finshed calling the company that dealt with the voice mail services.  Pretty reasonable rates.   29.95 a month...and a 49.95 activation fee.   Well i wish the activation fee was waived :(  But then you pay for the cost to the voice mail @ a resonable rate. And the turnaround is around 24-48hrs setup.

      Another fun hour here @ work. I decided to jot down whats on my mind. Let's see (scanning my brain)....Oh yes let's begin with what I've been working on. I have been working one of my websites ...its a site about golfing. I forgot that when you purchase a domain name you have to wait like almost 2 days before it goes live...so let me break this down for those who have no experience with purchasing domains...you start of by thinking of that name that you may want to use....find someone 2 host your site and once you have that its like a match making thing...you have to tell your domain (or name of your site) the directions to Miss WebHost's site...and once you do that they hook up....I would go further into that but i dont wanna bore you :) Anyway this golfing site was kickin my @ss....i stayed up late night night trying to set everything up and this morning I put in a couple of hours work just so I could set up a form on the site...AGGHHHHHHHH damn site....Ok I feel better...so in the long run I ended up forgeting the form...geez it was a  headache...maybe I'll pay someone to fix that for me :) ....Let's see what else...Earlier in my posts you may have heard me discuss my bowling book....well now im trying to craft up a salesletter so I can post it on the internet....In the past I never even made it this far. Bottom line is...im so tired of being broke man...i mean this living paycheck to paycheck sucks big tyme...so what im trying to do is recieve additional income on top of my current job...BUt hey I checke dmy mail yesterday and got a check from one of my business for $170....hey its not much but it's $170 I didnt have. Sorry got sidetracked...back to bowling..so I had to scan thru the book to get a full grasp of how im going to tackle the sales letter....Also I made a To-Do-List for tomorrow which includes...figuring out if im going to sell one of my business on ebay b/c I need some fast cash to try to see if I can pull something out my butt to save my car from saying "Nah Mah Nah Nah....Nah Nah Nah Nah...Hey Hey Hey...Good Bye" I have to send out some emails to "Like Someones checkin email on A Sunday" *lol* But it all depends on if im going to have enough energy to complete the task...12hrs takes alot out you....

      Well my weekedn was ok....besides the fact that I have to work today for 12 freakin hours......*sigh* Im goning to make it out the slump. I catch myself going to bed real late because I seem to search for answers that will get me out of the rat race. I also listen to training from various people that are successful with their business....oh by that way just incase i didnt mention it my goal is to work at home and make money 24/7 instead of the traditional way....u know the 9-to-5 maybe more depending on what the occupation may be. For me....I dont want to limit my income to what someone else states I should make. We thats all I have for now hope you guys enjoy your holiday just incase I dont do another post...  Happy Memorial Day....  I would be to happy while alot people have 3 and 4 day weekend...I will be working *lol* Have some Barbeque for me :)

Today I didnt really get a chance to work on my project...oh by the way my project is a book im writing :)...Just thought I would mention that.

      Sometimes I hate my job...i mean its cool sometimes but I believe its mostly the people @ anyones job. Like take today for example....here I am @ work minding my own business and I have well one of my "Higher Ups" walked into the space and said "Hey what are you doing" Im my mind im like....get out of here so what im checking my email during working hours.....grrr.....i was mad...I work 12hr days and they work less than 8 and he wants to ~H~A~T~E~ on me just because I wasnt working at that moment...so I had to hurry up and finish what I was doing. Anyways I had to make up an excuse to get away from my job "Oh...I be right back im gonna get something to eat" So thats why im writing this now. Ok....thats about it for now, back to the dungeon I go......  6 more hours to go....

I mean now its like I have nothing to lose I am at the bottom and theres no way to go but up.

I've been working on this project all day and I'm done with the hard part now all I have to do is go back and revise the content. Whew......feels  goods well thats all for now......

      This whole blogging thing is new to me....and I decided to give it a try to vent...or get whatevers on my mind onto virtual paper. I have no idea what I may or maynot write but it also shows the process that im charting to get from being broke to financially free.  Like the Navy says   "Let the journey begin"

      It's 1 day till payday. An my chargebacks are about 100 dollars....so that takes my pay down to around $890 or so...And alot of that is going to bills and food.  On a more positive note. I posted my ebay ads. I posted 8 different ads. So these are my begining test ads just to see if they will sell.   Im testing 3 day auctions and 5 day auctions....but I did mess up when I set up the auctions...instead of spreading out my auction to end at different times. I accidently put them all together to end at the same time....grrr...but hey its a step in the right direction to even post so that a plus....Ebay have some cool software uses called Turbo Lister...and in a nut shell its some Auction management software that will save you time instead of manually posting ads your self. So for 8 auctions my cost was like 15.20 thats not a bad price considering what you would have to pay for an classified auction in a local newspaper.  Anyways I know I always report alot of bad news in this blog, but thats whats going on in my life..you know. It will change in the future. The big ol' roller coaster.  Until next post.......

      Well this is payday week. And um...cable on the verge of being cut off. Let's see what else...oh yeah my phone in on a limited status...maybe if I call and beg for a courtesy extensionu ntil payday they will return my phone to full status, but I doubt it. Well on a more positive note...ive been cranking my ebay ads out. And I plan on a launch like either tomorrow ...F**k that I will list them tomorrow. What do I got to lose? Im already in debt...grrrr.................I'll rite more maybe tomorrow.

      Ladies and gentlemen the results are in...  I have not reached my goal of "no chargebacks"...so on that note I still wear the crown.  But, on another note I didnt get my tv or phone turned off so thats a plus....damn you know I hate piling bills and calls to my house unless its business or family, but when all you get are bill collectors...man that sh*t sucks.   On a more positive note...I got an email from a friend of mine was asking for some help to review some software...now this guy makes thousands online...and we all know networking is a good thing. Anyway...he asked if I could write a review for 10 different products he was going to offer his clients. Now some of you may think...oh you did that for free? Well im my opinion if I scratch his back he will scratch my back. See....he knows the formula for online success and me i want so very much to know the fomula...so it all works out. I will go to him whenever I need assitance....something I probally couldnt do if I didnt help him out :)   Plans for this week. Ebay..ebay...ebay. I got plans to run about maybe 10 different auctions. I just finshed my copy for my ads...and we'll see how they do. I'll keep you posted.

      Well It's a wrap...I know 4-sure that the chargebacks are coming...not like I wanted them to...but hell..I needed gas money.But the chargeback is the least of my concern right about now. The cable and phone being shut off....hopefully they will stay on until next week. I can hear the cable company calling now. Wait...maybe not b.c the phone might be off *Aggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh*

      The endofthe month is coming to a end....and so far so good with no charge backs (yippie), but you know I dont know if its going to last...just the other day I went into the under a hundred dollars category...better known as the "RED ZONE" And I spent like 80 dollars on food (hopfully)it will do me well into next week...so all I have left is enought money for gas until pay day next week. Will I survive the chargeback madness or will I continue to run my throne of "The Charge Back King" ....Stay turned for updates......

      I think im my last post i was talking about how I could win an "Most Chargeback" award...but so far this month I havenet had any....but we still have more time to go. Question is...will I tough it out and go without a chargeback or will I continue to lose 20 dollars for every chargeback...Time will tell. I'll keep you posted.

      Well i decided to come on back after...well i wouldnt say enjoying my off blog time (hey thats funny *Lol*) Man alot of s*@# has been going on you know....Like I think I should hold the record at my back from most charge backs in a month. I can see it now...like an Academy Awards show..."Our Most Chargeback winner is 1Brokeman......" You know this really ist funny...it rather sucks ass big time, but until im able to get more funds this is what I have to put up. But on a more positive note I had been having some money come out of my account for liek a year now and it will finally end at the end of this month. So next month I will "hopefully" have some extra money around to pay off some of these bills. I've been working on a way to make money with eBay...so I'll let you know how that goes. Well thats all for now.

Just me my fam'...the sun...the breeze...the sunset...the sand...the ocean...the feeling. Man it was great..all i needed was a chair ok i wouldnt mind a laptop so i could get my creative juices flowing in a relaxing atmosphere...Now thats living Hawaii...  Tomorrow I get my wisdom teeth pulled all 4..and maybe another 1. Sothat will be fun. Who knows i might gain wisdom from getting the wisdom teeth pulled *lol* we'll see...

      Im sitting here at work and I just had to look at the new Lexus convertables....hey I know its torture, but hey a man can dream ;)...N-e-way...I happened to listen to one of my mentors and how he thinks....he said to be succesfull we should chose your lifestyle 1st then build your business around your lifestyle. Many times we build our business and our life our jobs or business. So I decided to come up with how I want to live my lifestyle....so after some thinking here is what i came up with.  1Brokeman's Lifestyle  1. I want to go to work whenever I feel like it. 2. I dont want to commute long hrs to work. 3. I never ever....ever want to have to worry about money anymore. (FINANCIALLY FREE) 4. I want to work from home 5. I want to be able to travel whenever I feel 6. I want to speak to customers if i feel like it.  More to come.....

I mean its cool to some people but unless I'm making money...I reall could care less. Another thought...im 25 yrs old and yet I still clean floors like im a 18 yr old. Bullshit *Aghhhh Im mad * How can I be tasked to do such a job...Fuck this shit man...and excuse my French...I gotta get out of this mess. I gotta be financially free...im so mad...I'll write more later.
