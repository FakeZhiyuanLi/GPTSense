      BEIJING (Reuters) - The Olympic flame has started a warm-up lap around Beijing as the host of the 2008 Games becomes the fifth city on a six-week relay back to Athens for this year's Olympiad.  China's best-known Olympian, NBA all-star Yao Ming, is due to trot the final leg of a 55-km (34-mile) course from Tiananmen Square to the Summer Palace.  He will be the last of 148 athletes to bear the fabled torch for the first time in China, including Olympic table tennis champion Deng Yaping and gymnast Sang Lan, the national pommel horse champion paralysed at a 1998 meet in the United States, Xinhua news agency said.  The torch, which arrived on Tuesday aboard a Greek chartered jumbo jet called Zeus, began its journey in Tiananmen Square and will zigzag past construction zones of Games venues and other projects under way for 2008.  The flame, lit from the sun's rays in Olympia on March 25, will travel to 33 cities in 34 days and for the first time reach all five continents represented by the Olympic rings.  The flame will return to Greece on July 9 for a final homecoming tour before entering the Olympic stadium to light the cauldron on August 13.  copyright to reuters.co.uk  Any comments apprciated.

      SHANGHAI, China - One baby died and 20 were hospitalized with severe malnutrition in eastern China after drinking low-quality milk powder, a state newspaper said Wednesday, two months after a nationwide crackdown on fake infant formula.  The infants in Suqian, a city northwest of Shanghai, suffered from swelling and anemia, both symptoms of severe malnutrition, the Legal Daily newspaper said.  Two twins were so swollen that their eyes were sunken and doctors were unable to draw blood from their limbs, said the newspaper, published by China's Justice Ministry. It said two infants still were being treated and 18 have been released.  The cases in Suqian, in Jiangsu province, follow a crackdown ordered by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao after at least a dozen infants died from malnutrition blamed on counterfeit formula in Fuyang, a city in neighboring Anhui province.  On Wednesday in Fuyang, Mayor Liu Qingqiang was reprimanded by the ruling Communist Party for failing to supervise food safety, while Vice Mayor Ma Mingyue was asked to resign, state media reported.  Other local leaders were also disciplined by the party, including the head of the health bureau and the head of industry and commerce, the Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television reported.  In the continuing crackdown, authorities have banned 55 brands of cheap milk powder after they were found to contain only tiny fractions of the required amounts of protein and other nutrients.  Inspectors in Suqian found two brands on sale that contained as little as 1.5 percent nutrients, Legal Daily said. The national standard is 12 percent to 20 percent.  Investigators say the inferior milk powder is mostly starch, flour and sugar.  The powders' containers listed fake addresses and phone numbers for manufacturers, the newspaper said. It said authorities were trying to trace them through shops that sold the products.  The victims of low-quality foods and medicine sold in China are often the country's poorest people. Many parents of malnourished children were too poor to take them to hospitals. They died and were buried at home.  Two officials have been arrested for covering up the malnutrition death of a baby girl in Anhui. At least 229 infants there suffered from malnutrition after drinking low-quality formula.

      Well, last Thursday I went to Longleat Safari Park. It is a great place, lovely gardens, great animals, but there's one let-down. The let-down is all around the park, whether its to do with the grass, or the tennis courts, For example, almost everywhere in longleat there are signs displaying " don't walk on Grass" and on the tennis courts there was a sign reading "Do not play Tennis". Okay, I understand why they would not like you to walk on grass, but what did we walk on before the invention of concrete and tar mac? Grass was made to walk on, it was gods intention. Also, what is the point of having a tennis court if there is no tennis to be played on it?. If you go to a place like that then you expect to have fun, and you do, but worrying about " Am I allowed to go down there?" or " Am I allowed to do this?". What are your opinions on 'signs' like this? As always, all opinions appreciated.  p.s Apologies on the fact that this is nothing to do with China :-)

      I was just watching this thing ov TV, on CCTV 9 International ( a chinese t.v station in english ) and it was all about a flood that happened in the late 90's, 1998 i believe was the year it happened. The Xiliao River overflowed it's banks in northen China, Inner Mongolia. hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes and there was wide devastation throughout China, yet we only came to know about this recently. Why would China keep it a secret for so long? What do you think? All comments appreciated.
