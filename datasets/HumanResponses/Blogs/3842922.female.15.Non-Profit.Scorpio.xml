      Phew, bloody conked. Went shoe shopping with Hyon Xhi today. I’m on some kind of shopping high. Anyway, the guys thought I dressed like a  slut  today. Sheesh. It was just a t-shirt, skirt and sneakers. Like wtf? Anyway, doesn’t matter. We created a word today.  Ah Hoe . And it’s used to describe people like me. Haha. Anyway, had loads of fun shopping today. We went to like,  two  shopping malls just to find that sacred pair of bloody  HUSH PUPPIES . I was thinking about like, Adidas or something along that line, but hell,  HUSH PUPPIES . Sheesh, unbelievable. Anyway, it was on sale. So it came to about, RM140. I paid half, naturally. Hahah! Kudos to Hyon Xhi, he finally owns a pair of  passable  and  lookable  shoes.  We did loads of shit at Starbucks. We attempted to  con  them.   Steps to rip Starbucks off:   1)	Ask for a cup of hot water 2)	Add chocolate powder from the sugar and milk bar. 3)	Add milk 4)	VOILA, your cup of hot chocolate. FREE.  Check out  urlLink Hyon Xhi's  site for the video.  Hah, anyway, I’ll just let the pictures speak for themselves.  Breakfast for the guys at Starbucks. Soo Guan checking out an orgasmic coffee mug.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      urlLink    Breakfast at Tiffany's. Yea, right. Haha, tapau McDonalds and went for coffee in Starbucks.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    HAH, the FREE hot chocolate&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Hyon Xhi the cheapskate savouring his FREE hot chocolate&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    A note we kindly left for the barristas telling them how they ripped us off. And thanking them for not shooing us away as we were fooling around and snapping pictures.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The first shop we visited. Adidas. But they only sell gHey shoes there. Too bad for Hyon Xhi, thank God I got to save like, 80 bucks.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Second shop we visited. Royal Sporting House. No more pictures of signboards after this. We were at Timberland when some bloody bitch told me that I wasn't allowed to take pictures without their permission. Hello, it's like, FREE advertisement. What's wrong with the world? Hell hath seen no fury like a woman scorned. DO NOT BUY TIMBERLAND. TIMBERLAND IS SATANIC. YOU'LL DIE WEARING TIMBERLAND.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    After many more visits to other shoe shops, we decided to take a detour and visit the Reject Shop to see Hyon Xhi's John Langford briefs! HAHAHA! Saw that? Ultimate coolness.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    At the second shopping mall, finally got his pair of shoes in Hush Puppies of all bloody places. Anyway, it was a mutual agreement. Very good buy. Although it was one size smaller than Hyon Xhi's shoe size coz they did not have a bigger one. Like hell, Malaysians wear a size 10 max? Wtf? Anyway, look at him. So adorable! HAHAH!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    YES, AT LAST!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Look at that sacred pair of shoes. We spent so many bloody hours looking for an above average pair of shoes. Sheesh&nbsp; urlLink     Well, that pretty much sums up our shopping trip. Well, I’ll post up my slutty outfit picture (or so the guys claim) and you be the judge. I honestly thought there was nothing wrong with it. I’ll have to wait for Hyon Xhi to send me the picture from his pc. Oh yes, I got my navel screw already. YAY! AND YES, Hyon Xhi looked presentable today, without his Ronald McDonald shoes.  Hopefully tonight’s plans aren’t cancelled.  Edgar’s such a pain in the arse . Bloody ruining my weekend. Sheesh. Signing off now, getting a shower. Oh yes, thank you  urlLink Chee Liang , Soo Guan and  urlLink Hyon Xhi  for an Ah Hoe day.

      Phew, just finished watching Legally Blonde on TV. Shit, that must be like, one of the best movies ever (fine, sue me for bad taste). Anyway, hah, going shoe shopping with Hyon Xhi, Soo Guan, and Chee Liang. Bloody conmen trying to rip me off. Sheesh. What happened to chivalry and gallantry? Down the bloody drain, I'm sure. Anyway, yes, going to go get cash from daddy and get dressed. I'm bringing my digicam along, so peeps, enjoy the article later on today, yes? I'm sure I'll have a ball.

      Okay,  beauty and grooming day . One of my favourite days. Today, we’ll do online shopping for a pretty gHey friend of mine, TAN HYON XHI! He has sucky, sucky shoes and a suckier sense of fashion. No wait, make that ZERO sense of fashion. Anyway, my goal today is to change Hyon Xhi’s dress sense from Mamat-ish to a bad boy look. One that exudes charm and danger. Women totally dig bad boys. Anyway, I’ve tried not to totally alter his whole T-shirt and shorts look thus the change is slightly more subtle yet I’m sure, effective.  Our subject:   urlLink    HAHAHAH! Look at that vaginal face&nbsp; urlLink     What he was wearing to make me go  hysterical  and want to choke on 6 foot long cactuses:   urlLink    THIS&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    and THIS&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    AND GOD FORBID, THIS! Anyway, I couldn't get the exact shoe, but it looks alike.&nbsp; urlLink         Outfit 1:    urlLink    Armani T-shirt. With the hoe there. Very sexy with jeans.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Polo Jeans Co. Spells sexy. This goes really well with the orange shirt up there.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    THERE! Ultimate sexiness! Wear this on top of the orange shirt. Btw, this is Armani as well.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Adidas Originals Mundial Goal. Whoa, orgasmic&nbsp; urlLink         Outfit 2:    Ralph Lauren Polo tee. Black is sexy&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     urlLink    Polo Jeans Co. Goes well with the black polo tee.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Armani. Goes bloody well with the black polo tee.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Cole Haan G-series. ORGASMIC.&nbsp; urlLink         Outfit 3:   Simple AX tee&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     urlLink    Armani shorts. Very casual and laidback&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Puma Sneakers! WHOA&nbsp; urlLink           Bits and pieces for Hyon Xhi..     Shoes:    urlLink    Cole Haan G-series in black&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Adidas Superstar II&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Adidas Originals Forum Canvas&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Adidas Originals Montreal&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Adidas flip flops&nbsp; urlLink      Shirts and T-shirts:    urlLink    Horoscope tees by Paul Smith. This is the Gemini one. They have all 12. I thought this was really cool!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    This looks cool with the Adidas Montreal &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Armani plaid shirt&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Armani mix texture shirt&nbsp; urlLink      Shorts:    urlLink    Ralph Lauren shorts. Very familiar. OOH YES, Edgar has something like this in navy, or green. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    FCUK shorts. Nice.&nbsp; urlLink        Finally, I’m done. Absolutely going conks. So bloody tiring and  not to mention boring. Sheesh. Anyway, I chose Armani Xchange and mostly Ralph Lauren because they suit Hyon Xhi best. I mean, hello, you can’t picture Hyon Xhi in D&Gs can you? Not cool enough for D&Gs. Anyway, haha, he still has that  Mamat  look. :P   For the fashion illiterates, Cole Haan’s G-series incorporates the Nike Air technology. They’re selling it here in Malaysia in 1 Utama and KLCC in Shuz Sports. Average price is about RM700 ++.  You know what? After applying HALF of my skills, I think Hyon Xhi can’t be made into  looking good . I just can’t figure out what looks good on him. Tell you what Hyon Xhi darling, we go  shopping  tomorrow if you like. Gotta jet, I have Add Math tuition in like, 40 minutes.  On a totally different scale,   urlLink    I HAD TO POST THIS! AHAHAHAHAHAH! OMFG! How GHEY can you get?&nbsp; urlLink     CHEERS peeps. Have a nice day. 

      Had a bad day. Again. I honestly think I was Queen of the Entire Universe in my past life who assrapes ugly men with 6 foot long cactuses and humps cute guys. Talk about bad karma. Sheesh..  1. Slept at 2.30am after  chocolate pudding  2. Half awake at 6.50am  3. Stumbled out of bed  4. Got under the shower and woke up for real 5. Got dressed, wait for car, go school 6. Went to school. Someone was a bitch as usual. GOD I HATE HER! 7. Had assembly. Laughed at Andrew coz he came late, and laughed at Hyon Xhi coz he tried to flirt with a prefect. Got pissed with some stupid stuck up prefect who's still on probation. Thank God *muah muah* that she has HORRIBLE hair. All's fair after all. 8. Got to class. Rushed to finish up my Biology PEKA. Hello?! Can't anyone skip school for 2 days in peace? It happens every bloody time. Whenever I miss school, I come back to some shitload of work given by bounteous teachers.  9. Got bloody mad at the stupid bitch, Azlinda, the Maths teacher. I'm sure she hates me coz I cheated at an exam she was invigilating.  10. Got really pissed AGAIN at some PEOPLE in class who had to SCREAM " CIKGU, PONTENG!" which in English means, "TEACHER, SOMEONE'S PLAYING HOOKIE FROM YOUR CLASS". Excuse me, school WAS supposed to be over, and I needn't sit down for an extra 25 minutes listening to her talk about some stupid King. And I had to miss my bloody tuition coz I got home late. ARGH. 11. Hadn't had the mood to do anything the whole day. Sat around moping. 12. ADD MATHS. Shucks. Did a shitload of add maths just now.    urlLink    look at that shitload of add maths.&nbsp; urlLink      OH YES! I did talk to Mr. Spendar today. Felt euphoric for like, a couple of minutes. Then it wore off, and we didn't talk the whole night although he was online. As i said, I think he's ignoring me. Sheesh.  HAHAH! Did the most innovative thing yesterday! I lost the screw of my navel barbell, AGAIN. This time, I replaced it with DENTAL WAX! HAHAH! It's VERY mouldable, so I just rolled it up into a ball and stuck it at the sharp end of my barbell. Btw, the dental wax is to patch up the brackets of your braces to prevent if from cutting the gums.   NAH, A PIECE OF DENTAL WAX FOR YOU. Shit, I can't believe it's still on my navel barbell! HAHA! Haven't had the time to go buy yet.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Anyway,  THERE HYON XHI , I'm not ripping you off. Life and philosophy. MY LIFE AND MY PHILOSOPHY.  I'm surrounded by bloody 2 faced bitches. They like rubbing salt onto the wound. My "friends" know I'm like, depressed, lonely and obsessed. Yet the particular bitch flashes her OH-MY-BOYFRIEND-GOT-ME-THIS ring and made deafening squeals the whole day through like he asked her to marry him and have great sex everyday.   GIRLS ARE EVIL. EEEEE-VEEEEEEEL bitches I tell you. Sheesh. Argh! Such a bloody  CONSTIPATED  bitch! YEA! That was the word I was looking for.   *Imitates that stupid bitchy whiny voice*  "So and so got me this" "So and so got me this as well" "Daddy got me this"  "YES DADDY, YESSSS! FASTER, DADDY, FASTER...OOOOH DADDY, HARDER! HARDER, DADDY! YESSS, AAAH, UHHMM, I'M CUMMING DADDY....SCREECHES TO THE POINT OF CRACKING GLASSES" (hah, yea right, I wish)  "I think I'm a fat bitch, O Edna the great one, do you think I'm a constipated bitch?"  ANYWAY, I'm happy to know that at least I own more brains than her. At least I can do INTEGRATION without any problems. HAH! If that bitch ever comes across an INTEGRATION question, she'll be sitting down scratching her hairy cunt for hours. Man that just makes me happy. She cannot burst my bubble. Anyways, my ego is inflatable. I have enough self confidence left to stuff many more arses. To hell with constipated bitches.  I'm feeling much better after a session of hardcore bitching. HAH! nitey peeps.  p/s: There Hyon Xhi, I posted up an article on LIFE AND PHILOSOPHY. Moral of the story: GIRLS ARE EEEE-VIIIL, especially  big fat constipated bitches  like THAT.

      Nah, no theme article today. No time to even update properly. Waited online for Mr. Spendar but he ain't here yet. Need to study. Haha! I'll post some stuff up later when I have the time. Anyway, had a crap day. Totally. Feel like bitching. Will do it soon. VERY soon. I can't contain myself for very long. Anyway, screw you Hyon Xhi, you made me skip tuition. I got home so bloody late that I couldn't make it for tuition. Sheesh.

      NO NO NO..I really am. You must be thinking "How does a perverse bitch get depressed?" Lemme give you a couple of reasons why I'm depressed.  1) I think Mr. Spendar doesn't like me. Or he's ignoring it. 2) SPM is in like, 118 days 3) I was the navigator to Shah Alam for dessert. Turned one turning too early. So ended up in PKNS building and had to retrace back to Federal Highway. Sheesh. Called mom. Got screwed from her, edgar, drew, and definitely loads more. HAaha, anyway, Choc pudding lifted my spirits up. We had it in Little Italian Kitchen. It's like, beside Concorde Hotel. Will do a write up about it one day. 4) I'm stoned, yet can't sleep. Coz Mr. Spendar doesn't like me, or so I think. 5) I think Mr. Spendar doesn't like me. Or he's ignoring it.  HAH! I'm lame and pathetic now. I'm at like, the lowest point of my teenage life. ARGH. I need to see people suffer. ARGHh! Yea yea, I'm a sadist. So what? FUCK YOU.

      Had a horrible day; so far.   1. Woke up at 6.50am 2. Decided not to go to school 3. Back to sleep 4. Woke up again for good at about, 9.30am 5. Did some chatting online with a horrible 2 faced bitch and other people 6. Went brush teeth 7. Shower 8. Solitary sex plus great orgasm 9. Breakfast 10. Did Sunitha's physics work 11. Look for material for Friday's article 12. Do more physics 13. Taking a break now and decide to post up something (novelty hasn't worn off yet)  Oh yes, when I feel generous enough, I'm gonna teach you girls how to achieve the greatest, most explosive orgasm in your life. I finally got the arcanum that many can only dream of. And it's all thanks to my imagination and *ahem* skills.  Looking forward to something in the evening and getting the digicam back tmr. Dad took it to UK i think. MY STOMACH'S GROWLING. I haven't had anything to eat since breakfast. Sheesh, there's nothing to eat here, and both my drivers are in coll(Harvin and Edgar) :( What a conundrum. Anyway, I need to drag myself back to the stupid physics work. OVERLOAD..

      Well, I did promise you that Wednesday’s theme is  SEX EDUCATION  didn’t I?  Anyway, before we go into the more complicating matters of sex education, here’s something that we never get to learn in school. A step-by-step guide to having sex. No really, I mean, how can you learn if you do not have visual images to help you, right? GUYS, listen up! I may feel generous enough to pass on a few tips on what women want.  WARNING: This article may cause either a severe boner or just a horribly disgusted reader who thinks I’m incredibly slutty and therefore curse me to a lifetime of bad sex. I sincerely hope it’s the former.   1) Well, obviously, you start of getting hot and heavy. Wherever you please. Sadly, I’m way behind my studies, so this is like the closest I can find to getting hot and heavy. HAHA! I beg your pardon eh peeps?    urlLink    getting all hot and heavy (sorry bout the lack of originality, ahha)  2) After that, we graduate to urh, the part where  WOMEN  gets pleased.  BOYS, pay attention.  This is what women want. To be satiated until satisfied. Let them have their pleasure before you take yours, you bloody selfish, teenie weenie bastard. I’ve over-spilled. From now on, let your imagination and skills take place.   urlLink    the pose is a lil exotic. HAH! nevertheless, the girl looks like she's having a ball. lookie! he's eating her good.&nbsp; urlLink      3) Now, if the guy gets lucky, he might get blowed.    urlLink    sorry about the horribly contrasting pictures. The first hoe was a blonde. sheesh!&nbsp; urlLink     4) Lastly, the reward. A fucking orgasmic session. You insert your dick into her welcoming channel. Okay? Or do you need a  dummy’s guide to fucking  handbook? Sheesh. I’m already spoon-feeding you the art of making love, you fucktard.    urlLink    lookie!&nbsp; urlLink     There you go. I’ve given you the VERY basic acts of love-making. I haven't the time to elaborate and find more pics. Besides, it's human nature, I can't teach you everything. The rest is up to your skills, imagination, creativity and abilities; not to mention your erh, instrument. :P   CHEERS!  p/s: Okay, I thought this article was a lil over-porned.  Hah! Anyway, I’m sure nuns worldwide such as a certain Ms. Kat are insulted over the  amateur  female exploitation. Hello, we’re doing this for the sake of EDUCATION. So yes, I’ve tried to make it a tad pleasant to the retinas. I believe I hadn't done a very good job but hell, this is all the time I can spare.

      Heyya Mr. Jap Act,  1. Thanks for sabotaging my site  2. Thanks for unscrewing up my site  3. Screw you.  Oh yes, hah, I'll think about the quarter. HAHA! call me what you want. You fap (fucking+jap=fap) act.  Yes yes, I owe you your bloody half a shoe. Sheesh. RIP OFF.  You have horrible taste in shoes. You need ME to help eradicate your horrible fashion sense. I'LL be your Saviour and Salvation. I'll help you get the chicks with beautiful suede shoes. NOT RONALD MCDONALD ONES. So I'm doing you a favour by paying half for your future beautiful pair of shoes. I didn't even get Joyce a b'day present. And she's been nicer to me. Sheesh, I'm feeling remorse now. I can't believe I got conned into offering to buy the FAP act half a pair of shoes. :P   Oh yes, to whom it may concern, from now on, my current obsession (guy) will be known as Mr.Spendar. The Spendar just came out of nowhere. Anyway, it sounds cool.   Will log off now, OBVIOUSLY Mr. Spendar isn't coming online. I waited the whole fucking night for him. Sheesh. :P

I have great taste in shoes. So fuck off mate! Wooohoo!  Oh fuck? Guess what? She's taking her offer back? Only half a shoe and no lunch? Wtf man? WTF? Come on Xin Yi. WE HAD A DEAL MAN? Italian! Dutch? Screw you.  Don't push the threshold of your bitch-ness. You're already there. Hah.  Okay. Since you insist on being CHEAP. Fine. I forgive you. So there. Oh wait.

      Phew, my first effort at blogging. Back to what blogging is about, sheesh. Had a fuspid (fucking+stupid=fuspid) day. Argh!!!! I started of my morning like every other morning.   1. Maid wakes me up from an orgasmic dream at about, 6.45am 2. Yell at the maid. 3. Sleep for like 2.14 minutes  3. Wake up again, this time by alarm clock 4. Smash the alarm clock 5. Wake up for good 6. Blast the stereo 7. Brush my teeth 8. Shower 9. Get dressed for school 10. Wait for the car   BUT, it was a shittier day today compared to MOST days because I somehow lost the cover of my navel barbell. Like WTF?! I cannot survive without the stopper because the barbell might slip off and the piercing might close up. So naturally, I called my brother to drop by Bukit Raja after coll.   Conversation between Edgar and Edna  Edna : Where the fuck are you?  Edgar : Coll, why? Edna : I need a fucking favour.  Edgar : What? Edna : I need you to drop by Bukit Raja to get me a cover for my barbell.  Edgar : WTF is a barbell?  Edna : The thingy used to pierce my navel you ignorant m'fucker.   Edgar : I cannot larh, I have to fetch my friend home and he needs to be home early. Edna : KANINA! FUCKING DROP BY FOR LIKE 5 MINUTES LARH! CANNOT ARH? !#%#*^*&!   Edgar : Ahh okay, where is it? Edna: *gives description* (feels a flicker of hope). Fuck you larh asshole. BYE.   25 minutes later... (car pulls up in front of the house) (bubbly Edna rushes to the fucking door)  Edna : Where's my stud?  Edgar : Oh shit I forgot  Edna : KAN NIN LAU BU! FUCK YOU LARH ASSHOLE! FUCK YOU! YOU FUCKING MORON! KAN NI NA!      Anyway, school was okay today. Had some stupid "prize-giving" thingy for softball but didn't have enough time. Assembly time was extended. Thank God I get to miss like a period of fucking Maths. I hate that constipated bitch who reeks of cheap Petaling Street perfume.   Rushed to finish my Physics PEKA (naturally copied from Hyon Xhi-the jap act). Hahah! Had the weirdest History teacher today. She's a replacement teacher who replaced (duh) my previous History teacher who's in child labour .Anyway, she's a fucking timid teacher. The first thing she did when she came into class was,        "Nama saya......" (My name is...)         ( Scrambles to the board to write " ZARINA BT. MUDA" )  And when she's happy with the font and size, she stands in front at stares at us. And there goes the period. Ms. Farina (fucking+zarina=farina). But she's cute. That chubby lil girl look.  OhhhhhH! I'M HAVING AN ORGASM! Mrs. Sundari, my EST teacher wore ORGASMIC shoes today! Sheesh, I'm sure she's the only teacher in school who would appreciate Sergio Rossis. Man, I love her taste in shoes.   And somehow, Chee Liang managed to piss AND hurt me royally when I told him about my crush. He said something like, fugly and bitch makes a great couple. Sheesh. Anyway, ahha, ignored them all the way home. Sorry guys. haha.   And i missed my car. FUCKING PEOPLE. TAN MUN FAI, TAN BOON TAT AND GOD KNOWS WHO. Like, they knew I would be out in time to catch the car yet they did not bother waiting for me. And you're blaming me for being cynical? HELLO?! I can't help it with people like these.  Okay, now i have Sunitha to catch or else she'll assrape me with her Chemistry books. Shucks, how do I get away unscathed and un-yawned from an hour and a half of Chemistry tuition?

          HAHAHAH! As you can guess by the title, I had a pretty fun day.        &nbsp;   1   ) Woke up at 11am, yell at Jason.        &nbsp;   2) Went back to sleep.       &nbsp;   3) Woke up for good at 12.26pm coz Michelle called and said that she's 7.46 minutes from my house. Which gives me NOT enough time to take a shower, wash my hair, get dressed and make up-fy myself.       &nbsp;   4) Picked me up at 12.59pm and went to Ikano Power Centre with Lawrence, Nick, Edgar and Mich.       &nbsp;   5) Met Wendy, Wai Hong, Neng, Mi and family at Fasta Pasta where we had lunch. (sorry peeps, digicam's still in Argentina.)       &nbsp;   6) Had a bloody good laugh the whole day. Made fun of Lawrence's gay sense of fashion.       &nbsp;   7) Hanged out. Went back at about, 5pm       &nbsp;   8) Got home at about 6pm, showered and got dressed and makeup-ed.       &nbsp;   9) Went for some relative's birthday dinner. Lemme try explaining it to you. He's my grandmother's mother's brother's son. HAHAH! So he's my grandmother's cousin. Think about it yes? Haahah! I love puzzles like this. So we're very distantly related, I mean, my generation. He's my granduncle, yes?       &nbsp;   10) My eardrums threatened to rupture half an hour in at the dinner.       &nbsp;   11) Bloody old, DRUNK men were attempting to sing karaoke. OH MY FUCKING GOD! Had a perfectly asswipe time listening to them sing. And they were singing songs that came from the Stone Age. I had absolutely no fucking idea what them tone-deaf drunkards were singing. Had an absolute ball! We (the cousins), swayed and bobbed our head to the music. We gave the loudest claps, we hooted. HAHAH! We wanted to be kind, you see. In the end, everybody couldn't take it anymore, they decided to shut down the karaoke system and decided to play Vengaboys instead. Shit, you can't even consider them techno.&nbsp; Oh my fucking eardrums.        &nbsp;   12) So yes, now I'm considering whether to go out for a drink with Har.        &nbsp;    Anyway peeps, will blog tomorrow yes?        Cheers, have a nice day!

      Yay! My favourite day,    BEAUTY AND GROOMING DAY   ! Okay, I decide to do something different today.    Hair care   . Yep, for guys and girls yes? For the past year, I’ve been sticking religiously to this. My TIGI haircare range ( I mean, besides shampoos that I just can not resist buying, like, Schwarzkopf).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyway, they sell this at most Shins boutiques. As far as I know, there's 2 Shins in Klang. One in Bukit Raja and another at either Tesco or Giant.  &nbsp;  Price range goes from RM30++ to RM100++ (Okay, some may be pretty expensive) though the shampoo and conditioners are cheap.  &nbsp;  Check out TIGI products&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink    here    .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Cheers peeps. Have a nice day.  &nbsp;  p/s: I promise, I'll post up the 2 articles I owe you guys soon.   pp/s: Erh, people. There's something wrong with the pics. I can't post it up. So just go check out the link. If you need help on products, mail me or send me a comment and I'll tell you which one works best yes?

       Hey darling readers. Decided to do something     sensitive     for the life and philosophy's article. Well, after going through some "turbulence" these past few days ( hey, I'm not being dramatic..yea, right.ahah!), I realised something. That there is erh, a rainbow after the storm..or something along that lines. HAHA! Correct me if I'm wrong.     &nbsp;  My darling friends made me very happy the past couple of days.    &nbsp;    1) Melissa P. Louis      &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Thanks for following me up to Shah Alam and get bloody drenched in the bloody rain.&nbsp;Haha!We had to sit on newspapers in the bloody cab.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Thanks for lending me a shoulder to cry on (and erh, not to mention, wipe off some "hingus")    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Thanks for caring even though you're going through your own rough patch.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *muackz*, thanks Mel.    &nbsp;    2) Harvinder Singh Dhaliwal      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Thanks for entertaining me and all the mamak and beer nights.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Thanks for the bloody consultation in my house the other day. And yes, pass me the cheque. I promise I won't give you a blank one.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Thanks for suffering through mamak just now with my mom and bro after pool. Haha! you too    Satish   .    &nbsp;    3) Prakash Jayakumar      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Thanks for picking up the phone at erh, 2 something in the morning followed by another 5.21am call and listen to me cry and rant.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Yes, anyway, I' m sorry if I missed any one out. You just know who you are. As I was saying, there's always a rainbow after the storm (just bloody correct me).     &nbsp;  After suffering from serious depression, melancholia and    tear-jerking-itis    (there's such a condition, check it up, stupid), I'm glad to say I'm finally okay (drumroll.....drama queen in the making).&nbsp; And yay! I'll be back to blogging. Full time!    &nbsp;  Although I had to endure sleepless nights (explains why I haven't been going to school), hours of endless crying and most definitely, more hours of studying to get thoughts out of my mind, I thought it was worth it. Harvin told me that I was taking my friends for granted.&nbsp;Shit, how bloody true. I've been pretty ungrateful, taking people for granted. I've always assumed friends would be there. But hey hey, I learnt my lesson the hard way. I haven't had the guts to call up friends in the middle of the night coz I felt embarassed that I took them for granted.    &nbsp;  In the end, there was no one else to cry to but guess who, EDGAR, the fucktard. I swear, he looked like he wanted to kill himself there and then. Anyway, I' m glad that my friends haven't given up on me.&nbsp; I swear, my arrogance will kill me one day.    &nbsp;  But besides having friends, faith and trust in myself got me through. I'm sure I was feeling suicidal but seriously, I talked to myself (no, i'm not retarded) and convinced myself that I have more to live for. Hey I know this is weird, me being deep and sensitive and all but I'm honest.     &nbsp;  Anyway, my point is, if ever you feel that life isn't going anywhere for you, trust me, everything'll be alright. It takes time and patience. But if you got dumped,&nbsp;had bad sex&nbsp;and you can't find your favourite comfort chocolate all in 24 hours, go hang yourself. You'll never survive. Did I mention? Snickers, loads of it, got me through.     &nbsp;  Okay peeps. Enough. Even my arse is pooping tears. Over touchy for me. How embarassing.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

         Whoa people, orgasmic :   &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink      &nbsp;    Well, decided to do a piece on time pieces for my   Beauty and Grooming Day  .        &nbsp;    1) The Piaget Upstream Chronograph for Men. I love this. So bloody sexy seeing a guy wearing this.        &nbsp;    2) Hermes Belt Lady for Ladies (duh). This is such a great piece. You can wear this with anything. It's casual yet elegant at the same time. Just absolutely classy.        &nbsp;    3) Cartier Panthere All Steel for Men and Women. This is HAWT. I mean, it's&nbsp; a staple timepiece. Anyone worth their salt will know what a classic this is. First runner up to a Rolex. Honestly, this should be the first watch you people buy with your first hard earned salary.        &nbsp;    4) Gucci 1900 Series for Women. Honestly, I'm not really into the Gucci-watch thingy. But&nbsp;I thought this is nice. I mean, it's feminine and elegant. Looks great with a white lycra t-shirt, faded jeans and Sergio Rossi heels. Doesn't it? haha!        &nbsp;    5) Hugo Boss Vanquisher Chronograph for Men. You have to admit it. Chronos are sexy. And this IS sexy, in a rugged way. Bad boy watch.        &nbsp;    6) Chopard Ice Cube for Ladies. I honestly think this is a very good buy. It's professional, casual and elegant. And a lil masculine. Just bloody hot.        &nbsp;    7) Ebel Classic Wave Chronograph for Men and Women. It lives up to its name. A classic. I remember this watch very clearly coz it's my Mom's favourite time piece. Though hers is the gold and silver one. But it looks really good on Mom. Haha!        &nbsp;    8) Tag Heuer 2000 Exclusive Automatic for Men. Though I totally hate Tags, I thought this looks pretty good. Don't you think? I mean, it's a lil chunky, but ruggedly macho. HAHA! Like, what the fuck?        &nbsp;    Anyway, if you noticed, I chose mostly&nbsp;square-faced timepieces. An obsession for now. Well, I did not include the Rolex coz honestly, there's nothing interesting about it. Wanted to get some Baume and Merciers but lazy to look for more. And no Swatches this time, though I'm a big fan.        &nbsp;    Check    urlLink   this      out for quick reference.

        Well, I ran out of ideas for today's article. So I'll just give you an insight of a legend's life, my life. Heh!       &nbsp;   I was born a beautiful, healthy baby on the 17th of November 1988 to a pilot father and a housemaker mother. Naturally, they love me. I was pampered, well fed and watered. Unfortunately, nothing is perfect. I was "blessed" with an elder brother. Or should we say, he was blessed with a beautiful sister. Haha! So yea. Then it began, a threshold of greatness and wonder, on that magical day, 17th November 1988. I could have sworn, the thunders boomed and heavens rained.       &nbsp;   Grew up to be a spoiled brat. Daddy spoiled me. Mom didn't though. She was evil then.&nbsp;I was forced to endure hours of torture during meal times. I hated eating when I was young. Prolly just her food. And although I was a bright child (ahem, naturally), I was forced to do shitload of Math and read Peter and fucking Jane books when I was in kindie. Daddy wasn't around to stop the canes from coming coz he has to work. Anyway, life was still great.       &nbsp;   Erh, grandpa passed away when I was 6 and in Primary One. It was really sad as we (all the cousins) were really close to him. I still miss him. Anyway, so yea. A year or so later, my parents separated. Mom accused Dad of infidelity, Dad accused Mom of infidelity, ladidadida. A whole load of bullshit. As usual, the poor kids has to endure their parents' mindless arguments and we were asked that ineluctable question, " Who do you want to stay with? Mommy or Daddy?" Bloody hell. Give me a break. I was a bloody 7 year old (a beautiful one, that is). Anyway, it is said and done. We followed Daddy. Mom stays nearby though. She's now a very succesful woman and I'm proud of her. I mean, she left house with no working experience and no money. Looking back, it was a tough struggle for her.        &nbsp;   Life was well, passed my PTS (an examination) and managed to skip a grade and do the express class. Did well for my UPSR (another examination). And ta-da. In secondary school before I knew it. Had to go for surgery to cure my heart condition (nothing serious) in Sec. One. Then it began. The rebellion. Hahah! I was bloody rebellious. You name it, smoking, drinking, playing hookie. Phone bills went up. Shopping bills went sky high. Dad went berserk. Then Mom.&nbsp; My parents are crazy. Anyway, so yes.        &nbsp;   I've been to many places, seen many things (it helps to be a pilot's daughter, first class anywhere, everywhere). But the most memorable holiday was to America in December 2002 with Mom and Edgar. Had an absolute ball. Celebrated Christmas with relatives there. Dad was super nice before we left. He gave me cash to go shopping. A lil surprising considering the fact that my&nbsp;Dad hates my Mom and vice versa (he would've done anything to put a dent in her wallet, which is virtually impossible, ahaha).&nbsp; As&nbsp;I said, I had an absolute ball. That same time, I got news that I passed my PMR examination with flying colours. All the more reason to celebrate. When we arrived home on the 31st of December, Dad, Edgar and I went for lunch. During lunch, that m'fucker delivered the worst blow EVER.&nbsp;Conversation went like this:       &nbsp;   Dad: Boy, girl, there's something very important that I need to discuss with you.       &nbsp;   Edgar: What?       &nbsp;   E    dna: Erh, what? *Looks around for a fire exit, I thought a lecture was coming for the shopping bills)       &nbsp;   Dad: Aunty Sok "I'm a bitch" San is pregnant. (She;s my dad's gf, whom I absolutely loathe)       &nbsp;   Edgar: Huh?        &nbsp;   Edna: What the fuck? (Dad didn't mind me cussing then. DUH! Then the whole cussing thing began. I have the coolest parents on Earth. Mom curses bloody well in Chinese! HAHA!)       &nbsp;   Dad: She's 6 weeks' pregnant. *looks all noble* We didn't want to tell you before your holiday because we wanted you to enjoy the holiday.       &nbsp;   Edna: *bubbles of enlightenment filled my head thinking "No wonder he gave me cash for shopping, bloody hell, should've bought that Ralph Lauren Thai silk gown". Then it dawned on me* What the fuck? (it's all I can manage to stammer.)       &nbsp;   Edgar: *eyes opened wide*       &nbsp;   Dad: The baby was conceived in Argentina (we went for a trip in Argentina and South Africa in November, I loved that trip. That stupid bitch's Rolex got stolen! Hahah! As did Dad's. They were wearing matching ones. I was euphoric). So now we plan to get married. What do you think?       &nbsp;   Edgar: Okay, whatever.       &nbsp;   Edna: WHAT THE FUCK? You told me she's a fucking virgin and we should all follow her fucking example. And now she's pregnant? Who the fuck is she, Virgin Mary?       &nbsp;   Dad: Calm down. *Oh so casually* The wedding's tomorrow.       &nbsp;   Edgar & Edna: WHAT THE BLOODY FUCK? What's there to talk about?       &nbsp;    So it began. I hated my father since then. I had a bitch living in my house. She can't speak English for nuts. We ignore each other whenever possible.         &nbsp;   So yea, now, I'm stuck with a 11 month old sister (cute though) and stuff with Dad is cooling off. Aunty Sok San is still being ignored. And I love Mom. I'll be 16 in November. And hell, I have another examination coming up. The most important one, SPM on the 4th of November. Bloody hell.       &nbsp;   That pretty much sums up my life.       &nbsp;   Hhaha! Cheers peeps. Have a nice day!

       urlLink      Oh my fucking God. Don't you just hate Ashlee Simpson? I mean, hello, look at her. She's 19, sister of Jessica "I can't tell the diff between tuna and chicken" Simpson, she flashes her tits to sell her totally eardrum-erupting album. Honestly, when I first saw her video of the song, Pieces of Me, I felt like throwing the whole bowl of Maggi Mee (instant noodles) on her fake black hair. Bloody hell. Wannabe, annoying and hey, she trashes her famous dumb blonde sister. And I quote, "I'm definitely more street smart compared to Jessica" or s'thing along that lines. Like, wtf? Erh, haha, posting a picture of your royal brother is a different thing. At least I didn't do it on national tv. Well, back to Ashlee Simpson. She's plain fucking annoying. I mean, look! her tits are practically spilling out of her teeny weeny spaghetti-strapped top. She's not sexy, her cleavage looks plain unappetizing, and she doens't have the persona to pull it off. And bloody hell, another reality tv show. As if one bloody Simpson sister is not enough, the younger wannabe sister claims to want to overstep her sister's "shadow". Like, wtf? There wasn't a shadow. Nobody knew of her fucking existence.Which means nobody could cast a shadow over her coz she's plain non-existent. Until she flashed her tits, that is.   &nbsp; urlLink

       Did absolutely fucking nothing this    Monday   . Have absolutely nothing to bitch about..yet. So that means there wouldn't be much profanity today.    &nbsp;  1) Woke up at 6.47am.   2) Yell at Jason.   3) Decided not to go to school.   4) Went back to sleep.   5) Woke up for good at 1.33pm.   6) Brushed my teeth, showered.   7) Channel surfed while having breakfast in my room.   8) Went downstairs to watch this movie, High Crimes*.   9) Movie ended at 3.15pm.   10) Here I am, with Physics work in front of me.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;    *High Crimes      &nbsp;  Well, it wasn't too bad. Stars Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman, James Caviezel,&nbsp; AMANDA PEET...    &nbsp;  Check it out   urlLink    here     .    &nbsp;  Ashley Judd gave an okay performance. MORGAN FREEMAN WAS CLASSIC! Hahah, he plays this lawyer who underwent rehabilitation to curb his drinking problems. He's your typical pain in the arse black lawyer prick who plays the wild card. He's witty and smart. Classic, I tell you. No comments on James Caviezel. Amanda Peet was FUCKING hot! OMFG! She's&nbsp; so so so bloody hot. She plays sister to Ashley Judd in the movie. The movie has certain twists to it that wasn't as "chi kek" ( interesting) as expected. Not too bad to past time though. I certainly enjoyed Amanda Peet. Hahahah! Enough.    &nbsp;  I need to get back to Physics. So there.     &nbsp;  Cheers, have a nice day.     &nbsp;  Will post something later, that is, if it's anything worthy of mention.  &nbsp;

        Well, a perfectly boring Sunday.        &nbsp;    1) Woke up at about 11.58am.        &nbsp;    2) Went out with mom and Edgar to watch a movie.        &nbsp;    3) Watched this really, really stupid Singaporean movie, The Best Bet. It's funny in a crude way. You definitely need to understand Hokkien (a dialect) and Mandarin to actually enjoy the movie. It portrays the life of most Singaporeans who are addicted to lottery tickets in search of fast money. Hahaha! Eh Hyon Xhi, this is worse than the 4-D counters in Andalas.       4) Movie ended at about 4.10pm.        &nbsp;    5) Being perfectly late for my 3.30pm Math tuition, mom went speeding.        &nbsp;    6) Got to Sharm's house at about, 4.21pm/        &nbsp;    7) Had an absolute ball bitching around with Sharm and Lena while doing crappy Math work.        &nbsp;    8) Had a big big argument with Jas. It was bloody stupid, and yes, I think I hate him.        &nbsp;    9) Cried to mom. Talked to her about it. She promised to take me to A&amp;W on Tuesday after gym coz I've been absolutely craving a Coney Dog. Haha!        &nbsp;    10) Had dinner. Mom cooked coz we have to have dinner with my cute maternal grandmama at least once a week.        &nbsp;    11) Got back. Lazed around. Helped Edgar out with his tiara and crepe paper hair. HAHAHAH! Did I tell you? For his Theatre exam, he's playing the role of a princess. A princess with yellow crepe paper hair! HAHAHAHA! LMFAO! And we have to shred the crepe paper and paste it around a cardboard tiara. HAHAHAH! Edgar. You know Edgar? My fucking brother, Edgar. Shit. Hhahahah! Will try to get a picture out of this. His exam's on Tuesday.        &nbsp;    12) Showered. Wondered which shampoo to try next. Maybe the Multivitamin one from TIGI.        &nbsp;    13) Decided to go for a drink with Har and the big gang. Sheesh. Decided that Logeetha is beautiful. She got in to the semis at the Miss India Malaysia. Everyone thinks she has a good chance at winning.        &nbsp;    14) Saw the reigning Miss India Malaysia at Chicken mamak. Boy, she's fat. But pretty hot.        &nbsp;    15) Did practically nothing except bullshit the whole night.        &nbsp;    16) Went back at erh, 12 plus and watched Fear Factor.        &nbsp;    17) Slept at 3am after studying.        &nbsp;    There, that sums up my perfectly boring Sunday.

       OMG. I orgasmed 7 times in One Utama Shopping Centre( or rather, 2U to me). I was at the new wing. Shucks. They practically slashed all the prices into half at FCUK. AX wasn't too bad. But honestly, the Mango and Zara were like, dirt cheap.       Had a ball. But after a while, it got horrible. Too many people. I hate shopping with half of Malaysia. So anyway, got pissed halfway. I only managed to get a top and a skirt. From Zara and MNG. FCUK did not have anything nice. Got a pair of jeans for Jas though, naturally, he paid me back. Fuck it. I ain't spending a cent on him. Like, a pair of FCUKs for RM 144.50. What are the fucking odds honey? Hahah!       Fell in love with a pair of boardshorts from Rip Curl. Tried to persuade Mom into getting it, but she was insistent on not getting conned. Will try to go back next week to get those. Oh yes, and La Senza has some pretty hot lingeries. CHEAP! I mean, totally hot. That's about it. Got into a pretty bad mood after that.       At night, Jason and Andrew came over. We went for a drink with Edgar at MYOB. Came back. The two fuckheads(Ed and Jas) decided to go play pool and leave me behind coz there are "dangerous" crowds at the pool centre. So I decided to go play CS with Harvin and the gang. Had fun. It's bloody fun when you're high on fags and play CS after that. Went for mamak. GUESS WHAT?      I met fucking Jason with his fucking sister and godsister and FUCKING godbrother (I hate him, he's fucking shallow, no surprise though. He hasn't got enough brains to stuff up my pussy). I was with 8 FRIENDS (who happened to be guys, Indian, as I said, I have nothign against them, that's so racist). Well, Jason saw me with my friends. And he got mad. So we had an argument. His godbrother called me a slut because I was having a drink with my friends. WTF? So fucking happened that they were Indian guys. And I was the only Chinese. So what? Isn't that such a racist and sexist remark? No wonder Malaysia is still more or less a 3rd world country. With fuckheads like that.      I honestly don't see what's wrong. It could've been anyone. My girlfriends, classmates..whatever. Just so happened that I was hanging out with them yesterday. I do not see them as colours or guys. They are F-R-I-E-N-D-S. Well, I've had enough of being judged my whole life. C'mon, there's nothing I've never heard. OH WAIT, Jas's godbrother called me LOA. What's so fucking LOA about it? Having a drink with friends? Fucking racists. I wasn't even touching them. Much less fucking them on the table. Yes, as I was saying. What a fuckup. Being judged by people, it bounces off. But being judged like that with someone you thought you knew, whom you actually trust, man, that sucks REAL bad.       Well, it all comes back to this. You're always alone. No matter how many friends you think you have, you're alone. Oh yea, right, to those of you whom are in love, or infatuated, puh leez. Come over to my house for a bang in the balls or pussy. Whatever. I do believe in unconditional love. The one where you go, " Daddy, I'm going out. I need money". But that's all. Call me a cynic. Fuck it, I've had enough shit to tell you that. When you think you know someone so well, and they back out on you like that, man honestly, it BURNS. I wish I could say it, but I can't (coz women tend to be dependant on CERTAIN guys, like daddy). But since it's my blog, what the hell aye?       " I DON'T FUCKING NEED NO ONE, MUCH LESS A GUY"       Cheers peeps. Have a nice day!

       Haven't blogged in a long while, have I? Well, had a pretty average Friday.       1) Woke up, DRAGGED myself out of bed at 6.56am          2) Rushed to brush my teeth, get a shower and get dressed for school.          3) Slept in the car.          4) Got to school 1 minute late. The fucking prefects made me stand by the gate to await Rasul's (some prickass teacher) verdict. Thank God I had Joyce. Hahah!          5) Ended up picking up rubbish. Something weird happened that made me lose faith in ALL prefects. We were holding garbage bags. EMPTY ones. So the girls were picking up bits of rubbish like sweet wrappers and stuff like that. Hardly 3 minutes in, the bag still light as feather, two stupid Indian (I have nthing against Indians, my best friend is an Indian.) girls who were in Sec. 4 who were prefects still on probation said that we were done. And that we could go back to class. I was like, wtf? This place is hardly even clean. Though I hate picking up rubbish, I'm still a perfectionist at heart. I mean, just finish off what you started. And that stupid bitch was like, " What? You like to pick up rubbish arh? Slowly pick until the bag is full larh." with that stupid I'm-a-fucking-rude-slut-that-does-Daddy tone. Like, wtf?          6) Went to class feeling a lil crappy. Managed to survive the day with loads of sleep.          7) Had a ball with JEff and Hyon Xhi. Hahaha, they were seXXoring each other with newspapers. And I got seXXored by fucking Hyon xhi. Asshole.          8) Went for Add Math tuition. Came back. SleeeeeeeppP! I haven't been sleeping, seriously. Sheesh, my eyebags are PROMINENT, I tell you.          9) Went for BM tuition.           10) Came back. Made plans with Hyon Xhi for a drink. Harvin called. He asked me out for a drink. Got some mix up. In the end, all's well. Went out with Soo Guan and Hyon Xhi and we made Tosai Rawa Balls with Tomato Lamb Chutney Sauce on Tofu. For starters, we had lentil consomme. Hahah! Don't ask. We couldn't finish our suppers. So we decided to be gourmet chefs. Sucky ones. But we decorated the plate REALLY well. Sadly, we didn't bring our digicams. Sorry darlings. Another day. Promise.          11) It's now 2.51am on Saturday. I need to get some sleep. Off to fag myself to sleep darlings. Nitey.     Have a nice day!

Smells bloody good and fresh.  3) Jean Paul Gaultier EDP for Men. Somehow, this scent reminds me of London. Hahaha, Unca Spence uses this. It's fucking sexy, intoxicating.  4) Armani Mania EDT for Men. OH MY FUCKING GOD! Lots of airline crew uses this. Especially gay ones. But hey, it's fucking fucking orgasmic.  5) Paco Rabanne Ultraviolet EDT for Women. Oh I love this. One of the first few EDTs I own. And it comes in a cool package as well.  6) Love Sui EDT by Anna Sui. This is the ultimate girly scent. Feminine, sexy and fresh. Totally love this.

         Warning :  This is honestly solely for education purposes. I mean, hello! Hahah, this does NOT count as porn. Puh-leez. If you think this counts as porn, you must have been watching some pretty horrible ones. &nbsp;  urlLink          urlLink             What is Herpes?           Herpes     is a virus, specifically "herpesvirus hominus". Simplex is a sub-category of that family. Simplex falls into five categories, types 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. Generally type I infects the mouth in humans and type II affects the genital tract, but there is a substantial overlap. Type 6 and 7 cause an infection of infancy and Type 8 has been associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma which is seen in HIV.     Herpes     simplex virus (HSV) has a vast presence in humans. It has been estimated that some 80-90% of humans experience oral     herpes     infections by the age of ten years old. Many will have an acute episode manifesting as infected gums and lips, causing high fevers, but most apparently have few if any symptoms. A substantial portion of the population has recurrent oral     herpes         infection, showing up as those nuisance little "cold sores" on lips and sides of the mouth, and occasionally elsewhere on the face.      Transmission of Herpes      Someone with an HSV-1 lesion on the mouth can certainly transmit the infection to a significant other through oro-genital contact with the genitalia of the other (oral sex), causing a recurrent HSV-1 lesion on the genitalia of the partner. Also, other sites of HSV infection can be produced, such as on a finger (the so-called "herpetic whitlow") or elsewhere.      Okay people, enough already. I'm done. Seriously done. All those herpes-infested cocks are getting to me. Shit. I'm gonna go dry for a week.     &nbsp;   Have a nice day.     p/s: Check urlLink    this    and  urlLink   this    out for more information on Herpes.      pp/s: Hyon-Xhi has HERPES      urlLink

        Had a perfectly asswipe day. I mean, it's all I've been having.       &nbsp;   1) Woke up at 6.55am     2) Stared at the alarm clock to confirm that I'm seeing right.     3) Realisation dawned on me. (bloody hell, I'm fucking late for school)     4) Got ready SUPER fast.     5) Made it just in time for the car at about 7.06am (don't ask).     6) Got to school. Found out that no one came except Leng and Mel.     7) Had fun gardening. I planted mint, pulled out some weeds, stuck little placards listing the herbs in my school's Herb Garden.     8) Had a ball looking for snails! Haha. I hate them. So we found em and flung them out of school.     9) Went back to class. Got bored.      10) Sometime during English class, fucking Hyon Xhi cracked my fingers and numbed them. I couldn't feel them for 10 minutes. Bloody fucker.     11) Went to the gym. Worked out hard.     12) Went A&W for Coney Dogs with Mich, Andy and Dad.     13) Showered, cried, blogged.

She's got a beautiful voice and I should stop being shallow, but OMFG. Of all things to do, she has to marry a man old enough to be her grandaddy. Love...is fucking blind. I mean, hello, would you hump a 60 year old man?        &nbsp;      &nbsp;     Oh grandpa, do it to me...Pleaaaase....Ohhh yesss, Grandpa, yesss....Ahhhhh, that feels so good Grandpa.....*silence* Grandpa?

         Oh hey, had the perfect asswipe day today-what's new?       1) Woke up at 6.57am          2) Literally flew out of bed.          3) Headed for the shower.          4) Car came at 7.08am. Not bad eh?          5) Got to school. Had a bore.          6) Got news that someone "hates" me. Hahaha. It was something I said about being ripped off by that special someone.          7) So fine. Got ignored by Ms.-I-have-bigger-boobs-than-you-and-that-makes-you-subservient-to-me. Well, no big loss there. But you know, you feel all weird when you know someone ripped you off and is MAD at you. Like, wtf? Can't I speak my mind?          8) So yea, great. Had an absolute ball at assembly. Bombed that stupid gheyass prefect who looks like Jude Law in Artificial Intelligence (there, Drew, that abominable asshole who cari pasal). That asshole was over-exerting his authority. Got happy and felt superior for a while. Haha, sadistic.           9) Went to class. Managed to survive Suraya's English class (man i hate that bitch) and erh, I think a period of History. After that, hell, I was gone baby. So bloody boring. Had a ball peeling chicken flesh off it's bones in Leng's class with Leng and Joyce. Hanged out until school ended.          10) Came back. Went for tuition at 2.30pm. Was so so so bloody sleepy that I practically fell asleep writing my notes. I gave up writing notes and doodled on my test pad instead.          11) Got home. OMFG. I literally collapsed on the bed.           12) Woke up at about, 6.40pm for guitar class at 7.00pm          13) Shit. Got ABSOLUTELY annoyed with Ernest (my guitar teacher). He sounded like his little son, Matthew crapped on his dinner curry. Like, he was totally annoying. I was playing a piece. WHich sounded perfect to me coz I've been practising it VERY often. And he claims that I have to keep playing it coz I made many errors. Oh wait, maybe his son pissed on his ears. Fine. Then I learnt a new piece. Which sounded absolutely crappy when I played it coz I couldn't get the timing right. And Ernest kept bugging me to use the right fingers. The i m i m thingy. If you learn the guitar, you would understand eh San? So yes. Got bloody pissed. I can't even play the piece right, and he wants me to perfect the fingering. And my nose was running. I think I'm coming down with something.       14) Absolutely mad now. Really pissed at everyone. Need...to...get...some...sleep. Argh.

      Does something stink?  urlLink     urlLink     1) The durian fruit. Pungent, sweet, intoxicating. Hahaha, like ME!  2) That's what durians look like on the inside.  3) Me, enjoying my durian.  4) Hahahah! Letting my 11 month-old sister have a taste of her first durian. She hated it. Hahah. Too bad I couldn't get a picture of her expression.  5) Laughing at Neng's stupidity. Yes, that was his finger. Haha!  6) Edgar. OMFG. I honestly don't want to know what he's doing. Prolly eating-LITERALLY EATING *wink* his durian good. URGH.  Haha, had a ball with Neng's camera at his place yesterday. We had stew, roast and some pasta for dinner. Well, sorry. I haven't been blogging as often. And I'm planning to take off the themes. It's been hard keeping up with them.

       So  so so so bloody mad now. I have a feeling I can't get an appoinment with my hairstylist. I'm having crap hair that SOOO needs a cut. My "boyfriend" is a screwed insensitve fucked up asshole. I'm suffering from a BAD headache after last night. And I went for Jue Shea's party for nothing.      Yesterday was absolutely crap. I went to her party with the intentions of seeing my ex-classmates. But all that was there were the Form 5 Gods. So had a shitty time. Went back at about 12am.       Went over to Harvin's place at about 12.45am after watching TV. I was sad and tired thanks to Mr-Fucked-Up-Jas and that horrible headache. He and Roshen tried cheering me up with, guess what?            VODKA ON THE ROCKS!!      Taaddaaa. I had a shot coz my head was burning. I couldn't down more. I have pics though. Will post it up later. I think I got on a lil high. I felt VERY happy despite headache and all.   Got back at about 1.30am. Had a crying session thanks to my fucked up ""boyfriend". Hyon-Xhi, Ah Liang, Har, Roshen, you guys are right. This is stupid, being hooked like that.      OKAY PEEPS. GTG. GONNA SHOWER, THEN MAKE THAT BLOODY CALL TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. PRAY.

        Shit. I just made plans to go for Jue Shea's b'day party later on after tuition. This is becoming weird. It's more like a reunion for me. Coz I'll be meeting most of my ex-classmates. Like Lay Ling and God-knows-who. A bit weird actually. I practically do not talk to her in school. I mean, we were ex-classmates and all, but hell. Okay. Will blog more. Did I mention? I'm beginning to dig Evanescence. They're pretty much goth-emo-rock. Geddit? Haha! Good for you, Hyon-Xhi. Bloody emo bloke.

         Oh, yea baby. This is it. My Perfect Tits Award's acceptance speech.               #1 : I would like to thank all those out there, who've supported me over the years through ups and downs, small to BIG.               #2 : Not to mention, thank you to Princess Tam Tam from Blush! for never ending support, literally.              #3 : Special thanks to Evelyn Lee something (haha, sorry) for her words of wisdom and encouragement. No need to put yourself down. You're not bloody obese. Not even near. You're thinner than me. You have nicer legs.               4# :  Special thanks to Hyon Xhi for erh, correcting my fucking quote? Whatever dude, it sounds the same. And hey, you didn't need display my shallowness for the world to see. Who the fuck told you I dumped someone because their moobs were a lil bigger than mine? Hahaha! *looks around* *looks ultra lost*              5# : Thank you K Vin. Actually, I do eat dessert. I love dessert. Just not the weird ones they serve up front. I prefer the Economy Class desserts. They have stuff like strawberry mousse. Up front, they serve weird Banana Toffee gunk. Ew. Oh yes, I know I'm not skinny, but not PLUMP either. Hahah! How can I ever repay you? *muah muah* *blinks away some tears* *starts fanning my face* Oh yes, and those people from my chatterbox, they're not entirely STAR people. They come from different schools. But Klang people.              6# : A very BIG thank you to the Nice Kind Englishman, who has yet again proved how deep British people can be. Hahah, thank you.              7# : And Dead, what's  your name?              8# : Thank you Gav darling. I know.               9# : LASTLY, SANJEEV RAJ. No thank yous here! Hahaha, I'm offended. I HAVE perfect tits. Or else why would I be giving this acceptance speech anyway? Haha!                     Oh, isn't this a bit too long? Anyway, I've gotten past the PLUMP turd. My insecurities are over. Yay! Sheesh. Lame.        Now, let me fill you in on my day.          1) Woke up at about 6.45am          2) Came up with an ingenious plan coz I did not want to go to school. I can't stay home coz Dad and Edgar were in.          3) Called Harvin at about 6.53am to ask whether I could go over and sleep. He said yes, so I just walked over. He stays like, at the next block.          4) Went over. Slept in Jeswin's room. She wasn't around, you see.          5) Woke up at about 11am.           6) Brushed my teeth, washed my face, but couldn't get a shower coz I left my things at home.          7) So lazed around. Wanted to go for breakfast, or rather, brunch. Then I came up with the perfect solution. I OFFERED TO MAKE SOME FRY UP FOR BREAKFAST! Yay! Lucky boys (Harvin and Roshen).          8) We had potatoes and onions, fried up in butter until almost crisp. And scrambled eggs (I make perfect scrambled eggs) and bread. Harvin did not have sausages or ham. So we had to make do with those. Was yum though.          9) Hanged out. Played some Playstation. Some stupid game called Grand Tourismo. Like, hell, it sucks.          10) Came back at about 1.30pm. SKipped tuition. Ta daa. Blogging my life away.          Did I mention? I was watching Sex and The City yesterday from 10pm til 2pm. Hell, it's good. Hahah! Had a ball. Learnt something new. Za Za Zsu. Which is like, butterflies in your stomach. Cute aye?

        I NEED FEEDBACK.          Yesterday, I was on the phone with Jas. And he told me that his friends, the aforementioned one, the ones who were sexist, racist and shallow? He said that they said I was  PLUMP . Like, WTF?           #1 : NO BLOODY  PERSON WITH SELF RESPECT USES THAT WORD, IT'S BETTER OFF ELIMINATED FROM THE DICTIONARY.          #2 : I'M SO NOT PLUMP. I LOOK PLUMP COZ I HAVE WAAAAAY BIGGER BOOBS COMPARED TO THEM. WHICH ACCORDING TO HYON XHI, DOESN'T BEFIT MY SIZE COZ I AM PETITE, THOUGH IT'S GOOD, HAHA! JUST BECAUSE I HAVE THE ASSETS AND TENDENCY TO BECOME AN ASIAN PORN SUPERSTAR, IT DOESN'T MAKE ME PLUMP.          #3 : I'VE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS COZ THEY DO NOT HAVE TITS AS PERFECT AS MINE. AND THAT THEY'RE STUCK WITH BLOODY MINUS MINUS A CUP BRAS. AND THAT THEY HAVE MOOBS LIKE HYON XHI'S (MOOBS=MEN'S BOOBS). AND THAT NOBODY STARES AT THEIR NON-EXISTENT TITS.          Okay, I feel much better. Hahaha, tell me what you guys think about my size. I ain't that fat right? Right? Right? Feeling a lil pissy and annoying right now.
