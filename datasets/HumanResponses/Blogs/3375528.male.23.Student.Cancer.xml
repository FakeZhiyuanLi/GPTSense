      There is a need for the censorship of broadcast media however, if censorship proceeds with no limits, broadcasters will have their first amendment rights infringed upon. The freedoms of the first amendment guarantee the freedom of speech and press through the United States Constitution. Under no circumstances should the rights guaranteed under the constitution ever become marginalized. If the bill of rights becomes marginalized a precedent is set to further reduce the rights given Americans for any reason the government sees fit.  	The debate over media censorship is focused on the definition of indecent. More so what exactly can be considered an indecent topic for broadcasters. This concept of indecent is a complex idea to comprehend. Mostly the term is complicated because there is not a set definition indecent. The parameters of the term vary from person to person depending on values and personal opinions. Indecent as defined by websters.com “offensive to good taste; unseemly” as well as “offensive to public moral values; immodest.” No exact concrete definition can exist because the definition rests on opinions. What exactly can be considered good taste? What is and is not considered good taste changes from person to person. Public moral values vary from area to area throughout the country. In New York city the idea of public moral values much more loosely contrived then say the public moral values of a small bible belt town.   	The first amendment does not suffer from any ambiguity. The amendment is clear direct and concretely defined. Directly defined by the Cornell Law WebPages, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exchange thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” The language in the first amendment is clearly designed to prevent any misinterpretation. The design of this amendment has allowed to remain relevant for today’s society. If the bill of rights had not been designed in that manner, the amendment would have become ill relevant long ago. The only terms that are excluded by the bill are so called fighting words and obscenity. Fighting words encompass hate rhetoric. Also included is the theater example, i.e. the yelling of fire in a crowded theater that is not on fire is subject to persecution. Obscenity can also be persecuted under the first amendment because it offers no substantive value. Currently as defined any infringement of speech on a broadcaster is a violation of their first amendment rights, unless the subject matter can be considered obscene or hate rhetoric.  	The most confusing aspect of this situation is the FCC has no authority to restrict the airways. The commission was created solely to manage the broadcast spectrum so that two stations were not broadcasting on the same signal too closely. In addition, the FCC is also in charge of delegating the call letters out for stations. The telecommunications act of 1934, the act that created the FCC explicitly limits the FCC’s ability to restrict any content broadcasted. The Communication Act of 1934, (SEC. 326. [47 U.S.C. 326]) States; “Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station, and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication.” Thus the FCC does not have the legal ability to regulate the content of broadcast media or the ability to define what it considers indecent for broadcast.  The duality of content creates the inability to regulate indecency. Under certain contexts a subject may be taboo, but in another light the same subject no longer is considered taboo. Sexual conversations are a prime example of this duality. A show can discuss graphic sexual topics under the guise of being a clinical show. Conversely, sexual topics cannot be discussed merely for humor purposes. Certain words cannot be uttered either. However, the actual intent of the word can be expressed as long as the actual word is bleeped. Why is it that the actual word is considered inappropriate but the intent behind the word is acceptable? If I were to type, you stupid motherFer, my meaning is clear without actually typing the word. How is that any less or more indecent than saying the word?  The selective attempts to illegally regulate broadcast media only weaken the cause. If one show is able to talk about any topic without being fined while another is fined off the air dissonance will arise. Because there is no definition of what is indecent, there is no way to classify content as indecent. Therefore, any regulation on “indecent” material is serves only to restrict the amendments guaranteed in the first amendment. In addition to denying the first amendment, this censorship is illegal because the FCC has no jurisdiction to fine. 	  	Understanding the roots of the censorship battle is imperative to understanding why this sudden censorship has occurred. For years radio stations have operated without any serious regulations. Only recently has the content of the shows come under scrutiny of the public and the FCC. The transition from insignificant to becoming a huge political issue is a very complex one. One simple event seems to have sparked all of the debate over broadcast decency. In reality that event was merely a catalyst, which set off this chain reaction. Preceding, the catalyst was the complicated development of a political and social environment that would support the “crackdown.”  	The catalyst occurred at the Superbowl, with the baring of Janet Jackson’s breast. The event played out during the halftime show, for most viewers very unexpectedly. Many families had children that were watching the show. These families were not pleased their children were exposed to a woman’s form in this manner. Expectedly these families were outraged at the lack of sensitivity towards family values. The outraged families then complained to the network as well as the FCC. They demanded that action be taken to prevent this type of neglect in the future.  	Most of these families were not in the habit of complaining about media broadcasts. However, there exists a small group of the religious right that are constantly complaining about indecent broadcasts. This religious right is usually ignored because their demands are usually absurd or unrealistic. Because this event occurred with the nation watching, both families and the religious right were outraged in unison. The fact that the two very different groups were briefly unified made delineating between the two very difficult. The reason the groups need to be distinguished apart, lies in their demands. Offended families want to make sure that the type of event that occurred does not occur in the future, especially if children are watching. The religious right on the other hand wants to censor media so it fits to their belief system instead of changing the channel. They feel indecent material is a sin and crusade against any form of free expression they find offensive. Because of the volume of complaints, the FCC felt that they had to assure the public this would not happen in the future. Because it was impossible to differentiate between the source of complaints the FCC began to crisis manage and handled most complaints regardless of the source.  	The religious right as well as other advocacy groups desiring to control the media began complaining much more often. These complaints however meaningless were all treated with utmost importance.  	Another underlying primer, which helped create this environment, is the government. The FCC being an arm of the government and thus the government was well aware that the public was generally outraged. The government realized the outrage as a potential political tool. Specifically people focusing on media decency drew the general publics attention away from the war. The war efforts in Iraq were not going as planned and the general public began to withdraw support for the war. Support for the war was directly tied to the president because of his claims about Iraq. At that point no weapons had been found and Saddam was still at large. By drawing the public’s attention to another topic, people were not thinking about Iraq as much. The support for the war and the president stabilized briefly because citizens were concerned different topics.  Clinton attempted the same type of maneuver during the Lewinsky scandal, by bombing Iraq. His attempt to move attention from the presidential scandal did not work nearly as well. The attempt failed because it was created. Clinton made the decision to bomb Iraq and the public saw that as an attempt to change focus. The Jackson incident was not created or anticipated by the Bush administration. Therefore, Bush was able to push the crackdown, without being thought as an attempt to shift focus.  Bush’s personal values, as a born again Christian, resonated very well with the indecency crack down. This furthered his personal incentive to see the elimination of indecent media. His values also then make it more acceptable for the religious right to be outspoken and heard.  This situation also offers a rare chance for the government to enhance propaganda options. The USA like all governments feeds the media propaganda. This propaganda allows the government to easily accomplish goals and objectives with little resistance. In order to get propaganda to the masses a medium is needed. The more pliable the medium is the more effectively the propaganda can be spread. By cracking down broadcasters that are critical of the administration, a certain environment is created. Any opposing view will be fined heavily and removed. Therefore, opposing views are held silent. Since broadcasters supporting the administration are not fined they remain on air. The government then has a control over the major medium for propaganda delivery. Howard Stern the most heavily fined of the broadcasters so far had been a harsh critic of Bush and his policies. Michael Savage is a right political host who was recently hired by Clear Channel. Savage has a history of going on air and speaking negatively of homosexuals, using rhetoric that could be considered obscene. Stern has kept the same style show for years, all of the sudden he is being fined and has lost job security. Savage is largely untouched despite indecent broadcasting. Savage is also a political proponent of the Republican Party and the Bush administration. Howard is not. If this propaganda model is allowed to develop, freedom of speech and press could be lost forever.  It should be noted that without all of the elements in place the environment for crackdown could not of existed. Often in the past there have been incidents of indecent material being broadcast. DC101’s morning show only recently began to use a dump. Before the dump it was possible to curse over the air. There were never any fines levied on the station or show. Simple curse words apparently do not incur the wrath of the FCC. However, when Bono from U2 said fuck at the Grammies is created a national scandal. Both broadcasts used the same poor language only one got national attention. Because the Superbowl is considered family programming, and is watched by the entire nation, a certain level of decency is expected. When that expectancy was violated it out raged the nation. The Halftime show did occur after 10 pm at which point there are no broadcast laws. Technically after 10pm a television station could broadcast hardcore porn with no repercussions from the government. However the repercussions from advertisers and viewers would be devastating.  The news media holds a large responsibility in the matter. News organizations realized that this was a ratings getter and focused on this incident. The government helped the situation by continuing to find broadcasts indecent. The reason the crack down has continued is because the parties control are benefiting. The government is developing a propaganda machine. The news media is getting better ratings with indecency topics. Finally people are also beginning to feel like the indecency crackdown is making for cleaner television and radio.    Throughout this nightmare radio had gotten the brunt of the FCC’s fines. Jocks such as Howard Stern, Bubba the Love Sponge and Elliot Segal have been fined or fired for shows they broadcast that was determined to be indecent. Largely, these fines were brought about not by a universal outrage. Unlike the Superbowl incident most of the radio indecency fines originate from a single complaint. These individuals are actively asserting control over broadcasting. They are not acting with the public’s interests in mind. Instead they are operating with ulterior religious motives.  However impossible to change the situation may look, there are many potential solutions. The solutions vary in complexity. It is very possible that a solution may not work but it is imperative that this situation be reversed. One way to potentially reverse this crackdown is to remove the FCC ability to fine. The FCC does not have the legal ability to fine for a reason. A conflict of interest exists when the same organization is in charge of licensing and regulating. The fact that there are no rules to the fining system the FCC has implemented is enough reason to stop the FCC from fining. An “indecent” show can air on several stations with only one station incurring a fine. No clear amount of fine has been decided either. Amounts are completely subjective to the FCC. This is like allowing cops to pull you over for speeding when there is no sign and issuing a ticket with a subjective amount. The speed that gets pulled over will vary from day to day and the amount varies just as much. No one would ever stand for that type of governmental abuse. These actions are too similar to the past secret police of Russia and Germany. How then can an entity of this nature exist in our government?   The fact that there is not a clear definition of indecent is another reason to strip the FCC the ability to fine. It would be much more effective if broadcaster developed a set of standards that could not be abused. A universal broadcasting policy designed to remove needless shock from the air. The broadcast standards could include certain situations where more shocking broadcasting is allowed. Broadcasters watching broadcasters would be more effective then having a government entity regulating broadcasters. The punishment for violating decency standards would be up to the industry. Self-regulation would be effective in this industry because the public is watching. Therefore if a broadcaster were being indecent or obscene then the public outcry would force an action. The punishment need not necessarily be monetary; in some cases alternative punishment could be implemented. Community Service on the broadcasters part or even, offering airtime for public interest shows and PSAs could be alternative solutions.  Therefore punishing broadcaster could result in helping the community. The system now only benefits the government. The fines are not put into the offended community. The fines use is up to the discretion of the FCC.  Eliminating the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed restrictions on radio ownership, could also help. If radio stations are run by small companies local to a few communities greater concern for the community would be demonstrated. Now only three companies dominate the radio industry. These are huge national companies that cannot be bothered with the concerns of some of the smaller markets. Eliminating them would return the care for the smaller markets. It is also much easier to monitor stations that are not part of a huge company. The entire regulation process becomes streamlined because the operation is much smaller.  Clearly defining what exactly indecent and obscene are is another step to remedying this situation. Terms deemed indecent are not excluded by the first amendment. Thus they can be spoken in any medium legally. Obscenity is not protected by the constitution and thus subject to persecution. As of now the term are both loosely defined with no concrete definition. To regulate them a clear direct definition of what is indecent and obscene is needed.  Another option would be to put the ability to censor in the publics hand. This was the method of regulating media of the past. It was very successful because it relies on free market business theory. A product that is not marketable does not stay on the consumer market. The viewer has a decision to make when offensive material is broadcast. If the viewer changes the channel then ratings will drop. Advertisers do not get a return on advertising if a show is not watched. Therefore advertisers do not put commercials on shows with poor ratings. The show being unprofitable is either fixed or canceled. Instead of involving the government, the consumers are directly regulating what is on the air.   This method has the added benefit of being the most regulated. Because the consumers are using action instead of complaints, the ability of one group to alter media content becomes marginalized. In the current system if a group complains enough action it taken by the FCC. Indecent or not the FCC will go after a broadcaster if these right wing groups complain enough. By allowing the consumer to right to decide what is decent, the popular desire of the nation is reflected. Shows like Howard Stern and Elliot in the morning remain on the air by this principal. Lots of people do not like the shows, but they are not forced to watch it. If Stern offended his entire audience, he would be removed from the air.  	The reality of the situation is complex. It is a fact if we allow the government to regulate speech in broadcast, the regulations will suppress our right to free speech. By letting the FCC operate illegally the American people are giving up the right to think freely and decided what is decent. Eventually, even more rights erode as governmental agencies become more powerful. Recently there was a vote in congress potentially allowing the FCC jurisdiction over satellite television and radio. If laws such as this are allowed to pass the arms of jurisdiction will encompass all forms of media and expression 	Now is the time to act. Howard Stern has remained on air by open accusing the FCC of operating with a political agenda. He has also gotten support from listeners in reporting the “indecency” of shows like Oprah. Her show talks about the same topics as Stern’s but is not subject to the governmental crack down.   	The freedoms guaranteed in the Bill of Rights some of the most precious freedoms and rights given anywhere in the world. As a result they are constantly under attack as groups try to remove them. The Patriot Act has set the civil rights movement back and caused more harm then it will ever protect. We have to unite as country and be heard. The voices of small advocacy groups and governmental desires are not protected but soon will be if we the majority allow our wants to be marginalized by the minority.
