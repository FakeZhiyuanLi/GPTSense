      I was downstairs watching the Olymipics with my father. Some girl had won the gold in gymnastics, and she was being interviewed and asked if she wanted to have done anything differently and such. Well, the dogs start barking, so I get up and let them go outside. While I'm letting them run out the back door, my father changes the channel to Becker. As I head back, I hear from the tv screen, " You don't know what you're doing! Just admit it! ADMIT IT! *slap!* "  The only thing I can say is "Man, what the hell's gotten into Bob Costas?"  --------------  I went to that "Big Brother" thing today. It was quite the sroty, let me tell you. However, I'm quite tired tonight after a long day. I'll update this weekend with the whole story.

      Don't ever read. Ever. It's not worth it. In fact, take every opportunity you have to burn any book you come across. Do the world a favour.  In related news, I read about 250 pages in my summer reading in about 2 hours to finally  finish,  and now my mind is  fried.  All I got to do is write a short little 5 page report and I'm done. There's the matter of the test on the book I never even opened this Friday, but I'll just cheat or something.  ...don't get me wrong, cheating is bad, it hurts more than it helps, education is important, and all that jazz, but sometimes you just don't  care.  Apathy's never a good thing, but I don't feel like stopping it anytime soon (see how vicious a cycle it causes?).  On second thought, I think I'll just resort to good old fashioned cramming. Nothing like a good cram session to wear out the brain and make sure that I won't remember anything in the book ever. I'll read it eventually...just not now.  I feel like adding a drawing to this because...well, I feel like adding a drawing to this. I don't really have any sroties for today since most of it was spent reading and sleeping, but I'd feel bad for not including something. So, here's a picture of The Punisher I drew in MSPaint (as usual) for Moon Kitsune, if I remember the screenname correctly. This was for a MSPaint request thread I did last week; I could have done better, but it came out ok considering how fast I went.     Although MSPaint's fun (really, it is), I need to start using good old pen and paper more often. Maybe if I can actually find a place to put my stupid scanner, I can make use of it. That is if I can figure out how to make it stop saving 20 10MB files at a time...

      I've been reading "A Confederacy of Dunces" lately. It's a very hillarious book, and I've laughed aloud a number of times at the events that have unfolded, and stayed up late at night to finish one more chapter. But as I was reading last night, I found myself striking a comparison between me and the book's main character, Ignatius J. Reilly.  As this summer draws to a close, I find myself looking back at what I've done. I attempted to get a job, but through mishaps and a few of my own blunders, nothing came of it. I had avoided school work at all possible costs, more focused on what I thought to be things that were "intellectually stimulating." I've written a few heavily worded editorials and reflections, drawn for hours on pads of paper that litter my desk and on my computer, and dreamed up theories of grand purpose in the universe; none of these things to ever be seen by anyone but myself. Yet I continue to put off all that is practical and necissary to further my own creative needs.  Ignatius fancies himself an intellectual. A renaissance man born out of his time, and an observer to society. I can't say that I blame him. I often feel that I know far more about what I should be doing and how things are supposed to work than anyone else does, that I've tapped into some fountain of celestial knowledge, enlightening me with the true knowledge of the mysteries of our world. But what do I know? I'm a 17 year old boy with a big vocabulary and lot of time on his hands. Surely, I remain on the same level as others of my age, despite what pompus ideas I have just because "I'm a unique individual."  Still, this feeling of anachronism and self-importance that I have keeps me from doing what needs to be done, and what I now struggle to do, as time runs short for me. I feel as if I am exempt from these rules and regulations, assignments and duties; that my true purpose is to create, and to study, and to be at ease. I must admit, this is only an excuse I have made for myself, that the only obstacle between me and getting my tasks done is myself, and that coming up with these grand, abstract feelings and emotions only hinder my progress of getting my work done.  But at least I'm not fat.  ------------  (edit: I'm using part of this for an essay I'm doing on the book. So if a teacher scans the internet and finds this and tries to give me a 0 for plagerism...it's me, Mendoza. I really wrote this. Please don't fail me. ;_; )

      I get this call earlier today, telling me to show up at school Thursday at 5:45 in full uniform. School doesn't start until Friday, but I assumed this was some generic "senior initiation" thing.  As it turns out, that wasn't the case. Thursday is the 8th grader's initiation. The only reason a senior would go is if he signed up for the Big Brother/Big Sister program where you basically have to babysit the 8th graders and let them follow you around at lunch and after school.  I didn't sign up for this. But that doesn't matter.  Our principal, Ms. Hall, making great strides towards making the school look good to everyone else while making the students feel miserable, has made this program  manditory.  So now, I'm forced to drag whoever this kid'll be around everywhere and be forced to "show him the ropes", as it were.  I feel bad for the kid though; I don't DO a hell of a lot outside of classes. Sure, in class I'll be doing all kinds of spontanious and interesting things, but lunch and afterschool is devoted to relaxing, listening to music, and sometimes doing the school work I neglected to do in class. Other kids are in band, or in sports, or one of those weird abstract clubs that do things for the community. Me? I lounge around in the math teacher's room and doodle while everyone else practices academic games. Not very interesting for the little bright eyed 8th grader.  It's not the first change Ms. Hall's brought about this year. The vending machines will now be shut down for most of the day. In fact, they made it as sort of a competition now to see if you can get a candy bar or not. The vending machines (including drink dispensers) will be on for only twice a day for 10 minutes and at, more or less, the most inconvient times possible. So now the revenue on the machines will go down, and they'll be gone for good. But that's ok, because the lunches there are really good.   Oh wait.  They got rid of all the lunches in place of "archdiocese approved" lunches. Say hello to frozen two-fer patties stored in the back rooms for about 3 months! =D  Well, I'll live. Worse comes to worse, I'll bring in my own bag lunches full of all the crap I could possibly want, while everyone else chokes on 4 month old stale chicken nuggets with the consitancy of a skipping stone. I won't be sharing any of my lunch with the 8th grader though; the little bugger has to learn to fend for himself in the wilderness of High School.
