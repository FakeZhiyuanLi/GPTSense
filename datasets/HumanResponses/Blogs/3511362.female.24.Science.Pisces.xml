      The Scientist July 26, 2004  http://www.biomedcentral.com/news/20040726/01  Govt: No grad student unions  US NLRB says students at private universities can't organize, but groups vow to push on | By Alison McCook As teaching and research assistants from across North America gathered this weekend (July 22–25) for the annual meeting of the Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions, the recent US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling earlier this month against students working at Brown University was a hot topic.  Attendee Maris Zivarts, a graduate student in biology at Yale and a member of the Graduate Employees and Students Organization—which also seeks to be recognized as a union—told The Scientist that delegates "overwhelmingly" voted to pass a resolution to use "all possible avenues" to reverse the decision and extend the benefits of unionization to graduate students.  He added that many graduate students also formed a picket line on Friday outside the New York offices of the NLRB to protest the decision. "There were a couple hundred graduate students walking in the rain," he said.  The decision, which applies to all private universities, reversed the NLRB's decision 4 years ago under the Clinton administration that let graduate assistants at New York University unionize. This time, the board ruled that graduate assistants are students, not employees, which prevents them from organizing.  Mark Nickel, director of the news service at Brown, said that the university has made the same argument over the years, and "we're pleased that the NLRB found it persuasive." Nickel noted that Brown is not opposed to unions, and has been "dealing successfully" with union groups representing other staffers like food service workers. The university is also willing to talk to graduate students about their issues, he said, but unions are for workers, not students.  Although the current decision reverses a previous one, the NYU case reversed over 25 years of precedent, during which graduate assistants were not regarded as employees, University of Pennsylvania spokesperson Lori Doyle told The Scientist. Students come to Penn for an education, Doyle said: "They don't come here to get a job."  The NLRB decision stems from Brown's dispute of the results of a 2001 election, in which 450 graduate students employed as research assistants, teaching assistants, and proctors voted on whether to join the United Auto Workers union. The university impounded the results before they could be counted.   A similar scenario has played out on other campuses. At another union vote among graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania last year, Lauren Nauta, a graduate student in the history department at Penn, told The Scientist that exit polls suggested that at least 60% had voted to join a union. Penn impounded the ballots, and the exact result remains unknown.  And in April, Columbia graduate students who work as teaching and research assistants went on strike after the university refused to recognize the results of an election, in which the majority decided to join a union by signing membership cards.  Graduate students need unions because unions legally require the university to recognize and negotiate with students "in good faith," Maida Rosenstein, president of local 2110 of the United Auto Workers union, which includes graduate assistants at New York University, told The Scientist.  "I think a union is absolutely essential because it has teeth," David Wolach, a fifth-year graduate student in the Columbia Philosophy Department and member of the union, known as Graduate Student Employees United, told The Scientist.  Penn's Nauta told The Scientist said that the NLRB ruling was split along party lines, with Republicans in the majority opinion and Democrats dissenting. One Republican board seat will become available in the coming months, she said, and a change in administration could change the board's majority opinion.  Yale's Zivarts noted that students can form a union without NLRB certification. Although this would mean that students can't turn to support from the NLRB in case of a strike or employer misconduct, the NLRB's inability to resolve disputes with universities in a timely manner has turned him off of the organization. The NLRB "hasn't helped us any," he said.

      THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  By BERNARD WYSOCKI JR.  July 27, 2004; Page B1  http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB109087357506874146,00.html    Sunita B. Jones, a 33-year-old with a doctorate in urology, works at a leading institution on research into prostate cancer: Stanford University's medical school. But within the next six months, the published scholar and postdoctoral fellow plans to abandon academia in favor of a higher-paying consulting or venture-capital job. Dr. Jones says she is disillusioned with the increasingly cutthroat battle for funding from the National Institutes of Health, the main benefactor for university research. "The whole atmosphere in research is so bad," she complains.   Her boss is disappointed but sympathetic. James Brooks, a Stanford assistant professor of urology,says he is struggling to win NIH grant money himself and worries whether he will have enough funds to keep his lab going. As the competition for government grants gets tighter, young scientists increasingly are quitting academia, which in turn is causing a wave of anxiety in the ranks of biomedical research. These scientists, armed with Ph.D.s, serve as cheap labor for universities, spending between four and eight years working under their mentors as so-called post-docs, on salaries that are usually funded by NIH grants and amount to less than $50,000 a year.   The U.S. has about 17,000 biomedical post-docs -- and their typical ambition is to remain at an academic institution, but to win their own grants, build a lab, get tenure at a university and keep pursuing science. The federal government is a major source of funding for scientific research at universities in the U.S. In the biomedical field, the NIH is by far the biggest donor of this money. Universities and their faculty compete fiercely for these billions of dollars in research grants. The funds are an important part of their budgets.   But these young scientists are important for another reason: often they have the most original ideas. Scientific history -- in biology, physics, chemistry and other disciplines -- is replete with examples of scientists making huge breakthroughs in their 20s and 30s. Albert Einstein's four seminal physics papers were produced at age 26. James Watson, co-discoverer of the double helix structure of DNA, did his most astonishing work in his early 30s. Jonas Salk spent eight years, between ages 33 and 41, developing the polio vaccine, announced in 1955.   "If there's one thing that keeps me awake at night, it's the young investigators," says NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, whose staff is grappling with ways to reward top young scientists in order to keep them in the research fold.   The NIH budget has doubled -- to $28 billion a year -- since 1998, with more than 80% spent on research projects outside the walls of NIH. This year, it rose less than 3%. Meanwhile, the number of scientists seeking grants has skyrocketed, so a smaller percentage are receiving funding. At the National Institute of Mental Health, director Thomas Insel says that the top 15% of proposals are now being funded, down from roughly 25% just a few years ago. Many of those turned down, Dr. Insel says, come from young scientists with highly innovative ideas.   Younger scientists are often being squeezed out by veteran scientists with established track records, or by big multi-disciplinary projects that give little recognition to young scientists trying to carve careers as research stars. One area of greater NIH spending is biodefense, including large projects such as biocontainment labs that research infectious diseases and pathogens that could be turned into weapons, as well as possible vaccines and other therapies to treat them.   Even researchers outside universities are feeling the pinch. At the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which relies on NIH funding for about two thirds of its budget, officials are looking for other sources of money and will soon launch a major fund-raising drive. So far, Salk, based in La  Jolla, Calif., hasn't followed the pattern of the nearby Scripps Research Institute, which has forged a close partnership with drug giant Novartis AG. The 1993 deal, controversial at the time, gave Scripps, a nonprofit biomedical research organization, $300 million over 10 years in return for supplying research to Novartis.   At Salk, the reliance on NIH money is large and anxiety provoking. "The general idea is panic," says Andrew Dillin, a 33-year-old genetics specialist. When Dr. Dillin arrived at Salk in 2002, he submitted a proposal for a large NIH grant, and was turned down twice. He successfully applied for a second grant, for $2 million over five years. But since he has to finance himself and an eight-person lab, he is constantly struggling to win more money. He has $120,000 from the American Diabetes Association, for example, and he has a slice of a big NIH project valued at $150,000. But Dr. Dillin says it is the smaller projects he has initiated himself that generate the possible scientific breakthroughs.   Some eminent scientists fear the loss of exceptionally good researchers altogether. At the National Academy of Sciences, Nobel laureate Thomas Cech of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute has convened workshops to look at the plight of young scientists. At a meeting in Washington last month, Dr. Cech  spoke of a young X-ray crystallography expert who made numerous breakthroughs, published his findings, but couldn't get NIH funding from skeptical peer reviewers. After five years of effort, the scientist gave up completely, and is pursuing another passion, teaching in an inner-city school.   On campus, the sudden flattening of the NIH budget has caught much of the research community by surprise. "We attracted a bunch of people into the system, and then all of a sudden the system's contracting," says Lawrence Goldstein, a senior scientist at the University of California at San Diego.   Dr. Jones says that from the time she was a 10-year-old growing up in India, she wanted to be a research scientist. After getting bachelor's and master's degrees in Bangalore, she got a Ph.D at the University of South Florida, then won a highly prized slot at Stanford three years ago, to work in the lab of Dr. Brooks. She says she will use her skills outside academia. "I don't want to lose the link with research, although I don't see myself hunched over the bench," she says.   Dr. Brooks says that many of his post-doctoral proteges "aren't necessarily happy" in the business world. They feel "diminished," he says, for having given up "pursuit of an idea for pursuit of the bottom line." Despite the obstacles, many young scientists remain committed to pursuing an academic career. At Harvard University, 30-year-old Kerri Mowen does research on T-cells, which play a vital role in the functioning of the body's immune system. She has already won an initial three-year NIH grant, and is working on her first major NIH proposal.   Because infectious disease is a high priority for NIH funding in the wake of terrorist attacks and the SARS outbreak, "I'll probably fare better than the people studying cancer, because studying the immune system is more relevant to infectious disease," Dr. Mowen says.

      http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=0009973A-D518-10FA-89FB83414B7F0000   July 26, 2004   Questions That Plague Physics: A Conversation with Lawrence M. Krauss   Lawrence M. Krauss speaks about unfinished business     Chair of the physics department at Case Western Reserve University,  Lawrence M. Krauss is famed in the research community for his prescient  suggestion that a still mysterious entity called dark energy might be the  key to understanding the beginnings of the universe. He is also an  outspoken social critic and in February was among 60 prominent scientists  who signed a letter entitled "Restoring Scientific Integrity in  Policymaking," complaining of the Bush administration's misuse of science.  The public, though, might know him best as an op-ed writer and author of  books with mass appeal. His 1995 work, The Physics of Star Trek, became a  best-seller, translated into 15 languages. He is now finishing his seventh  popular title, Hiding in the Mirror: The Mysterious Allure of Extra  Dimensions, which he describes as "an exploration of our long-standing  literary, artistic and scientific love affair with the idea that there are  hidden universes out there." Krauss recently discussed his many scientific  and social passions with writer Claudia Dreifus.   SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN: What are the top questions bedeviling physicists today?   LAWRENCE KRAUSS: Three that I find fascinating are: What is the nature of  dark energy? How can we reconcile black hole evaporation with quantum  mechanics? And, finally, do extra dimensions exist? They are all connected.  And they are all going to require some new insights into quantum gravity.  But someone is going to have to come up with a totally new and remarkable  idea. And it's hard to predict when that is going to happen. In 1904 you  couldn't have predicted that Albert Einstein would come up with a  remarkable idea in 1905.  I think the resolution to these problems is likely to be theoretical and  not experimental. This is because direct experimental signatures that might  point us in the right theoretical directions in these areas probably lie  beyond the realm of current experiments. I'd also bet that the solution to  these problems is not going to resemble anything being done now, including  string theory.   SA: Is string theory the physics equivalent of The God That Failed, as some  people used to say about communist ideology?   LK: Not exactly. But I do think its time may be past. String theory and the  other modish physical theory, loop quantum gravity, both stem from one  basic idea: that there's a mathematical problem with general relativity.  The idea is that when you try to examine physical phenomena on ever smaller  scales, gravity acts worse and worse. Eventually, you get infinities. And  almost all research to find a quantum theory of gravity is trying to  understand these infinities. What string theory and what loop quantum  gravity do is go around this by not going smaller than a certain distance  scale, because if you do, things will behave differently. Both these  theories are based on the idea that you can't go down to zero in a point  particle, and that's one way to get rid of mathematical infinities. The  main difference, I think, between the two theories is that string is  intellectually and mathematically far richer.  String theory hasn't accomplished a lot in terms of solving physical  problems, but it's produced a lot of interesting mathematical discoveries.  That's why it fascinates. Loop quantum gravity hasn't even done that, at  least in my mind.    "We live in a society where it's considered okay for intelligent people to  be scientifically illiterate."   SA: Are you saying that string theory hasn't really gotten us anywhere?   LK: Neither string theory nor loop quantum gravity has told us much about  the key unsolved physical problems--most important, why does the universe  have dark energy? That's the biggest question right now. One thing that has  come out of string theory is the idea of plural universes or extra  dimensions, and that's because string theory is based on extra dimensions.  The only consistent string theory originally had 26 dimensions, and then it  got lowered to 10. But the universe we live in is four-dimensional [three  spatial plus time]. A lot of talk went into explaining how all these extra  dimensions were invisible. Recently some people have been trying to turn  that defect into a virtue by suggesting that the extra dimensions might  actually be detectable.   SA: You've just finished writing a book about parallel universes. Do you  think they're real?   LK: Let me answer you this way: it's an exciting area, and it's wonderful  for graduate students. One of my former Ph.D. students is largely  responsible for the recent surge of interest in this idea. But I think  these extra dimensions smell wrong. What we are learning from elementary  particle physics about the unification of all the forces in nature tends to  point in a direction that is not the direction these large parallel  universe models suggest. As beautiful and as sexy as they are, if I had to  bet, I'd bet that these large extradimensional ideas are probably not  right. We'll see.   SA: How did you come to write The Physics of Star Trek?   LK: Actually, it began as a joke, probably sometime in 1993. I had just  finished Fear of Physics for Basic Books. I was chatting with my editor  about what I might do for them next. Somewhere in the conversation, she  mentioned something about her daughter's being a Trekker. "How about The  Physics of Star Trek?" she laughed.  That night I started thinking about the transporter, a Star Trek device  that disassembled your atoms, moved them almost instantaneously to  somewhere else and reassembled them in that place. What might it take to  build one? That led to my making a list of all these neat Star Trek  phenomena that one could use to hook people into thinking about physics. If  people loved this imaginary stuff, I thought, why couldn't they love real  science, which is a thousand times more amazing?  I was blunt about Trek things that wouldn't work. But I also pointed  readers toward more fascinating possibilities in the real universe. Real  science comes up with ideas that no fiction writer would have the temerity  to suggest. Think about cosmic antigravity, something I work on at my day  job: no one understands why empty space should have energy. It's the  weirdest idea in the world!    "I'm not against teaching faith-based ideas in religious classes; I'm just  against teaching them as if they were science."   SA: Why?   LK: If you asked a child how much energy there is in empty space, he'd say  "none," because that's the sensible answer. But what we've learned is  that's not true: if you take everything away, there's still something there.  What's worse is: if you put a little amount of energy into empty space,  then everything we know about the laws of physics says you should be able  to put a tremendous amount of energy into it. Once you open the dam and  allow empty space to have energy, you ask how much it should naturally  have. Our current understanding of gravity and quantum mechanics says that  empty space should have about 120 orders of magnitude more energy than the  amount we measure it to have. That is 1 with 120 zeroes after it! How to  reduce the amount it has by such a huge magnitude, without making it  precisely zero, is a complete mystery. Among physicists, this is considered  the worst fine-tuning problem in physics.  When we solve this problem, we're going to have to explain why the number  that we measure is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would expect it  to be. No one has an idea how to do that. And that's why it's the most  exciting thing in physics. Because weird makes things exciting.   SA: You are one of the few top physicists who is also known as a public  intellectual. In the middle of the past century, that kind of activity by  scientists was much more common. Albert Einstein, in fact, was an  international celebrity, whose private views of everything from nuclear  disarmament to Zionism were solicited by the press. Why do you think you're  such a rare bird that way now?   LK: I can't speak for others. Besides my own research, I see part of my  mission as trying to close the disconnect between science and the rest of  the culture. We live in a society where it's considered okay for  intelligent people to be scientifically illiterate. Now, it wasn't always  that way. At the beginning of the 20th century, you could not be considered  an intellectual unless you could discuss the key scientific issues of the  day. Today you can pick up an important intellectual magazine and find a  write-up of a science book with a reviewer unashamedly saying, "This was  fascinating. I didn't understand it." If they were reviewing a work by John  Kenneth Galbraith, they wouldn't flaunt their ignorance of economics.   SA: How did science illiteracy become socially acceptable?   LK: We all know how badly science is taught in many schools. So many middle  school and even some high school teachers have no background in science.  When my daughter was in the second grade and I went to her school, I was  stunned by how her teacher seemed incredibly uncomfortable with having to  teach even the simplest scientific concepts. I think this is common. And  there is the reality that science has grown increasingly esoteric, making  it more difficult for laypeople to grasp.  The truth is--and I'm hardly the first to say this--after World War II,  American scientists became an isolated elite. The secrets that allowed them  to change the world also allowed them to shirk responsibility for  citizenship. Scientists became a class above society, rather than a part of  it. And so for the longest time, certainly until the 1970s, many American  scientists just didn't believe that reaching the public was important.  Those were good times, with lots of money coming in. The wake-up call came  in 1993, when Congress killed the Superconducting Super Collider. That was  a real signal physicists were doing something wrong.  We hadn't convinced the public--or even all of our colleagues--that it was  worth billions to build this thing. And since then, it has become clear: to  get money for what we do, we're going to have to explain it to the public.  My predilection is to try to connect the interesting ideas in science to  the rest of people's lives.   SA: The big public issue you've been identified with is fighting against  creationist teachings in the schools. For the past couple years, you've  spent your time traveling, debating creationists on proposed curriculum  changes for Ohio's high schools. Was that fun?   LK: It was the least fun of anything I've ever done. Convincing people of  the excitement of science is fun; trying to stave off attacks on science  feels like the most incredible waste of time, even if necessary. I got  drafted after several creationists were appointed to the Standards  Committee of the Ohio State Board of Education. They were proposing new  standards to create false controversy around evolution by introducing an ad  hoc idea called intelligent design into high school science classes.  For nearly a year, I found myself in the middle of what was almost the  equivalent of a political campaign. When it was over, we won and we lost.  We won because we had kept intelligent design out of science classes. We  lost because in the spirit of "fairness," the board added a sentence to the  standards saying, "Students should learn how scientists are continuing to  critically examine evolutionary theory." I strongly opposed this. I wanted  them to say that scientists are continuing to critically examine everything.  As I feared, this sentence opened the door for the creationists' claiming  that there is controversy about the accuracy of evolutionary theory. And  it's come back to haunt us. Just the other week, I had to put everything I  was doing aside because the creationists were back at their old games again  in Ohio. One of the model lessons that came out was an intelligent-design  diatribe. Basically, they snuck the whole thing in again, through the back  door. This becomes so tiresome that you just want to say, "Forget about it,  go on." But then you realize that this is exactly what Phillip Johnson,  this lawyer who first proposed the intelligent-design strategy, proposed  when he said something like, "We'll just keep going and going and going  till we outlast the evolutionists."   SA: Do scientists trap themselves when they try to be "fair" and "give  equal time" in their debates with the anti-Darwinists?   LK: Yes. Because science isn't fair. It's testable. In science, we prove  things by empirical methods, and we toss out things that have been  disproved as wrong. Period. This is how we make progress.  I'm not against teaching faith-based ideas in religion classes; I'm just  against teaching them as if they were science. And it disturbs me when  someone like Bill Gates, whose philanthropy I otherwise admire, helps  finance one of the major promoters of intelligent design by giving money to  a largely conservative think tank called the Discovery Institute. Yes, they  got a recent grant from the Gates Foundation. It's true that the almost  $10-million grant, which is the second they received from Gates, doesn't  support intelligent design, but it does add credibility to a group whose  goals and activities are, based on my experiences with them, intellectually  suspect. During the science standards debate in Ohio, institute operatives  constantly tried to suggest that there was controversy about evolution  where there wasn't and framed the debate in terms of a fairness issue,  which it isn't. [Editors' note: Amy Low, a media relations officer  representing the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, says that the  foundation "has decided not to respond to Dr. Krauss's comments."]   SA: Why do you find this grant so particularly disturbing that you single  it out here?   LK: Because we're living in a time when so many scientific questions are  transformed into public relations campaigns--with truth going out the  window in favor of sound bites and manufactured controversies. This is  dangerous to science and society, because what we learn from observation  and testing can't be subject to negotiation or spin, as so much in politics is.  The creationists cut at the very credibility of science when they cast  doubt on our methods. When they do that, they make it easier to distort  scientific findings in controversial policy areas.  We can see that happening right now with issues like stem cells, abortion,  global warming and missile defense. When the testing of the proposed  missile defense system showed it didn't work, the Pentagon's answer, more  or less, went, "No more tests before we build it."   SA: Between your popular writing and your political work, when do you do  science?   LK: In the quiet hours of the night, in between those things. I do it  then--or when I have the opportunity to sit down with students and  postdocs. It's amazing to me, when we do that, how much we can accomplish.  I rely on that a lot lately.  There can be months when I'm working on other things, and I get very, very  depressed. Talking about science is important, and it may be the most  important thing that I do. But if I'm not actually doing science, I feel  like a fraud. On the other hand, if I don't do the public stuff, I also  feel like a fraud.   SA: Why a fraud?   LK: Because science is not done in a vacuum. It is done in a social  context, and the results of science have important implications for  society, even if it is simply providing a general understanding of how we  humans fit into the cosmos.  Thus, simply producing new knowledge, without making any attempt to help  disseminate it and explain it, is not enough. I think one cannot expect  every scientist to spend time on the effort to explain science. But in a  society in which the science is of vital importance and also in which many  forces are trying to distort the results of science, it is crucial that  some of us speak out.

      Tonight, Michael Moore begins the liberal onslaught against the Bush Administration with high hopes of humiliating him out of office. I can't wait. More than anything, to be honest, I'm ready for some hot and heavy controversy.  I think it's been a tragedy that most of my generation is disengaged from politics, apathetic and uninspired.  So many of my peers are unwilling to discuss controversial matters because it makes them uncomfortable... .    ?  Dude, discomfort is a small price to pay for active debate that leads to creative thinking, higher understanding, and vast potential change.  We need WAY more controversy.  We need arguments and accountability and challenging perspectives, and we need more than that- we need to speak with our feet.  I just can't believe that after the president stated, in his State of the Union Address, that he was considering changing the constitution to ensure that marriage was protected as a heterosexual sanction that thousands of us didn't flood the streets!! I wanted to. I wanted to when we pre-emptively went to war, not to mention when a president was put into office that wasn't truly elected. I have to go (my science awaits me) but I'm psyched for Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11- FYI check out www.michaelmoore.com

      Amidst all the organizing and science, friends and politics, I often find myself wondering what kind of alternative career I'd choose if things had happened differently.  Realistically, all us scientists sit around the break room discussing how nice it'd be to run off and open a hotdog stand on the beach (with a striped umbrella and a cooler of beverages nearby).  And while I'm sure we'd come up with some rationalization as to why pipetting skills well prepared us for the kielbasa sales market, it isn't the clearest next step on the career ladder for most Yale PhD's. But why is it that we slave away every day in lab fantasizing about doing something completely different? Is it just typical work burnout or is it the nature of the current science job market? Do humanities PhD's and other workers share similar visions? I expect some comments.  I recently confessed to Shannon that I want to direct a movie. Never mind that I haven't ever held a camcorder, I'm a fast learner :)   I took this awesome Sex & Gender on Film class at Haverford my senior year and I've never sat back and enjoyed a movie the same way since.  First of all, I was introduced to some classic directors/directing styles and to icons like Marilyn Monroe. (Who's ever the same after Marilyn, really? gentleman prefer blondes- rent it, buy it, never leave home without it).  Secondly, movies are an amazing way to provide social commentary (and criticism).  And all the little things in a movie make a world of difference- the lighting, the angle, the sound- I can't believe how much thought goes into it. A new favorite of mine is M. Night Shyamalan: Signs, Sixth Sense, Invincible, and the Village (which comes out tomorrow).  But of course, I also enjoy mindless romantic comedies that no one else seems to like. In fact, I think I own every sandra bullock movie... which I'm pretty sure nobody liked. I'm bet none of them were given an oscar either... or... were ever NOMINATED for an oscar. Hmm... Well, I'm too busy with my orgnaizing and sciencing to put anything together (and I'm too broke to afford a digital camcorder) but keep your eyes peeled for my name in lights someday.  anyone who has ideas for a screenplay or wants to apply for a starring role, let me know.  We could make our debut together :)

      I am in LOVE with Barack Obama. I got to see him speak at the UNITE-HERE! convention in Chicago (where our hotel and restaurant union merged with a textile/laundy/garment union).  While so many other people spoke in the abstract about how we need to make workers get treated well and union density and get Kerry in and Bush out, Barack really spoke from concrete examples of living in Chicago- from hardships and opportunities of his own life.  He was smart, enthusiastic, dynamic, articulate, and fiery.  He stands on the right side of all the issues as I can tell, and we need to get him in the White House (in about 8 years).   Last night he spoke at the DNC for John Kerry and was, again as expected, totally amazing.  Here's a quote:  "In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here — the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope!  In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead. I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America!"  I believe we can have a better tomorrow with jobs and a real middle class and universal healthcare and retirement with dignity- but I believe we have to fight like hell for it.  I don't think people understand the power that the people at the top have. President Bush. President Levin. These men have an agenda and millions and millions to back it.  They are counting on people to be complacent, apathetic, scared- or working too hard in vulnerable jobs to fight back.  That's why these issues that seem so small are SO important: daycare, healthcare, pensions, overtime, a decent minimum wage, security, paid leave, intellectual property.  These things allow us to have time and care for our kids, our careers, our studies, our unions and other political organizations that ensure democracy is working.

      I have pink eye. Ewwwwwwwwww. Not only is it annoying to be stumbling around in old glasses without the correct perscription, but it's embaressing.  Who picked these frames? me!? I wish I could even say they were fashionable 5 years ago, but I don't imagine these babies were ever in style.  I need an image consultant... maybe I'll call one of the ladies from Comp Lit- the people in the languages are so fabulous!  not that I could afford new glasses, they cost like 500 bucks!  Hello vision plan, paging a vision plan...   maybe I should get a patch and walk around like a pirate. did anyone see kill bill vol2? that part gave me the eebie jeebies.

      This past weekend was the Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions (CGEU) conference -- although I kinda wanted to get a CGEU button just so I could make up false realities for the acronym. Crazy Geriatric Elitists Unite or Caged Gorrilla Emancipation Underground... I was once kissed by a man in a gorilla costume while waiting for my mom to pick me up from the library. That's a story for another day.  The conference was really great- two days in NYC with 120 other liberal, young, enthusiastic and dynamic intellectuals struggling to find a way to take back the academy from corporate america's reigns.  Speakers from our international unions encouraged us to focus all our energy on getting Bush out of office in november (amen!) and to work together. organize together. STRIKE together. Every campus's fight is a the same fight, and we need each other. On the last day, after tiring but interesting workshops on things like building committee, increasing diversity, and creating a corporate campaign, we formed caucuses to plan our future together on such initiatives. The private schools had a caucus, and since Yale had about a bazillion people going to that, a few of us decided to have one for those who organize scientists. People came from Yale, UMich, SUNY, Ohio State, Temple, UC, Cornell, and Rutgers.  I won't go into details now, but Hallelujah, radical scientists rock.  And while I'm still waiting for more details on the private school caucus, I think we organized them to be on our program which will mean kicking the crap out of our campuses this spring. So... the conference was a success. And just to throw a cherry on top, I met a really cute guy from Cal State. A scientist no less. Yowza :)

      While New Haven quiets down a bit in these months, the medical school barely changes.  My mice apparently don't vacation.  I enjoy the ease with which to find downtown parking, the shorter waits at restaurants, and the lack of fake-ids at the bars... if ever I get to do such things :)  Lab and organizing are keeping me incredibly busy, and I'm worried that my super-human all-nighter powers are beginning to fade. Several attempts lately to stay in lab overnight have resulted in my waking up in the conference room the next morning rather than after an hour incubation.  Also, Kate is getting me to the track at 7 a few days a week. While I used to be able to complete an hour workout and get to work an hour later, now I come home and go back to bed for an hour before showering and coming into lab.  Is 24 old?  The one thing that's totally throwing my schedule off kilter is the weekends- saturdays and sundays have often been some of my most productive days, as there's no organizing, no good TV, and no one in lab to distract me from my work. But this summer I've had week after week of events... the HERE-UNITE convention, Jack, my parents, NYC for the CGEU.  All of these evnets have been wonderful and aren't worth trading in for a million dollars (or a few thousand in mice), but it's still leaving me exhausted.  I think this next month I'm going to have to have Leah hide my keys and credit cards so I stay in town and don't buy any airfare... or shoes.  Alright, my iced coffee is melting. Oh and my elisa needs to be washed.  And I have to call the car insurance guy!  Crap!  The to-do list never seems to get any shorter :)

      Poor, poor eva. She should have never gotten out of bed today.  Just yesterday she became entangled in AAA hell with her faulty volkswagon that left her stranded at the shops of Hamden.  And then today, our little eva made the tragic decision to come to work.  Poor, poor eva.    I don't know all the details, but I do know that before noon Eva faced not one but TWO brushes with death.  Before NOON. That's a heck of a morning at the medschool, let me tell ya. I mean, we do work with consistently with powerful microorganisms and mutagens and toxic chemicals, but at least we know what's in front of us... most of the time. there was this time when I spilt this powdery AEC stuff all over both Rachael's and my toes (yes, we were wearing flip flops in lab, call OSHA already) and all we could make out on the cracked glass bottle that shattered by our feet was a skull and crossbones. That was an interesting day.  I'm still waiting for my eleventh toe to grow.  Anyway, where was I? EVA. Two brushes with death. Right.  So Eva decides to go crazy and risk riding the medical school elevators.  You'd think you could trust these things but don't be decieved by the shiny silver interior and pretty chimes, it's all for show.  In Eva's case, they did manage to get her somewhere... right about to floor 1 and a half of BCMM.  Can you imagine? what I would've given to see the look on eva's face when that elevator just decided to go ahead and stop before it got to the second floor- that squinty dark italian look and the "you've got to be kidding" head shake that you'd think would scare anything into submission.  The elevator, mysteriously impervious to the Campodonico stare-down, wouldn't budge and anything that's not afraid of Eva is worth avoiding for life. I'm taking the stairs from now on, baby!  She actually had to use that little emergency phone that you've always wanted to try, although I'm sure the circumstances of the situation robbed the moment of it's glory.  All of a sudden (sudden being after a painful 25 minutes alone in a stuffy all too casketlike box) our little eva was pulled, dangling by her wrists, flailing her feet out of a little window of space at the top of the elvator and being dragged face-first onto the second floor. Ohhh.... oh the image.   And then (yes, there's more) then when she finally had her freedom she chose not to go home but to press on to the stockroom (despite the fact that her stockroom cart was still between the first and second floor) where after and hour of trying to carry the lab's new  inventory tucked under arm and chin,  she was forced to evacuate the stockroom as it became filled with acrid smoke.  Acrid smoke!   Can you believe this story??! Who didn't send eva the sour milk in the last cup of cereal, black cat, bad horoscope, out of toothpaste DON'T YOU DARE STEP OUT THE FRONT DOOR memo?!?! She deserved a warning of some kind, I mean... REALLY!   Sigh :)  Alright, well I guess I should get back to work, I hope everyone enjoyed story time and learned a valuable lesson.  I think I'm going to put a spare nutrigrain bar in my bag as a ration in case of disaster. You just never know what's gonna happen.

      Scientific American has done a long, interesting interview with Lawrence Krauss (a little blurb below).   This guy studies dark matter and was willing to sign a petition against all the conflict of interest and profit-driven research that plagues our current tax-payer funded research.  We love him.   urlLink the entire article   the blurb:  Lawrence M. Krauss speaks about unfinished business   Chair of the physics department at Case Western Reserve University,  Lawrence M. Krauss is famed in the research community for his prescient  suggestion that a still mysterious entity called dark energy might be the  key to understanding the beginnings of the universe. He is also an  outspoken social critic and in February was among 60 prominent scientists  who signed a letter entitled "Restoring Scientific Integrity in  Policymaking," complaining of the Bush administration's misuse of scienc

      Out of all the  urlLink late-night jokes on bush , Craig Kilborn (and a skilled team of joke-cranking midgets) had me the closest to peeing:  "Campaigning in Iowa yesterday President Bush vowed he will not raise taxes in the next four years. He said I believe it is hard, very difficult to raise taxes when you are not president."   "With Iraq plunging into chaos and gas prices at record highs President Bush took time out this weekend for a ride on his bicycle, but unfortunately he fell off and sustained cuts to his face and hands. Apparently Bush was distracted by the enormous responsibilities of the presidency. I'm just kidding. He hit some gravel or something."   "President Bush says in the last month he has created 300,000 new jobs. Yeah, they're called Kerry campaign workers."   "President Bush announced a billion dollar mission to the moon and Mars. He came up with a snappy new slogan — to drill where no man has drilled before."  "As the Democrats get revved up at their convention in Boston, President Bush is fighting back the only way he knows how: by going on vacation! Ah, it's nice to take a rest, replenish your supply of smirks. The vacation was expected, because Bush traditionally takes a month off every summer to relax and avoid reading National Security Warnings."

      MIchael Booth is moving to Alaska. Yes, Alaska. This is a huge loss for the continental 48...  Boothy is one of my favoritist people ever. EVER. He is so interesting that I couldn't even begin to list all of his interests and hobbies and travels and talents- he is the most renaisance individual and he does it all without wearing underwear. Ahhhh Michael Booth.  Having a really good friend that you haven't spoken to in months come to tell you he's going to Alaska has really made me stop and think... is there anything IN alaska?  Apparently there are MEN in Alaska. This isn't why Michael Booth is going, of course, but I hear that the ratio of men to women is quite stacked.  Booth says they are all the rugged independant types that have built their own houses and started their own companies and have several academic degrees and are subsequently totally weird and bad at conversation.   Shannon and I decided it was still worth a visit.  The really interesting part about talking to Michael Booth (he is SO delightful) is trying to figure out what we're going to do with our lives. We're both scientists. We're both passionate about changing the world for the better. We both are leaning towards the conclusion that there is no way to stay being the first and make progress toward the latter. So what do we do? Politics? organizing? Education reform? Non-profit work?  I'm not sure. I'm not sure Booth will find any answers in the great white tundra, but I'm not sure I'm finding anything in the great white new england either.   At some point I'll have to figure it out. It'd be nice to figure it out somewhere warmer :)  I'm pretty sure that no matter what it is we do, the biggest change will come from organzing some kind of grassroots change.  But do I organize postdoc unions to fight for better science careers or do I organize poor african americans to fight for equal opportunity and employment in cities? Do I fight to get Barack in office? Do I fight to keep Bushes out? I'm not sure, although playing defensive is what has eroded the democratic party.  I guess the only thing I can do right now is be happy there are Michael Booth's. And Shannon's. And Mary Catherine's. And Rachael's. And Wendi's. Although with Booth going to Alaska, MC going to Cali, Wendi going to Florida, I'm gonna have to get my ass in gear to make some more revoluntionary allies :)
