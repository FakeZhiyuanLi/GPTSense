      Todae,woke up as early as 10 am..I quickly get change and went straight from Yishun Mrt to Jurong Mrt to take some items from my fren.Well somethin happened when i was taking mrt..Something GREAT did happened for me :) ..I was sitting at the mrt listening to my Ipod when i noticed this cute girl standing at the mrt.She just got on the train at Choa Chu Kang Mrt..I did look at her once..ermm not once but twice..ermm actually it thrice..Thinking of getting to knoe her but i was a bit nervous..Well in my heart i really hope that she got down at Jurong East Mrt..Well i was wrong,she did get down but not at Jurong East..She drop down at Bukit Batok if iam not wrong..I was thinking ,if i don ask her for her number,i will not know if she will accept me or reject me as her fren..I don want to sae WAT IF WAT IF I ASK for her number..Soo before the mrt door close down,I quickly dash out and walk as quickly as possible..I walk towards her and quickly ask for her number..She smile and she gave me her number..Well that was not the end..Soon after taking items from my fren,i went to Somerset to check out if there is any Job Vacancy at Hmv..Well all they ask me is to call this someone by the name of Lisa..I was ask by Lisa to email my Resume to the hmv department..Well it was like a waste of my time going to Hmv and ended up getting to email the job application at my home..Soo as usual but this time iam alone,walk toward Cuppage and check out if there is anybody i knew out there at the pool table..It was sad that none of them i knew was there..But i did make some new fren out there..I was introduced by the owner of the pool table by a guy name Alex..I did play some pool of games wit Alex and i must admit This damn Alex is damn gd at playing pool..He did thrash me hard in that game..It was soo fun hanging out wit him even though we just knew each other..Out of a sudden Huda (the gal which i knew at mrt)sms me asking me to meet her..She was concidently at Bugis..Soo after a game of pool,i meet her at City Hall Mrt..i was kinda shy at first but as time pass,i started getting ok wit her..We decided to have a walk at Northpoint and we ate some Mee Siam n drank Ice lemon tea..I wonder why she like that taugee(some kind of vegetable that i hate most)and i knew that she sae that it is a javanese kind of cook i gueess..She look kinda tired n stress soo i send her back home..I was happy going out wit her..Soo Finally todae is a gd day for me!And 1 more thing she is GEmini and soo do I! :) tata thats all for todae!

      I am very sad tonight.I sms my Godmum at 9.50pm telling her that this friday is my birthday..I waited for her reply anxiously..At 10.02 pm,i received an sms and discovered that she has reply to my sms.I was soo happy and can;t wait to see her message..To discover that she say she was on a tour wit her family till sunday is a great blow to me..I don knoe if i can be happy on friday without her presence..I just hope i can see her again..
