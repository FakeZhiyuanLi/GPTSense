          Lost And Lonely        By: Jonathan Rickey                          “    What happened to us We used to be so perfect, now we're lost and lonely What happened to us And deep inside I wonder, did I lose my only?”                             The boy shuts off his CD player and then realizes that he is lost and lonely like the lyrics said. He continues to walk home from a friend’s house. Once he got home he jumped on the couch and fell asleep. While he was asleep he dreamed. He dreamed of a lonely future and he didn’t know why. The next morning he woke up and went to his computer and started talking on AOL IM and he told his friend and she said you won’t be lonely. You can think that but ur never lonely. Ur loved ones always are thinking of u. Even ppl that u never really knew but u met in a soccer game are even thinking of you. It may be in the farthest corner of their mind but a little part of them are always thinking of you. He told his friend thankx and got off the internet but never forgot what his friend said. He left his house and went for a walk to a place where all it was peace and quiet and he could think. He sat there and thought and then remembered that no one lives forever. He started crying b/c he thought he was lonely and no one cared. But little did he know ppl care they just express it in ways he doesn’t realize. He finally decided to leave and halfway home he saw a house fire. Outside of the house he saw a lady and she was yelling save my son.    He then made the 2 sec decision and thought to himself and told himself he has nothing to live for and nothing to lose. He ran into the burning house and as the flames engulfed the house he continued to fight his way through to the kid. He finally found the kid trapped under some wood from the ceiling. He couldn’t lift the wood so he kept trying to lift the wood then he tried pushing it. After a while pushing the wood the kid escaped but he couldn’t. He was too tired…he passed out and then the next thing he saw was a guy in a yellow coat and a mask on and carrying him out. He was saved by a fireman then he was sent to the hospital for 3 rd  degree burns. He awoke to ppl sitting around him and cards and flowers around him. He looked forward and saw his family and friends. Then he went back to sleep and in his dream he did not dream of a lonely life but a fun life with a nice house, wife, kids, and the perfect place to live. He woke up 10 hours later and was covered in a cast for his burns. He had been burned on his legs and his arms but they would go away eventually. But no longer was his life lonely. No longer was he lost. No longer was he sad. Now he was happy and had friends that he realized they truly care for him. On his last day in the hospital the mother of the child he rescued offered him a reward… a cash reward. He wouldn’t take it.. and told the woman he had already gotten enough. But he didn’t tell her what he got…. He got a clear view of a good life instead of a foggy view where in only from time to time would he be happy. Now this boy has no worries b/c he now knows that everyone cares for everyone.             THE            END

          By: Jonathan Rickey        Heaven And Earth                         <>  Walking down the street looking at ur feet thinking u are the ugliest person, But then u realize that u have friends that may not like u but will be there for u          No matter what happens and then the worst thing happens    You look up from ur feet and look down the street and see a fight    Soon one of the ppl pulls out a gun and fires in ur direction but is aiming at the guy he is fighting, the bullet is coming and u have less than a split second to think but u can’t think fast enough and RIPPPPP it rips through ur skin and clothes. It happened so fast it takes about 10 secs for u to catch up with what happened and then u feel the pain of the shot. There is ppl standing around you and everyone is looking at you and asking are you alright, but u see right past them and see a light and see a man with his arms wide open and reaches for ur hand and pulls you up.          Then u look behind you and see ur body and the shot wound and then u look up and see Jesus and he talks to you and reassures u that u are not ugly and that some ppl may act like they hate u but deep down no one hates anyone…. everyone deep down likes someone even if they say they hate them they truly deep down like them and then Jesus lets u down nice and soft back to ur body and u wake up and u are in an Ambulance. Next thing u see are 2 doctors standing over you talking. Then there is a gas that makes u all of a sudden makes you fall asleep. Then you don’t wake up to someone that cares you wake up to your lord and savior Jesus. He tells you that you have gone to heaven. You then out of nowhere see the one person that was nice to you and never got mad no matter what and always had a smile on her face. But u never told her how u felt and she was always there for u a shoulder to cry on, a person to lean on, and a little boost of confidence. Once you see her you follow her while ur in heaven and protect her from anything that may happen to her. But then one day something happens that you can’t stop and u realize that her life was better if you were never to have been in it and that everyone was happier that you weren’t alive. The next thing you see is her in heaven with you and you take the chance and tell her how you feel and she tells you how she feels and then you live forever with her, the person of your dreams, your secret love in heaven. As the time goes on you start to see more of your friends and the ppl that said they didn’t like you were now your friends. B/c in heaven everyone is nice and no one is ever mad. There are no more wars, fights, arguments, and lives of friends or family members taken by wars. Some ppl may think that life in heaven is not different than life on earth, but in the end they are wrong. Heaven is like the place everyone dreams about, the place everyone wants live in, and the perfect place. Heaven has no poverty, no hatred, no    guns, and most of all has nothing to worry about. No one is poor, no one is rich, no one is mean, no one is mad, no one is homeless, no one is better than anyone else, no misses anyone, no one is lonely, and most of all it has no worries.           THE            END
