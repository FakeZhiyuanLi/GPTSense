      At PokerStars.com they have nine &amp; 18 people sit and go tournaments. They vary in costs from $5 to $5000 (no kidding) and usually last between 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Basically, you pay the entry fee, get 1500 in chips, and play until there is a winner. Placing in 2nd and 3rd will make you money in the nine player game. The 18 player game pays out to four winners. I decided to play the better odds and play only at the nine player tables. At the nine player table I have at least a 33% chance of winning, as opposed to the 22% chance at the 18 player table. Of course, the 18 player table has bigger payouts. Over the weekend I played in four of them. Here's a breakdown of each one:  1) I spent the better part of the entire game folding. I folded so much, I suddenly found myself in fourth place with only about 150 in chips, which at that point was lower than the big blind. When the blind came to me, I was put all in and dealt a K/Q suited. I flopped two pair and won the hand. I eventually won another hand to put my chip count back over a 1,000 and outlasted one other guy to put myself in third place. Four hands later I had about 2,000 in chips and the chip leader had been suddenly bounced from the table, pitting me with 2,000 chips against the only guy left, with 11,000 chips. Needless to say, a few hands later, I was out. However, due to my patience, I won $13.50. I'd like to take a moment to pat myself on the back.  2) Much the same as the first one, but this time I got bumped out in third place and won $9.00. I actually don't remember much of this one at all other than finishing in third.  3) Got put out rather quickly and finished in eighth place. I went all-in with three of a kind (10's) and a King kicker. Some asshole had the Ace kicker. Oh well.  4) After my disappointing showing in the big tournament (see previous post), I figured I'd give a sit and go one more try before I went to bed. Guess what? I got decent cards, playable flops, made some good calls, and ended up winning the match in less than an hour. That win was good for $22.00. Even better was that I took out this guy who habitually pre-flop raised to try and bully pots and other players, gleefully showing his 3/6 unsuited when everyone folded. Karma bit him in the ass later in the game, when heads up against me, I was dealt an A/A, K/K, an A/K suited on three out of five hands to take him out. He wouldn't even reciprocate the "good game" I gave him in the chat bar after I took his chips, rather going with the always popular "f*** you."  All told, I spent $22 to join the tables and won $43.50. Can't complain about that.

      Well, for starters, let's just say I didn't fare to well in the final standings. Of 2200 or so participants, I finished in 873rd place, miles out of the money.  The good news was that I actually saw quite a few decent starting hands. The bad news was that I saw quite a few useless flops. For example, my last hand I was dealt an A/Q suited and was beat by a pair of three's. True story.  And since I got dealt several quality hands like the one above, I spent quite a few chips pre-flop raising to bump people out. Of course, it didn't matter as I ended up folding after the flop or turn, 200-300 chips lighter than before.  Oh well, it was only three bucks.

      Last night I entered into a $5 per person poker tournament at PokerStars.com; which is a pretty good place to play poker online. I have had no complaints with their service thus far. Anyway, when registration came to a close, there were 1640 players, with a first place prize of $1,886.00. The top 135 people were to come away with prize money.  I spent much of the first 30-35 minutes of the tournament folding. After my first 35 hands, I had seen the flop only twice. Nothing good was coming my way. I wasn't disheartened though, in that time period I only lost about 130 in chips from my original 1500 and over 300 people had already busted out. Then it happened. I was dealt an A/3 suited while the big blind with three calls but no raises. I checked and the flop came out A/A/3, giving me a full house. I bet 500 into the pot, hoping someone would have the other Ace and raise. Sure enough, someone did, he raised another 500, I re-raised all-in and he called. We showed our cards and he was sitting on an A/2 unsuited and pretty much out of the pot unless a pair dropped on the turn and river, which didn't. I didn't knock him out, but I raised my chip count from 1300 to 3700. I immediately got hot and won a few more hands to drive my chip count up to 5,300 just before the first break.  After the break I was still in control of the table and pushed my chip count up to 8100. At that point, I had the big stack at the table and was in the top 50 in total chips. Then, about 20 minutes in, they closed our table and moved me to a different one. This wouldn't have been so bad except that I was now the short stack at the table. WTF!? I was literally sitting at a table with two players who had 20,000 in chips and two more who had over 15,000 in chips.  Despite being suddenly disadvantaged, I stuck to my game plan and played tight. I won a couple of smaller pots and got my chip count up to 9670 with about 20 minutes to go before the second break. However, that would be my peak. I was moved once again to another table just after that and my fortunes went down hill. By the time the second break came around, I was down to about 3100 in chips. The good news though is that I was one of only 341 people left. The bad news is that the blinds were 300 small and 600 big plus a 25 chip ante. If I didn't win some hands soon, I was going to be blinded off the table.  I played tighter than ever, but I just wasn't getting playable cards. Had I even got something like an A/10 suited I would have tried to bluff and bully the blinds for the pot before the flop. I did get a few K/3 and Q/5 suited, but I wasn't confident in playing them. During this time, my chip count had faded to 1,250 and I was in serious danger of being blinded off the table. When dealt and Q/9 suited as the big blind with no raisers, I checked and flopped a nine. With my pot now down to 625, I went all in. The other player had a pair of jacks and the game looked over for me. However, I caught some luck and sucked out the Queen on the river. With the win, I got my pot back up to 3400. However, another win was not in store, and I was out about 20 minutes later thanks to the blinds and two flops that did nothing for me (each one cost 600 to see).  I ended the tournament in 157th place, 22 spots out of the money.  The Good: On the whole I think I played better in this tournament than the last and I finished over 150 spots higher.  The Bad: Finishing only 22 spots out of the money really stung. Plus, I lost over 3500 chips in a hand to a guy who got the card he needed on the river to win the pot.  The Ugly: I lost 2300 in chips because I got bullied by a player with half of the chips I had. This was only two hands after the 3500 chip loss. I was dealt a K/J unsuited and called the big blind, players across the table folded to the small blind, who raised the bet a 1000. The big blind folded, and I raised to 2000. He re-raised all in, which would have cost me about another 3000 in chips (and would have left me with close to 2900). Instead of calling, I folded. After giving it much thought, I should have called. Unless he had a pocket pair and flopped a third, his odds of winning the pot couldn't have been that much better than mine. I basically gave away 2000 in chips.

      A hand with two pair has got to be the most frustrating hand to hold in a game of poker. On the strength list, it's close to the bottom, just above a single pair or a high card. However, it's a hand that has a good chance of winning if played the right way. Here are two things I've learned the hard way:  1) If you are given two cards, say A/7 unsuited and the flop comes out A/7/4, bet heavy. You have two pair, with the higher one being an Ace, which would beat all other two pair combos. You want to take the pot with as little fuss as possible because if the river and turn cards come out, the odds that someone still in the hand landing something goes up. With only three cards on the table, the odds of a player having a flush are low to none if they are unsuited. A straight is possible if the cards are close together, say 9/6/10. But if they are spread out, say 2/7/J, a straight is doubtful. The one hand to be truly careful of would be three of a kind. For instance, someone could have pocket 4's and hit the third one on the flop, which would beat your two pair. However, a three of kind with 4's can be spooked out by a high bet if you front that you may have pocket Aces or 7's.  2) If you are given the same A/7 and the flop comes out 7/Q/Q, bet cautiously. It's pretty safe to assume that someone at the table (depending on size) was dealt a Queen. This would be a good time to check/raise. Check (if you have the option) and see how your opponents bet. If they check or simply bet a low amount, this might be your best shot at the pot. If someone goes heavy, they could have the Queen, and it might not be a good idea to stick around. This is a total go-with-your gut call depending on your knowledge of the other player.  As a rule (for me anyway), don't put much faith in a board pair to help you win a hand with two pair. I'm not saying it can't be done, it's just that the odds start to stack up against you. You have to always remember that although it may look nice, and the guys on TV win with two pair often enough, its a low-ranked hand. I am not a poker expert though, just a guy talking from experience, so don't blame me if you get hosed.

      Since some of you may have no idea what I'm talking about terminology wise, here is a list of the most commonly known poker terms:  urlLink http://conjelco.com/pokglossary.html . Maybe this well help you make sense of some of my first and future posts. I'll add it as a link on the right side of the page.

      There's no way to know how good you are at something until you dive right in and try it. I've been dabbling with poker, mostly no-limit Texas Hold'em, for the last few months. It's something I've always wanted to play and it's very easy to learn.  Last night, I entered into my first real poker tournament. It was hosted by PokerStars.com and had a field of over 2,000 people. The cost was a minimal $2 and the top prize was over $1,200. I honestly didn't think I would end up in first, but maybe I would place in money. That meant I would have to place at least in position 135.  The first hour rolls by and I'm in the thick of things, with the 456th best chip stack out of the 1100 or so players still in it. I played tight, took down a few good pots, and took out a few players. That's the name of the game.  The second hour came to a close and I was ranked 206 out of 413 contestants. Not bad for my first tournament. I'm not quite in the money, but I've got a good chance.  Twenty minutes later the whole thing comes crashing down. At this point, I'm in the top 150, sitting on just over 5,000 in chips (every player started with 1,500) when this player with a short stack (about 1,200 in chips) goes all-in before the flop. This is quite a gamble as he has not seen the flop and has no idea what cards could come up. Everyone folds except me and another player. The flop comes and there is a King on the board, which just so happens to match the two I was dealt. I figure I'm in excellent shape to win this hand. I bet another 1,500 hoping the other player will follow me in. He does and I can just smell the pot now.  The turn card is a diamond, putting three diamonds on the board. The other player bets a weak 300 and I raise to 1,000. He re-raises to put me all in. Normally, I would back down from this call. However, I was fairly certain that his hand was not better than mine. There were no face cards on the table other than the king, no straight possibility, and a doubtful flush.  We turn over our cards and I was right. The guy who went all in prior to the flop only had a pair of nines, I had three kings, and the other player had an Queen/Seven unsuited. He did however have a diamond, giving him four, which gave him a slim opportunity to suck out the flush. Well, this post isn't called the first bad beat for nothing. Sure enough, another diamond fell on the river, giving him the pot and knocking me out of the tournament.  Let's just say my computer desk took quite a fist pounding. I had the best hand all the way to the end and got screwed by a hand that shouldn't have even played past the flop. I ended up in 310th place and out of the money. On the whole, I can't complain, I did outlast over 1,700 other players. And, unless an expert comes in and tells me otherwise, I would play that hand the same way again. I think...

       Like it says at the top of the screen, my goal is to win a poker championship within one year of today's date: August 16, 2004. I decided to create a blog dedicated to this so I can share my successes and horror stories. I like to think I'm pretty good at poker, so I'm going to find out.  Of course, in order to document my progress properly, I'm going to have to figure this blogging thing out. Right now, I'm totally confused as to how I'm supposed to upload photos. I'll figure it out though.  I'll periodically update you with my growth as well as direct you to some other interesting poker stories.
