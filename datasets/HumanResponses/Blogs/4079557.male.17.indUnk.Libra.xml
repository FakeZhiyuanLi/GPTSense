       [tears fall down into the pit that was once my heart dark skies, filled bright with stars become my grave my mind reaps a harvest, as it pulls this affection apart and I still will not be taken by what I thought were passion flames]  I can't find a reason to start off this year My clothes are on the floor as I am still in my bed never retiring it's all that I can hear the fading memory of her, remains in my head  you took in me a shelter, from the severe outsides feelings I have, a straightjacket, are beared I'm still not sure if it was yours or if it was mine but this insanity is quickly to be shared  the frostbite of my heart more than my toes This spread-forth eternity is nothing like today until the next life time comes and quickly goes freezing and numb, on this bed I could forever lay  I drop a thousand pennies into this water this hope, in the fountain called tommorrow I'm afraid I'm out of coins, it was only her when she's gone there are none left to be borrowed  and that dark red beating of the bullets of my love strikes deep into my far-from-dreaming head and the peace that once was, flew away like a dove and the romance that we shared, is now dead   I could ramble on like this, for another stanza or two you might discover then that it has no meaning I hear it all the time, "a good poet, are you" but in this, truthfully, there is nothing of me

       You may or may not have noticed the time my latet post was published. While it says 2:44, it doesn't mention the part where I spent the following hour editing it.  4am is late, or early. I was up the morning before, as well and according to what I've observed, Josh's bladder can only make it until 4:00. This is an excellent example of something I don't mind others reading. Now Josh on the other hand...  And so, in attempt to have a more decent sleep schedule, I am writing now, in the early afternoon when I am supposed to be awake. Yet, my mind seems to be blank.     Well, what am I thinking about?   The movie this afternoon should be fun. As many know, I really usually don't like movies, but this one, although it has the potential to be cheesy (or not) I trust will hold my attention quite well. Infact, horror, thriller, mystery, or otherwise dark movies, certainly are not the type of movie I would assume of myself to like, and yet for some reason or another, I really do. Atmospheric, a work of art. To me, it's like listening to good metal.     Darn it, another pointless paragraph. What else is up there?         [This was originally edited out, but now restored:] I'm thinking about a couple of friends, each of which I will spend a part of my day with. The confusing thing is, I am much more inclined to spend time with one, when it should be the other. Details without attraction, I suppose.        Maybe if I take another stab...     It’s last fall, and I’m walking along a broken rode, oh wait- that was my heart. Nevermind, the road was just cold and lonely. My headphones pour from my heart into my ears, “Will aspirins and alcohol someway decrease the ache?” I watch my feet, with nothing in this wretched world but my backpack and CD player. She left me, and there’s nothing in this world for me, anymore. I walk further. Just keep walking, just keep walking. Another beat, another song, another album, it drones into my heart. The agony, the backstabbing, and despite all the pain she’s caused, she’s still all that I want.  Hm...  Darn heartbreak. I can never quite master it. Maybe tomorrow night I’ll pull out my CD player, tight jeans and depressio attitude and try again, in another night of role playing.  When I was a kid no matter how hard I imagined, I could never be a genuine ninja, although I tried again and again. Now let’s see if this imagination can bring me some fun heartbrokeness. It's like the artist's (or at least ex-punk kid's) version of RPG's. As Barney says, “Just imagine!”

           Justice   I will only do it thrice, before explaining why it is not so. While ‘Jacob Wilde’ may have similar wit and observational skills, he is much unlike the original Oscar, and in my opinion, better. Wilde was filled with witty sayings, and points of society, as is Jacob... Yet, Jacob has a much more eternal impact- positively, anyway. It is for the very fact that he has a relationship with Jesus that gives his words much more of my attention than the old classic.  Yet, if the two stood side by side, and each spoke who would you listen to and be most influenced by? As Christians, do we usually listen to the Oscar Wilde or the Jacob Bentley?  He lacks a sense of humor, unbiased view, a hairline and a scientific background. The bags under his eyes make him look like a sad dog, and his slow, modern style is just dragging on forever. Skepticism is guarding my ears, and not a thing passes through.  Conviction hits:  So, is he speaking God’s Truth or not?  So far, in all honesty, I’ve been acting and hearing as if he isn’t. And so it comes to this, am I really ready to admit: “No, he does not have the Spirit of God, and what he says is not Truth”? No, I’m not. Blasphme of the Holy Spirit, as well as discrediting the Bible isn’t exactly the straight path to being more like Christ- it’s not going to make me an effective, new kind of Christian.  I’m not saying that he’s  not  speaking the truth,  I thought. Then why I am not listening and accepting?  And on the other side, we are so quick to listen to ‘enlightened’ secular resources without a thought.  They’re professional, witty, unbiased and really know what they’re talking about,  we rationalize.  I am so guilty of it. We need to stop this, I need to stop this. A healthy sense of skepticism is definitely not a horrible thing, but we need to be completely equally skeptical towards each side, and most times more skeptical towards the world, and not fighting off our own supports within the church. This is half of the problem, we are skeptical and jaded towards Christians, yet let the ideas of anyone else buzz through our heads day and night. Scrutinize everything with the same scale, anything less is injustice. Just as I constantly compare what I hear preached to what I know of the Bible and of God, I need to hold the same standards of comparosin for secular messages.     Please, let's have a little justice.   (I would really like Sir Josh of Lambsticks to write more on this topic, and will hopefully suggest it to him soon.)   ----------------------------------------------------   Grace   The other half of the problem is simply lack of reverence for the Word, no matter the messenger.  Jesus says to be on the watch for false prophets, however, we are not to judge them by their wit, knowledge or label (liberal, conservative, anyone?), but by their fruit (Matthew 7).  Can it be seen that he loves Christ? Is he making a difference in the Kingdom?  There is an obvious answer to those who are not Christians, and of course we must listen to the world in order to love, learn and be relevant...but we seem to have really lost a sense of value for God’s truth- the Bible.  While before we spoke of being just and fair in all that we scrutinize, when it comes to God we must realize one of His very own attributes must come into play during our interactions with speakers, preachers and teachers...and it starts with a 'G.' Whether its a sweaty old, biased, out-of-touch man from a ragety old family Bible (ick) or a cool, slick youth leader reading from ‘The Extreme Teen Youth Bible!’ (more ick), we must realize that the Word is Truth. While we may not agree with much, or even most of what the speaker is saying, we must continue to trust that God has something to tell us through His Word- and through that fault-laden person that His very  Spirit  dwells within. Yes, fault-laden. (and yes, dwelling of the Spirit!). It is when we listen and consider despite faults that, whether we learn anything from the sermon or not, we learn a valuable lesson about  grace,  and it is that that must be ever present in our interactions with everyone- from our syblings to our pastors.     Please, let's have even more grace.   And lastly to my own quick shout-offs in my head that  God can’t use him!...    Many a time, my youth leader would say it with a chuckle: “Boy! God spoke through a donkey, he sure ain’t gonna have a problem using any normal human being.”

        "We play our albums on beat up guitars/ and we sing songs of worship under the stars/ singing 'Thank you Lord, it's been a good life,"/ "it's been pretty good, it's been pretty good!"   &nbsp;  After seeing Insomniac Folklore play nearly a week ago, my dear friend and I have been singing these lines of 'Grey Cars.' And it's been true, I've had a good life- and&nbsp;especially very good summer.   I do believe I have been provided with many (if not all) of the great things one needs to be live (as opposed to living, as Jacob Wilde has differentiated between). Security, challenge, work,&nbsp;leadership,&nbsp;intellectual activity, a&nbsp;relationship with Christ... and others that are needed to&nbsp;really live. I could use a bit less drama here and there, but I can definitely  live  with it.   It's been a good summer, it's been pretty good, it's been pretty good!   &nbsp;As I was reflecting upon life and the world on such a positive high, I was considering the potential beauty of human society, and separate cell societies. An example of this was this was our ageless afternoon. Coincidentally,&nbsp;it was Brian’s birthday. As two female 17-year-old’s, one male 17-year-old and two other males: 20 and 22. All there, to be with Brian on his 14th birthday. Despite the fact that it was Brian’s birthday, it had no feeling of a special occasion, nor was it as if the olders had decided to be special and grace this young 14-year-old with their presence, but rather it was a typical friendship of common interest , good times and ‘The Secret Song’ (It may be noted, however, that Josh and Brian are officially Madden addicts).   It was a beautifully fun Ageless Afternoon of The All-Stars. It had been pretty good, it had been pretty good!

       This is my artistic license. I may now place words where I will, trusting that no matter what is written, it will be me recorded into language. For even lies will be lies I would tell, fronts will be fake versions of myself (not others) and mistakes and misrepresentations will be committed by me. This will be me.    In order to create a completely random thought, one must be self-originating (as God is) and for the thought to be the first, and possibly the only thought thought. If I say, “Kyanne has been doing quite fine,” and then immediately state that “this rock will fall at the unusual rate of 65 meters per second,” even if there were no trains of thought, this is not random- it is linked. They both fall into the category of  “that which is within the universe,” and even more importantly, are linked and not random- for both thoughts originated in my mind.  While this definition may not be official, nor credible, it does an adequate job of explaining how the various writings following are not random; even if I were to attempt it, I could not create anything random. The simple fact that a word written is considered by the writer important enough to be recorded is, in itself, the writer’s theme; a theme of worthwhile, un-intentionally purposed words. For, with purpose or not, the writer's mind has sovereignty over his own hands, and control over which words show up in front of him. Each sentence a record of the writer’s mental activity (for nothing can be written without being thought), enough to, if nothing else, tell the story of the author's mind.  I come to the conclusion that no matter how different and random thoughts, words, and works of the same creator may seem, they will always have that connection of origination; the human mind is far too complex to  not  be such a vortex. It is my hope that because all these thoughts originate in the same mind and heart, a link among them all will, by the end, be found.

       (Originally titled, A Start: Soft-hearted Angst, Bandwagons and Pink)  Second time around. For some strange reason, I was unable to log into my previously created account. So I am restarting, with a new URL, and the same name...  I gave in. I held out after   urlLink  http://www.outletofinsanity.blogspot.com/   , but after my dear friend Josh came out with   urlLink  http://www.lambsticks.blogspot.com/    I just couldn't resist the temptation.   I have considered continuing writing at   urlLink  http://www.mergemag.net/   , however I prefer to leave that untouched, as tribute and memory of that period of life. And now, with the summer, I am embarking upon a new one.  A bit of brainstorming...   urlLink  http://www.relevantmagazine.com/    had an article on blogs lately, and wisely advised to only publish what you are comfortable with ANYONE reading. As much of my writing I would prefer NO ONE reading, I will find a balance- out of the comfort zone, but not within the danger zone. I may be straining these words out of myself. This will be me on a page. With that in mind, I predict that more often than not, you may sense soft-hearted angst, which may be a semi-accurate way of describing me a majority of the time. I also love jokingly placed elitism (and sometimes with no humor), especially in the realm of music.  Why the pink, you ask? I wasn't quite sure which colors to choose, however, my friend Val repeatedly calls me 'fruity,' (despite the fact that proof  is many times standing next to me) and so, as they say: "When you're not sure, Val speaks relative truth."

       My life feels like a coming of age movie, these days.  It's all the normal things, finding identity, discovering how I relate to society, friends, the opposite sex. Deciding what I want out of life: my goals. Then the part about now being able to hold my life together, or at least feel normal about it. And then there is, of course, the daily writing. Yep, definitely a coming of age flick.  Speaking of, I would love to take on the daunting task of writing the screen play of one of those. The title would be really long, like an emo song title. And my main character's name would be Josiah.  Josiah would work as a coach at a Christian soccer camp. He would stay up late discussing ideas with his housemate, or spends the early hours of the morning writing. He would attempt to begin a small sort of church group. I would write in a girl he had a crush on, and just because of the way the movie went, she would reject him with good reason, actually via her actions and a third party. Part of his internal conflict would be options as to whether he would follow his affections, or merely let her be a standard and inspiration in future endeavours. Or would he do neither, and act flippantly and wildly? I would write in some good time with solid friends. Sometimes he would go on walks at night placing flowers at significant places. There would be a scene where he kisses a girl he hasn't seen in three years (and barely knows), in the park when she asks him. He would like to be with friends, and sometimes when he's with friends he likes to be alone. He would have this unrealistically enchanting idea of "Portland the Freeland" as he had written in his journal three months before. He might toss it all on his next destination and decide there who to be. Maybe he would continue being a walking paradox. Maybe not. Maybe he would decide to begin to make sense, and be dedicated and faithful to one way of life.  And throughout all that happened he would have a sort of blank, detached manner. The last words would be a voice-over. "Some people like to set themselves up to observe others; I like to set myself up to observe myself."

       'Is this all the world is?' I asked in disappointment. So much had let me down. Relationships were gone, and that part of myself that reminds me that girls (at least the ones I like) generally don't like me was very loud. I wasn't feeling sorry for myself, but it just became very clear... 'Well, obviously, that's not what life is about' I concluded within myself. Friendships had been sort of failing me, as well. It's not one person in particular, it's just that my social life has not been what I expected it to be. Lastly, the worst, all the ideas Zayne, Jacob and I had... It was as if the last few weeks had been a knock back to reality. The church can't be that way; change won't come that easily. Not to mention that my view of Christianity, my relationship with Christ... it was wrong, it wasn't working. A crisis of faith, as they say. Everything had let me down.      But I wasn't feeling sad; no self-pity or blatant bitterness. I escaped pain by apathy. If I didn't care, I couldn't be disappointed. If life meant nothing to me, then it had no power to hurt me. And so I took away it's power. I just didn't value much, kind of drifted through. It begins to kill you after a while. I wasn't sad, but it did remind me of my times of depression in China. It's not quite grief or sadness, but more like being numb. I was numb.       I walked about, and 'Gloria' by Brave Saint Saturn began:       Too weak to wonder, too tired to care     Jesus Christ, are you really there?       I can remember, standing there with my headphones on, in my own little world, surrounded by dozens upon dozens of people. I was within my own bubble, within the womb. They had no idea, and it was if I was watching them from a one-way window, my own glass case. All was silent to me, save the soft guitar... It was then that I began to feel again. Aside from friendships, relationships and religion, there had to be something else, something deeper. And there was. It hit me in that moment. It was beautiful, it brought life again. The song continued.       Your love     Your mercy     Your light unending     Your hope     Your peace     Your strength my heart is mending.         And I begin to live again.

       Nora and I had broken up the night before, and as I said, all was well. But for some reason or another these stupid flippant remarks kept coming out of my mouth. Impolite and generally insensative. Cynical and sarcastic, too.  I think it's because I want to prove that I'm not hurt- or maybe simply because I am. "Look, I'm fine." I want to say. Secondly, I think I'm really not sure how to act. "Hm, I'm not sure what to do, let's just go with this..." I think I also want to prove that I'm not controlled by anything, not controlled by my discomfort: "Look, I can act outside of my character!"  So tonight came, and I didn't expect to, but I think I didn't feel particularly well due to a couple of situations. And so I went and did it. I was flippant. Then I began to wonder why I was flippant, then I wrote this post. And here we are.

       I like the O'Neil's house because it reminds me of places other than Roseburg. It's warm, friendly and inviting. It's modest, as well, but it is also a nice house. The game room is one of the coolest places ever, to hang out. It's soft, but bright and clean. During the night, I realized why I liked it so much.      Many of the places outside of Roseburg (in the U.S., that is) that I have been have been nice, like the O'Neil's house. My cousins' friends houses, their church in Beaverton, other places. The O'Neil's house is like a fragrant whiff of life and places outside of Roseburg.      [Another thing I realized is that Brian is one of the coolest middleschooler I know. I simply listened to him for 5 minutes and noticed that in word and manner, there is no way you could distinguish him from any highschooler, or college student even...or older. It is a very cool thing.]

       Josh was headed out to the O'Neil's with the intent of spending the evening with Brian, playing Madden 2005, which they were both very excited about. I really had no interest, but I came along anyway. The thought of spending the home alone was unbearable. I had spent so much time alone, it was pushing toward an unhealthy amount. I needed to get out.      And so I went. As I said, I wasn't entirely interested in the game. There was another group upstairs watching the Olympics, which I wasn't really interested in either. Although I rarely spoke throughout the night I came to be around people. I sat at the bottom of the stairs, alone in the hallway, positioned midway between the upstairs and the room with Josh and Brian playing Madden. I was reading, but I wanted to hear people's voices. Just to hear people's voices...

       Two weeks ago I heard it everywhere, "Jacob is such a great writer..." I must've heard half a dozen comments on Jacob's writing within four days or so. This past week it's been about his song writing. It's actually getting nearly ridiculous.      Yes, Jacob is a very good, even great writer, and also a great lyricist in that he is quite talented in lining and rhyming words. He's also one of my closest friends. It should also be said that I am not jealous of him, and once again that I think he is a very good writer, friend, person over all.      But really, do you, his reader, enjoy the things he has been writing lately? I'm not saying you won't, not saying you can't, not saying I don't. I am saying, however, that it's not necessarily the sort of thing that appeals to the masses as it did when he first began. He admits himself, he is simply keeping the habit of writing, and thus typing without inspiration. Even that is worth being read, but yet: He's getting applause from the masses, when really, it's not mass-appeal stuff. I would even argue that whether he is or not, we all think he is an amazing writer because it's the "cool" thing to say or think- we hear it everywhere so it must be true. Such a great trend...      I mean, 'cause, Jacob is such a great writer.

       My life has been a little strange lately. I had made plans for Friday, also happening to be excited to hang out with a friend that had been gone a week. It was 10:30, and would be a little while before I engaged in social activity. I sat on the couch for a while... decided to do something constructive: write on my blog, and then make an attempt at cleaning the bathroom. Then I returned to the couch.       One friend was babysitting until 2:00, but I was hoping to hang out with second friend a bit before that.  I'll wait 'til 12:00 to call.  And so I did, and she was busy with her family, but would call me when she could hang out. It was a long day of waiting: reading, sleeping, listening to music, I also watched  The Nightmare Before Christmas . I wanted to go on a walk, but reasoned that going on a walk was not worth it if I were to miss a call- that is, any interaction with another person. It rolled around to be 4:00 and I was still on the couch. I also called a third friend, who had gone to a movie, but I called him later He said he would call when we got tired of reading, which he did. It was around 6:00 that Josh, Rick and Jean finally got home, and I was finally off that couch. It was a quarter 'til 8:00pm that I finally stepped outside the door of my house.      The next day I awoke early to be at work at 7:00am. I finished at 6:00pm. Simply said it was a long, hot day standing out with only the driving-by cars and the occasional friendly ticket-taker. My mind ran through circles and maximum-freight trains of thought. It continued to cultivate that new world within my mind that had made much progress the day before.      Come Sunday afternoon, I had a horrible time being social. It just didn't come natural, infact, people annoyed and agitated me.  Obviously they don't understand the rules of the world,  I thought  Or wait, maybe that's the world I've created in my mind during isolation. I'm really not to sure anymore...

       My friends are being picked off one by one. After my 11 hour day of working traffic control in the hot sun, I felt like being social. I mentally ran lists through my head and then realized that it's just Josh, Rick, Jean and I for the night. Which is actually great, I really like hanging out with Josh. After my long day, Josh picked me up and I did tell him that I was glad it was him. Yet, I came home to find that many of my friends were busy, and three gone.  I'm not sure where I'm going with this. The point was to write a light-hearted post to balance out and build a bridge between the two surrounding it, as I don't mean them to be connected.  Now look back and see what was wrong with that... You just fell for that metaphor! I know you did! Now, if I didn't want them to be connected why would I build a bridge? It should be actually be a wall. However, the truth about that is, I actually fell for my own metaphor. I caught it at the last second, and if you didn't, you're only a last second behind, except that I'm the writer, which means I should be a second or two ahead. In the end, you win.  By the way, I'm considering honesty.       Honesty like Jeff Suffering. Maybe.

       My life is falling apart. It feels as if I am dragging on my summer. I don't understand what's happening. What I want to do I don't do, but what I hate I do. I'm not hardcore as Paul, infact, I'm not hardcore at all. When my cousins asks me about all that I'm doing for God, I'd rather talk about girls or the latest Underoath CD. My emotions won't fit into what should be, I can't seem to control my own attention. Speaking of, most Christian music has lost its appeal. C'mon guys, you gotta be shitting me, it's really not that easy. While 'secular' music doesn't provide me any more comfort, give me some emo, take me away in mental theatrics. I have a friend who doesn't want to be baptized, and my initial response was to set myself above her, and then first realize this is the very reason I don't want to change, when I change... I look down. God's grace dissappears. Secondly, I realized if I had the chance again, and someone asked me now if I wanted to get baptized, I may or may not. I wouldn't want to, but in 'dedication and comittment' might still lie to a crowd of people by dunking my head. I'm disappointed in myself. Is this really who I am? My life is out of control, I speak too much truth, I can't get back my front of 'Spiritual disciplines' that once assured me of my Christianity. I read the Bible, but in all honesty, it may as well sit on the shelf. I can't seem to react to it, I can't seem to get help from it. If I really loved God, if I was really right with Him, there wouldn't be all this blurred confusion.  I want to be the normal me... I need to muffle my thoughts and feelings, throw myself back into the rut of righteousness. I want help, but, actually- nah, no thanks. It's a hard toss up, I want to be me, but I don't want grace to leave again.

       As I was just finishing my walk, I came upon a skunk. And so I moved to the other side of the road. Yet, I began to smell it even more so, and looked over in time to find that there was another skunk, coming out of the bushes on the other side, about 6 feet down. And so, as I did not want to be sprayed, I moved across the road again, and another 6 feet down...yes, you guessed it. Another skunk.  It'd be cool if I could connect this to something as an illustration. Or it would just be cliched, and prove that I many times feel bound to make something meaningful, and must have a deeper meaning. So this time, I will choose to not.

       urlLink  http://www.hisandhearse.com/deepelmaudio/sound_418_yel.mp3        "The night has come so let's go for a ride     It's these simple things that keep us alive..."    -Logh      Tonight Josh and I were driving home and it was perfect. Coldplay was on and the darkness covered all except our small section of enlightenment on the road ahead and the occasional illuminated street signs. I love riding in cars, I love riding in cars at night.    We continued on, past Hucrest. We approached the light at Garden Valley and Stewart Park. The eerie street lights fed my lust for night adventures. The light turned green, and we pursed further. Within minutes we found ourselves on the on-ramp, and then down the freeway. The breath catches in my chest as I realize this is truthfully blissful feeling: Gone.

        I did not only get up off of the floor, but also spent the afternoon with a friend, it was a pleasant time together.    At youth group this year, David and Bethany Jackson have been telling the story of the Bible, from creation, ad next week will be at the birth of Jesus. Yet, it’s a "real story" without verses or footnotes. They tell us the story with their own mouths, with the help of pictures (beautiful drawn by Melissa Rountree). It’s just like when you tell your friends the story of your weekend.  I’ve been really quite bored. And I don’t think the story tellers are to blame. It really does seem that in our culture, for one reason or another, we have lost the love of stories. I’m not sure why that is, and don’t really want to explore the different theories, but I will state that it is true: We’ve lost our love of stories.  Secondly, I personally rarely enjoy stories. My favorite movies I usually appreciate for their atmosphere or message. ‘The Village’ was amazing, but I realized apart from the great plot, it was the color and general visual/audio feel of the film that captivated me. After that, it was the symbolism and message that I most enjoyed. I know, I’m lame. Or at least artistic.

      I was just now laying on the floor watching the ceiling fan. I discovered something very cool: When you close your eyes, you can see the specific places the blades were the second you closed them.  I decided to get back up on the chair, but I might get back down. I might go lay on my bed. I sit down on the couch. I might continue to do nothing all day. I might consider searching my mind for some sort of purpose. I might try to make myself want one. I might try to face this lethargicism. I might try to avoid it by embracing it. I might pick up a book. I might call a friend. Probably not. I'm going to lay back on the floor.

       He started in through the gate, I took a step in front of the car.  Of course, he thinks he's the exception.  And sure enough, as I walked around the side, not only was he wise enough to make adjustments on our traffic system, he was nice enough to condescend into my thinking and comfort me, "Don't worry buddy, I'm just dropping these two girls off," Yes, except, they set up the green zone exactly for that...and this was not it. "You can go to the green zone (temporary drop-off point) and say, 'Don't worry, I'm just dropping these people off.'" I wanted to tell him, "There, in the green, you can be the exception all you want!"  Darn it, I'm getting really sarcastic. It is true though. And then I thought about how many times I think I'm the exception. I am worthy of being accused, but I have a feeling so are you sometimes. Infact, maybe many of us are. Most of us. We are the exception.  And my cousin just wrote: "because love life sucks like usaull but then other life is really good so it comes out to ok"  A happy thought for those of us that can say "We are the single."

       I've been doing even more thinking about drama. Actually, specifically, how I can have less drama during the rest of the summer. In me, there are those who inspire drama and those who exterminate drama. I have one friend, for one reason or another can stir up a boatload of drama in the situation, and then in my head. I have other friends who, the moment I am near them, replace all my drama with things that really matter- such as fun, friendship...and dare I set it aside from romance?    Sometimes drama is about what is said or not said, many times, that's all it is.           Many people believe the best way to avoid drama is to "bottle it up" (as I mentioned earlier). Don't talk about it, don't say a word about it. I've tried this, many a time.   I've come to a conclusion: It does not work well for those of us who wear our hearts on our sleeves. If my tongue does nothing, it means nothing- somehow my emotions still escape.        So, as Jacob proclaims his own, I am declaring a new theory. Maybe if I verbally admit to what the rest of me shows, I may be better off. Maybe it will help me make the decision to embrace or deal with it. I suppose we shall see...

       I am beginning to understand the Nazis. You wear a uniform- and you feel a part of something. Moreover, you feel a part of something that others who do not have a uniform are not a part of.  He went speeding by as I flagged my hands up, "You can't go that waaaay! It says 'Do Not Enter' for a reason!" Within seconds Sheriff Woods had his lights on, and had the car pulled over. It's just so cool when your words are backed by a man with power to issue a traffic ticket.  It was us vs. them. S&R vs. angry white trash. They werenyou't stopping, and so I stepped out in front of the car. I could see her yelling at me, but for some reason she thought the window was non-existant. Her tounge ring caught my eye as the lady in her late-20's, early 30's opened her mouth to blabber off about the man in the car (who's scraggly face was smoking a cigarette above a dirty shirt) that needed to turn his application in, and "We don't want to park, and we went down there, and they told us to come here, and you told us to go back down there." While I should have directed them  back  to the temporary drop-off zone, as I did the first time... I was weak and soft, and let them sit in the front parking lot for 10 minutes. Yet, that was an exception.      Working at the fair as a traffic controller was a very different sort of job compared to shoveling pine-needles at my grangparents house last summer, or even teaching a class of kindergarteners. It is strange, the effect that uniform has on me. I am representing something greater than myself. This seems to adhere me to a certain code of behavior. As people drive by, I nod and they do the hand-on-the-wheel-finger-wave. I am quick to answer questions and gladly give directions. I am, afterall, in a uniform and must follow a certain code of behavior. I am respectful, polite, gracious.... authoritative, objective, forceful. "DO NOT let anyone through this gate. NO ONE goes through it" he said, and so I carried the sentiment on throughout the day. Just as the idea sat in my head all day, "it is important, as a wearer of this uniform, to uphold the law; and to react to all those who do not. Infact, it is increasingly important... So much so, to the point of..." I can easily see men in a different uniform, feeling the  passion  and  purpose  of upholding the law and being dedicated to the good of society: ridding the nation of Jews.  Uniforms are dangerous things. Come Saturday, during those 11 hours I'll do my best to be the one wearing that beloved brown apparel...and not vice-versa.

       It was a warm, humid afternoon in the South American jungle. An average tribal man was standing on the side of the path. Another man came joggingly along and in tribal tongue asked him to run. The man agreed and they both kept their eyes on the road before them. And they enjoyed running together.  This is not a Christian illustration, for details are nearly all irrelevant. In a Christian illustration the man would be sitting along the road with a frown of loneliness set across his face. The man would be running toward a better place- perhaps a great fortress or refreshing river. Lastly, the man would have super-natural powers of love and kindness, as he would, in the illustration, be representative of Christ. None of this is so.  I am simply talking about being able to disconnect yourself from your prejudices, and disconnect others from their own. Let them be who they are, and the time with them what it is. While the men did not focus on what had happened in the past, nor ‘great times’ (or times of splitting) in the future, they made their current time worthwhile in itself... and they enjoyed it.

       I love drama. I can deny it, but everyone knows it. Many times I create drama within my head. It is usually best that way, because a majority of people don’t understand the rules of drama by which I play. My rules consist of guidelines that mean much fun, little action and minimal pain, if not none. This can also involve dramatic symbolism- such as flowers and other things. This is the sort of drama I keep to myself, or to the occasional close friend in joking circumstances (however, sometimes it’s not taken as lightly as it is meant). J.F. Yes, you know what I mean.  However, this love for drama many times prompts me to create it. I have decided, this is not a good thing. To that end, I took a step today: To be concerned with the drama of another. But that is belittling to call it drama. While it was drama, it was much more and much deeper. Nor was it dabbling in what was simply not my business, I was sincerely concerned, as I care for both sides. I was able to talk about it, and just as I love to create problems of my own so that I can solve them, I was able to talk through this problem and help to bring about the beginnings of a solution. Hm, maybe I will begin to give up my own drama. (I can hear long relaxed sighs of all my friends; yes, it’s beginning to become much safer to be my friend. That’s the hope, anyway.) ...Maybe I could use my appetite for it in a more constructive way.  And maybe, just maybe... God has a plan for us emo kids who love drama.

       Wow, I am really good at this. I said too much...again! I have this horrible habit of spilling my guts to the wrong person. "Those are just things you need to keep bottled up." I tend to be an open-lid ketchup bottle (the plastic, sqeezable kind, of course) underneath an elephant foot. "Splat!" and it flies everywhere. Although, I don't believe this to be entirely negative, either.    Also, I focus on conclusions much more than I do details. When I say something in the middle of the oral 'paragraph', but say something contradicting that in the end, it is the latter that should be taken as my meaning. For example, when my friend Josiah says, "I'm attracted to someone," "...but I will, in no way, act on it; it will be as if I am not." I will usually assume the latter to be true; and accept what he concludes as truth. It is many times in the details that I say too much, and am just horrible at realizing what should or shouldn't be said, I usually prefer saying it all, and then retracting bits to form an end message.This may be why I am a writer...and many times should simply keep to writing. When I speak I tend to say things that need not be said. My personality is sometimes not hesitant to say something- whether it be the wrong thing or not.  However, on the other side, I have rarely been slow to be honest about things that may encourage others- such as what God is doing within me, or how much a particular person means to me. I try to make a point of being transparent and open- open, the cap off.  I am just a ketchup bottle being stepped on by an elephant; I suppose in all positive and negative ways, all I have is honesty.

       I am too darn self-centered. I know it, I tend to focus on myself, and am really horrible at meeting other’s needs. Infact, tonight I feel like the biggest jerk I've ever met.  As simple as this prayer is:  Lord, please help me to be considerate, kind, loving and aware. I know you won't judge me, nor hold this view of 'the jerk Krispin', but instead will encourage and look for change in my life, as I pray for this change to begin in my heart. Amen.

         Three hours alone in the sun, and I came out with this:     August 5th, 2004     It’s the hardest of times and just as He usually comes and is there for me, answers my cry, reassures me I’m in the right direction- this time He didn’t. It was only as if He were holding me there. Not like a father holds a son from danger on the side of a mountain; no. He held me (as He still does) as a murderer holds his enemy underwater. A brutal facet of “grace.”    'Twas confirmed. We were to break up, yet when I asked how to go about it, He was silent. How am I to do this gracefully and with honor to her? I'm weak and broken. I'm inadequate, and just not sure where to go.  Silence.  He just holds me here, as I seem to suffocate.  I’ve been extremely disappointed in situations before, but this disappointment with God... I don’t think I’ve been here before.    [Yet, God answered my prayer:    urlLink   http://randomyousay.blogspot.com/2004/08/for-record-two-months-to-day.html      It was gracefully ended; divinely led, I believe. We're friends.]

        I had a friend, earlier, say my writing was quite good, eloquent, infact. However, also that it was a little impersonal. Ironically enough, it is now her that I will talk about. In a personal way.  We broke up. Two months to the day, actually (We met June 6th, we assumed a friends stance as of August 6th). Our relationship was not a failure, however. Nor a mistake. I very much enjoyed that season of my life, and just as it is good when two people come to the conclusion that “We do like each other and like to spend time together” it is also a good conclusion when two people mutually agree that they are not particularly so inclined toward one another, and don’t especially enjoy spending exclusive time together. Of course, if it’s only one side that decides this, you would end up with an emo kid. Fortunately, none were born this time around.  The basis? Twice a reason, and the first: We, each in turn, were squelching each other’s passion and relationship with Christ. Not that time is much of a measurement, but just the same, 17 years is different than 4 months. As much as I tried to not force anything, simply spending so much time, she wasn’t being allowed to form her own convictions and work out her own faith; I was feeling as if I had to conform to her not-yet-set convictions. Agreed on each side, it was a blunder, with no specific fault on either side. One may say, “You were so foolish to think this could work, and to hold on for so long.” I count ourselves fortunate to have wisdom enough to come to the realization now.  Secondly, I am two-faced. Actually, not. However, I will admit, I am a different side of myself when I write. Not a different or fake self, but a different side. Being a visual-text learner, I can use written words much more precisely and can be much more ‘collected’ when I write. It’s a sort of power when I’m on these keys, I can express myself accurately- something that can be quite difficult while I speak- though can be done in the right situations. The ‘Krispin’ that comes out in my writing is slightly different than the ‘Krispin’ that comes out when I speak (although in the right situations, with the right people, I do believe the two overlap). We just realized that while we really click when I write, it’s not so much so in person. We’re okay with that.  We had a great time of discussing all this last night. Online, actually, which was quite fortunate, as I was able to express myself better, as it was through writing. As some of you may know, I might say that my favorite movie is ‘You’ve Got Mail.’ I love the feel, the color, the music, the scenery- which actually is irrelevant. However, in one scene Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) and her boyfriend break up, and have a comfortably enjoyable time discussing their sides, and came to a friendly agreement. It was exactly that. Strange how much my life so often draws from that movie.  “Which of the bold-faced lies will we use?” Nora and I have none. Spiritually, being so closely tied was not healthy on either side, and while we really enjoy writing to each other, it was not quite so in ‘real life’ (as they say).  We’re friends and quite comfortable with that.

       Andrew Onswega (The Normals, songtitle: 'Quakeline'), interpretation mine:  I’m feeling a little existential tonight, every now and then I get this way. Something about night, not quite sure what...but my perspective is on the floor, next to her shoes at the door. My feet are being warmed by the fire, as she roles a bit closer. Let me get a little further, God, then I'll ask for that ‘way out’ You’ve promised. And I look to the novels on my shelf. Of course I’m not exactly on my guard today, but I do pride myself on not accepting everything I hear. The calendar moves faster and faster; my journal grows. I’m pretty sure I wrote these pages, but...how did I get here?  And I say to myself, “You’re building on a quakeline.” The fall starts here, I said to myself “You’re to blame." I, myself, am to blame.  Andrew does an excellent job of reminding me that everything is a step towards something.

        Finally,  I said to myself,  I've found the perfect color!  I brought it home to my wife, and she agreed. It was exactly the combination of blue and gray we had been looking for, and after looking at our 7th store, it was finally found.  We brought in samples, friends and even her parents were down for the weekend. Sure, it sounds like a big deal just over the color of our kitchen, but we were both horrible at decisions, and wanted to be satisfied- and we were. The kitchen was painted, and complete happiness abounded in that room of food-making.  Two months later, we decided to have a neighbor family over for dinner. We had pleasant conversation as our kids smeared each other’s blood on the... er, played nicely together. It was a typical evening, and for some strange reason my wife asked me to take Nedlenson and get the desert from the kitchen. I told him about how we had painted the kitchen since he had last been there. We stepped in, and just as I was about to blow for five minutes straight about our perfect color, he spoke the unthinkable. “Don’t you think it’s a little green?” “Oh, of course not,” I replied “We love it, we searched long and hard...and found the perfect color for us.” I said with complete confidence.  It was the next fall that our first two sons carved their first jack-o-lanterns, in our recently painted,  maroon -colored kitchen.  And you know it’s true. The power of spoken words to raise dormant thoughts is incredibly amazing. I, infact, have recently experienced it, due to you, oh cursed one, Jacob Wilde!

       This last year I have discovered Pedro the Lion. I was once so very struck by the song, ‘Second Best,’ which speaks of one of the most depressing atrocities ever: infidelity. I can’t imagine the feelings of heartbreak, sorrow, rejection and betrayal that would be forced onto someone. I believe it would be so painful as to possibly numb them to a state of torturous apathy. While the husband does his best to conceal it, it is quite obvious to the wife- leaving her to learn how to deal with it, with being ‘second best’: g  The empty movements that once were so inspired   Desperate attempts to fan the flames without a fire   The mattress creeks beneath   The symphony of misery and cum   Still we lie jerking back and forth   And blurring into one   Second best, oh second best   I can learn to live with this   Plus I really need a rest     After all, what's wrong with second best   As Bazaan (Pedro) writes in another song, ‘Rehearsal’: “ You know I've always said that I would kill you / If I ever caught you stepping out/ But now I see I did not know the half of/ What hatred and regret were all about ” Infact, in the story of  Control , the wife ends up murdering her husband. Intense heartache with only the shortest strand of hope (and sometimes none).  Lately, I’ve been listening to the album,  It’s Hard To Find a Friend  and have listened to, multiple times, a song that I don’t know the name of. The chorus burned me, and I hated listening to it. Despised it, as it cut to the very core! I once thought it must be the worst thing in the world to be betrayed in an act of infidelity, but I had never imagined the idea of continuing to love despite such a horrid offense. It made me sick to my stomach as he sang:   Come home, darling    Come home quickly    Come home, darling      All is forgiven, so come home quickly   Alright, let’s skip that song... Until I play the album again, and it starts again,  Come home, darling, come home quickly.  Please stop!  And then tonight, walking home under a blue moon, it hit me. This is the painful love Christ has given us. What is closer to serving other things than our God, than having sex with people other than our spouse? It’s sickening, repulsive, heart-breaking...crucifying. This was the message God was demonstrating through Hosea, when he re-accepted his adulterous wife multiple times. He sang, to her...and God sang to us:     Come home, darling Come home quickly Come home, darling All is forgiven, so come home quickly   Suddenly it was a heart-achingly joyful song. Again, was a message to my heart... I had been harboring guilt and regret, wondering whether God would forgive these atrocities.  All is forgiven, so come home quickly.      It was at the point I went to discover the song’s name for reference in this article, and found it was called: “Of Minor Prophets And Their Prostitute Wives” I was correct, through a sort of circle about ;)

       That cursed body of water known by the fiendful name of Shasta has taken my friend, Sir Lambsticks. In heroic effort, I shall travel afar, with all my might, that we may be reunited. It’s been a depressing past two nights. “I’m going home and am going to be alone” I’d say, “No one will be there, tonight.” No nightly debriefing, sitting by the computer talking of “life and love and why”. Just wait, Sir Lambsticks, I am coming!  Oh, fortune has paid well tonight, we have a stand in. Or wait, come to think of it, is Josh the stand in? After each morning of social happenings online, I would go work (teaching English) and then come home and sit in the kitchen, while my mom made dinner. We talked of many things: girls, friends, music, Christianity, her teenage years... This summer Josh has been a faithful stand-in. I suppose we’ll see who is brought next...  Although, it may be noted Josh is an excellent observer...my mom is an excellent accuser. “I can tell [this or that] in the way you write,” she said. Durn, what made my mother so intuitive?
