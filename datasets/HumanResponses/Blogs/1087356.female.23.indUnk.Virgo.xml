      We drove the car To the top of the parking ramp Fourth of July  Sat out on the hood Couple warm beers And watched the fireworks Explode in the sky  And there was an exodus  Of birds in the trees Cuz they didn't know We were only pretending  And the people all looked up  And were pleased And the birds flew around  Like the whole world was ending  And you can't leave me here Now that you're back you better stay this time Cuz you say, the coast is clear But you say that...all the time  So many sheep, i quit counting Sleepless and embarressed  About the way that i feel  Trying to make mole hills Out of mountains Building basecamp at the bottem Of a really big deal  And did i ever tell you  how i stopped eating... When you stopped Calling me  And i was cramped up Shitting rivers for weeks  And trying to convince myself I was finally free  And you can't leave me here! Now that you're back you better stay this time Cuz you say the coast is clear But you say that all the time  We drove the car To the top of the parking ramp Fourth of july  Planted my dusty boots  On the bumper Turned my head And looked up at the sky  ~Ani Difranco     "Independence Day"

      **DiSCALiMER** This is ROMANTiC love. Just so you don't confuse it with certain other types.  Love is, in all reality, an inexperiencable emotion. It is but a mirage in out minds, which they themselves are filled with lies and nailed shut with hopes of maintaining the lie. Half the population of this earth is incapable of experiencing the emotion, and since it's supposed to be a mutual feeling, the other half can only fool itself into thinking it experiences it. They can feel the want for love, because they think it exists, but they cannot feel love itself. I do not recomment trying to feel love,for it will only leave you feeling empty, depressed, and deflated. Perhaps you may find that one person who pretends to experience it at the same time as you, but that one is almost always the one that gets away, leaving you, in the end, empty, depressed, and deflated. LOVE IS POINTLESS! LOVE IS BULLSHIT!  LOVE... IS... NONEXISTANT.                ~Mithearwen  good luck matt.....

      hi! well.. i've had a tiring week. Woo.. i had to get up early everyday this week. I feel bad for you Prov people because you had to get up even earlier that i did for aa normal school day. I had to work on batiks in my art class. A batik is a form/stlye of art where you sketch something on a peice of paper, go over it in marker, and then transfer it onto a peice of fabric. YOu then stretch that peice of fabric onto a canvas frame and start painting with hot (melted) wax. We get the wax color from crayons and some parafin wax. After you finish painting... you crumple up the fabric and dip it in dye and the place without any wax get dyed with blue black ink. It truen out really cool.. and i've been putting alot of time and effort into it.         Anyway, i have this friend emily, and she love LOTR, Harry Potter Books, and Anime. She has written a harry potter fanfic and i think some people here would enjoy it... prolly not.. but its worth a try. The URL is this: http://www.angelfire.com/realm2/hop_emily/ravenclaw.html   so if you would go there.. thanks! oh and by the way... its really more of a Pro-Draco Malfoy because well... they think that Harry Potter is a "stupid Pansy who gets by only because of his own dumb luck." so... yeah... I MYSELF AS THE GREAT GWEN IS MENTIONED IN one LINE OF THE STORY! i"m in ravenclaw. Anyway. i'm done..so ... GOODBYE! Love and Spaghetti,             Gweni   (with an i)

      Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-- While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. "'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--                      Only this and nothing more."  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore-- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--                      Nameless here for evermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door-- Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;                      This it is and nothing more."  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door--                      Darkness there and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"--                      Merely this and nothing more.  Back into the chamber turning, all my sour within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before. "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice; Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore-- Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--                      'Tis the wind and nothing more.  Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven, Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-- Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"                      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                      With such name as "Nevermore."  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered-- Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends have flown before-- On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."                      Then the bird said "Nevermore."   Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-- Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                      Of 'Never--nevermore.'"  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-- What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore                      Meant in croaking "Nevermore."  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er                      She shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"                      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!-- Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-- On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore-- Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"                      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore-- Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-- Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."                      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  "Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting-- "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"                      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                      Shall be lifted--nevermore!

      Mood: deflated Music: Martina McBride-Concrete Angel Hello all. Yes. The Laser Quest party WAS cancelled. that could be why i'm feeling deflated, or it could be because i've been listening to a song about child abuse for the past hour. What I need is a bike pump like in the cartoons. The other characters would pump the flat character up. Unfortunatly, it probably would have been in their best intrest to leave the charater flat. Hm.... I probably didn't mean i was literally deflated when i wrote that. Wait a gosh derned minute here! The word deflated has the word flat in it! deFLATed...cool...If you look down, you can see that I have been taking many a quiz. It seems like fun, and it is. Feel free to take the quizes, but do not bother me with your reults...for I care not..Tis' pretty outside, no? Tis annoying,yes...but pretty. Maybe pretty annoying.Just looking at it sends my minds into spasms of red lights. Maybe i should see a doctor. In other news, Cheeks was being rather optimistic last night. BOO!

You are sure of your identity, therefore, you cannot change others or be changed. You are a true prince, you may be forgotten, but without you, none of us could go on.

I hope it is a surprise for Brian. I don't want Kevin to come. Just say no to....Incense. Any idiot who would think that pot smelled like incense needs to have their head re-examed. Unless of course their names are Debbie, and they are saying it to their gay son. Thats okay. Who here has heard of Echo and the Bunnymen? Or Modern English? They are good bands....well...

      Mood: Content...and kinda confused..but still happy Music: "Who will save your soul" By Jewel Hello! We had our Science Olympiad Competition today! By the way! Kudos to Emily on her OM (Odessy of the Mind) Competition! My partner Sruthi(pronounced Shruthi) and I had two catagories. Science Crime Busters (with forensics and stuff) and Experimantal Design (where we get materials and work out a project). Well, it was Thursday, two days before the competition, and our (oh, so smart) Science Teacher, the lovable Ms. Cox, signed us up for something called "Balloon Race." Fabulous. Anyway. In Ballon Race, you have to figure out how much cardboard that you can attach to the bottem of the Balloon and have it still rise. Funny enough, even though Sruthi and I went in there and basically jerked around for ten minutes, as it turned out, It was the only catagorie we placed in. Yes, we were Fourth, but still! We tried with the other two, and not that one! Fab-Fuckin-Tabulous. Well... still... I guess i am a little happy. I still hope you did well emily! It was FUNNY!          The other day, I decided to sit with my other friends and let them read  a fanfic i had read. Well, Emily, being Emily, was pissed. I thought it was funny, but then I started to get worried, because her "I hate you"s were getting more and more serious. Well, i was sitting in art, and she passed by, slipping me a note. I opened it, to find this: Dear Gwen,         I find it disgusting that you would rather work on your reputation as a dirty, perverted slut, than sit at lunch and talk to Linda, Peter, and me.          Plus i am angry about ten different other things that have nothing to do with you. ~Emily      Now, lets stop and analyze the situation. I didn't sit with her at lunch, and she called me a dirty, perverted slut. I don't know about you, but i find that harsh. Especially when you say it like its a bad thing! ^_^  Of course as everybody knows, I am too lazy to hold a grudge, so, five minutes later, I was sitting by her side, laughing about how hilarious it would be if Dumbledore had called McGonagall a dirty perverted slut, or something to that effect.         Well, I must go mush. To those who are not familiar with that word, to mush means to go layback and go into a catatonic state after a day of much MUCH MUCH MUCH hard thinking. I give hugs to everyone!  ~Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you, and you sold me~  ..::Bella Luna::..

Sometimes...when i'm laying in bed, trying to fall asleep, I picture that i have someone holding me...someone just there for me to rest my head on. Someone to keep me warm. Someone to hold my hands together to keep them warm. Some one to not care if i don't listen, but only talk.  That someone, whoever they are, can make me forget everything. I can't wait till i have something like that. I don't care how long i have to wait. 5minutes, 5 decades. as long as i have that feeling sometime. *silence*  ~Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree I sold you, and you sold me~  ..::Bella Luna::..

He is a stupid Bigot. I'm not sure why, but he is. Someone shoot me. I'm in a right mood. Someone kill me. Why would you want to rape and kill an Austrailian Nurse who never hurt you? Why can sisters be bitches sometimes? Why can't everyone love everyone else? WHY!?? He asks her if she is improving. She says feels fine, its wonderful, wonderful here.... I am in a BAD mood.

      I wrote a crappy ass poem. I dun know why, but i feel like putting it down anyway.  ~Invisible Bird~ Once upon a time, there was a Girl. her name was tracy. she loved a Boy very much. his name was john. John did not love tracy like she loved him, but  They remained good friends for a long time. Tracy grew older, a got more beautiful, and  Became even closer with john. people Started to notice her, even a boy named micheal.  He was older than her. she was very happy to  Have him. tracy and micheal were very happy Together, but something was wrong. during The time that the two were together, john began  To realize how much he loved tracy, but tracy Didn't still like him, did she?  Tracy started to come to school with bruises, and John got concerned. tracy told him to mind his own business,  But he couldn't! so one day, john saw a BIG bandage on  Tracys back. she said it was nothing, but John didn't beleive her. he asked her If she wanted him to redress it for her. She said that would be nice. he took off The old bandages, and replaced them with New ones. he was very gentle. she turned to  Face him. she didnt realize how close he was, and Came almost face to face. she said that there was something She had wanted to do for a long time. she reached up And kissed him. then she ran away. the next day Tracy didn't come to school. her sister looked sad. When john asked what was wrong, lucy, tracys sister, said That tracy was in the hospital. John, remembering the bruise, and still  Feeling the kiss, ran to the hospital. tracey Lay on a stretcher, unconcious. he stood over  Her. he could smell the blood. he cried A little. but then went to find micheal.  John fought micheal and won, greatly. John went to the hospital, and found That tracy had gone into surgery. During the surgery, john walked in the Room. He bent over, and just before he  Whispered 3 words in her ear, her eyes burst Open, and her arm reached up as if trying to  Catch an invisible bird,  Then her heartline went flat.                               "I love you"  ~2 + 2 = 5~ ..::Bella Luna::..

I want to write it. FUNFUN!  If you but knew How all my days seemed filled with dreams of you How sometimes in the silent night Your eyes thrill through me with their tender light How oft I hear you voice when others speak How you  midst other forms I seek Oh, love more real, than though dreams be true If you but knew  Could you but guess How you alone, make all my happiness How i am more than willing, for your sake to stand alone, give all, and nothing take Nor chafe to think you bound while i am free Quite free til death to love you silently Could you but guess  Could you but learn How when you doubt my truths, I sadly yearn To tell you all for one brief space Unfettered, soul to soul, as face to face To crown you king, my king, til life should end, My lover and likewise, my truest friend, Would you love me, dearest, as fairly in return? Could you but learn?  I like that poem? do you? tell me.   ~Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree I sold you, and you sold me~ ..::Bella Luna::..

I'm gonna marry Jack White. Hell, I'll marry Meg too, If I can. Just for the fact that I get to marry the White Stripes. Uh... The concert kicked ass. I loved it. They played..uh... Opened with: Black Math Then in the middle they played: Jolene((Dolly Parton Cover)), Apple Blossems, Union Forever, Seven Nation Army, We're gonna be Friends, Hardest Button to Button, See my face before I turn invisible, St.James Infirmary, You're Pretty Good Lookin (For a Girl), In the Cold, Cold Night, Hotel Yorba, Dead Leaves on The Dirty Ground, Little Room, Hello Operator, and a couple more. They did an encore with: Ball and Biscuit  I had a great time, and i got a SHIRT! AH! I got offered, coke, and ecsatsy from this big nice guy, who was only joking..((I think)) I got to be in the SAME ROOM as JACK WHITE! It was fabulous. AND MEG WHITE! AH! I'm gonna post a song of theirs that I just LOOOOVE SOOOOO MUCH!!!! ~The Air Near My Fingers Life is so boring Its really got me snoring I"m wearing out the flooring  In a cheap hotel But I don't have to work and I might be sinning But I never have to listen to The Rings of school bells  Don't you remember? You told me in December That a boy is not a man  Until he maakes a stand Well, I'm not a genius But maybe you'll remember this I never said I ever wanted  To be a man  I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around  My mom is so caring Shes really got me staring At all the crazy little things She does for sure And I can't seem to think of Another kind of love  That a boy could ever get From anyone but her  I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around I get nervous when she comes around When she comes around When she comes around  ~White Stripes They didn't play that song at the concert... BUT IT WAS STILL GREAT!!!!!! Some Bitchy Jackass in the paper said ,"Meg stepped out from the drumkit to sing 'In the Cold, Cold, Night," but her voice is unremarkable and out of tune both on record and in person. She fared better singing an a capella duet with Jack on the showstopper "Hotel Yorba."" WHAT A JACKASS! I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE CALLED MEGS VOICE, "OUT OF TUNE" I'M GOING TO FIND HER, AND CASTRATE HER!!!! Anyway... This entry has run long enough.. so... I'm going to say good bye..  ~I"m gonna fight'em off A seven nation army couldn't hold me back~  ~**..::Reality::..**~

With a few changes as some of you *cough* emily*cough* will know.  The summer is here at last The sky is overcast And no one brings a rose for Gwendolyn  She watches her flowers grow While lovers come and go To give each other roses from her tree But not a rose for Gwendolyn...  Gwendolyn, can't you see There's nothing you can do? There's loving everywhere But none for you...  Her roses are fading now She keeps her pride somehow That's all she has protecting her from pain  And as the years go by She will grow old and die The roses in her garden fade away Not one left for her grave Not a rose for Gwendolyn...   Gwendolyn, can't you see There's nothing you can do? There's loving everywhere But none for you...  Her roses are fading now She keeps her pride somehow That's all she has protecting her from pain  And as the years go by She will grow old and die The roses in her garden fade away Not one left for her grave Not a rose for Gwendolyn...  ~Rose for Emily (Gwendolyn) By: Zombies  Depressing, no?

Stand. Sit. Heavy eyeliner. Actors. Talking in sentences. Packing. Playing. Fun. Songs. Candy Cane Children running about while I listen to the Apple Blossems. Getting up early and walking across the red grass to the white sunlight. Walking across the dead grass to the building where I will stand in front of the red people who sit quitely in their chairs and do not make a sound while I play the song of the crows sound at 700 in the morning. I will look at the and smile at them as the people who are not people come in in groups of 3,2,1 and start to tune what are instruments. And they play them. And I laugh at them. And I laugh at the red people sitting quietly in their chairs while Mr. Slocumb talks about them as if they are not there. But they are there. I see them. I laugh with them. To them, I am a star of Carnegie Hall even though I am really just a stupid little girl playing the song of the crows sound. The sqwaking goes on until those people who are not people come. Then they sqwak and we all sqwak together. And it sounds okay. Like a murder of crows. The black crows with red eyes. And the Candy Cane Children run about while I listen to the Air near my fingers and mourn the devil in his left hand. But the doctor says no way.  No way  I'm going away Devil in the car Murder of Crows Just a group Not an act Empty can Made of  Aluminum Like my heart and a rubber band with a  Drummer and Singer and Pink  Piano  ~Hey little Apple Blossem What Seems to be the problem All the ones you tell your troubles to  Don't really care for you~  ~Reality

He was in a car accident. Awful left turn in front of him. I cried. He broke his finger. Three different places. I'm losing people. I'm losing friends. I guess I should stop. I just feel like people are slipping away from me. Like they are slipping into that pool of depression that I once inhabited. Maybe a visit would be nice. But no, that exact person wouldn't like me to join them. They want to do it themselves. I miss my person. I miss my life. I miss feeling happy every single second of every single day. I miss trying to cheer up a person, but I can't do that anymore. And its not the persons fault. Its the people surrounding that person who are at fault. I miss Jack. I wish I knew him. I wish he knew me. I wish he would get better. I want to see his hand live.  I want to see his hair. The air near my fingers. A devils in this car. A devil was in his car. Meg is pretty. She is like a raven haired drummer. But I can see what she really is. I can see what he really is. Jack, I mean. He is more than just a singer. He isn't a singer. He is a friend. That can never slip away from me. One person I will have with me always.   I see you there That little shine Talk to me When I talk  To myself See me there Push me down Love me Kill me Give me back  Everything  I lost. Everything You took Away.  Stain my blood. My blood Stains. Don't read This. I just want To get back. To that world Of heaps Of hair Of a raven.  ~I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding And I'm bleeding Right before the Lord~  Reality

Music: "Volcano" by Damien Rice Pondering: *and then she was gone*  In a world of grey She wanted more than all To fly away Over the grey dawn wall  She went over the hills Over freshly cut lawns Over wind-powered mills And then she was gone  To be free of her strings Like the puppets of old To be free of the things She wished not to uphold  She climbed over the mountains From dusk until dawn She went pass dried up fountains And then she was gone  She cleared cobwebs from her eyes And oiled up her wings She forgot all the lies All the frivilous things  She had dreamed of the day She would no longer be a pawn She threw all thoughts away And then she was gone   ^_^ Do you like it? I wrote it.. but I got the idea from a show on Nickelodeon. My sources of inspiration are eclectic.. in a way... ^_^ anyway... I just felt like putting that... uh... yeah....  *and then she was gone*  ~I kissed your mouth, your back Is that all you need?~  ;;~**..::reality::..**~;;

      Mood: *giggles* I'm having fuuuuuun...... Music: "Volcano" by Damien Rice Pondering: Why did I want to post a second time?   It hits the point of contact... It vibrates and screams. It tells of lost love.... An adventure. It screams for hours... or a single second. Does it matter? You can live without it... but you can't live without it.  Silently screaming for a opening... Through a tooth lined cave... through a steady cramped hand.  Through a life... Through a death... It needs notice...  It goes without notice.     I love it...  I hate it... But I survive on it   You like my little definition of music? I'm bored out of my mind... So... I thought. Which probably isn't good in these situations....  ~She's still to young~  ;;~**::..reality..::**~;;

      Hey little apple blossem What seems to be the problem? All the ones you tell your troubles to  They don't really care for you.  So come and tell me what you're thinking Cuz just when the boat is sinking A little light is blinking And I will come and rescue you  Lots of girls walk around in tears But thats not for you. You've been looking all around for years  For someone to tell your troubles to.  Come and sit with me and talk awhile Let me see your pretty little smile Put your troubles in a little pile And I will sort them out for you  I'll fall in love with you  I think I'll marry you.

      Mood: ^_^ Fun! And sleepy... Music: "The Last Song" by All American Rejects Pondering: ^_^   Hello My CandyCane Children... Devil in my knees. Staggering step offs. Purple Visor. White Hat. Never know. Wheres my knee cap? Skateing across the field like a hockey puck. Blue glasses with orange light. Wouldn't do any good if worn at night. Every tendon on fire. Every nerve aflame. Trees as dark as a castle forest, but no castle. Only a hot black pool of melting lava. With white and orange lines. Trees so dark, it looks like they were bred from darkness. A long dusty yellow road right underneath with a king riding on a black stallion...and a queen in a beautiful black gown with lace and silver and blue and green. A brown haired princess on a black horse with a green and gold dress that matches her eyes. A group of golden knights, who have grown old, heavy, and overweight with the passing years of peace. And the ghosts, and souls od those who died in the tarpit. In their molton, tar covered deaths and doom. They hold becons of hope and light. Silver and gold becons that make light of the most beautious noise. But overhead, watching is someone of not very good intention. This army of one wishes to drain his slaves of life, so they become merely ghosts of their former selves. And the jester. The one who does not belong here at all. The one who doesn't fit in. The jester on the sideline in a cast. but this is no american pie. and the man who plays the drum. The one like a stick with pants like the sky and hair like the trees.  Well, he is think of another young man. A young man, who is indeed at the same time thinking of him. the touch, the feel, the soft lips and kiss like a fleeting spring breeze. he is think of this now and wondering why. But in his heart, he knows why. And take, for instance the boy he had the night I shall not name. He didn't love him... then why? This question can only be answered by the princess wondering that long, long yellow road. Not more than a mile from the tip of my very nose. She could answer the other boys burning question. She could tell him what he already does but does not know. And right now, the jester on the sideline in the cast. They do not desire to be here. Their world is that of vibrations, strings, wood, and ebony. But, what is this? Another jester? But no...Why? Hi, i'm nobody. Are you nobody too? The squawking of the crows. It fills my ears. I'm gonna try to stand. oops. better not. ouch. hands like lightning... with sticks and the beating of human remains. oop. the devil cam out of my knees... it climbed the mountain. it crawled into his eyes. It is infesting his very vision. and now his ears. Oh no- not his ears. oh of all the places to dweel, Lucifer! Why his ear? now we all die. and the boy with pants like the sky and hair like the trees. Still picturing the guy. Ohno! His eyes! He just killed one person! But not the jester! Not on the sidelines. No. Only on the pitch. Now another is KILLED. Because of his eyes.because of LUCIFER! In his iris and pupil and his whites. Everything. doom in every window and hell in one dark window Slight revival and the death of three. Somewhere in Charlotte, theres a street named after my sound. Massacre of sorts. ANd the boy who can still feel the other boys hands on his hips. sitting down.  suceed in ... death. Killed. No chance of trust or revival. getting up. NO! OW! Gently. two dogs are tearing their metal teeth into my tendons. Shit! The golden fat knights have whithered into the ground. But what do we have here? I think we have female warriors. True female warriors. Real, true, tough warriors. White a new thing. Bright white. Ivory killers. And flags.   ..::Reality::..

      Mood: ITS MY BIRTHDAY!! How the hell do you think I feel?... Crappy.. of course... ^_^ Music: "Hardest Button to Button" By... None other than!... The White Stripes Pondering: Who would want to hurt James Brown?  Hello My Candy Cane Children...  "There was a possibility, and it was retriever who discovered this, his wits got keen earlier and now he knows this and tells me to tell you.  When two or three are gathered in my name I am there with them, when two or three are gathered socially there becomes a new air in the room.  The fortunate ones aren’t given the chance to speak up, the losers are the ones who took the risk.  Words are thrown out and interpreted, jelly beans take on a whole different meaning to some, others attack back with awkward silence, but the perpetrator is definitely put in place by this.  So we now discover that socially retriever is at risk BUT KNOWS THIS, so how does he reply?  Now defensively acting (as he has been taught by his group to do)  he “waters down” his words, and tries not to “ruffle the feathers” of the city fathers.  Encounter ended, socially responsibility accomplished, egos stroked, he proceeds home.  Retriever you animal! how do you do it man? Does being good add anything to existing?  Do children cry for lack of more mature revenge? Does retriever bear a striking resemblance to a dog? All this and more discussed verbatim add nauseam  con frijoles, let’s look at it this way:  three people are sitting on a bench, one of them, let’s call her “amazing” says to one of the others, let’s call him “mr. Cotton”, “don’t you think that the sun burns beautifully?” and mr. Cotton replies (truthfully this time) “well amazing, is it not my right to deny the beauty of the sun, even when it shines in my face?, must I always agree with you for you are my mother?”  amazing replies, “it is impossible for mother and son to always have the same opinions, but until you are of an age when your experience proves you worthy, when I doth say the sun shines sweetly, thou must reply ‘as you see it mother, as you see it, it does!’” now there are no problems here so far, children will want their freedom, and will challenge the authority at times as their minds grow closer to maturity, this is not disputed.  But the third person had something interesting to say.  Her name was exemplify, and she was not happy at the state of the union.  She quietly spoke” don’t you both know that there are three truths?”  amazing and mr. Cotton said “no we have not heard of this.”  exemplify then states and I quote “one truth is what your own perception is, the other truth is what the collective perception is, and the third truth is THE truth, the only one that cannot bend and is constant for as long as the object, feeling, emotion, or instance lasts, this is the truth that only god knows, and that we only pretend to comprehend.” A silence fell on the other two, they had stopped twitching their legs on the bench, and the air was humid now, but pleasantly.  The bench was now a truth in three different ways.  Were they in line with the one true truth, or were their own perceptions being clouded by outside influence.  “Is it wrong to state anything at this point?” said mr. Cotton.  Bewildered. Mother knows best and calmed him with a stroke of her arm on his shoulder. They were in this together.  Exemplify laughed and slowly rose, the bench turned blood red and the beast within exemplify showed itself only for a second, the eyes turned white and the others looked as if they didn’t know what they saw what they saw what they saw, exemplify excused herself and walked off.  Mother and child did not mention to each other what they thought they saw.  Each one debating alone, afraid to bring to light what they may not have known to be true. Jack white III"  That was published in the "Message from the White Stripes" section of www.whitestripes.com  Its true, isn't it? But who's to say whats true, when there are 3 truths?  ~Exemplify laughed and slowly rose, the bench turned blood red and the beast within exemplify showed itself only for a second, the eyes turned white and the others looked as if they didn’t know what they saw what they saw what they saw, exemplify excused herself and walked off.~  ~I had opinions that didn't matter I had a brain that felt like pancake batter I got a backyard with nothing in it Except a dog, a stick, and a box with something in it."  .reality

      ::Music: "Time for me to Fly" by REO Speedwagon  " 'Maybe they didn't want us to find out about such a dangerous place,' Violet said, peering off the ledge, 'although, if you have to hide a headquarters, it's a beautiful place to do it. Aside from the remains of the fire, this is a very lovely veiw.'              'Very lovely indeed,' Quiggley said, but he was not looking at the veiw beneath him. He was looking beside him , where Violet Baudelaire was sitting."                                                                   ~ an excerpt from "The Slippery Slope" Book 10 in the Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.   *sigh* I wish... but no... I don't wish.. or do I? Do I wish to have that kind of love? Yes. But do I wish to have the pain that comes at the inevitable end? Yes. Too bad I seem to disgust every straight man who comes within 100 feet of me. Except for ones that Fate has decided to use to play a cruel game with my heart. And now, at this very moment, the cruel mistress known as Love has my heart in a strong hold and is wrenching it away from the pure, blissful pain of loneliness and is now placing it into a phase of tortuous, clouded want. Into the same tortuous clouded life that has greyed my life before and I bet will shadow it over yet again.   If you but knew How all my thoughts seemed filled with dreams of you how sometimes, in the silent night Your eyes thrill through me with their tender light How oft I hear your voice when other speak How you midst other forms I seek Oh, love more real than though these dreams were true If you but knew  ~I’ve been around for you I’ve been up and down for you But I just can’t get any relief I’ve swallowed my pride for you I’ve lived and lied for you But you still make me feel like a thief  You got me stealin’ your love away ’cause you never give it Peeling the years away And we can’t relive it I make you laugh And you make me cry I believe it’s time for me to fly~  .reality

      Listening to... "Meet Virginia" by Train   chp.25 gotcha   Who are this young couple that walk together up No-View Alley, hand in hand, completely unmindful of the whoosing wind and the flocculent snow? They appear to be old friends, or perhaps new lovers- interestingly enough, in the Lashasa Palulu language, the two terms are rather similar.     Newly fallen snow lies several inches deep on the rooftops and sidewalks and lawns, a glistening and pristine white carpet that muffles their footsteps and turns their conversation to whispers, so that it is hard to tell what they are talking about. I am quite sure they are speaking utter nonsense to each other, but they appear to be having a very good time.      They reach a house that looks like it needs to lean against the houses on either side of it for support against the wind. "Why don't you come in?" Violent Hayes offers. "I"m sure my parents have gone to bed by now. We could have some hot cider and watch TV in the basement." Violent Hayes, your eyes are gleaming in the moonlight.       Ah, the young fellow is tempted. But he has learned a thing or two in his brief life that is not a life. "I would love to," he says, "but it's late, and as you said yourself, it would be hard for the evening to have been more fun. So let's say goodbye now."       "Okay," she says. "Okay." She hesitates. The moon discreetly hides its face behind some clouds. "John, will you kiss me goodnight?"       "I'm not sure it's a good idea," I try to warn her. "I am a notorious nose biter. A lip nipper, and perhaps even a tongue chewer."        "Its a good idea," she says, closing her eyes and moving her head forward.        Violent Hayes, is this a kiss? It feels so soft and warm. I did not know that kisses came in this flavor. Ah, so this is why people like kissing. Now I see, now I see!        "Good night, Violet. Here's your brother's jacket back."        "Good night, John."  ~An excerpt from Chapter 25 of the novel "You Don't Know Me" by David Klass

      long black paint on my short finger nails.... big, pulsating lines of depth under the windows to my soul. Two of them.  And the candy cane children frolic among their many christmas presents like happy little truths right down to their very souls. and I sit here with long dark brown strands of truth covering my eyes for the first time in a while. but they don't cover my cheeks. Just my eyes. and I sit here typing my epistles to an apostle of satan and she does not want to read, but it is her job. and her duty to the dark king. and i feel unworthy, as I should, being simply a truth covered mound of skin, with peircing emeralds and sapphire sheilds. And the b of the erricy named my middle scyth on my left hand cum dumpster. And I named him ghiradelli. and we all lived happily ever after like the 3 truths, exempify, mr cotten, and amazing, but only exemplify has the monster of truth. And candy cane children will be candy cane love slaves. and I am looking at long tan ugly, unessecary things that sprout from the knot on either end of my arm, and they have black at the ends. and my eyebrows tell lies, and when on of a speicies loves, and conquers, and gives pleasure and desire to one of the same speicies, they are run out of town with pitchforks and tennis rackets. and they speak to me because I am no one. are you no one too? They'll banish us you know. how boring like a frog, to tell your name the live long day to an admiring bog....  and I passed up a chance to save the world today, but not to go get coffee with some murderers... and the world is going back to the way it once was, about 40 or 50 years ago, when your parents become children, and stop loving one another when the male speicies breaks the female's doll. And the beautiful people who only fuck the other beautiful people and then are run out and banished for it. And mine, we'll call him "Mr. Cotten" and my other, we'll call her "exemplify". they are going to be raped and killed, because they fuck the others. Exemplify fucks the truth, and Mr cotten fucks lies... but they are them selves. and never again will he be able to suck in the shining glory... the liquor that I"ve never gotten to taste, but would, most willingly. and in my mind i think like an impatient man with a remote control changing the channel every decond looking for a program that never existed.     shh.

Amazing he's a whole new form of life Blue eyes blazing and he's going to be my wife  Oh, shadows of echoes of memories  Oh, things that he brings that he found in the sea  Oh, shadows of echoes of memories of songs  Oh, how could he know that it won't be long... Grand pianos crash together when my boy walks down the street  There are whole new kinds of weather when he walks with his new beat  Everyone sings hallelujah when my boy walks down the street  Life just kind of dances through ya from your smile down to your feet         I think i love magnetic field.     its so strange when you are around these people, and you've always felt so, at home, with them... and you feel like they are your only friends because they surround you, but suddenly, you feel as though you don't belong. just... to many things that make you think that despite how nice these people are, and how sweet they are, and how much you love them, you just can't seem to connect with them in the ways that you used to. And it makes you want to shoot off your hands and drink from the spirting stumps.      doesn't it?    And today, I was called a lie in the hallway, and then i was called the truth in hell. and i just. don't. get. it. why me? but of course, everyone asks themselves these questions. and i'm just being a stupid little twat asking. Because i know. IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE! IT ALWAYS HAPPENS TO SOMEONE. ASKING 'WHY ME' IS JUST STUPID. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE ONE DAY, GOD TOOK HIS PHONE BOOK OF THE WORLD, AND SPUN AROUND REAL FAST AND CLOSED HIS EYES AND POINTED AT A NAME. AND GUESS WHAT? IT WAS YOURS. SO FUCK OFF AND GET USED TO IT.     please?     i don't think i've ever wanted to leave more than right now. I don't think i've ever hated charlotte more than right now. i don't think that the urge to leave has ever been stronger. the urge to get into a car, that i don't know how to drive, simply because no one ever taught me, and take off down the road that we never take in the morning. the less taken one. I seriously wonder how many times I would have missed school if i drove to school. because it looks so inviting to veer off into the other lane, and take off, and fight dragons, zombies, cults, and republicans on my life long adventure soaked drama journey.but no. I'm 14. Fuck my dreams. to hell.    i'm sick.   i'll tell satan you said hi.         ..redwhiteblackhomosexuality

      I was raped today   i hurt myself today.   hes a cool, blonde, schemeing trick. you want him so much you feel sick the boy can't help it.  he really can't help it now.  teenage brandos stalk him in the hall they tease him with cat calls.  hes a combination of tom cruise and zach o'toole. highschool, highschool confidential highschool, highschool confidential What that guy, doin with him? Its that guy, and hes screwin with him Can you smell the sex and sweat,  he'll make you cream your jeans  so you won't forget.    i was raped today and then the left my white knuckles still clutching the bedsheets. they could have left me at least a gun, or poison, or something, but no... they just left me. just me. all alone in a room with nothing but a bed, with bloody sheets, a shaved head, a composition book, and a window, through which the black sun streams. Had the moon been out there, this never would have happened. But who would have planned a night attack, when i am that much more vulnerable during the day? Why? they knew that. they came. and i heard, while the temple that is my body was desicrated, i heard a shreiking unlike any ever heard, and the night came faster than usual because the moon wanted to comfort me. that was her screaming. everyone heard it. even i, from the far side of the world. even you, on the dark side of nowhere. the moon healed my acheing wounds. She cleaned them, and let me bathe the filth off of me in her light. and why did they do this to me? Because i fuck truth. and lies. i fuck all of the three truths, and the only lie. like the lie that no one will ever read this. why would they? Its too far down. they only like to go half way down, just because down here is where i roll in the filth and the mud. where we fuck in the filth and the mud. where we pour it into ourselves and they expell it back out through a heinous complement or a quick fuck.  I'll get there first.      and I'll make sure to tell satan you said hi.     .redwhiteblackinsanity

      what have i become? My sweetest friend? Everyone you know goes away in the end. And there he is. the tin god of your life. and maybe he is as wonderful as you say. maybe i need to scrape the shit from my eyes. or start picking away at the brown coagulated and crusted blood that coats my eyelashes, and painfully open them to the light that i have never seen. once there was a girl who was asleep all her life. and then one day, she woke up. and now every second of every day, i want to cry. just cry for innocence. and then there are days when i get angry. and i talk to people. i talk, i laugh, i have good times. we bond, we get to know each other, and then i see her later. and when i see her, she very sweetly walks up to a boy with eyes of a tin god, and somehow, from across the room rips out my vocal cords, and then my eyes. and then, with all the sweetness of a saint, reaches to my breast, and pulls out my heart in a guilty lump, ties a little bow around it, and hands it back to me on a silver platter. and there he is, watching all this, just looking at me like a peice of shit not worthy of such kindness or generosity. and there i sit. and i cry. not for myself for i care not. i cry for a friend to strong and to loving and to sweet to deserve such, pain, and torture. and in the dark cave where my heart used to reside, they place a stone. and now i have a heart of stone. shes so not deserving of this. she deserves to be loved you INSUFFERABLE ASSHOLE! YOU NEED TO OPEN YOUR BLOOD CAKED EYES AND  SCRAPE AWAY YOUR HYPOCRASY AND REALIZE THAT SHE WORSHIPS. SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. SHE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANYONE HAS EVER LOVED YOU. PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYONE EVER WILL. SHE LOVES YOUR FORTES (of which her blindness of love has fooled her into thinking are many) SHE LOVES MORE YOU FLAWS. SHE YEARNS FOR YOU. A LONGING FULL OF DEEP, PENETRATING HURT. and i hate you for it. i hate more than anyone has ever hated you. probably more than anyone ever will.     wait. they don't love you like she loves you.                                                           i wanna die for her.

      I hunger like a killers wife. For love. For hate. For a cold fist against an even colder eye. and there i go. miles away. with the car, and the spider, my enemy. I am a man that makes the devil pale.  and i have a hook in my mouth pulling ever so slowly through my cheek. piercing the skin, a layer a second. and finally! it goes.  and i am pulled. but i don't move. and it tears at my fatty cheek skin. pulling pulling pulling snap. and it is out. It is out of my mouth, my cheek, my personal space, my doorway, my house, my block, my street, my neighboorhood, my city, my county, my region, my state, my time zone,my country, my hemisphere, my atmosphere,                                                                                     my life   goodbye

      "AY!" the crew shouted as they jumped to the decks.  "Get to work! Work hard! FAST!" shouted the intimidating captain. The salty wind blew the captains long black strands of hair across their face, as if momentarily gaurding the harsh beauty. The Captain walked along the deck of the boat to the main deck with their boots clicking, clacking, clicking with every step. The captain smiled a toothy smile revealing one gold wolffang tooth and the rest a creamy white, gleaming like the sun. "I Thought you could do better!" the dragon of the seas shouted to the crew, over the bustle and rustle of everyday life.      As the captain click clacked back around the hull of the ship, they were approached by a wirey little fellow, no more than 17.  The dragon peered down their nose at the inquisitor. "Uh.. c..c.ca.captain?" "Yes, what is it  boy? Speak up?" "thought you might.. c..care to kn..know that our watch out man has spotted white sails on the horizen. they're g..gaining speed." Cpt. Bellows' head sprang up. Bellows' eyes squinted and finally went back to their normal wide open green spectrums. "EVERYBODY! ALL HANDS ON DECK! PREPARE FOR BATTLE! ONCE THEY'RE DISARMED, WE BOARD!!!!!!!!!!" A cacophany of cheers went up from the  main deck as the men and women of the crew fell into battle positions.        The white sails on the horizen got larger, and larger, more white and blinding with every  pulse of the ocean beneath them, and the crew got more ready, and more ready, with every pulse of the ocean beneath them.

      hello there. the angel from my nightmare. the shadow in the background of the morgue. the unsuspecting victim. of darkness in the valley. we can live like jack and sally if we want. where you can always find me, and we'll have halloween on christmas, and in the night we'll wish this never ends. we'll wish this never ends.                                             i miss you                                                      i miss you                         Where are you and I'm so sorry. I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight. I need somebody and always. This sick strange darkness. Comes creeping on so haunting every time. And as I stared I counted Webs from all the spiders, Catching things and eating their insides. Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason. Will you come home and stop this pain tonight. Stop this pain tonight        don't waste your time on me you're already a voice inside my head.            i miss you i miss you.       je t'amie     if only you knew.

      I couldn't find any meaning in my life when I was out there. I'm sure as hell not going to find it in here. This is the grand finale of a life poorly spent and the end result is just overwhelmingly depressing ? it's just a sick, pathetic, wretched, miserable life story, that's all it is. How it can help anyone, I've no idea.    I don't even know if I have the capacity for normal emotions or not because I haven't cried for a long time. You just stifle them for so long that maybe you lose them, partially at least. I don't know.    That night in Ohio, that one impulsive night. Nothing's been normal since then. It taints your whole life. After it happened I thought that I'd just try to live as normally as possible and bury it, but things like that don't stay buried. I didn't think it would, but it does, it taints your whole life.         yeah... its where jesus died.

I like you with blood on your lips. i like you with grease in your hair.  i like you with your knife  and your dick and nothing to spare.  i like you with blood on your teeth. with death between your legs thrusting into the viscera and drinking straight out of the keg.  thinking all of your thoughts slicing one leg from the hip mixing your drinks of your coke and your barbituates   you fooled them into your room they wanted to leave  but they never will. you longed for someone to hold you close someone  cold someone pale  someone still.    Do you remeber stevie? do you remeber the feel of the serated edge of the knife, Jeffrey you made you first kill   Gulpping your whiskey again and killing again just for fun cutting and fucking and numbing again. time to run.   you fooled them into your room they wanted to leave  but they never will. you longed for someone to hold you close someone  cold someone pale  someone still.   Were you the conductor from hell Or were you the run away train? Maybe the only one who will know     is that puppy with a stick through his brain.   you fooled them into your room they wanted to leave  but they never will. you longed for someone to hold you close someone  cold someone pale  someone still.       jeffrey dahmer was attacked and killed in prison on nov 28 1994.  memento mori

      Yes. I know that Leviticus says that gay people are bad, yet only two pages back, it says that it is an abomination to eat lobster, shrimp... the same for pork. so your bible, the same one that says that gay people are bad, also says that the road to hell is paved with bacon.    lindsay was in the movie, and she was a lesbian there too.

And they want to cry for her, let her go... but they simply tie her to the bedpost.   soak my world in blood. a white child sits and listens to the sympathtetic sounds of childhood, wishing more than anything to be able to hear the sympathetic sounds of detroit. she looks at her paintings.. she looks at her life... she looks at herself. And she wants to cry for herself, let herself go... but she simply ties herself to the bedpost.      redwhiteblack.truthdoesn'tmakeanoise

      hm... maybe they were right.. I mean..I do wanna get free.    Thats 364 tears girl.  Was that her dad with a magic marker writing little angel on her head?   It was really late at night... and she was in one of her moods. She just kept bitching and bitching and bitching and bitching. I swear. It wouldn't have happened if she would have just shut the hell up. but she didn't. It got to be too much... so i reached out, and wrapped my hands around her throat.  I just held her there, and as her face was turning red, and her fingers were turning blue....i thought i heard her say something... Later, at the funeral, Father Solanus Casey,  stood at her head stone... and spoke of her, like a little angel. God. If he only knew. Her Preist, standing up there, telling us all what a little angel she was. No. I went back to that grave later. Just to make sure. Just to make sure that she was dead. And all I heard were her devils, so i walked away satisfied.   Chicago, 1997

No expression, No expression. Hide my head I want to drown my sorrows. No tomorrow, No tomorrow. And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad. These dreams in which i'm dying, Are the best I've ever had. I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take when people run in circles its a very very mad world, mad world. Children waiting for the day they feel good, happy Birthday, Happy Birthday. And i feel the way that every child should, sit and listen, Sit and listen. Went to school and I was very nervous, no one knew me, No one knew me. Hello teacher tell me whats my lesson,look right through me, look right through me.And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad. These dreams in which i'm dying, Are the best I've ever had.

         there would be headlines in the papers. Even the grown-up gangs who ran the betting at the all-in wrestling and the barrow-boys would hear with respect how Old Misery's house had been destroyed. Driven by the pure, simple, and altruistic ambition of fame for the gang, Blackie came back to where T stood in the shadow of Old Misery's wall.    T was giving orders with descision: it was as though this plan has been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his fifteenth year crystallized with the pain of puberty.    and destruction after all is a form of creation

      um...  yeah...    emily....  urlLink Lookie. Legolas is pretty. and sean astin makes me drool.     and uh... that song...  The Reason.... By hoobastank (youbastank you crapass band)  but it really seems like the type of song that would be for...like... if you were having a baby...  in certain situations. Yeah. like if you were a party person or if you were depressed or immature and you got pregnant... i mean...  okay. story time.   say that you were like.. a drug addict. and you got pregnant... and you decided to get clean.... after you had this child, because you loved it so much... but they were going to take it away from you until you got clean and were able to prove yourself responsible enough... like they do..  i mean. it fucking works.    Disco Bloodbath by james st. james is a nasty party monster hiding in the makeup waiting to pounce. and nefertiti is an LCK with a ferocious appetite for milk. they can suck so hard that they make your insides curl up. the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom i scream you scream we all scream for nonfat ricecicle tofugurt    maybe its you you know your eyes are awful blue maybe its more maybe your all i ever waited for  hey! you! The one with the awful ice blue eyes! Aemilius!!! At least thats your name in the feminine form. but answer me!  You! RIVAL!!!! Talk to me! You must come see my LCK! You must come see my LCK! You must come see my beautiful egyptian princess! You must come see my nefertiti! you must come see my LCK!  you must come see my neffey! But don't be to hard on her. shes little. but ferocious. as ferocious as a jungle tiger...   you must come see my LCK!     you must come see....     My little Calico Kitten.

      I saw the movie.    and i gotta say... They are perfect together. Despite the gag reflex that seized me at first.  seriously. With some colgate whitining toothpaste... fuck it... a bottle of clorox bleach on those teeth, and a razor to shave that little goatee of his face.... I could so see them doing it.   Well, I'm off to    There walks a lady we all know   talk to children    if you listen very hard   but no one knows how   but shes buying the stairway   but still i can try   to heaven.

      I feel like a fraud. I don't know if i can take this. I just... I don't want to be here. And now i sound like a stupid little angsty teenager.  I feel like a stupid little angsty teenager. We all will, in the end, become what we hate. I am what i hate. And i don't think i can deal with this. I always feel alone. I"m lonesome in the middle of a million. And no one know how to talk to children. and when christmas finally comes, and no ones got a gun.. and i think it might be fun to make a stand. I better think again man. and i just...  oh I don't know. It just always seems like I have to be different. And there is a way to be different.  To be always young. When you die young, you stay that way forever. and everyone talks about it... but no one actually goes through with it... or goes deep enough with it.  damn the elasticity of skin. And damn me. Damn it.    I'm a fraud, a poser, and just about the fakest person i know.

      I remember when i was just a  little boy i felt so free and easy, cuz life i did enjoy. it didn't take too long to show me i had been taught wrong. get in line you dreamers and lull a brand new song. all in time you'll be fine if you don't look around you. We have planned some shit for you to buy to keep you occupied. feeling nostalgic. lost my guitar. gone to have some more music put in it. I was running out.  and now i can't just stroke my lover's harmonious stomach, nor run my fingers along her dark toned neck. nor can i enjoy the fact that she is so hot, so temptuous, that when i am too long putting my fingers upon her, they sprout up in little white blisters, and my fingers turn red. oh how i miss my crimson haired tutor of love. how he spouted tantalizing poetry from the life lines of love. nostalgia is in the smell of pot. and the feel of peace. and the feelings of butterflies. I never knew what that smell was in his room until freshman year. Go figure. God. Mary. Joseph. Allah. Lilith. Adam. Eve. Ruth. Beatrice. HOW I MISS HIM! damn his fair maiden, Newy Ork        "Conan O'Brien never fails to make me crack up."   And it makes me wonder.
