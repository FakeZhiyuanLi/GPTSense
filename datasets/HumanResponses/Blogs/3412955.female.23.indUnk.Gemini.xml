      So, I can't believe I forgot to mention this yet, but I think I met the love of my life the other day. He came in to get travel shots, and I did not get the pleasure of administering them, another nurse snapped him up. However, I had to draw up some injections for someone else in the room he was in, and I heard him mention he was going to El Salvador to do construction. I asked him if he was going on a mission trip and he said "how'd you know??" and i said "i don't know, i just did." we had a moment. :) we made small-talk, but the clinic was busy and there wasn't time for a proper connection more than that one small moment. however, i have faith in moments. :) so let me just say....if anyone out there reading this blog is the love of my life who's going to el salvador...tarry no longer...hop on the white horse and come take me away!  i'm so glad it's a friday, and it's a 3 day weekend coming up. i have almost survived a week out of a nightmare (well, other than meeting my future husband, that is). i ate another apple this morning. i barely feel the effects. this saddens me! no, i do not fear the anti-aphrodisiac side effects of partaking in a pear, FOF...in fact, there is a reason i do not divulge in strawberries every morning. i simple have enough struggles without encouraging them!  i read a list of signs of job burn-out yesterday and i'm pretty sure i had all of them. i've begun to despise all people. this is another thing that saddens me.  i need rest. i know somehow it can be found in Him but lately everything runs together into tragedy. sometimes i wish to slide along the surface again. and deep down, the despair fades to trusting that everything will be ok, and on the outer edge, pain is only restlessness. so if you add it all together and divide by the music singing somwhere in the middle...the compartments of perspective seem so small and insignificant. this is what keeps me clinging to Him.  "he who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him." psalm 126:6

      Well, it's another working day, and an even earlier morning because I have to go get an allergy shot before work. I'm working on my 2nd cup of coffee, but I ate a pear this morning instead of an apple so I'm a little worried as to the consequence. I'm working in the STD clinic this AM, and i find myself with a sense of dread. yesterday some kid told me all the gory details of a recent sexual abuse. I sat there and I couldn't move. I'm not like some people who kick into high gear and think of all the legal things that need to be done. the girl's immediate safety was not in danger, and i found myself crumbling into her heart. when the doctor came in the girl touched me and said "please don't leave." everything inside of me bled. when she had gone and the legal process began, i closed myself into a room to make phone calls and the tears began. I stood there berating myself, thinking what's the matter with you...I am not a good professional...and then Jesus touched me and said He loved my heart and that I shouldn't be ashamed of it. I let myself cry for a minute. Sometimes I am so tired....but I know I have tried to be someone I am not...I've tried to be "strong" and deny who I am...but who I am is all wrapped up inside of Him...and maybe sometimes it's ok to care. As long as the protection of the Father doesn't let anything penetrate TOO deeply. The song "Shout to the Lord" gets me every time. I remember several months ago when going through a difficult time I was singing that song, and we got to the part where it says "my comfort, my shelter...tower of refuge and strength"...and the tears were just rolling down my face and i thought...what's the matter with you, and then I realized that it was joy because I'm so small and He's so Big, and what's the point of Him being so big if it's not that we're supposed to be small? And I saw who I was to Him for just a minute, and I wanted to be me even more. I love how He wants me to be me, even if it's not something others can totally respect all the time. and maybe it's just been Satan all this time, telling me that I don't love Jesus like I should, because right now I barely feel anything else but that love, and it seems to be the only thing that keeps me moving every day. maybe it's just a fear of feeling nothing else. i know everything else should explode out of that. but i've grown somewhat afraid of explosions. Just taking it a day at a time I guess. But I find myself more and more thinking that I should not deny who I am by going along with someone else's whims. This IS who I am...this desire for more than superficial dancing around deeper souls. We were created to fellowship with each other on a much more intense level than the occasional nod. Perhaps my job is just to be myself...to let the Father protect my heart instead of trying to keep it safe myself. It's cool sometimes to look at how things progress...from throwing my heart out with reckless abandon at every whim...to holding it back in selfish misery...to this somehow mysterious step of moving forward slowly with my heart in His hands. my favorite words: "everything will be ok" it's awesome to be grasshopper to such an All-Knowing, All-Protecting God who knows exactly who He died for me to be! well...I guess I must drag myself off to work...I have not yet figured out how to rejoice in this, though God is working on me and moments... there's a ground swell this morning, supposedly. Wish we were all out there worshiping on the waves! 'til then...  "Ask for love. Not just once. Over and over for the rest of your days, 'til your voice is hoarse, and with shriveled hand you point to your own aged heart and with one dying word whisper: 'more'." -beth moore ("when Godly people do unGodly things")

      This morning I woke up feeling a general sense of amusement. I have had my traditional 2 cups of coffee...my 2 cups of water...and this morning I added an apple because the rumor is it helps one to wake up, and sleep time was limited last night. i feel a sort of dried out, allergic-yet-awake feeling in my eyes...almost as if i had had a good cry last night, but i'll confess, i was too tired when i fell into bed even to make an attempt at crying. have you ever noticed that the amusement of a morning is always bitter? i mean, unless you're going to disney world or something...but if you've got work and you wake up laughing, it's probably one of those "surely getting up will kill me" kind of laughs. a dark morning humor. and today i'm stuck in the clinic all day, what fun, with the doctor who will be throwing temper tantrums because she wants to run everything.  it's summer, for heaven's sakes, i should be running and jumping and playing! I was a jerk last night...a spoiled brat...i do that all the time when i don't understand. sometimes what i think it is is either you throw your heart out there, you address the reality of a situation and do the right thing...and risk those looks of disgust, those feelings of smallness...or else you make the other person suffer too. and i'm just too tired to take risks anymore. you have to wonder when you're just being massochistic by being real when someone wants to avoid reality. but i don't know how to be any other way...and my feeling is maybe i just have to keep going this way and let God give me some thicker skin. but i think i need more time for that skin to grow, and meanwhile everything's all in my face. i don't ever know what to do except take all the blame on myself, forgive, and wait until everything explodes again.... but this system has a number of gliches, not the least being the 2 year old that comes out whenever all other methods have been exhausted. and the terribly dark and mean part of it is that there is some sense of satisfaction gained in knowing that if i have to get hurt over and over, there is at least some form of feminine retaliation which never fails. if i have to be upset, everyone should be upset until things get fixed. :) i don't understand friendship that lacks reality. what's the point? and if that's not what the other person wants, then WHY can't i just be ignored? there's no more lonely feeling than being with people who don't want you to know them... I want to BE...and i mean be- so much more than i am right now. are these moments of dullness some testing of character or am i settling when energy abounds, awaits my grasp. Where else would I go? this genuine wonder...there is nothing else. and though no real laughter frames the heaviness of a heart- a smile rests on the surface and slowly settles with a sigh inside of me, because it simply doesn't matter. it's not my fault that i don't feel. only that i must keep on moving.  "we have escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare; the snare has been broken and we have escaped." psalm 124:7

      I'm definitely going to need that fire today! Sometimes the absurdity of situations at my workplace almost overwhelm me to the point of hysteria. i often think if i don't giggle, i'll surely burst into tears. there is always so much conflict...so much "how can i take control?" and it amazes me, the stupidity, the arrogance. actually, what amazes me is the combination of stupidity and arrogance...because surely you'd have a right to be proud if you actually knew what you were talking about...but no one ever does. yesterday during a meeting that kept going around in circles and saying the same things....i very nearly couldn't stop the giggles, and i had to excuse myself to the bathroom. it's not my fault....other people make eye contact at the wrong moments.  it's all in the perspective, but i'm finding it hard this morning, because all i really wanted to do was stay in bed, all wrapped around my dog. but i knew i needed to put on my armor, so somehow i struggled up. the coffee was also an important ingredient. something i read today....dissatisfaction is opening up the door to seduction, because it becomes a stronghold. i want so much to be satisfied. but how does one go about this? we are given all that we need....every spiritual blessing...so why do i feel dry? how do i conjure up a feeling? and if it has nothing to do with feeling, then how can my relationship with Him be passionate? these things baffle me. but i just keep getting up because i know it's what He wants me to do. maybe this is all just a lesson in obedience, and i'm not doing such a poor job after all. some days it's all fetch and no pats on the head! but maybe the little things are enough: "Cosette Rainbow"- my rainbow. God gave her to me a year ago. she's just a dog, but do you know? she's also a promise. a promise that He cares about even the little things. that He picked out a dog that loves me more than anything has ever loved me. and if he cares enough to give me hugs every day through a mangy mutt...well then, i guess maybe that's enough. no...i mean, i know that's enough. I lay here at His feet knowing that this crushed position is where I am most valuable to Him, so why do i not feel victorious? His will is not blind stumbling, but one of abundance, peace, JOY that overflows. and yet i feel....awkward...i used to be real.  "simon, simon, satan has asked to sift you as wheat. but I have prayed for you simon, that your faith may not fail." luke 22:31

      A new day and even a new year...a birthday monday. how depressingly appropriate. :) created in the image of Being that longs for depth and wastes no time with skirting around the surface. i wonder if those who do not ache so deeply in loneliness as i do, and have not so persistently sought some form of satiety- ever know this overwhelming moment of being FILLED? deeply afraid to be broken, but longing for it in a gentle sort of way. sometimes i feel like a wild animal...eyes darting backwards and sideways, looking for the next attack. i don't want to see the look on His face, when i hand Him my mangled heart and see the sorrow in His eyes at the condition of something so precious. but maybe in its raw condition...in its sensitivity, it is that much more beautiful. here on the edge i stand, waiting for some awesome moment of revelation, when all along He stands there, hands out, waiting for me to let go. though wisdom screams "this makes you stronger"...something small inside of me hides. and i know He loves that something small, but i hate the ways it hurts me. i want to be strong and wise, but i am shrinking. fear has kept Him at an arm's length...just far enough to watch closely- right hand free to defend myself, should His love suddenly turn to anger. and i know now that He must love me, because He wanted me to know Him in such a way that He allowed me to feel what He must have felt. the shrinking sadness that comes from seeing how others' anger feeds off of vulnerability...even chosen vulnerability. so the song goes "i have felt the same as you...."  "in his arrogance, the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises." psalm 10:2  "for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknessess, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are- yet was without sin." hebrews 4:15

      I took the day off today as "mental health" day devoted entirely to finding my heart inside of God again. lately my heart has been crumbling around me....a feeling i've managed to stave off for at least a year by simply denying feeling at all. this is a mystery to me. for what relationship can thrive on carefully locked desire? yet...so often i think we Christians miss the mark here...so busy trying to say "your will not mine..." that we forget to "cast our cares upon Him." the way i do this is simply pretending i have no cares. it's funny how we can deceive ourselves in such a cunning fashion. i'd almost be impressed with my own guile if it wasn't for the reciprocating gullibility. come to find out, for all the sins i have loaded on His back and given for forgiveness...for all the rebelliousness i've renounced and freely handed over...even with the freedom nipping at my heels....i've forgotten what is equally important: the excrutiatingly painful losses i've experienced...some as a result of my own action...and some while i crouched and covered my face..unsure as to the fury and why exactly i was the target of such wrath. and all along these hurts have kept everything at an arm's length...polite and proper but never intimate...and even now i find myself afraid. won't He hurt me? won't He turn suddenly on me? i know the look- the anger and disgust that feeds off of the fear in my eyes. these are things i have learned, and i don't know how to un-learn them. begging Him not to go, then cringing when he touches me. i hate this fear inside of me that keeps me from being whole. all of these things i let inside that weren't Him....they mangled me into complete submission to my fear. i wanted to show him my heart, so i sat down at the piano, because it was the best i knew how. when i finished, i found myself wondering: was it something He could love? the dissonance so striking, and the sometimes painful intonation moving me inside. did it move Him? is He stirred by my harmonies? and when my fingers dance so lightly, does He strain? does He lean forward in anticipation of a heart's swell? does He hunger for my beauty, my music....my heart? i need to know. He moves me.

      So, it's already wednesday, I sort of can't believe it...and would you believe THIS? it's already the last day of june! The summer is half over...which might cause me to shudder if it wasn't for the fact that nothing is different over the summer anyway, so it might as well be autumn, you know what I'm saying? but i suppose i could be gracious to those who get a break and wish for a slowing of time...i think not.  yesterday, in my quiet ponderings as i dashed about at work...i began to think about my own issues with guilt. i have the rather frustrating urgency to always pay penance for even the slightest of infractions. i think this is why i thrive on conflict. it seems that in just about every human relationship, given our felshly natures...there is almost always various scrapings of irritation. from God, i am more than happy to accept grace. though i cannot understand the concept, His word says that he has thrown my sins far from me upon confession, and that He sees me as pure and holy. i used to have trouble even accepting this grace because it is so inhuman, but i have over time found a little more ease in this. i have not, however, learned very well to accept grace from other humans. i prefer justice. i used to see this as something of a weakness, but yesterday, pondering these things while i pretended to be working...it dawned upon me that maybe this is logical. after all, though filled with the Spirit, other people are very human. and the truth is...i haven't known many people who just pick up in forgiveness without seeing justice done. i think people pretend a whole lot...but i know that even i...a "most forgiving woman" ;), have the tendency to forgive very nicely until it happens again, and suddenly i am doubly agitated because... it has happened again! this troubles me. i think sometimes "forgiveness" is just a passive way of avoiding conflict and not addressing issues that need to be addressed. i have a tendency to want to address things down to the last detail...pound it out, get everything out in the open, even fight a little if that's what it takes to clear the air. because i've just seen so many things fester when they're kept inside. i have a feeling this is sometimes agitating to other people. but it's how it has to be for me, and there is something secure in knowing that i always know where i stand with someone. sometimes, i don't even mind groveling a little bit, because i feel that i'm doing penance...and it usually makes the other person feel better too, so why not? why not just address things as you go instead of letting everything build to terrifying proportions?  an excellent demonstration of one who always demands justice and always forgives fully after it's been administered...we'll just call him N. a couple months ago, i began to have some guilt issues about something i had done in the past to this guy...because i had just repeated it...so i brought it up. he said "huh? i don't remember that." i said "sure you do, you were furious...etc. etc. etc." he said "don't be silly. i don't remember at all." i described the scenario, and all of a sudden he was laughing and said "sure...i remember kicking your butt hard for something...i remember how cute you were apologizing. but i had forgotten what i was mad about. i told you i forgave you...doesn't that mean forgetting too?" immediate justice is so much more liberating.  live exuberantly, lament fiercely...you may have figured it out, but i'm still studying David, and this was a quote from the book I am reading today. of course, i was quite pleased to read that my natural tendencies are actually quite spiritually healthy...that God gives us extremes of feeling to embrace and not restrain. of course...they're to be brought immediately to Him and turned to poetry in His heart rather than festering away inside of our souls...but if you think about it...repression is just another way of embracing grief...because it just means we're holding on to it so tightly we don't even want God to see! last night, taking a walk, i found myself grieving. grieving circumstances i just can't understand. taking a walk i was remembering past times of fun, past times of intimacy...a HISTORY of friendship. i don't grieve for the friendship i have had the past several months. that has not been friendship, and it has not been with someone i loved. instead, i grieved for who this person used to be. i got to the beach and i found myself dissolving into tears there on the stairs. because i know that this is out of my hands...and of course i know that this will be turned to something beautiful...that my Father has it. and that He has me. i know it is not something that i need or ever needed...it is only that...i have a hard time with unresolved issues. i feel a burning need to make things right. but there comes a time when we've done all the reaching we can do, and we just have to walk away. i hate giving up.  "pain isn't the worst thing. being hated isn't the worst thing. being separated from the one you love isn't the worst thing. the worst thing is trivializing the honorable, desecrating the sacred." -eugene peterson

      It is only 11 am, and already...what a day! I arrived at work this morning to find a note on my desk which said "Joelle, please cover triage today". I was absolutely delighted! I much prefer giving shots, pregnancy tests, diabetic supplies, epilepsy meds, etc. etc. to talking to people about their sex lives. I was a little dissapointed to note that I had been assigned to lunch coverage (triage during the lunch hour), because I ate a big breakfast this AM, and now I'm not hungry! However, I bundled my things away and holed up in a room and waited for the onslaught. It came steadily, and I felt a flow and things were fine. Then one of the techs came racing up with wild eyes asking me if I was supposed to be in the STD clinic. I showed her the note, defensively, and praying that I could stay where I was. I continued giving shots. A few minutes later, my supervisor knocked on the door and asked that when I was done, could I go help the clinic...the nurses were drowning. I think everyone has started to think of me as the go-to man...the secretaries are always very surprised because you never know where I'll be from one moment to the next. I guess it is just because I'm young and quick. Anyway...so there were 10 charts waiting for me and I busied myself with them trying to have a good attitude. At about 10 until 11, I notified one of the nurses that I would soon be leaving for my lunch. She flipped out and said "there's no way you're leaving us!" and ran and got the supervisor. It was discussed, there was no way around me leaving...and I walked out of there relieved. :) This afternoon I will be in a satellite clinic so I'll be out of the drama at last... One good thing is, even with all my work...I am very appreciated there and I appreciate that. They shower me with praise and affection all day. The other day i made a sarcastic comment to one of my buddies (all of them old enough to be my mother, and they don't forget it)...and she said "come here, i'm going to whip your butt and make you work for once." JUST then, our supervisor came around the corner and said "you'll have to get through me first! she's just a baby!" hehe, i like being a baby. :)  anyway, i'm going to be a late baby, and i don't think i'd be so cute then... later.

      What seems to be the cool thing about all of creation except for man is that simply by acting on instinct, the intrinsic knowledge that they are...for example...a dog, or a horse...they are glorifying God. Here's Cosette, just here at my feet chewing on a knuckle bone, and I think...that's all she has to be, and it didn't take her any thinking to be it...it is just who she knows she is. I wonder if maybe we stopped forcing things all around us, it would be the same for humans too. we're too analytical for our own good. maybe instead of thinking about living all the time...we should just live. today i wish that who i was was not a nurse. :) today is going to be a horrible STD day with 2 nurses working in the clinic and 30 patients glowering in the waiting room and making comments like: "gosh...could they move any slower? they really take their time around here, don't they?", meanwhile i feel like i'm experiencing some sort of cortisol reaction because there are 10 charts sitting in the rack, and those darn techs keep bringing more...and when you're working on one, the doctor is bound to give you another one, wanting you to give them pills, and then the front desk will probably call you up to tell you there's a problem at the pharmacy, and would you call and clear it up? yesterday when i looked at the clock at 11:45 and saw that we still had 5 patients left, i looked at the doctor, and i considered what would happen if i knocked him in the back of the head and said: "do you have a fast forward button?" he acts like he has time to whistle in between. i have had a good week though, energy-wise, even though #1, it's that horrible time of the month, and #2 i haven't been getting much sleep due to tech week. i was thinking though...maybe i feel so good because music is one of those things i was just made to do, that i don't even have to think about, that i would never consider work. even if it's 3rd trumpet...i don't get the massochistic thrill of a raw mouth (incidentally, the Big N announced to everyone the other day that i have iron chops...and being a girl, i didn't find it flattering :))...but it's still good times. and i'm probably the best third trumpet ever...and i do mean ever. ;) well, gotta run, time's a-wasting. i'll check you dudes later...until then...

      How true is that...last week, the pediatrician at work asked me why I worked there. She said while I was young and had energy I should be making as much money as I could. I wondered where she heard that I had energy. People always assume that just because you're a kid you must be boundless. And what I've found is...physically I have all the energy in the world...but mentally I am completely limited. I just keep wondering when everything will at least sort of make sense again. Why is everything such a mess? I keep looking for a way to blame myself...and I know I've made mistakes, but they don't seem like they could possibly have caused such a landslide of confusion. Lately, I just keep asking Jesus to come back for us and take us home because I want to be His bride...I want Him to come back for me. This earth is so trying.      Last night was our first rehearsal, and, as fingers of fury stated, we were having some tempo problems. It amuses me also to see the Big N lose his temper...probably just because he has no real authority anymore. And also just because I am usually amused to see anyone lose their temper. It is something evil inside of me I suppose. But anyway, it's sometimes just a show that I am amused by it...because in the safety of distance, I am often quite quick to roll my eyes, but in the dead of the situation, I am occasionally scared out of my wits. Take, for instance, the situation with this current band director who called me with an agenda, which was mostly to let me know that I didn't REALLY get away with showing up late to rehearsal because there were good waves...but under the pretense of wanting me to lead the trumpets while playing third part. something i consider to be an impossibility, not to mention disrespectful to the guy playing lead. even if he is 15. so, since that conversation i have convinced myself in staunch rebellion that i will do nothing of the sort...but you wouldn't have known it when we were talking...because as soon as he said "stop making excuses and listen to me..." and as soon as his threats were voiced...i was like a little kid, and i even said "yes, sir." because i don't mess with his threats. i've learned from experience that they're real! so even though i pretend to be pretty cool, i think i'm pretty much as big a baby as anyone. one thing i was thinking during the show was this...why am i attracted to guys like this? the lead character is like every guy i've ever thought was completely adorable. a total JERK. and yet, i never learn. because even sitting there watching it, i thought..."aww, how cute", and i loved him. i am a pathetic loser. well, anyway, i have to get back to work. i have lunch coverage giving shots today. i hope the little brats stay home. gateway is going to be wild...they've taken one of our rooms and we have 29 patients scheduled...may God help us...or at least give us peace during the storm!

      So here I am, it's a Monday and I'm just lazing around the house without a care in the world. This is my summer vacation so I am taking full advantage of it. Actually, being out for 4 days of work...this is the longest vacation I've had since I can remember, and I've almost started to forget what work feels like! Hopefully I will return refreshed and not depressed...  The only obligation I've had today was to take my dog to the vet. There she was pronounced a "perfect specimen", but I think she almost had a heart attack on the table. I almost had a heart attack when I wrote a check for $184. I'm figuring though, it looks like she's going to be the only family i'm responsible for for a while, so I guess i may as well go all out.  since i had the day off today, there are no waves at all. nothing rideable. I am thanking God even in that though, because I know there must be other things He has for me to do, and I probably wouldn't have spent quite the amount of time in focused prayer if there had been waves. Friday I rode the longest and best wave I have ever ridden in my entire life. I still feel giddy from it. I feel like I'm finally getting the feel of my shortboard and the wave break, and I'm finally getting opportunity to steer up and down. Sometimes I get all giggly just thinking about it. "Righteous", would be the most appropriate word. I almost yelled it when I was cruising along but instead all I could muster was some sort of strange whooping sound.  In my quiet time today, I read a verse: "The Lord gives sight to the blind, The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous." psalm 146:8 I began to long with all of my heart to be righteous. I wondered what righteous meant fully. I began to search around in my bible. In the study bible, I found a definition of righteous that hit a very important chord inside of me and caused me to stop in my tracks. Righteous: "those who honor God and order their lives in all things according to His will. In every human relationship, they faithfully fulfill the obligation the relationship entails, remembering that power and authority are to be used to bless, not exploit." When you think of the word righteous, the immediate implication is solitary...a quiet blameless life. Between you and God. It is so easy to forget sometimes how our relationships with others, especially our brothers and sisters, are as much a responsibility as DOING things. I want so much to faithfully fulfill my obligations. It's just so easy to get confused. Today the story of David and Nabal (also known as the story of David and Abigail, as her beauty was instrumental in preventing disaster!). All this time I've been studying David's Godly reaction to Saul...his recognizing God's annointing even in the man who was bent on taking his life. David's character, his passion and his heart...his recognition of God's beauty have been of high importance up until this moment. But in today's lesson, this was when I realized how close to David I truly am. Because in today's lesson...David threw a temper tantrum. He reached out in love and asked for a favor from the man Nabal whom he had been protecting out of the goodness in his heart. When his humble request was met with arrogant denial, David...the same David who bowed to his king Saul instead of exacting revenge...gathered his men and set out to kill. Luckily for him, Nabal's wife Abigail heard what had happened and met David on his way to murder. There she humbly gave him everything he had asked for, and in an eloquent speech, reminded David of his righteousness and asked him to allow God to take revenge instead of taking it upon himself and later regretting it. David saw beauty and his heart melted. Thank goodness for beauty. Thank goodness for the beauty of other people, the beauty in the ocean..because they remind us that we too are beautiful. And then the anger drains...the "righteous" indignation drains, and the Nabals of the world become so small. I'm not sure how I've slowly reached this point of being one who has to constantly have her own way. I guess it's sort of a learned behavior. I've learned to get what I want. When I was younger, I humbly accepted the short end of the stick...I took ridicule and rejection softly...I crept away hurt but without guilty conscience. Somewhere over the years I've learned how to get what I want, and how to resent anyone who gets in the way of that. I guess we all get that way. But it's hard for me to understand how, like David, I can go so long in gentleness, in humility, in taking a beating without fighting back...and then one tiny thing can set off a landslide of anger and revenge. I guess it's because the gentleness is simply not me. It's only when I rely on God that the inner beauty comes out. It's so hard to remember. It's so hard to allow hurt to go unpunished. But somehow, I guess that's where trust comes in. He "frustrates the way of the wicked." They won't get away with it. I pray so much that I won't give in to the same attitudes of the world. I want so much for my gentleness to be known to all...I hate my depraved state. But I plan to carry this verse around with me...the words of Abigail, the reminder of beauty:  "Please forgive your servant's offense, for the Lord will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the Lord's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live." 1 Samuel 25:28

      I read yesterday that the right hand is where our defender stands. I think that's awesome. My bodyguard is all hanging out on my right side. I feel pretty tough. :) So, I haven't written in a week. I haven't had much interesting to say, it seems, plus i get up late and then I don't have time. I mean, it's God time or blog time and the choice is pretty obvious... I had an interesting revelation this morning that made me feel pretty excited. Maybe even elated, it made me feel as if a burden had been lifted. I was reading about David's relationship with Saul...how he was once loved and then Saul turned on him suddenly and began attacking everything about him. And as I read about David's approach to this enmity, suddenly very many things began to become clear, and I realized that who I have been greatly pursuing in friendship is actually who I should be treating as an enemy. The cool thing about being a Christian is that the way you treat an enemy is with great love. But it is a different kind of love from friendship, and you don't tangle yourself up and make yourself vulnerable to an enemy. Instead, you keep a safe distance...keep yourself from harm while never dreaming of harming the other. David...a man after God's own heart....how he must have been surprised and hurt by Saul's sudden anger with the boy he had once claimed to love. David was a sensitive spirit, this is so obvious in his writing...David, next to Jesus, my favorite man in the bible because of his intense passion....he must have been so taken aback by the anger. That's how I sometimes feel. I know I have not been perfect, I have made mistakes often, most often in reaction to hurt that I didn't understand. This I pray every day will not repeat itself...that only gentleness will come from my soul. But so often I have been only surprised and hurt by the hatred that seems to come so glaringly from who I once termed as friend. The sudden turning...the scorn...it's happened off and on from the beginning. But as David and Jonathon, i have him the benefit of the doubt. He has so many struggles, he must not mean to come off this way. But as time goes on, there comes a point when you must admit to yourself that sometimes people DO want to hurt you...for whatever reason it is. If we're in constant association with those concerned only with the surface...we inwardly become less. I have been allowing hatred to enter my soul by calling it friendship. Now I realize, these are pretty dramatic statements. And there is a fundamental difference, because this "Saul" has God's Spirit, God's annointing, and God has begun a good work in him that he WILL finish. I will not give up praying for this work, nor believe that he will never change. It is only that now, I have realized...the time has come to love as one loves an enemy...instead of the soul bearing love of a friend. This saddens me. And yet....my heart sings as if a heavy burden has been lifted. And I must give an apology to my Jonathons...whom I have not appreciated nearly enough...that I have give much more of my heart pursuing friendship with one who has no such interest.  "The greatest thing any person can do for another is to confirm the deepest thing in him, in her- to take the time and have the discernment to see what's most deeply there, most fully that person, and then confirm it by recognizing it and encouraging it." -Eugene Peterson.

      they say a truly good player plays 2nd or 3rd part with every bit as much heart as the lead. but i never claimed to be a truly good player! in fact...i have begun to wonder whether i would just rather not play at all if it's not lead part. :) this may sound like a really spoiled opinion but i guess it's just...high notes are my THING...the gutter...i can't put all that much passion into it. and plus, i've never been good at counting rests. you have to be good at counting rests if you're last chair. last night i began to wonder...if i never came in at all, would it even be noticed? i am now trying to devise something to suddenly come up before our last rehearsal (of course i have to go to tech week, but the tuesday rehearsal...i doubt my part would be missed!) anyway...so i guess this is yet another lesson in humility...but it seems my life is so full of these lessons. once in a while, it would be good to have a boost...other than at my job, because i'm tired of my job. that's a bad attitude. we should make the most of every moment, and i want to live today to the full...but it's so hard when you just keep wishing the work day was over...  "there's 24 reasons to admit that i'm wrong...and all my excuses still 24 strong...but i'm not copping out."  you'll never catch me copping out...unless i'm trying to prove something to somebody. ;)  "let your gentleness be evident to all.

      so, this past week i have been abstaining from secular entertainment of all kinds (which basically means, no tv or movies and listening to one CD over and over in the car...). The purpose of this was to protect myself from the constant bombardment of worldly lies that come from these forms of entertainment. particularly in the sexual arena. the idea was to fill myself with GOD'S views for a while so that i would not be so affected by the outside world. however...the unfortunate thing about my job is that most days i'm listening to people tell me about their 20 different sexual partners and exactly WHAT kind of intercourse they've had...so there's no getting away from it. so much for that.  i keep waiting for this moment where everything sort of clicks back into place and i'm not so squirmy and uncomfortable inside of me own skin.  the dimly lit room strikes a chord in the distance reminiscent of evening- then shudders to think it is only just begun. where is that child-like wonderment of the possibilities surrounding a new day? the sun rises, peeking hopefully between the clouds...wanting to see a smile on my face instead of a scowl. but i wonder- does the day interpret wisely my expression- or project all of its deepest fears onto the shadows of my face, absorbing only disgust? from my smallest moments, the memories are of pervasive fear. corrupted from childhood by the inside and the outside.  "I have chosen the way of truth; I have set my heart on your laws." psalm 119:30

      so yesterday morning i awoke with every tell-tale sign of a UTI. and if you've never had a UTI, it's probably because i had one for you because it has become routine. after a discussion with the MD on call, a one-dose poison was issued. i took it nervously, awaiting impending nausea but wanting anything other than the thinly stretched burn. then i thought...this is a piece of cake, and went to bed. however, my first assumption had been correct (where there's a will there's an A says 'always go with your first assumption', but it seems i only remember that after my second one has proven false.) it was not, in fact, cake...it was actually poison. i was up until 3 am, even after taking a benadryl, hoping it would knock me out. i rolled and kicked and pushed the covers to no avail. and i awoke this morning still feeling like i'm going to pop. but at least the UTI is gone...you can't have everything, you know. i feel annoyed with the world. depth of thought annoys me because it feels contrived...depth of feeling is irritating because it is so uncontrolled...and humor isn't all that funny because it's all been said before. so when someone tries to be funny, i just get irritated because i'm like..."that joke was so last week..." lately...since everything noisy or busy annoys me, i feel sort of snobbish. i feel like sticking my nose in the air and retreating. but i don't want to be alone...i just want to not feel annoyed. sometimes i just wish people would use less words because they start to jumble around in my head and confuse me. maybe i've just grown stupid. this is possible.  i'm not crying anymore, i'm just bored. i feel like i've been living the same day over and over again...and even the same dramas just keep repeating themselves and nothing ever moves forward. it's not like i'm at a standstill...it's more like i'm moving and moving and never getting anywhere. i feel like throwing a fit, only that would make me tired...and picking up the pieces would make me even more tired. so i just sit here, wishing i could live today. tomorrow i'll probably feel good, but who knows if anything will ever change. sometimes i just feel so out of place. everywhere. living on the surface frustrates me, but living on the spiritual side makes me feel disconnected. this should not be. how many things can i try to correct before the fruits are made real in me...instead of all this frustration? "yet i am always with you. you hold me by my right hand, you guide me with my counsel, and afterwards you will take me into glory. whom have i in heaven but you? and earth has nothing i desire besides you. my flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." psalm 73:something

      Just a quickie because I have to go get my allergy shot. Only one more day this week, I think I can survive it. plus we have an inservice this afternoon so that means an afternoon nap....though it's on pediatric records, so i'll probably get blasted...no worries. last night as i was praying and such, i began to feel a sense of urgency, as if there simply wasn't enough time for everything. i'm going to haiti in october and we have multiple meetings and homework assignments, the music minister committee is in full-swing and i agreed to make a bulletin board, now i've decided to start a girls' bible study...i'm playing in summer fine arts, there are so many things that need to be done around the house...there simply isn't enough time in the day. and it's not that i don't feel called to do every single one of those things, that's what's funny..i felt specifically called to all of them...but then again, i guess that's reassuring because that means God will give me the strength to do them. the thing is though, i think we get such a sense of "that should have been done, like, yesterday" that we panic ourselves and God says...chill out...I've got it. it's nice to know. maybe i won't meet the deadlines the way everyone wants exactly...as long as i'm obeying God every moment things will get done in his time. I feel that way about work too...so much pressure is put on me by other people...but i can only do so much, and only what God tells me. well, i have so much more to write, but i've got to get to the doctor... "am i now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? or am i trying to please men. if i were still trying to please men, i would not be a servant of Christ." galatians 1:10

      First of all, let me start out by saying "yay!"...that's just all i have to say about a morning when i jumped eagerly out of bed for the first time since i can remember...for a morning when everything didn't hurt, when my heart feels light...when hope feels right around the corner, and my moments with Jesus like a very refreshing drink i pray i can hold on to! perhaps i have been denying myself this abundance, this joy and hope by simply holding on to my pride of not needing help. i figured God could work miracles...but you know what...God works miracles healing cancer patients with chemotherapy, and i don't see where there's much of a difference. and if this enables me to serve Him better..well then, i don't guess i should feel guilty about it! God's provision comes in so many different forms...what a gracious God. and God's provision in an opportunity to serve! oh I cannot express the joy i feel in finding a place to unload my passion for Him and use the experiences i have had to point them to Him.  socially, i have just been so off for such a long time...i could barely even recognize it until it was gone...some still remains...but the overstimulation, fear of noise and chaos, extreme sensitivity to rejection. i can feel it sliding away. maybe it wasn't me. maybe i don't have to be afraid.  now i only hope this joy will last me through the day...so tiring and stressful. yesterday, the new girl said "oh my gosh, i think i've heard your name almost 300 times today...i'm starting to hate it." and i said "trust me, i'm starting to hate it too!" over the intercom....yelled down the hall from the doctor or a tech or someone...everyone wants me to solve their 20 problems all at once. i pray for God's strength and rest and peace today.  "To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassing great revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me." 2 corinthians 12:7  "He reached down from on high and took hold of me; He drew me out of the deep waters. He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes who were too strong for me. They confronted me on my day of disaster, but the Lord was my support. He brought me out into a spacious place; He rescued me because He delighted in me." psalm 18:16-19  Live like He's delighted in you today, because He is!

      Another week begun, thankfully a short one. i am impressed that i was able to get out of bed this morning. my dog did not move at my feet. i think sometimes she hopes if she is perfectly still i will just decide not to get up. sometimes i wonder why i keep getting up in the mornings, but i think i just know i'm supposed to. and maybe it's ok. yesterday i read somewhere that sometimes you can't help how you feel, but you can help how you THINK, so you just have to harness what you can. in some ways, i buy it. in others, i think...if you're a little loopy, it's not just your feelings that get off, your whole mind starts processes that are barely intelligible. i'm ok though, that's what's so weird about it all. my heart feels heavy inside of my chest...like it's breaking all the way through and coming out of my throat in some form of explosion...only it's a quiet kind of explosion. and i don't feel panicked. everything hurts though. my whole body hurts to the touch.  i watched the sixth sense last night, and i always feel a certain kind of comfort from the look in the boy's eyes because i think it's good to know someone else understands what it's like to be haunted. because sometimes that's what i think it is...not to sound creepy or anything, but i often wonder if this sort of problem i deal with is only a heightened sensitivity to a spiritual world that most people don't even recognize. demons, angels, the spiritual realm is very very real to me and heavy in the air around me. maybe i am not ill, only perceptive...and it can be somewhat tiring. it means only that i need to rely on the Father that much more because the seduction is thick. and in my weakness i am a prime target. perhaps there is such a thing as living victoriously. even in the heaviness of heart i feel a hope tugging. yesterday a moment of victory. i woke up feeling completely agitated...almost out of control. i began to feel afraid, i didn't understand the anger. but i knew i didn't want it. that kind of anger hurts...i mean, all the way through, it makes you sick...trust me, i know. i didn't want it but i felt powerless against it. i felt myself spinning more and more out of control...i felt like pacing the floors. i got up and prayed. i prayed the hate because i didn't know what else to do. i prayed the hurt that i thought i gave up a long time ago. and then, as i prayed for a heart change, i felt myself start to love. i felt myself seeing things for how they really are, and i wasn't a victim anymore. satan thrives on victims because we're so open to anger. some scars never go away, and i feel sure there is a reason for that. but the weakness in those areas are a prime target. i hate when i don't feel good enough. the scorn and contempt of others...the resentment of my vulnerability...these things break my heart. i'm not going to ever pretend again that i'm not open to that kind of attack. i am. i'm sensitive. but that doesn't mean i have to be controlled. i think maybe it's ok. in learning to love myself, i've had to see myself as God sees me. in learning to love others, i have to do the same. i hope we all can love the Spirit inside of each other today.  "now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to the power at work within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever! Amen." ephesians 3:20

      Lately, I have been wanting quiet, wanting to be alone or at least in quiet companionship. I have an urgent need for stillness in my soul so I keep returning to the solace of privacy where it is only me and my Father, who strengthens me. I find myself in constant weariness, and constant need of a refuel...  Last night, I took a walk, hoping for something quiet to spring up and stop the swirl of thoughts that are always going. I'm always trying to work things out, to scheme until things settle in my mind instead of just living and letting go...Sometimes, in the movement of a walk, only the consistent rhythm of feet tapping the pavement meets the mind. Sometimes the blood runs out and into the unmental muscles and allows for retreat inside the solace of space.  On this walk, I found the creeping insistency of thought would not slow, and in frustration I kept trying to redirect...kept praying for focus on only higher things- it wouldn't come. And then- Cosette interrupted the regularity of footfall. My first instinct was frustration, but as I watched her sniff around, I found my body relaxing and realized it was ok to stop moving.  And in that moment, my eyes came to rest on something small. You know sometimes you catch a smell of something familiar, or the sound of voices past- and all of a sudden the identity you've worked so hard to create has changed, and you remember things long forgotten? Surely you've seen these "flowers"- they're tiny with brown center and little white leaves. Usually they come in clusters. I remember, when I was young...6 or 7...crouching in the dirt, mesmerized by these beautiful flowers. Sometimes I'd pick them and tie them together into a bracelet or a necklace. I think I always imagined that I was making daisy chains, like I always read about. I was shocked when someone told me they were weeds! But it never changed my opinion of them.  Looking at those flowers last night, I saw the child I used to be: toothpick legs, knobby knees, always grubby from kneeling in the dirt, hair always hanging haphazardly in my face. I had a few close friends, I even had my outgoing and "social" years...but inside I was a loner, and happy to be so. I preferred to sit and watch the world go by. I wasn't cool or pretty, or exceptionally bright. My desk was always messy. But I was there, and I was me, and I didn't mind.  As I looked back at my little self, I found myself wishing to be her again. And then I looked down and happened to catch sight of my knees. And I smiled to myself when I realized that they're still pretty knobby! And I still&nbsp;can never manage to really look put together, and my eyes always find themselves drifting to patches of ordinary vegetation.  And I think about how God picked me, a white flower with a brown center, small inside, but hopeful. I'm so thankful that He sees past my always trying to be something more, and He loves the something small best. Look closer... Thank You God for looking closer!  "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart." 1 Samuel 15:7

      Lately, I've had this feeling that everything is moving on without me. Not that I'm not moving forward. Inwardly renewed day by day (though the same lessons often have to repeat themselves in different forms! :)), "professionally" established and developing confidence; personally "older", less dependent, less of a praise-seeker, and less overwhelmed by my own emotions. Vertically...there is growth. But it seems that everyone else is growing...OUT.&nbsp; And away from me. I have this strange feeling that an era of my life has ended, and it has left me alone. Most people here are in a temporary place. Indialantic is means to an end but never a fulfillment, always looking for the next step. But I'm here. Fully here, and loving here. And I feel disconnected.   Why do things always have to change? I don't like change anymore. There was a time when I lived for it, but now all I want is stability. The knowledge that love will be the same today. A confidence in constistency of life's rhythm, lacking chaos of constant upheavel. But I can't make things stay the same, or keep others from changing. Sometimes, the idea of marriage terrifies me because I know my love will never change, and maybe I'll always be left alone, someone will always "outgrow" me. It seems that other people always do. Everyone always wants to keep moving. Isn't it ok to be happy in the stillness? Ok to love what you have? It's so hard to understand. I don't feel the restlessness anymore, all I want is security. I'm tired of the shifting of youth. When is it ok to be "old", and why can I not seem to get there?

      So I think I must have had my first migraine or something this past day. I still can barely open my eyes, but I took an Excedrin migraine, and though my heart is pounding from the extra caffeine, I am feeling well enough to actually get out of bed. I've never had a headache that was irritated more by movement than by light or sound. Actually, I could swear I have meningitis, because my neck is excruciatingly painful also, but unfortunately I'm not feverish...but I keep getting hot flashes. Last night I woke up every time I moved my head and several times soaked in sweat. It's disgusting! At work this morning I took an 800 motrin, and an hour later, two aleve sinus and headache pills. it didn't even make a dent. i managed to survive work though, and intend to go tomorrow because everyone is on vacation and this has been a bear of a week for everyone, so i don't want to leave them short-staffed. oh well...such is life. it's nice to have a job that, even in the moments that i hate or am exhausted and stressed...i know in the next moment i will enjoy it. today, two of my coworkers had a singing conversation about how they were going on vacation and never coming back.&nbsp; even with the pain, i was pretty hysterical.   oh, and speaking of my job...i'm getting a raise! everyone is getting a 3%&nbsp; raise...but my supervisor lobbied to have everyone making under 30,000 increased to that much. that will be a $2500 raise! my supervisor pulled me into a room excitedly yesterday to tell me about it. i think they're always afraid i'm going to leave because of the money. they don't get that it's just not about money. it sort of stinks to realize i can't afford beachside...but then, i can just look forward to that when i marry my sugar daddy. :) just kidding!  speaking of which...i am desparately trying to find a place to live, and getting really excited about it. it's not that i don't enjoy living at home, and all the comforts of it. but there comes a time when you get restless for starting a life of your own, and i'm excited for that. me and cozy, and, most importantly, my Right Hand Man...against the world. i know we can take it. (He's overcome the world! :))  Today I went to let out my friend's dog, and he was so happy to see me that he lay down in my lap, and when cosette got jealous and tried to come to me, he ferociously attacked her. and i yelled at him mercilessly, and then felt horrible when i saw the defeated look on his face. he just wanted me to love him...to give him all the attention for a moment, and make him feel special. i felt so torn...here was this dog looking at me adoringly, while my dog watched with her pathetic puppy dog eyes. and i found myself saying to the other dog: "it's ok, i love you sweetie." and cosette lay down at my feet and waited. and maybe that's what we do with the world. that doesn't know us...that pretends to love us. i am so easily fooled by a longing look. and then you see the fragility of its state...the violence and danger the world holds. and yet...we love it. the world is as jealous as God. But He waits. He calls with His eyes, and when we turn away He's waiting with eager affection. You can't love both at once. They're just too jealous of each other. Love is a funny thing. I love too much. Maybe I love everything. Maybe I'm fooled into thinking everything is good when there is so much ugliness. i just don't want to see it, so i don't. i'd rather not. i wonder if i'll ever learn. all i see are puppy dog eyes.  Anyway...the head continues to pound and the bed is calling. Hope you're all doing well...love you. Joelle

      "You say how's the weather, So I look out the window To brighten my soul; but I can't control the rain that keeps falling. Smile on the outside that never comes in, A comedy, mystery, irony, tragedy... So I scream "let the show begin"! &nbsp; You break me open.  Turn on the light, stumble inside with me." -Jars of Clay &nbsp; Father, break us open. The most painful and beautiful feeling...break us for You.

        Reveal to me my giants:  Certainly uncertainty...  The battlefield is lonely.  Wasted energy fighting brothers-  I turn away.  Look to see an empty ground.  Silent, slingshot in hand;  Eyes saddened,&nbsp;confronted by&nbsp;the enemy's knees.  Face so high above me, clouds obscure-  Still I know that he is laughing...  At my youth, my frailty;  My childish idealism.  How can he not see the shadow behind me?  Emptiness closes in, and in recognizing the barrenness of the land  I raise my head to the Father: changing view of my shoes, of much larger shoes ahead...  Finding most alone is most empowered.  Turning focus from enlarging obstacle-  The warmth of Daddy's eyes,  The touch of His hand, the surge of a heart.  Perspectives change, remembering the victories,  The lions, the bears...  The deliverance of Holiness,  The strength of a broken heart.  And giants fade to something in the wind.  No need for worldly armor,  Just a childish arm, a trusting heart...  And one God-driven stone.

      "The Gospel miracle is that human beings, from time to time, evade the temptations of power and brittleness and manage to vulnerably love another person who has all the potential of turning on us and rejecting us. Every time such love is ventured, another piece of the Gospel is proclaimed, and the kingdom of God is made more credible." -Brennan Manning

      "All which I took from thee I did but take,  Not for thy harms, But just that thou might'st seek it in My arms.  All which thy child's mistake Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home :  Rise, clasp My hand, and come !"  Halts by me that footfall :  Is my gloom, after all, Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly ?  "Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,  I am He Whom thou seekest ! Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest me."  -Frances Thompson

      How beautiful it is to know that we are not products of the past, but that the morning...so beautifully designed to parallel the hope of new beginnings...brings a day that has never happened before. i dare you to move! so easy to live restrained by the guilt of the past...so many mistakes...even yesterday, so many mistakes. but today...today i can be so dead, so limp...that i am vigorously alive! the mysteries of my Father...do you rejoice with me? Rejoice with me! We are His, He has created us, chosen us, saved us, forgiven, renewed, and He will fulfill His purposes inside of us...His fallen creatures, washed by His blood. Oh my Father...I am so wildly in love with Him in the moment. the only promise of unfailing love...the only promise that in the dance we will stumble, we may even start doing the tango when we're supposed to be waltzing...but it's ok. He'll never drop my hand. Heart...so heavy, so dead, so filled with confusion...so tangled by this world and by your own oblivion...why do you rejoice within me?   hope  "Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." philippians 3:12-14

      Lost in blackened twist of tangles, Thrashing through the darkest night; Trapped inside, I've lost the vision, Clouds obscure the highest height.  Mass confusion comes from leaning On the biggest form I see, On the weakened solid mass; The "humble" pilot known as me.

      Well folks, it's the friday morning before a nice long weekend. i have a feeling this day will last forever! the good news is, my supervisor had mercy on me as far as scheduling and put me in my own slow clinic this morning, which is especially important because i still have to finish evaluating 11 more resumes for the music ministry position before 6:30 pm tonight...should be interesting. normally, i love the 4th of July. normally, it is my favorite holiday. this year, for some reason, i just know it's going to be horrible. these past few days i have had a burning stomachache indicative of something terrible to come at any moment. i don't know what terrible thing could possibly happen, because certainly nothing wonderful has happened recently to be ruined...but i just have a feeling of impending doom. usually, these things come for a reason. and the thing is, i know somehow intuitively, even if i never find out this side of heaven what i'm feeling sick about...i'll probably find out someday. so i guess all i can do is pray in a very nonspecific manner.  lately, i've been looking at my life and thinking about how it seems like nothing ever changes. i always think i'm growing towards something every time something painful happens. but lately, reading some of my writing from years ago...i've been thinking that it's all on loop cycle and nothing will ever change. i feel tired and resigned, and i just keep moving, because there's nothing really better to do. i know there must be something happening that's bigger than me, but i'm too small to see it, and i'm tired of dancing. sometimes, i read about david dancing...how he was so secure in God's love, so trusting and full of life that he had no choice but to express himself in such an unrestrained manner. i see him dancing like that, and i think "doesn't he know? doesn't he know it hurts to dance?" And sometimes I think about how people use God to do whatever they want, even if it's things that hurt you...and I've been thinking...you know...i've had a lot of hurts. I've been hit, kicked, choked, and violated...i've been called names, told i was worthless, told i was stupid...but sometimes i think it's spiritual abuse that is the most painful of them all. because it hits directly the deepest heart of you. i think about how precious God thinks my heart is, and i wonder how he could expect me to ever expose it to the harsh elements of this world that never change. but the funny thing is...i'm so idealistic that i always hold out hope...God made His people beautiful...He made the world beautiful...shouldn't that mean it doesn't hurt so much to love?

      Through panic stricken night of dreams, I've won again, and lost it seems. You've made my hell and let me fly, I've hit the ground, I've touched the sky. You've watched me wallow in unrest, And felt the heartbeat in my chest; Today you'll be my secret sin, Tomorrow I'll be whole again.

      "Love is not a word that describes my feelings, it is not a technique by which i fulfill my needs; it is not an ideal, abstract and pure, on which i meditate or discourse. it is acting in correspondence with or in response to God in relation to persons."  -Eugene Peterson

      These past couple of days, despite the chaos of back-to-school shots and being in charge of the teen clinic...I have found that strength is beginning to come back to my bones. (I have also experienced some mild internal bleeding, but that's beside the point!) :) There is something about finding a renewed vigor, a renewed passion for life after you have been struggling to merely exist for weeks or even months. And now, as I consider it, as I share these things with my Father...I realize that this is the way things are. This is the way life is, trapped in the confines of this world. Last night the pastor said: "Lord, if you tarry, let us continue to live faithfully." Whenever someone mentions Him returning, coming back to rescue us, His bride, I get tears in my eyes! I long for the completeness, the opening up of my flesh-ridden view of His face...a chance to grasp even a shred of His Greatness. The world hurts...the world focuses on all the wrong things. I am as guilty as anyone else of these skewed perspectives and chasing after the wind...finding my hands close only around empty air. But there's something about a song that stirs the soul, something about a surfboard under your feet that awakens a tired heart...something about the Gentleness of a God who knows our weaknesses, and who knows the sensitivities of our bodies and our need for every realm of emotion...something in the space of utter enjoyment that aches for the perfection to come! We are never to experience times where we are merely getting by, clinging to the Father, holding to shreds of hope. If we could only keep our eyes on the eternal...it would all become so dim. But He knows the limitations of our bodies...He made them. I am occasionally consumed with guilt when the passion drains from my eyes...when I feel tired and stagnant. but perhaps it is a fallacy that Satan uses against us, to convince us of our failure at Love. I think God knows...I think all He asks is that we "hold unswervingly to the hope we profess." He who promises IS faithful. last night, we heard that God's definition of hope is different from ours...that hope in Him comes from knowing that He has it, and that no matter what, it will work out to His glory. I think I often regret my own childish and superficial hopes because I forget that. A born and incorrigible romantic, I am a huge fan of happy endings! And then, when we find a vigorous hope rising up in our throats again...how much more exciting? How much more the adrenaline of knowing we can continue to love, to live, to hope...not because it's our capabilities, but because He's got it, and He's faithful! I feel happy. I have asked Him over and over for this "intense gladness". This morning, He has shared it with me. I have found my heart lies deeply in my work these days...and I find that there is something so terribly satisfying about loving the unlovable...society's rejects...who still have a sad and childlike hope in their eyes that begs to be seen. There is something about seeing them open up when they are treated like human beings...about seeing the same look in their eyes that you have seen in your Brother or Sister in Christ, and realizing that they have the same longings for God that we do. sometimes i wonder if i enjoy it too much...aren't we not supposed to get earthly rewards? I must get to work, or I will no longer have my job. Have a good day today! "Reach out and experience the depths! Rise to the heights! Live full lives, full in the fullness of God!" Ephesians 3:something :) (The Message)

      "Have some of you noticed that we are not yet perfect? (No great surprise, right?) And are you ready to make the accusation that since people like me, who go through Christ in order to get things right with God, aren't perfectly virtuous, Christ must therefore be an accessory to sin? The accusation is frivolous. If I was "trying to be good", I would be rebuilding the same old barn that I tore down. I would be acting as a charletan. What actually took place is this: I tried keeping rules and working my head off to please God, and it didn't work. So I quit being a "law man" so that I could be God's man. Christ's life showed me how, and enabled me to do it. I identified myself completely with Him. Indeed, I have been crucified with Christ. My ego is no longer central. It is no longer important that I feel righteous before you or have your good opinion, and I am no longer driven to impress God. Christ lives in me. The life you see me living is not "mine", but it is lived by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. I am not going back on that." Galatians 2:17-25 (The Message)  I think there is some ease in recognizing when we are trying to please people, but it is such a stretch trying to figure out how we can go about pleasing God without TRYING to please God. Sometimes, I think I try to fix things and make them how it seems they should be so that God will be pleased with me. While I no longer live in fear of punishment...I guess it's the human drive to please those we love by DOING...when perhaps all He asks is for the sitting, the waiting, the Loving, the communion with Him. It's good to know I don't have to work so hard. It's the process...not the product. ;) Why is it that constantly feel the need to put ourselves in chains?

      "Peering into the mists of gray That shroud the surface of the bay, Nothing I see except a veil Of fog surrounding every sail. Then suddenly against a cape A vast and silent form takes shape, A great ship lies against the shore Where nothing has appeared before.  Who sees a Truth must often gaze Into a fog for many days; It may seem very sure to him Nothing is there but mist-clouds dim. Then suddenly his eyes will see A shape where nothing used to be. Discoveries are missed each day By men who turn too soon away."  Lately, in the mornings when I first wake up and begin praying...the words "show me Your most excellent way" have been running over and over again in my mind. I just keep praying them on repeat cycle, like a chant, but I never really knew what I was praying for. This morning I decided to look up that passage in the Bible, the verse that talks about God's most excellent way. When I came to it, I realized that it is the introduction to the love chapter, 1 corinthians 13! i found myself knowing exactly why I was praying this for myself. I am so tired...I am so discouraged. This morning...even this evening when I lay down after work. i found myself thinking...why do i try? why do i get up? it doesn't even matter. nothing i do is ever good enough for anyone, i'll always open myself up and i'll always get my underbelly ripped out when i expose it. Then I read in 1 corinthians...."love always PROTECTS, always HOPES, always PERSERVERES, love never fails...." Father, give me a Love that always hopes.
