       So, life around my house has been pretty busy lately in preparation for the coming of our new exchange student from Korea, who comes in a week. She is to stay in my sister Clarissa's room, and therefore, she and I had to switch beds, which meant mom had to clean the carpets while we were moving stuff around and all. But it's all good, cuz I totally got to rearrange my room. It looks so different and it's gonna take some getting used to.

       I have found this song to be very inspirational, and it always seems to help me when I am down...

      So here I am, not finished with my 100 pages, but my parents aren't home right now, and they don't know that.   Today I got to get out of the house, yeah!!! I went over to Mary's and watched The Princess Diaries and then we saw The Princess Diaries 2, which ended up being a really cute movie.  After we walked out of the theater, this weird guy with blue hair and some kid sitting next to him kept staring at us, so we walked to the other end of the theater to wait for my mom to come get us.  He was kinda scary!  Then I got home and left again to take my sis to soccer practice, oh joy!! The fun of being the oldest kid...  Well I am gonna go read up in my room before my parents get home.  So, until then ~

       Why do parents have to be parents sometimes, I mean honestly, why?  They can make me so pissed off sometimes!!!  So, my dad comes in this morning as I was starting to wake up and tells me that he and my mom were talking.  They want me to get my summer reading done asap for no particular reason and don't want me to spend much time online.  I have till school starts, I don't see what the whole rush is.  My dad wants me to read a freakin' 100 pages a day.  I am only allowed to be online from like 9:00 to 9:30 and I think that's if I finish my 100 pages, I am pushing it now...  So if anyone wants to ever talk, it would be best to call, seeing as how I wont be online much, or perhaps you can rescue me from my house, please do...  Well my time is already up, until we meet again ~

      I met someone today.  He is really nice and even went on a walk with me.  He sat next to me as we enjoyed the sky, and he even walked me to my door to say goodnight.  Such a gentleman!!!  His name is Boo, and yes, unfortunately, he is my cat...

        Today was a rather long, boring day, but in the end I guess it was worth it... To begin with, 6:45ish is just too early to begin a day. Who in there right mind would think getting up that early is a good thing? Anywho, so my family headed off a little after 8:30 to the air-show... After arriving there a little after 9 and getting set up and such, I had till 11 o'clock to keep myself occupied... I didn't bring a school book to read (which I got talked to by a parent for that...) and everyone decided to go look around and left my sis Clarissa and I to watch all the stuff. My sis had a book with her, leaving me no one to talk to and only the sky to look to for comfort. That was the beginning...

        Sleep is apparently not a very common thing in my vocabulary lately...  Here I am late at night once again, talking to people.  Today was nothing special really...  The most exciting part of my day really was just the past hour, being talked to by an anonymous person for quite a while, and then, finally finding out who the master mind was...

        Alright, so here I am...  staring at the screen as usual, and have officially decided to start my own blog, hence the reason you are reading this.  Well I really don't have much to say about anything right now, cuz my life is just sooo interesting... So, I will write laters, I just felt special for actually making one of these and felt like writing about nothing, which apparently I am good at doing. So, until then, ciao ~
