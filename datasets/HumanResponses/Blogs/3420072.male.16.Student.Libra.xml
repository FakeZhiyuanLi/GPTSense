      Life seems to hit you in the most weirdest ways cause I think the most traumatic thing that ever happened between myself and my father was a fight we had when he was dropping me off at school. Well I didn't need this I already felt down as it was. When we got to school he ended up saying stuff that was really hurtful and I couldn't take it. I think from then on I couldn't look at my father the same again. I broke down. I think that's why I always feel down. I never really that often get to the high points in my life.  aint life funny how it makes you remember old times when new stuff happen you start to feel a sense of nostalgia. i think it could also be why i found my self getting in trouble at my old school it was cause i was haveing problems at home and i didnt like the school my so i started to muck around and mess up. it funny how things just come to you.  i am currently making a video for a media assign ment i am doing and it all rather feels quite easy for some reason i am just breezing through the subject like it was the easiest subject in the world. i dont know why it comes so easy mybe it was somthing i was born to do but i dont know i just take it one step at a time.  i find that the more you write down the harder it is to think of mre stuff to write down.  so i'll leave it hear so not to risk of having nothing to write when i post next.

      I think there are a few things in my life that absolutely get me going. I absolutely think Jim carrey is cool. I love the show red dwarf and futurama and very mad that futurama got cancelled.  these things happen throughout life new shows come and go then there are the shows that you hate that just wont get off the air. But hey I cant complain I'm glad some shows are on.  life can be so f*cked up. As I have a lot of influence in my own life I can easily say that I influence my self in what I want to write. For me metal music is so relaxing. I don't know why its just when I hear it I can lose myself in the music.  but who knows what can influence you through out your life it can be all the big things or it could be the small things like you notice something has changed just the slightest like someone has changed the style of their hair or something small like that.  life changes sometimes for the better sometimes not. Its always hard to make new friends when you absolutely know no one especially when your seen as a bit of a weirdo. Life can be shit.  I've never thought of myself as much or a writer cause I always start somewhere and end in a completely different place from once I started. I find it strange to writer. I think where I first started writing was when I was in year five and for some reason I found it necessary to turn the never ending story in to a story slightly change but in my own way now I have no idea why I did this but I did and just think of it as expressing something that I wanted to do.  so who knows what could happen to me.   I always find it difficult to get my thoughts especially after school I think that it really drains me of energy I'm glad that at the moment I have 2 weeks off school so it will also allow me to write up here what ever I want.  writing i think can be some of the most difficult thibgs to doo you just never know what you can write about.

      well like i said you never know wats gonna happen. life is very strange and i seem to have led quite a weird one.  life dosent seem it would be hard but you have to work and do all this other stuff just to survive. life can be cruel but so can i i just seem to muddle through existance its not my fault that bad stuff seems to happen to me. life to my is like a choclate box cause you never know what your gonna get. gee that was weird...... well my mind seems to drift off latly i just cant seem to stay focused on any particular thing.  i always seem to get down easily i dont know why but i do. like today i went out and all i wanted to do was go home life is so very confusing some days all you want to do is roll over and die. life just gives you so many questions that you want answerd but youll never get the chance to answer all the questions you want answerd like why is the sky bluei know there is a scientific explain but who wants to hear crap said by people in white coats not that all scientists wear white coats but hey i'm just generalizing. i'm not trying to sound like a git but i dont really want all my q's answerd i mean if i knew everything that i wanted to know what would be worth living for if youve got no questions to think about.  to me life is an ever expanding question that just keeps getting bigger and bigger dont get me wrong some times things can get answerd but most of the time life just continues with out you and youll never have enough time to answer it all.  if i were to ramble on about all this stuff i would pobally start to get boring.its like listening to the same song over and over again at some point you will think get that shit off its driving me insane so i will stop writing about this subject who knows i might finally find what subject i find dear to my heart but i doubt it. thats what i like about my life i always find things to change.

      i never thought i would get this far in my blog i thought yeah i'll do one post but look at it now thirteen chapters and i'm still going strong.  people never understand what you want them to i always find it difficult but its impossible never mind relationships its just getting the courage to ask someone out thats the bitch. you think to your self why why do i have to be a guy i have the hard job yeah girls have it easy they dont have to ask people out. you then start to think to yourself i'll ask her later or i'll do it tomorrow then you find out your too late someone already has youve missed out you feel like a wreck thinking why oh why couldnt i have done it sooner or why o why did i not be around for that day i could have stopped it. then you find your self later down the track getting asked questions by the unnamed girl if you like them and you think shit do i really want to let them know i i had felt and you can never know what to say so you go all quiet then they assume  that you did in all respect you did but you dont want them to know even if they are in a relationship you just dont want to be asked cirtain questions.  then you find your self pondering like what if i had asked her what if i had done that then you bring your self lower and lower you start to think shit why do i still have feelings for this such person. then it comes to you......  so i'll let you keep thinking on what might happen who know i might want to continue that such thought later on but who knows how life will shape to be you might find some one new you might even find the one your ment to be with but that the thing with life its just so differnt you just never know whats going to happen. i mean if i knew this stuff was going to happen through out my life i migh try to do stuff differntly who knows you might even start to wonder what if i was more like that guy would i have the girl would i have a better life then you think to your self and you find that your perfect just the way you are you dont need to change for people just be yourself and thatll get you through.

      today i had to goto school i didnt really mind going but i had a few of how today was going to go seeing as most my friens were away on SWL(Structured Workplace Learning)so i didnt know what to do much around school.  i had to do an english assignment you can tell i was thrilled to do that. the class seemed to flow through pretty quickly so i really didnt think i did much today. oh well theres always tomorrow.  life to me doesnt amount up to much when you really look at it its more like a big playing feild full of stuff to destroy and to interact with. i thought i would really not get along with alot of people but hey i was wrong. for some reason i am really enjoying the school i'm at even though i have had my course of problems.  wh knows i might not want to leave at the end of the year but i doubt that lifes to short to spend all your time at school.

      things always change i find hat the more you find out about some one the more you change around them like i found out that this person liked me and i didnt like them so i started to act differntly around them.  life is the most confusing thing that can happen. the call having a baby an act of god i call it an act of love making who knows what will happen in the lime light.  i relize now that i might bore people and i say sorry to that but i just find stuff that is important or i want to talk about it so interesting i dont know why but it just seems to fit.  people call me weird at school but i dont care but its when they start to get on my nerves that they start to aggrevate me i dont know why but i'm, easily annoyed by people latly so i shut them out.  its strange to talk about how i feel on the internet your life to me people want to kee it private and with these blogs it just makes a lot of people open to many differnt things. i find that it is the easiest war to releive stress i couldnt see any other way so i started blogging and now i'm feeling a lot better. now i hope i can just keep up with updating but most of the time when i'm on the computer i jsut find it easy to play games and forget about what i want to do so i'm in an abbivilant place.  tv to me doesnt seem like a threat its they way you youse it thats the threat. people say that i am very open minded i think i am as well i will always try ne things even if it means its very repulsive.  the thought of war is a very frightning thing so when i see all these things on tv i think they are taking it too far but as allways theres nothing you can really do about it.  ther are many things in life that i dont like most of those things are to do with how people treat people. as my mum always say treat people as you like to be treated i know its one of the most used lines in the world but its true you not oing to get any where if you treat people badly.

      maybe i should describe what is essentually me well i am also know as white rabbit(Rabbit for short) its not really like me to discuss my feelings to people so i keep them bottled up i think thats why i sometimes take rage out or i just dont want to talk to people it probally also why i seem disruptive in class i dont know why i just dont like showing that side of me much there are a few people who have seen that side but not many.  well i havnt really had a huge troubled childhood but stuff does happen to me. some stuff i just cant explain. but lets regress to the troubled years of years 8 to 10 at school this was prob my worst 4 years of school dont get me started there were a few good weeks and days but i tend not to deleve in to those 4 years lets just say that the school was shit and i was put down alot by the teachers.   and there were kids that always picked on me i just never liked that school or the politics of it. it was very depressing to be there. to think i actually dont know where where it went wrong it just happend so i was like i dont want to spend forever here. so in the end when i went to year 11 i moved school an its been the best ever scince.  ont get me wrong i still have good friends from my old school but most of them were in fact shit.  i actually dont know how i actually made it through my grades were bad and i was told that iwasnt actually good at anything.  but all thats changed i now have some really good friends and i'm moving on if anyone asked me what my worst moment was at that school it would have to be the whole thing i just found everyday a downer then i was having family problems on top of that so i was like crap what am i going to do i cant cope with all this shit..............But some how i did make it through and i'm glad i did every thing has been going good for me after those years.  so i think i have alot on my mind and thats just life it would be too easy if you just muddeld through life with nothing going on theres just no way that anyone hasnt got problems in their lives.

      i never really got what being only human was not untill today.to me the word human means to be imperfect thats what everybody is its nothing you can change but being our language it can mean so many things plus you can make your own meaning up for the words of your choice you coul even make up a word if you dare.  i dont think fate matters much i think we happen to make our own path nothing i think is left up to chance if it happens it happens thats my saying any way so if your like me and just like to party then i'm up for it but you know if nothing much happens its not my fault.  i never got the grasp of what having a relationship was i guess thats why i seem to push every one away its not my fault i just cant seem to get the hang of it. but if there are any tips out there let me know i'm all up for sudgestions. so i have 2 weeks holi next week so i'm not sure what i might do ii'll prob just catch up with work and continue with this page just trying to make it a beast that it is.  well i think i have run out of ideas for this post i'll post more once it comes to mind.  remember life is a crazy crazy place and ont forget your comments are welcome

      life is like listening to a song you never know how its going to turn out you also get the songs that you can relate to your life i have 2 songs which i think relate to my life. they are Marilyn Mansons - Dont Pray and finger elevens - therapy. to me those songs are the most influential and relate to how i am. theres no question about it i seem to most people a book with a hard to read contents i like being like that unbale to figure out what i am like but if they listen to those songs they probally will get me like that.  i dont mind if people do or dont get me i just like being a differnt canvas thats hard to paint a picture on.  my blogs dont seem that funyy i do seem very serious on these i think i should lighten up.  well i think the funniest thing that has happend to me was when my lip was nearly ripped off by a dog i was five at the time and the dog was a blue healer. the prob about a year later a crazy crab at a go at it as well. what a pet lover i was.  but on a serious not i did not like getting my lip bit by a dog i had to get a tetnis shat and about 7 stitches ibn my lip and the dog wasnt even put down for like 4 years after the incident.  well more later must continue gaming. o_o

      i never thought much on how life can change so quickly  ive just been sitting here listening and seeing how my life has changed over the past 16 years. most of which i cant remember but thats like a lot of things in the space from year 7 to 12 many things have happend lets just say ive been picked on ive had good friends that have moved and have found some people quite annoying. theres just many aspects of life you hasve to deal with.  lets say i am happy with my life even though some of it has been pretty shit and depressing. but what can i say life goes on even when you dont want it to. i wouldnt mind if time stood still at that perfect moment in your life when every thing has gone right and your just at that point were you feel nothing can go wrong.  life is an experience and if you cant put up with it then dont try but dont resort to death either thats just being a coward. if i were to resort to death i would have to be pretty desperate not saying i havent thought about it who hasnt but life shall go on.  my life has sometimes been  a mess so you know what i thought fuckit i'm just gonna try harder and its working i have good friends and i'm enjoying life to its fullist even though it sometimes doesnt seem to move that quick i'm still haveing fun. but yeah i do have my down points like the time when i was in my it essentials class an some one put paper in my hood and i through it out and it happend it hit him(not like i ditched it at him or something its only paper how could that really hurt any way.) well he decided with his small brain to hit me 4 times quickly in the throat and i gotta tell you that is a crap place to get hit. it didnt hurt a whole heap but i was so tempted to frickin smash him but i calmed down and put it aside that would be good reading if you see me get up and just start bashing the shit out of him but thats just not me even though i'm know to resort to violence when someone pisses me off but i'm not strong so i thought i would be mature and i told the teachers that are in charge of the class just to let them know what had happend in class i didnt want to take it further but if it happend again i just dont know what i might do. so thats a typical day in my life nothing much happens but when it does it can be quite funny.  i never try to write heaps but some how that just sometimes happens but when i try to do school work the best i can do is like 4 sentences at most gee its easy to talk about something that interests you.   i think the worst point in my life was when i found out my parents were getting a divorce it now been about 9 years an i still dnt think i quite got over it but hey all you can do is move on.  i think the highest point in my life was when i won a prize worth $2600AUD that was the best thing i ever found out i'm not trying to brag but believe me youll want to brag when you find out youve won something so cool. ok i'll let you know how i won it i enterd a compition for the matrix reloaded dvd preorder comp and i just happend to be one of the 14 winners across the whole of australia i thought it was pretty cool. the prize consisted of a samsung 17inch widescreen tv and a matrix themed dvd playerand they all go pretty good in my room. lets just say when you get to a high point in your life you just cant help but brag about it.  well i'll leave it at this dont be a square live out side the box you live in you never know what might just happen.

      well i have decided not to make my own page because it would be too much hassel to get it up and running on blogger.com so i've decided just to use this one.  well any way no much happens around i find that most of the time i can be home alone which some times is kinda cool.  theres not much going through my head i just seem to be droning on about nothing like how are babys born? well i can answer that question with one word sex. sex is cool if you have done it yet but i'm just waiting for they special girl and the right time to get rid of my virginity. lets just sayi dont care if people know that its normal its not some kind of race to see who has sex first.  well on to a differnt topic nothing seems to be sacred around me i feel that i can talk about pretty much anything i want with out offending too much people i just hope they havent got offende oh well screw them if they have i'm not the one to really swear alot even though i'm known to on more than one occasion it just life.  well i seem to have nothing to write so if anyone comes up with a good topic just post it in the post secion i'm up for all ideas.

      Ive had some time now to think about what to write and i've come to the conclusion things come out better if you just write what you are feeling at the time. I mean its not as though thinking about something is not worth doing but it doesnt come off as fresh an idea as one that you just think of at like just this second.   Emotions: what are they to me emotions and the way you feel are intertwined but completely differnt i mean you could feel bad has hell but you could be on top of the world emotion wise. to me emotions are a myth it is just some word on how you should feel at a particular feeling you have which i think is poppycock. i know i could be wroung but hey i'm open for sudgestions.   if i were to start my blog from scrath i think i would have to stucture it so it was user friendly but hey i dont really care how i come off to people i mean i'm not a talented writer so i can do big words like because i mean who really like to use the word because any way its a crap word.  so i thought you know i'm lying in bed just thinking about my life and i thought wouldnt it be great if i designed my own page and i thought that would be cool so bear with me at the current moment as i get my new page up and running.  well my mind is blank so i will have to think even thouugh to me it doesnt come out fresh but hats sometimesx what you have to do.    ciao

      i'm still on my first day and dont you hate that once you finnish a post you just think of more stuff to write i know i could have put all the posts i did in to one giant huge one but who would like that...thats why i'm going for the chapter thing its just a good medium to keep and start agian where you want each post.  like i know i could write about relevent things like politics or shit like that but who really cares any way.  well i could start with chatting about stuff that i feel pasionate about but who gives a crap whats passionate and not. so i thought i would rather talk about what i like doin.  well i'm not one of those sick(well you dont have to be sick minded you could be curious.) teens whos into porn i couldnt give a damn with wat people want to do with their lives i mean if they want to have sex on camers its totally up to them i mean they would have to feel pretty desperate or confident with them selves to do it so go on them.  i mean what is the real big deal with nudity its natural its not like something your not going to or have already seen. Big eal if your child is exposed to nudeity/porn there going to one day and its better to find information about that from your parents than from some teacher you hardly know i mean come on parents get real you cant protect your children for their whole lives i mean practicly any search engine that has image search is a porn site.   so i thought i would talk about something differnt in this post and not delve in to the psyche of my life i mean if you want to hear about twisted things from my life then yay me. but if you dont like what i write about then dont read its totally up to you this is just a place i can let all my thoughts out and and just a place for me to hang.  but i must admit i am enjoying posting my thoughts i dont know why but i am who knows i might continue to do this for a long time.  well i think thats enough typing/writing for one day and i say good night to you all.

      You would think that i have run out of things to say in a space of an hour but hey my mind is still brimming with creative jucies. i have decided not to tell my friends about my blog i think i would get sympathy from people if they knew what i was like on the inside i dont want things to change with people but i will tell you this if they do find my blog good for them but dont spread the word to heaps of people well you can if you want i'm all for it but hey just be the smae i'm not differnt now that you know more about my life stuff that i find hard to talk about and dont get offended if i say something abot you i still consider you a friend even though i dont show it much.  i dont know what made decide to lay out my thoughts in chapters i mean i'm not aiming for a book or anything to me it just felt like the most differnt thing to do mind you there are provally heps of people deciding to write like this but i dont care i'm just writing like this because i feel the most comfortable doing it this way.  its simple to see that i have a lot of things on my chest that i prob want off but i dont want to see a psyche i'm not crazy well you dont have to be to see a psyche but i think i feel the most comfortable writing my thoughts well typing my thoughts that is so lets start from some where i havent already gone.  well i'm single i have no one that i'm keen on and i dont really care if some one likes me well good for them if they do but if they dont let me know how they feel about me how can i feel anything back i mean you have to put something in to get some thing back.  i've never had a real keen interest to write but writing this blogg just seems so natural. so i think i will press on.  i have a lot of good friends but there are some people that i just cant stand for one thing or another. have you ever just got the feeling when your talking to someone then stuff that they usually do just starts to get on your nerves i have that feeling all the time latly. i just cant seem to get things off my cest maybe thats why i started this blog. for some reason i just keep switching topics thats prob just how i feel like writing/typing.  i'm really into computer games for someone that dosent know which i doubt any of you would is that i cant wait for Half-life 2 it just seems like the perfect game for me it just looks like all the stuff i wanted in a game is i there.  but enough about my nerdyness in games i just like to say is that i have contemplated death a few times. Yes i do mean dying. i mean i would neverb really do it but i get that depressed it just seems like the only option out. now that i am at this school i have a lot less of those feelings but i still get quite depressed then i just fake that i'm tired. i just cant seem to get anything straight i dont know whether it is just every thing moving too fast in my life or that i just dont really care on what happens throughout my life who knows cause i surly dont i mean i dont want to kill my self but  have contemplated on it.  but ive always wonderd what death looks like a lot of people sya hes a hooded creature clad in black with a scythe but who knows it could be this beautiful woman or this stunning dragon or it could be this hobo that lives up the road. who knows cause i surly dont but hey i'm open to sudgestions even if is to help me with my spelling.  i mean if i really were to commit suicide it would mean missing out on all the good things in life s kids my message to you is dont youll one day regret the day you did(even though youll be dead) but you just dont know whats around the corner. it might be the love of your life or it could be the best thing thats ever happend to you in your life so just old on and see what comes you just dont know what is out there.  i mean i'm not trying to be cynical or anything its just my view of my life so who knows what will happen around the corner i surly dont.  but i'm dabbeling on you just dont want to see me keep ranting on but if thats what you want i can but hey.  some people consider me to be one of the funniest people theyve met but i don't know i could be but who knows i dont rekkon i'm that funny.  i think i have found my passio in life and that is editing and i mead film editing i just love it i'm like the top in my class (Yr12 Media if you were wondering) but when i do it i just have rthat much joy for it i just find it that fun. who knows mabey one day i just might make it nto the industrey heres to hoping its the only thing you can do.  i'm not a real fan of sport but i do enjoy a good round of golf for some reason it just fells so relaxing when you just going at your own pace.  so i'll leave you with this is that if i have learned anything at all it is that life is the mst precious thing you can have and if you abuse it your a fool.

      Well 2nd post of the day well who knows i might end up on day/chapter 10 by the end of the night.  in the like 10 minutes that have passed i still havent learnt how to spell but i dont care. i could use spell check but that would be too much hassel.  well where should i start hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  ok ive got my stuff ready for the ball my mate wants me to drve there on a couch.....Yes a Couch he wants to put a motor in it and drive it there.......I think i might pass..........But if worst comes to Worst i just might have too...........   any way what am i wearing you might be asking its a black dinner tux with a grey shirt and a red tie and no its not going to be an ugly bow tie.  enough about wats gonna happen in the future we want the now well now atr the moment i am sitting on the computer typing this very blog you are reading well not right when you read it hey you could read it a moth after i post it i dont care but its wat is ment by  he NOW right at this very secon on this very spot.  so i thought do people really want to read about me or wanna learn how i got the nickname smeg.  well it started with me loving tye show red dwarf in all its coolness. and then me getting a cap that actually sez SMEG! and then my friend started calling me SMEG so i didnt mind and then i wanted it on my leavers jumper but i wasnt allowed because it was alot like the bad word which i will not mention so i put it backwards on it !gemS i think it looks cool.  well any way the begining of the week started out good i had to walk to school wooptedoo gee i really liked that the day came and went without a hitch so iwill move on to the dayafter nothing much happend there but nothing really does when you want it too.  well i have othing really to talk about except that Sweet Poison is cool and am glad she moved in to my group of friends well ive seen her roud and stuff and then she game to join my group which i was okay with and she thinks i'm cool cause i can do a damn fine smeagol impression (you know the runt from lord of the rings the one alos known as Gollum) well i dont mind that shes joind my group seeing is that i have like 4 dffernt groups that i hang out with.  any way i'm not saying this to impress her i just felt like it because she gave me the address to this fine Blogger web wich i think is cool cause i can get all my thoughts out.  well i had a tough year when i was in year ten sorry to dwell in the past but i just have to get it off my chest. well it all started with me staying at my dads house and he was gong to go to the hospital because his back was killing him(think maybe of some Back problem he had from a while back) well any way he got me to get my mother to pick me up and we couldnt find the keys to the house so i could feed the dog. well any way i left and then my mother and fathe were talking she was in the car ready to go any way my father fliped out and started bashing the crap out of the car(which wasnt even my mothers car it was her boyfriends car)sowe got home and then i had to go to the police station to file a statement and at that age i wasnt too keen on the idea but i did it.  so things werent good between me and my father for a while and i got im to drop me off at school because it was raining and some how things got worse so i spent some time with the counsellor consoling stuff about what made me so upset(me upset how could i be me being a man and every thing) well life resumed as usual and i finally patched stuff up with my father but somethings arnt worth mentioning because it is still tense some times life goes on and so do i.  i've never really grasped the concept of love to me love is what you feel when you just cant feel more happer about someone. so to me love is a concept of relationships and when you finally do feel it for some one you just want them to feel it with you too bad if they dont.  i've alwys thought growing up i was differnt but i relize every one is differnt too. its not bad to feel differnt its just the way you are and if you say that you aren't differnt your just kidding your self so take my advice and just live life to the fullist.

I have been meaning to do a blog for a while now and only thought of just now to do it.  well many things have happend throughout my life some things i am ashamed of and some things ive found quite funny.  lets start some where i am 16/17 soon. my parents a divorced and i like anything anime or to do with the computer. i am a gamer but a pritty crap one at that even though people say ii am good i still think i could be better. I cant spell and am no good a grammer.  many things have happend through out my life and i dont like to dwell on the bad stuff but people alwyas say that is the best things to read about so my page might be boring but i dont care i just want to releive my thoughts people who dont like that can stick it.  i was teased alot at my school befor my current one so when i moved school i felt releived stuff like that can really put you down.  life love and romance i think people like well i have the life thing down so i'll have to work on the other two.  i am currently doing cisco and it essentials at school wich i have a keen intrest in but my fav subject by far is media studies latly i am not doing the latest assign ment because the teacher wants me to learn this program he got and seeing that everyone asks me for help in the class including the teacher i felt like i should plus i think its fun.  if i were to state my life in three words i couldnt i have to many tjhings to talk about but i've decided to keep it in the present and see how things progress from there.  well i will post more but first i thin k i will play some games and music stay tuned for more talse of INTEREST!!! :)

      well its been a while since my last post i dont know why i havent been posting i've just had 2 weeks off school and all i did was laze around home as you do when you have nothing to do.   well my school ball is tomorrow and i recon i am gonna look quite fetching my tux and shirt is black and i'm gonna have a red tie but what will top off the whole thing is that my hair is being dyed black and there are gonna be big chunks of my hair dyed black. How cool is that gonna look.  well nothing much has happend to me in the past few weeks i am still of course single and looking but i'll probally never find a person who is interested in me. Oh well(Has A Quiet Sob) well back to my manly ness and is still un able to spell or use grammer yay!!!!!! well i'm still macho as ever cause i dont want people to know my feelings although i occasionly let them out but all is good cause i'm A Sensitive New Age Guy searching for a Sensitive New Age Girl but who knows if i'll ever find that special one. i might have to start making money so i can um err..........Go out yes that it go out to pubs but i'm not old enough for that oh well 2 years away then i can drink in pubs yay!!!!!!   life hits you in strange i relised the other day is that i have no clue what i am gonna do when i finnish school i'm just not sure what is gonna happen to me maybe i could apply to be a full time bum cause geee is that hard work always feeling tired sometimes getting back cramps but its all good if you love the passion of what your doing.  if i were to ever get a job i would wnat it in either the film industrie or the computing/electrical world.for some reason i seem to be the best in my media studies class at making little films for our projects to work on plus i also seem to be the best at useing the technology so much as its gotten me more work to do in class.. i've now relised that i want to buy a digital video camera cause i love making movies and editing them i just find it so much fun i also like directing them and for some reason being in them not that i would rather be behind the camera but who knows what'll happen to me i just hope its something i like.  so heres to the future..
