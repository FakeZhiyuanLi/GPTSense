      Haha~ yesterday, i went to watch Shrek2 alone.. Haha.. I dun really know what i am doing.. Suddenly got the urge to watch it.. Had asked yingZ to go and watch with me but she cant make it.. So i went and watch.. Well.. i took a long bus ride..around 1++hr.. It was a very nice ride.. On the ride i learn things.. I give myself time to think.. I start to believe in something.. In this world, there's no one i can trust.. no one really to lean on.. And what i feel at this very moment no one understand, no one can sense anything.. Their lives still go on... The world wont stop when u feel sad.. Yesterday when i walk past a funeral.. I ask myself.. Who will be there, who will actually cry? Deep down i know the ans.. Haha.. i cant believe my life really so meaningless to everyone.. Yesterday i asked Ceyi to accompany me for Macdonald.. He told me he had to work.. Does it work mean everything to him?? Am i so little to him?? Well.. what really hurts was the words he said.. Its very heart piercing.. And what really really made me damn sad was that when i need frenZ most.. no one was there.. No.. at least yesterday kim thiam actually bother to come down and acco me watch movie.. But i rejected of cos.. I cant believe that someone who i seldom really talk to actually willing to acco me thru.. Well.. maybe i was a great failure.. I think i starting to learn things.. If you dun wan to be hurt again.. You cant be what u really are.. You had to learn to braver than u are.. I think i will learn this.. I seemed so vulnerable at this point of time.. But i guess i had to be strong now.. Sometimes life better when u are alone.. Going movie alone.. Going out alone.. You get to think.. feel ur innerself.. I used to think i am very lucky to have so many good frenZ, a nice boyfriend, family and a okay studies.. But is it really true? To pple, some may envy me.. But looking at what i went through is it real? Nah.. like i say.. Many pple said love is like magic, but it can also be illusion.. Everyone love magic.. While watching.. u believe its real.. But only the magician himself noe its not real.. they are illusion.. i really faced lots of things.. Sometimes i really need somone there.. sit with me.. cried with me.. but who will it be??? well.. i guess in this world the word "best fren" maybe does not ever exist.. Often in time.. most will say never mind i was not there but my heart was.. But does it occur to that person.. Your existance now and then make a large difference? I guess believing that u lead a good life actually jus make u hurt more.. I think my world collapsing.. And today onward.. I WILL BE A TOTALLY NEW ME! will it ever make it? No one noe.. but i try..

      Actually.. I dun really noe this post is for who to see or what.. Jus like to pour my feelings at this v moment to someone.. Maybe the best listener would be this computer liao.. HaiZz.. life sucks.. Sometimes i really dunno who to talk to.. Who exactly will understand my feelings.. Friends? Boyfriend? Family members? But at this very moment when i need someone to be there.. i find no one.. Maybe my circle of frens are jus too small.. Suddenly i really feel pity for myself.. For that.. i cant even find someone to pour my problems to...Haha.. Today then i noe e feelings that pple said.. Words can actually hurt someone deeply... Yah.. a few careless words actually can pierce someone heart so deep..esp when e person mean so much to you.. What make it worst is you had to act as if u are very strong when u are feeling v v sad.. Haha.. i am so "fortunate" today to actually receive this feeling from 2 diff person.. Haha.. But its good in a way that i get to experience diff kind of feelings and learn things from it.. Maybe.. maybe... i should not had fall so deep.. so deep..Well.. I guess that's life.. Now i am starting to believe in retribution.. Haha..

                  “  如果我还有一天寿命，那天我要做你女友。                 我还有一天的命吗？..没有。                 所以，很可惜。我今生仍然不是你的女友。                  如果我有翅膀，我要从天堂飞下来看你。                 我有翅膀吗？..没有。                 所以，很遗憾。我从此无法再看到你。                  如果把整个浴缸的水倒出，也浇不熄我对你爱情的火焰。                 整个浴缸的水全部倒得出吗？..可以。                 所以，是的。我爱你...  This is what i had recently read in the internet.. Its abt a very romantic love story.. But its very long..  http://user1.7host.com/garnet/book/story/long/first/first.htm

      It's pretty late already and I still cant sleepZz.. HaiZz, had been trying to learn to upload pics into this Blog thing..Anyway while i was uploading pic.. I look thru many of the pics.. And it really brought back memories of my past.. Like my recently Sec Sch and Primary Sch gathering.. Well.. Everyone change ALOT!! And everyone seems grown up.. Then thought of those sec sch days where we used to hang around LOT 1,CCKSS... Haha.. Thought of those day where ka and i went to Library to disturb "Snorlax" , putting staples under "Snorlax" sits and he ran around like crazy with the broom!! And the time where we secretly eat sweet even lollypot in class.. Ya.. Not forgetting we shot rubberbands at Mdm Wong and then act innocent... And during CCKSS Anniversary where i first get hugged by sOmEoNe.. And a long walk to LOT 1 without shoes..rEaLlY cant believe that i am so naughty with u guys.. Ya.. and the best and most successful trick that i ever done is to wrap Chilli Sauce inside the tissue and Huiping go and wipe her face...Today, i went out with yingZ.. Well.. heard abt her problems in NJC, really find that she grown up.. But then she is still the same, my best buddy.. We talk a lot, frenZ,sch,CCK days.. Haha.. cant imagine that our friendship can still be so strong after going through so much.. Oh yah.. We ate pasta mania.. Oh gosh.. The chessy pasta super cheesy... TOO CHEESY!!! Haha.. Actually today though the time we hang out together was short yet i still can feel the strong bond btw us.. Maybe its because of what we went through last 2years ago that made us treasure each other so much ba.. Haha..

      Well.. Its pretty late at nite already and i had a pretty long day today! Of cos i attended sch in the morning and met Ceyi after that.. Then i had a nice chat with Huiping and Jaslin.. It really seemed like very long since we had a nice chat.. I really cant believe that Huiping actually converted to a Christian! Well.. i had nothing to say but i cant imagine that the one who used to tell me that she believe in Buddhism and even quarrel with Jaslin over this issue actually converted now!! HaiZz.. Today while chatting with Huiping, i suddenly found that only within 2weeks we didnt seen each other, she changed.. I dunno how to say it but jus feel kinda disappointed when she told me she cant meet me tml.. Actually kinda look forward to meeting her.. Still remember that we used to meet to chat abt our lives, thoughts but things seemed to changed... Oh yah.. i just read a book called FlyingDance.. Very romantic and sweet.. Really gave me a lot of thoughts.. In this book, it said abt a phrase in Titanic which really touch my heart that is:"Rose, listen to me.. Listen... Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.. It bought me to you... And i'm thankful... Rose... I'm thankful..." Well suddenly i start questioning myself that how many times in life that we ever told someone we love that we are thankful that we get to meet them? Well for me i am just someone who dun really noe how to express myself thru words... And often i live in regret in many things.. I simply let opportunity bypass me...But that's jus me rite? Haha.. today i oso gain alot of knowledge! I read some books in the library and actually found that the story TROY is a real story and i am so impressed these ancient civilisation.. I really a little of Julius Cesar and Alexander the great and was really impressed by these 2 men.. Oh ya.. i oso saw picture on Paris.. Wow.. its so beautiful.. Haha.. when i married, i am going to Paris for my honeymoon.. That's my dream.. I loved to dream.. Dream about someday being a teacher, being a businesswomen.. And then married.. Wearing a glass slippers jus like Cinderalla.. Actually i really hope for a fairy tale love.. It doesnt had to last but i just hope it occur once in my life time..

Really feel that life seems so perfect yet i feel so empty inside.. What am i going through now? I remembered reading a book saying.. its good to be waiting..u may feel disappointed in the end.. But at least there's something for u be worth waiting and feeling disappointed.. Haha.. so true yet so.. Hahaha.. i hate waiting.. i dun like waiting.. I hate the feeling of disappointment..

       Oei... actually today i just get back my geography papers... Oh wow.. i was the top in class.. and my grade is jus a B and i am top in class? Kinda have a little shock.. But frankly speaking the results i get from this midyear... am i dreaming or what? It wasnt such a big fuss abt BCC. But i just feel that i didnt really studied... The effort i put in was little.. almost minimum.. yet i deserve doing better than pple?Yeah i studied but i had to admit.. i studied only subjects that i have interest in.. Then y i get those result? Jus pondering.. was God going to made me believe that when there's a will.. there's a way... Yeah i starting to believe in what u sow is what u get.. Hahaa...yeah.. got to start studying early.. 'cos i dun wanna let the teachers down.. I noe that mr osman had really put in effort in our geo.. For i remembered that time... the disappointment i saw in his face when i did badly for my test and sort of cheat with Eileen... Guess the looks will stayed in my heart... forever... Was this midyr really a test for my true ability? i dunno.. i jus noe.. i am afraid.. i wont do as well in midyr.. Every teacher seemed to change their views on me.. I am afraid.. deep down.. i let them down.. I am so afraid... i cant reach my goals.. But i remembered from the book "7effective ways of a teens".. It helped me when i thought i cant go on...i remembered the habits poem... Sometimes.. i will wonder..was that book a turning point of my life? i dunno.. But i noe something for sure.. it change my view, my personality and my life forever... Haha.. Life so strange isnt it?

      Wow.. am so happy today.. Finally i passed my MATHS!!! Erm.. maybe ba.. kinda disappointed abit still cos i see the paper.. SO MUCH careless.. shld have gotten a B but a C would be great liao.. Cant believe that i can actually score a C.. Remembering last year mid yr a F.. promo i got a 0 and CA another 0.. now i can actually jump to C was a really big jump le ba.. erm.. just now mr teo asked me infront of the whole class how i made the jump.. well.. i dunno how to ans.. but jus said it was cos of statistics i did quite okay.. but actually well.. i think it shld be said.. luck + work ba.. erm.. if ask if i have studied hard.. my ans is NO.. but if asked.. have i studied YES.. so that's what studied and didnt studied difference.. Now den i understand a concept... If i studied.. i can pass jus like anyone.. But actually after i pass my math.. i start to believe.. if i study i can do well.. there's nothing called impossible le...as for geo i havent get back.. but feel like its xiong duo ji shao le.. haiZzz.. but.. i shld be contented that at the very least...i tried to do my maths well.. geo if i really do badly.. i shld said.. its all because i really slack.. spend a day to study and expect to do well.. chinese A worst.. i studied yet i interpret Qn wrongly... But now am wondering.. Am i really find excuses for getting bad result?? Hahaha.. actually now den i understand something.. if u keep on finding excuses for bad result ultimately.. U wont do anything and then.. things jus keep on with excuses.. So i guess i shld learn something...BAD=YOUR OUR THINKINGS...  You noe what? i do maths jus because i wan to do it and i stop all those thinkings of bad result.. I guess after i do math i really fall for it.. Like Geography(which i like since sec 3) i learnt to love it.. Chinese was always my greatest love though my greatest fear... HAHAHA.. Things really change le ba.. Hopefully when i get back my result on mon.. i passed all... with flying colors thought chances are slim.. BUT everything started from chances isnt it? why give up a chance though its slim? Talking abt other things.. Suddenly feel very fortunate.. There's so much pple around me who cared abt me.. There's Huiping.. really wanna thx her a lot.. She really did alot to help me.. remembering that day when i thought i flunk my maths.. she give me her greatest encouragement.. Though she didnt said much actually.. BUT her existance does make so much diff.. She give me the courage to get on.. And oso.. Ceyi.. He's been there every now and then.. Though sometimes maybe disappointed.. But he really help..Buy food at nite for me, encouragement,... there's too much.. Guess.. life getting better.. hahhaa

      Have you ever wake up feeling very scared? Well.. today that's my feeling..HaiZz.. got a bita flu and then i suddenly wake up remembering.. i havent done studied for the pass few days... Everyone seems to be sprinting and i am stopping.. That kind of feeling really sucks! How i wish i could turn back the time and enjoy my sec sch life... With my frenZ enjoying every single moment.. Mr Siraj had say its like ur end is doomed if u screwed up ur As... Then i feel so lost these few days... Sometimes i dun see the word HOPE in my dictionary... Everyone tell me i can make it.. But.. i doubt myself.. Really feel like gg for a run.. cycling.. Oh yeah.. my promise for ceyi last time.. Actually wanna say i really dunno how to control my diet.. But i dunno wat happening to me.. I eat alot when i get stressed up.. I really dunno how to relieve myself.. Thats the first time i fear something so much.. For O level, u can either go poly or JC... But for As? You only got one choice.. Go University or die.. HaiZz.. life sucks big time!!!

Someone who i had little contact actually thought of me like that?What's my value??? Jus feel that i am a really a failure.. And i even dunno how to do a simple maths sum!!! Yeah.. Hahaha.. very funny rite?? U noe wat? All the pressure, stress over friendship, love, studies making me crazy.. I really start to understand y it 18 yr old is a difficult yr..

      heyZ.. haha.. so long didnt write liao.. Actually today was really a wasted day.. I spent my day pondering about things.. Yesterday i went to my click outing.. Things really turned out bad.. Yeah.. Yunling that gal she really angered me to the extreme.. I never thought i would hate someone to the extreme.. U noe what? Well.. at first she bbq a chicken fillet then i took half of it.. Then u noe what?? When she continue to bbq another, i asked her to help me bbq and then she say i ate a lot!!! Yeah.. Oh pls.. pple ate more than me k?? What really angered me more is that Eileen already at 2 and she asked her to bbq one more than Yunling called her faster come and take if not i will eat up!! Wa liao.. am i really that gullible??? KaoZzz... So i didnt ate anymore chicken fillet and went home early!!! I really hate that gal!! I swear i going to go on diet and do very well for my A level.. For i noe she wanna compete with me.. Okie lor.. If that's the way she want things to be.. then i will compete with her till the end... Well pple say if there's something which can motivate u.. U will strive.. is this a form of motivation? i dunno but i noe i have one goal.. To win no matter what.. Oh yeah.. Forget abt that damn gal.. Actually today.. i went thru a lot of things.. I read yingZ diary.. I sit down to feel... I start asking myself what life is abt? Is it abt studying for students? Am i born just to achieve goals pple set for me? Am i alway going to follow my sis footsteps? Do you noe what? I had constantly being stress.. Everyone expect good results from me.. Everyone expect me going thru my sis footsteps.. But.. Have anyone asked what i want? I wan a life.. Diff from my sis.. During pri sch everyone expected me to go Swisscottage.. During Sec sch pple expect me to go JJC... But has anyone noe.. I had tried so hard to achieve those goals? Do you noe how i feel when i get back my PSLE when i was P6 when i saw those disappointment in my parents? No one understand.. Do you noe how i hate pple the 2nd daughter in the family? Now.. A level.. Everyone expected me to do as well as my sis.. Do u understand the stress? My teachers expected me to do well for my A level for my aggregate is 12 for my L1R5... But.. do u noe abt the constant stress i get??? Sometimes i wonder... Y cant i born in some other countries like USA.. where everyone can study in University.. I like studying but i dun like route learning..  Education= memorising.. Is this what the govt want to achieve?? And oh yeah.. how to i get motivated? Haha.. really feel like walking down Orchard Road watching a movie.. Enjoying the night breeze... But is it possible now? You noe wat? When i went out for more than 3hr to somewhere to walk.. I feel guilty.. I feel scared.. Cos everyone studying and i was jus.. idling.. Its so scary.. Time so little.. I feel.. i feel.. so insecure.. Scared.. I feel so useless.. To be exact.. I am overstress.. I have to go on diet and then.. do well in study.. Is it possible? Why is everyone putting pressure on me?? Me going crazy liao!!!
