       urlLink Alternative Remedies Gaining Popularity (washingtonpost.com)   Its just alarming to see that in a country as literate as the US, 36% are using alternative medicine. I just cant imagine the percentage in India.  Now, am not biased enuf to say it is completely useless. Surely, am a free market guy, hence more competition, better services.. literally.:)  but the problem i have is, there is absolutely no control over these drugs and 'docs'.   The MCI keeps a tight collar around Allopathic practitioners, but these alternative docs are literally free. There is no central testing authority that conducts analysis of their outrageous miracle cures. If anyone who cares to watch their shows on almost all tamil channels, miracle healers have cropped up like a locust storm. They cure anything and everything that affects mankind. All diseases A-Z. They advertise themselves as one stop multi specialty health care centers. I wonder when will ppl realize this is utter nonsense, at least that one man cant be a specialist in everything. Cmon, he cant treat brain tumours and at the same time treat psoriasis and other utterly unrelated diseases. And yet, none of the TVs which broadcast these shows seem to have the sense or responsibility towards society.  Prayer and Religion in Healthcare is acceptable, that too only to an extent as long as it doesnt interfere with treatment and recuperation. They have strong psychological effects on humans, a placebo of sorts.  But this alternative stuff, how many AM medicine docs will advise a patient to get off 'english' anti-hypertensive medicines and go for kuligais and potions they concoct? And will someone sane enuf do that? Yes, doctors in allopathy, do recommend some herbal alternatives. But thats not done word-of-mouth style. These recommendations are based after objective analysis of data derived from experiments.  Another thing u must notice is how the material is presented. I havent seen till now one AM doc on TV how his treatment actually works. Very Strange indeed. If they are so sure of their record, why not publish it or announce in TV, on how exactly their medicine acts. What they think is the disease's cause and what exactly are they doing by prescribing certain diets/pills etc and how these medications help in relieving the patient? To put it bluntly, Mechanism of Action. Everyone just claims, they cure this and they cure that. And i go yawn....... havent heard that one before.   Even funnier, Most of these docs actually have balls to criticise Allopathy when they cant say with a straight face on what their treatment entails. Sometimes, they give out such misleading information which can result in only one thing, filling of their pockets. Theres one idiot from Salem with a serious 'holier-than-thou' complex, and he considers himself a seventh generation sexologist. Self appointed of course. He declares he is there to give sevai and not for money.and all tamil nattu pongaL are his pongaL. Yeah, right. Wonder, how these idiots were allowed to live for dispensing and creating havoc among the sexually illiterate youth of TN. I watched the other day with seething anger, almost to the point of 'nothing can be done' frustration, when he was blabbing about impotency. By Gosh, u need to be imaginative seriously to come up with reasons like he does. Utter incompetent fool with apparently minimal knowledge on human reproductive system, and he is proud to come on TV. Best is, his service is so essential, he goes to every town in TN to give sevai.   Another major buffoon is this guy from Chennai. He claims to have heritage of asthana vaidya salai for some royal household.  Please have a look at his roster of services. Let us ignore the spelling errors, though I have a doubt that he doesnt really know or care, as long as words sound scary. Coz his TV prog also consistently mis-spells and this continues here too in his website.

        After that serious post on politics, heres something lighter.. movie reviews  First off,  Kamaraj ..  This is quite an old movie.. I cudnt quite catch the titles since, am sorry, this was in VCD!  Premise: A movie about "Karuppu Gandhi" Kamarajar. The movie is a biographical account of the leader from his early days to his death.  Review: Individual Events in the movie need not be and cannot be reviewed as such since they are real historical events. The movie has a cut & paste effect of various scenes done in that manner, looking quite disjointed. Probably, the director was hoping for this effect. But i can live with it, since we r concerned abt history and not a 'story'. Retelling 60 years is not easy and the director can be forgiven for the above flaw.  Mathabadi, acting-wise, the guy they chose to play lead is good. His voice-over is by MS Bhaskar of "Chinna Pappa" fame, i think. This guys good. Other actors seem stone faced. Not much acting, probably amateurs. Especially, the lady who plays Indra Gandhi. She suffers from facial paralysis.  But the history holds up the movie.   Worth watching if we need to increase our vayetherichal on the present state of TN politics. Only stale acting is a let down.  ------------  Another movie, I watched was  Jana .  One word: Dont!  Ajith has gone mad, and is probably having hallucinations about his status in the film world. Dont watch it unless u want to endure this as an Ajith fan. Pathetic copy&paste story. Ajith with his non-sensical one liners, as if he were Rajnikant. I dont know when Tamil Actors will get it to their heads that only the Super Star can give one-liners and get away with it. Others, look lame. Thats the only effect they achieve. Sneha is not needed for this role. Radharavi, local villain is forgotten as soon as the intl. terrorist villain arrives. Police Inspector Delhi Ganesh turns PA to Ajith. Lots of holes in this movie as mentioned with only Srividhya doing well.  Rest are wasted.   Ajith, better for him to get into motor racing, though he is not doing terribly good there as well, and spares us his non-sense. Red, Citizen, Anjaneya and now this. Pathetic.    ------------ Meanwhile, a delightful little movie i watched.  Adithadi . No time to write a review. But one word: Must-See. Quite funny with trademark Sathyaraj Lollu all over. It has logical flaws but the movie more than makes it up in humor dept.

      Been already a week.. since i wrote here..   time flies so fast. indeed..   And Manmohan has been our PM for one week now. Which is already some milestone, judging by the way these power hungry idiots who he has for allies. below i post an earlier message i had written at a discussion forum. Just like i had wished, Sonia decided to step aside for Manmohan and wants to control from behind the scenes.. This though, is clearly a selfish decision to boost her moral authority, ppl and the silly media have mistakenly termed this renunciation. Far from it in my opinion. Her silly act back when she lied to the President about 272 MPs backing her and her demenour until the fateful day when she stepped out show she was as power hungry as anyone but only she regained her senses. now to the post.  Jaya has suffered a colossal defeat, yes but she has been known to recover tremendously. So we cant count her out yet.  But really, apart from the media hype with some amount of truth in it on her high-handedness in adminstration, I dont see her any different from mu.ka who is just as corrupt, if not more and morally bankrupt. To call him oppurtunistic will be an understatement, as can be known from his famous (though these have started to become a bit retarded of late with his recent 'pakistan zindabad' dumb story) quips, that they were testing waters for 4 years under BJP led NDA rule with ministers in the cabinet. Am sorry, for a seasoned politician like him, I expect at least a better excuse. Suddenly BJP became madhavadha arasu after the DMK had stuck as parasites to power for most of the rule and quit before elections based on policies. For Gujarat carnage which was indeed a black mark, however pointing the entire blame upon Sangh Pariwar is a bit biased in my humble opinion. The other community in question had its share of blame too. Be that as it may, Mu.Ka, had he quit at the time, we cud have believed he was making a statement, but he conveniently chose to stick with BJP.  Interestingly, RSS has issued a statement saying BJP has forgotten Hindutva and hence failed. The Oppn saying BJP is essentially too much hindutva and hence failed to woo secular indian masses. Which is true, I wonder. In TN, of course the evidently secular Muslim League is a partner in the 'secular' democratic progressive alliance of dmk. wah...  Coming to TN, as much as i loathe jaya and mu.ka, I personally give slighter preference to Jaya, just for her dealing with Govt. Employees. As much as she can be arrogant, sure the raw force she showed in clamping down the strike, put those buffoons in their places. Over-rated, Under-working, corrupt fools that mostly seem to make up our govt. machinery. Anyone who has gone recently to get even a LLR or to sort out a problem with ur local EB/Water dept. will vouch for this am sure. These long time trade union cancer has plagued India ever since her independence and in my opinion, more than who rules, its these corrupt janta thats responsible for the state we r in.. pitiable state, fyi. What happened? They went silent and fell on their knees within a couple of days.   The Labour belligerence is more due to antiquated labor laws which need much reform, though this is not going to happen at least until those dreaded communists and their comrades are removed from power. At present, as Frank Wisner put it, Indian labour laws simplified: You can hire, but u cant fire. So much for progress.  Let me be clear, am not saying govt workers cannot demand rights. Sure. They can. But let them work first. Let them earn their privileges.  So, thats that. I doubt terms like productivity and efficiency are even known to these ppl. But hey, u cant privatize loss making PSUs, becoz its not populist. Surely, way to go India!  As for anti-conversion law, some ppl here are raking it up more than wat its worth. Rights guaranteed by our constitution are not denied, as mistakenly or intentionally miscontrued by some here. Only Conversions based on monetary benefits are prohibited. Am not sure whats wrong with that.  Cancellation of subsidies etc are long-term decisions, that are not populist but indeed help us in reducing our deficit. Sure, these hard decisions may mean she has at least a long term policy (Which i doubt though). Yes, we have poor in the millions and they needed to be tended to. Developed countries have social compensation programmes, but we r not rich enuf to devote our money in the military and needless populist policies. We r not a developed country, at least yet at any rate. Deepening our deficits and loans is not the right way to becoming one either. Alternate policies are needed. What they r, if u ask, is beyond me, and is for the over paid department guys to sort out.   Coming to Ration Card with 'H' symbol, I think again it was a hard long term decision. The same ppl who wud have jumped up to type flame for my previous paragraph, wud but have to agree with me here. If u earn more than a certain amount of money, I think its 5000Rs., which is way way more than the poorest of the poor earn, for whom India is not shining apparently, Surely u must be able to afford to feed ur family. If u cannot, too bad, u must consider switching to a better job, or cut down ur expenses. Coz, we r a poor nation and only can afford so much to protect our poor, who definitely need the rice and rations. Not middle class and lower middle class income groups, who r affluent under indian conditions, and who can afford convent education for their children, mobile phones and bikes. Sorry, Give me one reason why u must get rations in subsidized prices. One Reason, please.  Kaveri issue and water problem indeed are partly due to failure of monsoons and lack of foresight. Indeed, Its a failure. Somehow, Jaya is held responsible for the entire debacle. Mu. Ka and his pet SUN conveniently forget it was he, Mu. Ka who withdrew the case from SC to get into the good books of Indra. And Jaya being no better, with her arrogance has brought nothing forward.  As for Jaya. She deserves to go. So does mu. ka. His rule has not been the golden period of TN as his pet SUN TV likes to emphasize with the sycophant Malan in place. His track record in violence and corruption is first-rate and is of the highest quality with only Jaya trailing behind him. For Stalin, well, so far he has proven to be a great successor to his father at least in areas of crime.  Next comes, our docutter Ramados, CEO of the Official Forest-Clearing Party of TN. PMK indeed is one party thats pragmatic enuf to have a minister in every govt that forms in the center. They have taught tamilians how to cut trees, burn buses and horse-trade. Other than that, nothing substantial except Caste based bull emanating from thailapuram, and sadly ppl seem to buy it still. AK Moorthy was the only notable exception in this gypsy clan.  Vaiko is energetic indeed. But, with a big BUT, he supports terrorists. They fight for our so-called brothers of Tamil Eelam or not is not the issue. They kill innocent ppl, they r terrorists. Period. No matter what they do and what their cause is. Arafat has a cause. Bin Laden has a cause and so evidently does Prabhakaran. And if someone says he offers support to such ppl and openly admits to having visited the terrorists indeed, I leave the option of judgement to Tamilians. They, until now seem to think its ok to have friendship with LTTE and like minded guerillas. Hopefully they will learn their lesson soon. (digression: Mu. Ka casually spoke in his press. conf of repealing POTA. Am not sure he is aware of what the world is going through in the hands of terrorists due to such lethargic policies. And with our easy to ignite communal flame, which is already seeing 'fellow brothers' coming to fight for "The Cause" from as far as Chechnya, Afghanistan, Central Asian Republics and even the UK, will anyone sane enuf speak of repealing the POTA?)  Who else is there in Tamil Nadu? GK Vasan, tis going to be a hard time fighting internal politics of COngress in TN, so i highly doubt he is ever going to be in contention for managing TN as Chief Minister.  The Rise of Thirumavalavan and Krishnaswamy signal the alarming levels to which our democracy has stooped. Lower than Mettur Dam, that is. More buffoons, for ur private entertainment.  Rajinikant voice kodukkave romba yosikkirar. Atchikku vandha, endha prechnainalum yesnum sollale, nonnum sollale sollitu imayamalai poiduvar. adhukkule 5 varusham mudichidum.   Only BJP is left, and they r not even in the race as far as TN is concerned.  The Big Picture of course is in the center, as much as the coterie of Sonya would like to claim this election as a mandate to congress, it s absolutely not; if we step back a little to observe. Congress wudnt have improved much on their earlier tally if not for massive failure of the BJP in AP and TN, and these states they lost again due to state-level anti-incumbency than anything to do with indians pouring in the millions into the election booths to make sure Sonia became PM, like they wish to project. Sonia, if only she had a more analytical mind, wud clearly have not opted to be PM. For whatever she does, good or bad, her motives are going to come to question. She wud have been better off being the sidelines controlling than blatantly ascending the PM-ship, much to the humiliation of many Indians, if not felt now, will be realized in the years to come.   Whos going to be in 2006? Unless, the EC announces its purported 'None of the Above' option in the EVM, we have to live with one of these people. R.I.P, Tamil Nadu.   ---- Note: 3 very significant things have happened in the days after this piece was written.. 1) Jaya withdrawing all her reformist policies in one blanket statement. This in my opinion is very bad in the long term. All these now gone policies were good things to do, in the future interests of the state. Now Jaya withdrawing has done significant damage, at least wrt me, who considered her to be more staunch in policy and expected her to remain steadfast to these reforms. Nothing comes for free, and Manmohan has essentially said the same in his earlier FM stint.   2) More proof emerged for Mu. Ka's policy and political maturity rather immaturity. He was yapping all along about his party not being in there for power, which was a good ploy to get good ministries. Then cheap kuzhayadi sandai style statement when he wasnt offered the berths he reqd. I am curious to know, if DMKs ministers can only function in certain ministries? The obvious blaring reason staring in our face is his apparent intent to plunder public money. Nothing else. Whats a good ministry and a not so good ministry. Also he may wish to continue TR Baalu style politics to constantly nag Jayas govt. The pinnacle of mu.kas cheap politics is Dayaniti Maran's cabinet post. Its simply astonishing that he is still not satisfied even after Sonia offered a Cabinet berth to Dayanithi, on the sole qualification that he is mu.kas relative, despite being absolutely a novice to politics. His career so far being involved in maintaining SCV in Chennai. And he gets cabinet. When even veterans in congress are MoS. What about Scindia, Jiten Prasad and most prominently Rahul Gandhi. Even he has stayed out of power. But mu.kas main ambition seems to be power and the money that comes with it.  3) If u thought mu. ka was bad, think of our docutter. His son is not even an MP! For Gods sakes, this is just outrageous stuff. All his previous promises of his kin will not hold any govt office went down the drain. Anbumani, a doctor by education, though has not even faced an election. Well, u may say, so is Manmohan Singh, but one look at his CV will silence his critics on this issue at least. But Anbumani.. please..

         Perazhagan    Cast : Surya, Vivek, Jothika, Manorama, Bobby  Director : Sasi Sankar  MD : Yuvan Shankar Raja  DP : Rathnavelu   Perazhagan(My translation is ok here i think: Greatly Handsome Man!)  has been touted as "kuzhandaigaludan pakka vendiya padam"(to be seen with children) produced by the venerable AVM. Does it live up? Read On. I dont plan to go scene by scene. Rather, i intend to focus on performance and fallacies in plot etc. So this is intended as a critique (well, ho ho, I like the seriousness of this word).  The Premise: On one hand, There is this disfigured Chinna(Surya) who earns his bread on his own. He falls in love with a blind street-entertainer Sembagam (Jothika). On the other, a very belligerent, boxer Karthik(Surya) and his lover Priya (Jothika). In a tragic circumstance, Priya is killed. her eyes are transplanted onto Sembagam. The question s will the now-seeing Jothika reject Chinna the disfigured..  On to the review: The whole of Tamil press has gone mad. At least their movie critics department. Thats my opinion. Am sure you may concur or differ. But as far as I see, one of their main criteria for judging a movie's worth is their inclusion of some disfigured character or psychopaths. Take the example of Pithamagan. A loose psychopathic story with much blood and gore, but Vikram plays this retarded character and the press go 'wow'. I have a personal distaste for Vikram, much since his over acting in Kaasi (we know our hero is blind, but surely he is not retarded. Also Vikram emoted generously large tics 24/7 which i think was the one that put me off). One of the most retarded performances I have seen but tamil makkal think not so. This minor Tics condition of Vikram developed into an alarming full-blown Tourettes syndrome in Pithamagan. Anyways: thats old story. Here the same again..  Am not sure Surya got it into his mind that Chinna is only physically dysfigured and  not  mentally retarded. The dialogues by themselves convey a very modern guy but Surya's actions/dialogue delivery portray a slightly retarded person. Its all over the film to see. He behaves normally at times but suddenly jumps all over and behaves like a buffoon in general. Whether Surya took this for something comic will be interesting to know. For instance, Like how he applies talc all over his cheeks. This is taken for comedy I suppose, unfortunately I find this rather irritating than anything funny. Clearly the Chinna character though vibrant and happy-go-lucky as it is, isnt retarded and is quite world-wise enuf. It doesnt need circus antics to draw audience as demonstrated at other times during the movie: we see quite evidently the quick verbal wit displayed by the same character. So surya, in his excitement, has probably gone a bit towards the overacting arena. That said, he shines at certain moments. When he tells Vivek of the long dead son of Manorama in Dubai; When he finally pays the bill for Jothika's operation. Overall an average performance. Do let me know, if am wrong or indeed Surya has 're'defined acting as some rags are writing.  The Second Surya Karthik is a ghost without a serious sensible character. Created more out of curiosity than necessity in my opinion. He looks slick and rides a bike. He attacks viciously like a trained dog at anyone and everyone. Be it, his father or a goonda. Anybody speaks, they get thrashed. Thats more or less the Common Minimum Programme of Karthik here. Pretty irrational for a guy to be of such sorts especially considering middle class background that he is from. Lets forget that fact. So he is a wild in-your-face guy and he is in love with the local police chief's daughter. And guess what, heres where the story starts to lose its focus and we can see the director has tried to be novel and lost track.   We watch with bated breath as an apparently incompetent Police father watches in silence, when Surya gate crashes to his house during Jothika's bethrothal. God knows, when our movie makers are going to get over this wild fantasy. Then, as JJ put it, vedikkayilum vedikkai, Jothika goes into a deep forest, that  mysteriously  appears in the middle of the city/village (I almost forgot, i cant figure out for the life of me where this story takes place. Slick houses/offices/college and boxing arena on one side/gramathu veedu/cane othai-palam/huge lake that too with water on the other. If anyone can tell where such a location exists, my next vacation is there.) and lame plot here, has to go alone there. What reaction Chinna wud have displayed against Varadha, the villain at this juncture (a classic Damsel In Distress situation), would have been interesting when previously he accepted he was being thrashed and didnt want anymore problems. So Chinna could have stayed with Jothika and stood against: that wud have at least added an Jatayu dimension to this thing. Also, in true formulaic tamil cinema, Karthik waits in an abandoned mine/quarry sort of place for Jothika. Why, I have no idea. Our hero was gutsy enuf to gate-crash into the Police Chief's house at mid-day. Why not try the same and elope with ur girl? At least meet her in a neutral area (read: park, cafe) where people are there for company than Asking her to come to woods,(possibly fraught with snakes and other not so friendly creatures), with someone physically disabled. Wait, u thought that was funny. What happens afterwards is even funnier. Surya exhibited a visceral, almost maniacal love towards Priya. She Dies. What will u expect him to do? He gets even more maniacal, to the extent of psychopathic, and pursues Sembagam. Coz Sembagam has Priya's eyes. SOrry have to hand it to the director, Cant get lamer than that. Then in the end, with one drop of tear from Sembagam fleeing from the villain, Surya abandons his villainy, his projected demented psychopath image in a snap literally and becomes goody goody buddy to our hero Chinna. Surya is slick and handsome. But the plot fails him here. Miserable Characterization.  Jothika.. Reviewing Jothika's acting is always easy, coz she doesnt do much, hence we dont have to write much. The story continues here too. Absolutely pathetic chuckle and head-jerks and eye-brow crunch, her trademarks. Its Ridiculous some call this acting and boohoo, she has more money than i DO! My Hate for Jothika is as visceral as Karthik'a love for Priya. So thats that. She cant Act. When will the producers get this thing into their heads is beyond me. Many magazines say they saw a new side to Jothika's acting in her portrayal of Sembagam. As with heroes' obsession for overacting and physical disfiguration, our heroines are obsessed with no make-up acting. The term 'no make up' alone can get instant dinamani dinathanthi awards, guaranteed. Sadly, as was Laila's annoying Pithamagan character, here does Jothika. The Same Steretyped Jothika-ic expressions I have come to hate. I think Surya Jothika currently are top tabloid material and hence she was chosen than for anything else. There maybe a personal bias here, but guys be fair,  she cant act .  Manorama, in her usual self, but sparing us the naan petha rasa of the past, does admirably here. She is good especially in the scene where Chinna lies about her son in Dubai. Others do their stuff well. The Villain is some guy called Bobby (havent seen him before) and he looks like he will not be out of place in reality as well. Such are his looks. The Police Chief is played by this quite popular actor though i forget his name. He is capable of doing more, but is dumbed down here to accomodate Karthik'a antics.  We finally come to one character thats worthwhile in the whole movie. Kuzhandai a.k.a marriage assembler played by Vivek. Viveks all blazing guns right from the start. Ppl are upset about his jokes on disfigurement. Though i dont find it offensive, since he is not discriminating as such and plays compassionate buddy to Chinna at times of his need. So, he takes liberty at taking pot shots. Which is fine by me. Real corwd pleasing performance. My favorite is the young guy who details his natchathiram etc and asks him to find a girl; when Chinna returns after meeting thalavasal vijay (yes tis guy also here but dies too quickly) and the best is the night scene with all of CHinna's household decides on his marriage. Great going Vivek.  Yuvan Shankar Raja is truly back in form with vague songs and tunes. Exception being Ambuli Mama: sounds nice but the visuals, mainly Chinna's circus put me off.  Rathnavelu does his stuff as always. I wasnt too fond of his work in Jeyam but here he is quiet in the background. But he cud have advised the director to fix on one clear-cut 'in story location'!   Ultimately: cud have been a good movie, if Surya had delivered a more balanced performance and the director had stuck with one Chinna.. A confused Karthik character is not needed if the main focus is on Chinna/Sembagam. Another major grips is simply the amount of violence, mostly unnecessary and formulaic, in this movie. Am not sure, children of TN can be shown such stuff, but the censors think this its ok.  Cant get more than 6 out of 10 and that too vivek takes a major credit in this.
