      Ummm......i dont know what to type.......but i feel i should type somthing soo......Straight Edge is not an internet phenomenon. It does not exist so that you can have something cool to call yourself by. Straight Edge did not distance itself from hardcore. Straight Edge does not exist seperately from any musical scene. Straight Edge is hardcore. It is about the music. It is about the fellowship and it is about being drug free. Don't fool yourself into thinking differently. You're not straight edge if you have no idea how it feels to be in a pit, arm outstretched, fingerpointing, and singing along with a straight edge anthem. I honestly can't imagine having no clue how amazing that feels. To feel connected to the scene, the music the people. "to be a part of something real". If you've never felt it, then you have no idea. It's like knowing the theory but not the practice. Straight edge is an active thing. It's not something you stop being and come back to. You are not straight edge if you have no connection. You are not straight edge if you've never been to a show. if you've never bought a record. If you hate hardcore. And do all of us that love this scene, the music and this way of life a favor, keep it alive. Keep it alive by being apart of it. By being a consumer. By attending shows, buying merch and records. Independent and DIY bands need and deserve your money, so keep that in mind the next time you're downloading MP3's. MP3's are great ways to hear bands and to get an idea of whether or not you like them. If you like them, support them. Buy their product. It's because of them and bands before them that Straight Edge has lasted as long as it has and without them hardcore and Straight Edge will both die.
