      Ok, so tonight will go down as being pretty high on the "shit that was cool" list. So i meet up with Tony, a friend i used to race with back at Cal. He's in the area working for a law firm up in the city but will be going back to NYC to finish in a couple weeks. Solid guy - haven't seen&nbsp;him in a while so we grab dinner in San Jose at a local taqueria and afterwards head over to Gordon Bierch to grab a couple beers. We talk about random shit - school, life, work...then he tells me about the new car he's driving -&nbsp;his dad's&nbsp;year old Ferrari 360 Spyder. I know his dad's pretty well off being the CFO of Flextronics and all but you would have never guess that by&nbsp;looking at Tony&nbsp;- he was always part of that free love/narcotics experimenting/granola-y society so common to the CO-OP type. I guess people change...So we start talking about his car and after sitting around for a couple hours, he offers to give me a ride around town. Of course i say hell yeah and in a couple minutes, i find myself in the passenger seat of midnight blue 360 with the top down. So we start driving, and mind you, I've never taken the overpass&nbsp;from 280N to&nbsp;880S more than 60mph in my station wagon. So when we hit this thing at 120, i swear i almost shat my pants. With the top down and a screaming V8 behind my head, it was a moment i will never forget. And Tony -&nbsp;who the fuck knew he was such a good driver? Turns out the kid used to race in the Formula Dodge series back in high school and you could tell&nbsp;- he&nbsp;was heel-toeing like the best of them. Anyways, just got back home a minute or two ago and my hands are still shaking. Goddamm that car is fast....   Music playing - Talib Kweli - Get By

      Still not much going on these days except working like a dog on this PSC Demo - finally getting good results after 3 days. These work hours have not been helping the race to 155lbs. Oh well...

      Welcome to my blog - From henceforth my life will unfold before your eyes...  So, I'm starting this blog thing on a bad note - my goddamm sunovabitch 10 year old Audi is gettin some serious service -Engine is leaking oil through the cylinder heads. Head gaskets are also showing drip. Exhaust is completely shot from the second cat back and the rear left CV joint has broken seal - and i just went in to get an electrical problem / muffler fixed...WTF? The wallet is going to be taking a major hit - Can you f*ing believe over 4Gs!!!! Couldn't sleep last night thinking about how insane this bill is going to be. Arrgh...I better get another 100,000 miles from this car or i will be pissed...  Please sir, may i have another? (bending over and grabbing ankles...)  Music: Mos Def - Miss Fat Booty
