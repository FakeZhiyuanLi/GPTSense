       Im not a big fan of politics, in fact I think its the worst subject to talk about (alongside religion and poetry) which are all so beyond subjective its almost imposible to agree on more than one fact. But  urlLink Michael Moore  does make it intereseting (IMO).   Again he's being attacked. And that just makes me want to see his film even more.

       Another moron has decided to create a  urlLink  Rave Site  based out of Puerto Rico. As if we even had raves anymore [if ever]. Also notice how in his profile he states that he loves Reggaeton.... just what all of us ravers (and by now i hope you realize im being sarcastic)  have been wishing for all this time! a Caco to run a Rave website.  its a dream come true.

       Last nite i watched a  urlLink show  on VH1. In it Trey from  urlLink Phish (one of my favourite bands, and Dave Mathews (who needs no introduction) visit Africa to play with Orchestra Baobabs.  I always thought Baobabs refered to the trees on  urlLink ">The Little Prince . I guess it's also a  urlLink http://www.alovelyworld.com/webseneg/htmgb/sen47.htm">tree  in Africa.   To my surprise, the music of Orchestra Baobabs sounds very much like that of the "trios" in Puerto Rico. Their style when they sing, the guitars, the harmonies and melodies...everything ! it was like listening to one of my stepdad's CD's but in French.

       I swear  urlLink this  is almost hipnotizing. And like many of the things i will post here it has no purpose either.   but the tune's a good one.
