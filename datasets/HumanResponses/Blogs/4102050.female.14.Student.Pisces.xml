      I got bored to day and looked back through all the junk sittingon my dresser. I found a bunch of notes, phone numbers, email adresses, and a poem. I wrote the poem a couple months ago and I liekd it then, if you like it tell me so... Well, here it is... It doesn't have a title...  To all my friends I want you to know I love you all So never let go  To all the guys Who said they cared I want you to see How well I've fared  To my family Who I hold so dear I hope to hear from you Year after year  To my best friend Thank you so much I'd of never had fun Without seeing you at lunch  To my best man I love you the most I'd follow you From east to west coast  And to myself I'm glad you're still here I'll comtinue to help you No matter your fear  Well, that is it I hope you liked, If any one actually read this that is.  Well I have to go now. I got soccer practice in about twenty minutes. So, I will talk to you all later.   ♥Jeanne♥

      Is all my life just some big soap opera, where I sit around and listen to my friends complain and argue over their friends and who they like and who they don't and who they are going to talk to. No! I will not take part in any of this. I refuse to be part of their problems in any way. The only thing I will do is be there for them when they need a shoulder to cry on, Give them advice when they need it, and show them that I love them. I wish someone cared about me, listened to my problems the way I listen to theirs. Someone who will do the same for me as I do for them...  I feel hurt to think that my friend thinks that I value winning a competition over her friendship. Well, to tell you the truth Jessica I value our friendship more...  And Tricia pick a guy that you really like and stick to him. One that isn't going to cheat on you, one that you really care about, one that you really want to be with and stay with him, no matter what others think of him or how he acts. There is my advice to you. But since you will never read this why did I even write it.  I find this completely pointless and very relaxing. I think I am goign too call it quits today and go find a spot away from life where I can reflect on everything I said and how it is going to hurt people.  Goodbye.   ♥Jeanne♥

      I think that I need a set of rules. My friends Tricia has some and she says it makes her feel better, so I am going to come up with some rules for me...  1. Be myself as much as possible 2. Smile all that I can 3. Don't get in people's way 4. Tell people what you think of them, if they ask 5. tell the truth when people ask for it 6. Try to be happy with the choices I make, and make the right ones, the ones that will not hurt someone else  I think that is good. That sounds like everything I do wrong, so maybe now I can do stuff right and not hurt people's feelings. I spent the entire day just sitting on the couch reading. Wow! I am tired right now. Well, I am going to leave you to yourself, so that you can come up with some thing else to do besides read my boring posts.  ♥Jeanne♥

      I had a soccer tournament this weekend and then i had to go to dance right after my last game sunday... And if I wasn't tired after soccer, I sure was after dance... Three and a half hours of being on my feet in high heel shoes... We won the first game and then lost the next three... I had fun though. I scored a goal and I got to play everywhere. Except goalie. Then at dance we learned a new dance. And I had so much fun... I am happy right now, so don't do anything to ruin the moment... I am really hot right now... It is like 80 outside... Oh well, I am just talking to my friend Tricia right now. She has been on vacation for the past week. Well, I am a bit exhausted, so I am going to go rest and read.  ♥Jeanne♥

      You know how they say that there is light at the end of the tunnel... I think I relized that the only thing that I have to look forward to is school... And at school, I think, there is a hope for friends and love... Well, I think I will tell you all about me so that you know what kind of person that I am. I have four thing that I love to do in my life. I love to play soccer, I love to read, I love to act, and I really love to dance. I find dance relaxing and enjoyable because my friends are there. I have been dancing for... I think this year will be my seventh year... Yes... I have played soccer for eight, this is my ninth year. I have read books of all sorts since I was five. I have been involved in the school plays since 7th grade. I am a sophmore at my local high school now. School starts in a month... I will enjoy being somewhere that I can be myself... Well, almost my self... The only time I am my self is when I am by myself and no one is there to criticize and judge my actions, call me irresponsible or stupid... Well it is late and I must be going. To anyone who actually read this thank you. It makes me feel... I don't know... I just feel something   ♥Jeanne♥

      This is kinda stupid, but I think it will be a good way to tell someone, even if it just a computer, my feelings. My feelings are everywhere around me... I just can't seem to get rid of then no matter how hard I try... I need something to look forward to once in a while, maybe I just need love or a really good friend... I think already have a couple of good friends... Kimi, she will be a friend all through school, I'd have to say the only friend that I ever told everything to was Kotori... She was my best friend and the only one who knew all my secrets that I ever had. She trusted me and I trusted her, I really miss her to talk to. I switched school districts and now I never get to see her. Trish is probably the person who knows the most about me after kotori... I tell her almost everything also... I dont think I will tell my friends about this website, in fact I think it is best that they don't know about it, since I am likely to write about them... I am talking to Kevin right now and he asked what I was doing, so I told him I was typing and now he wants to know all about it... I don't think I will tell him either... Well, it is time that I got off and went and did something else... See you all later...  ♥Jeanne♥
