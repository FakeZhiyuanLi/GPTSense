      Hello,          Going to the Beach with Zoë today! I have got to pick her up from the Stephen Joseph Theater at 1:30pm! Then tomorrow I’m sleeping at her house so this is the plan of action : Friday: Scarborough Fair. Friday Night: Sleepover! Saturday: Market. Saturday Night: Sleepover again! Sunday: Be really lazy!! Sunday Night: Sleep at dads. Monday: ???  So I’m gonna have a lot of fun! Right now I’m Sat in my garden with the computer ((I’m not on the Internet I wrote this on Microsoft Word first!!)) Sun Bathing and having a rant about Danielle and Kelly! As you know I fell out with Danielle a while ago, But I fell out with Kelly the day before yesterday ((How am I supposed to know what day it was?!?)) I was sat in my Garden minding my own Business (( Hee hee hee!!)) When Melissa, Kelly’s Sister, Came along and said “Kelly says she doesn’t like you any more because you called her a Bitch!” so I said “And….Maybe I did and that’s only because she called me goofy awhile back!” Melissa then said “Well I think you are goofy and you should leave my sissy alone!” Then I said “Melissa maybe I have big teeth but I can fix them but you cant fix your big head!!!” Well personally I think that’s the best comment I have come up with all month!!!  Any ways got to go,                  Bye x x x

      Hey,       I slept really well last night because we went to the cinema to see Sherk 2! It was really funny, (don't read the next bit if you have not seen it! I don't want to be the one to ruin it for you!) My favorite bit was at the end when donkey and dragon had little baby's! They were little Donkeys with wings, and instead of a mane they had little spikes! (They were so cute!)      Ha! Ha! Ha! My Goldfish are staring at me! There in a big tank and there staring at me! I just hope my dad feed them this morning! There is a black and white fish which is mine called Panda, 2 Calico fan fish (hope I spelt it right), called Tasuki and Amiboshi, and 5 small glow in the dark fish called Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Wood!      Shhhh...My little Dashund is crying because my dad has just gone out to the shop for some random reason!! Wow I get to go to the Sealife Center today, to see the new Jellyfish, yeah.....That's not very exiting is it?      I'm watching the 'Black Night' Its a really cool film! At the moment the night is giving the medieval person some trainers?? (what's that about?)    Any way see you later,           Bye x x x

      Hi,     I am sooooo tired. I went to bed about 11:30pm, I stayed up to watch Bo Selector but I ended up watching Lord of the Rings the 2nd one with my Spanish student Teresa.     My sister, Kayleigh , has invited her friends round today, Amy and Becca, to watch battle Royale. Its really good, well I liked it any way! :oP     I'm now listening to Evanescence everybody's fool its one of my favorite songs.  I'm cleaning up as well because there is loads of food packets around me because I'm really hungry!!! Kayleigh is doing my head in as well! She is playing on Age of Mythology! (It sounds quite good, but she has the volume on full blast so you hear annoying sound every 5 seconds).       Got to go.         ( Its lunch time!)       Bye x x x

      Hello,          Ahhhh.....It was our last I.T lesson today and we had this supply teacher in, Mr Dudley, And he made us do stupid work on the computers when our teacher said we could bring in DVD's to watch, personal I think that's really snide! Then to make the day even more crap we had to play Danish long ball in P.E! (I really hate the game it does my head in!) While we were playing that I told Kelly I would write about them in my Blog so " Hello, Kelly and Lizz!"          Right now I'm sat in front of the computer eating chocolate and wasting a lovely sunny evening! :O) Well that's what my Dad said any way! Yeah! I've got to take my Spanish student to the sealife Center or swimming tomorrow!          Mmmuuuwwaaaahhaahhhaa....I now have my revenge!!!  Right this girl I really Hate at School called Hannah Keeps calling me names and making fun of me, so I told Kelly and Lizz that I would one day get my revenge, (This was about 2 weeks ago). Then What do you Know today I was walking past her and there was a big fat bee on her for head!! Everybody was screaming and me I was stood in the back ground going, "  Mmmuuuwwaaaahhaahhhaa....I now have my revenge!!!" People kept staring at me but ohh well!         See ya all later.                Bye x x x
