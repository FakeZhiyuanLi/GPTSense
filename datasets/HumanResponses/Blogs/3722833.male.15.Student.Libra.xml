       Woah!   Well, I'm back from a long absence.&nbsp; I have been doing alot of things the past week or so.&nbsp; One of those things was working on my new Website!   It isn't much yet, but it will be soon!&nbsp; It's called  Levile's Lair .   You should visit it and check out some of the links I put up.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm gonna go now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fare-Thee-Well

       This is my first Web Log Post.&nbsp; I guess I should introduce myself.&nbsp; You can all refer to me as Levile.&nbsp; I'm fifteen years old.&nbsp; The rest of my information is in my Profile.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Anyway, today I did a few things.&nbsp; For one I joined the Cowboy Bebop forums:  urlLink http://bebopforums.proboards19.com &nbsp; Also, I downloaded a new MP3.&nbsp; The song is titled "Green Bird."&nbsp; It's from Ballad of the Fallen Angels (Cowboy Bebop Session Five.)&nbsp; The song is hauntingly beautiful.&nbsp; A young lady by the name of Gabriella Robin sings the lyrics in a language that I'm not sure of.&nbsp; However, even though I can't understand the words, the song is still great.&nbsp; It makes you remember things from your past.&nbsp; Old friends, places, events, etc.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I should tell you all that I've been depressed for quite some time.&nbsp; Three years ago, I moved to Upland, Indiana and met a kid named Skai Haley.&nbsp; Me and him became very good friends.&nbsp; He was my only friend at the time.&nbsp; My family has always been moving around the state of Indiana.&nbsp; Despite this fact, I kept in touch with Skai.&nbsp; But now, I've moved too far away to contact him.&nbsp; I haven't a clue about his e-mail, and I forgot his address and phone number.&nbsp; The county I'm living in doesn't have the right phone book, so I can't look him up.&nbsp; I haven't seen him for two years.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Well, now that I've told all of you that, I guess I should stop whining and wrap up this post.&nbsp; However, to whomever reads this, if you know Skai Haley, tell him his fellow Otaku says hi.&nbsp; He'll remember me, I know it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Bye for now.&nbsp; I'll be sure to keep posting, though.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fare-Thee-Well
