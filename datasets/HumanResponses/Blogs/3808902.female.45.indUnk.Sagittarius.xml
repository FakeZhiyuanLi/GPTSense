      Well, this is a stretch for me- Mrs Tech-Challenged 2004! I must be out of my mind to start this, but then again I have been called crazy more than once in this life! I don't know how much I'll have to share so bear with me! I know that I will try not to be unfair to any person in my scope of friends- and will not spread gossip or slander anyone ! I only hope I will have something meaningful to say on occasion. WISH ME LUCK!!!!! KC in Fla

      Once again- for your giggle gene- My Friday Funny. Have a laugh my friends, it's better that a pill ( & this I know a little about lol) &nbsp;&nbsp; As &nbsp;I &nbsp;Mature........ As I mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  &nbsp;I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big willy or big boobs.  &nbsp;I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!  &nbsp;I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it  &nbsp;I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. &nbsp;&nbsp;Pass this along to 5 friends...trust me, they'll appreciate it. Who knows, maybe Something good will happen. If not...tough shit.  &nbsp;P.S.&nbsp; Thanks &nbsp;Janine! Have a great Day- Love KC

      My day off, which means house work. God, I hate it!&nbsp; I usually work until 10:30 on Tuesdays, so the Hubby is home alone with the kids. Which is all right, he's great with them- but more often than not the house winds up getting trashed, while he is watching CNN in the bedroom! Then I have to clean up the "aftermath" GRRRRR! &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think that it's fair that the one day off during the week, that I would normally use as "my time" I.E. web-surfing, gardening, reading , errands etc. should be taken up with cleaning the house for the second time in the week! ( Sunday is my cleaning day- top to bottom) I work all the rest of the time. I just did this shite 3 days ago! There are 5 people in this house damn-it! Why am I the only one that thinks toys all over the livingroom and 10 dirty glasses strewn around are upsetting??? Socks everywhere and HEY- a pair of size 4 toddler undies under the coffee table??!! Jeez- what happened last night? Or do I want to know????  &nbsp;&nbsp; What is that old comercial- "Calgon- take me away!!!!............ lol !

      All right, I know it's been a few days since I've been here- the truth is I didn't have anything of interest to say. That is, until I logged on last night and read the news..... &nbsp; A new man is now at the helm of Island records. At first I thought- so what? Just another corporate wonk to annoy all of us Lep fans. But after reading the article ( 3X, might I add) I've come to some conclusions. ( agree or disagree in my comments, I love a good debate!) &nbsp; 1- He seems to have come up the ranks from D.J.&nbsp; to Boss. This to me says he is a "music lover", as opposed to a Businessman (accountant, paper-shuffler - you all get my drift, right?) &nbsp; 2- The fact that of&nbsp;ALL the "established" artists that are managed by Island, He specifically mentions DL in the article makes me have hope!  &nbsp; 3- The release of LLWTG- FINALLY! Better late than never, perhaps. But if he liked the song alone- wouldn't he have released Lionel Richies version? After all, that would be promoting a record which has just been released- as opposed to one that has been concidered " dead in the water" for a while now. &nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know that I may be "blowing smoke" here, but I can't help feel that this is a good sign for the days to come. and the fact that our beloved guys are eligible for the "R&R hall of fame" as of 2005 ( you all know how I feel about THAT- and if you don't , see my tag line on the forums!;-) ) Having someone like him at the helm of the ship may just mean smoother waters ahead for our band.&nbsp; JMHO- And you'll forgive me if I hope that I'm right on this one! Cheers all, KC :-)

      >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIVE ME A SENSE of HUMOR, LORD  >  >  >There is the story of a pastor who got up one Sunday and announced to his congregation: "I have good news and bad news.&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is, we have enough money to pay for our new building program. The bad news is, it's still out there in your pockets."  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >While driving in Pennsylvania, a family caught up to an Amish carriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the carriage obviously had a sense of humor, because attached to the back of the carriage was a hand printed sign... "Energy efficient vehicle: Runs on oats and grass. Caution:&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not step in exhaust."  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >People want the front of the bus, the back of the church, and the center of attention.  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >"Somebody has well said there are only two kinds of people in&nbsp;&nbsp;the world. There are those who wake up in the morning and say, "Good morning, Lord,"and there are those who wake up in the morning and say, "Good Lord, it's morning."  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >A minister parked his car in a no-parking zone in a large city because he was short of time and couldn't find a space with a meter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he put a note under the windshield wiper that read: "I have circled the block 10 times. If I don't park here, I'll miss my appointment. Forgive us our trespasses." When he returned, he found a citation from a police officer along with this note. "I've circled this block for 10 years. If I don't give you a ticket, I'll lose my job.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead us not into temptation."  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >A father was approached by his small son who told him proudly, "I know what the Bible means!" His father smiled and replied, "What do you mean, you 'know' what the Bible means?"&nbsp;&nbsp;The son replied, "I do know!"&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, said his father. "So, son, what does the Bible mean?" "That's easy, Daddy.&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands for 'Basic Information Before Leaving Earth.'"  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >There was a very gracious lady who was mailing an old family Bible to her brother in another part of the Country.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there anything breakable here?" asked the postal clerk.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the Ten Commandments." answered the lady.  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >The minister was preoccupied with thoughts of how he was going to, after&nbsp;&nbsp;the worship service, ask the congregation to come up with more money than they were expecting for repairs to the church&nbsp;&nbsp;building.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he was annoyed to find that the regular organist was sick and a substitute had been brought in at the last minute. The substitute wanted to know what to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's a copy of the service," he said patiently. "But you'll have to think of something to play after I make the announcement about the finances.  >During the service, the minister paused and said, "Brothers and Sisters, we are in great difficulty; the roof repairs cost twice as much as we expected, and we need $4,000 more. Any of you who can pledge $100 or more, please stand up.."&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, the substitute organist played "The Star Spangled Banner."&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is how the substitute became the regular organist!  >  >--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  >  >Give me a sense of humor, Lord, Give me the grace to see a joke, To get some humor out of life, And pass it on to other folk&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Have a great weekend folks!

      I know, I haven't been here lately- but I had a good reason. Lightening hit the power pole in back of my house, which took out our power &amp; cable. I&nbsp;got the power back within a day, but the cable ( and my internet) took longer. There are times I wonder why these essential services are still above ground, and not in buried cables. After all, between hurricanes and Florida being the "Lightening Capitol" of the U.S., it would make sense,Huh? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just when I thought things were getting back to normal, #2 child ( Andy) comes to me this morning with an earache. So off to the Dr. we go!! $20 at the dr. , and $50 dollars for the drops for his ear!!! I guess its P.B.&amp; J. sandwiches for me 'til payday!!  &nbsp; Hope you all are well, and I did manage a little time to get the links fixed ( sort of- lol) I'll get this web- crap eventually! Be well! KC

      OK, after blowing off some steam, I though I'd try to get some links up. Well, they are not right again! though 3 of them are showing,I put in 6, and if you move the curser over one of them- 2 web addresses show up! GRRRRRRR! I really need to take a computer course or something. Any advice would be appreciated, since this is my 100th attempt, and I don't see anything wrong with what I put into the template. Ok, I'm gonna get off this thing for awhile- before this moniter winds up being a lawn ornament! Tata for now!

      Or Pissed or whatever! I got home last night from work and immediately my Hubby got in my face- " why didn't you make the car payment??!" I did! I mailed the frigging thing Friday,the 2nd. Well, they haven't got the darn thing yet!!!!  It was due last saturday ( at the latest) and I mailed it the day he got paid!    This bank I have my car loan through is supposedly a highly respectable institution, but the problem is they are based in North Carolina- NOT Florida! the closest branch of this bank to me is 2 hours drive. They have a web-site, but no payment options ( unless you have an account with them ) and you can not make a phone payment either ( unless your pymt. is 10 days LATE!!???). And this is the bank that the 3 biggest car dealerships in this area use for car loans!WHY!?? I can pay any of my other bills on line/over the phone with no problem. Even my local water company will take payments over the phone ( po-dunk town that I live in!) BUT NOT this upstanding institution!    So now, after talking with the rep from said bank, I will wait until this Friday, and if the check has not been recieved, they will call me and THEN take my payment over the phone. And I will have to pay the $30 fee to put a stop-payment on the check I sent, or end up paying twice ( which I can not afford!) Jeez- this Sucks! Off to throw a few pillows or something to vent! KC     P.S.- I am still tying to get you all linked up- I put the link section in, but the sites I have entered are not showing. Give me a little time to figure it out- I will get it done!

      Today my eldest is turning 14. Though mothers are supposed to love all their children equally ( and I do!) this one holds a special place in my heart. I know, you all think- she's your first, that's why. But no, that's not it. You see, a mother gives her children life- but Becky has returned the favor.      ( flashback) 12/27/2002- 9:30 pm. I had just goten home from work. Tired, but no more so than any normal day. Becky was up and asked if she could have ice cream. I remember saying that if she could get it herself, she could have it. The next thing I saw was some strange lady washing my hair. I was in the hospital, apparently having just had brain surgery. An Aneurysm that would have ended my life except for 1 thing. BECKY. She was there, and I have since learned, called 911, her dad, and gave me her breath to keep me alive. I would not be here if not for her. I love my daughter.      Hug your child ( or anyone's child- they're all special) It might be the best thing you do! Happy Birthday Rebekah Leigh Fine! I love you! Mom :-0

      One good thing about working  at the same job for a long time is that vacation time increases. I get a total of 4 weeks a year, and this is one of them! Tommorrow I'm off with my kids to Ocala, Fla- home of my good friend Janine. She's the one who put up living with me ( no easy task, I assure you!) in College. That she still thinks of me as a good friend after some of the lame-ass bull I did in school is truly a testament to what a great person she is! I hope that I have matured enough to make me more bareable now! Maybe I can get her to take a pic or two to put up later. And maybe I'll show her this blog- she'll be the first! And maybe she know's how to get the comment system working on this blasted thing. Michael tried, but the instructions are in tech=speak, and I am clueless as usual! Oh, and one more thing- Congrats to our favorite singer, on his upcomming nuptuals! He's picked a good day ( if the news is true ) I aught to know- It has been my wedding anniversary the last 20 years - Lep love, KC

      A talking frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He sees right away from her window nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack. (He can read, too.)  "Miss Whack, I'd like to get a $30,000 loan to take a holiday."  Patty looks at the frog in disbelief. In staying with the bnk policy pertaining to customer relations, she kindly asks him his name.  The frog says his name is Kermit Jagger, adds the fact that his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it's okay to give him a loan because he knows the bank manager personally.  Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral. The frog says, "Sure. No problem. I have this," and produces a tiny porcelain elephant, about half an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.  Very confused, Patty explains that she'll have to consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back office. She finds the manager and says, "There's a frog at my window who says his name is Kermit Jagger, he claims to know you, says his dad is Mick Jagger, and wants to borrow $30,000, AND he wants to use this as collateral." She holds up the tiny pink elephant.  "I mean, what in the world is this thing?"  (You're gonna love this).....................  (It's a real treat)......................  (Masterpiece)..............................  (Wait for it).................................  The bank manager looks back at her and says......  "It's a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man's a Rolling Stone."  (You're singing it, aren't you?!!! - I knew you would.)     Just a funny to end a long day! Thank's to my cousin Patti for this one! Have a good one! KC in Fla
