        Doggy-Mess Mystery Solved at Conn. Capitol  Conn. State Lawmaker Uses Videotape to Solve Mystery of Whose Dog Left Surprise in Capitol Room  HARTFORD, Conn. Aug. 13, 2004 — A state Senate leader says he has the scoop on the poop in the state Capitol. Senate Republican leader Louis DeLuca told reporters Thursday that he had a surveillance videotape proving that Democratic state Sen. Edith Prague's dog left a surprise in the Public Safety Committee room last week. Prague, who's from Columbia, Conn., initially denied that her dog, Molly the Shih Tzu, was the culprit, and she blamed a seeing eye dog belonging to a worker in DeLuca's office. After seeing the tape, Prague was stunned. "I said, 'Oh my God! It is my dog, and I won't bring her in anymore,'" said Prague, who had been asked before to stop bringing her dog into the Capitol. Then she said DeLuca might have more important things to worry about. DeLuca, of Woodbury, said he felt he had to make the tape public because Prague was blaming a blind person. "It's a shameless thing to blame a sightless person with a seeing eye dog when you know it was your own," he said. Capitol police watched the videotape, which shows Prague's dog making an unaccompanied visit to the committee room. "Modern technology is wonderful," DeLuca said. "It shows the dog in the room that day not doing the deed, but in the room." Capitol Police Chief Bill Morgan said his office handles such situations diplomatically. "When we find there are people who violate the rules, we try to correct the problem," he said, without offering any details on the matter.

The cart, pulled by a seven-year-old donkey named Tironi, was the first to reach the port city of Viana do Castelo from the suburb of Areosa some two kilometres (just over one mile) away, Jornal de Noticias newspaper reported Monday. Viana do Castelo opposition city councillor Antonio Jose Amaral, who helped organize the challenge held Sunday, said the result proved the need to build a ring road around the city of some 36,000 people. "Unfortunately the donkey ended up winning. This mode of transportation is not from our era but it looks like the get around Viana do Castelo we have to go back in time," he said. City officials have rejected the need for the construction of a ring road arguing there are no major traffic problems in the city. "If they knew what traffic is like in big metropolisis they would shut up so as not to seem ridiculous," the councillor in charge of traffic, Rogerio Barreto, said.

His relatives still do not know the reason of his sudden death. Pathologists mixed up the bodies and Sergey's relatives received the document based on the expertise of another deceased individual. "I lost two very dear people of mine in almost three weeks. At first my grandmother passed away, Sergey died in 18 days. When he died, all our relatives were on the edge of the nervous breakdown," Vologda resident Alexander Sitov said. "On August 5th we were waiting for Sergey's body outside the morgue. We were shocked, when we finally received the body. Instead of our tall and black-haired Sergey we saw the body of a fat bald-headed man," Maria said. The relatives were flabbergasted. When they asked pathologists whose body was it, they simply said the clothes on the body were Sergey's, the body was labeled with Sergey's number and name. Specialists were persistently persuading the relatives the fat man was Sergey Sitov. They said human beings change after death. "We were infuriated. We have recently read an article in a local newspaper about some people, who had buried someone else's relative. We could not imagine we would have to look for Sergey's body and exhume it from somebody else's grave," Andrey Makarov, the husband of Sergey's sister said. When the Sitovs said they would sue the morgue, a senior medical expert came out to apologize. Andrey Makarov started writing a statement, but the expert asked him "not to commit such a silly action." The morgue apologized, and it was ready to compensate the damage (the unknown dead man was dressed in the new suit the Sitovs bought for the funeral ceremony). "We did not want to hear anything. We told them to do whatever they wanted, but we needed to bury Sergey that day," Alexander said. When pathologists finally found Sergey's body, it turned out the ordered procedures had not been executed, although the Sitovs had paid for them. The relatives were shocked again on the graveyard: the casket they ordered was small for Sergey's body. They could not close the casket lid because of Sergey's legs. They eventually bended the legs in knees and covered the lid. Sergey Sitov's relatives feel guilty of burying their brother in a small casket. They intend to head to court. Yevgeny Sokolov, an administrator of the Vologda morgue said Sitov's incident would be investigated. The messy situation took place soon after the bodies arrived. "Our pathologists received two bodies. People from the Ritual firm gave them instructions, and pathologists mixed up the autopsy results," Yevgeny Sokolov said. The doctor added he sympathized with the Sitov's grief, although he asks for understanding too: "We receive more bodies than we did previously. The morgue premises became small." Yevgeny Sokolov and morgue employees do not understand the Sitov's intention to sue the morgue, because they have presented their apologies. The death of a dear person and the funeral ceremony is obviously the last opportunity to bid farewell to the deceased. It is very hard to turn a blind eye on such absurd and ridiculous negligence.

Yes indeed, the streets of Najaf will never be the same again once the followers of radical Shi'ite cleric Moqtada Sadr get their hands on this little beauty - aptly named the AK-MP3. Actually, it's just a replica AK-47 magazine, but slap it in your semi-automatic rifle and you're ready to shock and awe the US military with the sheer firepower of your playlist. Mind you, we don't think that Sadr would approve of the advertising snaps for this device, featuring as they do a young lady clad only in camouflage bikini with her hands firmly grasping an enormous weapon. Presumably her throes of ecstasy have been provoked by reading one of the audio books which come preloaded on the AK-MP3 when you pay the full whack of $600. Alternatively, you can have the thing without the books for $350, for which you get: 20GB storage Re-programmable firmware supports MP3, WMA plus additional future audio formats and software extensions Anti-shock protection up to 8 minutes for smooth listening USB2 interface offers fast digital transfer Up to 10 hours continuous playback with built-in rechargeable Lithium Ion battery, up to 18 hours with external battery box The AK-MP3 is apparently the brainchild of Andrey Koltakov, who says: "Hopefully, from now on many Militants and Terrorists will use their AK47s to listen to music and audio books. They need to chill out and take it easy." Right on, brother. While we doubt that the AK-MP3 will do much to promote world peace, love and understanding, we can think of a very practical use for it - to deter would-be muggers who have been  urlLink targetting iPods .

What's missing is a black artist. Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University, said the absence is ``beyond conspicuous'' since black artists often are credited with inventing rock 'n' roll. ``It would be like doing a set of cans of six great Impressionist painters and not including any French people on it,'' he said. ``It leaves out an enormous amount.'' The brewer and the magazine issued the cans this summer, depicting Elvis Presley, Blondie, Alice Cooper, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard and Willie Nelson, as well as two guitars. Gary Armstrong, chief marketing officer for Rolling Stone publisher Wenner Media, said race wasn't a consideration when choosing the artists. ``We didn't even consciously think pro or con, the same way that the only woman on there is Blondie. We just went with the people that we thought were appropriate,'' he said. ``We went through (the covers) and said these people we don't think are appropriate, or wouldn't appeal to Miller drinkers.'' Armstrong noted Rolling Stone wasn't around for the birth of rock 'n' roll - it was first published in 1967 - when many formative black artists of the genre emerged. And many artists who appeared on covers balked at being associated with a promotion involving alcohol, he said. Jimi Hendrix's estate, for instance, is protective of his image, Armstrong said. ``Again I think it might have had something to do with the beer.'' Miller spokesman Scott Bussen said the company started with a broad wish list. ``I'm sure that our objective was to get as diverse a representation of musical acts as well as diversity,'' he said, but the company's choices were limited to Rolling Stone covers. Miller spokeswoman Molly Reilly said other artists were considered, but ``these are the artists that gave us approval to use their images on the beer cans.'' Six of the initial 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland in 1986 were black, including Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray Charles and Little Richard. The Hall of Fame, which is throwing a summer concert series sponsored by Miller Lite, declined to comment on the cans. Todd Mesek, the hall of fame's senior marketing director, said ``African heritage is critical'' to rock's development. ``Arguably all rock and roll came from, or at least was greatly influenced by, African culture,'' Mesek said. ``Rock and roll came from R&B, jazz, folk. All those genres before rock and roll came together to birth rock and roll.'' William McKeen, chairman of the University of Florida journalism department and editor of the book ``Rock and Roll is Here to Stay,'' called the list strange. ``I look at rock 'n' roll in racial terms. Rock and roll is black America meeting white America,'' McKeen said. ``It's about the merger of white people's music, country, with black people's music, rural blues. ``I mean, sure, you can argue that Elvis opened the door, but then Chuck Berry and Little Richard and Bo Didley came through,'' McKeen said. Armstrong said each of the artists represents developments in rock history. For instance, Willie Nelson represents Americana and rock's roots, while Alice Cooper is ``stadium rock and shock.'' The artists weren't paid to appear on the cans, although some received perks such as free beer or magazine subscriptions, Armstrong said. He said he hasn't heard anything negative about the promotion, which is running in conjunction with three Rolling Stone special editions: rock immortals, moments and photos. In its immortals edition, 20 of the 50 rockers are black. Thompson said everyone has an opinion when it comes to rock, and the cans may have been designed to generate buzz more than anything else. ``My guess is a lot of people will have a lot to say about this list,'' he said. ``Oftentimes that's the point.''

Magazine receptionist and DJ Liz Wallenberg told The Post she was skating to see friends at an East Village club early Wednesday when she hit a bump in the road at 13th Street and Second Avenue. "I landed with my arm and back straight onto the metal cover," Wallenberg said. "I noticed it was kind of hot, but I didn't realize how bad it was until my skin started to sizzle." A distressed Wallenberg lifted her shirt and saw a large red imprint from the manhole cover on her back. She rushed to the next block, to Second Avenue nightspot Second Nature, to get her friends' help. They took her to the emergency room at Beth Israel Hospital, where she spent the next seven hours. "It was such awful pain," Wallenberg said. "There was blistering, and it was like I was branded. You can see the 'O' and the 'N' from 'Con Edison.' The doctor said a lot of this will scar for life." The accident occurred two blocks from where psychology student Jodie Lane died on Jan. 16. The 30-year-old woman was walking her two dogs when she stepped onto an electrified manhole cover and died instantly. A mixture of melted snow and salt, which corroded electrical wires, was found to have caused Lane's death — which stunned New Yorkers and led to community outcry. Con Ed publicly apologized for Lane's death in February while the electricity giant's safety practices were put under the microscope. A spokesman for Con Ed at the time said an audit of all manhole covers in Manhattan deemed them safe. But when asked yesterday about the latest incident, spokesman Chris Olert said they were "looking into" the incident. "If there is a problem there, we'll fix it," he said, admitting that the incident sounded "severe." But Wallenberg, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said: "They promised they would check everything and fix those problems. And now I have a manhole cover [branded] on my back." She said she's considering legal action against Con Ed, as she was unable to work for three days — nor was she able to perform her regular set, as "DJ L-Train," at the Williamsburg club Metropolitan on Wednesday. "I'm on prescription creams and painkillers," she said. "I ache all over, and I find it really hard to sit down." From:  urlLink http://www.nypost.com

        Policemen suspended over porn report    Sun 15 August, 2004 01:03     LONDON (Reuters) - Two policemen have been suspended from duty after a newspaper reported they had been filmed enjoying the attentions of porn stars while they were supposed to be on patrol. The News of the World reported on Sunday that the two policemen, aged 30 and 34, had been called to calm down a crowd who spotted a pornographic movie being filmed in a street in London's Soho district. But the officers talked their way into the film crew's van and allowed the two female stars to perform a sex act on them, while the crew secretly rolled the cameras, the paper said. "I was just expecting them to want their photo taken with the girls or get an autograph," the paper quoted the film's director, Marino Franchi, as saying. "It was unbelievable. They just decided to have their very own private porn movie while on the job." Scotland Yard said two male officers from the Central London Territorial Support Group had been suspended from duty and that a disciplinary investigation had been launched into their conduct while on duty in Soho on July 26. "The Metropolitan police service demands the highest standards from all its staff, and patrolling forms a vital part in keeping London's streets safe," a Scotland Yard spokesman said. "We are disappointed by conduct which, if substantiated, brings the service into disrepute."

A Cash Wise Foods loss prevention officer spotted the man opening a box of Hefty Garbage Bags at about 8 p.m. and pocketing the paper-covered wire ties. The man was stopped in the bathroom after he paid for his other groceries. The man said he took the twist ties to secure bags of bulk candy he purchased. The candy display usually includes twist ties, but there were none there Wednesday. The name of the man was not released pending a misdemeanor shoplifting charge. The value of the twist ties is unknown, but the garbage bags cost $3.88.

The unopened can had to go somewhere, but where? Not the simulated freezer. "This food wouldn't spoil in that location," the computer-generated voice said. "But the quality of food could be affected, or you might be using space in your freezer unnecessarily." Another lesson learned from the Fantastic Food Challenge, a package of four computer games designed to teach people who get nutrition aid such as federal food stamps how to make better use of their food. Because so many young adults played such games as kids, they ought to be able to learn more easily from them, too, said the project's director. "We wanted to create a game that didn't just feel like you were learning something," said Brian Winn, an assistant professor of telecommunication, information studies and media at Michigan State University in East Lansing. The player feels like a contestant in a marathon of futuristic television game shows that also happen to give instruction about how to buy food at the lowest cost, store it properly and prepare healthy meals, Winn said. One game is called Store It Safe. It involves placing baked beans, tortillas, frozen chicken and other virtual groceries into a cartoon-drawn freezer, cupboard or refrigerator. In another game, a version of Concentration, players turn over blank cards that flash a food and a menu item made with that ingredient, then try to remember which card had the milk that matches the macaroni and cheese. The on-screen opponent is an sore-loser robot that blows steam out of its ears when it guesses wrong, but which gets better as the game becomes more difficult. In the Great Meal Deal, players test their knowledge of the five food groups (milk, meat, fruit, vegetables and grains) by dragging randomly generated bananas, peanuts, applesauce and other items into the correct group. Players in the Price Makes Sense have to use their math skills to figure out the best food deal; for instance, that six servings of eggs at $1.20 is cheaper per serving than five servings of chicken at $2.00. The program is being distributed to employees in Michigan's extension offices who teach food aid recipients how to be efficient shoppers. So far, they seem to like it better than the usual brochures and charts, said Gayle Coleman, the extension service's interim state program leader for family consumer science. Food stamp users are not the only people who can benefit from these kinds of projects, said Melinda Johnson, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. But the poor may need the help more because they have fewer options, she said. For example, people in every income level have to squeeze healthy meals into busy lives, although those who are better off do not feel the budget pinch when they buy prepared meals at the supermarket, Johnson said. Researchers also have tried computer games to improve eating habits for about 1,600 fourth graders in Houston. They played a medieval-themed game called Squire's Quest, developed by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine's Children's Nutrition Research Center. Kids win by getting promoted from squire to knight. But the real goal is to get them to eat more fruits and vegetables. In the game, players advanced by learning such things as how to talk a parent into serving orange juice for breakfast and they gained negotiation skills by accepting pineapple juice if that was available instead, said Tom Baranowski, lead scientist in the game's development. "We do role-playing to encourage the kid to go home and ask Mom," he said.

Driving instructor Tahir Mahmood, 33, was driving in Blackburn, Lancashire, when he went through a large puddle. The water splashed over Pc Anthony Ellison, who was on traffic duty at the time, leaving him “completely drenched“. Mr Mahmood was pulled over by a police patrol car and immediately apologised, but was arrested and charged with driving without consideration for other road users. It was claimed he could have avoided splashing the officer by pulling into the right hand lane, which was free of traffic. But Mr Mahmood told Blackburn magistrates this week he had been looking into his wing mirror to change lanes and did not see the puddle until it was too late. The legal proceedings cost an estimated £20,000 and were described by one local councillor as “an utter waste of time“. A spokesman for Lancashire Constabulary today insisted the force had acted correctly.He said: “It is not a question of apologising.“ The officers presented a file to the Crown Prosecution Service and they judged it appropriate to prosecute.“ This was rejected by the court, which is something that happens in the British legal system. ”A CPS spokeswoman said: “On every case we decide whether there is enough evidence to bring a case and whether it is in the public interest to do so. “The answer to both of these in this particular case was ’yes’. ”Mr Mahmood was unavailable for comment today.

Police said that on Wednesday evening, Chihao Wu, a student studying English at Lewis-Clark State College, arranged rolled-up clothes, doused in lamp oil, in a parking lot to spell "Happy Birthday" in his native language. He then summoned his girlfriend and lit the fiery display. When police and members of the Lewiston Fire Department arrived, they found Wu stomping on the still-burning clothing. The would-be Casanova's conflagration ended when the fire department took an extinguisher to the flames, police said. Despite a language barrier, police officer Nick Krakalia questioned Wu. "It was his lady friend's birthday and he lit this fire in celebration," Krakalia wrote in his report. Wu said there was no tradition of such displays in his country, but he was trying "to show devotion to the female," Krakalia said. Wu cleaned up the mess and was not ticketed for the incident. When Krakalia asked if she was impressed with the display, she simply said "No." From:  urlLink http://apnews.myway.com
