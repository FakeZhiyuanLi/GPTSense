      well, i started growing a moustache yesterday (2004 May 26)  noboddy seems to have noticed yet but I'm pretty sure a few of the older ladies at the office are starting to catch on - they have been giving me the "hey, kyle sure doesn't look like a 16 year old anymore" and "wow, kyle really fills out those vintage brown polyester pants quite well" eyes.  come monday i'll start cruising the old babe bars and test out my new moustache's ridiculous attraction powers;  if this upper lip hair-piece pans out - i think i may have opened up the sacred locked door of older women - reports will follow along with pictures of my new not-so-secret weapon

      i live in a colorful neighborhood  white/tan/black/yellow/brown/spicy people all over the place  i'm friendly and I like to wave at people when they drive by because it makes me feel like i'm not as depressed & lonely as I really am - anyways  most everybody waves at me because i always initiate the wave, regardless of what flavor they are - except the yellow people  i don't understand it - they just drive by and look at me like i just punted their dog over my house  i only have a few yellow friends and they really like me but...maybe their is something that they aren't telling me that is keeping me from acceptance in the yellow community  maybe i will ask the black kids that play on my basketball hoop - they seem pretty sharp

      today at work i was in the bathroom cutting a whiz and some guy pulls up into the stall next to me and starts his business  so we're both doing what we are supposed to and things are going fine.  then this guy just dropped a bomb and it was mega loud & long.  i can't believe it because I'm about 10 inches away from this dude and he just sh*t on me basically  being the idiot that I am, i start laughing because it's funny (well it was funny because it was so damn loud) and now i'm laughing for like 15-20 seconds and I can't stop  this guy didn't laugh & he looked at me like - damn not only do you look like an idiot, but you actually are one, i think he either wanted to slap me or finish taking his piss on my leg  instead i peed on my pants from the chuckle i got  bathroom farting is funny

      Yeah, I've been taking a multivitamin for nearly three days now.  It contains 300 mg of LYCOPENE.  It's helping me neutralize free radicals which can help prevent cell damage.*  Emerging science suggests that this remarkable nutrient may help reduce the risk of heart disease.*  I haven't felt this healthy in nearly two weeks and I can tell that all my radicals have been neutralized - all thanks to my multivitamin w/ lycopene.  *THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.  Since I started taking my new multivitamin I've really become a great lover and I'm as virile as an ox.**  My manhood has also increase in length & width by 20% - 35%.**  I've also become much more attractive to most women in the age range of 18 - 34 according to emerging scientific testing**    **THIS STATEMENT HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY ANY FEMALE HUMAN BEINGS.

      i have alot of bad ideas for t-shirts that probably wont sell (hopefully updated as I think of more)  like i said above - most of these are poor sellers and rather stupid but it keeps my mind off or work - i'm taking suggestions.  1)  "I am sweating through this T-Shirt." 2)  "I probably can't satify you." 3)  "Washed-Up Athelete" 4)  "I've been staring at your chest." 5)  "I drive a sh*tty car."  Well, most of these t-shirts would be worn exclusively by me - but I imagine their are others out their like me...right?

      damn - it happened again - an un-neccesary experience in the bathroom  note:  the bathroom I enter today has one standard urinal w/ autoflush along with two sit-down areas  so I enter the bathroom as a fellow co-worker just finishes using the urinal - standard procedure - i say "hey", he says "hey" as I slide by him washing his hands and stroll slowly to the self-flushing urinal that has just finshed a cycle  as i reach for the buttons on my pants (button fly - yep, i'm an idiot) i catch a quality wiff of this dude's piss.  and it's very upsetting.  not only because the smell is disturbing but because generally in the bathroom you can tell immediately if you can use a standard breath or take short gasps through your t-shirt because somebody dropped an H-bomb in stall #2;  i happened to be breathing normally because their was no precence of any rotten air upon entering the lav. which turned out to be a horrible decision.  now generally the smell of urine doesn't really bother me all that much - but today my body desides to defy me and throughs in a gag - the type of gag where you have the taste of throw up in your mouth for 10-15 min.  so now i'm confused at what has just happened and take a step back as my eyes are either watering from the gag/near throw up or burning from the smell/taste of the urine eating away at my lungs & esophogus.  either way I look like a bigger idiot that normal because i'm struggling at the stall again!  i wish I could have laughed or thought of something witty to say to make this story entertaining but I got my composure back and decided to struggle through completing the task at hand  either way - hopefully the gas-man & acid-urine don't combine forces to keep me from using the facilities here in the building

      it ain't all that bad out there is it?  i know I have at least 6 things to be thankful for - i bet you have some too  1)  Banquet Dinner/Entrees Thanks to Rainbow Foods in Robbinsdale I can get 10 Banquet Dinners for 8 dollars.  If my math is correct, that calculates out to be about $0.80 per day (excluding tax if their is any?).  Lets see, last week my lunch went down something like this:  Monday:  Country Fried Pork Tuesday:  Chicken Fried Beef Steak Wednesday:  Chicken Fried Chicken Steak Thursday:  Chicken Fried Chicken Friday:  (Out to lunch @ the local Chinamen establishment)  Although I knew from looking at the package's title of the banquet dinners what type of meat I was supposedly eating,  I'm willing to bet that on all five (5) days - it is likely that I ate the same "meat product".  Note: for $0.80 i recieve nearly 50% of the fat & sodium I need for one day.  God bless.  2)  Seinfeld is on for two hours everyday.  Which I rarely miss unless I'm oblidged to be somewhere else that I probably don't want to be (like at my parents or at softball or at friends wedding).  TBS: 6:30, 7:00 FOX: 7:30  3)  Chicago White Sox - they are just shitty enough to let my Minnesota Twins consistenly win Central Division Championships.  4)  Lack of severe body hair.  I don't have much of it above the waist which I am very grateful for.  I can boldly say that I have less chest & mustache hair then at least two of my ex-girlfriends.  I'm a man, a man that does not have intense body fur.  5)  Drunk Dancing.  No, not "Dirty Dancing", but drunk dancing.  The act where highly intoxicated men & women decide that they are most likely the best boogier in a bar/club and figure the only way to prove it is to shake that thang on the dance floor.  I am 100% for drunk dancing as it often leads to other activities that only occur when individuals are totally smashed and unlikely to know each others first/last names.  Note - I will not & did not make a move on your gal R.B. - no matter what she claims.  6)  hmmm...
