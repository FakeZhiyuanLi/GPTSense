      it's gonna be a lonely, lonely, lonely,  lonely day.. phantom planet's song, ringing through my head..  enjoyed my day, at the beach yesterday. but, it wasn't perfect, my sayang wasn't there.. all the time, Incubus', I Wish You Were Here, was playing in my mind...  ___________________________________ Wish You Were Here  I dig my toes into the sand The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket I lean against the wind Pretend that I am weightless And in this moment I am happy...happy  I wish you were here  I lay my head into the sand The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it I'm counting UFO's I signal them with my lighter And in this moment I am happy...happy  I wish you were here ___________________________________  here's one of my own:-  If only i could, I would hold you by the shores, And share the same air that blows..  If only i could, I would walk with you on the sands, And have your hand in mine..  If only i could, I would face the seas with you, And wrap my hands round your waist..  If only i could, I would sit you on the rocks, And feel your legs against mine..  If only i could, I would.. (",) ___________________________________  really wished my sayang, shazleen, was there at that moment of time.. her call made my day, and her msg that night, felt so beautiful.. "you are my one and only"

      this is a song, which i wrote yesterday. yepz.. breaking it into its parts, but its supposed to be a long proclaimation..(so read in a breath!!) so 'ere we go!! -----------------------  (Verse) I miss you, I need you, More than my next breath of life.. And I want you, in my arms, So reassure, my restless heart,  (Chorus) That you want me, that you need me, that you miss me, more than i miss you.. That you want to, be in my arms.. For the rest of my, restless days..  (Verse) Cause i believe, You're the one.. Who'll end my lonely nights, (these) Fear-filled days..  So i ask you, To hold up you're hair, And with this, Please be mine..  And i'll cherish you, And i'll promise you, So reassure, My restless heart..  (Chorus) That you want me, that you need me, that you miss me, more than i miss you.. That you want to, be in my arms.. For the rest of my, restless days..  (Outro) Cause i want you, And you're always on my mind.. All day, Whole nights.. I spend sitting here, Thinking of you..  I want you, I need you, I miss you, More than you miss me.. And i want you, In my arms, For the rest of my, Peaceful days.. i want you.. -------------------------  Btw, its entitled: With This, Please Be Mine..

      lets start with a foo fighter line, that played in my head, after sending her home..  "Someone's always someone elsest one.. ... ... You're not the one, but you're the only one, who can make me feel like this.."  i guess i've found that someone.. someone who was lonely as i, someone whom i made mine, someone who make my days go by, someone whom i like looking in the eye, someone who needs me, someone whom i can't live without, someone who made my other half, someone whom i made full, someone who misses me infinitely, someone whom i miss beyond eternity, soemone who can stand my nonscence, someone whom i will stand up for, someone who's name is close to my heart, someone who's name is Shazleen..  that summarizes it, doesn't it? I MISS YOU..

      today, when i wanted to blog on my livejournal account, my account was somehow not found, and i couldn't sign in.. stupid livejournal.. all those times i wrote journals, all deleted.. sucks..  well today's kinda boring.. going to jb later.. haha, i think i know why it feels boring.. i'm not with her.. been so for the past few days, and i really miss her, and i want to hold her hands.. damn, i sound mushy..  well, also partly cause of Fairmont's song.. a line in the song, "Everyone, everywhere is having fun, then there's me.." haha..  got down a few lines for a new song last night.. "Monday seems so far away,  the day that i will see you next..  The day that you'll be here to stay,  Monday seems so far away.." got part of the music too, vaguely..  listening to Thrice now, "to awake and avenge the dead", power song!!  I MISS SHAZLEEN!! and its killing me.. arrgh.....

Let me be the one you confide in, Let me be the one you hold dear.. Let me be with you when i'm not around, Let me be with you through all your downs.. Let me love you with all my might. And if i don't ask for anything in return, Let me be your true love..... -----------------------------------  I love you shazleen.. i wish i could do anything for you, but i'm only no one.. but, I love you.. i want it to mean alot.. (",)  Every night i still miss you, And only you, Makes my world go round..

Only One by Yellowcard its actually like a break-up song, so i hate the other lyrics.. but look at the chorus, amazing, as you..  Only One (Chorus) ------------------------------------------ Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one, no one like you You are my only, my only one My only one My only one My only one You are my only, my only one ___________________________________________  hehe.. okay lah.. bridge, not chorus..  Short letter:  Shazleen,  As i sit here, watching the computer screen, an image of you popped-up, then i realised that the image, was one of both you and me together.. the one where we were together, outside the cinema at bugis, lookin' into each other's eyes..  I smiled, as i thought of that piture, and after i realised that it was actually, my screensaver..(hehe..)  I miss you so much hotcakes..(with syrup..) I'll hold on to you, Through thick and thin... You'll be the one i won't give up on, Unlike failed pasts and memories.. I'll try my best, To be there when you need me, To be there when you're down, To be he one who really listens, To be the one who cares, And, To be so much more...  Alamak, sounds like marriage vows.. hehe.. but yah.. i'll try within my powers, and the powers that God gives me, to hold on to you, cause i remembered your words, "i think you're the one.." well, to me, you are.. i'm a changed Irfan after your arrival, into my life, and i'm different..  to be honest, i'm not as rash, i'm not as stupid, i'm not as boring, i'm not as fucked-up, as i usually am.. pardon my language, but its the only way i can describe it.. you changed me.. i love you..  now, more than ever, i truly believe that, "love" is a hard word to say.. but i know, I LOVE YOU.. you'll be sleeping, but i hope you feel it in your heart, cause, i'm beside you wherever you are.. ok, that sounds scary.. haha.. ILOVEYOU..
