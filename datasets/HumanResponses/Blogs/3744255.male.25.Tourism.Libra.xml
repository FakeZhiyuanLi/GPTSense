      Be what you are... This is the first step toward becoming better than you are  A smile is the light in the window of your face  that tells people you're at home  Love is to let those we love be perpectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image oterwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them  Blessed is the person who too busy to worry in the daytime  and to too sleepy to worry at night  Put your futere in good hands your own  People often say that this or that person has not yet found himself But the self is not something one finds. If is something one creates  Slow down and everything you chasing  will come around and catch you  If you don't like something change it; If you can't change it, Change the way you think about it  Plant your own garden and decorate your own soul. Instead to waiting for someone to bring you flowers.  The most exhausting thing in life  is being insincere  Begin challenging your own assumptions Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in awhile or the light won't come in  The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; To be conquered by yourself is of all things most shamefull and vile  Inside myself is a place whe i live all alone and that's where i renew my springs that never dry up.  No one can go back  and make a brand new start. Start from now  and make  a brand new ending.  The only thing in life which you can successfully change and control is yourself  Solutions are  easier to find if you don't worry about finding them.  Seek variety in the things you do and discover how beautiful and colourful life can be.  One way to achieve  independence is to prepare fot everything  in advance.  Don't see barriers as obstacles. They are challenges to be conquered.  Feeling worn out? Take time out from the routine and give yourself a berak. Pampering yourself is not a sin.  Clearing out  all negativity in your life... is the first step to self-improvement  Only women have got everything it takes to be a working woman, wife and mother at the same time... Be happy you were born a woman  Remember  that it's you who take control  of your work, not the other way around  A little smile will be a good start to open the day It's a small thing but worth it.  Love like you is everything so very warm and true Love is the special world that's shared by you and me Love shall never fade away, but shall always stay 2gerher an ever and ever I Love You...  i want her be happy no matter what it mean... i want her to find someone who treat hear with all the love   she deserve from me i want her to meet someone, who see she always  as i do now though your eyes,God!!!  i'm thingking of u in my sleepless solitude tonight if it's wrong u then my heart just won't let me be right couse i've drowned in u n' i want full trougt without u by my side  baby can u feel me imagining i'm looking in u eyes i can see u clearly vividly emblazoned in my mind and yet u're so far like a distance star i'm wishing to night

      I'll be there for you...I swear. Anytime you want me I'll be there time and time again, Until you'll understand.  Give your smile to everyone but, Give your love for the only one.  It is hard to find someone really love me and take Good care me, when I lose wilt.. O.. God, send me an angel of my heart.  If you want someone bad enough, You got to reach out and grab it  I just want you to know, the one I love most is you And I will always love you even us change. You still the one I love.  What can I do to make you love me What can I do make you care What can I say to make you feel this What can I do to get you there… What can I change to make you be mine…  I love you… I need you... I want you… Are easy words to say, but when It came to truth it mean nothing at all Cause those words only use for a game...  Treat me kind, sweet destiny Carry me through desperation… To the one that was waiting for me It took so long, still I believed that Somehow the one that I need, Would find me eventually…  When I first saw you... I saw love And the first time you touched me, I felt love And after this time, you're still the one I love.  Give me the chance to prove it to you  And I'll make it up to you Take me for what I am and my sorrow cause  I'll never change my colors for you Girl.. I still believe in you You break down the wall with strength of your love With a love that will always be, For all the time I've hurt you, I apologize…  Everynight I have same dream Now... I have you here by me I can't let you go... I need for you to stay So listen to me...Once    " I LOVE YOU " With you I never wonder you be     there for me With you I never wonder you are    the one for me.   One last looks... Before I leave all behind. I got put  You out of my mind. This time stop living with lie. I guess I'm gloom to my sorrow. I know I got to be strong Cause love and live goes on and on!   You are more beautiful than music Your face is like a poem And in your eyes, girl... heaven  Once I could handle the truth. When the truth was you But time after time out all the promises you give me Turned out to be a lie. And now I see I'm just somebody Who wasted all my time with you?  I finally found the love of live time A love will last in whole live thought.  Didn't we almost win it all Now, it all over 'cause we all different.  What else should I be, what else should I say What else should I write… I apologize For what I have done… forgive me 'Cause I can't live without you here by my side.  Won't you take me to be your love The only and the one love you have.  Love is beautiful word to said Love full with happiness Love could change everything True love hard to find True love never died.  Someone in my heart,  that I love so much.. Someone do care for and  I love so much. Someone always make me cry  and treat me cruel Someone that make me happy  is you girl.  I think about you, I fear that you gone Please stay with me, girl I miss you, don't go away  Someday two of us will be together, but We don't know where and how All you have to know is that I love you Only time could change this.  All I need is the air that I breathe To love you, girl.  Aku suka kamu Tulus... Laksana bara yang menyala Sejenak... Kemudian lenyap. Aku suka kamu Tulus... Seperti api yang menyala Sejenak... Kemudian gelap. Tolong... Genggam tanganku Agar yang maya ini jadi nyata...  I learn love isn't persecution and I learn love won't wait Now I learn love is imperishable but I learn to live.  Loving you like world belong to us Together we share this love and care I hope this love will be last till end I always love you. Save this love as long as time goes by You the one in my head And I want to give my love just for you Wish our love for valentine's day…  Love is very essence of live A power that change any mind The power of love unlock door of life's And breakdown barriers that separate human.  Roses are red, Violet are blue, Sugar is sweets, but not sweet as you.  When I fall in love  No body knows how I really love you You that I can forget You always in my mind In a thousand year we live I would die for your love and your kisses There are one-thing memories to remember It's a true love%

Becoz, another person's finger  would fill them in. Hope u'll find the hand that U r mean to hold on forever.  "God give us two hand to hold, two eyes to see, two legs to walk" but why God give  us only one heart..? Bcause God give another one heart for U to find.  Remember that always be someone who remember U everyday, every second,with or  without messages, & that's ME! take care ok   Who ever in this life should be hv a bestfriend, who can standing right beside us for walk and talk together. And U know my friend? I hope U r the one  When the angels fly with their wings, I hope they can catch me if I fall. And I hope one of the angels is U... cause U can make me feel so comfort.    May our relation turn into silver, silver into gold, gold to diamond and may our diamond be forever.  When the night comes, look at the sky. If U see a falling star, dont wonder why just make a wish. Trust me, it will come true, because I did it and I found U...   If I have 10 bestfriend, 1 of them is U. If I only have 1 bestfriend, it must be U. If there is no anyone, its mean I hv gone.. thanks for being my bestfriend.  The most beautiful word is ALLAH, the most beautiful song is AZAN, the world's perfect encyclopedia is AL-QURAN & HADIST and the world's best exercise is SHALAT.

When GOD open the windows of heaven, He saw me and ask: "what is your wish for today?" I said "Lord, please take care the person who's reading this message!  "OH Lord,Give me your love and love them who loved You,and Lord make the person who's read this always in Your love,couse I love her" a prayer before I sleep  I trust u all my life, just be ur own self...n dont u ever be anybody's property till d time comes...  correct: I love U forever,but i'am sory for all ur kindness i will prove to u somday we'll be togethet forever  Dont ever said lke that i always your u know forever in heart  Thank u so much,4 the attention,love,spirit..relize that living around the beloved people is the best God gift 2 me..I would be having a life, miss U  We dont know what happen 2morrow, maybe i am, maybe not, good nite n good luck !
