      Jesus, gay men are so fickle I swear!  I guess I am included.  Well, hmmm.  First off I started to really like Paul, I really did!  But, Eric and Matt broke up and then Paul decides to drop Will and go for Matt.  A little more tatter on my heart... But grrarg so I moved on to another very cute boi named Ryan.  Ryan is an amazing boi.  He remembers me from a time that I went dancing.  Well, one problem with this boi, he is 45+ minutes away... I wish it was easier.  And then again, there is now this boi in Cheaspeake named Brandon, really, really artsy and talented and welll available.  He is a complete gay virgin, all over one hundred percent. Gosh!  I swear being gay is soooo frickin' hard!  But, alas I would have it no other way.

      This is my first post and already we get some dirt.  I have never believed in fate at all.  The entire thought process of your past, present, and future is predetermined, that it is planned that it is always been planned.  *shivers* Creepy, neh?  Well for the first time in my life I am able to see it play out   And, I am to assume that as with all great tales there is a place to start, a beginning, so to follow this tend I assume to start there.  Eric a.k.a Sunshine is a good friend of mine, who lives to dance and have fun invited me to Salem’s Homecoming Dance.  Well, to fate’s divine plan Eric lost my ticket to his cousin who in turn gives it to her boyfriend.  Eric informs Will at 6:00ish, a mere hour before the dance. *sighs* Will’s heart is a little tattered. *sighs* Alas at around 8:00ish this 32 year old man aim’s me and talks to me and then gives me this one boy’s screen name.  I talk to this mass cutie and discover that we have similar interests and he speaks German (I do as well)! So, it seems that somehow I was to miss the dance to talk to this great individual.  Morality?  I never thought that missing a dance could have purpose or meaning but it did, and I am not one to normally agree, but there is no way around this. ~Will

      These past days have been hell!  I am on a emotional roller coaster with no breaks and it is running 24/7! I swear!  Lol, I get to confused easily like I swear I have the attention span of a gerbil, it is sad really!  I get distracted by alumium foil... So, this is short b/c I have a lot to do, but my future looks brighter

      So, we get up at 5:30ish am (not fun)!  I was more tired then a hounddog in the middle of the forest after chasing some coons.  So, we all get in our little family sedan, my Ethiopian cousin, my psycho mother, my sick step-father, Tatina and me.  So, on the way to Richmond, my step-father vomits twice, my mother is yelling and screaming, I am TRYING to sleep, Shane is bright-eyed looking for something.  Needless to say when we get to Richmond, my father goes to the hospital and we go to Deb's.  Deb of course is making all of the food as we arrive to sit and wait for HOURS!  When mother is at the hospital...  So, my step-father has pancreasitis, fun, fun!  Gosh, I HATE IT HERE!  There is no, instant messaging services on the computer at all, it is a dail-up (lagging, isn't the word I am looking for... slow as a snail?)  I want to be back in Virginia Beach in my own bed, in my own house.  I hate fully like you aren't where you need to be.  i am worried about how Jared's Thanksgiving is, with his two exes there...  And, Micheal, he is in Florida, I want to give up!  I am sooooo annoyed by this place already.  It is like rusty, dirty, sharpened, Indian (Yes Indian have you seen that one dude nails?  They drag!!!) nails on some beatup chalkboard.  I can't wait to be home!

So, anyways firts of i went to the "Three Days Grace, Counterize, and Down from Zero" concert with Lauren and Micheal.  Micheal, may I say is a mass cutie-pie, damn you rock boi, hardcore.com!  He is really sweet and sooo gentle at the concert we took turns being behind each other and our hands slowly rubbed up each others torso and in the car ride home, he placed his hand on my thigh and then he placed it in my hand and gently rubbed it with his.  So, Micheal if you read this, you really are awesome.com!  Then to Jared boi you still are number one in my book!

      So there was a disturbing incident that happened yesterday and to protect the guilty I wrote a poem to explain it… And I wrote two more for Jared!  I heart him!  He is great! I sent him his package today it will be there Wednesday!  Damn, $13.73 cents later! You owe me, boo! Lol, it will all be better when I get his package!  I know I can’t wait! So, Sam and I are having an argument that I shouldn’t eat my free range organic turkey for Thanksgiving. We got into this argument that Tatina, the turkey was murdered by a senile roster accidentally when Farmer Hasiwitz left an axe on top of Tatina’s pen.  So, now   One boy that I did truly love broke my heart Not soon after we did start Another boy spread poisons and lies About me and him and how we are And now united those two become  And then soon take it too far To spite me and piss me off  Together they two decide to call They dial my number With expert care for they do know  I will be there, I answer the phone  The number blinking unknown The first is there and pleasantries flow And not soon after the other stupid hoe Opens his mouth and the giggling starts I understand now what this is about The first speaks and tells me Of the thong that just fell to his feet And of the other mouth that went to his meat Where this is going and why I am not sure They start telling me of sex and of lust Inside I scream “What the f---?” They share their whore-like views Of love and the word’s abuse  They slander love and all that it is Telling me that love  Forever for me  will seize to exist And, how I should crawl and say “Misunderstand and unwanted” I tell them of their seedy misdeeds That love is for the honest The true ones that really do care And that it for them will never be there They shoot back between moans and groans  That I mistaken and therefore alone I shoot back  that I am “Happy and quite pleased” That I am not the one committing misdeeds With whom I might have And what real love will come to be They cut me off with details Of the first’s now arching cumshot At this point I have had enough I hang up the phone, disgusted and sick By their twisted view of what love is They never will see That love is a blessing, not a type of abuse And those if you with to have it  You will wait and see that it isn’t about sex  That it is of caring for the one that is there And embracing forever of what we have with no cares      Dear angel, my salvation Save me from this wretch That I have found myself in You are the one who can save me In your embrace, I am not drowning In the waves that are crashing Engulfed in a black hole Destroying my mind and my soul  I will always find love in you I am stuck, will you come and save me? Why are you the one so gentle? Why are you  the one so pure? You are the angel that loves Never been in this place before  You can always lift me higher And can restore my faith in life Almost giving up on love With your kiss you save me I now believe in what love is  I will always find love in you I am stuck, will you come and save me? Why are you the one so gentle? Why are you  the one so pure? You are the angel that loves Never been in this place before You can save me  I never believed in anything Not even myself, it was nothing I will always find love in you I am stuck, will you come and save me? Why are you the one so gentle? Why are you  the one so pure? You are the angel that loves Never been in this place before  Come my heaven and fill my room For I never knew what love is Until tonight, when you came And, saved me from what I was before Never been loved by an angel Never by anything so pure Come and join me tonight An show the world What love is and how you are  I never have been love by an angel Never anything so pure Never loved by an angel Till tonight when You heaven filled my room Until tonight when Your heaven filled my room    Don’t be afraid, this won’t hurt Have some faith this is real Together all this feelings we can sort We together  can feel If you just believe in me If you ever just wish to understand If you wish to stay   And, to let your thoughts run free If you just believe in me Take my hand  Walk together with me Take my hand  Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world we can be   Take my hand  Don’t let it slip like grains of sand Take my hand Don’t worry at all, this is fine Have some passion, this is real Together we’ll never draw the line We together can feel If you just believe in me If you ever just wish to understand  If you wish to stay And, to let your thoughts run free If you just believe in me Take my hand  Walk together with me Take my hand  Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world we can be   Take my hand  Don’t let it slip like grains of sand Just take my hand And believe in what is  there… In you and in me…

      Okays, Samantha's kitchen was nasty to the max.  So, gross!  Like, like there was disgusting peanut butter fudge that was in the dirty water for like 4 days!  Then the sink was clogged, not a surprise, so the little flamer, the butter knife and the sink disposal get into a little fight twenty minutes later it worked, so then back to dishes, they were all slippery and nasty, and plain gross!  I hated it.com.  So, it was not fun at all.  And, then the rangetop!  There was these black grease ring thingies, and I sat there, well I stood there with the scrubby pad and this putrid smelling cleaner, gagging on the fumes, it was like it was from a jock that hasn't showered after a decathlon.  So, Samantha's kitchen it clean now! Woot, woot!  And more to woot about I wrote more poetry, so here is that...  Thanks again to my good boo, Jared!   An Absolute Must  My heart yearns for you  across the many miles that seperate us  We know this to be true  for us, being together is an absolute must  My heart cries out to yours  across the many miles that seperate us  It is eachother that lures  for us, love and care is an absolute must   My heart burns for you bright across the many miles that seperate us  We know our own fire we light  for us, our desire is an absolute must   My heart for you belongs within  across the many miles that seperate us  A smile or even a simple grin  for us, tenderness is an absolute must   My heart for you will always be  across the many miles that seperate us  For you, for the entire world to see  for me, you are my absolute must     Take my hand  Don't be afraid, this won't hurt Have some faith, this is real Together all this feeling we can sort We together can feel  If you just believe in me  If you can ever just wish to understand If you wish to stay And, to let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world can be Take my hand Don't let it slip like grains of sand Just take my hand Don't worry at all, this is fine Have some passion, this is real Together we will never draw the line We together can feel If you just believe in me If you ever just wish to understand If you wish to stay And, to let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Together in this world we can be Take my hand Don't let it slip like grains of sand Just take my hand And believe... In you... In me...

      Jared embarked upon his journey, steadfast and determined he overcame many obstacles that still plague him.  Our young hero is suffering from a constant fever of 103 degrees with an incrediably horrible cough and a sore throat the size of Texas.  His small issue of not sleeping because he is bound and determined to learn all of the music for "The Nutcracker," for his school has slowed him down, but not to the point of stopping him.  His attitude always positive looking ahead, not behind.  His sexy green eyes aglow with passion and desire, he knows what he wants, a spot on the show.  A chance to live out one of his dreams.  Four days in California to prove to himself, he can do whatever his mind wishes.  And, you know it boo!

      Beggesus! Gosh, it was cold last night, I mean seriously, I wanted to jump into a lighted fireplace, I don’t think that would help either, the whole I would be dead thing wouldn’t help at all because we all wish to live.  I don’t think it helped that I am one to sleep buck-naked but still dang it was cold!!!  So I got 3, yes count them one, two, three comforters to curl under combined with my new body pillow and fell asleep.  I dreamt some freaky, creaky dreams I tell you.  That is the last time I eat before I go to sleep!  Damn, chocolate, may you rot in purgatory, for all of your sins.  Have you ever really noticed that?  Chocolate, I mean.  There is sooo much temptation it is outrageous.  And, then you eat to much and your stomach be hurting, all because yur gave into it.  So, maybe that is why.  And, they do say not to eat before you go to bed, so kids listen to me, "NO CHOCOLATE BEFORE BED!"  There that is settled.  So, people have been giving me bracelets…  So people keep them coming!  But now the braclets on my left arm are never coming off, not at all!  Well, maybe for me to shower but that is all!  Or if someone that I care to listen to tells me to take them off.  But, it won’t be my parents, nope no-sir-e-bob!  So, I have the snuffles and like badly.  I would make myself chicken soup but I can’t because I don’t eat meat.  So, when I get home I am gonna have some tea, yeppers some chamomile tea!  Maybe I will feel better!  That is my plan!  So, tomorrow I am getting Nicole’s digital camera and we are gonna do some “amateur” photography for Jared.  I shaved, and trimmed, and clipped, so I can look somewhat attractive... I can’t yet to send them and also take them.  It will be more fun than a jack rabbit tripping on some acid while in the funhouse.  So, anyways I wrote Jared another poem and I will post it later…  My Morning Just as wonderful as the morning sunlight Arranging and filtering onto my face Resting next to you, my heart fills with delight Every moment gazing at you in this place Dreaming together about how we are  Spending every waking morning with you by my side Perfect match, together we will go far In these morning times we have nothing to hide Every dawn we have to spend and enjoy it Heaven is our little room, lying in your embrace Lying in your arms, and feeling your sweet kiss Every single touch you place my body won't erase Remember always the together we will forever  be bliss

      To Jared, hun you may be low but read this and you will know I am for real, I don't wish to end up in that vicious cycle, so I wrote a personal add for you:  If you're interested in finding that guy that's not like the rest, maybe you've stumbled across him here. I'm not into the whole gay scene where everyone just wants to sleep around with whoever and go clubbing for the rest of their lives and TRY to look young and wantable, but that's not me. I'm not planning on bouncing around from man to man for the rest of my life. I want a steady relationship centered on trust, love, friendship, companionship, and just a passion for eachother. I'm not out there for your sex, but for your heart. For your love. So if you want to find someone that will care for you, be your shelter from the storm, and just love you til the day you die, please contact me and we can start getting to know eachother, the sooner the better right? I don't know about you but I've had just about enough of being alone. *sigh* Being single is so overrated. Take care of yourselves. IM me, I'll be waiting for that Mr. Right until he contacts me. Hopefully you're him. The ONE.

      Ironic much that both Jared and me have the exact same rose?  See Look below...   Your soul is bound to the  Glass Rose : The Fragile.   "My heart lies somewhere between perfection and dust.  And while my soul is a sight to behold, I shatter at the blink of an eye."   The Glass Rose is associated with perfection, beauty, and frailty.  It is governed by the goddess Aphrodite and its sign is the Looking Glass, or Tenuous Love.  As a Glass Rose, you have a beautiful soul and naturally attract people to you.  Love comes naturally to you, but it hardly ever lasts. Though you embody the perfect form of love, your own faults are your own undoing.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      So, I went to my German teacher’s house for dinner and some conversation.  She heard of me making out with Thomas at the Homecoming Dance and how I was dating bois.  She had the audacity to tell me that I am sinning against God and quoted the Bible and told me I was going to hell for being gay.  I am like ‘hello,’ I didn’t choose to be gay at all, it happens!  It is like my eye colour I didn’t choose it.  I have hazel eye b/c that is my eye colour.  Jeebus, she gave me a frickin’ headache!  I swear!  I am soo pissed.  So, I took some Napyrson and a little nap at Sam's and went home to talk to Jared. He is sooo comforting, another great qauilty of him!  Wow, I feel sheepish: is that a word? I hope so because then I would appear stupid if it wasn't...  I don't care what Frau said. You know what?  Watch out world here comes a flamer!!! I am gonna fall asleep early because I had been up for 44 hours and I was tired as shite.  Shite isn't that a type of Muslim? I am so sexually frustated right now  ... I wish to f someone's brains out alas I can't because I am home from school because I am and tired and don't have the person I wish to have here with me so I will wait until Januray.  *wink, wink, nugde, nudge, tap, tap (smiles)* I a gonna go right now I will write more soon though... I will add more later!!! Much heart to Jared!

      Lol, Jared you rock my crotch, as well as my heart, and mind and now even my hand is rocked by you.  So, thanks to the fabulous Jared, I have two poems today *Gasps!* I ran the mile yesturday and got 6:39, not that great but not to shabby!   I really kicked my ass hard when running damn this being a flexible individaul. Hahas, it was great times.  I talked to Jared's best friend Josh, he is a really nice guy, honest and funny as could be.  I remind Jared of his ex... Little creepy, neh? He says it is all good, and I trust him!  So about me being more flexible I did my yoga excerises!!! *Dances happy dance*  I got to pose 157 before I was tired,and the answer is yes to all that think to ask that question, no need the answer is *stands proudly* "yes, I can and what about you?."  Jared may come to Virginia soon *More happy dancing*  It would make me happier than a fat child in a candy store, of he came to see me! *drools lost in my little own world, (Jared you can join me if you like)..............* Ohh, where was I?  I don't reminder... well fine then to the poems...  The Club Dancing to the beat, circling in the clubs Circling amidst all of these club boy dubs Wondering if there is ever one not here for sex Scribbling messages of “---- me now” into text Questioning what I am doing here and now Taking in about all the vulgarities I would ever allow Grinding against one thousand and one losers All about “He’ll suck me off,” sex-cruisers While I for that one special someone seek Turning around there is one, sexy and meek Blonde hair in the way of sparkling green eyes Small stature I shuffle over nearer after many tries Watching him, small and cute, shifting his weight Staring all the while, internally I contemplate Standing here and now like water in the candle Thoughts over him, this is all that I can handle Slowly and surely, I place myself nearer still Gazing, watching all the more, my heart slowly starts to fill I brush against him: he turns and gives an affable smile My heart soars more and more all the while We turn together and dancing, wildflowers in my mind This one guy, green eyes aglow is the one I came to find I turn and ask him with my eyes if he feels the same He tells me that the burning heart he came to tame Silent questioned answer, my waist he wraps his arm Internally more and more chimes my alarm Filled by desires, he starts to caress, releasing scents At that point I drop all of my armaments I put my arms around him, thinking all the while “yes” He reaches slowly, gently down to my chest Our hearts intertwined, knowing we are right  Slowly moving downwards, his hands slide, holding tight He reaches firmly upwards and slides his mouth to my neck Desire for each other, different then the rest, burns like heck Our hearts swell like mad, 1 a.m. knowing that we must part Knowing fully that we are meant to be, together one heart My number to him with my heart, and his to mine  It is true and sad, shame to have so little time But, we know that we are meant to be off of first sites	 And, from now until forever, no more lonely nights   Eternal Rose A simple flower, pure and true Conjuring thoughts of me and you A flower stunning, beauty anew Alluring scent drawing me towards you A striking flower, glistening with dew Shining droplets like tears for you A flower beautiful, radiating through Reminding me of the warmth of you A budding flower, like a child’s coo Creating orgasmic feelings of you A flower scintillating, for me and you Tell me you will be the one to say “I do”

      Jared, OMG boo you are such a great muse!  I swear I haven't wrote happy poems in quite a while... I will get to the poem in a minute... BUT FIRST my day... I was completely outed in my culinary class.  Like I was talking to this girl, Marisol and she asked if I was gay, and I was like yep I am.  So then, CJ and this other boi named Alvin ran around and was like Will is gay, so the of course like the whole class asked me if I was gay and I was like well yeppers!  So then all of the class was like how do you have sex, and I was like orally and anally how else would I have sex? And they freaked it was great! I got my grades with 11 days of absences I still got above a 3.0 GPA for this nine weeks, GO ME!!! So now to my new poem again thanks Jared, you are a greaaaaaat inspirer! Much love cutie!  In your...  Graceful is the world that which we spin In your embrace, I am tempted to sin Delightful is the paradise that we hold In your arms, I could never grow old Peaceful is the heaven that you have made In you kiss, I know love will never fade Tranquil is the place that blocks all outside noise In your gaze, I play with you alone no longer toys Wonderful is the rapture that is all for us In your watch, I can fulfill all of my lust Lovely is the site that is only for you and me In your grasp, I know that I truly I am free Restful is the place in which you and I exist In your heart, I know I will always subsist      ~~Will

      Tehe, I started writing again!!!  It is all thanks to my great friend Jared.  Love your site, boo! A little update life is a bitch... Can't go to NSLC Medicine and Health Academy, my parents don't have the cash... BOO!  Well, it isn't like many peeps have $1825 dollars lying around, But I am pissed because they broke another promise... But, anyways tehe... Jared thanks so much sweetie this is for you!  Glass Rose  This fragile rose is for the brokenhearted A symbol of love that is always departed This fragile rose woven of simply most pure glass A symbol of civility and of heartbreak's great mass  The petals are laden with suffering and of pain Like being caught soaking from all pouring rain Glistening water droplets burden it with fears Like most many times alone we shed our tears This rose of clarity, spoiled, scratched up from all of the abuse Like all the many that we have loved that simply were obtuse Thorns once sharp dulled all the way through Like many loves that remind us to start anew The leaves once brilliant emerald have dulled to jade Like scars of love's battles with simply our own aide  The stem fractured slightly from all lost love Gives us hope still like wings of a white dove This rose even in its deteriorating condition Reminds us of love's great renewing position This rose still stands, true and strong as can be That love is still there amidst all of our adversity A poignant reminder of freedom and we can simply start up again If only you find, that one person that fits perfectly into your hand  Love yall!~~Will

The kitchen was flooded, the drawers filled with wather, the floor, the laundry room, the counters, I mean flooded!  Totally, so I call Sam to help me clean up the water.  Shane and Sam come and help me sweep out the water, drain the drawers, and at the end I fell twice and was like soaked!  So, it is interesting, ummm yeah!

      So, yesturday was interesting!  Sam, Shane, Michael, and I got together and was jus' chillen. Then we went to get the christmas tree! WootWoot!  It is all pretty!  White lights with simple silver and blue decorations and and and it is 7 and 1/2 feet tall!  So, we went to make cookies and Samantha was in charge of them and well.... She can't cook worth shyte.  The first set of batter was like hard as a frickin' rock, to the point that it stuck to the electric mixer in this big ball of stuff.  It then would alllow us to get out the dough so we tossed the bowl and the dough into the garbage...  then the second batch she decided to add milk which wasn't in the recipe at all!  So then these cookies thened out running, I was like great! Lol, I needed that, so she puts them into the oven and the nice fishy smell comes out of the oven as they are cooking.  So we pull them out when they are done and there are the ugliest cookies in this entire world!  So, they stuck to the pan as well....  And so we named them scratch-and-sniff cookies.  Lol, when Sam told me this I decided to really scratch-and-sniff them, and may I say I am not blonde.  I didn't fall for the scratch-and-sniff sticker on the bottom of the filled bathtub!  Although I was very tempted... It was banana!  So, anyways then we had to drop Mike off at his house  *tear* I was having fun, he is really cool! Gosh! I mean he has some issues that I want to help him with. I care a lot about him and all of his life's drama is sooo unnecessary and unwanted. I swear that he is someone who doesn't deserve this negative treatment. So, anyways then we went back to my house with Shane and Sam and the doorbell rings and I rush to the door and slid on the wood floor and and hit my arse flat on the ground. And, while me and Sam were making smores in my fireplace Chris called and I talked to him, he is also a cutie! But, then one of the cutiest guys here in Virginia Beach, the closet-case calls! OMG, I loved talkin' to him! Lol, I fell again this time out of my chair when on the phone and eating smores, it was very talented. I loved my fall.com! I wrote another poem for Jared! Tehe, long time, no writing for poetry, so yet again Jared inspired me again!    Waiting  Across the distance, 1,100 miles  I wait with heavy heart  Knowing your voice makes me smile  Only more 30 more days to keep us apart   Only 30 more days to stop us from it  Although I would wait 20 plus years more  I still can't wait to see your face when I open up my door  I would hope that you wouldn't with to quit   Only 300 more days till we will greet  To the time once your sparkling green eyes, to mine meet  I can't wait to feel your embrace  To look up and smile and stare at your sweet face   Only 30 more days to I can enjoy your company  Laughing, giggling, and so much more glee  I can't wait to hold on to you tight  And, to fall asleep with you in my arms at might   Across the distance, 1100 miles plus  I am waiting with my heavy heart  Know you can please me  And in thirty days we will be

      So, a lot has been going on with me...  So, Debbie like fought with me over what china I was allowed to use.  I mean come on do you pull out enough expensive china to feed a ientire frickin' black Bapist choir!  So, anyways she had dishes galore!  Saucers, tea pots, coffee cups, wine goblets, water glasses, 7 different types of forks and spoons, dinner plates, salad plate, dessert plate, soup bowl, side bowl...  I was like OMFG!  And, then she yells at me for eating appetizers as the turkey was cooking!  I was like I will eat trust me, grarrg! So, then to the hospital with my father.  I saw a guy that was transporting a heart!  It was like sooooo cool! So hmmm,... on my way back from Richmond, Virginia after my horrible Thanksgiving we stopped at a rest stop, where one of my exes was!  He walked up to me and started talking we exchanged numbers and when we got to Virginia Beach we called eachother and got together on Friday and on Saturday...  (Yes, we had hot, passionate monkey scarging).  So, then Michael's friend Jessica broke up Michael and Anne's relationship because she wanted Anne and Micheal wanted me!  *smiles* Lol, so they broke up with the oppisite sex for same sex relationships.  Tehe!  So, Michael is for me *Does happy dance* Then, Michael and I talked on the phone until like 1am-ish.  I feel really horrible about the Bryan thingie... I was the one that should have said no, but I was sooooo caught up in the moment that I didn't and now it is a mere f---, nothing else I feel so bad and his age is another thing.  13-/14 is too young, and he was not very nice afterwards, so Bryan you suck!  Jared you are soooo great!  You know this!  You are such a nice person and i hope you aren' to mad at me... Jared got my package in the mail, so that was good and makes me happy because it had some decent stuff in there, lol! I get one from him soon!  Well, the bell is ringing so I must part late!  Much Love

        "Home is behind The world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadow To the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow Cloud and shape   Hope shall fail All shall fade"         On a completely unrelated topic, (no, really- Goths do not really want to hang themselves), some new and obviously very controversial study was published by some guy – whose name I don’t remember –who claims that suicide can be positively correlated with intelligence — in other words, the smarter people are, the more likely they are to kill themselves. Whenever something like that surfaces, I can’t help but feel mildly offended, being still alive and all. Anyway! It would explain why geniuses often end up offing themselves, and I ‘m not planning on it. Much. But I digress.       So. that guy argues that the higher rate of Western suicide could be because people are, on average, more intelligent in the Western world. He’s compared national IQ levels with suicide rates. And the thing is, wherever you look, and whatever the culture, the same pattern can be seen: in Azerbaijan, Greece, Kuwait and Chile there are lower average IQ levels and lower suicide rates; in Austria, Korea, Singapore and Norway there are higher average IQ levels and higher suicide rates. He claims that for suicide to take place, a certain threshold of intelligence must be crossed.       I say, balls, yes you need some balls. First of all, writers, psychologists and philosophers have long argued over the reasons for suicide. The problem is that statistics on the subject are notoriously slippery. Take seasonal variations. I’ll bet anything that more people will feel the attraction of the six-storey building on a cold February morning in Hull than on a sunny August day in, let’s say, Cannes. Winter blues, climate and light and all that. Apparently suicidal thoughts reach a peak in January (when the Samaritans get most calls).       Yet in the West the peak months for actual suicide attempts are, universally, April, May and June. Yeah, I had a boifriend who, in April, illustrated that data pretty well. Also, most sociologists have argued that high suicide rates are caused by modern Western life — that something in urbanized, industrialized society alienates us from friends, faith and family, the mainstays of human happiness. Ok, fine. I’d give faith a beyond-the-religious definition. So, I’m tempted to add that it’s not intelligence but self-awareness that, in my mind, pushes someone to suicide. Self-awareness, which comes, often but not always, with education – of which intelligence is only a corollary. The more educated we are, the more able to see just how crap it all is? What about the dissatisfaction growing into despair at the constantly growing gap between what we have and what we want, in a world when the condition to happiness is to be just about everything the media we created throw at us?  Well this is not very clever; I just got myself all depressed now.   The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals, and 362 to heterosexuals. This doesn't mean God doesn't love heterosexuals, it's just that they need more supervision.    You know when you hear something that you find astonishing, but then when you think about it for a while you wonder whether it’s really obvious and that you have just been a bit dense? A recent example of this in my life is the realization that the pub in Eastenders is called the Queen Victoria and it’s in (Prince) Albert Square. Wow! On a wider scale my mate Dave never noticed that it is ladies who have boobs and men who generally don’t. (He’s looked a right twat wearing a bra for the last 2 years.)  The point of the story, I was flabbergasted to learn over the weekend that it isn’t just a tiger’s fur that is striped – their actual skin is striped too! (Does everyone know that??) Tigers have evolved to be naturally camouflaged, enhancing their chances of survival. Genius. Their prey does not see them coming, so they have a better chance of getting hold of some lunch. Hunters and their (few) predators have enough hassle finding them.  That got me thinking about how shit us humans are. Why don’t Aboriginals in the Australian outback develop skin the colour of the scrublands to blend in? Why don’t bee-keepers develop tough sting-proof skin? Why don’t cyclists develop glow-in-the-dark skin and extra hard heads?  I can only conclude that humans are not only rubbish, we’re endangered.

      Seriously, look how much I write in this thing. I think I've got the capabilities, now I just need something to write about. If anyone has any ideas, tell me.  Can I first start by saying: A yogurt parfait for only a dollar? I AM Lovin It! Anyways, its nice to see places like McDonalds, Subway, etc, trying to lighten up their menus for the health concious eaters out there. I think, however, that it really isnt doing any good. Winconsin has some of the most impressively fat people I have ever seen. It’s almost as if there is an award for gaining the most weight...like a pie or something. I will now ask the question that I can never answer...How do you let yourself get to be so big that you can barely make it up a flight of stairs?? I'm not sure whats worse, wondering what those people look like naked, or knowing that there are freaks out there (chubby chasers) that actually get off on a person that size.  I mean I like a little meat, no obese, not really skinny, above my weight is fine.  It you are like more then 50+ over me then we have a problem.  I think I will work in a factory one summer during college because The good part would be that I could see first hand what I could expect if I never finished college and knocked my old lady up. It was a good idea. I would be there hearing all about the lady at the tapping machine who happened to be dating a man of color and to hear all about how "wrong" it was, and how sad it was that such a  "catch" could be dissing her race to date someone outside of it. I also could meet a worker who sort of did everything. I might be paired up with him to haul some tables out of a room. During the 2 hours I spent with this guy he went from "Hi, my name is____" to "Yeah, you no whut I luv....fat gurls" (I spell the way this guy probably would have as an ode to him) "The bigger tha better". A chubby chaser that stood about 5'6" and weighed a hefty 130lbs.  So this leads me to another question not unlike the fat person question. What makes a person think that they can begin to unload that kind of information within a few hours of meeting someone? I understand letting it slip that your wife is a supermodel. Maybe I would try to work into the conversation how I saved a man’s life the previous week. Possibly, I would try to squeeze a mention of my millions made at poker, but explaining you’re racist??? Explaining what type of women you like to have sex with??? What leads these types of people to blurt this stuff out? So before I go, I just wanted to let anyone who may have just started reading this within the past few hours.... I use the word retarded a lot. Just a coupla thangs... Jeopardy seems to be getting really lax. I was watching and they had the category biography which was sort of like video clues each time. There seemed to be no time limit on answering and then for a daily double the lady waited, and waited, and waited...then finally, instead of a buzzer, Alex calmly said Rita? What has this world come to? Also there is a Seinfeld on that made me wonder. It’s the episode that Elaine and Jerry decide that they will make up rules and start to have sex as friends. So who would you pick of all your friends to bestow this honor on? I think I would have to think about this for awhile. It’s a difficult decision. It’s a really narrow pool to choose from. Well, I guess I will make a decision. I can see that the world is on the edge of their seats.  All of you! You are now entitled to some pretty exclusive benefits. I have an intimate knowledge of the genito-urinary region thanks. I live 1,100 miles away from my closest friend so I am always "looking for a good time". I've seen some porn lately and think I have figured out some things. I've yet to meet anybody with longer fingers than I have...and you know what that means. My fingers are double jointed and flexible. And you know what that means!  NOTE: I just wanted to apologize to my mom if she happens to  read this....just trying to be funny mom..Sorry.

        "Getting Screwed While Everybody Else is Getting Laid"    Bother  Wish I was too dead to cry  My self affliction fades  Stones to throw at my creator  Masochists to which I cater   You don't need to bother  I don't need to be  I'll keep slipping farther  But once I hold on  I won't let go 'till it bleeds   Wish I was too dead to care  If indeed I cared at all  Never had a voice to protest  So you fed me shit to digest   I wish I had a reason  My flaws are open season  For this I gave up trying  One good turn deserves my dying   Wish I'd died instead of lived  A zombie hides my face  Shell forgotten with it's memories  Diarys left with cryptic entries   And you don't need to bother  I don't need to be  I'll keep slipping farther  But once I hold on...I'll never live down my deceit.    I've always had this personality that I can look like that nothing is bothering me. I can swap stories with anyone and even try to be the lively one in a conversation. But this is sometimes just try to make noise cause when the silence comes, so does that sadness. Here recently, I've been having two basic emotional states from which to operate... sobbing and flat-lining. Either I'm so filled with sadness that I can't keep from sobbing or feeling the urge but no tears will come from it, or I'm unable to feel anything but empty.   I heard once 'fake it till you make it'. I think that's where I am. It makes life a little harder, maybe, because I'm still expected to do the things I'm expected to do, though the world does allow quite a bit of leniency. I'm still expected to tend to my duties. I'm still expected to be respectful. I'm still expected to function. Sometimes the functioning is the hardest part. Submitting, being respectful, tending to my duties... those are a breeze, compared to functioning.  I know there is a name for this, and I know that name is depression. I also know that most people who don't suffer with it won't understand. People will say 'Oh, he must not be happy” or, 'oh, he's not really a submissive there is something wrong.   People don't understand that depression is a chemical imbalance. It's not just an emotional thing. Emotions are chemical driven. Synapses fire in parts of the brain, chemicals are released, and you feel a certain thing. When that's not functioning properly, you feel things that aren't rational.  I've been depressed all my life, and mostly no one's really ever understood that about me. I had a teacher in my old high school who would lurk in her classroom door until I was passing and lunge out at me and say 'SMILE'. I finally told her that I would smile when there was something to smile about. And that's just it. There's not always a reason to be smiling. I have a neutral zone, and that's where I generally wait. When something happens that deserves a smile, I smile. When something happens that deserves a frown, I frown. Then I go back to my neutral zone. People don't get that. This teacher certainly didn't get that. She was forever hounding me to smile. She even went so far as to keep me from getting the 'congeniality' award because I didn't smile 'enough'. Every other teacher in the school wanted me to have the award, and she was on the award council, and vetoed it, so I didn't get it. I didn't think one thing about it until someone told me she was the reason I didn't get it. Then I was pissed, and certainly didn't feel like smiling.   I meet a girl who was always smiling. Whenever you'd ask her how she was, she'd beam 'fantastic'. The thing was, she often told me that she always answered that way, no matter what. Said she felt if she said it enough, it would happen. But with people like that, I feel like you can't truly trust them to tell you the truth, about more than just how they feel. You know, when I ask someone how they are, I want an honest answer, just like I do when I ask someone if an outfit looks right on me. Maybe that's where I'm different from most people though. Maybe 'how are you' is just lip service for the majority of the world. I don’t give the honest answers either. I wish to and in person I will but the net you don’t really know them, and I assume I will leave the façade.   I've been hospitalized, but I've taken different medications over the years. Never anything for long term, simply because circumstances tended to prevent that from happening, but I've been in rough spots before.   I feel like I'm just venting right now, and it makes me feel a little guilty, but I'm mostly doing a free thinking/writing/typing thing, and just letting it come out. I think that's what I need right now anyway.  I've started to notice that I have a tendency to try to save the world when I need to be saved. It's weird. When things get hard for me, I guess I try to distract myself by trying to take care of everyone else who's having a hard time. It doesn't work for long though, and I usually go overboard and deplete myself more, which just results in me being a basketcase. I could have gotten a lot done in the house in those almost three hours but I didn’t. My day would have been a lot less hectic had I just not done it.ger, stay strong a little longer, and will eventually help them live through their illness, into health.

        Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me. Never loved so true that once turned all my grey skies blue. But you disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears. And I'm wishing you were here with me.    When you get too angry to blog, you know it's time to calm down. Nothing at work is worth getting that upset about. Or so I keep telling myself. And it's not related to the removal of the dill-pickle flavored potato chips in favor of the low-carb pork rinds in the cabinet.   To Mike (a perspective from a pen): Tonight I’m feeling a little bit like that expensive pen. The one from Borders that was twenty dollars for ink that glides across a page. It was a nice enough pen. Not the loveliest you’d ever seen, but you had a paycheck burning a hole in your pocket that day. So, the pen came home with you, and the burning in your trousers was quickly extinguished. At first, you used it passionately. Feverishly trying to jail every fleeting thought between the prison bars created by college ruled lines. They were, like me, glad to surrender themselves to your presence if it would mean they wouldn’t be forgotten. Time wore on, and you found yourself with a problem. Nearly all the words had been captured so that when you wrote, the ink from one would dry before you could ever find another. Yet, you kept that pen close: an instrument to draw them out of hiding. You never knew when inspiration would come, so it was best to always be ready. With the pen kept snug in your pocket, far away from the hands that once allowed it to create, you waited and went about life until one day you’d forgotten what it was you were ever looking for. The pen became mixed with all the others at the bottom of its cloth pit (a thumbtack named Damien, a broken pencil named Evan, a wilted flower named John). Finally, the only promise- to not be forgotten- was pulled out and dropped tonight with some spare change while you purchased the only things you could ever commit to: your cigarettes and a lottery ticket.  Yes, tonight I feel a little like that pen- convenient until it became a painful reminder of the things you couldn’t be and eventually forgotten.  Don't I am not bitter if fact jus' disappointed.  :>The Two Of You :>Reminising :>Time Before Now :>Far And Away :>Fighting All Along  Do me a favor Provide some relief Make me go deaf Make my tongue dry Make these eyes go blind Make my fingers go numb Make my lips no more move Make all feelings incomplete Smother all my senses This pain no more  I will have to conceive

        For you aren't the one who knows me true For you aren't the one smiling through and through For you aren't the one to touch my heart For you are the one to make it fall apart    I think I love winter, but I'm not sure. I think winter is the kind of season that you like when it's a different season but hate when you're in it. Like summer. What I wouldn't give for a 85 degree day, no icy wind. But I know that when it's 96 for the fifth straight day with burdensome humidity and I've sweated through my third tee shirt of the afternoon, I will look fondly back at old man winter. The idea of winter just sounds so snuggly and cosy -- you drink hot chocolate, beautiful snow everywhere, a fire, Bing Crosby singing old standards, a puppies, flannel pajamas, bears hibernating, the works. Of course the reality of winter is much more harsh than homey, cruel rather than comfortable. The only seasons that you can honsetly enjoy when they're happening are spring and fall, which is of course not to say that they don't have their drawbacks as well. Namely, rain. Truthfully, in a 365 day year, I'd say only 25 days are what I would consider "ideal" weather, another 50 are "nice", 100 "tolerable", and the rest fall in the range of "bad" to "apocalyptic".  P.S. If it's a leap year, the extra day becomes freezing rain by default.  In the one month that I have been in Winsconsin I have gained an appreciation for the friendships I had before I came here and the ones I have newly acquired. I never realized how much I took a few of my closet friends for granted and expected them to be there whenever I needed them. I don't think I told them enough how much they meant to me! I know now, that the friends I have now I'll most likely have in ten years and I think I've got myself a pretty special bunch! So I'll leave you with these quotes "There is a point in life when you realize who matters, who never did, and who always will." and "Treasure your friendships, not your possessions." Those quotes speak a lot, and we should all listen to them. There may come a time where you need to figure out if you want certain people in your life and at the end of the day when you have a few friends left, will you be happy? I was full of grief. Just a weeks earlier, I was filled with all the joys of love. Falling into love. How is it, that the world have become such creatures of complicated emotions? And the name of love had been wrongly maligned - till it has become a mere round of guessing game? What drives people to be so dishonest about their deepest thoughts? Honesty is a simple thing to achieve. Truths are, by nature, simple. To lie is a difficult thing indeed - because lies and deceptions are difficult children to keep. They are twisted and ugly, and after a while, lose themselves. Children of truth are, on the other hand, free to roam and grow as they want.  I sincerely hope all my friends and loved ones find honest love - honest happiness, maybe it would be else where. (minus one guy)  I can’t please people like I did.  I can’t be the best individual in fact I may be the worst.  I am not like before, I am not a foolish, love is a blessing not a curse but to me it is because with it comes my own destructive tendencies. I ruined things for a lot of people.  I hope I am not now.  I've always wondered... How would I spend my time if I had all the time to myself, without work, without T.V., without the computer? For some people, perhaps many people, work defines them. Or rather, what they do, defines who they are. I beg to differ. What people do defines what they are. Not who. Yet when we're faced with just ourselves, a simple life without distractions, that's when we'll realize who we are. That path of discovering oneself must be sought by oneself, and ironically, it is when there are no more things to do, no more distractions, no more deadlines, that this path can be trodden on. I've filled out my life with too much activity. I hope I can realize who I am soon.  Life is a matter of getting past two extreme ends - that's when you'll know where the balance is. That's where the middle point stops.  I'm not real sure what I'd like to make out the situation, but I do know I'd like to make something. You see, too often does something come up and hit me in the face, I feel my cheek, and then wonder what just happened, not turning my neck to see what is  scampering off. Maybe I'll look this time. No, maybe not. Well, maybe if it would just stay put. What if it did though? Would it be beautiful? Or just... awkward? Sometimes I get scars, a glimpse of what could have happened. I wish I knew what to do. I wish someone would hold my hand, tell me it was going to be okay. Just go for it. Turn the corner, it’s there. I don't want to. I'm fine in this hallway. No. Yes. No. Yes. No.  No. No. I can’t be, you can’t be. How'd I get here anyway? Was there a door? I see and I think it'll be grand. I think and I know it won't. Which lies more, your thoughts or your own sight? I guess there's only one way to find out. I guess there's only one way to never know too. That's quite the predicament, isn't it? I've got 3 days to figure it out. No, I've got more. Maybe less. We never really know do we? Live for today, they say. Tomorrow looks bright too, they say. Yesterday was nice. Looks like its all rosy, but its not really. No not today, anyhow. Maybe tomorrow, tomorrow looks bright. That's what they said yesterday, that's what they'll say tomorrow, but its true today, if not, it'll be tomorrow...or was it yesterday? One day. That's for sure. One day.  Now next year has come, all the promises I made to myself made again- only this time I have the experience needed to grasp them. The same expectations made, yet realistic now instead of cosmic dreams. I have been taught that failure is the strongest form of education if you learn from your mistakes, but I would argue it is the only pristine form. Every fact, every experience, every thought, is subject to revision, to recapitulation, to revalidation from its original state. To fail is to be human, to fail to learn from failure is ignorance. As I go into another round of competition, I take with me the remembrance of last year's defeat. I take with me the knowledge that to strive without improvement is folly.   I really really dislike it when people jump to conclusions about me. Don't they understand that they just can't assume things by looking at the surface of it? That's way too superficial. When people do certain things and make certain decisions, they do have their reasons behind it, reasons that the other people may not know of because they didn't care to find out. So, isn't it very unfair for someone to judge someone else just by what they do without learning why they did it?   It is. why people just can't understand that I'm not abandoning my friends to go with my new friends? I am not doing activities without consent and help on it.  All I ask for is some understanding.

      I am so tired today, tired and full. If I continue this eating-every-other-day business, I am going to make hippopotamuses envious at my widening girth... hrmmpfh... The mere thought pisses me off.  I stapled my finger today by freak accident.  And last night our chickens decided not to go in their coop after the sunset, so me and my stepmom had to wedge the chicken and chase them around the enclosure, the first time half went in, then we chased them the other way and Francealitta (the one that knocked down the lamp and fought me for ten minutes) decided to escape by pushing on the gate, and to spite me whenever I took a step she would to, so i was like fine.... WHATEVER!  I dived at her missed she ran on the top of my head, pecked me and ran down my back, and into the pen, stupid chicken!  Damn that hen!  When I was younger I refused to be like any of those boring women 'Typical women' I would lament And I was definitely more special than them Guys who attracted me were men with wild ways Some artistic, many others suave and weird in all their own ways But all of them One common characteristic. None was ready to settle down And definitely all had the most interesting excuses Speaking of marriage Maybe true love was like that Marriage is suffering, it kicks a couple into death's grave. Something in me quivered Yes, a tiny voice. When enough was enough I took heed of that voice. And never regretted since. A secure man gives secure love True and steady as the man himself His love is faithful not trying to impress and brings you to that green green pasture under a million stars. Looking in the mirror I see the teenage me lamenting on the typical, boring person in the mirror I grinned, almost speaking aloud "Boi, you'll learn" What you want in a man Is not wild excitement For true love is not defined by the unknown Not mysteries and thrills But the things a man makes known.  Did you also know that in order to have a nativity scene in public you also have to include santa, reindeer, candy canes... etc. BUT if you want to have santa and all that other good stuff you don't have to include the nativity scene, because it's christmas stuff.... isn't that rediculous??? Britney Spears Got married to her friend Jason Alan Alexander... no one cares she's is an adult! Illegal immigrants still shouldn't get licenses or work at fast food restaraunts, but that's self explainatory Two fighter jet planes escorted a plane to a special part of an airport because a lady had wires sticking out of her jacket (wires with negative and positive... not just like a phone jack...) She just had wires in her jacket... maybe she liked them... or thought they were imaginary friends... wouldn't that be creepy? A person afraid of flying looking out the window and you see these fighter jet planes... ooh la la The croc hunter... and his baby... feeding an alligator to make get his baby to be familiar with alligators or something.. ya he pulled a michael Jackson  It's hard to say this in a way that's comprehendable. but I guess I'll try. I just want to have one person who will stay with me forever, or at least a long time. And I always think... Choose the guy because in the end you have a husband not a boifriend you know? But  I have been left only BY guys. Most friends stay with me. I always say that your friends will grow away from you. But in my case, it's always me that grow away from my friends. I have hurt a lot of people in that way. and I didn't realize what a hipocrite I was being. but I have a best friend now and it just makes me think... "Is he gonna do to me, what I did to all the people I hurt?" And I really hope not cause he is my only sanity. But he has difted. If he wasnt' there I would die before I got to where I want to be... but he isn't reaslly there, he has his own and I am out.. But I hate the fact that I think about this all the time. I am always scared that me and him are gonna have another one of our famous falling-outs. I really don't wanna lose him as a best friend. He and I understand each other completely and we have all the same friends and the same taste in everything and we even dislike the same people. But I guess I "stole" him away from his other best friend. So in the end I guess I would get what I deserve. and maybe im just paranoid, or maybe its happening, but I just feel like we're nearing something... maybe its just we're coming soo close and everything is chaotic and apprehensive. Or maybe we're coming to the end of the rope of friendship I have been hanging onto for the past weeks. But like I said maybe im just paranoid. I really hope Im just paranoid.  But I see that the rope is unraveling.

      It is really cold here (-1?F), and I think it is really great! The cold is so crisp, so invigorating; it wakes you up, heightens your senses (that is, of course, until you go numb...but we're accentuating the positive here!). The extreme cold is so very primal! Going outside is like an adventure, and I feel a bond with all the people I see while I am out. We are all out there enduring, nay embracing, the cold -- boldly venturing forth onto this wonderfully exposed prairie (area thingie what ever it is, damn you word screw up my spiel!) Anyways we are all exposed. That may be what it is that I like about the cold. You feel so exposed to the universe, like you really are walking about on the skin of this big planet that is spinning around in a big, cold universe. The sky above is large and crystal clear, and gone is the blanket of heat that normally presses upon us. Doesn't a really cold, clear night make you look up at the sky? Count the stars, trace the constellations, make your own.  And in the cold air looking at vast heavens you feel vulnerable and alone...and yet still connected? Whew!  INTENSE!  So, I had to take my pills so I had half a box of Oreos for breakfast w/ a nice big glass of milk to wash it down...Gotta love Oreos for breakfast, but I think I definitely ate WAY TOO many cookies, so I basically didn't eat lunch as a result. I can't wait to get back to school so that I'm not such a glutton, wait I am in school!  Dammit. I don't intend to bring much food so that I don't pig out like I do here, then I'll lose the pounds I've gained since coming here.    So, WINTERFEST CAME!  Like dude it was great.  First off Dominick, Darlene, John (whew), and Sara went bowling, which I won btw.  I got to grab John’s arse not once but twice and not a hand, full gropage.  Then we had to take him to work in the Dells, and then we went to Sara’s and played LIFE, were I was a doctor making $30,000, not the $100,000 I should have been, and I have two sets of twins: Jeron, Aaron, Darrin, and Mike.  And ummm my husband was the guy who had his butt groped for the name was a group effort.  ^^LOOK ABOVE IF LOST!^^  And, and, and I had the Tudor, that wasn’t paid for till I went to night school.  Then to get ready:  Darlene honey I am sorry I burned you not once but twice. Hunny, not intentional!  Haha, your forehead doesn't look to bad.  Sorry about those shakes.  I hope you get better!   Then to the dance:  Hehe, I am THE SLUTTIEST DANCER AT MHS! And of course I am the SLUTTIEST MALE!  Mrhahahahahahahaha! It was really fun and I thought I was cute.  I got to wear a tiara.   So anyways, I got to see my friend’s piano teacher.  Like wowwies!  He is HOTT.  That piano teacher I mean not my friend, well he is kinda hott! But the teacher is the 'lets-bang-on-the-piano' kinda hott. (Kinky are we?) Not the 'lets-bang-the-piano'. And seeing all the music rooms, the music being played, the recital hall, the people there, I felt such an incredible sense of belonging. As the different tunes danced through my head I was telling myself, this is where I belong; there is where I should be. It was a little bittersweet. Oh yeah, and did I mention all the hot music guys? OH MY GOD! Let me tell you, guys with artistic blood running through their veins give off a completely different air about them. It's so damned sexy.  But I have little musical talent, but I can enjoy the hell out of it!  Haha, I need to get to a show choir competition.  Whew!   So!  I played an interesting game of Scrabble. Due to the slowness of some players (like Me) I was able to think of new and innovating ways to make Scrabble fun and not so slow and boring. For example:  *clears throat* everyone has a glass window in front of them and a tiny hole to put their letters down to spell words. But wait! Everyone is equipped with a knife, so if a hand comes out, they can begin the slashing! So this means you have to have either fast hands or small words. And if they are small words, you will surely lose the game. This helps builds dexterity, and maybe even immunity to blood loss! However, not only is there physical trouble, but verbal trouble! Everyone/Anyone can say whatever they want. They can talk trash, how they slept with your mom, how stupid they are what words to put/not put, why they are even playing the game, etc... This part of the game helps build on learning how to block out everyone's voices, or how to make witty come backs in a span of a few seconds. ‘Cuz we all know that "your mom" is such a dumbass remark that only a faggot would say. However, a lot of people say that, thus meaning we have a lot of faggots in this world, which is very exciting!  More bois, is the words of Jeron’s card more toys.  (BLAH!)  Bois aren’t toys to me. So as you can see, this "Prison Scrabble" is training ground for people that want to be 1337 in every aspect. Possibly the only thing that you will lack after this game is your life, not too important.  And that's just a slight chance of 99%. So in reality, it's a good investment and a must buy game. And I am expecting to have tournaments by the end of the year. Hopefully Scrabble will accept this as another version that will help spread their wonderful name throughout the world.

       I could insert a video tape or at least a memory card into my brain, I'd record today's events and play it again and again. It would be easier then typing!    What can I do to make you mine? Fallen so hard, so fast this time What did I say, what did you do? How did I fall in love with you?      Don't Need No Hateration   I  hate George Bush. I hate being gay. I hate Hootie and the Blowfish. I hate this. I hate that. I hate you. Blah, blah, blah!  Wanna know what I hate? That God damn word hate. It's such a strong word. You can't get any more negative than hate. Using that word ruins perfectly decent conversation. Really, who wants to hang out with someone who's full of hate? It's depressing.  People tell me what you LOVE     Mrhahahaha! So, I so jus' found out that solidified milk fat is good! Merrmrr!!!      OMG,  Begeezus, somebody needs to disguise a ringtone as a car driving by, or an ambulance noise, or a guy coughing. A friend of mine suggested that another friend had a phone like her's, where one of the ringtone's is the sound of a cow, mooing. GEE! HOW UNSUSPICIOUS. GEEZUS, DID SOMEBODY BRING A COW INTO HIGH SCHOOL TODAY? WILL IS THAT A FUCKING COW DYING IN YOUR BAG?!  GOD, HELL YOU TOTE A MESSANGER BAG, IT’S LIKE A PURSE. IS THE COW IN THE KITCHEN SINK?  You mind as well change to a jellyfish, they bubble, that would be less noticeable then a slaughter house.  Some friend and I decided we'd be long-distance crushes. And while I know this is completely in jest it still made me smile and feel really good about myself. And maybe if it wasn't long-distance crushes it wouldn't be so much in jest, But I think the idea of someone liking me has become so foreign lately. I don’t get this much attention.  Why would I? it seems I've had so many of these one-off dates lately that go nowhere (no pun intended) or a couple two-fers that seem like they have potential then peter out into nothingness (again, no pun intended, honest. I've been quite the well-behaved child lately since the last year) so I think it's a little funny that like a jesting crush (on someone who's totally crushworthy, no doubt) could make my week. And these one-offs or two-fers say they want to be friends, or express interest in going out again yet it's all talk.  And I believe them every time of course, Ii fall for it every time hook line and sinker. Other people are so much better at just turning "it" off. Whatever!  The "it" was about me that drew them to me in the first place, they can turn "it" off just as fast as "it" was turned on. I think that's why I'm different. I invest a little more of myself in the other person, too much more, more than I should, all of this I know. and I'm trying to invest less of myself in people, Tell myself most people aren't worth it, and be more selective and I'm getting better but I guess lapses are made every once in awhile. But being the rejected one you can only try so much to get a friendship. Emails unanswered, phone calls unreturned, IMs to sudden away messages and its difficult, as the rejected one, in drawing that line. You want the other person to know that you are interested in a friendship if they are being genuine, but want to advance as such so the pains of rejections aren’t brutally obvious or that they know you're not clinging to some hope of reconciliation and a return to your previous form. And I think it's that rapid decline that makes things so much more difficult for me to deal with. I guess I haven't wrapped my mind around how you can mean a lot (or seemingly mean a lot) to someone one day, then nothing to them the next without any significant change taking place. NOT BITCHING, jus’ musing.   I can't seem to do a lot of anything right, but I am trying, to all of those that I have have hurt, I am sorry.  I seem to do so much that I need to stop and think what is life and how I wish to live it.  I have lied and cut and done all the things that was done to me in my past, those things I said I would never do, but these actions were in fear,  I am sorry I am not used to these feelings, not since I was thirteen, and briefly a little over a month ago with Michael, I fear that I am not what you wished for or wanted.  I am unrational I know, but it is my feelings.    Keeping up appearances Keeping up with the Joneses Fooling my selfish heart Going through the motions But I'm fooling myself I'm fooling myself 'Cause you say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries And then you do it again You do it again Everybody thinks you're well Everybody thinks I'm ill Watching me fall apart Falling under your spell But you're fooling yourself You're fooling yourself 'Cause you say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries And then you do it again You do it again  And again and again and again and again Oh, but you're fooling yourself You're fooling yourself 'Cause you say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries Then you do it again You do it again You say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries Then you do it again You do it again  And again and again and again and again  This is me and I am sorry, I am trying soooo hard to break my fears and try to live, but it is really hard, my pattern is set and I need help and understanding to break the mold.   I am tired already, and I have activities for Winterfest to do… Only thick coffee has the answer! Can someone wake me up at 9 later? Hehe! No... I'd rather have someone pick me up off the floor.

      Wootwoot! Guess what, guess what! It is my half-birthday I am now 16 and 6 monthes old!  *dances wildly, spinning and spinnning falls over with an amazing thud and laughs*  Haha!  So the question is who will remember?  Hmmmm?  We will see! ODD NEWS! So me and Josh were talkn’ and he was blabbing on and on and I asked him if for once he had something important to say and well he started off by telling me this interesting fact:  a 14-year-old from north "grass" Manchester England has been ordered by a "grass" judge not to say the word "grass" until the year 2010. If he says "grass" the boy could face 5 years in "grass" custody. Well, there goes that part time lawn mowing job. I wonder who will wish me a happy half-birthday

       How best can one live life but in the loving arms of one's dearest? How often does the heart beat in synchronous tune with every beat a harbinger of hope? How can one taste so sweet in the rising tempo of passion? To live, to love and to breathe together - as one... how many have the fortune?     Not too many it seems   Life is still the same, like things that happened to you in when you are six years old. Your world was Sesame Street, your rubber band collection, your favorite booger-stained t-shirt. You ate the paste, licking the stick; it tasted good, you didn't question it. Don't lie!  You did, you did, you did!  *stomps feet childishly* Ha, I win!!!.  And if your Mom decided to have an unholy alliance with your kindergarten teacher to cast you in a tacky school play, you didn't question that either.  Life plays out and you have little control.  But, that is fine it is all gravy, for you need to allow it to go!  It all works itself out.  So now I think I will now be able to catch up on all the trashy romance novels in the communal library in our laundry room, where we swap romance novels like swingers at a party. Don't yall?  What you don't *loser cough* But when the question comes to decide between a Silhouette Romance or porn, porn always seems to win out. Romancing myself is easy no awkward moments, no polite chit-chat. Just a quick encounter no deep feelings, just a few drops of tears at the end. Nothing a little Kleenex won't fix.  But when others romance me it is more difficult, you need to work at it, and I am not sure if it is really possible But, continue to try.   So I was doing some thinking, I wanna have a TWIN.  Being a twin, having someone who looks just like you, has its advantages. You can share discount cards, gym IDs, Hello Kitty fanclub memberships.  What don't lie, don't lie!!!!! You sooo want one! You can look at clothes objectively because you have someone who can wear it for you before you buy it. It means that you can eliminate bad fashion choices, unfortunate punk haircuts or being blonde without having to live through the embarrassment yourself. Being a twin means that there is someone who can read your mind without you saying a word. Yeah, and they say that if you are left-handed you would have had a twin that died before birth.  Damn you nature!!!  I WANT MY TWIN *stomps feet again* I do, I do, I do!  *continuously stomps* It is hard to overcome how society views us queers, but I will. I just wished I was able to go through it with my friends or family for that is the way it should be. Maybe it would have been easier. Maybe a lot less lonely.  Society still in smaller areas is so homophobic and turns against the different or the odd, it isn't fair and it isn't right, what have I done to deserve whispers behind my back?  Have I done anything wrong?  I am myself and that is all, but I will deal!  I really will!  	Lol, a couple thinks to chat about.  John is 99.99% gay, not bi, so sorry to him Geezzz, people are so hard to please.  *rolls eyes*

I went to the cadaver lab today!  Wootwoot!  OMG, this dead man was like all dissected, sorry, prosected, for they wish to preserve it. So  I got to work the levers to raise him up and I got to touch his aorta that was not squishy it was all hard and stuff (not normal!), and and and and umm….   umm… His butt was all nasty and filled with the alcohol that he was stored in and I had to help turn him over.  His face was all like there with hair and all!  Haha, he had nose hair. Nose hair, nose hair!  He sooo didn’t make me feel the need to throw up, the bus ride though, Begesuss! That man was dangerous; I would have lost my cookies (yes, I had some polish cookies before the dissection) if I had to ride that any more! And then we had a fire drill, it is soooooo chilly, my nipples got hard, Lol, haha it was nipplely!!!  So yeah!

      *sigh*  Well, I need a break from everything.  I really do!  I don’t know about what I am doing.  22 days into this state and I am crying more then I left.  My live, my place and everything about me in Virginia is gone, completely!  My ex Michael has a new love and he is an almost ex of mine, I kills me to help Eric out with Michael, I don’t want them to love, but I have to let go, but in isn’t like in Thailand when you release birds in the marketplace, they return to their cages but I know that Michael will not be coming back to me.  My heart is filled with such sorrow, like Virginia didn’t wish to have me anyways, but I want it.  School is moving on, and all is forgotten, my family moves on, all does but I am standing still, caught in the driving snow.  As the snow piles up, so shall my depression, and the rosy sunrise that breaks over the trees bears no effect on me, and the grace of a new day shan’t either.  I need a savior and I need him now, but I shall have to do this alone for fate shall show that this is only the end in Virginia.  That sun has set, and in Winsconsin it is rising but I simply need to forget and live anew, and if I don’t my worldliness shall slip away...

      So I got a stupid candy bar today. It was a snickers bar, and it really pissed me off. It was tiny as hell, but it said "fun size." What kind of STUPID logic is that? It is WAY more fun to eat the big one if you ask me. Everyone I would like yall to meet Josh my invisible friend. *claps echo throughout the room, cheers jar at people's ears*SO, He and I also got into an argument today. He asked me if they had Girls' bathrooms in gay bars, and I told him no because I honestly don't ever remember seeing the little sign thing even ON the stupid door. Not like it would REALLY matter though. The little sign for a girl's bathroom is that stick figure with a dress. Call it a queen and most gay guys would be happy.   Something to do to impress me: Change your name to Mr. Crunch and join the Navy. Then they can call you Captain Crunch. It will tickle my fancy.  I swear ever since I got here every gay guy I meet is practicailly shoving thier cock down my throat, I swear jus to all of them give it a rest!  i am sooo tired of trying and trying, it is soo hard!  I am not one to have sex without there being love.  I have been here only 19 days!

      I started school and OMG , There is no gay guy here, there is a bi guy and that is kewl but I don't know him for he is on vacation and I am not, so BOO! on him for not being here.  I wish, I wish, I wish, I have the aloneness that does occur when you are the only one a a type to be there. It is quiet. Kind of lonely, but I will deal. I always do. I'm scared that I won't make any friends, but the fairy that lives in my hair or head or both keeps telling me how likeable I am. I'm sure I will find a friend. Yes, a gay one maybe, or or or or or a short, fat, jolly, black girl named Jooplika, perhaps. Haha, or Frankwich a male yeah, he would be a jolly fat asian dude with odd shoes.  School rocks my socks.com.  I am in Anatomy/Physiology (I am disecting minks, hahaha!  I took it's eye out), Algrebra II (Blah! A review slack course), Chemistry (It's easy here, it is, it is), and Foriegn Foods (We cook consently!  Wootwoot!) So it is okay, only I need a date for Winterfest.... Any takers?  Lol, maybe Jon if Jeron can't, then there is TIM my bestiest friend!  Hmmm, well we will see Lata' gata'.  I really do miss Jared, I hope he is okay.  VA is quite, my ex has moved on, he is over me like that.

      Well Jeron (a new friend) came up to see me at like 6ish and we chilled at my house for a little and at 7 we went to drive to Mauston, well we never made it... There is this airfield and we went out on it together and well... yeah.  One orgasm there... Then we went back to my house at 9 and watched "A View from the Top" and well, we really didn't watch the movie because umm... yeah.  Another orgasm and then the third was like before the ball dropped.  And he got me Christmas presents and they were "My Favorites" Flowers and Leaves for Spring and Fall (seasons), a platypus stuffed animal (animal), a bottle of iced tea with lemon (drink),  a shotglass from a cheesecake factory (dessert), Mexican rice (food), a noise maker when I get laryngitis because I speak a lot.    AND NOW MY WI BEST FRIEND WISHES TO HAVE MORE THAN MY FRIENDSHIP:  Over the past two weeks or however long it has exactly been, I have fallen in love with you.  You are a very strong young man with a lot of drive and some definite goals.  You also have morals.  That's what attracted me to you the most.  Sure your stunningly good looks and beautiful southern accent don't hurt, but your personality has grabbed a hold of my heart and won't let go.  I have tried to let go of these feelings and I just can't do it.  I want you as a part of my life, Will.  I know you've said that you want me to be your best friend, but please, give that title to someone else.  I want to be the boyfriend in this situation.  I know I may not have Freddie Prinze Jr's great looks or Conan O'Brian's humor, but I am ME and I'm not afraid to give you every last part of me.  I love you, Will, and I am going to continue to love you no matter what you do that I may not approve of or how many miles come between us.  (Direct quote)   So my heart is torn and my body feels battered much like it did in Virginia.  God damn confliction of emotions seizing me up. I am sorry to all parties involved, I seems I always can fuck shyte up. Yep go Will! HAPPY FRICKING NEW YEAR!

      Would You Rather . . .  Pose nude once for a magazine for $10,000  —OR—  dance nude once a month for $5,000 a night?   Well if the nude pic thing was like for Playgirl or some tasteful gay magazine.  I would take the $10,000 dollars. But if it was one of those nasty SM mags I would have to pass. No shame here on this body. It's not perfect, but I don't know many real ones that are...so what the hell. But I will state that if the nude pic was something gross, I'll dance nude. Hell I do that at home now, I just don't get paid for it.  God!  My throat hurts, and for once it isn't like sex, but no I am all dried up, and scratchy and not fun at all!  I don't know why I am sick.  I am I guess that is all that matters, I had three popsicles before I came to school and when i entered the building I am utterly miserable.  *sigh* I will keep my mouth shut!   Wait Will quiet? Call the newspaper!   So, most people are afraid of death, I am not sure why.  Maybe the not knowing but we don’t know anything as it is now.  I know its something that you don’t need to trepidate over, its only bloodcurdling when you witnesses such things and not so scary.  I mean to say I have witnessed death in its purest form and even some less pure.  The witnesses are more traumatized then the individual that is doing the dying.  Most people I know that have died said while they were dying that it didn’t hurt.  Pain is arbitrary, fake and false as the smile on my face.  You are so indecisive in this world in which we don’t know up from down and right from left.  You never will know pain because it doesn’t live.  It isn’t real.   And I am right to an extent, sadomasochist and masochists they enjoy pain but pain is something that isn’t enjoyable, right?  Can you have pleasure from an injury?  I would say so, so pain isn’t a feeling but a mental state.  Sex is painful, but it offers pleasure.  How are we to sure about pain?  I mean I used to find pleasure in self-mutilation, in that pain, and it that ever really possible?   Creepy *Twilight Zone music*    THE GROCERY LIST FROM HELL   A trip to the grocery store is, in some ways, like a trip to the museum. There are many interesting items to look at. You can pick some things up and examine them. And some things are just so old they're practically relics. They really should make those "best before" dates a little clearer.  I'm in a list mood today. So here goes my list of grocery items that are never -- and I mean NEVER -- to be put on my grocery list.  I mean I eat them now becuase i am not in charge of the household, but when I do have my own I will not buy these items... INSTANT COFFEE- All advertisers for this product (name a brand, any brand) should have their offices raided and quarantined until they stop lying to us. You've seen the ads. The person waking up, making their coffee and enjoying it like it's the best damn beverage they've ever had. IT'S INSTANT, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! If I'm not mistaken, instant is latin for "it's easy to make, but it sucks." SARDINES- Yechh. Nope, not enough emphasis. YECHH!! Much better. I can't for the life of me figure out how people can stomach these. "Gee, honey. Are ya hungry? Howz about some crappy canned miniature fish?" GRAPEFRUIT- I'll put on my Chandler Bing hat for a moment. "Could these BE any more sour?"Besides lithium is a permament chemical in my blood... drrr! COTTAGE CHEESE- This stuff looks like it could be used as some sort of half-assed lubricant and has practically no flavour at all. (Sarcasm alert) I can definitely see the appeal. It's okay in lasagne, though. Put all the ingredients for lasagne next to it, and all will be forgiven. LIVER- It's rich in nutrients and will give you strong bones -- or something. No thanks. Given a choice, I'll take osteoporosis. MARGARINE- Anyone who would confuse this crap with butter needs their head AND their taste buds examined.  FISH STICKS- I liked these as a kid, but then what do kids know. OLIVES- I've seen these eaten like they were hors d'oevres. I tried an olive once (green, I think) and it had me wondering what the inside of an old rubber hose must taste like. PROCESSED CHEESE SLICES- Ugh, not in my fridge. Isn't it cute, though, the way fast food joints work the term "processed cheese" into their blurbs while describing how delicious their burgers are? Mr. Subliminal they ain't.  MARMITE/VEGEMITE- I actually love this stuff, but I've listed it because of the horrified looks I get when I eat it. You'd think I was eating from a cadaver, or something. I'm done for now. Thoughts from the masses? My ears are open. My mind is another matter, entirely. Stay tuned...

      On Saturday I continued past my early 20s and into my teens. See, I decided it would be a good idea to dye my hair. My hair has been looking kind of blah lately. About 8 months ago I dyed my hair black, thinking it would look kind of rich and dark and beautiful against my skin. It looked good (if I do say so myself), if not a little goth-like, and appropriate for winter.  As it is now approaching spring, I thought it would be kind of cool to go a little warmer. Perhaps a reddish, auburn sheen. I picked up a bottle of Feria and decided to go for it.  I didn't realize that if you haven't dyed your hair for a while, the growth at the roots, although not drastically different-looking from the bottom of your hair, will absorb dye very, very intensely. Much more intensely than the bottom of your hair. I pulled off the towel to discover that the red sheen I desired manifested as an intense, bozo red at the top part of my head, and the bottom half of my head was an even darker shade of black. It looked like I was wearing a strange, punk-like halo.  This was not the desired effect. Punk-like, I am not, I am but it was bad.  As I drove to the drugstore to purchase a darker brown dye to counteract the bozoness, I thought to myself, "How old am I? How is it that I am still having do-it-yourself hair disasters as a grown-ass?" I decided that an at-home hair disaster makes one officially 17.  Despite my hair fiasco, I have been seriously thinking about cutting my own bangs, thus bringing me back to age 14, then re-highlighted.  And now I want that punk look. At this rate, I'll be a zygote in 3 weeks.  Speaking of chemicals I’m going to go a little nuts over the man’s insistence that bleach must be used – not so much because I think that bleaching whites is evil or anything – but, being me, I’m naturally leery of anything that can ruin a nice pair of black pants of a favorite red shirt. These are things that do happen to me. Therefore I do think that bleach is evil, thus I will continue to be afraid of the bleach bottle/jug/thing anywhere near me, my stuff, or anything that might touch me or my stuff.  Obstuse  I'm going to make my own t-shirts. Thats right - I am looking for a new hobby and I have decided on t-shirts. so why have I decided to do this? Well for one I am tired of not finding t's that I like in the stores. Plain ones are boring, other people's patterns are brutal, and those "need head" shirts piss me off. Plus it'll be cheaper to make fun shirts that i see - thats right - I can rip them off and no-one will be the wiser.  I want also to be creative. I'm going to make a shirt with my resume on it and wear it to job interviews.  I can go into business. I can make "your band is a douche" shirts. We can play with them. I'll get license from that girl who made it first, then we'll sell them at Inside shows. HEY! That’s how I can go to Montreal. I can make a ton of shirts this week and then go as for a business opportunity. I'll sell shirts with words that people won't understand. I'll make clever little phrases. I’m the man.  So bottom line, I'm gonna play a bit. I don't know how long I'll be interested in this. I might lose interest in a week, or maybe five minutes after I post this. Nonetheless it is fun to think about doing stuff. Wooeee... Send me emails with design ideas - little logos you draw, pictures you want outlined or anything. I'll play with it, I'll ask artist people I know to play with them. Somehow, I will wear a shirt I made.  had some major age regression going on this weekend.

      Warning - Here follows a somewhat pageant post concerning my, at best, irrational emotions. If you can't handle it then sod off and read something else.   Would You Rather...   Overcome your worst fears  —OR—  Outsmart anyone who tries to screw you over?   Well I’m thinking of the things that I fear and none of them keep me from living a very full and complete life. So I’ll keep my hang ups and go for the “outsmart the a-hole that is trying to screw me”. I hate being played and when I get a chance to take down the jerk wad that is screwing me…HELL YES. You’re going down!  On a much lighter note: Would You Rather...  Be locked in a car trunk during a demolition derby  —OR—  handcuffed to a street light during a riot?   I'll take my chances on the street handcuffed to a light post. First off, handcuffs don't scare me! (no! really?) Secondly, I think people are good in general and I'm hoping for a nice person to come along and help protect me from the evil doers.  My mental state can only be described as capricious. Yet, all through the emotional rollercoaster-ride that is my life, one thing remains the same: I'm emotionally ambitious. Reaching for the stars is one thing, at least you know the stars are there, but what I do is that I reach for things I believe to be to be there, but may well turn out to be only fruits of an optimistic imagination. Try walking through a house blindfolded, and you know that somewhere around where you are there is a staircase. When you get to the stairway its all piece of cake, because you can feel your way up. But when you have no idea where the bloody thing is, its a tad more difficult. But you do know where it is, you can feel it, it must be. So you shift your weight forward and raise your right foot.   I am in the process of moving forward. I am dead scared there will be no staircase to support me, and I will tremble and fall to the floor, hitting my head on the hat-rack on my way down. All I can do is trust in what I know, that the stairs are right in front of me. Time will tell that I, once again, was right. It must be so. I think I'm going through a phase. One of these mythical periods of time us teenagers go trough from time to time, when we just can't be bothered to act like normal people and need something to blame it on. "I'm sorry, I'm going trough a phase", "It's not my fault, I was going trough a phase". In addition to out-of-this-world mood-swings, I'm finding it very hard to make myself do stuff that I should do, but don't want to. Under this category you will find things like; Homework, tidying up my room, calling relatives and thanking them for birthday-presents, giving people and libraries back stuff I've lent from them, preparing for tests (I've made a wreck out of two fairly simple tests within the last week).  So why should I bother? huh? Why should I spent hours and hours teaching myself stuff I'm utterly devoid of interest in when there does not seem to be any point in doing so? Until I (or anyone else) find a decent, believable answer to that, an answer that makes such sense I would have to go with it, I simply can not be bothered with this.  So I need therapy? Yeah, so do you.  [oh, glorious daytime—who would sacrifice you for a drunken night?] I identify seasons by their smell. It doesn't matter if it never snows once all winter long, I will know it is winter the moment I step into the crisp, cold air. My eyes can be fooled by the lack of white, and so can my touch. But even as the sun shines brilliantly somewhere far away, it can never filter through the cold to my nose. This supposedly unevolved organ remembers the way that cold feels inside.  But that's not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to tell you that it doesn't smell like winter today. I did not need to see the clear, clean melted snow puddles, nor did I need to hear that it was 40 degrees out. It smells like spring. And I'm breathing as deep as I ever have because nothing feels better than growth, than regeneration. Nothing smells better than potential. And I've been thinking the raising thermometer, no matter how long it decides to last this time, is as clear as any mirrored reflection of me. I am not afraid to be a fool for optimism. Every year I'm ready for this, whenever it comes, because I've always forgotten just how wonderful it is. Kind of like when I'm in some kind of pain and all I can do is waiting for it to pass. The moment that pain is gone—it's beyond amazing. You appreciate your healthy body so much more. And that is why I always say, RELIEF IS THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. Feel free to quote me because I'm right. Not love, not happiness, not success. Nothing can top the feeling of relief. And maybe on some level, love and happiness are tied directly to relief—like relief from being lonely. And that's what spring is. It's a relief from so many scarves and hats and clumsy jackets and ties that bind. It's a relief to see the sun up after 5:00 to feel the warmth in the air just a little closer to your skin, just a little closer to the earth. And beyond that, it's that freedom that invites kinetic energy... those swirling subatomic particles that let us know it's time to move it' time to set going this is your time this is the time to do what you always wanted to.  I never feel so powerful than when the first dripping icicle ruins my hair. I never feel so young than when I take off one more layer, and dance freely. I never feel so alive than when I can listen to the water moving again, after a long confinement. [carefree adventure with change lurking in the wings]  I have been neglectful, and I am sorry. I got a diary without a lock! And have been using it daily to jot down mundane details of each day, lists of what food I've eaten, general pontification. Kind of ridiculous, I know, but I received said diary as a gift from my aunt who threatened - "Now that I'm older I wish I had been writing down every detail of my youth, because my memory is failing and I can't recall." Scary. But I am aware of the power of !CYBERSPACE! as well, so... here I am. For you.  I just started my second semester and have had a brief glimpse of my free time as it whizzes past my ear, flushes down the drain, is forgotten and/or lost. I don't really mind though because I had three weeks of monotony and sleep, and I'm about ready to get back. My first class of the week is the Columbia Chronicle, which is a rather exciting atmosphere. I will be writing a piece a week. Kinda makes me wish I hadn't taken two other writing classes. Ah, well. This is what I do: I write. Being beyond the busy that I am currently will definitely be an interesting experience.  Now, on to our regularly scheduled programming...

      [pull up sock—one beat]  I'm not at all gloomy right now. I'm listening to the descendents, how could I be? This I assure you so that what comes next doesn't seem like mindless self-deprecation.  I am having a problem. It's called youth.   I'm very concious of the fact that I am a baby still, and I try to keep everything in perspective that way. But lately I've been feeling like maybe all of these actions which I attribute to youth aren't youth at all—maybe I'll be this way forever. I know it's youthful to assume that something will never go away, and I tell myself this. But it isn't that simple, of course.  I hate the feeling I get, that I get more and more, like "Shit, I've said to much again" and I have this nagging fear that this is the reason why no one thinks to strike up a conversation with me in classes or at shows or wherever. I'm just not mysterious enough, just too apparently young. Annoying.  And I tell myself that I'm getting better, that this is just another bout of melancholy, and I always bounce back from that, it just levels me out. But I'm afraid. I'm thinking maybe this behavior isn't just a phase. Maybe this is a personality I'm bound to for life, that will change only nominally as the years go by and experience punishes me. I'm afraid that I'm doomed to be a little too annoying, a little too excitable, a little too obvious, a little too honest forever. I'll never be able to drink with my family or go out with my friends without someone saying "Whoa, settle down." I'll always have to go up to people and interject myself into their conversations because, for one reason or another, they just don't think to approach me.   I'm willing to believe that my personal diagnosis is just as childish as my actions—that there is nothing more childish than saying "always", "forever" and "never."   But I guess that always goes away with age.  First of all, pick a letter, any letter  Got one? You should by now.  OK. For the following questions, all your answers must begin with the letter you just thought of. (Honor system here, my friends!) Have fun with it!   My letter is K  1. Name two types of food that you could care less if you ever ate again. Kumquat and Kamut  2. Name one animal. Kangaroo  3. List three words to describe yourself. Kind, kinky and kooky (Oh boi!  That was a hard one!)  4. Name two things you might find at a zoo. kangaroos, kumquats, kind people (I would hope!)  5. Name three things you might find living in the water. Give me a break! Kelp, ummm... Ken (Barbie's boi)?   Ohhhh!  NEWS FLASH   Oh wait...KEN AND BARBIE BROKE UP! Okay someone seriously hug me, console me, I don’t know what to do! Is there hope for any of us? Ugh...the hurt, the anguish! My life has been dealt a terrible trial!  OMG!  Why do atrocities such as this happen!  Apparently Barbie is jealous of Midge because she gets to be pregnant and Barbie in her forties may be going through menopause…  The horror and Ken will isn’t a sexual kitten anymore…  I am gonna cry now…  Where the hell is my blankie?        THE STAR MANGLED BANNER   There is such outrage when some idiot decides to burn the American flag. It's unpatriotic, in bad taste and no way to treat an innocent fabric. But there are other ways of slagging a country, whether intentional or otherwise. Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado pulled off what has to be the first doubleheader of national anthem desecration while singing (?) the anthems of their respective countries at three days ago’s NBA all-star game. Furtado started things off with a nasally-tinged version of O Canada that included an attempt at singing in French. Conan O'Brien is sure to be relieved after Furtado botched the Quebecois portion of the anthem. French Canada now has someone else to bitch about, as if O'Brien and Don Cherry weren't enough. Aguilera is another story altogether. Would these dumbass divas who are invited to sing The Star Spangled Banner just please sing the song the way it's supposed to be sung? Aguilera's bastardized version included an extreme amount of oversinging that would have made a Celine Dion rendition sound like a whisper.  For the record, it is "the land of the free, and the home of the brave." NOT "the land of the free - er - eee - ooohhhh - yeaaaahh - yesyesyesyesetcetcetcburp (pause) and the home (another pause) of the-ee-eee (pause yet again) braaaaaaaavvvvvvvveeeeee (hold last note for an eternity)." Who's to blame for bringing anthem mangling into the mainstream? It must have started somewhere. A classic anthem singer like Kate Smith must be rolling in her grave, if only to generate enough sound to block out the horrors of today's generation of singers. Maybe it's all Matt Groening's fault. I used to think the Simpsons episode where Bleeding Gums Murphy sings a twenty minute anthem was funny.  Now it's just prophetic.  More lists!  Read Each One Carefully and Think About It a Second or Two    1. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry.  2. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. (TIM) 3. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart.  4. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them. (To you know whom not Edwin) 5. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile. 6. To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.    7. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't willing to waste their time on you.  8. Maybe you need to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.  9. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened.  10. There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.  11. Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.  12. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.   SO I AM GOING TO BE STUCK IN HIGH SCHOOL UNTIL JUNE OF 2005, BUT I WILL GET  CNA LICENSE AND 5 AP COURSES AND MORE PRACTICAL LEARNING. SO NYC I WILL SEE YOU SOON BUT LIVE THERE A LITTLE LATER.  LIKE JULY AND I CAN WORK AND MAKE LIKE $10+ AN HOUR, SO I AM THINKING SCORE, WITH MY 6.5 EXTRA HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS!!

      My place of education is not a bastion of liberalism, by any means. To illustrate this, I will recount for you a moment from today's lunchroom that happened not 30 minutes ago.  We were watching the local news and a story about the gay marriages San Francisco is performing came on. We all watched it in silence, until a woman I have class with with said: "Last night we were watching the 11 o'clock news and they were talking about this when they showed couples, uh, kissing. Now, I know it was 11 at night and this is the news, but they don't need to be showing that. OK, I'm not saying you have to get turned on by the sight of same-sex kissing females (unless the members of the same sex happen to be Kate Beckingsale and Charlize Theron, in which case you are fucking REQUIRED to get turned on), but comments like this make me angry.  I mean I am gay!  How does she know I'm not? In fact, to make a point, as soon as she uttered that ridiculous sentence, I turned to the balding man sitting to my right and open-mouthed kissed him during the entire commercial break. (We have a date this Friday. Not really)  Does the fact that I did not actually do that make my argument less valid? Do I even have an argument? The answer is no. She just pissed me off a bit, and in the interest of keeping my cool, I chose the online route for venting, much to your chagrin? But now I found out the real reason...  I'm tired is because I'm overworked. Here's why: a. The population of this country is 273 million. b. 140 million are retired. c. That leaves 133 million to do the work. d. There are 85 million in school, which leaves 48 million to do the work. e. Of this there are 29 million employed by the federal government, leaving 19 million to do the work. f. 2.8 million are in the armed forces preoccupied with killing the Taliban. g. Which leaves 16.2 million to do the work. h. Take from the total the 14,800,000 people who work for state and city governments. i. And that leaves 1.4 million to do the work. j. At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals,  k. Leaving 1,212,000 to do the work. l. Now, there are 1,211,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two people to do the work. You and me. And there you are... Sitting on your ass, at your computer, reading jokes. Nice, real nice!! Now, I hate to ruin "numbers too good to be checked" with internet-verified facts (if it ain't on the internet, it ain't the truth!), but here's the real scoop, all documented with semi-reliable citations. And don't despair! The end result is even better than letting the original numbers go unchallenged.  a. The population of this country is 281 million. b. 40 million are retired and disabled, leaving 241 million to do the work. c. There are 72 million children, which leaves 169 million to do the work. d. There are 15 million in college, leaving 154 million to do the work. e. Of this there are 4.21 million employed by the federal government including military and post office employees, leaving 149.79 million to do the work. f. Take from the total the 18.6 million people who work for state and city governments, and that leaves 131.19 million to do the work. g. There are 2 million people in prisons. So relax, this still leaves 129.19 million diligent citizens, plus an increasing number of "undocumented workers," plus your Couch, to get everything done. Not only are you underworked -- you're totally superfluous! Take a break, for God's sake.   Interesting thoughts...  13. Never take life seriously. Nobody gets out alive anyway.  12. Life is sexually transmitted, don’t mean you need to reproduce.  11. Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can die.  10. Men have two emotions: hungry and horny. If you see him without an erection make him a sandwich!   9. Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to use the Internet and they won't bother you for weeks.  8. Some people are like Slinkies... not really good for anything but you still can't help but smile when you see one tumble down the stairs.  7. Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing.  6. Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.  5. All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.  4. Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred dollars and a substantial tax cut saves you thirty cents?  3. In the 60's people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.  2. Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that the resemblance is exactly the same as the first.  AND THE # 1 THOUGHT FOR THE DAY:  You read about all these Terrorists. Most of them came here legally, but they hung around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10-15 years. Now, compare that to Blockbuster; you are two days late with a video and those people are all over you. I think we should put Blockbuster in charge of immigration.

      When I got out of the shower this morning, as I was toweling off in front of my still half asleep cats, I made some sort of joke about being a nude, retarded, pervert. Livie laughed, probably more to avoid an argument about whether or not the nude, retarded pervert joke was actually funny than because it was actually funny, then said that as a child the word pervert had always confused me. All children seem to be a little mixed up over the words meaning. They are always saying things like, “Eww! Jimmy farted! He’s a PERVERT!” As an adult you know that in fact Jimmy is just a nasty little fucker and not really a pervert at all. Or at least, you know that if he is a pervert it has nothing to do with his nasty farting ass. Even though kids seem to be mixed up by the words meaning, they all seem to know it and use it. Where do they all learn it? We as adults don’t use that word much. We don’t go around saying, “Geeze, I don know if I want to invite Florian to the party. He’s kind of a pervert you know.”    THE DIFFERENCE:   There are so many differences between the citizens United States and the citizens of other countries around the world. Here is a short list of some that I think are particularly interesting. 1) People in other countries almost always have bigger noses, but their big noses look good and sexy on them. 2) The men of foreign lands all have huge rock-hard cocks. 3) People in other countries are not afraid of anything. Some examples of things that they are not afraid of include: Making a scene in a restaurant, death, fighting someone way way bigger and spitting on the floor. 4) The people of other lands always listen to shitier music, but have more fun listening to it. 5) Outside the US people are totally unembarrassed to show off their unusual talents. These talents might include: Making realistic animal sounds, singing some sort of rare type of song, doing some sort of rare dance or balancing things on their huge rock-hard cocks. Some Americans do fit these molds!  So I wonder should I have been a foreigner? And if not where are the Americans like this?  Still single but I am okay with it.  Not to say the American guys aren't still very hott, like Nathan or Jared... But more a statement of the thoughts that ramble.  nathan on the one side is a ver attractive man with his head on striaght and a future bright and rosy, I would seriously consider this boi, a desirable Ammerican, maybe to the extent of a foreigner.  And Edwin was unbelievably rude to me, but it is realy not a big deal.  Jared is like so amazing, he is a gaurdian of sorts.  So anyways to my rambling...       Have you experienced the “deep freeze” one too many times?    You know the feeling...you’re happily typing along when, all of a sudden, you just freeze solid.  As you wait (and wait) for someone with a heater to answer your distress call, you wonder just how much longer you can live. Maybe it’s time to take advantage of one of those great offers you’ve been seeing. “Dude, you gotta get a space-heater!” Or a blow drier, or some fucking matches, or something.  I think can help. My advice is to share your chocolate, love and flowers with those you love. I shared mine with Big Mama and Dad and I am as warm as a clam--happy too.  Music geeks aggravate me. If you ask me they're just about the lowest form of elitist asshole imaginable. I hate anyone who acts superior really, but the music geeks just hit something in me. the way a clerk at your local record pit will sigh and look down their nose at you because you're asking for what you want to hear, not the latest greatest electronic Christian rock piano cum polka band that's "exploding" all across the Netherlands. It just seems to me that they're over-compensating for something. maybe they feel insecure in their intelligence so they need to become unassailable by accumulating libraries of trivial and arcane facts about bands and songs no ones that only other music geeks know about, so anyone who doesn't immediately know what they're talking about obviously just doesn't "get it" well fuck that. Music to me is very simple, when I’m in an angry mood, I listen to angry music. When I’m feeling down, I listen to melancholy stuff. When I’m happy, I listen to happy music. I could-not-care-less about the "the industry" I don't give a fuck how much money x band is making when they should be making something else. I don't care about the ethics of record labels, or industry execs. You don't like me? Don’t sign the fucking contract. Put the music on the net. But I digress... i listen to what i want, because i want to listen to it. For instance I didn't stop listening to metallica because of napster... them being assholes and money-grubbing bastards; I stopped listening to them because their music turned to crap! It always changes over time (what I listen to) so I’ve never bothered compiling a favorites list. I spent a good 2 years listening to the grateful dead, Dylan and the like, but it just doesn't interest me anymore, so I don't listen to it anymore. These days I’m spending a lot of time listening to linking park. I don't care that they're typical of the music scene today (early 2004) I don't care that it's "angsty nu-metal" I don't care how much money they make, or if they even believe in what they say, I truly don't. The end product is all that's important. Vincent van Goh and Pablo Picasso were pretty fucked up guys... does that make their art any less important? Roman Polanski was awarded the Oscar of best director for The Pianist. While I personally think that movie was incredibly bland and wooden, vast amounts of people obviously didn't care that he couldn't be at the awards to accept... because he was in Europe fleeing charges of raping a 16 year old girl! And so I listen to Linkin Park. Whatever they may be "about" their music means something to me. it's so appropriate to what’s going on in my life right now it's scary, and it makes me feel I’m not the only one who's felt the pain I’m feeling. Any music geek worth his salt would scoff if I told him I liked Linkin Park. he would chuckle condescendingly at me at regurgitate whatever argument he's read in whatever trendy "underground" music magazine he reads, then shake his head at my naiveté. Fuck that. Hipsters are almost exactly the same. Most hipsters are music geeks and vice-versa. I’ve come to believe that hipsters are kind-of the new punk. Both are just laughable to me, punk and its new incarnation. Both groups (I will not acknowledge them as philosophies, they're just clubs) spout the same tripe; individualism, rage against the system, rebellion, tearing down caste systems, pseudo-intellectualism, beatnik living, and free-thought. The truth is both groups were and are more rigid, more doctrinaire and totalitarian then the systems they purport to hate. I’ve seen punks take 2 hours getting their hair just-so before heading out for a night of mischief. They all look the same, the all say the same things, they all listen to the same music, they all go to the same clubs, and they all think they "get it". Hipsters have the distinction of looking even more retarded then punks. the only nice thing I can think of saying is that for the most part these people grow up (if they don't burn out or get killed/thrown in jail) to be pretty decent people, usually very liberal and honest, but even then they still carry that elitist mentality, they just water it down to "oh they just don't know any better *sips current trendy wine*" instead of their previous "man the whole world is so STUPID! WE know what's going on here, we're so smart *heavy drag off joint/bottle/needle*" same goes for Goths, and probably a dozen other cliques I’m forgetting. Fucking sheep. My utopia is something like this: picture a nice pastoral setting, rolling hills, lush forests, like southern Europe... or the shire if that's easier. First of all there's no religion (I’ll get to religion in a big...), people are more enlightened then to believe in that shit. There’s tranquility, no ones rushing anywhere. There are no cars. People walk, or ride bikes, or horses. Long distance is achieved by bullet trains that go faster then the speed of sound. There is no monetary system, everyone simply get's what they need. Every house grows its own food, or picks it up from the market. People don't hoard things, there's no need, and again... people are simply more enlightened than that. Everyone does what they want. People that enjoy building build people that enjoy farming, farm (providing the excess to the markets) people that want to be doctors become doctors, and people that enjoy teaching become teachers, people that just enjoy lively debate and philosophy become philosophers. People do what they want because they want to do it, not because they they're driven by a social impetus to hoard baubles. Children are allowed to grow, and experiment, and do as they please, because in this world, it's accepted that when they're ready they will "grow up" people are kind to each other, and everyone is equal; gay straight, black white, man woman. What I’m describing is not an Amish or Quaker type thing, because high-technology abounds. There is an internet, but it's only used for what its intended purpose was: spreading ideas, keeping in touch with friends and family, sharing media (artistic, not pr0n) and learning. I won't say robots because that implies they're self-aware, and in this age of enlightenment it's accepted on the grounds of sheer common sense that true AI must never happen, it simply has no useful application outside of areas of war, and in this world of course... there is no conflict. But serving machines will be commonplace when people go out to eat (at a restaurant built by a person who enjoys building, operated by people who enjoy cooking) their food will arrive at their table via serving robots. Robots will also be responsible for all manufacturing needs, because I don't think there's anyone who enjoys factory and assembly line work. There is no societal craving for betterbetterbetterfasterfasterfaster technology. When systems reach adequate levels no improvements are needed, so none are researched. If a stereo plays your music, why must it be "improved"? If computer and microprocessor technologies are strong enough to satisfy all computing needs why must they go ever faster and faster? Of course there will be improvements, they will simply stop when there's clearly no need for anything better. If a computer game has perfectly photorealistic graphics, and runs so well no one even thinks about frame rates or choppiness, what need for improvement? Instead improvements will come in the form of CONTENT. everyone will have all the tools they need to create things they want to create, artists will get physical art supplies, and art programs, etc. this is not to say that there will just be an incredible abundance of any kind of goods anyone could possibly want, what I’m saying is, there will be no DESIRE to accumulate more then you will use. In this world psychology is king, and the human brain is understood. Communal gatherings will be commonplace, and happen frequently. People will enjoy attending and look forward to these events, because in this world, there are no chronic shut-in's. Sure there are people who are perfectly normal and well-adjusted who just enjoy staying inside and reading a book as opposed to outdoor activities, but they won't be crotchety types. Anti-social hermits almost without fail, generally avoid contact with others because they hate the ignorance and intolerance of the masses... but those ignorant masses do not exist here, so there's no one to avoid. Unions between two people in this world are gentle affairs. Local customs would of course dictate certain small details, but in general if two people decided to commit to a monogamous relationship, they would tell each other quietly, by themselves in a secluded natural spot. The words would be heartfelt. And when the couple returned home they would have a party to celebrate their joy with friends and loved ones. There are no STD's in this world, and sex is almost a non-issue. People have it, or don't have it as they wish, it's a natural thing and no one thinks twice about it.

        Ladies and gentlemen, we may experience some turbulence...   Right. Just to warn you, this will be a fairly whingy and self-indulgent therapy-blog. Those of a sensitive disposition are advised to look away now. Dad’s fluey thing turned into a full-blown gastrointestinal episode on Monday night (or rather, the early hours of Tuesday morning) with Thai food as the cause. He hasn’t really eaten or slept properly in about a week now. Her is working a lot I feel bad and I’M REALLY SORRY that I haven’t been a very attentive nurse and he’s just been struggling on and now he does from home. I have a snot-headed cold which isn’t miserable but irritating and much worse at night, Just tossing and turning all night and waking each other up every half hour and my meds aren’t working, I guess I am to sich for them. And I have to get up at half past five. And I’M FUCKING EXHAUSTED. I can’t be bothered to do any chores around the house; I’m just sitting in bed surrounded by clothes and art and poetry stuff and random shit and getting more and more worked up. Dad and Big Mama will be up  in an hour and I’ll be in a right state by then.  And I’ll probably shout at them and they’ll think I’m being ungrateful because they cleaned the bathroom and it’s spotless. Sob!  PS I know these aren’t real problems and that there are starving children in the world, but I just feel better writing it down. Sorry, I know it’s not very entertaining. PPS A happy note to end on: I brought the toaster down and I am thrilled to be able to make toast at the touch of a button again. It’s great! Might make some now...    I've Heard It's Better On Ecstasy - Candy is addictive, right?   That's because drug overlords are actually the presidents of the confection companies, and so this would act as free and necessary advertising, since drugs are going downward in popularity and usage. Plus, it hooks the kids and virgins of ecstasy. It would be perfect. Just a few suggestions. I don't think that ANY Candy Corp. CEO would be able to turn these down. If they do, then I'll give them a candy heart that says "We're breaking up." Then they'll give me one that says "Please don't, I'll do anything you want." And then they'll be like putty in my hands...ironic that I'll be playing with their hearts on Valentine's Day.   Alas the 13th curse strikes!   My multifarious thoughts and feelings, without regard to logical argument or narrative sequence...  Damn thyne mind for a wicked web it shall weave!  Just started this book and already I'm wondering the validity of the statements made. How can a thought or idea have its own agenda using our brains to spread and stay alive? The author even proposes the idea that we may not be the free thinkers we thought we were, that idea is only a "meme", as he would call it, that has spread itself across the our brains and stored itself in books for so long that we think we have free will. If this is the case then where does an original meme come from? Does it just manifest itself out of nothing? If new memes really can manifest from nothing than how do they? A proof of this new theory could be detrimental to our society in ways we cannot know, since proof would mean we can't think for ourselves. It's good to see friends I don't see very often...er, non-roommate friends. Going to Coffee Brew Place on Sunday was a very welcome change of scenery today. Big Mama had a cold coffee and I sipped Italian soda through a straw that was obviously too long for the cup. I'm lazy though and couldn't get another straw. Talking about everything from Orthodoxy to church planting to enigmatic friendships is always the best when intermittently interrupted by the exaggeratedly loud voice of a dirty old man. It was nice to get a new perspective on things, though...and I suppose to give one.   POEMS  A desire for something so great A fulfillment that will never be reached A love so pure, yet envisions such hatred Hidden by such depth As if encased in stone A whirlwind of emotions That dare not be revealed Searching for a purpose Which could never be found Once such a success, now is drenched in failure With the utmost courage he ponders her life He hides away wondering Where’s his purpose, his meaning,  His pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? Why is everything so lost, everything so confused? Pondering his life with such risk He envisions to be perfect But fails to be anything close He strives to be the best But gives up ever so effortlessly  Well, the whole thing with Edwin is over, he is in love with his ex and I mean all is fine.  I know that Edwin will be happy with him and I will search my search anew.  So bois, I am available! I think Edwin will be happy with him, it may take breaking another boi's heart to get it though...  I really do hope that he is careful... Edwin don't get yourself hurt by him, don't for I know what it feels like, take care of yourself Edwin we are always good friends.  Cries that no one hears Tears that pierce the skin Thoughts so cold, warmth is no where Wishes of nonexistence Fears, hopes, and dreams No one knows of Screams on the inside Cries on the outside A wish that could be so easily fulfilled But fear consumes these wishes Drowned with sympathy Such terrible empathy is never felt Screams indulged in silver Released in such hatred and despise Everything's fixed the same way No matter how hard he tries  He needs this to survive He pretends everything’s okay But he's such a horrible actor he deserves no Oscar For he’s failed once again And maybe this time he'll fade away Fade away into nothing  No I am not depressed I am merely musing At this point I feel compelled to haul myself out of slothful self-indulgence and shower. I'm going to get clean, shaven and straightened before I force myself out into the snow to bank and buy then eventually return to the mountains of work that have managed to grow and multiply in my two days of lethargy. Now, To the water-closet!     Last night and the smell of too much orange juice linger in my mind. I was punch drunk and ate Mom's fruit loops. I feel bad, and have to go buy her a big new box today from the grocery store. Shameful, especially considering his much need camaraderie and commiseration offered without second thought last night. I purchased the aforementioned juice and My dad matched me nearly to the drink with his sadly mandarin favoured vodka and orange soda-tinged abominations. Ironically, the milk I poured over the sweet stolen cereal didn't suit me either. It's been, apparently, too long without dairy for me. I haven't been able to stomach the cost, and now I can't stomach the lactose. Poetic justice for my sin, I suppose. Roiling belly and rancid farts continued into the night.  The commiseration continued. We talked on subjects which became more varied and tangential as my state of intoxication blossomed. We talked about Edwin. "What a bitch," he said. I laughed and was glad, but sad for I don’t hate him we will always be friends.  Most interestingly though were our discussions about writing; my work, my plans and then his own (of which I have read nothing and knew less). Apparently Edwin's may need to search for some inspiration that might start him on the university path again. Proudly I declare that my description and discussion may help.  To Edwin and all of you listen to this : I know he has something worthwhile to share there. I told him that there's nothing wrong with having pride in your own potential -- that I do myself.  It's always comforting talking to my dad. He's a great human being, but besides, he and I can connect on virtually any subject. There's no apology (or need to give one) on those few topics where our interest or understanding don't coincide. Basically he's a good guy that I can always get along with easily.  Bonus: some of the things we discussed were amazingly interesting. Borderline inspiring. We agreed that he's better suited to write the story "Edwin" than I am because of his distance and perspective. I think that with many further discussions (though he understands her more intuitively than anyone else I know) he could do the idea justice. We made some unbelievable... breakthroughs regarding the nature of imagination and its connection to god, the unified field theory, calculus and the constant. God, it turns out, is the sum of the set of all prophets. And I don't even think I was drinking! =)  As it was, I'm glad that I didn't spend the whole night bitching about things, wait I did.  It's time to really get on with my life and future.

      Maybe there is something to the whole friday the 13th thing...  Well, sometimes it doesn't take much to make me feel like a complete moron. Ok, so today as mother drives driving to school, I think, hey wait, do I have my wallet? So while I search my pockets with the other. No wallet.  My stepmother looking all over neglecting the road.  Hm... luckily I had no dire need for it, and I am already going to be late for class. Then, when I get to school, I grab my school bag, gym bag, and lunch of the back seat, and head off towards the school, and as I head to English class, I notice I feel somewhat... lighter than usual. Something was missing... I check my pockets (again) and not only was I missing my wallet, but my keys also. Yes, I locked my keys in the my mother's car. When I checked after classes, there they were, on the passenger seat, seeming to mock me, and my absent mindedness. So with no wallet, and no keys, I spent most of my day thus far trying to figure out how But anyway, after a few tense hours, and a lot of frustration, and feeling rather dumb, everything worked out ok. Nothing injured except my pride.  If I had an office the sign on the door would say 'my door is always open unless it's closed'. I'm in the mood to watch a video called 'rare trampoline accidents' that would amuse me right now. Everywhere there is sperm but we can not see it. It would be good if somehow we were able to see all the sperm and feces that is everywhere. On the subway pole the dying sperms from some man who had just tossed off in the peep show. And you're standing by the pole with one hand on it while you eat a bag of chips. Once while I was in the hallway I looked down and on the cuff of my pants there was what looked like a giant wad of jizz. It kind of freaked me out. What if some man was standing near me while waiting for the subway and was tossing off under his jacket. Or maybe it was just snot.    So I have some conclusions:  Everytime a dog licks his paw a kid in Nebraska starts barking. Make me believe in skepticism. Lie down vertically is fun. Stand down in the night not the day. Give advice about advice. On which day did god create days, the last thing he said was 'don’t touch that' There are revolving doors of misperception.   And I really love this dating thing, I mean Edwin is sweet as to boot and sexy as hell and he really does know what he wants. I truly believe that we are great together, and I have two full days with him.    For a long time, feminists have been reputed to hate sex. What does their sexuality have to do with it? Is there any validity, or was there ever any validity, in the assertion that feminists are opposed to pleasure or the human form? I ask this because of the infighting and mixed up ideals emerging from the mouths of self-proclaimed feminists. It is confusing to read a denouncement of Hooters or Playboy as being sexist enterprises when I, a feminist, do not find myself agreeing with that statement. Do you frequent strip clubs? Spill it ... how does your feminism influence or limit your sexuality?  I am going to be fairly unoriginal, and comment on Valentine's Day, since the day of love is almost upon us. I have mixed feelings on the subject for a few reasons. For most of my life, I was single on Valentine's Day. Actually, four years was the first time I was with someone on Valentine's Day and only that one time. So, I generally had feelings of resentment towards it. However, this being my first Valentine's Day with  urlLink Edwin , I have had a change of heart (no pun intended). While I do agree that every day is a good day to say "I love you" to that special someone (and I do make sure to repeatedly let my special someone know I love him) but it is kinda nice to have a special day, to go over and above, and make a big deal of these things. But at the same time, since I spent so many Feb. 14ths single, I have sympathy for my single friends out there. I hate being a sort of "dating elitist." But I seem to do so from time to time. I don't think singleness is a bad thing. In fact, I enjoyed mine, but there comes a time, when most people come to a point where they want to share something special another. But should we couples be encouraged to flaunt our romance around others who may be lonely, and wanting to find someone? This is quite the sticky situation. Do we risk offending others or do we risk offending our significant other (and all us know how our boifriends/girlfriends will never let us forget neglecting our valentine's duties)?  But, not for I, I think that my boi  urlLink Edwin , whom is amazing can get me nothing and the shear joy of seeing him on Saturday is enough for me. Seems like some stuck between a rock and a hard place. The second problem is with the obvious commercialism of Valentine's Day. With the cost of flowers, cards, candy, gifts, etc. that we are "told" we should buy, the middle of Feb. can be an financially bleak time, especially for us students, who are still recovering from tuition payments and textbooks from January. Is it wrong to give in to the capitalist seduction of Hallmark? Should we boycott this money-grubbing, and greedy facet of our society, and eliminate Valentine's Day for the sake of our wallets? Part of me says "YES, YES!" But part of me says "shower him with gifts." I mean, he deserves it, so I suspend my objections to our consumerist society for a day? Does this make me a hypocrite? Ohhh, so many questions! My solution has been thus far a middle-ground. Do something simple. A little gift, spend time together, and stay away from Hallmark stores, with those adorable little bears, balloons, cards, etc. that whisper, "buy me! He'll love me. It will make him happier." and so on.  Buy away for even if I shan’t be showered it doesn’t matter.   I would rather the time and the message and the relationship flourish and bloom, even if the flowers are in the store wilting.

      Plans are advancing nicely! I get my boi. *squeals*  Dude like wow! I am sooooooo frickin' happy     Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage." -- you know who Actually, I happen to believe that our nation doesn't have any business defending the sanctity of anything except the freedom of religion itself. In other words, the government should get out of marriage altogether. If marriage is such an important part of religion to conservative Christians, then the government has no business regulating it in any way - neither forbidding nor allowing. Earthly law should be toothless in marriage and marriage should be toothless in Earthly law. So this is how we protect Bush's and others' vision of a sacred institution not to be trifled with: Confine it only to church. Allow the churches to marry whoever they want, and refuse anyone they don't. Allow the churches to make divorce impossible - because as everyone else has said ad nauseum, Britney Spears is doing more to ruin the sanctity of marriage than any gay man ever dreamed of. Meanwhile, we'll be over here doing the civil union thing.  Don't get me wrong, I think most churches, if not all, would require that there be a civil union to go along with the marriage, but if the synonymity of the two is actually causing our government to wring their hands about possibly going to the time and expense of passing a constitutional amendment   Remove marriage from civil unions, and the right-wingers can't complain about the sanctity of marriage. Remove civil unions from marriage, and the left-wingers can't complain about discrimination. God, jus' be nice to the gay men!    More Self Help Bullshit  I have now been asked to write down four things that motivate me by the previously mentioned work colleague... And by work I mean eductation 1.	My beloved - because everything I do I do for him, and without whom life would be meaningless. 2. Friends & Family - I don't want to let people down. 3. The Past - I have done things in the past that I am not proud of, and don't wish to make the same mistakes again. 4. Self Improvement - I want to get better at the things I do, and want to keep getting better.  Said colleague was confused that none of my driving forces were money. He could not understand why I was not driven by money. My reasons for this are quite simple really - money controls us and defines who we are. I dislike that.  When I do something I want it to be for the right reasons. I am not a materialistic person. I want experiences and things from life, which require money to achieve, but money is just a means to an end for me. Money is not the meaning of life, and never should be.  What amazes me are the lengths that coffee drinkers go to for coffee ... so I'm an avid coffee drinker ... when I need coffee, it doesnt matter if its the shittiest coffee I've ever had ... one time, when I was at a basketball game, someone offered to buy me coffee ... so I said yes ... he came back with black coffee - no cream or sugar ... I asked him where the cream and sugar were and he said they're at the stand ... rather than walking my ass up I decided to drink the black coffee ... I finished it instantly ... it was the most bitter coffee I've ever had ... yet I drank on ... funny how I drank the coffee even though I didnt like it ... or maybe ... whats even funnier is the fact that I couldn't get up and walk a measly 50 feet to get cream and sugar ... hmmm ... a thought for the day...

      Mrhahahahahah!  I am so frickin' happy I mean .com happy, I have been grining all day long, I mean striaght cheezing! A smile like the photgrapher desire typoe smile. So, I have a Valentine's this year!  And I swear Edwin boi.  You rock my socks!  Dude I am sooo excited about this weekend!  I get some time with my boi... So yeah here he is  urlLink Edwin   I look forward to everyone listening to my tales of grandeur, my crusading by ranting. I also will indulge you all with stories of good haircuts, like the one I get tomorrow, both past and present. Mind you, some people might find what I say vulgar or offensive, but seriously, if that. I will say what I want, simply because I feel it needs to be said. I'm not going to be a complete dink or anything. I'm just saying, if I drop the f-bomb, or say something like gays should vote, well its my right, and you can go to hell for trying to stop me.   Hell, even if do say something incredibly stupid like "We should ship all the people with AID's onto an island, torture them, and finally put them to death after murdering their family" and someone starts bitching at me, well hell, I'll just put together a study, crunch the numbers, and prove why that is the best solution even when I don't agree. But I won’t maybe I will…  Is there a funnier word than flaccid?  Seriously, I don't think I could name one. You say the word and the absolute only thought it brings up is a limp noodle, so to speak. Even though it technically means lacking firmness, resilience, muscle tone, vigor or energy, no person ever talks about how their arms are flaccid. I invite you to try it on your friends though. Just mention how flaccid they look. Especially while showering together after a good workout. Feel free to mention how you wouldn't mind working out with him a few times a week to get some firmness in there.   Do you see? Even though what I just said wasn't that funny, because I kept throwing around "flaccid" and using it's inherent connection to penis jokes (which are incredibly funny in their own right) it became funny enough to stand on its own.   And just so you know, I am not here to be a comedian, so if that wasn't funny enough for you, go to hell. I am just trying to explain why this word is so damn amusing. Throw the word flaccid in the middle of any conversation, and suddenly any topic is interesting. Start telling Jim in marketing about how flaccid his work is. Tell him Jill on the third floor can help liven it up. Watch the sexual harassment hilarity ensue.   Hell, I am pretty sure its going to be part of skater lingo pretty soon if it isn't already. People just going on about how flaccid that move was. Of course, once flaccid starts moving away from the general consciousness as no longer just a word that describes the state of a penis, it will lose its funny, and we are stuck with just another word like "wiener" or "manipulatingunderagedgirlstohavesexwithyou" which have been played out to the point where they are meaningless.   So in closing, while my jokes may have been flaccid, the word itself is anything but. Try it out yourself today. I bet you bring out a smile in every persons inner child, or at least it will be awkward enough that they will have to smile and pretend they aren't extremely annoyed by your idiotic lack of tact.

       Great! Then a glarious day has been had, and all the masked man demasked and all the world is zealous minus me.   Just I don't know maybe I need things that I shouldn't have i.e. razor blades and bois and poison.  Well bois can be poison all of relationships minus two were. And other one: I have just realized that everything in this state hates me from the State Senator to a god damn stapler!  I've had dreams lately....  ...odd, peculiar dreams. Noteable, to the point where I made certain to write them down in order to share. They've been GLORIOUSLY detailed. Vivid...sprawling dreams. So many that in actuality there are too many to tell. But one night in particular was incredible. Although I am departing from my normal journal entries....I will share one more dream.  It began with mist. I could sense it all around me, a thick harbor mist tainted with salt and deep ocean. It was brushing my face, and I opened my eyes when I felt the ground beneath me moving in a slow rolling motion. I glanced down, and realized I was not standing, but in fact sprawled wide leg upon something. Almost as if riding a horse, but my legs were spread far too wide for a horse. Within the dream, my vision panned back...and I realized I was straddling a mammoth elephant. Not just a 'big' elephant, we're talking the size of a ship. HUGE. Moving slowly, although I knew it wasn't really moving slowly, it was just it's size making it seem so. I heard waves then, mixed in with the heavy draughts of breath from the elephant. I looked to my right, and without being startled...I discovered that the elephant and myself were actually standing smack dab in the middle of a huge shipping lane, with ocean vessels moving past us, out in the fog. There we were, in the midst of all these cargo ships.... and it wasn't startling at all. In fact, it made so much sense. My elephant was big enough that his legs were plunged far into the sea to the sandy floor, and he was going to carry me across the water along with all these ocean liners. I spotted then that behind the huge blankets of his ears, were two stairways running down along the back of his jaw; my escape route. I didn't take it however, and knew I was safe with my elephant. My dream shifted then, and I was suddenly standing on a boardwalk by the seaside. It was very dark out, almost impossible to see...until I noticed that there was daylight off some hundreds of yards out in the water, in a strange arc. I was in a cave! A cave, with a small township within it, and I was standing by the water's edge looking towards the mouth of the cave. There was a wooden dock that went out into the water, but unlike most that jut into the sea upon pilings high enough that the tide does not sweep one off one's feet....this one was resting right on the water, like a dock on a lake might. My husband was with me, and wanted to take a picture of me. I was a bit reluctant...as he wanted me to walk out onto the dock, and I had noticed some high waves coming in through the mouth of the cave, into the dark water (it seemed as dark as night, in that cave) - but I went anyway. I walked across the damp dock boards, turned...and peered back at the shoreline where he had the camera ready. It was then I heard a rushing sound, and sure enough...just after the picture snapped a huge wave came up out of the inky deep and swept me off the dock. I plunged into the water that was neither warm nor cold...and fully expected to go swirling to the bottom. But, the wave lifted me up much like a surfer...and I found myself riding the crest of it all the way back to shore where I was unceremoniously spit out onto the sand. I wasn't scared, just a bit put off that my clothes were wet...and after plucking the remnants of seaweed off my jeans, I started walking towards the lights of the little town nestled against the back of the massive cave. The dream did not end there... but the depth of detail was captured most in those first two 'episodes'. And now that I've shared... we can continue on with our normally scheduled programming. . .  And another poem:  Unanswered Prayer  Prodigy of the masses, don't hold yourself too high. It's the longest fall from way up there and the blow will make you cry. When the impact breaks your bones... you'll let out a moan and wish to die.  You're a charming, gentle Jesus... you heal the sick and lame. But why is it that underneath I hardly feel you came? This heavy heart that's reaching out, feel's nothing cured and does without, always feeling pain the same.  You're everyone else's savior but my own. You make everything better to those you hardly know. For the one who always prays you're the one who never shows. Granting everyone else's needs... I'll be the one that you let bleed, from the open wound that grows.  I built you a temple and you don't see all the effort put into it; how it came to be. The stones covered in my blood... ...my body drenched within the mud and I'm still paying back a building fee... for an empty prayer that's done nothing for me.

       Just i don't know maybe I need things that I shouldn't have i.e. razor blades and bois and poison.  Well bois can be poison all of relationships minus two were.  I've had dreams lately....   ...odd, peculiar dreams. Noteable, to the point where I made certain to write them down in order to share. They've been GLORIOUSLY detailed. Vivid...sprawling dreams. So many that in actuality there are too many to tell. But one night in particular was incredible. Although I am departing from my normal journal entries....I will share one more dream.   It began with mist. I could sense it all around me, a thick harbor mist tainted with salt and deep ocean. It was brushing my face, and I opened my eyes when I felt the ground beneath me moving in a slow rolling motion. I glanced down, and realized I was not standing, but in fact sprawled wide leg upon something. Almost as if riding a horse, but my legs were spread far too wide for a horse. Within the dream, my vision panned back...and I realized I was straddling a mammoth elephant. Not just a 'big' elephant, we're talking the size of a ship. HUGE. Moving slowly, although I knew it wasn't really moving slowly, it was just it's size making it seem so. I heard waves then, mixed in with the heavy draughts of breath from the elephant. I looked to my right, and without being startled...I discovered that the elephant and myself were actually standing smack dab in the middle of a huge shipping lane, with ocean vessels moving past us, out in the fog. There we were, in the midst of all these cargo ships.... and it wasn't startling at all. In fact, it made so much sense. My elephant was big enough that his legs were plunged far into the sea to the sandy floor, and he was going to carry me across the water along with all these ocean liners. I spotted then that behind the huge blankets of his ears, were two stairways running down along the back of his jaw; my escape route. I didn't take it however, and knew I was safe with my elephant.    My dream shifted then, and I was suddenly standing on a boardwalk by the seaside. It was very dark out, almost impossible to see...until I noticed that there was daylight off some hundreds of yards out in the water, in a strange arc. I was in a cave! A cave, with a small township within it, and I was standing by the water's edge looking towards the mouth of the cave. There was a wooden dock that went out into the water, but unlike most that jut into the sea upon pilings high enough that the tide does not sweep one off one's feet....this one was resting right on the water, like a dock on a lake might. My husband was with me, and wanted to take a picture of me.

      Two months ago I noticed that every two months near the end of those months, I get this feeling of sadness hovering over me. It's something that's there but as easy as it comes it'll go away too. It had for 3 consecutive bi-months already. So here it is again. But while am at that period, things just feel so heavy. Although not yet as bad as the past two times that I noticed it happening but it's just the first day.  It got me to thinking though, 1) has this been happening before just did not realize it and 2) did I jump into the 'Decision" because of this? Said 'Decision' also happened at the end of the month six months ago. Sleep these last several calendar entries has been fitful, my energy during the daylight hours has at times been lower than normal. This morning, I had to drag myself out of a seductively warm bed to prepare for someone stopping by at the god awful hour of 8:30. I somehow managed a fair imitation of consciousness, produced decent enough English to get myself through the interchange. After they'd gone I grabbed my gym bag, guided my half-comatose body out the door. Brisk air, morning light swelling in the eastern sky, small car filled with quiet people (apart from noises listed in the first paragraph above.  My Evil Plan (tm)! Your objective is simple: Widespread Misery. Your motive is a little bit more complex: Sadistic pleasure  Stage One To begin your plan, you must first traumatize a wealthy heiress. This will cause the world to sense a grave disturbance in the force, paralyzed by your arrival. Who is this nightmare beyond comprehension? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good as an intelligence transferred into a computer?   Stage Two Next, you must desecrate the Internet. This will all be done from a floating fortress, a mysterious place of unrivaled dark glory. Upon seeing this, the world will die in a way you just don't want to think about, as countless hordes of computer programmers hasten to do your every bidding.   Stage Three Finally, you must send forth your plague of doom, bringing about nightmares for every man, woman and child. Your name shall become synonymous with sheer dementedness, and no man will ever again dare take your lunch money. Everyone will bow before your mind-boggling insanity, and the world will have no choice but to worship the ground you walk on.   Mrrrhahahahahahahahahahaha!   Witch (Ode to the Bitch)  I will not forget  all the pain that I met within you words and eyes. The things you imply... make me confused. I'm not amused  and for once what I want...   Is to fall into this black hole and forget you and stamp out everything that gets in my way. So that it won't exsist... a place this pain won't be missed  and where I won't have to love again...  ...because love is trouble... and love says, "I'm a bitch."  And love hates...well...at least me. And the world warned me she was a witch.  No...but I did not listen... no...I didn't care... that what I was giving and getting  was no longer fair.  But it doesn't matter, at least not for today. Cause I'm going to discard her... I'm going to throw her away...  Just like she did to me. I'm going to forget love Eventually... Apathy...come set me free.  I'm gone now...you can't have me back. Fool me twice and shame on me. Well...you fooled me thrice... you misery.  Down with my love... forever more... It's about time that I killed  these injuries...

      My Unease About Reality: What Do I Do About It? What is this unease I feel about this reality, this existence? What is the source? There's this anxiety, this fear, about being here. I think this fear is really my fear of what I could do to destroy what is here if I got angry enough. I’ve had experiences in the past when my rage grew pretty quickly, but I was able to recognize that and prevent myself from acting it out physically on something or someone (well, at least for the brief stint when I was a kid during which I just wanted to beat the shit out of my brother in any given moment, it seemed). I think there's this pent up anger that's been gurgling beneath the surface for most of my life. When I was younger there were many times that I was emotionally hurt by how others treated me, but I never revealed that to anyone. It seems that my hurt turned into anger at some point because it was pent up for so long. Perhaps a more accurate way to describe it is that what felt uncomfortable may have accumulated to a point when, as a matter of survival, it had to come out in some way, and that way is described as rage, an uncontrollable explosion of energy, as if my body was like a spring and just before it reached its load capacity due to the things placed upon it (uncomfortable feelings), instead of failing, it saved itself by forcing off the load in one explosive uncoiling. I think as a result of this pent-up-ness, there is also the quick-strike reaction towards anyone that I think is trying to control me. I suppose that because deep down I feel suppressed already because of the load of past uncomfortable feelings, that I am pretty quick to interpret another's actions as controlling, and if they are in fact controlling, to exaggerate them, or at least react to them in an exaggerated way. It seems my own morality (which I really believe I was born with) has worked against me. In other words, I have this sense that people should be friendly and kind to each other. So when I feel that I am upset at someone because they treated me in an unkind or unfriendly manner, I keep that to myself because I feel it would be unkind or unfriendly to expose my uncomfortable feelings to them. I assumed, I suppose, that what I felt would somehow rub off on them. or, and perhaps a more likely scenario, I felt that I would be ridiculed for how I felt and didn't want to feel even more hurt because of that ridiculing. I suppose the basis for my uneasiness towards living (which, interestingly enough, doesn't happen when I dream... curious that is... except that lately, since just before the Iraq war, I’ve had dreams that the war would come here and everything as we know it would be destroyed, and those experiences created real intense feelings of fear and sorrow while I was still dreaming, which is very rare since almost always my dreams don't have any emotional content whatsoever)... As I was saying, I suppose the basis for my uneasiness towards living is that I have this fear of being myself fully because I feel that part of myself can really destroy someone or something and I have somehow linked that up with doing just about anything because I don't want to react in an uncomfortable way towards whatever anyone or anything might do and thereby adding more uncomfortable feelings on top of what's already there beneath the surface. I sense that there also is the deep sense of sorrow that we all can't be another way, that hurt really has to be a part of all this. I’ve tried to rationalize it away with different theories, such as, reality is what it is, and it's only my story about it that makes it hurt. And perhaps that's right.  Perhaps I carry a lingering hurt that my parents didn't stay together, that I didn't get to know my father when I was a kid or all the abuse I was subjected to. Perhaps that's really the sorrow I feel.  Yet, as I got to know more about him as I grew up, I realized that there was much I didn't really prefer to be around.  So perhaps it's really the missed opportunity of getting to be around him as I grew up and well the abuse is it just that abuse; however that may have turned out.  And yet, as I’ve recently read in astrology writings, the "missed" opportunity may have created a new opportunity for me to learn to be self-reliant, which really has seemed to be an important need of mine throughout my life. But I’m not sure that that's what I really wanted. It's true, I shun away from relying on others, but perhaps that's really because I don't want to experience their nonacceptance of me because I think it will really hurt me. And if I really think about it, I really do rely on quite a few people to get what I need or want in my life.  I suppose that a truer statement would be that I shun away from other people for emotional support. As I’ve reflected on my life the last 5 years or so, it seems that I react to life's situations based on the feeling I feel as I react to them. So to me it has seemed that I do everything based solely on a comfort-discomfort scale, because everything that I can attribute as being the initiator of my actions, including those sparks of intuition, creates a feeling within me. I suppose what would be beneficial would be to not move through life according to what I feel, in other words, to not use what I feel as my compass in life.  So naturally the question becomes, what compass, if any, do I use?  Perhaps the answer is another question: why do I even need a compass, why follow anything? Of course I wonder if that's really even possible.  Perhaps it really boils down to looking at what really is going on here in this reality, what exactly is my experience of it, that is, what really is that experience as an entity in itself?  Of course I wonder if even that is really possible. But perhaps the reward is in just the trying of such a thing. But that will have to wait till another day.

      "I am not a man, instead I am a scared terrifed boi afraid of what I am and who I will turn up to be.  I am the one who will hide and I will be the one to die without tears, for I am that boi."  Words spoken at alow that seem fitting for the feeling of depression lurks on all shadows  What Can Be Of The Most Use To Myself/Others? What can be of the most use to myself and others? Why do I even have the need or desire to focus on such a thing? What can be of the most use? What the hell does that mean?  Use = benefit. Okay... what can be of the most benefit to myself and others?  What I really want to say is... what can be the most benefit to others and how can I provide that? Why? Why is that so important to me? What do I care how others' lives can improve because of something I do? Where does this urge come from? Or is it that I really just want to care for myself?  Do the turnarounds: "What can be the most benefit to myself and how can I provide that to myself?" Is that more accurate? Let me sit with that  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  (still sitting)  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........  ..........   Intellectually, as I review my life, it seems my life has been a mixed bag of doing things for myself and doing things for others. but there is an uncomfortable emotional charge that comes to the forefront as I reflect on my relationship with others, myself and with life/reality itself, and it seems that this is mostly due to the fact that many, many times I felt that I was giving more than I really wanted to give or not giving when I really wanted to give, and sometimes not receiving as much as I wanted to receive. So with respect to the question above, "what can be the most benefit to myself and how can I provide that to myself?” I can see how that is really relevant. in fact, I would say that the most dominant source of discomfort for me has occurred when I haven't let myself be me, and almost always that was due to fear of what would happen if I did. So I had this double whammy sensation going on inside me: the discomfort caused by fear itself, and the discomfort of restricting something inside me that wants to come out, something that really felt good at its core.  What I had was tenseness on top of tenseness. Not a great experience. Let's do another turnaround: "What can be the most benefit to myself and how can others provide that to me?" Does that ring true? Seems like it does, and pretty loudly at that. Many times I’ve looked to others for appreciation, comfort, etc. and to be honest, I felt the discomfort the moment I acted on the impulse. What I felt was the sensation of emptiness, a hollowness or pulling away from the center of my chest because I thought that I didn't have something that I was supposed to have, or at least desired to have.  There was also the sensation of being at someone else's mercy that sense of hopelessness and helplessness because I believed that someone else controlled my life.  What naturally followed was the tentativeness in my behavior, the "walking on egg shells", in an attempt to "do the right thing" in others' eyes so that they would give me that appreciation, comfort, or whatever it was that I was seeking from them.

      Ooooh today was slow, and really mundane. I woke up around 5:30 am (after about 4 1/2 hours of sleep; I couldn't stop thinking about my toenails being ripped off, or, should I ever become a mortician, a corpse suddenly opening it's eyes and staring at you---all accusinglike, like "HEY! You're cutting slits in my jugular arteries, bleeding me dry, and pumping me full of nasty chemicals! STOP THAT!"), or those ever so wonderful thoughts of there is something that is under the bed I know it.  I can see the dead white hands, why should I step onto the floor?  All to the pleasant sound of my plundered Cinderella alarm clock. I was completely ready by 6:15 which meant I had an hour to sit around the house and watch scantily clad parents get themselves up.  PATRIOTS! Overall it was an incredibly exciting game. So close though and I think the Panthers played really really well. I'm pretty sure they'll be back. The stupid halftime show sucked and those 2 attention whores really need that publicity huh? "Wardrobe malfunction" my ass.  What is up with all these commercials with clowns (it’s a phobia dude) in it? I fuckin’ saw 4 of them today and I wanted to break the TV! Im gonna have to stop watching anything if they keep it up. Clowns are EVIL!!  Like “IT” I cry at that movie.  TIME... An age old concept, right? You hear scientists talk about it. But do you? Do you ever wonder about what it really is? Do you ever wonder about what it means to your everyday life? Just what is it really? Is it just a concept? Why does it even exist? For what possible reason could it serve? Without it, it seems there could be a lot stress, right? I'm sure there's a million other little questions like these that you could come up with, and of course just as many answers (if you really wanted to come with them). But let's try to start as basic as we can, much simpler than any little trite phrase or description you might have heard about it. Let's try to be original in our little investigation here and not use what others have said about this thing called "time". While I'm here on this little topic of "originality", let me say a few words. To me, this little... Boy, I sure do like that word "little"! There seems to be a reason for it (at least at this point of my writing), and that is that I'm just poking a little (oops... couldn't help it, it just snuck in) fun at the topic of conversation while also emphasizing that it really isn't such a little topic. And speaking of "little", I hate using caps. They seem kind of meaningless, unless I’m trying to emphasize my point. Cap'ing requires that I type extra keys, so not doing so saves a little on the fingers. So from now on you won't see them in the "proper" way or maybe they will it depends on the time. Also, in case you're interested, I don't like to put the periods or commas inside quotations. That too seems a little meaningless. The item inside the quotes includes only that item and not the period or comma. So why include them? Whoever came up with that idea???!!!! Anyway, back to our investigation... the little investigation, that is. Originality, to me, represents whatever is true for me or you, no matter what anyone else says. Of course, that seems obvious. But do you ever notice when you're not "original"? Never mind that, even though that's an issue very much worth pursuing. Perhaps a more important question is, can you ever be truly "original"?  All these letters I’m using here to create all these words are all borrowed. I was taught these. What about the ideas and questions that I/we are playing around with here? Are they, could they ever be, "original"?  Of course we've come across ideas that we've read or heard somewhere and we ourselves had had those ideas come to us at an earlier time and at that time we thought or felt that it was the first time we ever experienced that idea. That idea was "original", wasn't it? Maybe a little more easy to recall are the feelings we've had. Anger... fear... joy... can anyone honestly say that such feelings are original? Of course there's always the argument that no one can really ever know what another is feeling, so one really can never know whether or not such feelings are "original". This argument falls along the same lines as that of the color one sees. Do we all really "see" the same color red, or green, or purple? And you can say the same about anything each of us experiences, such as "love", for example. Of course, to really be able to follow through with this little investigation, we must look at how we "know" things. If I say, "I know how you feel", what am I really saying? What do I really mean? What can you honestly say about such a situation as far as your experience is concerned if you were the one who made that statement? Don't we simply attach our own feelings the person's behavior we are observing? Of course there are those who are absolutely certain that they can feel what others feel, and I’m not denying that they do. After all, how would I know that that is not true?  And this is really my point. Can we ever really know what is true? Unfortunately, got to run now I will write more later, much more later...........

      So I never made resolutions and I know that I am well-over-do for them but I started writing out things I really want to do in the coming year,will post them here. My top ten things to do in the new year    10 Eat more broccoli, hey prevent premature aging. 9  To be more accepting and kind to people I dislike. 8  Eat at regular times. 7  To have better skin. 6  To be a more conscientious student. 5  To floss more 4  To work on my body 3  To trust more  2  Milk a cow 1  To write more      "So why, now, when I hear GWB's speeches, do I think of Hitler? Why have I drawn a parallel between the Nazis and the present administration? Just one small reason -the phrase 'Never forget'. Never let this happen again. It is better to question our government - because it really can happen here - than to ignore the possibility. "   It is interesting to say that it is immoral to kill for the sake of food. This concept even seems foreign to me. I am curious why it might be considered immoral to kill for food. True, humans are omnivorous and could get along fine without meat, but that doesn't make it immoral to eat the flesh of an animal. Considering the laws of the jungle it only seems appropriate to kill for food. Take the bear for example (also omnivorous); there are many different types of food on a bear's pallet from berries to fish. And the polar bear, which relies mostly on meat, will eat anything from baby seals to baby walrus. That is simply the way this planet operates. And people, being inhabitants of this planet fall under these same guidelines for survival. The ecology of this planet relies on its inhabitants' killing to "prune" for new growth.  This is not to say that the animal diet of humans is not unbalanced and perhaps even gluttonous, but to say that it is immoral to kill an animal for its meat seems to me to be ridiculous. As the most intelligent species on this planet some might say that it is our responsibility to rise beyond the seemingly barbaric law of the wild. I think the being the most intelligent species merely means we are responsible for maintaining this planet for all its inhabitants, and eating meat does not even enter that picture.  Upon comparing the slaughter of thousands or even millions of animals to the slaughter that took place during the Holocaust is not possible for two reasons. 1)The Holocaust was man turning on its own species in murder and genocide and very rarely in nature is cannibalism witnessed, which brings me to number 2)The death of the millions of Jews and gypsies was not because Nazi Germany thought they might taste good with potatoes and wine. To kill for food is not murder, no matter how you look at it.   So is it immoral to kill another animal for food because it causes that animal pain? I think that all depends on a person's own feelings about animals. It is observed in nature that the superior animals or predators kill without thought of how much pain is administered. When a lion sinks its claws into the antelope's rear legs to immobilize it the pain felt by the antelope must be excruciating, but a lion does this not to cause pain to the animal but because it is the most efficient way of ensuring it and its young a meal. Likewise. when a cow dies for human consumption it is done in a very humane manner and the animal feels very little pain if any. So why then is it immoral to commit this act? Although it is arguable whether or not causing pain in this way is even immoral.  Let's look for a moment at the hypothetical situation of a "trans-human" species coming to Earth for a new and different food (human flesh). This is not something humans should accept, but if humans should die for this new species' meal is it wrong? I personally don't see how it could be considered immoral. As long the Earth's ecosystem is not collapsed by this new presence what wrong is being committed? The lives of the humans would certainly change from management of a planet to simple survival making us the same as the wild animals that inhabit the planet. Here is the harsh truth: if the aliens were to take my mother away for their next barbecue there would still be no wrong committed. I would hate the aliens for taking my mother from my family and I would want very much to retaliate, but that does not change the morality of the acts being committed.   Really, I cannot say whether I am right or wrong in saying these things; only that upon observations of this planet and its inhabitants I cannot agree with the idea that killing another animal for food is wrong based on the fact that it causes that animal pain. Pain is a natural part of this world and should be accepted as such. Life, pain and death are all inevitable in this world and the natural way of things.

      As I lay here in the dark, quiet, stillness of the morning. I attempt to look outside and see that the windows are completely frosted over.....and I quietly think to myself....."I have to walk and drive in this weather....I think not" Then I calmly role back over....bury my head in the pillow and wish it was saturday.  But alas I am being beckoned by the siren call of the evil alarm clock.....in a feeble attempt to disable the beast I pound mightely on the snooze bar...it drives the beast away for a time..but it returns with a vengence. I pound mercilessly on it agian....and yet it returns to taunt me. I in somewhat desperate straights actually look for the incredibly small of switch, the only breach in this evil beasts armor, I am successful...the hellion has been neutralized....just as I am about to role back over and claim victory...it occurs to me that the first class I would be missing is creastive writing taught by Sister Luke-murder-me-in-my-sleep-if-I-miss-class.   oh well.....time to get up I feel compelled to write. The problem is that I am not really sure what to write about. I have doubts about whether there is anyone even reading my blog... let alone that is of any use to anyone. But it does give a forum in which to spout my vast quantities of wisdom. (that would be sarcasm boys and girls...or as Will will know call it "the tearing of flesh").  Something that I have been thinking about recently.... I really need to connect more with my friends.  I see the evidence and fruit of the long-term friendships around me and realize that I have never had that. I really long for that type of friendship... and yet it is very difficult for me to open up or find people to open up to. Because of the life I have led before I find I still hold people at arms length... I tend to be too judgmental of people that frustrate me... even though the people that frustrate me the most are the ones I have the most in common with. There are times when even when I am with my “friends” I still feel like an outsider looking in, like I really don't belong there...like I am just tolerated because "They have to be nice to you". This causes me to push people away. The thing is… I know this is wrong... I know I have people in my life I can trust. Why are the lies so easy to believe sometimes? Well I have probably been to open about things here but... I don't know maybe there are some of you out there that have the same feelings... if you do...you are not alone. Someone has just very kindly got me a coffee from the vending machine. I then, (as I always do) transferred the coffee from the crap plastic cup into my mug. I took a sip. I turned green. My mouth was filled with the grimmest taste, like how I'd expect pure mould to taste, slightly bitter with a vomity undertone. It was clinging to my teeth and I could feel it's thick pungency overloading my tongue.  Because I'd just eaten an apple I wondered whether the sweetness was affecting my taste buds. You know, like the natural sugar and fruitiness wasn't lending itself to the fine Brazilian blend. So I asked two other people to taste the coffee, they both agreed to its mingingness. Just before I phoned reception to let them know that the vending machine was buggered I went to pour the coffee away. I then realized that when I had transferred the coffee between mugs I had done so without looking. I then remembered the wild mushroom soup I'd had mid-morning. I then remembered that I hadn't finished it. If anyone ever, ever, ever tries to make you drink espresso mixed with mushroom soup. Hit them. In the face. Very hard. Twice.  So here I sit with a bottle of Excedrin, a glass of water, Pepto-Bismol, and a pack of cigarettes. My head feels like there are gnomes inside it with pickaxes. My breath could burst into flames at any second...I'm almost scared to smoke. To top all this off, I've gotta go to school and my stomach is doing back flips.  Nah. Simple fact is, even with the list of phone numbers I've accrued and the beds I have waiting in a few seperate states and counties, I'd rather have have love. I'm sorry it didn't work out nothing does for me.  So, love is something I will try but I will do it differently.

      "It has commenced...new classes are upon us in full force, seizing what sanity we have left after a menacing term. The thought of a pure, utopian society has faded while MHS has captured the last breath of any rational existence and conquered our self-worth. In coming days it is likely to see a plethora of unpleasant faces staring into an oblivion that can only be experienced by the MHS society. The underlying prolificacy in which this institution so loves to put forth has taken a toll on our already feeble carcasses, in result of consuming repulsive cafeteria rations. The possibility of survival is a distant notion...God help us all..." It seems like everywhere I go I’m REALLY cold. It would be so nice to lie with someone in a really comfy bed under the blankets and just lie there, and be really warm. I’m not saying that in a sexual way because I’m "horny," I’m saying that in a completely innocent love kinda way. (Believe it!) ah, that would be so nice :) MER!  You can take all this bullshit and stick it where the Sun don’t shine. I'm a little sick of hearing all this shit about my work and my ethics when God only knows how many times I've had to take control because you were too fucking stupid to handle a line. I work my ass off for you and this goddamn place, and all I get in return is another set of duties and a transfer ripped away because you, sir, can't deal with what you are! Do you fucking know what I've given up for you?  Sorry, had to get that out after the past couple days. I seriously have decided to quit, though. Not my job. I'm not decided on that. I've decided to really quit caring. It came over me this morning when I was lying in bed staring at the pictures hanging on my wall. What's the point of caring anymore? Honestly, it seems that every time I give a shit, I end up getting stuck in this little hole where I can't move, breathe or think straight. So, I went backwards a bit. Lemme explain… I am a cold bastard. It wasn't because of anything more than I'd been hurt, and I didn't want to be hurt again, cause my ways of dealing with pain normally end up with me destroying myself. I wasn't happier. I was downright miserable. But not letting people get close insured that people couldn't hurt me. I've been hurt a lot in my life. I'm a little sick of it. How can I avoid it from now on? Easy. I'm going to be that shithead again. The one who really just doesn't like people? I can laugh, I can talk, and I can have a good time, but I can't care about people anymore. I know how it ends. I'm sick of running that gauntlet every time someone comes into my life. I'm not going to try to shut anyone out. There's no point behind it, cause I can't. But I was looking in the mirror this morning and I realized that Will was right. I'm not me anymore. I've shut down and gone dead.  I used to say I wouldn't let this thing with John change me, cause I'd rather believe in love and give it away to the people I care about. I still believe in love. I don't believe in people anymore. We're too flawed to ever truly care about people. I think all my past shows I need me time.  I am jus’ annoyed give me a couple days. But to you bye!  He put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette. He broke his heart: He spent his whole life trying to forget. We watched him drink his pain away, a little at a time, But he never could get drunk enough to get him off his mind, Until the night: He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength he had to get up off his knees. We found him with his face down in the pillow, With a note that said: "I'll love him till I die." And when we buried him beneath the willow, The angels sang a whiskey lullabye. The room was full but nobody knew how much he blamed herself. 			        For years and years, he tried to hide the whiskey on his breath. He finally drank her pain away, a little at a time, But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind. Until the night: She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger. And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger, Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. We found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life. We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullabye.

      So I got to see Tad hamilton with Tim, it was really good I hated Tad "If you don't go after it with all you've got, it's just like letting life slap you in the face."  "When a REAL love isn't returned, part of a man dies inside and will be gone forever." I wanted to mention a few things I like about movies...  I especially like how necklaces are snapped off of a person’s neck with the greatest of ease, often to be reattached later as if the  chain magically is not broken in half.  I enjoy fight scenes in which people get hit in the face with metal objects but continue fighting like they just got slapped by a small girl.  I love when hilarity ensues because the main character doesnt have enough balls to say "I broke it, sorry I'll buy you a new one"  When every person in the movie seems to be really good at  Kung-Fu...love that.  I love watching such realistic scenes like the motorcycle driving at high speed on top of a train going at top speed in Torque. Actually the whole trailer for Torque has ridiculously improbable scenarios with people speeding on a motorcycle and flipping around fighting...its retarded.  I actually just got done watching Underworld. It was entertaining. Its the battle between vampires and werewolfs thats been raging for thousands of years. It just reminded me of a Matrix meets  Tomb Raider type of thing. Is it too much to ask that some things be realistic. I know were suspending reality in watching a movie  like this, but if the characters fight with regular guns, then dammit I want automatic weapons shot from 15 feet away of a group of  people to hit someone. At least in the Matrix the characters were known to be able to play with gravity and such. I understand fight scenes look cool, but I'm sure it could look cool, but be somewhat plausible at the same time...thats all I ask...Thanks.

      The world is our oyster. it's just a matter of how long we take to savour it.  Slave descendants filed another billion dollar reparations suit recently. Every one wants to line up to get some free money from corporate America. All of these should be thrown out. There is not a good reason why anyone living today should be held responsible for a horrible period in history. African scholars and politicians today must be honest and admit that the enslavement and sale of Africans from the seventeenth century onwards was done by the Africans themselves, especially the coastal kings and their elders, and that very few Europeans actually ever marched inland and captured slaves themselves. Where do the people of European extraction go to get their reparations? Europeans were enslaved on a regular basis in the 10th and 11th centuries. I would imagine that you will find white slaves in Africa at some point in time. Should we then be able to sue Black Americans for their ancestors involvement in that? Let us stop this shit now!!  Some quotes from break: "Dan you can stop staring now" --me "She's a severe hottie" --Dan out of character and in a daze "I just want some ribs" --me "You guys are always talking about serious ideas, and then one of you will say something like 'then the pope was like, "what's the dealy yo, yo"'" --Me "You don't need to sit back there, sit up at one of these nice tables" --a security guard at the public library to me "You fell in love with that boi, you freak" –Dan to me concerning the 76 "Cope" –Sam to me while throwing a pack of cigarettes "That's the best fire pit I ever dug in fifteen minutes in the dark" --me "We're at Lowe's buying charcoal, lighter fluid, and an axe, this is awesome" --me "Hahahahahahahahaha" the four of us (family) during The Butterfly Effect, while everyone else in the theater was not laughing "Dude, they had double deuces of old English for 59 cents" --um, me I guess "Cigs 9.99 per carton" --a billboard "Your back porch smells like pall malls and malt liquor this morning" --Maybe me again, yes me "I just worked my ass off fo dem folks, and they only give me a dollar" --IHOP waitress to me (she was a psycho) "Got tin milagrams o' moephine n some good hash from flowda" --a drug dealer  It is so terribly nice out today that I am almost giddy. It made me wonder about the extent that the external influences my emotions. I have always put so much stake by my emotions (whether I wanted to or not) that I began to worry about there value, if they were just the results of things like weather. I worried for about it for ten seconds, or so, (probably because it was so nice out that I couldn’t worry about anything….not even that Greek test tomorrow) and I realized that it doesn’t matter if my emotions are influenced by or even the effects of my surroundings and my experiences….if they weren’t I would probably be institutionalized.

      Picture Haiku *coughs* ...And I'm Caught ...and i'm caught thinking of my Beloved, caught by camera, licking  I've been sheltered by a lonely dream.  There's a stranger here  Looking back above the bathroom sink  Every night I throw you out  Leave you stranded on the boulevard  You know that I use you up  I used you like I used a mop  Well the band's singing hallelujah  Hallelujah, Hallelujah  You're all gone. Yeah, you're all gone.  If I could have a simple love  How would it feel and what would it mean?  I'd only trade you away  For Mary Magdalene  Oh, it wouldn't make me insane And it would make me the king  And I wouldn't have to wait  Wait around for the real thing    My head full of things today, like the need to build a foundation inside so that I always know who I am. If I have unending love for myself, I'm a rock. I'll get there, I'll learn to forgive myself.  I'm grateful to have my blue rose, and all of my other great friends whom life wouldn’t be just that life without as partners in crime, to check up on each other and make sure we're taking time to be w/ ourselves and not be afraid to listen to what's deep in our hearts. As I write this, it seems new-agey, and it bugs me. Is it the cynical, hard, Virginia bitch in me? The part that never wants to admit that there's an issue? I've gotta let go of that. Listen, here is the huge discovery I've made. I think I finally found my angel Fabi, the one I've looked for my entire life. But there's a twist I never expected. Despite the fact that he exists, It doesn't mean that we are meant to be together. In fact, I realize that what he has, what I've wanted, is what I must develop in myself, and I think I have much of it already. For years I thought I was looking for someone else but I was looking for me. This realization overwhelms me right now, but it's liberating as only a true catharsis can be. I feel a lot of fear and a lot of love. I found a new world in my heart, ha! Amor y lucha, amory y lucha, porque in la lucha, hay vida.  BABY, YOU AND I will find each other and eachother together!  I heart you my beautiful baby boi!  Lata’ moi Chica  Most folks experience a lot of difficult shit but shine so hard. Nevertheless. But then...don't know why I'm thinking about this on a beautiful day, about friends who f'ed themself up on purpose? ...If I was the husband of an acrobat would I look like the living dead. Boy? You're on the wire and can't get back, let's talk about the living dead. Could have had a car, could have had it all, could have walked in the sky but we stare at the wall. I know where the money's gone, I know what you do. ‘Cause I've seen the hole in your arm, and the needle's a much better screw. But oh, what will you do alone? ‘Cause I have to go! Sometimes I still feel guilty for walking away, but I know I tried my best and if I'd stayed, I would've gotten dragged down too.

      [w]ri[t]ers on the storm- 5 Minutes on Getting it All Figured Out I honestly do believe that some folk wake up on his or her 8th birthday and stare at the ceiling and say, Holy shit, I totally want to be a banker, or a school teacher, or a stock broker. Or, a fireman. Unfortunately I believe that overwhelming majority of people grew up in houses where parents did something shitty, see part time retail, or something really boring, see account executive or CPA. Before we truly understand the value of money, despite what anyone says a person does not learn the value of money until he or she pays his or her own bills, we cannot associate "what do we want to be when we grow up" with a lucrative title. So what happens to us? We wake up one day when we're 18, when we're 22, when we're 38, when we're 64 and we realize that STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WE WANT TO DO WITH OUR LIVES. I'm trying to decide what's worse for me right now. Coming to grips with the fact that I may not have the smarts, money, family, ambition, work ethic to achieve my dreams or if I never really had a dream to begin with. Tomorrow will I wake up as a failure or just another tax payer who likes to treat himself to hot wings once in a while? That'll give you some insomnia.  This is a week of lists... (Bare with me) Ten Must-See Drug Movies  1. Trainspotting. Sick, funny, morbidly fascinating. Who could have guessed that Ewan McGregor would become a heartthrob? 2. Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Hands down, the absolute funniest movie I have ever seen. And true. Sure, it is. 3. The Basketball Diaries. Harrowing autobiographical tale of a descent into depravity. Leonardo DiCaprio is riveting. 4. Less Than Zero. One of Robert Downey Jr.'s best performances ever. Too bad it was prophetic. 5. Blow. OK, I haven't seen it yet. But it's a true story, it sounds good, and I adore the guy who plays Tuna in it. 6. Homegrown. Jon Bon Jovi, Ryan Philippe and weed. You'll love it. 7. Up In Smoke. Cheech and Chong at their funniest, driving a van built of pot. We watch this about once a week. 8. Bongwater. I put this on here as a joke. There's no way I could watch a movie with Jack Black, Andy Dick and Jamie Kennedy in it. 9. Valley Of The Dolls. Drug abuse, circa 1967. Sharon Tate's only starring role, just two years before her murder by Charles Manson. 10. Reefer Madness. Made in 1938, this movie used to be required viewing in schools. Did you know marijuana use leads to insanity?!?! Best watched stoned.

      Apparently there will be a weekly conflict on my site about sexuality, well then bring it on bitch!  It is obvious that this is my God-damn, fucking, bloody site and if you don't like the shit that I present, then pretend it is television and change the fucking channel.  Where else are they hearing this?  Hmmm?  It is obvious that the pussy-fuckers don't have any balls and if they do I am sure they are shrucken and look like raisens because I am damn sure that the only action they have seen are from thier own hands.  It seems some gay-bashing-mentally-rejected-asinine-foolish-dumb-shits-destined-for-the-nine-to-five-job-of-flipping-burgers-at-McDonalds-asshole-cuntbags are activiely presuing a fight with me.  A little word of advise carpet-munchers this is America sweetie, freedom of speech and freedom of press gotta love 'em!  Another small thingie you Neo-hilter wanna-be rejects, in the words of Courtney Love "Fuck Off"!  Random musings, part 2 Ahh... Monday, Monday. Can't trust that day. Since my head's always still foggy on Mondays, let's start off the week with something simple: random crap. Reincarnation: What would you want to come back as in your next life?  Models: Do you respect aspiring models? Shouldn't models feel guilty because their looks had something to do with getting their jobs? (kidding). But seriously, knowing that you're getting a gig based solely on looks - can that really be satisfying? Why is modeling considered a 'profession'? Honestly, I think that's bullshit, but I love Megan, my girl, call me! Beats: Multiple genres of music, or mainly one? First Dates: Ladies, what basic things things do you come to expect on a first date for it to be considered a success? Guys, your perspective? If there's an awkward silence from a lull in the conversation, do you point it out or do you ignore it?  Voltron: Does anyone know why there were two Voltrons? There was one comprised of lions and another made out of automobiles and planes. I'm sure this confused kids 'round the world. The confusion is like to that which I felt prior to learning that Michelle Tanner was played by the Olsen twins. Before this discovery, I thought that Mary-Kate-Ashley Olsen was just one of those really long honky names (i.e. Billy-Bob Thornton, Peggy-Sue Johnson, Betty-Really Humpter). SNL: Will Ferrell or Chris Farley? What would you rather be: A quadriplegic but mentally sound, or mentally retarded but had full use of all your limbs? (don't forget to factor in the ability to masturbate when deciding). Spring: Where the fuck are you, Spring? Winter's acting like the dependent fat girlfriend and overstaying her welcome, again. That bitch.  Dawn of the Dead Review  So in order to swear for a more benign reason, I'll review this steaming pile of this frappucino looking runny human excrement.  First of all, let me clarify a few things. The original Dawn Of The Dead is my absolute favourite zombie movie of all time. Sure some of the special effects and makeup are outdated (ok, they all are) and the soundtrack is filled with a weird pop synth vibe that is often cornier than scary, but it has truly stood the test of time. It still resonates as one of the more socially significant horror movies. It broke the mould blending gore with moral and political commentary. But more importantly it was and is fucking scary. I watched it again on DVD last week and there were 3 or 4 good jump moments, as well as a palpable sense of fear throughout. And keep in mind, I've seen this movie before, several times! But enough about that, I promised a review of some brown substance. So this one opens off well enough, sure the opening isn't NEARLY as scary as the original and offers very little insight into the state of the world, but it does a good job of throwing you right into the mess of a world gone crazy. Sarah Polley (way to go Indie Movie Queen, congratulations on SELLING OUT. Just because the movie was filmed in Canada doesn't mean the $25 Million Dollar Budget qualifies as a small production, which you've always said you will only take part in) is a nurse, her husband and her are attacked by a zombie child and Sarah needs to escape to survive. I'm gonna stop there and tackle my biggest problem with the movie. No spoilers here, promise. Well as you've seen from the commercials, the zombie's are fucking fast! Just like in 28 Days Later, these aren't really traditional zombie's they're more like me after doing a hit of speed. Wait, I don't do speed. They're more like Barry Bonds before a big game. Y'know, what with the steroids and all. Anyhoo, my big problem is that fast zombie's just aren't all that scary. Its more like a mob of people rushing after the characters in the movie. So what does that mean? Its an ACTION movie, not a horror movie. Put aside the communicable nature of zombification and you have an overblown action movie with a bunch of guns, explosions (wait until you see the nuclear-like explosion of a single propane tank), sex, etc. So, mob of people, action movie, that means suspense is up next right? WRONG. There was only one scene (a childbirth scene) that actually held any suspense, mostly cause you were paying attention to all the brains being splattered all over the place instead of the horror of the world that these people were living in. The whole fun of a zombie movie (as opposed to an action movie) is yelling at the characters: "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? DON'T JUST STAND THERE WHILE THAT ZOMBIE LUMBERS SLOWLY TOWARDS YOU!!! FUCKING DO SOMETHING!!! SHOOT THAT FUCKING ZOMBIE IN HIS FUCKING ZOMBIFIED HEAD!! DON'T BE FOOLED CAUSE HE LOOKS LIKE YOUR OLD DANCE COACH, HE'S GONNA FUCK EAT YOUR BRAINS AND THEN DISEMBOWEL YOU!!! SERIOUSLY!! WHY AREN'T YOU FUCKING RUNNING OR AT LEAST WALKING AWAY GINGERLY!?!?!?". Without this gut reaction, you might as well just stop making zombie movies. Yes it takes place entirely in a mall. In fact, in a small twist of fate, the mall that they used to film this movie is the mall across the street from the house I grew up in. I probably spent 15 hours a week in that mall growing up, reading comics, playing video games, mugging old ladies, etc. So that part was cool, cause like, y'know it was filmed in the mall I grew up in. Ok, I got nothing. It wasn't all that cool in the end, cause the mall is scheduled for demolition and they didn't use any of the actual stores (not that they are actually still there, hence the demolition). Back to the "yes it takes place.." thing. So the mall is supposed to mean something, but here in this flick its just a place that happens to have locked doors. Sure there's the amusement of watching the guy across the street from a giant mall picking off zombie's from the roof of his gun shop (correct me of I'm wrong American readers, but you don't actually have gun shos on the far edge of a suburbian mall parking lot do you?), but bye bye messages about consumerism and capitalism. Hello jokes about HDTV. Bleh. Fuck off. So all in all, this movie fucking sucked. It was the worst fucking horror remake I've ever seen. And I've seen them ALL. This movie made me want to run outside and chew on peoples shoulders just to see if I could turn them into more entertaining zombie's than the ones in the movie. Oh yah, and for a movie about Zombie's, we saw a grand total of TWO FUCKING PEOPLE lose flesh to zombie's. Not a single disembowlment. I think there was a decapitation, but I've already forgotten. I'd watch it again with a scorecard but I'm afraid that I'd have to fucking disembowel myself after sitting through it again. I hate you hollywood. Way to ruin the legacy of my favourite goddamned voodoo inspired satan worshiping zombie movie. Burn in hell. I'm coming to eat your children.  No mention of Riley sorry!  You all know how much I heart that nigga'.  I will rub it in some more lata'.  *sighs*  FIVE WEEKS UNTIL PROM!  I am excited!

      Will wins!  Just finished marathon game of Dogopoly with my charge, who was supposed to help me clean my house. We did this instead, which was much more fun. I've never won at Monopoly before, so I take the Chicken-shit route of playing against a three year-old. And I kicked her ASS! Ended up owning everything but three "properties" (in this case, dog breeds) and cashed out at $9,426. She had about $30 left. And yes, I am gloating. In front of my charge. I wanted to show her what the real world is like.  Just finished watching a classic Simpsons episode, where Homer has only one day left to live. He spends his last day listening to Lisa play the sax, records a video for Maggie, goes fishing and plays catch with his father, has a final drink with his friends at Moe's, and is intimate with Marge. [Among the other things Homer wanted to do but didn't have time to were: Tell off his boss, go hangliding, and plant a tree.]   After Marge falls asleep, Homer sneaks downstairs and falls asleep while listening to the Bible on tape, as read by Larry King, in front of a window looking out into the night. When morning comes, Marge realizes Homer's drool is still warm and implores him to wake up. When Homer realizes he's alive, he vows from that day forward he'll live his life to the fullest.   The very next day, Homer is seen sitting on the couch eating Pork Rinds Light while watching bowling on TV.   If I had one day left to live, here's how I think I'd spend it: 1. Watch the sun rise over the desert valley with Riley. 2. Have a talk with my best friends, Thomas, Megan, Sam, Riley, Damien, and Jared over breakfast about how proud I am of them and that I'll be watching over them, always. 3. Go skydiving and hangliding 4. Have lunch with my closest friends at the top of a mountain and thank them for the gift of friendship, all the fond memories created over the years, and for accepting me despite my shortcomings. I'd let them know how proud I was of them and perhaps leave them with a reminder that they have the opportunity to truly make the most of the time they have left to do everything it is they ever dreamed of. I'd reassure them to not be afraid to fail. Then I'd sneak off alone to admire the nature. I'd try to calm my fears by soaking in the serenity emanating from the trees, the animals, the sun, and the crisp mountain air while being humbled at the realization of my small place in this world. 5. I'd hit up a bling-bling boutique and max out my credit card to buy my stepmom an extravagant dress. She's a thrifty shopper and would feel guilty if she ever bought anything too lavish, since she's always been the family budgeteer. I remember her having to go to her nephew's wedding in Hawaii a few years back and feeling ashamed that she didn't have anything to wear. She hadn't bought a dress in over twenty years. Everything  formal in her closet was from the eighties. I swore that the first thing I'd buy her, once I had enough money, was a beautiful dress. One that she could be proud to wear. 6. Sit my father down and talk to him. Truly talk to him about everything (which would require me to duct tape his mouth). All my adventures; all my dreams. I'd leave no stone unturned. I'd let him know that I understood why he was never around when we were growing up, although at the time I hated him for it. I never had a father to throw a baseball around with, to talk with about bois, learn how to shave or how to properly tie a tie, and all those other coming-of-age things you're supposed to learn from a father. But what I did have was a father who loved me very much. I guess deep down inside I've always known that. And that was better than a person to play catch with. I would  tell him that I loved him. And that I would always be proud to call him my old man. 7. I'd watch the sunset beyond the Pacific Ocean from The Cliffs in San Diego. Then make my peace and myself. 8. I'd have dinner with my family at home, all of them just like any other night, except on this night we'd turn off the TV and we'd truly listen to one another.  9. Make time to listen to a few of my favourite songs one last time: Four to the Floor- Starsailer, So Disco- Sensuous, It’s Written in the Stars- Paul Weller, My Beautiful Friend- Charlatans, Ay Ay- Two Face, and for my baby Riley, well really most are for him, The Life of Riley- The Lightening Seeds    10. And, if I were lucky enough, I'd spend my last precious hours on this earth with the one I loved and bang him like there's no tomorrow (which there wouldn't be) then simply watch each other and drift off to sleep cradling him. *My last request would be to have my body cremated and have my ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean. Most of these aren't anything too elaborate. But I think they're simple things that would make me happy as I finish out my time here.  [w]ri[t]ers on the storm- A lil’ bit of Will’s mind breaking off, watch out when falling for 50 stories it might hurt a tid bit!  Ummm, yeah! The backdrop: A rainy day. Mix in some light snow and a little scotch and you have a Tuesday afternoon in New York City. The mood changes as Jim Croce somberly spews forth a hint of melancholy into his small, but cozy studio. Thoughts of Manhattan are reduced to clam chowder and bustling subway stations. His attention is caught by a face that seems vaguely familiar. His gaze had very likely been inquisitive and tactless; for he became suddenly conscious that the stranger was returning it, and indeed so directly, with such hostility, such plain intent to force the withdrawal of the other's eyes, that he felt an unpleasant twinge and turned away from the mirror.  What was it that was stirring inside him, causing him to lose precious hours of sleep? Perhaps what he felt was no more than a longing to travel; yet coming upon him with such suddenness and passion as to resemble a seizure, almost a hallucination. This yearning for new and distant scenes, this craving for freedom, release, forgetfulness - they were, he admitted to himself, an impulse towards flight, flight from the spot which was the daily theatre of a rigid, cold, and dispassionate toil.

      Telemarketers are a pain in the ass, I think we're probably all in agreement here. But people who solicit door-to-door are full blown hemmorhoids. DING-DONG!!! Argh!! Nothing says (insert expletive here) like the unexpected and uninvited ringing of the doorbell. I swear I can tell when it's someone at the door trying to sell me something just by the sound of the damn thing. It's not the regular doorbell sound that you hear when children come to the door selling chocolate bars or cookies for their schools. No, it's an evil, spine-tingling sound straight from Transylvania that says "I want your blood, but I'll settle for your credit card." Oh, almost forgot the evil, cackling laughter. "HAA, HAa, Haa, haa, ha..." Whatever it is, I don't want it. I have all the appliances, insurance and religion I'll ever need. As for the Girl Scouts and their cookies, well, nobody's perfect. Exemption granted. But what's a guy to do when the soliciting demon approacheth? As much as I love my house I have no desire to cower behind permanently deadbolted doors for the rest of my life.  I thought about putting a bear trap outside the front door, but do you know how hard it is to clean one of those things? No thanks. Electrifying the doorbell button seemed like a novel approach, except that hydro is too expensive and charred flesh on the front porch can only bring down the property value. Nope, none of these will do. So instead, I'm sending a form letter to door-to-door solicitors everywhere. So far I've written two, but I can't decide which one will be more effective. What do you think of the following:   OPTION A   Dear Solicitor, I am writing this letter to express my dismay at your appearance on my doorstep this morning. It was an interruption to my daily routine that had an enormous negative impact on the rest of my day. I know that you are only doing your job. Everyone has to put food on the table. But there simply has to be a better way of earning one's keep. To put it another way, you simply can't win with this endeavour. As someone who likes his peace and quiet, I urge you to stop ringing people's doorbells. Time is a valuable resource, and you are surely getting a poor return on your investment. I hope that my feedback will be of some use to you. Unfortunately, you will not be afforded a chance for any sort of rebuttal.   Sincerely, Will   OPTION B  Hey Solicitor, EAT MY SHORTS!!! And if you’re at it lick your Grandma she needs it! Bitterly, A Dissatisfied Non-customer   The voting is now open in the comments section. Stay tuned...  Lalalala! More poetry by yours truly to of course my beautiful boi Fabi!  Sometime I wonder how  People judge our love They never seem to notice that  It is in the form of kisses and hugs Or theat is seems to stem  From some Heaven that is above But if our love is strong  And true and solid to the soul Then listening to them  Is not what we’ll do Our love will be bold The love we have  Will shine through storms No matter how rough the time Forever and ever,  We’ll be together like the sun. Yes, it will shine Yes, we forever shall shine!

      Dear Chocolate Chip Mint Ice Cream,  	I know that we've been, err, involved, for a while now and I know that you've forgiven me for that incident with the Cookie Dough Ice Cream. I swear I didn't know that you were related and I am truly sorry...  But most importantly, I just wanted you to know, I think I love you.  You didn't glare at me like my teddy bear did last night when I came in at 2 a.m. You didn't remind me how I had killed so many brain cells with a concoction of weird girly drinks and beer. You didn't reprimand me for slapping that guy for-whatever-reason-that-made-perfect-sense-last-night and even reminded me that I've only slapped perhaps two people in my life.  Instead, you gushed about the random call from boy and laughed about the cute guy who picked me up. Literally picked me up to move in front of me to protect me from slapped-guy who was threatening to punch me. And most importantly? When I told you that I kicked butt at racing cars at Dale‘s you didn't laugh and point out 'how cute a girly-girl' I was. You just hung out in my bowl and stayed cool and kept a straight face. And finally, thank you for not making fun of the fact that I can't seem to say 'no' and got suckered into working for free.  I'll miss the spooning when I'm on a diet. Perhaps we'll write. Love,  Will   Help! I'm living life in a fishbowl! I can't seem to see through the icky green slime coating the inside from the little fishies in here. Have I mentioned that fish freak me out? Ok. Gross fish imagery. But really, don't you ever feel like you're completely changing atmosphere and location when you do different things? No? Have no ideas what the heck I'm talking about? That's fine too.  I suppose I feel like I'm living a triple life. It's weird. I can't possibly explain without risk of being put away. And then what would you do without the white noise? You know what? I'm tired of sharing. That's what it is. I've shared since I was 0, Dammit. That's enough time. Gimme my stuff back! *shove* I'm also hungry. But that would require effort. Look, it's been a long day. I've been up since 7 and had meetings and then class all day AND I had to kill 3 bosses on level nine for my nephew. It's exhausting being this cool. It's not for the weak-minded.  Careful kids! Wear some wrist guards and a helmet. Yeah. Are there actually people who have sexy voices when they're sick? People keep making jokes about my voice and then we agree that I decidedly do not sound sexy. So who are these sexy sounding people who overcome illness and coughing and boxes of Kleenex? I feel sorta like Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail. Cute as usual, ;) but not sexy sounding. She just sounds gross and sick. Okay enough! So I've been thinking about memories and the whole lacunainc.com parody thingy. If you could get rid of memories, would you? I haven't seen the movie but I, personally, would not. My immediate reaction was hell-yeah! But as someone wise pointed out, then I wouldn't remember why my exes made me mad or why it was bad to touch a hot iron. (Two rather similar circumstances I do assure you!)  However, despite repeated incidents, I still make the same mistakes. I still end up with the all-nighters and broken hearts.  Why, hello Melodrama! Glad you could stop by!  But seriously, it's like knowing that there's a huge scary purple blob with seven (or for those whom can’t understand the written form 7) eyes in the closet but you keep opening the door despite past experience of how hard it is to shut the door once it's opened. I need a deadbolt.  Or less sinus medication that makes me weirder than usual.  Blog is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. I am going to go blog your face into little pieces. I am going to go blog at the next flag football game. It suits all situations. Gotta tell your kid to stop doing drugs just say this, "You're the stupidest little blog that I have ever bloggin' seen when I was younger we got blogged for just thinking about it, Blog you." Some people call me hot sauce since I am so skilled in every way possible just like hot sauce you know. Since this is one of those stupid posts on this bound to be interesting site, I will describe my right kneecap... I guess it can be described as elliptical and definitely not soft. In summary my kneecap is not French.  I wish seeing Riley was easier, I heart the boi massively.  He is so frickin’ amazing yall!  *sighs* More things from the bathroom floor.  When I met you boy you was the sweetest thing Like a Sade tape in the coldest spring When I saw your eyes I thought they shined for me Just being in your space was divine me Gave you true smiles and a lot more time Then them balling cats who fiend to be mine... And some would say I should have never came closer But I ain't never had the taste for the phrase not supposed to So I chose imagine that Put a plan into play to make it public fact That I'm the one and you should have knew That them other bois have never loved you like I do Might have took some time but most good things do Manifest when the time is true I admit I was nervous ‘cause things get changed Something about my lifestyle makes love so strange So many angles and tangled components Everybody wanna touch just for the moment But you put a new hue in my blue Added a perspective to my concrete views About tossing caution into the breeze Following emotion like streams to the seas Top priority believe you me Like love how you feel, you alright, what do you need? It's more than your lips on the nap of my neck Or your hands on my chest, with your leg on my thigh Or the look in your eyes as you slide inside It's the way you make me melt and fall apart even though I’ve tried Baby, I heart you so much  And can’t wait again to the telephone or to the touch

      I went to Movie Gallery today and there was this really femme guy that was working there.  Really feminine… He was limp-wristed and had high pitched voice, not attractive at all.  Really he was replusive like he weighted a maximum of 100 pounds… I was like eww!  Anyways so he was working with this other guy, who wasn’t much better.  Well, Big Mama wanted to preorder a movie and they didn’t know how to work it.  None what so ever, like this kind of thing never happens… I mean who was in charge of their training and exactly what kind of training are they given, and then we found it, peicing together visual clues.  The femme one’s pant zipper was down, and well not some what all the way unzipped, sweat beaded on their faces and two waded-up napkins on the ground.  We we’re the only people in the store and it opened four minutes before we got in there… You tell me?     So, it is wrong to have a crush on the Schwans guy?  I mean he is like twenty-thirty something and I know he is gay, and I know there is very little that I can do with him or that I would do with him, but still I am attracted to him.  Not to downplay me and Fabi. I would never ever dream or fathom leaving my beautiful boi.  He means the world to me and in my eyes will continue to be the sexiest boi in the world.  And did I mention that he has this awesome aura and personality that brightens my day through one minute of being exposed to his radiant energy that I will call love?  So, yeah!  Words are lost, yet faith reassured You came and took me. Even though I've come undone. I wanna embrace in your love. ’Cause your love shinning so bright. I don’t feel no solitude, for I’m with you  You cast an undying love spell on me, And drowned me in your love, I cant believe how you made me feel. I wanna hold you tight And kiss you good night. I can never find a way out this, And I simply never want to. I'm not sure if I deserve your love, But you give me all of it.  Thank you for this, babe I can never untangle myself from this web, I simply love you so much. I can say 'I love you' a thousand and million times, but it still can never be enough to show, just how much I really really love you. And please don’t be dubious of my words I just can’t show you how much it’s true. I've left the past behind, And stepped into this beginning  Only with you in me. And Im going to carry on this journey.. With only you here beside me  I gonna show you my thoughts and words   How much I truly care   Baby you are the world,  I wanna make it all for you      What are you? You're a sac of consciousness separated from reality by a vibrating membrane only 2mm thick in most places called "skin." This skin is tissue that ends yourself and where begins your external world. This skin is an organ which itself breathes, but is sustained by the breath of your organism. This skin is made up of the same basic shit that makes up your internal organs and, most importantly, your brain. But, what's really interesting is to think about where your body ends.  Where does a body end? With your skin? Partially. But, do you feel wrapped up in a sac of skin? Or do you, like most people, feel that you are something esoteric and invisible, some strange entity almost "encased" in a shell that is neither part of neither said shell nor really, definitively contained within said shell? You absolutely know that when the shell dies, you (whatever that is) also die (or is at least unrecognizable). Yet, the most basic understanding of who you are is understood by your most basic relationship to the environment in which you exist. For most people, as thinking creatures, they "get off" by understanding their relationship to the environment by understanding their interactions with other people; to be without another thinking person would be HELL to most people, an existence WORSE THAN PRISON. However, interaction with the environment occurs on the most basic level, which is also a level that happens to be the most mind-blowing (and I mean "mind-blowing" in a good way! Don't take the following example "for instance," but take it "for all it's worth"... okay?)

        Things appear other than as we know them: they appear without the mitigating circumstance of their transitory nature. This mitigating circumstance prevents us from coming to a verdict. For how can we condemn something that is ephemeral, in transit? In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.    How am I to react to this slander?  Well, life and fate shall sentence the ignorant and the fools.  Will I delete them?  No.  Will I let them stand? Yes. To these  rapscallion or for their stupid asses sake a rascal, ne'er-do-well peice of shit individauls it seems to me if they have any balls or a dick for that matter that a message with some identifing factor would have been placed.  But alas these dickless, spineless subhumaniod developmental rejects don't have the gonads that it takes.  *smiles* Yes, Fabi and I will fuck eachother and gladly go to Hell for it. Better than any sex you will ever get I assure you.  *smiles* Baby, I heart you massively! P.S.- to these individual look on the comments for Friday March 19th, 2004 Fabi wrote in response to you, and all other readers indulge yourself in my boi's writing... And on a final note to whom it is be careful, very fucking careful.  YOU FUCK WITH A FLAMER AND YOU ARE GONNA GET YOUR ASS BURNED!   Long time, okay like 3 days… I had to prove that it didn’t own me… I was worried but see below!  Mrhahahahahahahahah! It don’t!       18.75 %          My weblog owns 18.75 % of me.  urlLink Does your weblog own you?   As for thinks that might … writing and Fabi.  He is the bomb shite, yo!  It is so amazing to have an attractive, gorgeous sweet, kind, smart, caring, sensitive, mature (did I mention hott?) boi to cradle in my arms and to be able to love him as much as he loves me.  It is tres spiffy!    Ask me how long will I love you? Will I love you forever? No, I won’t. Will I love you for as long as the sun shines? No, I won’t. Will I love you for as long as time permits? No, I won’t. But, I will love you... Until the day you stop loving me. Or will I love you, until the day you stop loving me? NO. I will still love you... Even after you've stopped loving me.   I am very touched for what you have said to me, It worth more than a million. I am appreciative to what you have done, I do not know what good can I give in return. I try to protect you but if I do that,  It may do you more harm than good. I remain silent. Your words hold so much resonance for me, They are all in a book and I cherish it like a bible. The journey is uncharted, but I want run to the long, winding road laid with rubble. I know you will support me through with confidence. And the resonance my heart, The calling out towards you I know not where I am  Or where I shall being going But I will do it by your side My promise for always   I don't hate anyone. Maybe sometimes I wish I did, but I don't. The impulse is to follow this statement up with: "except... [and make jokes about people who do annoying little things I don't understand]." But, the truth is, I don't hate anyone. Temporarily, I get frustrated with lots of people, sure. But, how do you hate anyone at all, if you know "where it's at," to use a lame phrase? I mean, really?! Do you know where "it's at?"  Have you realized in your darkest hour that you need something, some kind of help, some kind of drug or whatever to get you "normal" again? Because, whatever it is that you feel, you just don't "feel" NORMAL! You can lay in bed for an entire day or a week and you feel like a disaster because you just can't MAKE YOURSELF do the things you have to do. Or, you just need something to get you "jazzed" about living again (i.e. fucked up)? It's all, your life, a series of barely-controllable circumstances you were born into which are YOUR responsibility to learn how to CONTROL in a way that you see fit AND in a way that society sees fit. It doesn't matter if your father was a drunk rapist who ended up in jail or that your mom tried to have sex with your best friend once when she caught you and your buddies sneaking a drink from the liquor cabinet... or that you were taunted and beaten mercilessly throughout your high school years. None of this matters. Your job is to make the best of it and not to implode or explode, but to simply FIT IN. In the 1950's they wrote actual self-help books which were GEARED toward teaching people how to be a "cog in the machine" (YES they actually used that phrase! At that point in time, the industrial revolution was seen as a brilliant evolutionary step!)   It's true, you don't remember making a conscious decision to live on this planet; you just popped out of the void into this life. But, still, not being prepared is no excuse. You're here. Deal with it.  If life goes you cherries then make pie.  And if you get a shit load of them well, there is cobbler  Perhaps you were born a minority in the good ol' USA. Tough titty for you that it's going to be just that much harder to achieve your goals. Maybe you have a chemical imbalance that most people just don't understand (which is funny, if you think about it, because just about everyone is chemically imbalanced). You might start taking a pill out of desperation that really starts putting everything into "focus." At this point, you're shocked. You wonder: "Who am I? I seem to be dependent on a chemical reaction... this little pill makes seemingly insignificant chemical changes in my brain that makes everything about my personality that I had previously known and loved as 'myself' (to whatever extent possible as a self-hating, confused, depressed creature) completely DIFFERENT and more "normal" and BETTER!... Suddenly everything is just... hard to explain... but, everything is different. I'm a different person, I'm a person much closer to what I've always wanted to be!"  And what happens when it's time to ease off the chemical? Who are you then? Who are you when some "authority" switches you to a new chemical as a replacement?  Well, it would seem that you're fucked. What are you? You're not your memories and you're not your thoughts. The chemicals have proven that: with new chemicals, all your old memories seem false, all your thoughts are different. Everything is different... and yet, there you are... still in your skull, watching the world unfold. But, are you actually prepared to say you are nothing more than chemicals? This makes all thoughts secondary: Bach and Mozart weren't creating brilliant music; just the fecal outporings of chemical reactions! Was Einstein a genius? Of course he was!

Why can’t I drive?  Why can’t I like have a good group of friends, I mean they are good, but no real driving individuals…    Day Tenn. County Wants to Charge Homosexuals DAYTON, Tenn. (AP) - The county that was the site of the Scopes ``Monkey Trial'' over the teaching of evolution is asking lawmakers to amend state law so the county can charge homosexuals with crimes against nature. The Rhea County commissioners approved the request 8-0 Tuesday.  Commissioner J.C. Fugate, who introduced the measure, also asked the county attorney to find a way to enact an ordinance banning homosexuals from living in the county. ``We need to keep them out of here,'' Fugate said. The vote was denounced by Matt Nevels, president of the Chattanooga chapter of Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. ``That is the most farfetched idea put forth by any kind of public official,'' Nevels said. ``I'm outraged.'' Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Texas' sodomy laws as a violation of adults' privacy. Rhea County is one of the most conservative counties in Tennessee. It holds an annual festival commemorating the 1925 trial at which John T. Scopes was convicted of teaching evolution. The verdict was thrown out on a technicality. The trial became the subject of the play and movie ``Inherit the Wind.''  In 2002, a federal judge ruled unconstitutional the teaching of a Bible class in the public schools.  Fuck this rural reject asinine ignorance fucking cunt-bag county.  Screw them into the ground, I hope to God you mayor is gay, it would serve you justly!  STARRY STARRY NIGHT Allow me to geek it up a bit... or is that nerd out... There is big news in the astronomy community with the discovery of a new planetoid orbiting the Sun. Sedna, as it has been unofficially named is the latest object to be found in our solar system. Quaoar was found in 2002 in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune.  Ok... Have I tossed out enough nonsensical words to make you wonder if I'm talking about real life or an episode of Star Trek?  I guess that is my whole point for being so excited about this, as I am. Right now is a truly exciting time. We have robots exploring Mars. There is talk of another Moon landing. We have discovered other objects that might one day be considered planets. If you enjoy anything about space and outer space sci-fi then I'm sure you are just wet with excitement. Yet, there is a down side to this... The two possible planetary candidates are currently stuck in planetoid status. Quaoar and Sedna while relatively close in size to Pluto are actually threatening Pluto's status as a full-fledged planet. Scientists go round and round on this all the time. Big deal... We have Inner Planets... (Mercury, Venus, Earth, & Mars) We have Outer Planets... (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, & Pluto) Why not have another grouping of planets? Group Pluto with Quaoar and Sedna and give them a fancy name that only the really anal retentive will ever remember to use.  I know I won't see it in my lifetime, but the idea that someday Earth might be sending a robot to explore planet Sedna is an amazing dream.  Too often, we lost sight of life’s simple pleasures.  Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown, but it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap that mother@#?!&! upside their head!   -I hate Anthony’s catfish. It looks gross and creeps me out. It’s like a skeleton fish, a see through albino skeleton fish. -I’ve got money because the dollar bills have been collecting. Woohoo.  -I and Fabi will have fun downtown times. Can’t wait. -I need to actually pick up the phone and phone people so I can see them. But I’m dead tired today, so I will do it tomorrow. -I’m going to pick up drinking cognac/scotch/whisky on rocks. Because you know, I need the help in being more old lady like.  Will:  John, I love you  Will: But asexually, not emotional desires, yeah.  I am taken, but I do love you… John: What like a plant?  Will: Yes, exactly!  There glad that is clear!

      So a few people other than family have been here now *bites inner lip in trepidation* It appears to be all of the good that it can be, and I am glad for the feedback. Thing about it is, (something that I have to work on) is that I come here to vent. Rant. Be vexed. Fuss. Contemplate. Mull over. Ya get the idea. I don't come here when I am in all kinds of a great mood. And I'm thinking that I should. Writing has always been my therapy. It is the tool that I use to plaster things back together inside my head. I'm thinking if I start recognizing the lighter side of me, I can lay off on the melancholy a little bit. Not too much now, I'm not trying to scare myself or anything...I feel that I am being redundant at the moment, and this motivates me to get to the point. From now on, in addition to (b/c I think the manner in which I transcribe my stuff is what makes me unique) the usually "hey world, go find a poker game and leave me alone" attitude, I'm gonna try to start relating some of the funny/bizarre/interesting/breathtaking/great cool wonderful things that happen to me.  And my foot STILL hurts.  Weird animal news  Afghan soldier couldn't afford to get married. He ends up being arrested for having sex with a donkey. Desperate times ... desperate measures. A kangaroo viciously attacked a woman in her garden. A bobcat viciously attacked a woman in her basement. Chinese veterinarians are showing a panda American sex ed videos so it will be ready to mate.  Jim Rindhage is a professional dog poop scooper. Bird poop destroying Norwegian bridge. Man dies of heart attack and pneumonia, but police launching a murder investigation because his genitals have been removed and may have been eaten by the dog. Dogs trained during World War II to run under tanks with explosives. Unfortunately, they were indiscriminate about which tanks they'd run under. In Idaho Falls, a cow escaped a farm and had to be chased down by police. The cow cut the tendon of an animal control officer and it made its displeasure with police known: Police Sgt. David Frei tried to herd the cow by driving beside it. The cow rammed into his Ford Explorer, denting a front panel, and then disappeared somewhere south, witnesses said.  I am a lover of fabulous conversations. Ones where neither party is complaining or smack talking or worrying or telling of a recent event, but where a higher level is achieved. Philosophical, if you will. Theoretical, too. Maybe a little bit with the opinions and ideas that are so unique to an individual. Deep breath, and...too the point, I had one of those Sat. night. A good old conversation about God that actually made me think.   My attention is evading my control, so I'll be back to this later...oh boy.   Fabi, lol, wow, I still falling, for like 2 weeks and I am not hitting bottom, I hope I don't I am at terminal velocity between 40.7 to 55.8 m/s... and it is gonna hurt to hit...  Lol, I never think I will!  Riley boi, I heart you!  Much stars and hearts You, you are, oh you are The little boy made for me in the stars In the stars, that's why I can't let you go The little boy made for me in the stars That's why I love you more the further I go And before this existence you were always there Waiting for me You are, you are the realest thing I know Hands down The realest thing I know I am not used to being carried Or being able to carry a pretty song I have been bruised by my many trails Sometimes my skin's so thick it's frail I just need to be ignored 'til I wake up to the beauty that is yours And it all comes to life so, so suddenly This is a place so deep, the water's so deep I hesitate, cause All the energy it takes to feel this power I tend to run, I tend to hide, 'til I find you and I know I got you I know, I know, I know You're the little boy made for me in the stars In the stars, that's why I can't let you go The little boy made for me in the stars That's why I love you more the further I go And before this existence you were always here Inside of me You are, you are the realest thing I know Hands down...the realest thing I know I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams When you carry me, when you carry me, when you carry me It's so happy I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams I'm sliding on the rainbows of my childhood dreams

      Well, pooey!  So, I wasted 65 pages and then of course there is an error on all but one of them so 65-13 is 52.  52 more pages, so I am at 115 and then the permission slip and the initial entry of 5 and 4 more, we are at 124 pages, and I am not going because Mr. Gast the advisor is sick, and I have none of my books… and I am still here in school…  See if you say I am not dedicated well then bite me. Grarrg, it is okay… I will live it out, know?  But still that is a lot of paper and then the ink!  And also the toner! So much waste in this world!  Grrarg!  [5 minutes on life] Life is a random series of moments in time, insignificant to most everything else in life, important to you though. If I never had existed no one would have missed me, no one would have ever known that I was to exist.  Life should be lived, not worried about. Celebrate life, live life, don't regret life. Rejoice this is your turn.  Walk out on stage with you head held high and your smile on.  Shine all that you can.  This is your life.  You are the star of this show.  Live and learn as they say, but remember, "live" is first. People should get out and experience the wonders of life. Don't get bogged down in the little things of life, if you have a bad day, then go to sleep and wake up to a new one, and make it the best day of your life.  If life is in a rut, then get out, if you’re driving down a road and get trapped in a rut, you don't follow it, you slow down, and pull out. You must do the same in life, if you find yourself stuck, slowdown, think, and get out as soon as you can. One day you won't wake up, don't worry about it, you can't miss the things. You haven't done once you left this world.  Remember, it’s your life, live it how you wish. You have to stay in control. If you choose to give up that control, make sure it’s to someone you trust. -------------Fate will prevail always, things that happen in life happen for the better weather or not it seems like it at first, but down the road you realize it was for the better.  [5 Minutes on Trusting Your Gut]  Sometimes, not often, but sometimes your guts can make up your mind for you. Sometimes when you see, or hear, or smell, or sometimes even think about something you will get what can only be described as a gut reaction. I only get these reactions during one of two events. The first is when I know I am in trouble. I mean real trouble. When I was a kid it was when I realized that whatever I just did I am going to get caught and punished. Be it breaking a lamp or getting a shitty report card. The instant that I comprehended exactly what the ramifications for my errant actions were going to be something happened to my guts. Like a little tiny black hole opened in my abdomen and a sucking vortex of guilt and dread were tugging on the mile and a half of my lower GI. It's not a good feeling. Now, the other time I feel something from belly is when, and this is going to come out so fucking gay, I am thinking about a guy I know I like. This does not happen when I see hot girls this only happens when I think about a boy that I really, really, like even if right up until that point I didn't even know it. I'll just be thinking about him and all the sudden my shit tubes will jump a little bit. It's like a girlish little glee-hiccup. This internal guffaw is both unsettling and wonderfully uplifting at the same time. When it happens to me in this capacity, that is to say when my very biology is telling me that this boi is something special, I consider the best advise I could get. For the record, this is not some notion I am putting to paper (or its equivalent) for the fuck of it. I am obviously pining like a little loser over someone in particular so I'll just put it out there. Unbelievably it's Riley Paul-Patrick Hays, he still makes my insides churn every time I fucking speak to him. Now that's saying something.   NOT RELAVENT TO ABOVE I put my trust in you  and you betrayed me  Took what I gave you  and fucking raped me  But you can't kill me...  It's not that easy  I'm still standing  Still breathing!  Spitfire  Spite hate Spit all the shit you talk  Right back in your face  I spit liars  I spit names  I spit truth  And my song remains the same!  I gave you faith  When none believed you  Barely escaped....  But who decieved who?  You tried to guilt me  with things you'd tell me...  You didn't build me  You can't sell me  Fuck your label!

       Gay marriages, civil unions, what's the big deal?  What is the bug up so many people's asses about this? So what if gays and lesbians want to get married, it's the 21st century get over it. I love how our politicians and religious leaders defend the sanctity of marriage and what it means for the development of a child. I'm the product of divorced parents, how was I raised with family values and what example did it set for me? With a divorce rate of over 50% in this country family values is such a farse. There has never been a family like "Leave it to Beaver" in this country, and if so it was just as dysfunctional as any other. I have several gay and lesbian couples as friends and seeing them getting married doesn't phase me in the least. I think Jared and Bry are very cute together and they are a great couple.  I am going to their wedding in August.  I also deserve to walk down an aisle.  If I wanted to adopt a child it shouldn't bother anyone one bit. Hey, it's better than the child growing up on foster care and feeling unloved, unwanted, and unimportant. People think that if gays and lesbians get married the social structure of the nation will crumble, this is such crap. The bottom line is that the United States is still just as rigid and narrow minded as it has been since the early days of civil rights. This is simply another group of people being discriminated because they are different. This time it's not based off of skin color, but sexual orientation. It's the same old dance just different music, and it's ridiculous. Civil unions should be allowable and recognized. Many businesses in the nation acknowledge alternative relationships and benefits are actually afforded to partners. Harvard is very proactive on this topic.  It's sad that in nation where we consider ourselves a nation of personal freedoms and liberties that it is simply a facade. And to hear President Bush want to change the Constitution regarding this matter is truly disturbing. With his board of anti-American cronies our country has changed drastically in four years. Watch out, you’re next!     Difference Between Focus on Problems, and Focus on Solutions !!   When NASA began the launch of astronauts into space, they found out that the pens wouldn't work at zero gravity (Ink won't flow down to the writing surface). In order to solve this problem, they hired Andersen Consulting (Accenture today). It took them one decade and $12 million. They developed a pen that worked at zero gravity, upside down, underwater, in practically any surface including crystal and in a temperature range from below freezing to over 300 degrees C.     Any guesses on what U.S’s archrivals used?? What did Russians do?  The Russians used a Pencil!!!    Didn't have a good day but didn't have a bad one either. As I was thinking about this blog, I find myself falling into the "poor me" episodes we all have. Yeah, I have bad days but honestly, I am very content with my life. It is rather uncomplicated. I found Mr. Right, well I can't think of a better way to live.  -I clean the house that I messed up when I want. -I cook (badly) and throw away the carton - no dishes. -I hog the covers. -I don't shower on the weekends if I don't want to (however, I don't leave the house that day either). -I usually agree with everything I say. -I never irritate myself (almost never). -It's not as offensive when I look in the mirror and say "you need to loose a little weight." -I don't have a disapproving mother-in-law.   I went a Math Competition and did okays…  Not great but when I went home Big Mama had a Subway sandwich for me!  I was happy!  Lol, Daddy is off to South Dakota, so me and Mama are off to the video store!  Wohoo!  Scary Flick Night wit’ my Chick, lol!  And tomorrow I will be in LaCrosse for this Creative Writing Festival and like I had to print out 13 copies of 5 pages, double-spaced.  I am thinking I have killed a tree for this 65 pages in one day?  Count it, one, two, three, four... And then the registration paper and name- tags and such!  DAMN WE ARE WASTEFUL!  That is like a crap load of trees!  Seriously!  Mauston alone is like 500 sheets!  Grarrrg!  Makes you think you know! So, I tried to write a song…  Lol, my bad attempt but you know it’s for Fabi, and I could be the worst person at writing and he would appreciate my work.  Lol, it isn’t bad though… I think it is okay…  Well, hearts and bright stars to Riley!     Don’t be afraid, this won’t hurt Have some faith this is real Together all these feelings we can sort We together can feel If you just believe in me If you can ever wish to understand If you wish to stay And, let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me… Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Don’t let it slip away like grains of sand Just take my hand  Don’t worry at all, this is fine Have some passion, this is real Together we will never draw the line We together can feel If you just believe in me If you ever wish to understand If you ever wish to stay And, let your own thoughts run free If you believe in me… Take my hand Walk together with me Take my hand Let me guide you to a special land Take my hand Don’t let it slip away like grains of sand Just take my hand  And believe in what is there In you… In me…

       Things I learned from watching this week’s The L Word:   -Skinny boys have the biggest cocks. -Straight people feel discriminated by the police against when they live in a gay mecca. -Teenagers are just dying to give their drugs away to strangers. -You should be careful about being a lesbian because one time these two girls got caught going down on each other in a fast food restaurant so their parents sent them away to different boarding schools and one of them killed herself. -Jenny’s writing fails to improve when she is high on shrooms. -You can sue someone for accepting your boyfriend’s sperm donation. -The phrase “liquor in the front, poker in the rear” makes me giggle every time I hear it. -Calling yourself a lesbian-identified man amounts to giving up your straight male privilege and making yourself a second class citizen.  Ah!  To Fabi, my boi, I heart you!  Dis’ weekend should rock!  Lol, I will be so out of Necedah.com!    You only wanted to dance with me 'cause you're lone again But I heard you whispering things that I want forget Suddently we kissed and we were spinning around I feel for you and when I look into your eyes I decide that everything's gonna be alright All the time And when I look into your eyes I decide that everything's gonna be alright all the time I know it's not even reality to you But I'm trembling every morning when I wake up thinking of you I'm thinking about you too So send me a light I feel for you and when I look into your eyes I decide that everything is gonna be alright All the time 'Cause when I look into your Eyes I decide that everything is gonna be al-right All the time And when I look into your eyes I decide Everything is gonna be alright All the time All the time   An open letter to the person who wrote the hateful email at work, then accidentally sent it to the wrong recipient:  Hi,  I got your e-mail a few minutes ago. You say that you would rather slit your wrists "with jagged glass than ever work with those such idiots on.  Prom Committee. " Since I work on the as chair, and since you took the time from your busy schedule to compose and send me your feelings, I must consider your correspondence a "cry for help." And I want you to know that I'm here for you. I must also ask you one very serious question: What's stopping you? I'm sure you realize that your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for ultimate self-sacrifice could be also your inalterable ultimatum for those OTHER Prom numbskulls who fail to appreciate your demigod-like mastership of all things technically correct. Since you called out to me in your time of distress, let me offer your some heart-felt support: Be the person of principle that you say you are! Exclaim your superior creative intellect to the world! Like you suggested in your email, I agree that before "the act" you should decorate your bathroom with roses or dead animals or how about the carcasses of your 12 cats, stuffed into a rose-shaped potpourri basket! And, while you're at it, why not write something meaningful or religious, in your own blood, as you slowly bleed to death? Imagine the possibilities! And imagine those unappreciative fiends, gasping in disbelief as the read your last words: "I TOLD YOU I WAS SERIOUS!" or "BOW TO THEE, HEATHENS!" or "COPY EDITORS DO IT WITH STYLE!"  That'll show 'em.     [5 Minutes on Getting it All Figured Out]   I honestly do believe that some folk wake up on his or her 8th birthday and stare at the ceiling and say, Holy shit, I totally want to be a banker, or a school teacher, or a stock broker. Or, a fireman. Unfortunately I believe that overwhelming majority of people grew up in houses where parents did something shitty, see part time retail, or something really boring, see account executive or CPA. Before we truly understand the value of money, despite what anyone says a person does not learn the value of money until he or she pays his or her own bills, we cannot associate "what do we want to be when we grow up" with a lucrative title. So what happens to us? We wake up one day when we're 18, when we're 22, when we're 38, when we're 64 and we realize that STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WE WANT TO DO WITH OUR LIVES. I'm trying to decide what's worse for me right now. Coming to grips with the fact that I may not have the smarts, money, family, ambition, work ethic to achieve my dreams or if I never really had a dream to begin with. Tomorrow will I wake up as a failure or just another tax payer who likes to treat himself to hot wings once in a while? That'll give you some insomnia.

       I think I picked the wrong extreme sport… or the wrong target.  Extreme Gay Guy Pouncing is great choice, but with Fabi as my goal, Ohh… we’re gonna get called for unsportsmanlike conduct.   Err!  Da boils me potatoes! Tis’ no one’s place to disapprove of me loved one.  It t’was not so pleasant.  Und, ye’ folk need to know what ya’ said wasn’t nice und won’t fair at all.  Riley is a good lad und he is mine.  Und, ya he is “femme,” but I am so.  I heart ‘im, mer dann ‘e knows. So, ya’ll got a problem denn take it up wit’ da good Lord.  ‘Er is mine.  Hearts und stars to he!  Back to dreamin’ uber mine Riley’s fair skin und ‘ers green emerald eyes…    In regards to some disapproving “so-called-friends”-  Words don’t and won’t express how I feel Only kind smiles can help us heal We need to admit whether or not this is real The wounds from them we can not conceal They opened their mouths and said so much And did it of course with much harm “Frickin’ Femme Punk Bitch” and such But, somehow you have disabled my alarm It doesn’t matter anymore We are together, let us even the score They may hate me, but I really don’t care They can never me away from you scare Nevermore they better not try, never dare It isn’t them; it is just you and me Together we in each other’s arms we can be  I is simply a game that we will have to play To push and to keep me away To stop us to keep the feelings at bay But simply not ever, to them declare “Nay” But together we can take a stand Reaching over to take your hand To stay, side by side I know that you know We have nothing to hide   Raping Animals If rape is sexual intercourse without an individual's consent, and if nonhuman animals (like underage humans) are incapable of consenting, then sexual intercourse with a nonhuman animal is rape (or the moral equivalent thereof). Here is an interesting  urlLink news  story in which a Dutch politician reaches that conclusion.  Virginia Is for Lovers Is this confusing or what? "Study Examines STD Rates of Teen Virgins," read the headline of an Associated Press dispatch yesterday. If they're virgins, wouldn't their STD (sexually transmitted disease) rate be zero by definition? Not according to Medical News Today, which headlines its story on the same subject "Virgins Have Same Rate of Sexually Transmitted Diseases as Non-virgins." Again, unless sexually transmitted diseases have been eradicated altogether, how could this be? MSNBC.com provides a little more information in its headline, which reads: "Teen 'Virgins' Face STD Risks, Study Finds." There's also a subheadline: "Less likely to use condoms than non-abstinent youth." Again, why would virgins use condoms at all, unless there were a shortage of balloons? MSNBC's scare quotes offer a clue to what this is all about, and a Reuters headline finally gives it away: "Teens Pledging Sex Abstinence Often Fail-Study." In other words, the defining characteristic of the teens the AP describes as "virgins" is that they've lost their virginity! Who'd've thunk it?

      Top o’ the Mornin’ to Ya! 	How are ye?  Oh, I tell ya I’ve been havin’ some freaky arse dreams as o’ late.  (I know, I know it is early for St. Patrick’s Day, but it was in my dream.)  So as I was tellin’ ya Riley has these peircin’ green emerald eyes, and ye know what I love ‘im for ‘em.  So, ya’!  In this her’ dream I had, Riley was conversing wit’ this thick Irish accent.  God, he was so fuckin’ cute, although not as cute as he is in real life.  And I was a stupid arse fool.  An’ some o’ the conversation was:    Disco: “Do they have Irish Spring soap in Ireland?” Fabi:  “O’ course not.  That stuff smells like cheap purfume, what ye think stand around cuttin’ up perfectly good bars of soap?” Disco:  “So why ye arses be kicked so bad by da’ English?” (Trying to sound Irish) Fabi:  “I reckon the same reason Poland fell like a house of cards to the Nazis.” Disco:  “So, I need to know, are you after me Lucky Charms, Mister Hays?  Do ye think I be magically delicious?” (Grinning) Fabi:  “You’ve not only some charm, ye have um all and I bet some are lucky, me boy.” (Walking closer to Disco) Well, I assume that ye all can finish off the thought processes inside of me mind…     The snow and ice are old, covered in rottiong layers of salt and sand and dog shit and garbage.  March is the ugliest month in this frickin’ state, the trees are bare, and the ground a dirty mess from freezing, then thawing, then again freezing.  Sure most of it is over, the sun shines brighter and longer every passing day but winter hangs on like a son of a bitch.  Even more so and tighter then a drowning man trying to pull you under with him.     Ah, again with the writing!  Bitch, you need to stop.  Fuck you nigga'!  I got some inspiration!   Oh, May the years be long May our hearts be strong May they never break nor bow May they never experience woe May I make you happy as you do me May we spend together forever and always be And, may things not get so rough May we know love alone is enough May I glance over and you be there May forever we know we do care May I always make you happy like you do to me May I always and forever be with thee And, may we love each other forever and ever May I never lose you, not now, not never May this be for all that transpires May this be for eternity, till life expires May I make you happy as you do me May we spend forever in each other’s arms and be   This is for those 1001 wishes And the 2000 more to come  This is for those great evenings  And everything that shall come This is for those nights passed together And those drifting-offs that will come This is for our laughter  And the riddle that will come This is for the salty, tears And to the hand that wipes them away But mostly this is for love And our futures together like a new day

      Dinner's Ready!  I made dinner last night, a small roast with onions and potatoes, side of broccoli and rolls. This is kind of exciting because I never cook, although I know how, partially because when I was a kid I was expected to take over making dinner from about age 12. Nobody ever really took the time to teach me what to do or how to do it, so I just putter along and ruin about every 4th endeavor. No, really. Not slightly burned cookies or too many onions in the soup. An hour worth of cooking and a dinner's worth of food, inedible and nicely plated for the garbage. But anyway, since I've been home with my folks I've started cooking again, as my mom is often confined to bed and my dad is like me and would rather eat out or have microwaved something, but mom can't stand the idea of not having some semblance of a June Cleaver experience. Really. She'll spend several hours, most days, fretting about what we're going to eat, just as though it matters. "Oh, I didn't thaw anything, we'll have to go to the store." "Mom, nobody cares. Reheat something. Or don't, we're grownups, we probably will find the will to eat standing up from the fridge before we starve to death." "Well, I just like things to be NICE." Sorry. This was just supposed to be about the nice little roast I cooked and almost didn't ruin.    Grrarg, I am head over heels, rolling down some grass ass hill, tumbling, stumbling in love with Fabi.  He is a real sweetheart.  What better guy to live a life in the loving arms of one's dearest?  And to have the heartbeat in synchronous tune with every beat a harbinger of hope and with that one lover?  And who better then him for that one taste, so sweet in the rising tempo of passion?  And I think only to live, to love and to breathe together - as one... (Sorry, I know, know a little to sappy.  Alas, that s how I feel)  Now we've got racoons! Do you think that the squirrels told the racoons that our house is a great place to crash? Our neighbor told me to look at the little footprints in the snow and follow them. Well, they went right under my back porch! I left a message for the squirrel removers to add TWO RACOONS to their list.  Racoons Eat Squirrels Commonwealth Wildlife Control was here to reset the squirrel trap and set up a racoon trap. Turns out that racoons eat squirrels. Bill, the trapper, says that you don't want racoons. They are worse than squirrels! Bill took the time to point out where the traps were all set and where all the squirrel urine is running down the side of the house. Bill says that squirrel urine will rot up my clapboards. He then went on to tell me about the breeding habits of squirrels and how they have babies in April. The squirrels are now building their nests out of anything they can find including insulation to power lines. That's bad because if they eat through the insulation, a fire could start and your whole house could burn down.  How do you kill grey squirrels?  We'd like to see them captured in a live capture trap then humanely killed by a gun or a blow to the head. Die! Squirrels Die!   5 Minutes on Secret Societies I don't make it a very big secret, I'm completely fascinated by the secret society. The free masons, illuminati, the stone cutters, even the elk's club. There was a part of me that always knew I would be in a fraternity. I was going to become the fourth person in my four person family to join a greek organization. I am still in high school I visited a semi-elite liberal arts school and there I saw one of the coolest things I'd ever seen. This one fraternity house had a huge elk head in its living room that had a secret compartment behind it. That compartment could only be reached by climbing a recessed ladder that started in the basement and went straight up two and half floors. From the head you could look out into the large main room. They showed this to me on my first visit. Me, not pledge, not a rush, not even a freshman but a visiting potential student! Even then I knew something had gone wrong in this house. Somewhere along the lines this brotherhood had really lost site of it's founding values. As I became indoctrinated into a house, more than a year later at a different college, it became clear that the elements of the ritual were considered tedious and as such were to be expedited along as quickly as possible. It was disappointing but still I looked forward to the times when secret handshakes and our one and only secret word were exchanged. We had password riddles and hand signals to spare, none were ever used. After having just watched Old School for the third time it became obvious to me that forming a new secret society could be done. Unfortunately it could no longer be based on social crutches associated with the college fraternity. I would need to find like minded individuals interested in forming a brotherhood even a sisterhood with the purpose of secrecy. The question becomes why do it? Why even form a society with no purpose other than to not let people know you've formed the society? We need something to protect, some secret to keep, even some group to persecute to give us meaning. Persecution does not seem to be the most alluring option of the limited field I have mentioned but what if the group being pursued is fictional. Phantoms, figments, complete farces? What if members of our society do something as mundane as dress in ghoulish outfits and scare the wits out of co-eds? After a few sightings of the supernatural a group emerges to hunt and dispel the monsters. The group begins to recruit very carefully and soon legend spreads about a secret cult of vampire hunters and witch neutralizers. The handful of men and women in charge of this sect are in fact the very people responsible for the phantasms, goblins, and lycanthropes that have suddenly emerged. While the new recruits only know their charge of defending the innocent. After a few years with new blood and the occasional "sighting" the tradition could carry on for years without aid from the founders.  I believe that that is something that can be done on a college campus or even a small town and I would love to try it.  Or form one now!  I will do that!  You see it isn’t that hard, start small then, grow!  Lol, my little secret society, I can’t tell you who will be in it, that is a secret, and the purpose is to be secret!  So, I am off to my secret society that is a secret, so SHHH.

      Grrarg!  I feel like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh.  I really frickin’ do.  Why can’t I be Tigger and bounce all over the place? , Lol, instead I am like an ass, in the middle of Winsconsin for all intensive purposes is Cow Country.  So, yep I am Eeyore…  I began plotting the demise of my worn-out garbage cans about a month ago, the last time I had to shovel snow. I was next to the end of the driveway, carving out a staging area large enough to snugly hold two 32-gallon cans and the recycling bin on collection days, until the next thaw, when they could resume their normal process of rolling around the front yard and street after being emptied and hurled hither and yon like frisbees by the trash collectors. When I bought them a number of years ago, they were state of the art, the envy of my 'hood's dented metal can contingent -- heavy plastic, with locking lids and cunningly-mounted wheels, to facilitate tilting-and-pulling. But I soon learned that the center of gravity on them gets all screwed up when you fill them with, well, garbage, and pulling them down the driveway becomes a burdensome process of tipping, lid-chasing, and trash retrieval. The alleged functionality of the wheels is defeated by the poor design, so now the bottom corners are all hole-y from years of being dragged and scraped along the blacktop, while the vestigial wheels mock me. I hate them with the white-hot intensity of a thousand suns, and was muttering to them as I dug out a snow-niche for them. "You're out of here in the spring, bastards. I'm going to get new cans, and I'm getting one of those garbage can carts to house and haul them. You're history, you two."  One of my neighbors came by in his car, interrupting my insane monologue to tell me he was looking for his garbage cans, which had escaped during the pre-dawn hours and disappeared. "But it's not even windy," I commented. "I know," he said. "That's what I don't understand. And they were full. How far could they have gotten? They don't even have wheels. They weren't a flight risk."   Bleating arseholes Man, I'm so sick to death of: 1. Bleating arsehole, middle-aged, stupid, coddled, overpaid columnists who only write about babies, dogs, tv, traffic and cellphones 2. Bagless politicians 3. Sociopathic third-year law students 4. Hasassing emails (see also: sociopathic third-year law students) 5. Inordinately long, flossy, mail-order catalog prose (does "sesquipedalian" really belong in a story about grade-school spelling bee contestants? Two words for ya, Edgar Allen: Mensa-stic malapropism.) 6. Johnny Depp (a joke, lovey. anyway, where ya been? ... call me.) 7. Ann Coulter (Chupacabra?) 8. The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre (see also: "The Passion of the Christ." ... I hear part 2 will co-star Dennis Hopper with Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys) 9. Almost anything not written by Kirk Read (your own ribald witticism here: ____________) 10. Ice  It was the weirdest thing yesterday. I turned off the lights, and closed my eyes to go to sleep. You know how, if your environment is not pitch dark, you still can see 'lights' and shadows even when your eyes are closed. Well, not long after I closed my eyes, I started seeing... the dark and the lights shift around. And they were forming into a series of shifting shapes. Almost as though I was flying over shifting valleys and mountains -- with lots of holes and bumps. At first I figured it would just go away. But after couple minutes, I couldn't take it anymore. I was starting to feel dizzy and getting the falling sensation -- while lying on my own bed! So sick of it, I turned my lamp on and switched the TV on.  Then it hit me. The room started to wobble around me. Just like the shadows when my eyes were closed, only it was happening with the shapes and colors of the bed, the doors, the desk, books.... anything and everything around me. I don't think I was "dizzy" anymore - the feel of it was different. Nothing that I had experienced before. Everything was elastic, shifting towards and away from me. Seriously wobbling. For a while I tried to ignore it, but when the people on TV started to grow or shrink in size... I had it enough. I was definately lacking something; and it was freaking me out.  So I grabbed the tub of raisins I have and ate a handful - for iron. Then, got up, made my way to the kitchen - with my arms stretched out (just in case I bumped into anything), and poured myself a cup of juice - perfect source for sugar and vitamin C.  Fortunately enough, it did go away. Only after I made it back to my bed and sat there blinking at the ceiling like some stupid owl. I think I am iron deficient or something. I used to be slightly anemic as a kid, and I wonder if that's coming back. *sigh* I only hope it doesn't happen again.  Fabi is really quite stellar!  He is really one of the sweetest bois in this world.  I am soooo glad to have him in my life.  And, and and I talked to Fabi for an hour last night, I was so happy to hear his voice; a rich, melodious soothing voice was soooo good.  I fell asleep gripping my body pillow, thinking all the time how much I wish it to be him.  How much I wish transmogrification was a real science.  Alas, my dreams were pleasure and filled with him.  The simple thoughts of lying against his stomach, glancing upwards to watch his chest rise and fall, feeling our hand intertwine, touching his smooth, milky-white skin, feeling his hands on my body, nothing racy, simple and clean, listening to sweet every-things, kissing his strong, yet smooth hands, staring in his amazing eyes, and drifting off to sleep with the one I love.  After this dream, after trip into the bathroom floor, where my late night writings occur, this poem was produced: Oh, since I am young as I am still now Oh, since my heart packed away inside What great wonder and surprise   To glance, to chance into your eyes To dive, to jump into pools deep jade green To gaze, to stare into haze, nice and clear Oh, do you eyes sparkle, glimmer and shine Oh, do your eyes light up when greeted my mine To dance to twirl into your eyes To live to love in eye, so pure emerald To try, to risk, it all for one day with you Oh, no matter, none at all In your eyes is where I wish to be.  Well, I am about to bounce, but wait I am Eeyore damn.

      I have come to the conclusion that I have in fact broken my shoes.  Not ripped or torn or anything of that nature but the back on my kick ass pony shoes, the blue suede leather ones that match my messenger bag to the T.  Well, they make this odd noise when I walk. Right when you roll your foot after placing it down, or maybe I in fact have a very odd walk, which causes those sounds to be released, I am not sure but I will continue to wear these shoes because they are spiffy.    Pet peeve #1: I hate it when cars try to speed up when they see me trying to pass them on the freeway ... what the hell? ... I have a theory on that though ... I think since they see a Dodge Spirit or a Chrysler Lebaron buzzing by and almost catching up to them, they feel like they need to start speeding up ... as if they cant be passed by a sedan... please ... Big mama burns rubber like no other ...  pet peeve #2: SUV drivers who don’t know how big their cars are ... and who cant drive them ... although, it is fun to watch a big ass expedition get stuck coming out of a parking lot ... it goes a li’l bit back then they try to turn the wheel and move forward then they move back a li’l bit then they try to turn the wheel and move forward - its a vicious, hilarious cycle ... always brings a li’l smile to my face ...  pet peeve #3: constant whiners ... I think I can leave it at that ... pet peeve #4: liars who lie about stupid stuff ...   "...a mitten-wearing, bird-flipping whiney-hiney" Mark this down as an incidental observation or life lesson, the unruly bastard child of the current Midwest deep freeze and the often-delicious, road rage-based urge to comment nonverbally on other people's grossly incompetent driving techniques:  You look really goofy trying to flip someone off while you're wearing mittens. It just doesn't produce the same aesthetic result, or message, as you'd get with a gloved or naked hand. I suppose there are gesture quality variances based on the weight or construction of the fabric, but with your garden-variety fleece or acrylic mitten, the traditional one-fingered salute pretty much looks to the object of your hostility as if you're just motoring along and seized by the sudden need to read your own palm like a mobile astrologer or something. And that, safety-conscious driver that you are, you're holding your hand up at eye level instead of studying it in your lap, so's you won't have to take both eyes off the road and away from random tasks such as not broadsiding a family of five in their minivan.  So. With that bit of erudition tucked safely under our thinking caps, let's move on to other current events and see what wisdom we can glean from them:  Ice cream: my downfall, my nemesis, my crutch  How do I stop binge-eating ice cream? I mean, do I avoid it like the plague? Do I downgrade to sherbet? Does anyone know how to change this kind of emotional eating pattern? It really sucks to know that I keep doing this, and so far, although I've lessened the frequency of said ice cream frenzies, they still happen with a vengeance from time to time. What the hell do I do? I don't want my sweet tooth to keep me from my goals. I want health. I just want chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, too. And Tillamook Marionberry pie ice cream. I've got to figure this out. I've just got to. I'm definitely having a hard go of it. Yesterday, as planned, I did get home, shop for some veggies and fruit, make some dinner (buckwheat pancakes with blueberries & eggs/salsa/beans/spinach scramble), and then settle in for my favorite shows. And finally, I got to bed at a reasonable hour. But still, I woke up feeling like hell, so I called in sick to work today and slept all morning--fitfully, but sleep is sleep, you know? I feel better now, although still kind of out of it. Sort of woozy and dizzy mixed with a stuffy nose. I'm just swimming in this sick, thick, sticky world right now, where everything feels hard and unbreathable and it's like my body is manifesting my emotions. Turmoil all around. And I just can't put my finger on it. Anyway, I ate like hell today (ice cream, how I loathe your allure) and paid for it with cramps (sorry, not delicate, but you know, that's life). My intestines hate me. I know this, and still, I ignore them. And then they unleash their wrath on me. Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is the grossest name ever for a fairly mundane and typical thing that afflicts a lot of people.  Why doesn’t that rule my life?   No ice cream does, it rules my eating life. I know my body is trying to tell me to lay off the ice cream and all things dairy, but do I listen? No, the cold, smooth stuff soothes me, especially when I'm feeling sick and binge-y. Somehow I'll get through this. I know I will. I'll figure it out. I've got to stop letting my emotions rule what I put in my mouth. I know I've been kind of nutzy feeling lately, and I know it will pass, but right now, it is awfully hard. And I will leave you all for my date with Ben and Jerry.  I have decided to take up a new sport, yeppers!  I am gonna take up extreme gay guy pouncing.  My first target… Fabi! *Beware!  Beware!* And here a poem for ya!  Lol, stay spiffy and foxy.  Much hearts and stars to Riley!  Star light, star bright I don’t know why I only see you at night. You are so tiny, yet so luminous, So near yet so far. Words speak not, When we're staring at the same bright star; Through telepathy we know  We're thinking of the same thing. We may be separated now, But only time will tell if they'll be together. And if Jack and Jill really fell down, or Humpty Dumpty falls of the wall; Soon they'll know their fate. Always together, never apart; That is their vow, Forever heart to heart.  Childish I know, but I am corney as a field, nigga'!

      Well, today is a day to remember and the celebrate a life that was, a relationship hidden by me, and a unfortunate incident hidden by me as well.  Today is a day to remember that one individuals love can drive them to dramatic actions.  Justin, I am sorry I failed you as a lover.  I am sorry you saw the world as unlivable.  I am truly sorry your grave will be unattended by me this year.    But today is also a day of jubilation and success on love’s front. On April 24th, a mere 47 days away, Riley Hays is going to Junior Prom with me, A.K.A Fabi.  Riley truly is an amazing boi.  Riley’s heart is one of gold.  He is a character that doesn’t judge or condemn or look down upon anyone.  Mrhahahah!  He is neat and shiny! And he is funny as frickin’ sin.  And some weird shit happened last night.  It all started with our ‘Good Byes’ two days ago: Fabi: Paint a picture of my face upon your pillow...and I shall of you...and we shall communicate with our pillows ...in hopes that we may see each other in our dreams tonite. I'll astral project my ass. lol.   Disco: Lol, I am sure we will, until tomorrow So then the creepy shit, I think is was the cool ass shit, like spiritual stuff.  Fate, signs?  Yall tell me!  Fabi: When I went to bed last night, there was some point when I felt feverish and rolled over.. and when I did..I saw your face on my pillow ...like, it was for a brief ten seconds.. well, actually I shook...like, my whole body shook because it was so miraculous. ...but I totally saw you.  Disco: I woke up and I have fuck me hair well I jumped out of bed at two in the morning and went to the bathroom to piss and I splashed water on my face and you were in my mirror,  no shitting, so like I grabbed my notebook and in the red nightlight glow I scratched out a poem FREAKY.  It is cool as Hell! Beatachh, this relationship is frickin’ awesome.com! Fabi is corny as sin, but hell so am I!  Fabi: Like, the universe just pointed its proverbial finger at us and said "Hey comet and asteroid, meet and mate?" Lol, well enough of that more will come later!   	 I don't know why people are so reluctant to really do something to change their lives. Of the people I have to talk to at school, they keep complaining that everything is hard and life is tough. But what are they doing to change that? Just keep coming back to school and basically take in all the crap they can for the day. But why do they do that anyway? It is pointless to complain. Americans are known to do that. Just a bunch of whiners! People should just grow up and learn to overcome adversities. Instead of waiting for what the government has to say about something. Nowadays, I'd like to think that I come onto school fully charged with positivist. I dismiss any negative things I say as bad habit. A bad habit that I need to kick really bad. Whining and complaining never does anything good, really. Why because all they do is prolong the feeling of dread.  But sharp tongue is allowed for asinine individuals.   One of the best thing I ever decided to do lately is put down what I think and feel to a medium such as this. Sure, people can come and visit my blog and have an opinion of their own. But tell me who doesn't? The truth is everyone has their own opinion on what something is. It is up to us to sift through everything and take in what’s realty useful and important. And of course, some level of tact is involved.  I have definitely discovered the joy of listening to other people talk. Hear what they have to say about something. Of course bad breathe not included. No matter how good and informative the conversation is, there is simply no good excuse for bad breathes. That includes BAD RANCID BREATHE.  I used to think that there was something to prove to somebody else about how much I have changed. I just wish the next schoolmate who meets me does not dismiss me. No one likes to be dismissed. Everyone wants to feel needed and noticed. To be recognized. I used to bear too much thought about what people used to know me as. I can never fully change. What I was before is still inside me. I never try too hard not to screw up because the more I try so hard, the more I tend to mess up. So I just take my time and look where I am going.  Recently I had to battle a comment made against me. It was the comment made about the quality of work. I admit upfront and rather not proudly that I tend to mess up at school. I was told that in the U.S. that if you screw up too much, you'd get punished.  And I used to let that get to me. I mean, REALLY get to me. Then I found out that ANY excuse that I made about myself pertaining to work was just playing down my situation. I think that on several occasions, if I did not seem to feel so sorry about screwing up something, I would have actually been out on my ass without a job.  But now. I REALLY take time to look at what I am doing. I still mess up. But not too bad. Maybe I have lost the respect of my Advisors. Even my officers and counselors But I survived. And I have learnt to move on.  Being positive about the outlook of my own life is just the tip of the iceberg. One has to really open up their eyes and take responsibility of their own lives to truly know the meaning of living. Of course you can take it easy and enjoy your life. But what use is that if you are completely broke?  Living is Winsconsin as a local gay man; the height is set too high. So much is expected of us. But not all of us can step up and meet the measurement. And I suggest no one try to compete against a striaght man. Comparing the 2 is simply unfair. Anyway, why do you have to feel the need to defend your own honor against that kind of prejudice? So she has a woman lover? Who gives cow? But that's the whole point. Some of these people seem to make it as if it does matter. That the straight man is the answer. The fault, if there is any, is not on the straight. Of course, don't take this as a generalized statement. I don't mean everyone of course. Think about it.

      So, Fabi has a name!  *grasps* His name is Riley Paul-Patrick Hays and rearranged it yeilds happily racial turkeys. (anagrams peeps anagrams, you know rearrange the letters…) (i.e: William Joseph Kraft is makeshift pillowjar) A turkey and a pillow jar… *shuggs* Damn you know we are odd. And, btw you are so not fat!  I swear these gay men and “I am so fat” thing.  Boi, please I weigh 3 pounds more then you and I’m a mere 6/7ths of a inch taller then you!  A question of the origin of banana, that is, the word banana. That would be the etymology of banana, right? Just wondering if that person had their mouth stuffed with them and someone asked "What are you eating?"  [Snakes] 	An old tale my grandfather told to my stepmother when she was younger.  My grandfather was an uneducated man that learned hard life lessons because he had to.  Although never graduated from high school, he has knowledge beyond all realms of reality. While he was alive, I barely knew him, but he is in fact a man that I greatly admire.  He was a man that deserves recognition.  Life is education, not necessarily school.  Not to say that schooling isn’t important but life itself can teach you amazing lessons.  So, here is his theory: 	Three snakes are crossing the road.  Along comes a truck and runs over one of those snakes.  Now one snake is going to stay behind and the other will finish crossing the road.  What one of them are you?  If you are the one to stay behind, you may have a heart but you are sidetracked way too easily.  The other snake that finished crossing the road may have looked over his shoulder, but they know that they have a purpose and they know that they need to conitue on.  Neither one of them is bad, it makes you think don’t it?  What what one are you?  *trumpets blare*  Every evening, pastels of twilight slowly glow Awaking dreaming, spots of stars begin to show   All alone the drive was long He was singing with the sound  While finishing his favorite song  He pulled slowly into town  The seminar would start at five According to the invitation Before checking in he would drive And try to find the right location  In the darkened square at night Offices and shops were closed  But beyond there was a light  Glowing treetops were exposed  Blue then green the aura changed The driver’s eyes were opened wide A farmer’s field seemed rearranged He pulled up slowly along its side  “Quick now, men, ease it down There’s a car quite near the field Someone might just hear the sound My hope is we won’t be revealed.  Put her down beyond the shed They might see our engine’s shield A few more minutes here, instead All evidence must be concealed.”  Forcing the phone between his knees The governor’s aide let out a sigh Fifteen calls in thirteen days Regarding something in the sky  At a peaceful, placid lake Ducks were bobbing, half awake Exploding suddenly to sky Squawking, screeching, flying high  Believers in their cozy rooms Never thinking thoughts not given Without a thought, never assume  From sofas, movies and easy living  Florescent midnight basement light Assembly rooms, white coats and tools Circuit boards and miles of wires Naïve, unsuspecting fools  “That ignoramus Einstein fool A century of unquestioned laws Science built on information Gathered from equipment flaws   And here we wait within this field If discovered, you know the plans By your oath you are duty bound Our craft not pass to other’s hands.”  The businessman was filled with awe Weaving among the stiff corn stalks Recalling the strange light he saw The aura gone, but still he walks  “Call the base, he’s getting close Tell them that we might be seen We’re ready for the Exit Process Self destruction with auto-clean.”  Screaming tires down Highway nine A large truck pulls into a lane  Lights ablaze, siren wailing Farmer Jones says, “How insane!”  “Out, sir, now!” the bullhorn blares “Environmental Problem Team!” The businessman jumps out and stares Uniformed staff swarm the scene  “Leave the work to our patrol, Mr. Jones, go back to sleep The situation is in control We’re gathering data we must keep.”  The hotel bed comforts his thoughts Of living now among the norm The water parts, the crew returns Recalling fearful oaths they’ve sworn  Every dawn, twinkles of mist amongst the dew Awake the dreaming, a lovely scene observed by few

      You have nonlinear water fowl issues, as do I so if you are offended go chase your ducks!  It's not always nice to start your day with destructive thoughts, feelings of conceit, vainess and bitterness. And of thoughts of weakness. I feel weak.  But, I've got an essay to pass in, chapters to read, and work to go to tonight. I like to hide behind these, although they are a priority, my sanctuary.  Fucking hell, I need to get over myself. I like my coffee bitter, bitter, bitter coffee. Anyways, just having a rough day. Ever wonder whether or not you should feel guilty about something? Doesn't it rip you apart? Doesn't the easy route seem to be to accept your bitchy, ill-disposed, malignant traits rather than try to justify the right and the good? Accepting your faults is a warm blanket. It makes things feel okay sometimes. But is it right or is it wrong? Again--anyways. Drink your fucking coffee, bitch. It's time to move on. Just like aspiring to win the endless war. I'm sitting here, drinking my bitter bitter coffee, being a bitter bitter person. Time to move on, you crazy bitch. I have a theory. My theory, though some of you may think I'm stating the obvious, is that a human governing system is only as good as the people in it. What I mean by this is that creating an ideal government, or an ideal self-governing system will not guarantee that no tyranny or injustice will take place. It seems to me that you can create a government that encourages injustice in a society, or one that encourages justice. And perhaps that's really the most you can do.  Let me put it this way, if you were to penalize just actions in a society and reward injustice, you could very well guarantee (and I would site human history to support this assertion) that some people would act immorally. For example let's say your government outlawed dissent in your society, and rewarded those who turned in dissenters. Some people would turn in their friends and neighbors to the government for prosecution, precisely because they would be rewarded for doing so or potentially because it would keep the government at least temporarily from coming after them. Thus by persecuting those who act justly or morally, and rewarding those who do not you would remove from society all those capable of redeeming it. The converse I believe would not necessarily work the same way.  It is possible to create a system of government/self-government that rewards just actions and discourages and/or punishes injustice. I do not believe this would guarantee nor do I believe that you could guarantee that some people would act morally. While it may be likely that some would there would be no way of guaranteeing this outcome. My point is this, you can create an immoral society through government, but you can't create a moral one. Thus creating a self-governing system that should work, will not guarantee that it will work. Why? Because to some degree how well our justice system works is contingent on the rationality of those involved. More precisely since the survival and prosperity of an economy and thus the societies that make it up is contingent on rational action, the success of any justice system that was regulated by the marketplace would be contingent on the rationality of the society that patrons it.  To clear a few things up a bit, since my thoughts seem a little disparate even to me. I am considering all unjust actions to be immoral, and all just actions to be moral. However the terms justice and morality are not interchangeable. On a personal level morality goes far beyond the scope of justice. It has to do with your personal values, and can change from person to person. Justice requires at least two people to exist, and in fact makes it possible for those individuals to coexist in the same society. It pertains explicitly to those rights that must be necessarily protected for a society to exist. For example I can't coexist in a society with those who would choose to murder me. I may for a while if I were ignorant of those who wanted to destroy me, but my destruction would ultimately put a crimp in my plan for continued existence. Finally I am functioning on the presumption that moral action requires rational thought. Thus a million irrational tyrants placed into a market-regulated justice system that was designed to preserve justice, and punish injustice, presuming no others were placed into the same system, would necessarily fail. After all some of those irrational tyrants still have to serve as judge and jury, and though they may be rewarded for acting justly those who insured that the system continued to function as it was designed to would also be irrational tyrants. There's no getting around it. Our systems of justice and governance are dependent on us.   The point of creating a self-governing justice system can never be to create a more moral society, but to keep the government from destroying and/or damaging the morality of the society it governs. I point this out because I think it is important to remember that while we should work to create a better governing system, it will never be a cure for all of our social ills. And that a system that should work, could still fail in spite of our best intentions and efforts.  I am a little down today, so poems are necessary for if you notice I write them when I am really happy or really crappy, lol that rhymes.  So here is some poetry!  Cries that no one hears Tears that pierce the skin Thoughts so cold, warmth is no where Wishes of nonexistence Fears, hopes, and dreams No one knows of Screams on the inside Cries on the outside A wish that could be so easily fulfilled But fear consumes these wishes Drowned with sympathy Such terrible empathy is never felt Screams indulged in silver Released in such hatred and despise Everything's fixed the same way No matter how hard he tries  He needs this to survive He pretends everything’s okay But he's such a horrible actor he deserves no Oscar For he’s failed once again And maybe this time he'll fade away Fade away into nothing  A person compiled of glass A person who shatters ever so freely Composed of beautiful notes But a song no one would ever hear Silent screams Endless nights Fits of rage That end in cries A soul made of liquid A person made of glass Such a horrific combination Yet no one attempts to fix it A partnership so fatal But no one realizes it  Until it’s too late

      I talked to this really fabi guy on the net last night.  He was a interesting fellow, very much so.  Well, Brett had to take sure of his mother last night it was really quite sweet of him.  He is such a doll!  I find the new  urlLink nickel  offensive somehow and, despite some Native American ancestors, my heritage is not Native American. If you haven't seen the images, the new nickel celebrates the Louisiana Purchase. The back image has two hands shaking in peaceful agreement; one of the hands represents the US government and the other symbolizes Native Americans.

        So, I have decided to name my body pillow Brett.  Why do you ask?  Well, I spend all of my sleeping time holding that pillow, so I figure if I can’t have him here, I will have my own thoughts about such event occurring.  And, btw I don’t and won’t rape pillows!  I am so pleased right now.     [Smoke me on though] After the national budget speech was made last week, a hard pack of 20 cigarettes costs another dollar more. Now, a Marlboro hard pack costs $3.50. (If you're frugal, this amount can cover lunch and dinner for 2 days and you might even have some money left over for a packet of mints.) My chain-smoking friend kindly informed me this after he had bought his daily bread. He also informed me that the taxes he pays for his ciggies practically put me through school. For those who don't know, all local students in state colleges receive tuition grants from the government well worth over $5,000 each. According to Stephie, who did an internship at British-American Tobacco Company last year, for every hard pack which costs about $3 plus (before the budget speech), $2 goes to the government. Now after the $1 increment, an average smoker who consumes 20 cigarettes a day pays at least $1000 more taxes annually than an average non-smoker. Fiscally, smokers on average contribute more to society than non-smokers. Not just taxes, you know. It has been found that most people caught littering in some states are smokers littering with their cigarette butts. Such offenders are also fined, I think, $100, yet another contribution to our national revenue. Moreover, smokers understand how increasing health costs, an aging population and falling fertility rates can be a weary burden on a nation's economy and government. By chain-smoking, smokers are sacrificing their healths, so that our future generations will be less burdened with caring for our grey population. Their social consciousness does not stop there. Since us non-smokers are so selfishly and hedonistically leading a longer and healthier life, and subsequently eating into the national budget, they try to kill us off with their secondhand smoke as well. So I asked my chain-smoking friend how I can repay him for smoking me through school, he simply selflessly says: " Just buy me cigarettes, just buy me cigarettes..."    Woohoo!  Gay Marriages in five states, six if you’re a lesbian: Oregan, New York, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and in San Francisco!  Lol, what now bitch?    So some boi e-mailed me about my site and it reads:   Will, I'm sure that you won't address my following questions because my take on your blog is that it is simply a forum to talk about things and not strive to honor God through the things you talk about.. However, I am very interested to know why you claim to carry the name of Christ but do not desire to talk in such a way that brings honor to His name? Side note: I find it very hard to believe that Jesus used any of the words that you use (i.e. s**t, hell, etc). Believe it or not, Jesus came to save us from hell and he would not be near as loose about throwing around that term as you seem to be. I do not mean any disrespect by these comments-- however, I firmly believe that it is time for you to reflect upon God's holiness and then you can teach people what you believe to be the truth concerning the Emerging culture. There is no doubt in my mind that God is not glorified by many of your statements. Maybe the fact is that your freedom is more important than your obedience!!!!   And in response I worte:   Jeff,  It is quite obvious to me that you are the one God has put on the earth to surf blogs and insure that His Holiness is preserved. At the same time I can’t help but note your tone, I think you are suppressing some feelings; I would encourage you to prayerfully consider your sexuality.  The rhythm of your words and the tone of your sentence structure leads me to believe you are fighting the urge to be attracted to people of your same sex. Please understand that I say this all with conviction in my heart and your best interest in my mind. May God Heal you of your suppressed homosexuality before it’s to late.  Forbid the day you fell in love with a man, and if that day never shall come then so be it.  Do understand that your concern for follow man is dearly noted, nut think about the message you are conveying.  God taught us to love all people and your actions are misplaced.

      I’m stepping out of my friend's life. Who is she? She used to be my girl 3 yrs ago. It was destined that we should never be nice to one another. It was boredom that brought us together and there was just this layer consist of a thick sense of transparency in between us. Neither can tolerate each other's way of thinking and neither can touch each other's life. We were so close in personality; too close. The friendship between me and her was so wholeheartedly treasured and so fearlessly fought. It was a mistake… a mistake I made by loving her so unbearingly and missing Lauren unintentionally... Her arrogance eagerly digested love and concern into simpler, breakable particles, where they gently dissolved and finally be eliminated… All I could have done for her, I tried and I failed. I believe the journey we were destined to walk together had come to an end. I don't need her footprints in my heart anymore… for I was given a brand new path to walk...  and together with Brett I will take this path! (BTW Brett is my new boi, he is great and all shiny!)  [Taking it in, try to be feminine]  My experience with casual dating truly boggles me. The fact being that somehow I am INCAPABLE of it. Add 1/3 honesty, 1/3 fear, and 1/3 bad timing and there you have it. It being me. Because I have no idea if it is pheromones or that unexplainable confidence, or a certain smell like someone else has been circling this territory - but I have been father fucking irresistible this past couple of weeks. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about that part. No, in fact, I like that part a great deal. It is the fact that I am now left with envy for those people who can string along many people at once with no fear, and no thought of the others' feelings. I'm pissed now. I'm not talking about this anymore.  I am talking about this: I have it on good authority I'm about to be fired. Well, hot diggety damn! Why, you ask? Because I attend school in a building that is beyond unprofessional with their inner politics. It borders on the appearance of poop-throwing monkeys, if you ask me. It's just dumb stuff about someone needing to go down for something, and them picking me because THEY probably have it on good authority that I've been searching for a new learning anyway. So there. I'm not too worried about it.   I have no wisdom for you today. Are you mad? Sorry.  There I go. Dancing. That's beautiful, simply. I never really danced as much as this past fall. We go out to parties and we don't waste that time anymore. We don't just sit there. We don't just stand there. We dance. Dress up. Moving the legs to connect with the ground. Hands to touch the air. Shaking hips, shrugging shoulders. Touching other legs, slipping arms around waists, sexual electric energy, young, smiling, sticky sweet sweat, open facial expressions, important.   And that's what I guess I've learned the most about it. It's important, extremely, to dance. It's important to wake up and be sore in the stomach, the groin, the thighs, the triceps, face hurting from smiling. Going out and dancing teaches me about music, about the other people in the room, about all these tiny muscles in my body that make me so alive. These things are probably the most important thing, the most important metaphor for college here, or youth, or life, or whatever that I learned this past fall. And I'm so glad.  "Open your eyes, spectacular's right in front of you"

      Shave the hair off the back and butt of an 85-year-old man with a straight-edge razor  -OR- clip the yellow, brittle toenails of his 80-year-old wife?   Okay this one is very sick. But I'll take the old lady and her crappy old toenails. Not at all what I would like to do. But I think that goes without saying.   NEWSFLASH: Charlize Theron got BEST ACTRESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She is soooo awesome!  I mean seriously!     So I went to Illinois to visit family and decided to see The Passion of the Christ and there was this really hott boi that was working there, and so gay.  And anyways I liked him, and during the film I had to pee so off to the restroom walking past the boi.  While urinating their conversation is echoing into the bathroom about how I am cute and he should try for me and he brought it all to close with this comment:  “Yes he is sexy but he is a Southerner” So of course, like a Mondo fag, I start getting teary at the movies, and it wasn’t because of the film, not because I wish he was still here or that I wish I was else where, but because it further confirms the fear that made this weekend mildly crappy.  But then there are thoughts of Brent, ohh Brett.  He is really neat and spiffy and yeah!  I am the HAPPIEST boi in My world right now. Notice how I said MY world and not the world. Cause the world is a Hugemungous place and I'm sure that somewhere in it someone is happier than I am. For example, someone could have just given birth, or been told that they are in remission from cancer. You get the point.  And i will say it is life and Brent might be helping it as well...  Back to my happiness.     FRIEND OF THE TRUEST KIND A friend… Is someone who keeps your secrets and never divulges them, even if tortured--or worse, tempted with chocolate. Is someone who quietly destroys the photograph that makes you look like a beached whale. Is someone who knows you don't know what you're talking about, but allows you to reach that conclusion on your own. Is someone who goes with you on a diet--and off it too Is someone who doesn't say, "I told you so," no matter how tempting it might be. A friend of the truest kind is kind and true to you  [Zombies are eating my brains]  I have this absolutely inescapable fear of zombies, body-snatchers and the like. But I also have this absolutely inescapable masochism that forces me to watch movies about these phenomena, followed by not sleeping or functioning for two-three weeks. Anyway, I watched 28 Days later, which isn't really even that great (but the naked man was nice) but that doesn't stop me from being so scared I can barely go to my radio show (Random Radio w/DJ de Sade - 99.1 FM). During my sleepless nights staring at my bedroom door I came up with a theory. If ever zombies or something like them took over the world, I would be one of the last non-zombies alive. It's because of the way I play Dodgeball. Allow me to explain. Stay with me here. When I play dodgeball I stand in back and let everyone else get out until I am forced into the fight in lieu of no other team members. At this point lighting will strike (because I have all the balls on my side) (no pun) and I will lob a ball over to someone who isn't paying attention because they don't think I'm worthy of it, and they will get out. This will bring one of my team members back, etc.  Applying this theory to human destruction by zombies, I would just be hiding somewhere. I may not be a good fighter, or lucky, or even a minority - but I would be in the movie because I am a GD scaredy-cat. DO NOT underestimate my ability to sit completely still in one place with my eyes wide open for hours upon hours, perhaps even days. One snag in my plan is that I wouldn't be able to abandon my family and friends, but anyone who decided to stick with me and act like a rabbit who freezes in front of a predator would survive too. Eventually I would come out of hiding and one of three things would happen: 1.) I would find that one badass who survived by weaponry and skill, and they would take care of me because they were in need of human contact and/or sex. 2.) Lightning would strike and the zombies (or zombie-like creatures) would be outsmarted by some random shit that only I would do in that type of situation (perhaps pretending I was a zombie, too, or something equally absurd) and I would find that goddamn laboratory or wherever safety is... or (most likely) 3.) Die immediately, just slightly later than everyone else. I don't know if my theories are true, and hopefully I would never have to prove them, but I have a feeling I would survive due to my ability to wait shit out while holding my breath and slowly giving myself a heart attack.  Besides, the zombies wouldn't bother with me anyway, just like the kids in dodgeball. I'd probably just sneak by the peripheral-zombie vision and grab an explosive - "Hey, guys? What's this?" Those suckers will never see me coming.

      Lil’ note for Riley I wanna kiss you  Every minute,  Every hour, Every day! -The Darkness, I Believe in a Thing Called Love  It's funny, that this one short life we're given is often compromised because we can only select one option from among many. On the other hand, there are a few of us who had - in some respects - no option whatsoever, and we've paid for it all our lives.  Somewhere along the way we discover that, even though there were once factors beyond our control, we can exercise a form of personal manifest destiny. Territory that was once claimed by others can be repossessed and restyled as our own, despite lacking the purity of first effort. Perhaps it is just as well. Speaking only for myself, I'm not sure I would have traded any of those choiceless instances; they made me who I am. And even though it's taken most of my 16 years to realize it, who I am the best gift I have to give.  ACTS AND ALL THAT JAZZ!-  I got my ACTS back from the corporate education machine that we have to cater to!-  Okay, overall I got a 23, which ain’t too shabby.  But inside it is my Verbal section I scored a 25, with a 98th percentile in rhetoric.  And a 24 in mathematics and with a 91st percentile in Plane Geometry/Trigonometry!  I take my SATS this weekend!   Batters up! Ehvoy! Ah, baseball.  I love pissing away a day (or evening) at the ballpark, watching the duel between pitcher and hitter, outfielder and baserunner, listening to the crack of the bat....  Frankly, there was a time when I couldn't stand to watch the game, before I played softball and knew the rules and a bit of strategy.  Watching a game makes me think of fishing:  both require an enormous amount of patience to sit through long periods of relative inactivity, but the payoff is often exhilirating.  One of the best parts of a game is people-watching.  There's all kinds at a game, and between innings the camera operators pan the crowd to transmit larger-than-life images via the Diamond Vision screen ... a sort of focused voyuerism.  And, in an odd way, it's a time to feel a part of a community, sitting amongst 50,000 people who -- for nine innings, anyway -- all have something in common.    Oops, my bad.  What was I thinking?  Suddenly, between the fourth and fifth innings, the illusion is abruptly shattered ... the Diamond Vision has become The Kiss-Cam.  Yep, those 20-foot x 20-foot, gazillion-pixel images of heterosexual couples kissing, while being egged on by the hoots and hollers of [nearly] everyone else in the stadium, magnify every queer's role as a second-class human being in a way nothing else can.  Anyone interested in buying season tickets?  Top Ten Rants about Vacation  10. Apparently Florida is a no turn signal state. Unfortunately lots of senior's instead of having theirs professionally removed, break it off leaving it in left turn mode. 9. Florida also has the no smoking ban inside restaurants which I've ranted about before. Several establishments had their smoking "corral" outside of the entrance, where everyone had to cross through a cloud of smoke to get in, instead of sitting in a different section. 8. For the thousandth time, I don't want to buy a timeshare, even if you are offering me cheaper Disney tickets. 7. I-95 is EVIL as in Eastern Vacation Interstate Line. Average speed - 30 mph. 6. Yes, I know it's not even noon. Bring the damned wine list. 5. Kids over five shouldn't be in strollers.......or with pacifiers sticking out of their bratty mouths - if it would keep them quiet, maybe. 4. Mothers shouldn't steer strollers like it's a ride. You don't have to hurl your kid through the crowd to get in line faster (I feel a personal injury lawsuit or two pending - three strollers ran into me and one elderly lady in a motorized cart). 3. Hasn't anyone near Disney heard of an internet cafe? 2. There are more mechanical animals and cartoon characters at Animal Kingdom than there are real animals. and, 1. No cartoon characters groped me (though the elderly woman who ran into me kept trying to).

       Fear:  "Let's have a war"  "Let's have a war! we could all use the bread! ...let's have a war! jack up the dow jones! ...let's have a war! sell the rights to the networks! "     Open letter to the Massachusetts Legislature:   Don't you find it just the tiniest bit ironic that the Puritans, who were fleeing religious tyranny in England, landed upon your shores nearly 400 years ago -- and by voting today to amend the State's constitution to ban gay marriage, you have endorsed precisely the persecution the Puritans were escaping?   Aohvay!  What is next?   Identity theft is all the rage these days. “Keep or destroy your receipts,” “Beware of camera phones when standing in the grocery checkout line with your credit card.” Billions of dollars are lost every year to identity thieves who gain access to an individual’s social security number and date of birth, open a few fraudulent credit accounts, then go on freewheeling Internet shopping sprees. But as damaging as financial identity theft is there is another, more insidious form those strips one of their identity entirely, not to be rediscovered for years. And other forms cause harm that isn’t apparent for a generation or more. An example of the former is mental, physical or sexual abuse: endured as a child, the psyche defends itself by shutting down everything not absolutely essential to basic survival. And the mechanisms that block the hurt also shut out … everything else. The ultimate cost is calculated in the years spent in vain attempts to recover what was irretrievably lost, all the while losing out on opportunities for lack of knowing how to handle them and losing friends because they never understood. Te theft of identity that evades discovery for generations is just as costly. In late 1941, my friend’s grandparents were living in Stockton, California; her maternal grandparents were in Los Angeles. They and their families were among the 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were forced to leave behind their homes, businesses and lives for uncertain futures in internment camps surrounded by barbed wire. The majority of evacuees were second-generation (Nisei), most in their late 20s or early 30s with young children. Their parents, being the first generation (Issei) in the country, spoke little or no English and relied on their children to explain why everything they had worked for was suddenly gone. The end of the war saw their release from the internment camps but not from the prevailing anti-Japanese sentiment. Some Issei elected to return to Japan, and many Nisei renounced their U.S. citizenship to join their parents; and many more renounced Japanese culture altogether, refusing to speak the language or hand down the traditions, even refusing to give as yet unborn children Japanese names.    Apples In Stereo:  "The rainbow"   "...so when you look at me I wonder who you see and who I am to you..."      An interesting thing about falling within three distinct demographic categories - gay, White and male - is that each category has unique proscriptions which preclude acceptance of the others. Hence, being gay means being distrusted by straight males; being White means being rejected by your own race because you're gay; and being a male who is femme not butch pretty well eliminates acceptance by everyone. But then, I've spent my entire life trying to fit in somewhere. Fitting in with my family of origin was impossible because of childhood mental and physical abuse. Eventually, the learned distrust interfered with healthy interactions with people outside the home; that is to say, I was so fearful of anyone outside the home "finding out" that I became painfully withdrawn around others. But it comes out as being standoffish, so that no one really knows how to take me. I suppose I've gotten better about fitting in, but it still takes a long time for people to get to know me. And then there's that thing about one group shutting out the other. Why is it so hard for people to just accept others, to realize that every one of us has a story worth telling and none of us is better than our neighbor? A local alternative newspaper recently published a column about lesbians who do visual evaluations of each other, taking stock of a person's potential worthiness based upon what their appearance conveys. (The only reason the columnist wrote of the subject is that she was subjected to it herself ... and isn't it true that one doesn't fully understand another's situation until they've experienced it, too?) But, I honestly can say that I haven't experienced racism, classism and sexism from others to the degree I have from homosexuals. It's sad when you aren't even accepted in your own subculture(s).

      The Spinanes: "Greetings from the sugarlick" "all your bad plays and morning after days don't mean a thing to this hair of the dog crowd..."   Is suicide a behavior unique to the human species?   I ask because the other day I was making coffee and noticed ants marching around the sink.  There weren't a lot, three or four at most, and they seemed to be absent a particular purpose or destination - and then I noticed one ant that was ass up (or ass down - who can tell?) on the counter next to the dish rack.  Really.  It was kinda freaky to see him like that. I began to imagine what led up to that.  Maybe he was creeping along the window ledge, intensely engaged in the perpetual hunt for food (of which there was none) when, suddenly, faced with the prospect of going home with an empty mandible, he gave up hope and took a header, bonking on the counter.  Not that I'm an advocate of ants - or anything with six or more legs.  But it does makes you wonder, no?   Okay, I've held my tongue long enough.   Someone needs to explain for me a sound and logical argument supporting same-sex marriage, preferably someone who is unswayed by political affiliation or gender orientation.  Thus far, not one of my queer friends has deviated from the assertion that attaining the right to marry their same-sex partner is tantamount to achieving equality with the greater (heterosexual) population.  However, it does prove that my friends may as well be sheep.   Advocates of same-sex marriage say that married people have the benefit of certain rights.  For instance, married people have the right to survivors' benefits, the right to visit their spouse in a hospital (whatever type that might be included), the right to adopt children, the right to inherit, and the right to make medical decisions.  But wait!  Where on the marriage certificate are such rights enumerated?  Oh, I see ... the rights we speak of were born of policies created by institutions seeking to draw distinctions between those who are married and those who aren't.  In other words, policies of societal control.  For those of you who don't remember (or weren't listening) in their Sociology classes, how about a refresher?  These United States were founded by a landed gentry that employed marriage as a means of obtaining property, and restricted the institution of marriage to members of their own class (the laws of the time also classified women as property).  In fact, women were unable to hold property or cash assets in their own name, were expected to give up their maiden name upon marriage, and still don't earn the standard of wages that men do.   There is no historical proof that the institution of marriage was created to permit an equalization of any sort -- not among the marriage partners, and certainly not between the sexes.  Which raises a critical question:  So long as inequality remains among the greater heterosexual population, where in the larger picture does the argument of achieving equality for gays and lesbians fit?   The "rights" sought by proponents of same-sex marriage -- inheritance, property, adoption, etc. -- weren't created when marriage was.  It seems to me that the better fight would be changing the policies that were created as afterthoughts to marriage, rather than blindly (and sheepishly) endorsing a patently non-egalitarian social control measure.   SCOOTERS!   Gorgeous weather today ... think I'll take my scooter for a ride. If you've never ridden a scooter, it's an experience I recommend highly; a buddy took me for a ride on hers last summer, and I've been hooked since. Unfortunately, there still aren't many riders in this area, even though we have 300 days of sun on average per year. But my buddy still managed to put together a small group that regularly gets together in the summer to ride in a gaggle - and we must be a sight to see! The best part of owning a scooter? Parking wherever I want to, rolling right up the sidewalk to the establishment's front door. And a fill-up only costs $1.75....

      This is the  DAY OF SILENCE !  So, a faggy article is needed… What's in a word? Dyke ... Fag ... Homo ... Queer. Sticks and stones may break my bones, blah, blah, etc. One of my work pals told me she discovered that she isn't as straight as she thought. After looking up the word "queer," she determined that it really did suit her. I now consider myself in good company. Way to go, Whew! When I sat down to think of a catchy name for this blog (mind you I have not one creative molecule in my body), I couldn't shake the concept of zen as it relates to the transition in achieving one's potential. Then the notion of queerness arose and I thought, "Shazam! A perfect example of lifelong transition!" (One never stops "coming out.") You see, there's been a controversy in the gay community for decades, centering on the notion of deliberately referring to ourselves as dykes, fags and queers. As the argument went, reclaiming those terms would eventually remove the concomitant stigma when said terms were flung by detractors. Well, I've never understood how [what amounts to be] self-deprecation could dull the razor-sharp pain of being called something that dictionaries categorize as derogatory slang.  However, popular notions of what it means to be queer have flexed with time. In the U.S., "queer" in the 30s or 40s meant "odd" or "strange." It only recently became synonymous with homosexuality and, because of that association, I always shied away from using it. On the other hand, there is NO ambiguity about "dyke" or "fag." [Remember grade school?] My journey then, is ... Queerly Zen. and even if I weren't a gay, I'd still call myself queer.   [w]ri[t]ers on the storm-   I was standing between the highway and the ocean in light rain, with puddles and rainbows all over the asphalt. Elbows on the metal guard-rail and students all over the scene. I close my eyes and I'm so close to the ocean that I can hear it but I open my eyes up and it's just the endless stream of traffic. I open my eyes up and instead of surf hitting sand it's rubber slapping puddles. Manufactured metal bodies speed by and they never once wander from their trajectories, like bullets set to flight. They roar, grandiose like nature, and we don't hear the ocean anymore, just commuters. Some lady who looked yellow all over who gets on the bus on the Bedford highway, who makes a silent fuss and blocks everyone's routine. Some boy with thick black dreads for hair and dressed all in blue looks sullen and blank, looks perfect for a bus stranger. Yellow blocks blue and sets his head spinning with brown buildings and intersections. Yellow gets off a minute later, chomping gum like she's trying to graw on the air. Blue mumbles and figures it all out and when he gets off the bus he runs across the street to try it all over again.

Easter eggs are hidden better than Iraq's WMD's. 8. There's a big painted X on your front door - in several pastel colors. 7. You find your cat hanging from the front porch by plastic green grass (this would be a bad thing?). 6. Instead of chocolate Easter bunnies, you get chocolate people. 5. The ears have been bitten off. 4. Instead of hip hopping down the bunny trail, he hip hops really loud rap music at 4 AM. 3. Your Easter eggs are colored with sayings not appropriate for Howard Stern. 2. You're left with the DVD of Monthy Python and the Holy Grail and a post it note saying "you're next." 1. Your Sunday paper smells suspiciously like rabbit urine.   BACK TO THE LIST! 9. Really pissed the IRS off and is still recovering from the audit. 8. After one too many negative posts about the FDA, the black helicopters arrived, shot me full of drugs, and erased my memory - who's Blog is this and why am I typing here? 7. Week of solitary debauchery killing many, many brain cells left me wondering "Who's Blog is this and why would I type here?" 6. Still stuck in the Orange Barrel Black Hole of I-95. Send alcohol.  5. Arrested for groping a Disney character and just now got bailed out (hey, turnabout is fair play). 4. Finally moved to Montana to protest taxes and join a militia, but got so bored after a week, I came back. 3. Computer was attacked by new, deadly Gael Berner virus, and instead of cleaning it, I just kept re-opening the email again and again. 2. Knew I shouldn't have smoked that Easter grass. 1. Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Scalia needed a fourth for a golf outing.

        Strange Day    I found the note I wrote myself about Cheetos. I was going to put it in, but it's pretty much what I posted yesterday. Well, there is this part I didn't add yesterday about how when we're kids we want to do fun things that are bad like lighting matches.  Have you ever had a crush? And I’m not talking about a lusty, wonton yearning to devour someone in a sweaty heart pounding physical entrée.  I mean something innocent, yet MORE than that. Have you ever been drawn to someone you don’t know? You may know OF them, maybe their name, where they work, or who some of their friends are - but you don’t know them. Yet something burns inside of you, but not a fierce burn, more like a steady pull welling up inside. You know that feeling – when you’ve done something really nice and rewarding, and you take a moment, a deep breath, a long satisfied breath – exhaling, and you feel IT, this relaxing, comforting, happy energy, flowing from your centre / your heart through your entire body, all the way out to your toes and fingertips. Well, that’s the feeling that overwhelms you the moment your gaze settles upon them.  You’re entranced.  Every time you physically see them, or hear them time stops. You’re heart, captivated, neglects its duty and misses a beat.  You forget to take in breath, being mesmerized by their presence, but you don’t even notice. Have you ever had a crush?  Has your vision of this object of your desire grown in time? Have you imagined, have you dreamt of how perfect they COULD be? Have you ever contemplated what would make someone the perfect compliment to who you are? Someone who was everything you ever wished for? Have you ever let your innocent crush be corrupted by this dream of perfection? Have you ever had a chance to meet the object of your crush? If you had let your crush smolder for years & years, nearly half a decade, corrupted by your selfish dreams of perfection, would you dare meet the object of your crush? Would you believe that there could be ANY chance whatsoever that this object of your crush could live up to these considerable expectations? Would you welcome the chance to cure yourself of this simmering yearning and this growing dream of perfection incarnated, or would you fear disappointment in the discovery that the dream is nothing more than that – a dream? Would you think killing the dream is better than forever living with this unfulfilled desire? Have you ever been self-doubting? Have you ever really looked deep within yourself & accepted who you feel you are – all limitations, flaws & fears included? Have you ever looked at yourself… …and then looked at someone else, someone special, and realized that they deserve so much more than you? Have you ever thought that, even though they are perfect – they are everything you could possibly want – there is no possible way that you could be the perfect compliment to them – that you are not perfect for them?  Do you think that you are exceptional? I do. Of course, I’m an egotistical, pompous ass.  I am a yellow-orange, rectangle-shaped cheese. I am very popular. Ihave lots of zip and energy and love to jump around. I am sharp and clever, but also sometimes a little stubborn. The most widely purchased and eaten cheese in the world. Cheddar cheeses were originally made in England, however today they are manufactured in many countries all over the world. Fully cured Cheddar is a hard, natural cheese. It is shaped like a drum, 15 inches in diameter, with natural rind bound in cloth. Normally, the color of Cheddar ranges from white to pale yellow. Some Cheddars, however, have a color added, giving the cheese a yellow-orange color. Cheddar is always made from cow's milk and has a slightly crumbly texture if properly cured. If the cheese is too young, the texture is smooth. Cheddar gets a sharper taste the longer it matures. It is generally matured between 9 and 24 months. The important thing in purchasing Cheddar, is to consider the age of the cheese. Milk is heated to 86 degrees F and inoculated with a lactic starter culture. After an hour rennet is added. When the curd is firm, it is ground down to marble-sized bits which are heated to 100 degrees F. The whey is discarded and it is sliced into slabs. The curd is pressed overnight and stands for 4 days in a cool atmosphere. Unlike other well known cheeses, Cheddar's name is not protected so it has been used and abused by many producers around the world. [ Country: England || Milk: cow milk || Texture: semi-hard ]

       Feline attention  As my cat bathed me last Sunday, I began to wonder why I could not have been born a feline—then I realized that I had asked myself a silly question. Obviously two human beings were incapable of spawning a cat, and I immediately awarded myself a slap on the wrist for thinking something so impractical. I had rested my head onto his little cat stomach that afternoon, and before I knew it he had begun licking my face, or “bathing” me. The texture of his tongue was a bit awkward, but this mild discomfort was not enough for me to pull away—he had graciously accepted me into his own feline culture, and I was not about to decline solely because his tongue felt somewhat like wet sandpaper being chafed against my forehead. That would be highly discourteous of me. So I allowed him to continue and began thinking about how simple life would be had I somehow been born a cat. Mainly I imagined a life fulfilled with numerous feline-escapades and countless hours spent sleeping. Those two features alone were enough for me to desire the feline high-life. It sounded beautiful—almost too good to be true. The only real drawback that I could think of in living the life of a cat would be the cuisine. To my deepest despair, kibbles and water would undeniably fail to tickle my fancy. For me, happiness would be difficult to find in a life without sandwiches and coca-cola. I would be this adventurous animal with the perfect life outlined for me except for one awful detail—inside of me would exist this yearning for something more. I would be whole and incomplete in the same dreadful instant. I would have dreams of these meaty-breaded visions topped with the works, and all at once I would know that I was being cheated out of something magnificent. And even if some day, some how, I were able to stumble upon an exquisite sandwich for my taking, my little cat mouth would have much difficulty engulfing the whole essence of the sandwich. Not only that, but acquiring any sort of pop to wash it down with would be next to impossible. And let us imagine that some how I was able to come across and eat a flavorsome sandwich, wash it down with a pop, and become momentarily satisfied—this could not possibly be a healthy scenario for a feline. And as an unhealthy feline, I would surely be an unhappy feline. After my bath last Sunday, I held my cat in my arms and thought to myself, “You poor, poor animal.” Then I made myself a sandwich.  30 things about me - cuz hey I am way cool too. Secrets are revealed, words never spoken, and dreams never seen.  1.) I was an accident, a so called baby, she said it before… 2.) Mother never let me forget that I was a problem  3.) YES, the world is a real bitch. 4.) I was logical as a child. 5.) I would rather science than do math any day. 6.) The teachers were not amused. 7.) I attended public school from K to 8th grade. 8.) I hated every minute of it. 9.) I knew I was gay when I was 8. 10.) I used to deliberately mutilate biblical verses during recitation to amuse my fans. 11.) Still the teachers were not amused. 12.) Tough crowd those teachers. 13.) I should have started this when I was 12. 14.) I got hammered on Jim Beam the same day I started smoking at age 12. Father had an awesome liquor cabinet. 15.) It got very messy… They would have been proud. 16.) I puked all over the teacher’s legs and into his loafers. 17.) I wanted to fuck the teachers.. Puking, same difference right?? 18.) I did my first hit of acid in 9th grade. 19.) My computer teacher was a FOX, I feigned near retardation to get one on one time with him.. 20.) He WAS amused and had no idea why. 21.) I had sex the first time in a tree fort 100 feet in the air. I was 13. 22.) When I was 13 my friends charged admission to watch me fuck guys at the garage window. 23.) He bought an ounce of weed. 24.) I was amused. Columbian Gold WOOOoo fucking HOOO!. 25.) My cover as a gay teen resulted in my fucking 23 girls in ninth grade. We can now afford angel dust.. yay. 26.) Nobody ever walked away without their cookie. 27.) I was an accomplished Fucker. 28.) Still my teachers were unimpressed. 29.) I was drunk and unconscious through most of High school, but had good marks. 30.) I quit polling the teachers - what do they know.

      If I was to have a butt, which i do not, I am negative on the hinnie quotient, I am I tell you, yall have seen it, there ain't much, anyways off the subject... and I was to parade in Europe this would be my poem:  (I wrote it) Salut! Tour de Bubble Butt. French men tend to be un-cut. I'm okay if they know how to fuck, Plus some old fashion hoovering suck. Great sex don't need a thousand bucks, All you need is MY bubble butt.  Not that I wish for sex, but it was a ramble of thoughts and that came out.  To a special someone: Seize upon that moment long ago  One breath away and there you will be  So young and carefree  Again you will see  That place in time...so gold  Steal away into that way back when  You thought that all would last forever  But like the weather  Nothing can ever...and be in time  Stay gold  But can it be  When we can see  So vividly  A memory  And yes you say  So must the day  Too, fade away  And leave a ray of sun  So gold  Life is but a twinkling of an eye  Yet filled with sorrow and compassion  though not imagined  All things that happen  Will age too old  Though gold

      Humor is what makes life bearable, I suppose. Without it life would be a pretty sad and shitty existence. But it doesn’t get you through nights like this. Not many things do.  	So if I am ever admitted to some self help program I am gonna have some fun with it. (Enters Will) Howdy yall, my name is Will"yum" and well… (Twirls hair) Tehe, hey you are a massive cutie there.  (Walks over and stands and then bends to be two inches away from the man’s face) I can’t stand to not have sex.  (Sits in man’s lap)  What do you say cocktails after this?  The cock can be yours and I’ll be the tail.  (Strokes his face) Tehe, come on you wanna… 	I got an Easter basket. Very creepy if you ask me.  I am 16 yall know.  I love candy and jelly beans, so this is a horrible holiday.  I am three pounds more then this morning and I am still going at the candy.  I hate the Easter Bunny; don’t tell me he isn’t real because you would be wrong.  And I have to end this grudge against him and so I have decided if I ever see the Easter Bunny that Papi and I will have our ways with him.  I wanna know if he likes cream filling.  I wanna show him once you have anal you don’t go normal.  Lol, Papi seems to like the idea of if he likes carrots so much, let him try something else to have in his mouth.  Sorry for the little children reading this… but I am merely thinking of the horrible time I will have trying to lose this candy weight. 	On another subject I have been able to convince a couple of people that I in-fact have received the wounds of Christ.  Yes, intentionally, but I have. You see I was back in the woods cutting down trees and splitting logs to fill the woodshed and one of the trees decided to fall the wrong way and fall hitting and knocking me over.  Well needless to say my leg looks as if I was attacked by some badger, or if you have seen the “Jesus Chainsaw Massacre” or “Passion of the Christ” those names are interchangeable, quite similar to the beginning flogging.  And when I fell my left hand was impaled by, for a lack of a better word stick.  It went all the way through and bruised the back of my hand, barely breaking the skin.  So, when I was writing in class one day, my hand started bleeding all over my paper, not a drop, drop bleed, but a steady pour of blood.  So, I am waiting for the next wound of Christ… I will keep you updated of this developing story… Will the teenage stigmatic.     Is there a cure for this disease? I AM SICK... of having the urge every hour to get on the internet to be fed useless information. It is truly a disease ... Of helping to fuel this consumer-driven society, where flash is more important than substance.  ... Of hanging around people who have no substance to their personalities, whatsoever... of constantly being let down. ... Of being made to feel stupid. I LONG. ... To find solace within me. ... To find happiness through things you cannot touch, see, hear, or smell. ... To be content. ... For quietness. Sometimes death doesn't seem so scary. I WISH. ... That I could figure out exactly what I want to do for the rest of my life. ... That I didn't have to ever worry about money, again.  ... That my parents didn't have to ever worry about money, again. ... That my sister and I didn't have so many fights when we were younger. ... That I could be a more patient person. ... I could be altruistic throughout the ENTIRE day. ... Sometimes, that I could go back and choose the "blue pill", living obliviously among the rest of the lemmings in this world.  .. That I had more friends who chose the "red pill". If you've read this far and are still awake, answer this:  If presented with an opportunity to choose the red or the blue pill, which would it be and why? USE THE COMMENT SECTION   My consumer lash back for Papi From: hcooling@hardwarecooling.com  Good Evening,  This email is in regards to the 2 port PCMCIA Firewire card we sold you. We wanted to know what you like and dislike about the product we sold you. If you had success or were un-successful getting the product to work we would like to hear from you. When you reply please be sure to specify the model laptop you are using, operating system and firewire device(s) used.  Thank You in advance.  Tom  HardwareCooling.com   Hello, "Tom".  I'm actually quite happy to hear from you and your company about the firewire card [read: "lemon"] you sold me. Some quick info: I use a Dell 4100 Laptop with a Pentium 3 processor and 256 mb of ram, which is running on Windows XP. The performance of the card has been nothing short of shotty. When transferring files between my laptop and iPod, there is consistently an error that pops up saying that the transfer was interrupted and could not be completed, when nothing was done to induce such a prompt. The result is that sometimes my files get transferred, whereas most other times it does not. I think the casinos give me better odds in Vegas, Tom. I happily took back a premium firewire card that worked due to my finding a very inexpensive card on your website, which I was referred to by a friend. Well, it's safe to say that he's no longer a friend of mine.  I guess the lesson learned here is - if it's too good to be true, it probably is. And as a law student, I probably should have known better ("caveat emptor" = let the buyer beware).  Needless to say, I am very unhappy with the quality of this product. Consequently, I take it as a reflection upon not only the quality of the products your company provides, but the quality of your company in general. This experience has influenced me not to purchase any products from Hardware Cooling in the future. Hey, like the saying goes, "you burn me once, shame on you. Burn me twice, shame on me".  Sincerely,  One unsatisfied customer ME  Ahh, poo so my father gets a new laptop soon, don’t ask me when, but now we share this computer.  His company is gonna purchase him a new one. So I have to sure this one…

      A writing about writing.  It’s always interesting to read what professional think of their profession.  So I was searching and this is the list of a very few writers that voiced their opinions:  The pages are still blank, but there is a miraculous feeling of the words being there, written in invisible ink and clamoring to become visible.  ~Vladimir Nabakov (Awesome arse guy!) Writing is pretty crummy on the nerves. ~ Paul Theroux Writing is a socially acceptable form of schizophrenia.  ~E.L. Doctorow The wastebasket is a writer's best friend.  ~Isaac Bashevis Singer Writing is easy:  All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.  ~Gene Fowler A synonym is a word you use when you can't spell the other one.  ~Baltasar Gracián There are men that will make you books, and turn them loose into the world, with as much dispatch as they would do a dish of fritters.  ~Miguel de Cervantes My language is the common prostitute that I turn into a virgin.  ~Karl Kraus What things there are to write, if one could only write them!  My mind is full of gleaming thought; gay moods and mysterious, moth-like meditations hover in my imagination, fanning their painted wings.  But always the rarest, those streaked with azure and the deepest crimson, flutter away beyond my reach.  ~Logan Pearsall Smith No author dislikes to be edited as much as he dislikes not to be published.  ~Russell Lynes One of the most feared expressions in modern times is "The computer is down." ~ Norman Augustine Manuscript: something submitted in haste and returned at leisure. ~ Oliver Herford I like to write when I feel spiteful; it's like having a good sneeze.~ D. H. Lawrence I always do the first line well, but have trouble doing the others. ~ Moliére The beautiful part of writing is that you don't have to get it right the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. ~ Robert Cromier Writers are always selling somebody out. ~ Joan Didion I love being a writer. What I can't stand is the paperwork. ~ Peter De Vries If you can't annoy somebody with what you write, I think there's little point in writing. ~Kingsley Amis A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end... but not necessarily in that order.  ~Jean Luc Godard The most beautiful things are those that madness prompts and reason writes.  ~André Gide, Journals, 1894 I do not like to write - I like to have written.  ~Gloria Steinem The best style is the style you don't notice.  ~Somerset Maugham I want to write books that unlock the traffic jam in everybody's head.  ~John Updike Loafing is the most productive part of a writer's life.  ~James Norman Hall Most editors are failed writers - but so are most writers.  ~T.S. Eliot Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart.  ~William Wordsworth    "Manic Depressive Mouse or The Bluebird Of Unhappiness"    My latest stupid rant against anti-depressants and other mental health stabilisers, taken from Saturday's Guardian. Drugs never did anything for me - I rarely took the many pills I was prescribed during my early teens, being too lazy, forgetful and suicidal - but I still get very annoyed at anyone who criticises these drugs without knowing anything about what it's like to need them or how much the risks and the side effects are really outweighed by the benefit for those they do help.  I also agree with Dave that the problem is that not enough is provided in the way of care to accompany the drugs prescribed. I would still be on pills today, but for the fact that I know it would mean having to see a psychiatrist every week again, talking about problems the doctor doesn't or won't understand unless they fit to a check box scheme. 'Can't leave the house? That's a tick for social phobia. Can't sit down for ten minutes at a time? There's your Attention Deficit Disorder. General malaise? That'll be the borderline personality at work...'  When I arrived at university I suffered the general sense of being suddenly set adrift that I think most people feel for the first few weeks. But it seemed worse than it was at the time, and given my history of manic depression I decided after either one or two weeks that I wanted to see a doctor. I was given an appointment the same day, and after fifteen minutes with the doctor I walked away with a prescription for a hefty dosage (certainly not the minimum she could have prescribed) of a new drug called Venlafaxine/Effexor. This is a strong drug, sometimes known to induce mania and not recommended in anything other than minimal doses for people who are potentially suicidal. Great - but this is what happens when people operate on checklists which their patients know better than they do.  For most people the problem works the other way - they're in genuine need of help, but too human to fit into the necessary checkbox. Some of them don't need drugs, or need drugs other than the ones they end up being prescribed - and this is often where some of the problems arise. Others end up suicidal but still unable to get the pills they need, forever consigned to 'borderline personality' (i.e. attention seeker) or some even less subtle category in the doctor's notes.  I'm not sure what could be done to change this, since doctors these days have to cover their backs far too much to give the really individual care many people need. But before we direct our attacks at the drugs which are keeping people alive, we need to look carefully at the mental health system which is not.

      Time for a frickin’ list that will bore everyone to tears (I thought PMS was last week???): 1) Eating - was eating a frozen pizza, imagine that - remember kids, starch is our friend! 2) Drinking - a glass of wine (again, no surprise there) Ha!  Please, I will stick to juice. 3) Reading- I do intend to start "What Your Dog Can Teach You About Living A Happy Life" (co-written by a local author) - I'm guessing that I won't find "Eating Socks" as one of the chapters, right? 4) Thinking - Things could be worse, I could be Martha Stewart 5) Doing – Chewing off two bad fingernails (don't worry, they had it coming) Bonus: Aren’t I exciting?  What do your shoes say about you?  I feel that shoes are a good preliminary indicator of personality, especially here in nyc. What kicks you flash usually give off certain clues to your character (i.e. whether you are laid back and chill, open-minded, uptight, unoriginal, etc.) Here's my attempt at psychoanalyzing the wearers of various popular brands: Kenneth Cole- You have a stuffy personality. Originality and imagination are not your strong points.  Prada- You're high maintenance and you either: (a) like to flaunt your daddy's wealth, or  (b) are probably asian and can't afford the shoes, but buy them anyway to make everyone think you're flaunting your daddy's wealth, which of course, is amassed through the family liquor store or dry-cleaning business. (Buy me a pair! Fine, I see how it is.) Pony- You are a fairly laid back and open-minded person (I own a pair! They frickin’ rock) Adidas- I represent the old school, but in actuality, I'm just a poser who is really reppin' the new school trendiness of going old-school.  (I have these as well) Diesel-I'm trendy and gay! (I own none, I wanna pair though…hmm...) Campers- You have a good sense of humor. You kind of have to in order to wear something that looks like smurf shoes. (1 pair) Nike- I'm a conformist (1 old pair due to ex's influence, who, by the way, was the poster-child for conformity). New Balance- The old people who wore them years before they got popular are down-to-earth. The young people that now buy them - see Nike/Diesel (Awww crappers!  A pair) Aasics- Health conscious; serious runners. Reebok- you're Mexican. 'Really-Long-And-Pointy-Heels' every chick has bought in the past 2 years (e.g. witch shoes)- I watch too much Sex and the City and need to stop playing make-believe with my girlfriends when we go out on Saturday nights. (One pair, j/k, j/p!  No, really I don’t.  I don’t fine don’t believe me.) Knee-High Leather Boots- I'm easy and I love attention. So there you have it. You may not agree with me on some or all points, but do I really give a poot?  You're a good man, Charlie Brown! Sitting in class. Waiting for something great to happen. I'm dreaming my life away. I'll bet most of you didn't know that I suffer from a debilitating disease. Yes, you heard correctly. I've been diagnosed with... wanderlust. A sexy word, no doubt, but devastating nonetheless. Even the simplest tasks seem impossible to accomplish for those that suffer from wanderlust. I constantly dream of traveling to far off places I've never been to or into the great wilderness, when instead I should be paying attention to how much this teacher is trying to reach out to me, washingthe dishes piling up in my kitchen, or studying. Bo-ring!  But, alas I have to live this mundane life… So, if anyone out there has any suggestions for a washed-up never-has-been student...then please, let me hear it. Here are my skills to help with recommendations: 1. An amatuer popper and locker (essentially a different form of breakdancing) 2. I like to cook. 3. I speak fluent German, some French, Old English, and Hittie.  (Two dead langauages! What know? Huh?) 4. I am very confident when it comes to public speaking and sociable when conversing with strangers. 5. I can be very convincing. (Example: 'Dude, send me some money. No, for reals. Send me some money.' You can't teach that. That's all me.) 6. I can dance like a girl, but well I am not. 7. Yoga? 8. I can touch my nose to my knees standing up not bending my legs and can do a back bend! 9. I can get in fights with trees and lose miserably. 10.  I am me! Bonus skill: typing "bonus" entries in every top 5 category I've ever produced on this blog.

      Well, I had an April Fool’s day blog planned…  but that didn’t happen…  so here is is…         Thursday, April 01, 2004 OMG  My sister was backing up and she ran over the mommy cat. Now we have five motherless kittens.        The Resurrection of the Cat  The cat is alive. Its death was an April Fool Joke. It's alive and kicking. Now that Holy Week is coming up, does that mean we'll have crazy people flocking to go see "The Passion of the Christ". And whoever came up with the 3 pm death of Jesus. Same thing with the date of his birth. Aye. It's Eucharist time. If you don't take it any other time, they want you taking it now. Or so they say. Lol, right. I like my sinner status. Spot the evil ones sitting down. The New Alliance...eh?   2, 4, 6, 8, God is good, God is straight!  Daddy has pointed me in the direction of an article in yesterday's Guardian about sexual reorientation therapy. Some of the therapy mentioned, particularly that involving men using more 'masculine' vocabulary, reminded me of nothing so much as the film But I'm A Cheerleader. A great indie comedy, it centers on the experiences of Megan, a cheerleader who's taken to a camp designed to 'straighten' people out, after her family collect 'evidence' of her lesbianism. This evidence includes the fact that she's a vegetarian and likes listening to Melissa Etheridge. A lot of the amusement lies in the minor details - RuPaul is cast as the 'ex-gay' male leader of the camp, but can't stop looking at the muscular boy passing by; the camp uniform is PVC in baby blue and pink; the girls are given corrective electric shock-giving toys for when they have sinful thoughts, which the goth girl ends up using for her own amusement... But the best bits are the gendered therapies, where the boys are taught to kick a football and cut wood (the axe flies into the woods behind them), and the girls are taught to cook and rear children. The final class involves simulated intercourse between the participants. At graduation, only 3 of about 16 participants remain, and the graduation ceremony is ambushed by people from the ex-ex-gay survivors of the camp, coming to rescue them. While the film's very enjoyable, there's a serious point to be made, as the Guardian article shows. Most of the people who enter into reorientation therapy do so only because of family or other pressure - their cure is a function of their willingness to put themselves aside for their family. A large amount of this pressure is religious, and among the 'successful' changes found by one survey the great majority were said their religion was very important to them. This pressure exists in England, too, with the 'spiritual leader' of the Alpha course - designed to convert people to Christianity in ten weeks - famously comparing homosexuals with paedophiles, and the course in general promoting the wonders of 'cures' for homosexuality, while condemning even those straight people who see nothing wrong with it. There's a good article about this here. The religious right continues to promote this attitude to sexuality. Even the most enlightened of the fundamentalists seem to believe that, while homosexuality may be something natural. Artboy Meets Artgirl No, don’t tell me that everything’s in vain Don’t you know that every war will end ‘Cause when artboy meets artgirl there’s gonna be love  Lust and hunger, gluttony and greed Yes, it’s true that bad and mean succeed But when artboy meets argirl there’s gonna be love if artgirl needs artboy enough  I’ll balance their checkbooks, I’ll do what they can’t do I’ll clean their apartments, just as long as they get through  No, don’t tell me the sky is always grey Don’t you know that it will clear some day ‘Cause when artboy meets artgirl there’s gonna be love if artgirl needs artboy enough  Then the world just stops and then everyone starts dancing As they tell you about their symphonies and the poetry they’ve made As they guide you through their galleries of all the wonders they create  No, don’t tell me that everythings gone wrong Don’t you now that this time we’ll be strong ‘Cause when artboy meets artgirl there’s gonne be love if artgirl needs artboy enough  Then the world just stops and then everyone starts dancing As they tell you about their symphonies and the poetry they’ve made As they guide you through their galleries of all the wonders they create  More love, more love, more happy, happy love.

       HOT GUYS LIST!  Let's usher in Spring with my HOT GUYS LIST! Here are my Top 7, in somewhat of an order:  7. ADAM BRODY  not to be confused with Adrien Brody of The pianist (2002). Why He's HOT: I've never seen Adam in interviews, so I don't know what he's like outside of his character of Seth Cohen on FOX's, The O.C. But Seth is witty, smart, & adorable - neurosis 'n all!  6. JOHN MAYER Why He's HOT: His lips and his voice. Umm...I'm not 100% diggin' his music, but whatever, he's cute! "'Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for"? What's that supposed to mean? Sounds like an egocentric anthem to me. Guys, if you ever want to up that sex appeal, learn to master a musical instrument. (Accordian doesn't really count, unless you're like 80 years old, Jewish, & live in a convalescence home.) Acceptable instruments include: guitar and piano.  5. FINLEY QUAYE Why He's HOT: Listen to his single, "Dice" from his latest release, Much More Than Much Love (2004) and you'll know why! His music is such an eclectic blend of electronica, trip-hop, & reggae. Any guy who can rock a pair of Wallabees is a friend of mine! Interesting Factoids: Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Finley is of Ghanaian/Scottish background. He is also rumoured to be the uncle of Tricky.   4. RIVERS CUOMO Why He's HOT: Okay, whenever I tell my guy friends about my crush on Rivers, they're like "Why? He's an uber-geek!" But therein lies the attraction - shy, smart, & sensitive with just a dash of geekiness. Rivers, if you're reading this - glasses on, hair relatively kept, & facial hair off. Interesting Factoids: A former Harvard student, rumoured to be a "Rice King", re: "El Scorcho" and another something a former coworker from HMV told me - that he hires ONLY pretty Asian girls as his personal assistant. Rivers is probably one of the few exceptions where an Asian-fetish isn't creepy!  3. MIKE WHITE  Why He's HOT: Mike is such a talented writer, penning Hollywood comedies such as Orange County (2002), The Good Girl (2002), & School of Rock (2003). I'd like to believe that you can fall in love with someone based on their talent. What do you think? Sometimes Mike & Gael switch places on my list.  2. GAEL GABRIEL BERNAL Why He's Hot: This chico is muy caliente! I was going to attach a pic of him as a priest in El Crimen del Padre Amaro (2002) because I thought it was soo ironic that Gael Gabriel would be cast for that role. A priest? Since when did you ever meet a HOT, young priest that looked like him??!! Answer: NEVER. Gael Gabriel appears to be comfortable enough in his sexuality to put his arm around his fellow male costars/directors/whoever - geez, if he's gay may I find a razor so that I can slit my wrists. Wait I like guys too! So what if he's 5'6", I don't like guys who are too tall anyways. Foreign men just have this certain kinda allure to them, like they're humble (i.e. non-cocky), more romantic, & they would never cheat on you. Who knows, I could be wrong & Gael Gabriel could be a total dawg with STDs! Sometimes Gael & Mike switch places on my list. Interesting Factoids: Born in Guadaljara, Mexico. Is close friends with Diego Luna, costar of Y tu mama tambien (2001). Can speak English, Italian, Spanish, & French.  1. RILEY PAUL-PATRICK HAYS Why He's Hot: Well, to start off his personality is more important to me.  He is the one of the sweetest, funniest spiffiest bois in the world.  He has this amazing aura to him.  He has the greatest sense in fashion in the entire world.  I would die to live in his closet.  Then of course to his looks.  Baby, damn!  Deep rich green eyes, fair skin the color of ivory.  A small slender frame with a flat stomach.  Needless for me to go on, and I am the luckiest boi in the world since I have him. Isn't it sad that I couldn't even come up with 3 more HOT GUYS in order to do a Top 10? Am I forgetting anyone?  That is all gravy, my baby's up there...  The following blog was the result of my recent contemplations of expanding/changing my current circle of friends: Have you ever seen people and for one reason or another think that you 2 would be good friends? (When I worked at HMV, I would have this feeling whenever I liked a person's taste in music &/or their particular style or "look".) If you've had this feeling before, have you done anything about it? What did you say exactly?  Making friends is definitely different if the person you want to befriend is a classmate, coworker, or friend-of-a-friend. What I'm talking about is befriending a complete stranger. Just the mere concept of turning a stranger into a friend is so bizarre to me. When was the last time I put myself out there in order to even introduce myself to someone who had no ties to me whatsoever? Answer: I don't think I've ever do that. Have any of my current friends been attained through my own initiative? Answer: I don't think so. I think they all started off having connections to me somehow. In my surroundings, if a stranger says, "Hi" my instant reaction is, "What do you WANT from me??!!" Also depending on how they look and what the particular circumstances are, I think: Do he need spare change? OR Is he high/drunk?

        What it is to be young, gifted, and ironic...     Wasps are neither good-looking nor shiny     (They definately aren't as cool as sheep)  A wasp just flew into my room. It’s half eleven at night, and all good wasps should be in bed. But this one was a rebel, an individual, a protestor against convention, so, as is usually the way of these things, it had to die. I emptied half a can of Raid at it and squashed it to a smear under the heel of my shoe. You may think this cruel, but wasps are evil and deserve everything they get. Imagine if wasps were the size of human beings. Just imagine. It was followed soon after by a daddy long-legs, but I didn’t care about that. Just as long as it doesn’t make off with any of my CDs.   The Bush Administration continues to shock and awe    I am yet in a state of shock and awe over the seemingly never ending revelations of highly undesirable realities that the Bush Regime is directly responsible for, including the brutal killing of Nick Berg; not so much owing to the behaviors, actions, and political maneuverings of Bush and his boys, nor the actions of the militant rebels, but to the widespread ignorance with which the average American citizen comprehends what has been taking place all along. There was a time when the only people not totally turned-off to the company of born-again Christians were either others who’ve been reborn, and those so lost and gullible that they willingly drink arsenic-laced Kool-Aide. Yet today, there sits in the Commander and Chief’s chair a born-again Christian who believes that he has been chosen by God to lead this historic grab at Global Rule, and people are okay with this! A raging dry-drunk on an ego-trip beyond his wildest dreams! I am disheartened, but not disillusioned, which me thinks the average American citizen is.    Oh Boy!  Of cell phones, signal quality, and loud voices.   I was watching TV today and saw this commercial for some company's wireless service. They were showing a train full of cell users with signal quality bars over their head and one guy had really bad signal. This guy was basically screaming into his cell phone. Now. There are 3 things wrong with this one. #1, I absolutely HATE people who yell into their cell phones. That's just a personal pet peeve. But #2 is that ALL modern cell phones are digital. Now if you didn't know, digital cell phones use error corrected packets of data to carry the voice signal. When the signal quality fades, the packets pick up large amounts of errors, and when the packets are too corrupted to correct, they are dropped. This causes breaks in the voice stream. Yelling will not prevent packet loss. #3 is the problem of over modulation. Basically because we're talking a digital stream, there is maximum limit to the sound intensity. If you go beyond this limit, the quantitizer maxes out and won’t go any higher. This leads to clipping (The squaring off of loud sounds) in the audio stream. But everyone seems to yell when they begin to loose signal. The part that confuses me ('cause I occasionally catch MYSELF doing it...) is WHY we do it... Ring ring!!!   More naughtiness:    A Good Way to Meet People. (Or) Panhandling in Suburbia. (Or) How To Get a Guy To Buy You Dinner.   Try, unsuccessfully, to walk through the drive-through of your local fast food joint. Ask the guy in the car behind you to order food for you. In exchange, you'll give him your credit card to pay for his food as well. Stand next to his window as he orders a late dinner for you, Person B and himself. Walk to the first window and try, unsuccessfully, to give him your credit card, while Person B vigorously searches her purse for money or a checkbook.  He'll look at you and say, "If you're hungry enough to try to walk through a drive-through, then this is on me."  Hand him a business card with "We owe you – me and Person B" on the back of it.  Laugh hysterically during the entire walk home, while eating your cheeseburger or salad if you are a vegetarian in Ben and my case.

        The Oracle speaks    I was leaning out of my window, smoking a cigarette. A blackbird landed on the sloping roof outside, not three feet from my face. It fixed me with its glossy blackbird eye. "Cheep cheep," It said. "Cheep chirp, tweet-tweet chirrup whistle-tweet." It nodded its head once, as if in satisfaction of a message well delivered, and immediately flew off again. I have no doubt that I have just been told something very important, or amusing, or wise. Perhaps all three. But my inability to speak Blackbird means that I will forever remain in ignorance. I knew I should have paid more attention to languages in school.   And to answer Shaney-poo’ s lil’ inquiry about the behavior of smoke, this was in regards to when Shane (my cousin/brother from Virginia) and I would sit outside on our patio and smoke cigarettes together, it was a form of escape, a form of release, it was our time.  Of course Samantha was always welcome.  Well, anyways one time we were smoking and Shane had opened up a new pack and went to crumble up the cellophane wrapper, and I grabbed it and blew some of my cigarette smoke into it as a trick called “the smoke waterfall”  To answer this, the smoke is contained within the wrapper and so by science all gases will fill the container first to equal a form of homeostasis then, it will try to equalize with the environment outside to make the illusion of a waterfall.               Naughty Naughty    One thing about having a school or office day like this is, you get bored. Well, no shit Sherlock, I suppose. But when I get bored In start thinking of things. Things to do. Naughty things. Things such as… (I have never done this minus the ones I admit) 1) Sending offensive e-mails from somebody else’s PC A fun one if there’s someone you really don’t like.   2) Changing the signs in the toilets The toilets are the only place in the modern office where you can be sure you aren’t under observation. Note all the signs saying things like  “Please do not put paper towels in the toilets.” Note the size of the sign and the font it is written in. If necessary take it down and photocopy it. Then produce your own version, exactly the same in style, only now it says, “Please do not wash baby dolphins down the sinks, as it makes them cry.” Or “Will fat people please use the downstairs facilities in case of ceiling collapse.” Or, on one spectacularly misanthropic occasion, “You really are a sad, worthless fucker. Why not kill yourself?” Most of the fun comes from sticking up a fresh one as soon as possible after the old ones have been torn down. Get steadily more offensive as you go along, and enjoy a quiet chuckle to yourself as you listen to the office gossip about the Phantom Sign-Producing Maniac. “If you’re sat on this toilet seat, you’ve probably caught tapeworms.” Ah, happy days.  3) Blatant theft of stationery And by ‘blatant’ I mean literally by the skipload. Pens, staplers, hole-punches, highlighters, diaries, A4 pads, guillotines, laminators (I actually have a laminating machine at home that I half-inched from a previous school… it’s run out of plastic sheets though.) And of course, reams and reams of computer paper, more than enough to print out a few hundred copies of your new, War And Peace-sized novel. Tippex. Pritt-sticks, Sellotape, calculators, permanent markers (By the boxload) labels, hole reinforcers, computer disks… You need never set foot in Staples again!  4) Having pornography delivered to the office in someone else’s name Oh, that one was funny.  5) Create your own ID card This one is best done at home. Scan your ID card and fiddle with the image on Photoshop, giving yourself (For example) horns and glowing red demon eyes. Change the wording underneath from “This pass does not entitle the user to access restricted areas” to the more fun “This pass entitles the user to the life of your firstborn child.” Cover with sticky-back plastic and slot into the holder in front of the old one. (An alternative is to simply replace your photo with a downloaded image of, say, Myra Hindley). Proceed to wear your new badge for at least three months without anybody noticing, especially the supposedly vigilant security guards at the front entrance. Think about how clever you are, and what fools you are surrounded by. Enjoy your smugness: This is your time.  There are others. Endless others. Just let the boredom be your guide… onward, my disciples, and destroy!

       Masturbation Pet Cruelty   I really should see about getting some comments system set up on this thing, so I can find out if anyone apart from me is actually reading it, or if, as I suspect, I'm wanking in the dark. Metaphorically.  I assure you. I could use the new Blogger comments but I've heard that they suck donkeys. Metaphorically. And other systems require you to splice a bit of HTML into the code of your template, which if you know sod all about HTML is a daunting task. One slip and I could ruin it forever, rather like gouging out a hamster's eye with a cocktail stick, only without all the shouting, crying and trips to the child psychologist.  I am to lazy for that so the Blogger ones are open.  Mmm, what was I talking about again?     UPDATES, UPDATES, UPDATES!  Well, I need to bring the folks up to date.  I am happy; my life is on a real upswing.  I decided to break up with Riley, I forgot to mention this.  I did love him, but to tell the truth, I saw in the beginning that this wasn’t going to work out.  I put all of my heart and emotion into the relationship, and he was well to busy being piss drunk.  I did try, but it seems that he was way to busy drowning away his own problems.  But, the upswing that I promised?  Benny Boy.  SUPRIZE! (Yall saw that coming I bet)  I look forward to an e-mail from him every morning,  Do you know what it feels like to wake up in the morning and to know that you have something from someone that cares for you?  Amazing! And to tell the truth Ben fits my pattern for a better relationship; he is 14, a youngin like Michael.  And he has the biggest heart in the world, so here is a little information on Benji… I assure you more will come later on…   ~*~*~*~*~*~BEGIN BENNY BOY”S PROFILE ~*~*~*~*~*~   Full name:  Benjamin Paul Katke, mine is Kraft, how odd …  Anagram:  Japan–like Bunkmate  Age:  5434 days old, 726 younger than me  Current cool points level:   19,473 points  Location:  Merrill, WI (Two hours north, past Stevens Point near Wausau)  Most looks like:  a younger Jake Gyllenhaal, but I think that he looks much cuter, especially with his glasses on then he is all sophisticated. *drools*  Occupation:  High school freshie   Astrological sign:  Cancer, me too!  Two individuals that devote themselves to the relationship… what is wrong here, nothing!  Likes:  Indie films, alternative music, track and field, and umm… me?  And may I add that I love indie films like “Memento,” “Donnie Darko,” “Tattered Angel,” “Rushmore,” “The Brotherhood,” and “Enough Already” to mention a lil’ bit…   Favourite cereal:  Frosted Shredded Wheat, my favourite as well! Since they no longer make my Monopoly cereal… Damn corporation   Clothing style:  Prep  Favourite store:  Hollister  Observancy level:   Supreme, example: “Ok I'm not saying this just to flatter you, this is true, I do treasure everything you write to me (if we were on the phone and I was saying this, you'd make that oh-so-adorable “Awww” sound, a sound that “ think you make better than anybody on earth, god, it's so cute, and then you'd say "unfair!" to which “ would apologize).   ~*~*~*~*~*~END BENNY BOY’S PROFILE~*~*~*~*~*    (I really, really, really and so frickin’ happy, I ain’t stopped smiling since he said, “Yes” Seriously!  OMG, he is so amazing…)        Well, guess what? Guess what?    More good news, not as good as the first but still good… I started my new job as a florist.  Odd, right?  Lol, I mean come on you know how many high schoolers that are florists, umm… none besides me!  I really think I am going enjoy it.com.  I am not standing behind some greasy grill flipping burgers and having oil splash all over me.  It ain’t typical, the women even told me she has never in 20 plus years hired anyone under the age of 18 but she thinks I have the skills and talents necessary to make it.  Wohoo! I wonder is there an organization called Young Florists of America? The YFA?  Lol, how ironic is it that some pansy boy is a florist?  I mean, lol, think, it isn’t on the top ten gay jobs list, but it is pretty up there.  Interior designer, fashion designer, shoe store worker… (Sorry Thomas I had to!), hairstylist and now: florist! Buts with this job I get both creativity and practical people skills to develop.  It is a conglomeration of many different jobs.  I am a cashier, I arrange flowers, I work on displays, and I work on presentations. I do prep work like cutting wires, stocking, plant care, and the works!  I am so excited and the pay ain’t too horrible! Peace!

        So back to me being an activist:    I hate the president and I hate the damn church.  I truly think that if Bush were to tell the homosexual community what he really thought of them it would so something like this: THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning. This past year, in a shocking act of civil disobedience, states all over gave the green light to open the gates of Hell and start marrying off pole-smokers and rug-munchers just as fast as their limp-wristed, little lady paw could sign swishy John Hancocks on Fagtown wedding licenses. To add insult to injury, Mr. Newsom – a Democrat, naturally – intentionally kicked off this abomination on Valentines Day, a holiday invented by Hallmark specifically so normal people could look down on queers.  Well society has another thing coming if he thinks I'm just gonna sit idly by with Laura's thumb up my ass while people take advantage of people like California Governor Schwarzenigger's wholesomeness by sanctifying the unholy unions of pitcher and catcher, butch and dyke, village person and other village person, and so on down the mincing Conga line.  Now, don't get me wrong. When you're nine years old, it's perfectly normal behavior to, say, get a little frisky with your fellow Camp Cayuga Cemosabe bunkmates – so long as it stays in the showers or the woods. But when you keep on playing "Doggy, Doggy, Where's Your Bone?" or "Fist the Tail of the Donkey" right into adultdom, you might as well have painted a pentagram on the ground with fetus blood, piss on the bible, and cry aloud, "Are you there, Satan? It's me, Mary!" And no, I ain't talking about the Virgin Matriarch.  As President, it is my responsibility to confront any and all such enemies of the libidinal status quo. And so this morning, in addition to calling on Congress to pass my constitutional amendment, I want to deliver a brief message to any sodomites who might be thinking of sashaying down to city hall to get themselves one of these novelty fake marriages. Here we go...  Attention all deviant abominations of the United States. This is your President you voted overwhelmingly against speaking. As you no doubt have been told, same-sex marriage is illegal in the states. That said, I know that many of you Adams and Steves believe that by breaking that law, you are being some kind of civil rights trailblazers. You think you're like that rude colored lady Rosa Parks, who suffered from delusions of non-inferiority. You think you're like that uppity broad Susan B. Anthony, who hallucinated that women are capable of having opinions. And yes, you probably think you're like Richard and Mildred Loving, who demanded that Virginia give them special rights to flaunt the unthinkable perversion of interracial marriage. Well guess what? You're right. You're just like all of those people – a sickening byproduct of liberalism. But just like my right-wing personal forefathers who fought tooth and nail against the aforementioned scum, I too shall do everything in my power to ensure that you remain second-class citizens: reviled, despised, and worthy only of being dragged for miles behind the pickup trucks of my most devoted ideological brethren.  In short, go ahead and try to marry your own gender. But know that when any man fucks with another man, he's also fucking with a Bush. And when you do that, a Bush gets nasty. And a nasty Bush is the last thing you wanna fuck around with. Just ask my dad, he knows.  I took his pension checks. And trust me I know a lot, my father thought me things.  So umm... there!   Then we have the damn Vatican Pope... The Vatican and Metrosexuality...  Imagine if it was true!! The following article appeared in The Onion.  Catholic Church Condemns Metrosexuality  VATICAN CITY—Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Monday that metrosexuality, the trend of heterosexual men co-opting the aesthetics of homosexual men, is strictly prohibited under Catholic doctrine. "The truly faithful will avoid the temptation to adopt this hip urban lifestyle," Navarro-Valls said. "The devout Catholic must remain on the path toward salvation, no matter how good he'd look in an Armani pullover, and no matter how much he might covet his neighbor's set of Williams-Sonoma lobster forks." Karl Weis, director of the New York-based activist group Freedom From Religion, responded to the ban by stating that "metrosexuality is so 2003."

      GRRR! I want an awesome anagram like Japan Like Bunkmates!  Benny Boy is lucky... and Benny Boy, I forgot that this song by "As I sat sadly by her side" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds!  I forgot to send this one.  I think this is on the top on the list.  So, Benny Boy and the world this is my favourite sad song.   As I sat sadly by her side At the window, through the glass She stroked a kitten in her lap And we watched the world as it fell past Softly she spoke these words to me And with brand new eyes, open wide We pressed our faces to the glass As I sat sadly by her side  She said, "Father, mother, sister, brother, Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer, Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest Earth and moon and sun and stars Planets and comets with tails blazing All are there forever falling Falling lovely and amazing"  Then she smiled and turned to me And waited for me to reply Her hair was falling down her shoulders As I sat sadly by her side  As I sat sadly by her side The kitten she did gently pass Over to me and again we pressed Our different faces to the glass "That may be very well", I said "But watch the one falling in the street See him gesture to his neighbours See him trampled beneath their feet All outward motion connects to nothing For each is concerned with their immediate need Witness the man reaching up from the gutter See the other one stumbling on who can not see"  With trembling hand I turned toward her And pushed the hair out of her eyes The kitten jumped back to her lap As I sat sadly by her side  Then she drew the curtains down And said, "When will you ever learn That what happens there beyond the glass Is simply none of your concern? God has given you but one heart You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers  And God does not care for your benevolence Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others Nor does he care for you to sit At windows in judgement of the world He created While sorrows pile up around you Ugly, useless and over-inflated"  At which she turned her head away Great tears leaping from her eyes I could not wipe the smile from my face As I sat sadly by her side    Questions to Ruminate On...   Do stairs go up or down? Why is there a top line on lined paper if we never use it? Do coffins have lifetime guarantees? Why do the numbers on phones go down while the numbers on calculators go up? If Hooters were to become a door-to-door service would they have to change their name to Knockers? If the sky is the limit, then what is space, over the limit? Are children who act in rated 'R' movies allowed to see them?  Can you make a candle out of your earwax? When French people swear do they say pardon my English? Aren't the 'good things that come to those who wait' just the leftovers from the people that got there first? If the swat team breaks down your door do they have to replace it later? Can a fire truck park in the fire lane? Can it be cloudy and foggy at the same time? "Cute as a button" Is that supposed to be a compliment? Since when are buttons cute? Can you breathe out of your nose and mouth at the same time? Are marbles made of marble?  Why does the last piece of ice always stick to the bottom of the cup? If you pay for a vacation and your plane crashes on the way there, do you get you money back? (Granted you lived) Why did Yankee Doodle name the feather in his hat Macaroni? Who was the first person to look at a cow and say, "I think I'll squeeze these dangly things here and drink what comes out"? Who was the first person to say, "See that chicken over there ... I'm gonna eat the first thing that comes out if its butt"? Isn't Disney World just a people trap operated by a mouse? If electricity comes from electrons, does morality come from morons? Do illiterate people get the full effect of Alphabet soup? Can you get cornered in a round room?  Why do we wash behind our ears? Who really looks there? Why don't the hairs on your arms get split ends? If an atheist has to go to court, do they make him swear on the Bible? Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but its ok to use a handicapped toilet? In that song, she'll be coming around the mountain, who is she? How come we say 'It's colder than hell outside' when isn't it realistically always colder than hell since hell is supposed to be fire and brimstone? Why is it that if something says, "do not eat" on the packaging it becomes extra tempting to eat? Why are people so scared of mice, yet we all love Mickey Mouse?  Wouldn't it be smart to make the sticky stuff on envelopes taste like chocolate? Why are the commercials for cable companies on cable but not on regular television? Don't they want the people without cable to buy the cable?  "Have you ever noticed that if you rearranged the letters in mother in law, they come out to Woman Hitler?" Isn't it funny how the word 'politics' is made up of the words 'poli' meaning 'many' in Latin, and 'tics' as in 'bloodsucking creatures’? Why is it that when things get wet they get darker, even though water is clear?? Why is it that when you get out of a swimming pool, your urine is hotter when you use the restroom? Can mute people burp? What happens if you put this side up face down while popping microwave popcorn? Why is chopsticks one of the easiest songs to play on the piano, but the hardest thing to eat with? How come you play at a recital, but recite at a play? If a fork were made of gold would it still be considered silverware? If heat rises, then shouldn't hell be cold? Why is there that little space inside strawberries, as if it was meant for a pit, and then the seeds are on the outside? Why isn't chocolate considered a vegetable, if chocolate comes from cocoa  beans, and all beans are a vegetable? Do they have girl’s bathrooms in gay bars? Why is toilet bowl cleaning liquid only blue? Why is it when we talk to God we are praying, but when God talks to us we are put into the loony bin? Why do you go “back and forth” to town if you really must go forth before you go back? Why doos shaped macaroni taste better than the normal kind? Why is vanilla ice cream white when vanilla extract is brown? Why can't you get a tan on your palms? If your sick for one week and on one of those days they had to cancel school because of snow, do you have to make up that day in June? Why do dogs sniff other dog’s bottoms to say hello, why don’t they just bark in their face or something? Why do companies offer you "free gifts?" Since when has a gift NOT been free? If something "goes without saying," why do people still say it?  You know the expression, "Don't quit your day job?" Well what do you say to people that work nights?

        Ooodly ooodly ooodly ooodly ooodly ooodly, fun fun fun -- Yeah!   Completely unrelated to anything, but I just rewatched Chuck & Buck (2000) that was on Showcase by my #3 (sometimes #2) favourite guy, Mike White. I forgot just how gay, or homoerotic the film was until tonight. Maybe it's because I didn't really know who Mike White was when I originally saw C&B. I was mentioning the theme of the film to a friend of mine and I asked him out of curiousity, "Do you think Mike White is gay?" G's response was, "No, that's his character!" I firmly believe that as a writer, a lot of the stuff that we put on paper (thematically) is stuff that's in our sub/conscious. Either that, or you're just a really good writer with the ability to create an entire world full of characters from scratch, i.e. your own imagination without any of your subconscious filtering through. Just something interesting to think about!    Friday.    So today is Friday, the best day of the week. My rankings of the days of the week? 1. Friday (last day of work before the weekend, anticipation is high/Friday gets REAL good at about 5 p.m.) 2. Saturday (who's gonna argue with a day off!?) 3. Sunday (3rd 'cause it's still a day off, but it's also the day before the worst day of the week) 4. Thursday (it's almost FRIDAY!) 5. Wednesday (eh, stuck in the middle again) 6. Tuesday (at least it's not MONDAY!) 7. Monday (ugh, is it Friday yet!?)    ADVICE FOR NON-COLLEGE BOUND  ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE  1. Go to College 2. If not doing #1: Get a Job 3. If 1&2 don't work out for you ...   4. Save your high school school phonebooks, since you will not meet that many new people, you will have a shortage of parties - also, find a community college website. Now you know when school is out- and your old firends will be home 5. Unless you were fun to party with in high school, one or two of your old friends might actually talk to you - and therefor invite you to a party.  6. Like all kids your age in school, you too will drink all the time, any time. the difference is that you don't have to go to Conceptual 19th Century English the next morning, so you can drink more - and not worry about the hang over 7. When hung over, stay in bed 8. When your college going friends come by, they will try to make you feel "stupider" (lol) and use words like "Conceptual arithmatic". all they are doing is combineing words - you can too. some examples are, "Beer Bong" "Beer Bottle" "need Money" "Fuck off" - see its easy. 9. You will find that you have absolutely no sense of time. it will be 7:30am when you go to bed one day, and maybe the next three you dont sleep at all. your life will have absolutely no way to recycle its self, unless you go to church. when your friends call and say wanna do something, you never have to worry about doing anything the next day 10. For the first few months, strip clubs can be fun, until you run out of money, like your college going friends 11. When in the strip club, DO NOT TOUCH! 12. Watch MTV ... why, simple the shows they have were made for people like you. most tv shows air weekly, those shows have multiple episodes daily, so you can follow along better than someone who has to go to classes 13. Get used to living with your parents. thats right, if you think that with out a job, you can afford to live elsewhere, your wrong. If you can crash with a girl friend by all means do it.  14. Friends houses are good sources of food. when your pantry runs dry, hit up your friends. eat dinner with them if you can.  15. Start working out - inmates do it all day, so they dont get bored ... you should too. you too can fall victim to the freshman 15 even when your not a freshman 16. Procrastinate - you are a god at it. college kids think they are best at such things, but think about it - you put off going to school - you got them there. 17. Money - you will not have much of it. my theory is enjoy it when you have it, sleep when you dont. A) live like a king while you can, otherwise bills will claim it all B) sleep - you don't feel hunger and time passes quickly. 18. Get to know your creditors - so when they call you every day, you can talk to them, like "hi fred, how you doing? how did your kids do on that big standardized test the other day? wife still banging the mail man? ... when you make friends with them, they might erase your debt - highly unlikely, but you can dream right - besides, its someone to talk to in the middle of the day 19. Learn to ask your parents for money, just like college kids. Creativity is key - for example, "beer money" = "money for food" 20. Go to college parties, just wander in, grab a beer, and when people ask you who you know say john, when your asked which classes your in or similar questions, change the subject to "lets chug!". if you crash the same parties and incite the most drinking games, people will gradually just assume your part of the group and call you to let you know when the parties are.  21. When the bastards at McDs mess up your order at 2am, remember - you are unemployed, so go complain to their manager in the morning - what better do you have to do? 22. On a similar note learn what places are open all night. for a cheap cup of coffee to Denny's or IHOP. you meet cool people, and the coffee is bottomless - $1.50 per person. can't beat that. 23. If you smoke - you better have a source of cash, if you own a car - when the creditors call for the first time, make it look really nice, and sell it - you can'f afford it, but keep a key just incase - you can always find who you sold it to ... (if you steal your car back ... i didn't tell you to - so don't finger me) 24. Get a new set of clothes - undershirts, pajama pants, a robe, ect ... your not required to go out side and go to class - you can sit and watch tv all day 25. Shower after you wake up ... this ensures you shower atleast 6/7 days a week. 26. Play on things like an xbox - get sports games, especially baseball ones, they have 200+ game seasons, the game takes a while, and its laid back enough that if you go to the bathroom and then scrounge for food for an hour between pitches, the game never moves. 27. When you feel like stopping a project do it - you can contiunue later ... like im about to do with this (ok, i promise ill add to this, and revise it and one day put it all together ... not now though I have to jet off.

       Climb Up On That Ladder And Tame This Dog  One of my dad's current projects is to make the insane dog next door a little less insane. This was introduced to me with the phrase that I subtitled this lil blurb with. Yep, "Climb up on that ladder and tame this dog" was a command issued by my father. I think my response was something like "what?" but of course I was walking toward dad who had just put an 8 foot A-style ladder next to the fence.  The dog, of course, is barking it's head off. But it was doing that earlier, when we were just standing in the back yard. Dad talked to it calmly and offered it dog biscuits. But, really, he was still a big stranger on a ladder reaching into the dog's domain. The dog was a little quieter after a while. And was totally silent once dad got down from his perch after a few minutes. However, the dog wasn't interested in the dog biscuits. I tried a little bit of one while we were talking on the back porch. It's like if Playdoh made Bisquick, but with no salt. Crunchy though, but not meant for human consumption, so I only had a little. I Say Call In Johnny Fairplay! About the biggest train wreck of a reality show that's out now, well, no, it really isn't The Restaurant season 2. I guess Showbiz Moms & Dads is significantly worse, but I'm talking about The Restaurant here. Seems that Rocco is a born loser on the order of Jason Dill. Well, Dill has real talent but some serious personality and/or time management issues. I recorded last weeks episode since I saw what this weeks was supposed to be about. See, this weeks episode is when Rocco tried to take back Rocco's. Yes, Jefferey, the guy who shelled out four million dollars to build the place and has lost $600,000 in the four months it's been open, has brought his people in. Rocco's people and Jefferey's people don't work and play well together. Especially Jefferey's now-fired flakey kid who called Rocco "Captain Douchebag". Though kudos for that, but [makes Trump movement] Your Fired! But this week's episode didn't air. Even though it made Yahoo's TV Picks for that day, somehow it got yanked. Maybe it has something to do with the preview clip where an unbathed and desperate Rocco croaks out "Sherry...get me my lawyer..."  Oh, and Rocco's secret recipie for his mom's meatballs:  The Seattle Times: Food: Recipe: Chef Rocco Dispirito's Mama's Meatballs. In any case, it's better reality TV than voting on Ruprick getting a million for losing Survivor.    For those of you who think cats, and human abuse by soldiers, have NOTHING to do with one another...  Cat killers outrage a nation   By LLOYD JONES AGAINST a global backdrop of outrage against the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers, another military scandal angered Australians this week - the victims, four kittens. he litter of a stray cats was held captive in a residential section of Lavarack Barracks in Townsville during an Easter Saturday drinking session involving six members of an army support battalion. One kitten was dragged behind a motorcycle on a rope and then crushed under the tie of a 4WD vehicle, while the others were doused with fuel and set alight.  Talkback radio lines ran hot and letters to the editor baskets filled up with angry demands for the six Townsville-based servicemen to be discharged from the Australian Army. Many drew parallels with the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers in Baghdad. The six soldiers pleaded guilty in Townsville Magistrates Court on Monday to cruelty to animals and were each fined $2000, although convictions were not recorded against them.  Each of the soldiers, aged from 19 to 26, also offered to do 100 hours of community service at Townsville's animal refuge, an offer swiftly rejected by the RSPCA. The RSPCA called for the soldiers' dismissal from the army and for the sentences to be appealed on the grounds they were manifestly inadequate, when the maximum penalty available was a $75,000 fine. National RSL president Major-General Bill Crews joined calls for the soldiers to be discharged, saying they had disgraced the service. But Defence Minister Robert Hill said although the incident was horrible and embarrassing for the Australian Defence Force, the culprits' service record should be examined before discharge was considered. He said it was up to the soldiers' commanders to take any further action. Those commanders will make their assessments knowing that many Australians want the soldiers marched out of the army. In some letters to the editor, writers drew parallels between the treatment of the kittens and the torture of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison. "The Australian Army tries to tell us that Australian soldiers would never be involved in the kinds of humiliation and torture that US and British soldiers have perpetrated on Iraqi prisoners," Betty McLellan wrote to the Townsville Bulletin. "Violence is violence, whether the victim is a little kitten or another human being, and those who perpetrate gross acts of violence against animals and brag about it later are capable of anything." Margie Rowe wrote to the Canberra Times that the soldiers' actions made her sick. "I assumed they would be discharged from the army, as well as facing criminal penalties, but ... I find their records will be reviewed and a determination made as to whether they remain in our defence forces. "Unbelievable. Cruelty to animals is well established as an indicia of sociopathic behaviour and is common in the background of sadistic serial killers. Imagine what this lot would do if they were in Iraq." A similar point about sociopathic behaviour was made by RSPCA national president Hugh Wirth, who in a letter to Senator Hill urged that the soldiers be discharged.  Commander of 3rd Brigade at Lavarack Barracks, Brigadier David Morrison, said he shared the public's indignation over the torture of the kittens, which he described as disgusting. He said the soldiers would have to show cause why they should not be dismissed from the army.

      Quote of the day:  I need a break: hit the cream cheese- Eliza, the foreign exchange student from Italy.         Today's aphorism -- for you, for life, for everyday living: "Everything looks better with rhinestones. Everything. Darling!"    "HELP ME!! I'M SO BEAUUUUUTIFULL!"  I'm a product of my own twisted, mangled, smoking-gun, train-wrecked environment. I tried not to watch. I really did. But it was just like filing slowly past a fatal car accident bad enough to stop 5 o'clock rush hour traffic in Atlanta. I tried as hard as I could not to look. But at the last moment, the very last moment, I turned to stare at the bloodstained sheet on the side of the highway. In less kind and gentle words, I watched "The Swan" on Fox.  What more can I say? If you don't know the premise of this reality show, I'll lift it from the site for you, so you can smolder in endless eternity with me: THE SWAN offers women the incredible opportunity to undergo physical, mental and emotional transformations with the help of a team of experts. Contestants must go through an intensive “boot camp” of exercise, diet, therapy and inspiration to achieve their goals. Each week feathers will fly as the inevitable pecking order emerges. Those not up to the challenge are sent home. Those who are will go on to compete in a pageant for a chance to become “The Ultimate Swan.”  Aww, that sounds so nice, doesn't it? I think I hear Tinkerbell... Each contestant has been assigned a panel of specialists -- a coach, therapist, trainer, cosmetic surgeons and a dentist -- who together have designed the perfect individually tailored program for her. The contestants’ work ethic, growth and achievement will be monitored. The final reveal at the end of each episode will be especially dramatic because it will be the first time that contestants will be permitted to see themselves in a mirror during the three-month transformation process. Two women will be featured every week and at the episode’s conclusion, one will go home and one will be selected to move on to the 1st Annual Swan Pageant. Don't be shy, Fox boys. They downplayed the biggest and best part of the whole transformation: Stripper implants and moose lip injections. Forget therapy, hun. Here's a brand new pair of double D's to turn that frown upside down.  Of course I just had to see how much lower things have sunk since the "The Littlest Groom" so behold, Fox found this show idea stuck to the bottom of his shoe and decided to serve it up steaming hot to you and me. Don't get me wrong: a tiny part of me wanted to see a girl cry so hard that her new nose fell right off. I know who I am, I'll admit that much. I wanted Human Jack'o'lantern. However... And at the end of the show, the women who've been deprived of a mirror for 3 months end up paraded through a line of their re-creators. As they look upon her new face and body with tears in their eyes, the applause seems to be for the woman, but really, it's for themselves. The curtain is drawn back and the women do the same thing: They clutch their faces and scream "OH MY GOD, I'M SO BEAUUUUUTIFULL!" And then they almost tip over like cows on their high heels, but the tightness of one woman's dress kept her standing til the end.  And now she just looks like The Grinch staring out of a Ho Suit. Oh well. What do I expect? This is all making Janet Jackson's boob look good. Actually, I have to take that back. This show is almost as disturbing* as watching a lab rabbit get sprayed in the eye repeatedly with aerosol hairgel. You know, it's for the good of the people. The beautiful people.  I will not be right with this show until they choose to deepen it thoroughly with one of the following options:  (1) The pageant is really not a pageant at all. Instead, the women are loosed into an outdoor arena in which they must fight each other to the death. Thanks to Kenny for this one. (2) They awake to find they have only one boob implanted, and must live on an island for 3 months in order to win the other boob. (3) I want a follow-up report show every 6 months, and no one can get a divorce or get a job at a stripjoint by the airport. (4) I could go on for days here, so anyone out there who'd like to send me an idea, I will post it with credits.  But in times like this, and more times than not, it helps me to ground myself after such a disturbed view like this. To read about simple people with simple lives, and I'm not talking about that show with Paris Hilton and her pitchfork-toting pals either. I mean people who know who they are, people with real conviction, who would never change a thing that would conflict with their personal, moral beliefs. People with less independent thinking going on than mine, in my sad, souless broadcasted environment. But really, why do I care because: I'M SO BEAUUUUUTIFULLL!!!! DEATH TO THE UGLY, THE POOR AND THE UNFRESH! *It's almost as disturbing, but since rabbits are inherently innocent and have more self-esteem than the average housewife apparently, then you know where I'll be on Monday nights: "Birds of America" by Lorrie Moore. Something of substance to read as I work my second job at a stripclub near the airport.    I am sick and I have the AP test...    Your nose is runnin’ And your eyes are red Your head is achin’ You’d be better in bed From the bottom of your fever To the throbbing in your toes You’ve got a cold You’ve got a cold  You’re searching madly To find a cure But the mercury’s rising To a hundred and four You’ve got a beauty, a bad-ass The mother of them all You’ve got a cold You’ve got a cold  Ain’t no use in fightin’ it Get into bed and try to sweat it out  Hot toddies won’t help you Warm blankets won’t sweat it out Inhalants just choke you Hot flushes will tell you Anyway you’ve got it Ain’t no doubt about it Nothin’ new about You can scream and shout it  Hot toddies won’t help you Warm blankets won’t sweat it out Inhalants just choke you Hot flushes will tell you Anyway you’ve got it Ain’t no doubt about it Nothin’ new about You can’t fight it  Foreign bodies in your Kleenex You’ve got no taste at all While your system is dyin’ The bugs are havin’ a ball You’ve got a beauty, a bad-ass The mother of them all You’ve got a cold You’ve got a cold   The lyrics from the 10cc song, "You've Got A Cold", appropriate for me today because, well, I've got a cold! Stuffed-up nose, irritated throat, chest congestion, and of course, that time-honored favorite, feeling all achy, run-down and wretched. Good news is, no good news! Bad news is, I have to go to the doctor at 10 tomorrow, and the AP exam today, some person that once to have a look at my house and address my complaint about them raising its value for the umpteenth time. Gonna try to get all the rest I can today, but first I'm gonna review comics and that AP book...

        Oh Lordy Lord, Lord Lordy McLordmuffin,    Thank you for the Wednesday we are having. It's cold, it's gray, and it's beautiful. I can see Sunday from here, but for now, it's a beautiful sight. Long week, short weekend. But I'll take it anyway. For the record, it's all sad and lonely here around the school without Scottshead. He went to Coachella. That dirty, rotten, stinky bass turd. But that's ok, I have my newfound fascination with Klausa Nomi to keep me busy. I'm fascinated. No, really. We watched "Urgh! A Music War" last night, and poor dead Klaus was ahead of his time. So far in fact that he could probably never really fit in anywhere in the concept of human time. To me, that's fascinating.  But then again, I was that weird kid who bought the broken toys in the store because I felt sorry no one would buy them. And finally... Hmm. I'm not exactly sure why the obesity rate is skyrocketing in America these days.  Maybe it's a mindset that doesn't just celebrate something's arrival every 17 years with a parade or just by observing wistfully, instead we figure out how to make tacos out of them. "The cicadas are comin' the cicadas are comin', grab a fork and some BUTTER!"   Today's aphorism, and another useless tagline from the past.  " Say what you will about professional killers, they get their 'To Do lists' done." "Ball Park Franks. They plump when you cook 'em."  Remember, kids. Someone got paid for writing that tagline. Maybe it was Darrin Stevens right after Mr. Tate died and the Associate VPs cleaned house, firing Darrin after 20 years of his blood, sweat and tears, only to replace him with a cheaper, fresher *ad jockey*. Advertising doesn't make you bitter. No, really.  Aw, life is good, and not all advertising is bad for you, as long as you can handle the truth -- so here's a piece of candy that'll rot somebody else's teeth for a change and not yours.  Enjoy! Ps: As always, your aphorism contributions are welcomed here. If I can only remember to check my email. Must... remember..   M&M's are cruelty-free.  Things that make me a frownie-puss:  -- hitting the ground running -- being asked what is on my plate -- 004dk.eos.net.FtpError: login error messages -- hurting someone's feelings. unless i really can't stand them. -- being allergic to serotonin reuptake inhibitors in this day and age -- hearing the words "frownie" and "puss" used together by an adult -- the word "giggly"   Things that make me a giggly-fool:  -- thinking about owning a cheese shop with an adjacent wine bar -- eating an ice cream cone under the Eiffel Tower -- being fitter, happier, more productive -- red, green, yellow and blue M&Ms -- Christine, for fixing the 004dk.eos.net.FtpError: login error -- sitting in the middle of 5,000 people singing Weird Al's "Amish Paradise"* -- sitting in the middle of 5,000 people singing Weird Al's "Fat"** -- sitting in the middle of 5,000 people singing Weird Al's "Yoda"*** *Sometimes life is good. **But it's better when it's *** really good.   Rescue?  The average ambulance response time is ten minutes and forty-nine seconds. From the moment the call is routed through to emergency medical services, to the arrival on the scene, it takes ten minutes and forty-nine seconds. Turning over the engine, pulling out onto the street, using a radio transmitter to change red lights green, and traveling an average of fifty-eight miles an hour. Ten minutes and forty-nine seconds. Remember that number, because that is how long you will have to hold on to your life. That is exactly how stubborn you have to be in order to survive a car crash. An overdose. A heart attack. Every minute that passes by reduces the survival rate of a cardiac arrest patient by ten percent. Every minute you are laying on the ground unconscious, you are one tenth closer to death. Electrical signals start sending themselves more rapidly to your heart, causing it to run a race it can't win. It begins to limp along, and you lose vision momentarily. Parts of your body begin to feel strangely surreal. Arrhythmia sets in and your heart trips over its shoelaces, refusing to get back up off its knees. You collapse in your kitchen, your bathtub, your patio. If you're keeping track, the average ambulance on the average day with the average patient ends in an average funeral. When your lungs collapse from a sudden blow to the chest, cardiac arrest sets in. Electrocution, drowning, choking, and sudden blows to the heart. Ten minutes and forty-nine seconds after you forgot to turn the power off at the breaker box, the ambulance arrives at your household and puts you on a gurney. For the entire ten minute ride back to the emergency room, they send electric pulses through your chest, attempting to restart your heart artificially. Deus ex Machina in full effect, flying down the road at sixty miles an hour. When you arrive at the emergency room, a doctor and three nurses spend another four to six minutes attempting to shock you back to life. After the required number of attempts, the doctor pronounces time of death and signs off on your life. We are brought into this world with a certificate, it seems only fitting that we leave with one.

       ... ha ha ha ha ... Note to self:  Change phone number and find other employment ... Liberia, perhaps. Note to file:  Baiting and switching is seriously under-rated. Kelly:  Congratulations, my friend.  I bow to your courage which is superior to my own.  Today's aphorism, and another useless tagline from the past.   "Bring a sequinned hat and make a little money."  "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature." It's one of those days when I have nothing to say. I mean, like, absolutely nothing to say. It'd be nice to have at least one thing to say, but no. I got nothin'. See? Oh well. The cat scratched my eyelid the other day and lived to tell the tale. I think it was because my eye was twitching in my sleep. I'm sure that twitch has nothing to do with me.     Your yoga stretch for the day.  Sit up straight, knees slightly apart. Clasp your hands together, and put them between your knees. Next, push your shoulders up and begin curling your upper body over to stretch out your spine, then squeeze your elbows into your waist, as if you are cold. Keep curling until you can't curl anymore, comfortably. As you enjoy the stretch, you will hear something similar to the breaking of a stick of chalk, a quick grind and snap in your neck. Oh muther @#$%ing ouch, that really hurts. So never mind then, don't try this at home alone.   Ayyyah!  The United States Supreme Court today will consider the case of the Pledge of Allegiance, or, more specifically, whether the phrase “under God” in the pledge violates the country’s Constitutionally-mandated separation of church and state. I am not at all certain why the Supreme Court is taking up the matter, as it doesn’t appear that the Pledge was ever mandated by any municipal, state or federal law. Nevertheless, I refuse to recite the Pledge ... although the reasons aren’t premised entirely upon my disdain for organized religion.  On April 19, 1942, in response to war-time hysteria brought about by the allegedly surprise bombing by Japanese imperial forces of Pearl Harbor, then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the forced removal of 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast of the United States. The Order decreed that anyone with as little as 1/16 Japanese blood was subject to evacuation, and that they leave their residences within 48 hours taking only what they could carry by hand. For the duration of the war, life for these evacuees would be eked out in a 10’ x 20’ space in tar-paper barracks, strategically located on the most desolate lands of the U.S interior, including Death Valley. But despite the fact that not one individual of those imprisoned was ever been found guilty of a war crime or espionage, the Supreme Court determined that the U.S. government acted properly. That random abrogation of Constitutionally-guaranteed civil rights -- just one of many in the U.S. and all for no better reason than unfounded fear -- demonstrates unequivocally that neither loyalty oath nor pledge will save my ass from the whim of government or its God.

From A Brief History of Haiku, D.Russell   Super size it!  Have you ever noticed how much our society is obsessed with SIZE? EVERYTHING boils down to SIZE. We have sizes for everything. There's your shoe size, your underwear size, your pants size, and shirts. There's trial sizes, family sizes, econo sizes, super sizes, travel sizes, bulk sizes, and bonus sizes. You can't go on an airplane with out the right size carry-on bag. You can't buy a car without deciding what size you'd like. We're obsessed with size. Size can be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on your view. Some big guys like my size; most of them say my size is too big. You're evaluated by the size of your breasts (if you have them), your various other private parts (if you have them). Size is a descriptor, often used in a derogatory way. You describe people like "the skinny guy with the big ears", or the "big fat blonde chic with the too small blouse." It's all about size. People like to try things on for size, choose the right size, and eat the right-sized portions in their diet. If given the chance, most people choose the smallest-sized laptops, but the largest-sized screens for their desktops. They resize and upsize digital photos, and resize their computer desktop windows. Companies know that it's all about size. They know that the smallest decrease in the size of a product can lead to a great increase in the size of their profits. Coke cans used to not be dented in at the top, but a straight tube. That small difference in size let Coke save money on the aluminum used to make the can. Lumber is the same way. A 1X3 board is not actually one inch by three inches at all, but closer to three-quarters of an inch by two-and-a-half inches. Companies also cut costs by down-sizing. What's up with all this emphasis on size? Speaking of wood, some sizes have become standards, for varying reasons, even if that actual size is not equal to the size in name. Two by four pieces of wood are not actually 2X4. You haven't thought about the size of the spiggot on your outdoor water faucet, or your hoses lately. They're all the same size. We have paper sizes, like letter, legal, and tabloid. We have sizes for rolls of toilet paper, so they fit on our holders. There's sizes of pans in the kitchen, and sizes of eggs to fry in those pans. We have garbage bag sizes, and the size of those covers on our light switches. We assume when we buy gas, that the size of the pump nozzle, will be the appropriate size to fit in the opening of our car. And we pull into the drivethrough or roadway, and assume the size of it will accommodate our vehicle. The whole world is wrapped up in size. Without size, we'd come to a grinding halt, almost immediately. People couldn't advertise their size, or that of their products. They're be no "bigger", "longer", "smaller", or "miniscule". Our clothes wouldn't fit, but nobody would care what we weighed. Size would be gone. And with it, our way of life. So, size is where it's all. Now, take a big breath, and together, let's all release, our sighs...   4 entries found for jealous. jeal•ous ( P ) Pronunciation Key (jls) adj.   Fearful or wary of being supplanted; apprehensive of losing affection or position.  Resentful or bitter in rivalry; envious: jealous of the success of others.  Inclined to suspect rivalry.  Having to do with or arising from feelings of envy, apprehension, or bitterness: jealous thoughts.  Vigilant in guarding something: We are jealous of our good name.  Intolerant of disloyalty or infidelity; autocratic: a jealous God.   Is jealousy important or stupid? I mean, it definitely requires a lot of emotion, which means something. It either means a) you're a psychopath who needs to get over yourself or b) the person you're jealous over really evokes these important emotions from you, which in turns means you really care for them. I guess jealousy reflects love (or strong positive feelings  :p) as long as it's handled correctly. So... if someone is not jealous? Does that make them emotionless? Does it mean they don't care for you? Or does it simply mean they are levelheaded? Weird...but um.. yeah! I think I am jelous of something that I can’t control. YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! Lucky me!
