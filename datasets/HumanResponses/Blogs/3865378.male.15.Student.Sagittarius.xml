      OMG! An Iron Man Match between Benoit and The Game! And it's next Monday night! &nbsp;   GETTING THE EDGE     July 19, 2004      Edge took a page out of the Evolution playbook Monday night, beating Randy Orton for the second straight time with a nifty backslide and a little leverage from the ring ropes.  The Legend Killer hoped to reduce the five-time Intercontinental Champion to another T-shirt statistic, and he seemed a three-count away after a low blow and an RKO. But a groggy referee was slow to make the count, and Edge mustered enough energy to barely kick out. When Orton went to his finisher again, Edge reversed it into a winning — and slightly illegal — pinning predicament.  While the fans in Washington were treated to a highly competitive Intercontinental Championship defense, those live in Pittsburgh next week will witness the biggest RAW contest of the year.   In a 60-minute Iron Man Match that begins promptly at the top of the hour, Chris Benoit will defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Triple H. Whoever scores the most decisions in the allotted time will walk out with the title. But one question remains: Can the Crippler even walk after the vicious beating taken at the hands (and feet) of Batista? Early in Monday’s Benoit-Batista bout, it was clear that the Evolution member was taking his cues from The Cerebral Assassin. Rather than even attempt a cover, Batista simply continued to assault Benoit with illegal chokes and skull-crushing kicks. Batista repeatedly defied the referee’s orders while Benoit was tangled in the ring ropes, eventually leaving the official no choice but to call for a disqualification. The attack continued after the bell, punctuated by a ring-jarring Batista Bomb. Unable to walk under his own power, Benoit had to be helped from ringside. It was just what The Game ordered only seven days before a championship match of epic length.  The animal Batista also made his presence felt during a match between Kane and Chris Jericho — leveling Y2J with an all-too-familiar whirlwind clothesline. Capitalizing while deep in the D.C. crowd, Kane covered Jericho for the “Falls Count Anywhere” victory.  Jericho appeared to have earned a count-out victory early on, but a resentful RAW General Manager had different ideas. Eric Bischoff wasn’t the least bit amused after a Jericho prank led to the Diva hopefuls trashing Bischoff’s office. So, he seized the opportunity to get back at Y2J by ordering the match vs. Kane to continue with the unusual match stipulation.  After watching the 10 Diva Search finalists strut their stuff and tear apart Bischoff’s office, which one gets your heart rate revved up? Take a closer look through WWE.com and be sure to vote for your favorite before time runs out.

        ANGLE'S A FRAUD      July 15, 2004      WWE Champion JBL retained his title in a Steel Cage Match Thursday night, but the bigger story was who gave him a crucial assist: SmackDown! General Manager Kurt Angle.  Angle, who earlier in the evening said he’d likely be wheelchair-bound for life, made a shocking and all-too-physical appearance during the match between former champion Eddie Guerrero and JBL. As the masked El Gran Luchadore, Angle scaled the 15-foot-high cage, grabbing Guerrero and holding him long enough for JBL to escape for the victory. Eddie succeeded in unmasking Angle before he could make his getaway, revealing Angle to be a fraud and trickster with an unnecessary leg cast and wheelchair.   Angle promised that this would be “a night no one will ever forget.” But at the time he seemed to be referring to his plans for John Cena — not the night’s main event in which the WWE Championship was decided in a Steel Cage Match for the first-ever time on SmackDown!  Before donning the garb and mask of a Mexican champion, Angle made a big-time match for next week: John Cena vs. an infuriated Luther Reigns. Angle also placed Cena in another unfair situation — an Elimination Handicap Match against Rene Dupree, Booker T and Kenzo Suzuki. Cena managed to eliminate two of his opponents, but Booker T finished him off after getting a little help from Luther Reigns. With the big win, is Booker T first in line for the vacant United States Championship?   Earlier, Spike Dudley got some unsolicited help from the Dudleys during a tag-team match. The Dudleys seemed quite pleased until D-Von lost to Paul London one-on-one. With the rollup victory, London stated his case that winning the WWE Tag Team Championship with Billy Kidman wasn’t a fluke, after all.  Lastly, John Heidenreich revealed that he’s now aligned with the dastardly Paul Heyman. Only time will tell what influence Heyman will have on the young WWE Superstar.      Match Results:     Spike Dudley and Rey Mysterio defeat Chavo Guerrero and Jamie Noble    Booker T (eliminated Kenzo Suzuki &amp; Rene Dupree) def. John Cena (Three-on-one Handicap Elimination Match)    Paul London (with Billy Kidman) def. D-Von Dudley (with Bubba Ray Dudley)     WWE Champion  JBL def.

        BLOODY MONDAY July 12, 2004   When Chris Benoit raised the World Heavyweight Championship high after defeating Triple H at Vengeance, he couldn’t have imagined that he’d have to defend that title the next night on RAW … against Eric Bischoff’s nephew Eugene. When Eugene learned he’d be in Monday night’s main event, little did he know it was simply part of The Game’s vicious plan. And neither competitor expected to end the night bloodied and incapacitated at the hands of a third party.   The match began beautifully for the challenger. He avoided Benoit’s patented diving headbutt, later mimicking his opponent with German suplexes and even the Crippler Crossface. The Rabid Wolverine was clearly willing to do whatever it took to retain, ripping into Eugene with quick, stinging moves. But Eugene again caught Benoit using other Superstars’ attack arsenal, hitting a Rock Bottom that came dangerously close to being the end. Benoit managed to get a foot on the bottom rope, but Eugene thought he won and went to claim his World title.   With the match still technically in progress, Evolution descended upon the ring. It was perfect timing for Triple H and Company, as Benoit was down and Eugene was celebrating. Soon, the contest disintegrated into a barbaric beat-down. When Evolution had their fill with Benoit, they turned their full attention to tearing apart Eugene. Randy Orton hit an RKO. That was followed by a Batista Bomb. And worst of all, Eugene’s “favorite wrestler” blasted him with a Pedigree and left him an unconscious mass of crimson.   Besides taking his turn beating up Eugene, Ric Flair also found time to school The Hurricane. Flair weathered an early storm from his young opponent, who even managed to draw first blood. But that seemed to incite the “Nature Boy,” who took over in signature fashion. He isolated The Hurricane’s leg, setting up a Figure Four Leg Lock from which there was no escape.   Fellow Evolution member Batista had no such luck against the new Intercontinental Champion Edge. The animal dropped everything but the kitchen sink on the five-time Intercontinental Champion, but Edge’s resourcefulness saw him through. When Batista went for his high-impact spinebuster, Edge rolled him up and grabbed the top rope for leverage. The illegal advantage went undetected by the referee, and Batista lost in what could be considered poetic justice after Batista’s controversial Vengeance win over Chris Jericho.   The Lita-Kane-Matt Hardy saga spilled over into Jericho’s Highlight Reel on Monday night. In the end, Lita told off Kane and Y2J infuriated the monster into an impromptu match. Kane clearly was more interested in taking out his frustration than winning, opting for a DQ-causing low blow — just because he could.   Lita wasn’t the only pretty face on Monday Night RAW. Trish Stratus watched as Tyson Tomko beat Maven, and three Diva hopefuls were interviewed by a very pleased Jerry “The King” Lawler.   Match Results:    Intercontinental Champion  Edge defeats Batista (non-title match) Rhyno (with Tajiri) def. Robert Conway (with Sylvain Grenier) Tyson Tomko (with Trish Stratus) def. Maven (with Nidia) Chris Jericho def. Kane (DQ) Ric Flair def. The Hurricane The match between  World Heavyweight Champion  Chris Benoit and Eugene ends in a no contest

Triple H asked him what was the matter and Eugene said that he just talked to Chris Benoit. Triple H said that Benoit is a liar and he makes him sick. Triple H said Benoit does not want to be Eugene's friend. This is the same Benoit that hit him with a chair and the same Benoit that punched you last week, so Benoit is a liar, and Triple H is going to put and end to Chris Benoit tonight. Triple H said Evolution are his friend, not Chris Benoit. Triple H said let's think about something happy, and Triple H said he has a huge suprise for Euegene. Triple H sent Ric Flair to get Eugene's surprise and it was a Nature Boy robe! Eugene loved it and put it on and he was clearly very happy with it!

Triple H writhed in pain but clawed his way to the ropes, but Benoit dragged him back to the middle of the ring until Triple H finally made it to the ropes.  Benoit hit the German Suplex on HHH twice and then held on and hit the third. Benoit singalled for the end and went up top but Triple H rolled to the outside of the ring and Benoit jumped through the middle ropes with a suicide dive onto the Game sending both of them into the barricade. The referee got knocked to the outside and then HHH hit a DDT on Benoit and then shouted for Eugene and signalled for him to come out!  Eugene made his way down the aisle looking nervous, as Triple H pointed at the referee. Benoit then locked in the Crossface on Triple H as Eugene looked on from outside and Benoit was yelling at him to get the referee and Eugene didn't know what to do! Triple H began tapping out but the referee was still down as Eugene made his way up the steps and went to get in the ring and Benoit nailed him, and he can't take any chances in this match. Eugene looked upset as Benoit looked on, and then Triple H scored with a low blow and then hit the Pedigree on Benoit and told Eugene to get the referee, which he did.   Eugene shoved the referee back into the ring and Benoit kicked out at the last possible moment! Triple H told Eugene to get him a chair, and Eugene handed it to the Game. TripleH went to hit Benoit, but Eugene grabbed the chair, and then Triple H pie faced him off the apron. Benoit then kicked the chair right into the face of the Game and picked up the chair and Triple H was begging off. Ric Flair came down and was hit with the chair, as was Batista. Eugene got into the ring and told Benoit not to use the chair. Triple H then kicked Benoit in the lower extremities and picked up the chair, but Benoit gave him the low blow!  Eugene got into the ring and picked up the aprin and was going to hit Benoit but he changed his mind and then went to hit Triple H and changed his mind and went back to Benoit and then Triple H again and then Benoit tried to grab the chair for him but Eugene would not let go. Triple H got up and Benoit let go of the chair and Euegen hit Triple H in the head with the chair by mistake! Both men got to their feet and then Benoit rolled up Triple H to retain the World Heavyweight Championship!!   Winner, and still World Heavyweight Champion, Chris Benoit   Benoit made his way to the back with the title and Eugene looked very upset on the outside at what he did to Triple H. Triple H came to his senses and was holding his head in pain and Benoit stood proud as the World Heavyweight Champion! Triple H then turned his attentions to Eugene and gave him an evil glare and Eugene was saying sorry, and he was near to tears. Triple H shouted abuse at Eugene as Vengeance went off the air!

        COLD NIGHT IN CANADA July 8, 2004     Winnipeg, Manitoba, was a tough place to be a title holder on Thursday night. WWE Champion JBL was deceived, United States Champion John Cena was stripped and the 18-time tag champs fell to a couple of crisp, counterattacking cruiserweights.   After months of trying to wrestle the United States Championship away from Cena through a steady diet of difficult matches, General Manager Kurt Angle finally succeeded — by taking an out-of-the-ring shortcut. Angle vacated the belt after Cena defied previous warnings and put his hands on the SmackDown! GM. But it might be worthy to note that at the time, Cena was battling his scheduled opponent, Booker T, as well as enforcer Luther Reigns, a cane-wielding Angle and fiery Kenzo Suzuki. A Reigns sneak-attack and powerslam left Cena writhing in the ring; Angle’s proclamation added insult to injury.  After nearly losing the WWE Tag Team titles on Velocity, The Dudleys were wary of the courageous tandem of Paul London and Billy Kidman. They isolated London in classic Dudley fashion, using their superior size to grind down the challenger. But both London and Kidman proved far more resilient than expected, eventually turning the tables on D-Von and Bubba Ray. With a WAZZUP! headbutt of their own, the challengers began building momentum. When a London crescent kick set up Kidman’s patented Shooting Star Press, we suddenly had an upset special. The new WWE Tag Team Champions were met with a hero’s welcome backstage, and surprisingly, they even received a congratulatory handshake from the beaten Dudleys.  WWE Champion JBL hand-picked another opponent Thursday, seemingly ensuring a smooth path to next week’s Steel Cage Match with Eddie Guerrero. Promising a “champion vs. champion” competition, JBL brought out a Mexican title holder, El Gran Luchadore. Just as planned, JBL dominated with power moves. But when he tossed El Gran Luchadore to the outside, things quickly got interesting. The masked Mexican Superstar switched with an near-identical wrestler under the ring — one who could hold his own with the WWE Champion. Suddenly, JBL had his hands full with his opponent. And before he could fully sort out the circumstances, El Gran began to strut just like Latino Heat! After finding himself on the wrong end of the “Three Amigos” suplexes, JBL knew something was amiss and made for the entrance ramp. The familiar-sounding second Luchadore reminded JBL that next week, there will be no running from the Steel Cage.    Match Results:  Rob Van Dam defeats Mark Jindrak Paul London and Billy Kidman def. The Dudleys  (new WWE Tag Team Champions)  JBL and El Gran Luchadore wrestle to a no contest Chavo Guerrero/Akio/Jamie Noble def. Spike Dudley/Scotty 2 Hotty/Rey Mysterio (Six-man tag match) John Cena def. Booker T (DQ;  United States Championship vacated )

      Just saw Bad Blood, and I have to say, that was the best pay-per-view I've ever seen.  Here's a review I prepared while viewing the matches:   Bad Blood   June 13th 2004   Nationwide Arena, Columbus, OH   Bad Blood was spilt all over when two rivals busted each other in a Hell In A Cell and a champion himself had to become a monster to surpass the monster.  The 1st match was for the   World Tag Team Championship    Champions  La Résistance vs. Chris Benoit and Edge   This was a rematch granted by Eric Bischoff on the last episode of RAW, but you would see (even the announcers mentioned it) Edge fighting and being more involved in the match more than Benoit. Whether that was to rest himself before facing Kane later that evening remains to be seen. La Rez proved that they could defend their new World Tag Team titles against the team they defeated to win them, but the challengers almost turned the tables as Benoit locked the Crippler Crossface on Sylvain Grenier and Edge speared Rob Conway to throw him out of the ring.   Unbelievably, La Résistance kept their titles, but by disqualification, when Kane crashed the scene and attacked and chokeslammed Benoit and Edge.   Singles Match   Chris Jericho vs. Tyson Tomko w/ Trish Stratus   This was a typical 'David vs. Goliath' situation. Speed against power. Tomko is a physically dominating athlete, and this match showed how powerful he was as he threw Y2J from one side of the ring to the other. The tables turned when Tomko accidentally knocked Trish off the ring apron and Jericho, seeing the opportunity, did a sort of dropkick / drop toe hold mix to get the 1-2-3.   Intercontinental Championship    Champion  Randy Orton vs. Shelton Benjamin   Shelton completely dominated the match and blew Orton away. Everything that Randy could do, Shelton could do it better. The only reason he won was because of Ric Flair's dirty tactics and a handful of tights. Next time he won't be so lucky.   Women's Championship    Champion  Victoria vs. Gail Kim vs. Lita vs. Trish Stratus   This one was a very quick match, when Lita DDT'd Gail Kim the Champion seemed to be decided, if Trish didn't roll Lita all of a sudden to get the 3 count and to become the only 5-time Women's Champion.   Singles Match   Eugene vs. Jonathan Coachman   Eugene outsmarted and outwrestled the Coach, applying a Rock Bottom and a People's Elbow just before the pinfall, Stunning Garrison Cade after the match, and after that Stunning the Coach. I tell you, this kid has future.   World Heavyweight Championship    Champion  Chris Benoit vs. Kane   As the Bad Blood introduction said, 'To slay the monster, the champion must himself become a monster; to become the champion, the monster must evolve into pure evil.' Kane just dominated physically in this match, as Benoit could hardly stand up. Miraculously, the Rabid Wolverine threw a wrench in the gears of the Big Red Machine. While trying to apply the Crossface to Kane, he powered out by standing up, but Benoit immediately went for the other arm, and while Kane's knees fell, he turned around and pinned him with a half Nelson - cradle mix. And as he said while being interviewed by Todd Grisham after the match, he sure is for real!   Hell In A Cell   Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H   After years of clashes and rivalry, it escalated to this. When I saw this match, I thought anyone could win. But then again, the announcers did a good job by saying that Hell In A Cell produces not winners nor losers, but survivors. These two went at it for 47 minutes and 26 minutes, with chairs, tables, ladders, and the cell itself. The most famous rivalry in the history of the WWE ended with two straight Pedigrees. HBK and Triple H gave it their all and then some, so much that Evolution had to carry The Game out of the ring. Shawn got up a few minutes later, receiving a wild ovation. Good work Shawn.  And that's my review. Hope you enjoyed it.

      I know, I know, Vengeance is only in 4 days, but as of now I would like to post my match predictions:   Chris Benoit vs. Triple H   World Heavyweight Championship  I'm gonna predict Benoit the winner. I don't think a Pedigree would finish him, and he has made Triple H tap out to the Crossface in two house shows prior to Bad Blood.   Randy Orton vs. Edge   Intercontinental Championship  Here we go... Since nobody has announced Evolution was banned from ringside, I am perfectly seeing Ric Flair at ringside using his dirty tactics to steal victory from Edge. So Randy it is.   Chris Jericho vs. Batista   Singles Match  Ah, the typical 'David vs. Goliath'. I'm gonna choose Chris Jericho, and I predict Batista is gonna tap out to the Walls Of Jericho.   Ric Flair and Eugene vs. La Résistance   World Tag Team Championship  Eugene is a promising wrestler and Ric Flair a much more experienced wrestler than La Rez. I predict Eugene and the Nature Boy will come out on top.   Matt Hardy vs. Kane   No Disqualification Match  Unfortunately, I predict Matt is gonna be man-handled by the Big Red Machine. As much as I like Matt Hardy, I predict Kane is pulling an easy victory.  These are the announced matches for Vengeance as of today. There may be more, just like it happened at the Great American Bash from SmackDown!. Is that's the case, I'll edit this post in order to contain the new matches, if there are any.

      Eugene allied himself with Triple H and Ric Flair to take on Chris Benoit and Edge in a Handicap Match.   From RAW.WWE.com:    SPECIAL NIGHT July 5, 2004   Eugene may have been RAW General Manager for a day, but it was Evolution who ruled Monday night in Winnipeg, Manitoba.   In a Handicap Match ordered by Eric Bischoff’s nephew but orchestrated by Triple H, Evolution (including honorary member Eugene) took down the team of Edge and Chris Benoit. The bout was part of The Game’s master plan to wrestle the World Heavyweight Championship away from The Rabid Wolverine at Vengeance — and it seemed to be working. Evolution walked away victorious Monday, leaving Benoit unconscious and beaten in the ring. The Cerebral Assassin’s mental manipulation of Eugene also paid dividends, as a conflicted Eugene broke up a Sharpshooter and set up a match-ending Pedigree with a chair shot to The Crippler’s back.   Monday Night RAW opened in surreal fashion as a potpourri of Superstars got a taste of what Eugene was cooking up for his special night. Eugene’s first order of business was determining Randy Orton’s challenger for an Intercontinental Championship match later in the evening — usually a routine matter. Instead, Eugene whittled down the hopefuls to one through a game of musical chairs. The final two were big man Tyson Tomko and Winnipeg’s own Chris Jericho. To the delight of the crowd, Y2J “earned” the coveted match, sitting proudly in the sole remaining seat.   In the Intercontinental Championship battle that followed, Jericho gave Orton all he could handle. Y2J tagged the Legend Killer with a running enzuguri. Later he reversed an RKO attempt and locked Orton in the Walls of Jericho. But the looming presence of Evolution member Batista proved too distracting for Jericho, who released the submission hold to eliminate the outside threat. It was exactly the result Batista was hoping for, and he smiled coyly as Orton propped his feet on the second rope and rolled Y2J up for the three-count.   Thanks to Eugene, the animal Batista got a chance to show the world what he’s made of in a match against the Big Red Monster Kane. But an enraged Matt Hardy seemed to snap, erasing the match and slamming Kane’s head against the steel ring steps repeatedly. As a result, Matt Hardy will face Kane at Vengeance in a “No Disqualification” Match.   Eugene made plenty more news Monday. He took full advantage of his authority by making a Vengeance pay-per-view match — and putting himself in it! The team of “Nature Boy” Ric Flair and Eugene will face World Tag Team Champions La Resistance on Sunday.   This latest chapter in the life of Ric Flair must be utterly mystifying. The 16-time World Heavyweight Champion began the night playing musical chairs, then he was ordered to team with the uniquely talented Eugene in a pivotal match.   All the while, Flair is preparing for the imminent release of his eagerly anticipated and extremely honest autobiography, “To Be the Man”. Flair’s frank discussion of his career — and those with whom he’s crossed paths — is already creating a great deal of controversy. Flair also discusses his tragic youth, shedding light on some of the events that have molded the man. It’s required reading for all those who have followed his storied career and a page-turner for the members of every generation of wrestling fan.     Match Results:   Chris Jericho wins a Musical Chairs contest against Tajiri, Jonathan Coachman, Jerry “The King” Lawler, Stacy Keibler, Ric Flair and Tyson Tomko  World Tag Team Champions  La Resistance defeat Rhyno and Val Venis The match between Kane and Batista ends in a no contest when Matt Hardy interferes  Intercontinental Champion  Randy Orton def. Chris Jericho Nidia def. Victoria and Molly Holly in a “Contract on a Pole” Match  Women’s Champion  Trish Stratus (with Tyson Tomko) def. Nidia Eugene, Ric Flair and Triple H def.
