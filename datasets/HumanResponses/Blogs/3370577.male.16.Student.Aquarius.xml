      Remember about two years ago when Nintendo released that amazing game trailer of Link battling arch-enemy Ganondorf? Remember how disappointed you were when they scrapped that idea in favor of the cel-shaded look? Not to say that Wind Waker wasn't a good game, but I know I held onto that hope that a sequel to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask would be made.  Nintendo has answered our prayers.  E3 held many surprises this year, but none of them stirred so much commotion as the unveiling of a new Zelda game that has been kept absolutely secret until now. The game trailer that was shown featured a new adult Link, done in the style of Ocarina of Time, riding, shooting, fighting...   The graphics looks absolutely amazing. Link has NEVER looked better. I have watched the trailer several times now, and it still gives me the chills. This game looks so amazing, I'm willing to bet money on it... that is, if I had any money.   I will defenitely be keeping an eye on this game. And I will most defenitely keep you updated on it. To watch the trailer, head over to www.gamespot.com. You will not be disappointed.

       Type:  movie  Genre:  action  Good:  originality  Bad:  somewhat nonexistant story  Enterview Rating:  7.5  Description:   Kill Bill Volume 1 is the fourth film by sick genius Quentin Tarantino. As is to be expected from a director such as Tarantino, this movie is filled with blood, gore and violence. The beginning of Kill Bill shows Uma Thurman's unnamed character lying beaten and bloody on the floor. We watch as the mysterious Bill calmly strides up, explains his reasoning for killing her, and shoots her in the head with a single bullet.   And that's all we see of the plot for a while. We watch and wince as Uma and a former comrade kick the living crap out of each other in a living room, breaking glass coffee tables and flipping shelves and tables over. Get used to these scenes, people. After this first fight scene, the remainder of the movie is a flashback in which Uma's character awakes from a three-year coma with a lust for revenge. Bill and friends crashed her wedding and someone's got to pay.   Six people, actually. Uma decides to kill the six assassins present at the wedding massacre, and she writes them (color-coded) on a yellow pad of paper so she won't lose trak. And that's where the plot hits a road block. The remainder of the movie consists of Uma's character tracking down the first assassin on her list, played by Lucy Liu.  We recieve a taste of storyline when Uma tracks down the legendary swordsmith Hitori Hanzo and he makes her a katana of the finest steel. This sword will taste a lot of blood by the end of the movie. Uma finds the assassin and her posse at a Japanese restaurant. After cutting off the arm of her secretary and letting her spray gallons of blood in a disgusting torrent, Uma sets about killing all 88 of Liu's guards. And that's where I lost interest.   The beginning of the fight scene is exciting and gripping and had me on the edge of my seat. But by the last few guards, we pretty much know she's going to win without problem. I mean, come on, she's killed 60 guys already, what's 28 more? Seriously.   Anyway, Kill Bill Volume 1 is twice the violence and none of the plot. But that's what Volume 2 is for, right?

       Type:  movie  Genre:  action  Good:  it's relatively short  Bad:  ridiculous storyline  Enterview Rating:  3.5  Description:   I went into Walking Tall not expecting much. And the honest truth is, I should have set my expectations lower. Walking Tall is in fact a remake of a 1970's action flick starring Joe Don Baker as a returning soldier named Pusser. Sound like a recipe for disaster? Yeah, it get's better. Joe Don's character will be reprised by none other than bulky meat-slab The Rock. Now, don't get me wrong, The Rock does possess potential acting talent (he was quite good in The Rundown), but if he wants me to take him seriously, he needs to get a real name.   The Rundown starts out okay, as The Rock's character returns to his hometown and is reunited with his family and friends. And surprise, a casino opened up while you were gone and now the town's a wretched hive of scum of villiany. Sorry about that. The Rock, of course, beats up a bunch of guys because the dice at the casino are loaded. And they take an exacto knife and cut him up. But hey, the only thing chicks dig more than muscles are scars, right Rock?   Nah, he decides to grab a two-by-four and beat up some  more  guys. Then he is proclaimed innocent at court and elected sheriff... now, at this point in the movie, I started thinking that maybe this wasn't the most believable flick. It gets worse.  Once he becomes sherrif, the Rock fires everyone else on the force and elects his dumb "comic-relief" buddy to be his only deputy. After engaging in more ridiculous, highly-illegal actions, the Rock beats up some more guys... and that's when I stopped paying attention.  Walking Tall is quite possibly the dumbest, most violent-for-no-reason, ridiculous movie I've seen all year. Every scene is a mockery of the police force. In stead of watching a prisoner like he should be doing, the Rock starts making out with his girlfriend because she brings him some tupaware with potato salad inside. Now guess what, your car exploded and they're standing outside the office with machine guns.  Now, it helps a bit that the bad guys in this movie have such terrible aim that they hit everything except the Rock, and that the Rock is able to shoot and kill people he can't see through walls, but it'll still be a tough fight, right? Not really. I never feel like the Rock is really in danger. He's three times as big as any guy in this movie, and could easily take five or six of them with no problem. I never feel sympathy for any of these characters.  And so many potential plot points are totally forgotten. The relationship with his troubled nephew is completely disregarded halfway through the movie, and the Rock's past military woes are only hinted at and then forgotten. I feel like the filmmakers just got lazy.  Take my advice, rent the original Walking Tall. It's Joe Don Baker's only good movie, so give him a break. If you're itching for some Rock action, watch The Rundown. But you're not missing much of anything if you don't see Walking Tall.

       Type:  movie   Genre:  horror/action/modern fantasy  Good:  great special-effects  Bad:  weak story  Enterview Rating:  6.0  Description:   Van Helsing has taught me two things. One: A totally awesome-looking movie can turn out to be mediocre. And two: everyone in Transylvania is a trapeze artist. Seriously, this movie should be more aptly titled. I suggest “Rope Swinger,” or “Van Helsing and the Amazing Appearing Ropes.” This movie is almost overwhelmingly drenched in cheesy scenes where one of our characters swings across a great expanse on a rope while the music swells to indicate adventure. Adventure? What’s so amazing? Apparently, everyone in the country is quite skilled at swinging on ropes. And there seems to be a constant supply of conveniently placed rope everywhere in Transylvania.   But enough about ropes, you’ll get your fill if you see the movie. Van Helsing is entertaining, despite the rope acrobatics. The special effects are very well done and they blend almost seamlessly with the live-action. And speaking of action, the fights are also very good. Van Helsing battles such legendary creatures as Mr. Hyde, the Wolfman, and Dracula.   However, it’s a bit confusing and mind-boggling how and why these creatures all came together. I know there was something about a plot Dracula had for bringing his children to life, and he needed Frankenstein for some reason to do so. It seems as though the weak writing in this film was further weakened and overshadowed by the special effects and fight scenes.   And that’s exactly what Van Helsing is. It’s nothing but a brief, entertaining, special effects thrill ride. There is no compelling story or memorable characters. There really is no scenes that stick out in my mind, either. Van Helsing is by no means a bad movie, but it’s not a very good one either. See it once, enjoy it for what it is, and forget about it.

       Type:  video game   Genre:  action/puzzle  Good:  awesome gameplay  Bad:  occasional frustrating battles/puzzles  Enterview Rating:  9.0  Description:   In Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, you assume the role of the warrior son of the King of Persia. Prince is fast, agile, and strong, and his amazing arsenal of moves and attacks are at your disposal. The game opens to the Persian army laying siege to the city of the Maharaja. After entering the city and reducing it to ruins, the Prince sets out on his own to retrieve a prize worthy of his father’s admiration. After deftly disposing of several guards and scaling pillars and walls, you come across the Dagger of Time, which allows Prince to control the flow of time itself.   Prince unintentionally brings about the downfall of a kingdom with this weapon, releasing the Sands of Time to consume the entire palace, mutating its inhabitants into monstrous creatures that feed on hate and violence. Prince, seemingly alone, must defeat them all and return the kingdom to its former glory.   Throughout the game, Prince receives new powers to aid him in his quest to right his wrongdoing. Among these powers are the abilities to slow, rewind, and completely freeze time. These abilities are not only fun to use, but very original. Should you take a nasty hit during a battle, you can simply rewind time and watch as Prince flies up from the ground, his health restored. Battles are fluid and entertaining and require real strategy to win. Sometimes faced with overwhelming odds, Prince can divide his attacks to deliver blow after crushing blow to his surrounding enemies, eventually ending their suffering with the Dagger of Time, which absorbs the Sands of Time that created them.   The graphics are simply amazing. In all honesty, they’re some of the best visuals I’ve ever seen. Everything seems to glow in this game, giving you a very surreal feeling. The phenomenal graphics coupled with the nearly flawless camera make this a video game experience that should not be missed.  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an amazing game. The perfect balance of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving will keep a gamer entertained for hours upon hours. Do not miss this one, folks.

       Type:  movie  Genre:  action/disaster  Good:  amazing special effects  Bad:  plot, are you there?  Enterview Rating:  6.0  Description:   In the near future, as a result of our pollution of this world's environment, the polar ice caps will melt. As the ice caps melt, they will send billions of gallons of fresh water into our oceans. Because of this, there won't be enough salt in the water. And because there is no salt in the water, tornadoes, hurricanes, tidal waves, sub-zero temperatures and mad wolves will occur... WHAT?! Exactly. I'm not the most scientifically inclined person in the world, but I'm pretty sure the world wouldn't end if there wasn't enough salt in the ocean.   But that's exactly the plot of Day After Tommorow, the end-of-the-world disaster flick from the director of Independence Day (which wasn't a very good movie either). This movie is so chock full of cliches and stereotypes, I had trouble trying to find any hint of originality. There's the troubled scientist (played by Dennis Quaid) who also happens to be the only one who knows about the end of the world. Also, he's the troubled father who's gone on business all the time and the relationship with his son is suffering because of it. Two stereotypes in one character? I know, I had trouble believing it too.  Day After Tommorow is by no means a bad movie. The special effects in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen. Seriously, they're amazing. The shots of frozen Manhattan were so hauntingly realistic, I got the chills while watching it. But I think that the special effects were the only thing that kept this struggling ship afloat.

       Type:  movie   Genre:  action   Good:  amazing character development, special effects, and everything in between   Bad:  we need another sequel NOW   Enterview Rating:  9.5   Description:     No, that 9.5 is not a mis-type. Spiderman 2 is actually that good. Where the first Spiderman flick failed, the sequel has prevailed. Where all superhero movies since the first Superman have disappointed, Spiderman 2 does not. It is truly a milestone in film history, and hopefully a standard for upcoming superhero flicks (Fantastic Four, Ironman).     The first Spiderman film pitted the web-slinger against the increasingly insane Norman Osbourne, aka the Green Goblin. This time around, there's a new crazy scientist in town. Dr. Atto Octavius, when a fusion demonstration goes wrong, has a set of mechanical, intelligent tentacles fused to his spine. His wife is killed as a result of the experiment, and he goes mad.    We see a new kind of villian here. He is not inherently evil, nor is he totally in control of himself. He is a sad character, who only wishes to fulfill his dream. And we sympathize with him in that aspect. We almost wish his plan would work, just so he could be happy again, like he was prior to the experiment.     We also see Peter Parker, struggling to save the world and do his homework on a daily basis. He's stressed, confused, naive, and madly in love with a girl he could not possibly have. He's delivering pizzas to make ends-meat and living in a slum of an apartment with a Russian tennant who does nothing but whine for the rent. Oh, and he's losing his powers.     I never thought I'd feel sorry for Spiderman. I mean come on, he's muscular, he's fast, he's strong, he can scale buidlings, and he can soar through the sky with a mere flick of his wrist. But while watching this movie, I truly felt sorry for the character of Peter Parker. That's one of the marvels of the film.     The action and special effects (the frosting and sprinkles on the cake of plot and ice-cream of characters) are amazing in this film. The epic battles between Doc Ock and Spidey are phenomenal. You'll wince as Octopus tosses Spiderman effortlessely through a building across the street, and cringe as Spiderman beats past his mechanical terror tentacles to beat the living snot out of his face. There is so much passion and emotion in this fight scenes, because both men are fighting for their very fates and the fates of others.     Spiderman 2 is truly an amazing film. I don't doubt that it could be the first superhero film in history to be nominated for the Oscar. It is a movie that stands above the rest with a solid, interesting plot and characters, amazing special effects, pumping action, and enough romance to suit anybody's needs. If you haven't seen it, you should be shot. See it. NOW.

       Type:  movie  Genre:          horror/thriller              Good:    unique storyline, intriquing characters    Bad:    doesn't quite stack up to Shyamalan's previous films    Enterview Rating:    7.0    Description:   M. Night Shyamalan is a film genius. He knows exactly what shots to use, what lines to say, what mystery to reveal. He sprinkles his movies with little hints and clues, just enough to make the audience scream, "I knew it!" when the final twist occurs.  His movies make you think. And that is what I love about him.  The Village is his most recent venture into the world of horror filmmaking. It tells the tale of a utopian nineteenth century town that that was settled in a valley many years prior by a group of people known as the "elders." Life is perfect. There is no money, no violence, no hate. But there is one thing: fear. The small village is surrounded by thick, dense forests. And in these forests reside terrible creatures of myth. The people of the village are taught never to enter the woods, for fear of disturbing these creatures.  The plot of The Village is very unique and creative, unlike any movie I've ever seen. But The Village's strongest quality is found in it's cast of characters. Actors like Juaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver play major roles in this film. And all of them give excellent performances. Also making her film debut is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays a young blind girl named Ivy, who is infatuated with Lucious, Phoenix's character. Adrien Brody is also excellent as a mentally disabled young man who's only playmate is Ivy.  Though The Village doesn't quite live up to such films as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or Signs, it does have it moments.  Shyamalan tries a few new techniques, such as suddenly switching the focus of characters from Lucius to Ivy halfway through the film. Though most directors would fumble clumsily with a transition like this, Shyamalan does it in such a way that I didn't even notice until the end of the movie.  And of course, as a Shyamalan tradition, the film has to have a twist at the end. I do believe this is one of his best plot twists yet, to tell you the truth. My mouth was hanging open for a full five minutes before I realized. And though The Village is a sufficiently scary film, it lacks some of the thrills of the other films.  But I will admit to the fact that I did scream like a woman at one point in the film.  The Village is by no means a disappointment on Shyamalan's part. I would recommend any fan of Shyamalan or horror in general to go see this movie.
