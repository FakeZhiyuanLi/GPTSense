      Today was so boring....I go to school, period after period and bla bla bla.....But ______ is the one who make it from a boring day to the WORSEST DAY IN HELL. He is such a MORON. He tends to play with other people's father name without knowing whether the person like it or not. I admit that i like him at first becuz he is okey then. But now, after i have seen his attitude, i kinda HATE HIM TO THE CORE. Its just the why can't he just behave llike other sane human beings. It suits him if he is a quiet guy sitting at one corner doing his work. But now, things have chang. I don't like him anymore and nothing he does can change what i think about him anymore.....I am a serious person when it comes to relationships....BEWARE!!

      At last, i get to have a day to myself with my bestfriend, natasha at the mall.Or else, i would be at home watching television or doing my homewerk .We were shopping for THINGS, then, shazuan, natasha's SO CALLED "steady" sms her saying that he wanted to meet her at Afganistan. So, natasha said that she is with me at century sq doing some shopping. Den this is what he said, " ook, fine. Whateva. You alwayz listen to ur so called 'good friend'. WHO is he to say that to me. Natasha doesn't even like him, that GOOD FOR NOTHING JERK!! If i could, i would spit at his face that natasha is just using him..You gotta see the look on his face if i say this to him but i kept a promise to natasha to not tell him. So i kept my finers crossed. I HATE THE SIGHT OF HIM!! ARGH!!!!

      As you know, today is GOOD FRIDAY, and do you know what it means??......it means that today is a HOLIDAY, silly(to people who do not know what it means). I'm DYING of boredness.... I have nothing to do except to sit down on the couch and stare in to the television.. I can't be doing that all day right? so, i have asked my friends out but....THEY"RE ALL GOING SOMEWHERE with their families..It's totally unfair. and its all becuz of my grandmother..She is the most WEIRDEST granny in the whole entire universe. I dunno how to say it but she is just the ...WEIRD. Not only weird but irritating. my brother was sleeping so comfortably with his saliva coming out of his mouth in his bed at 6.58 p.m. suddenly, my granny shouted at him to wake up as seh said this, " ITS NOT GOOD TO SLEEP IN THE AFTERNOON". I mean whats wrong in sleeping. Everything my family and i do is wrong to her. She always wants us to follow her god damm way of doing things. As i've told you, IRRITATING!! I HATE MY LIFE!!!!

      Here's another one of my poem....  Betrayal Betrayal is hurtful and also the devil because it is always full of pure evil It lies within you...whether you want to make it happen or not it makes your stomach churn and always leaves a knot  Betrayal has no trust in it That's why couples were against it it leaves a hutful scar you'd be sitting there with your mouth ajar cuz your ties have broken with her regreting the days you spent together  Betrayal does not come like that It's you, it's YOU who make it happen.....

      HoLA everybody!! I am gonna introduce to you one of the love poems i wrote....Please enjoy them with the beutiful classical music... A Life With Love Love can be complicated yet, nothing is as beutiful as love love is also soft and delicate like the swaying motions of a dove  If you make one silly mistake your love is already at stake Betrayal and trust are the two sides undiscovered You would alyays end up unhurt or perhaps severed  Trust is earned not bought it is an obstacle made by two which their minds chose to be thought To trust somebody is not a difficult thing to do  As love always comes from the heart And nothing can make it depart...

I know it's not SUCHA GREAT NEWS but i feel verry happy becuz its been years since my family want out for an outing. I'm extremely overjoyed. But i have doubts too.....You must have wonder why does it take my family SUCHA long time just to go for an outing....dats bcuz, whenever we plan to go anywhere, we always end up NOT GOING..you get what i mean? They will find excuses that it is going to rain laa and all taht BULLSHIT!!! I hate it when that happens...dats why i prefer to go out with my frends more than my family. As you know, iam a very sensitive girl so i tend to get hurt easily. HAIZ.....wad a DARN life i have huh?
