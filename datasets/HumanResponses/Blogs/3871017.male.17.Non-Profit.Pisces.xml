      Tears flooded my eyes for a brief moment after reading this. Liau Wan Yee was from my school,CHS,13,1B1  PETALING JAYA: A lorry driver is believed to have strangled his three  children to death before taking his own life because he feared losing  custody of them if he filed for divorce.   Liau Kok Keong, 38, was found hanged with a nylon rope and his second  daughter, Wan Juan, 10, lying on a sofa in the living room of their home  in Serdang Raya.   His elder daughter, Wan Yee, 13, and son, Chen Liang, seven, were found  dead in separate rooms.   Wan Yee, who was still in her school uniform, had a rope coiled around her  neck.   It is learnt that Liau, who had separated from his wife two weeks ago, had  sought advice from a lawyer and was told that he might lose custody of the  children.   On Thursday evening, he bought a cake and held a small party for Chen  Liang, whose birthday is on Aug 6.   It is believed that he used a nylon rope to kill the children after the  celebration.

      Today was indeed a sad day at Catholic High School.  Firstly,during perhimpunan it was announced that Pn Sandy was retiring.NO she's not old,in fact she's young!Heard ppl say that her husband is pretty rich and she wants to spend more time with her family..aww... some teachers cried u noe!Well,she taught me sejarah last year,her notes are very good! anywayz, everyone was applauding Pn Sandy,indeed she is a popular figure in CHS.  Secondly,sadly,today my class made Pn Choo(my accounts teacher) cry ...sigh.This happened maily because someone didnt do her HW and copied someone else's.So in her tears,Pn Choo gave her thoughts and advises.The class was silent.It's been a while since our class has been this silent..Seems as if almost every teacher hates us now.english,mandarin,maths,science,accounts..   The worst thing happened after school.Me and my friends realize that some people were crying in front of block A and there were reporters asking them some question.we didnt noe exactly what happen.then later,robyn asked ming shiu and we found out that apparently a form 1 mandarin society girl from 1B1 was killed along with her siblings.apparently the parents were not on good terms.im pretty blur besides these info.hmm,i've alwayz read these kinda news in the newspapers or something,never imagine it'll happen to someone from my school.so sad..mebbe it'll be in the newpapers some time soon.  im pretty shocked..and i dont know what to say..i'll stop blogging here..

      choices,choices....so many choices to make in life.  talked to mum yesterday,and we were talking about the schools in melbourne. for those who dont know,i'll most probably be moving over there next year to do yr 11 n yr 12 VCE its like A levels but in school. first of all,we havent decided whether i should attend a goverment school or a christian(private) school. results,achievement,facilities wise its probably about the same. its just the students of the school.yeah probably the private(christian) school would be better,less international students eg:korean,chinese,indonesians,japanese and so on who are suppose to be a bad influence in aussie(becos their rich n they have bad habbits). and the teachers as well as students there would ALL be christian as well.other than that no significant differences.  on the other hand,if i were to attend a goverment school it would save quite a sum of cash! the fees for Donvale Christian College (where my good fren ken p. goes to)cost about 6000 aussie(its alot cheaper because i have PR in aussie means i'm counted as a local and pay local fees)which is about RM16000.but thats for one year.2 years whould be RM16000 X 2 = RM 32000. my mum is thinking whether we should save on that money and is it really worth it to spend it on the private school.  And after this school choosing process there's also a decision to WHEN i would fly off. you see,i've always wanted to go to RBS(residential bible school).for my batch,it will be from 30 Dec 2004,to 2 Feb 2005.school in melbourne starts on the 27th of Jan 2005.If i go to RBS,not only will i have to miss a week of school(not really a prob) but the big thing is that i will really have a hard and hectic time before and after RBS,in a sense that i got alot of things to do! like visiting relatives,frenz~duh!,shopping,packing n all that.and the timing is just terrible! mum sayz after RBS graduation(2 feb 2005,wednesday) i should fly off by the weekend! i was so shocked! SO FAST? my goodness...i was thinking mebbe a week or so first..  well,good news is mum says i can take my undang sometime soon.hope that i get it done and i can finish of my license by december so i can drive ASAP weeeeeeeeee.....

      Yea this is my 2nd post in the same day.  Just got back from BK cluz,and yea my BK exam results arnt good.i just managed to pass.I told my mum,she said it's quite good considering i'm doing 2 years work in 6 months.well,just in case some of you are wondering how did the others do,i noe 1 gal did better than me and 1 didnt,and the other guy(haha guess who) did worse than me,n i have no idea how the other 2 gals did,probably better than me.which means = my position in class is 3/4 outa 6?bermakna saya dalam tengah..not bad lah,since i joined late...actually i DO noe my stuff,serious! but to get the required marks are like really hard! u have 2 describe everything in the incident in detail! its like 1 sentence 1 mark! walauweh,darn hard to get marks...sigh,kinda discouraged now.seriously feel like dropping it..  Another thing is that since a couple of weeks ago i've started to find that the classes arnt as effective as it used to be.How?Why? i have no idea... this is getting me worried.if this is gonna continue,there goes my BK SPM down the drain... i really hope it doesn.  It just seems that the lessons arnt as 'effective','powerful' or 'meaningful' as it used to be..why!why!i used to really look foward to classes every week,as i would learn something new and something interesting.now its like having sejarah lessons.or is it because this part of BK is the more boring part?i really dunno...  Confused...

Remember, God's goodness to you as a personal experience... maybe retell a story? Definitely not a bible study on God's goodness! ;)'  yea God has been good to me in MANY many ways,but which part of my life would be suitable? roughtly thought of some but i'm not really comfirmed yet... aiseh this benny ah,he said 'this coming saturday' which means tomorrow la!!

      somehow today,i woke up only at 7.20am!when i got up,my bro was asking me:dont have school ah? and i was like...shiiitttttttttttt....so dashed in the bathroom,took a quick shower,packed my loreal remix into my bag and ran towards the bus station.2 mins later a bus came,BUT I DIDNT GO UP!i thought,since i'm already late,i my as well take the risk and wait for a taxi.sadly.. the taxi never came.so 15 mins later,i went up the next bus,and got to school only at 8.10.mr kean was there n i i thought he was gonna rotan me.he didnt!haha i was so pleased.but this is the 5th time i'm late this year,which means 0.1 marks will be deducted from my purata next term....crapppppp.. oh well,so my class was having PJPK so i went down to the reading corner..all the guys were already in their sports gear,and there was only 1 period left so i decided not to join them...yea i noe some of u are already amazed... i saw robyn sitting there(reading corner) so i went over n talked 2 her loh until PJPK was over.. nothing special abt school today,just an ordinary school day so i shall not blog abt the rest of the day.  after school though,we had this inter-class frisbee competition.for those who dont know,frisbee seems to be the latest craze in CHS.we dont throw it and chase it like a bunch of kids.this SPORT is something like american football.u have to catch the frisbee inside this box to score a point.if someone throws the frisbee to you and you miss,the frisbee is now in the opponent's possesion. so back to the point,my class lost to 5s2....we didnt exactly work as a team,we kept trying these long passes which obviously didnt work.i think we should have played in a 'line' or a 'v' and play short passes.bah...nvm we lost..so wat? anywayz after some time,i wanted to go home,so i told ken to go home,he asked wat time it was,i said 4(it wasnt,actually it was only 3.45),so after finding out the time he said:nah!!! so doesn this give u the impression he intends to go back with me at 4? so at 4.15 i asked him again to go home,you know what he said? 'go home urself la,i take taxi wan!' **WTF** so i had to walk all the way to the bus stop in front of University Hospital ALL BY MYSELF....thanks to you-know-who....the person who never fails to dissapoint me..  yea now i'm back home,and i got tuition later,so i gotta catch sum sleep.ciaoz!

      it started off badly.in a sense that i only woke up at 8.05 and that was because gabriel was calling my handphone.he was already waiting in his car with wen sze outside my house and i just woke up.this is unusual of me as i usually get up on time to go to church.so i told gabriel to go off without me.sorry gabriel. well as i was late, after getting ready n having a small munch.i rush myslef to the main road n waited for a taxi.after waiting for abt 10 min only did i get my taxi n off i was to church!  reached church about 8.45am(not bad weh!) n was forced to sit at the back(thats where all the late comers sit).and believe me! it wasnt pleasant.i could barely see the person sharing,n i could barely see the projection,i was forced to look at the small tv that was installed. barely anyone(who sat there) sings when we sing the songs,and very few of them actually turn to their bibles when someone is sharing a verse.this lady who was siting next to me is the worse...she doesn sing,she doesn use her bible,she doesn even pray when the church is praying! she just sits there n like dream or something...it saddens me to see people like this in church...cant they feel God's presense?i sure do... so trust me when i say its a terrible experience siting behind..its VERY DISCOURAGING! to all PJGH ppl,try not to be late cos it sux to sit behind!  anywayz there was a small shock during coffee hour as subang wanted to pull out of the friendly pretty last min. well at least they change their mind n showed up! the friendly was held at strike-5 futsal arena was pretty ok. even tho we finished 3rd n i played pretty little i think we did okay considering we didnt play with our full squad.most of our senior girls werent around n we had to make do with some junior girls and some newly promoted seniors. overall i think subang only won only cos it was a one man show =P,hey its true okay! ur girls barely do anything...and we played without many main girls!u guys only beat us 13-10..pretty narrow!but i must say, i think subang are the best led and organized team.. rojak did well cos all guys ma!! we did farely well with the limited players,although defense was pretty shaky.it shoudnt be a problem if li chen n barbara comes ss has improved.their passing is quite good.fast n smooth.but finishing still a problem for them tho.  parents came home n let me just say i wasnt in a good mood........

      Well,today i led worship in YF,was okay i guess,i didnt really shared much but i think i did a good job in the selection of songs.My theme was God's love n how we should respond.I could see that many youths were really singing with their hearts.M happy 2 see that.i even got feedback from some ppl(more than 1!!) haha well that really encourages me! thanks guys!  Well as u can see on the title i kinda had a mood swing day.During uncle bobby's class i was kinda down as if something terrible had happened.Actually nothing happened at all! i didnt even open my mouth until the end of the class!Well class was actually okay today..not too bad.We are still doing this character studies.and the lesson was on Esther.a poor orphan who became queen.Well the REAL lesson of the class was,no matter who we are,what we are,what we do,WE MUST DO IT WITH OUT BEST! because how would non-christians/believers noe what is christianity ALL ABOUT? we have to show them! and what better way to show them by reflecting our lives to them! well i did feel kinda bad in class. yea mainly cos im not ANYTHING that uncle bobby n keith said we should be,but i promise that i will try my best! Dear Lord Jesus,I know i have said this again n again Lord.But i must not give up.I must persevere n continue this race Lord.Father help me in this journey,i want to end it well.I want to reflect you Lord Jesus,to those around me,so that they might get to know you as well,and add to the body of your kingdom.Use me Lord as your tool.In Jesus name,Amen.  Later we went over to GT for captainball,yea was kinda fun altho the field was kinda muddy.later played street soccer n scored all goals with my header if i do say so myself.joel kicked my leg on accident.ouch..but its okay im used to it.but i ACCIDENTALLY made cassie's specs senget!! i think it was cos i was spiking the volleyball while defending...aiks..so sorry yea casie...see i cant sleep 2nite dee...will be feelings sooooo bad =P  And after captain ball/street soccer i sat on keith's car along wif hanj.We were talkin all about our fav football club-Manchester United.talkin abt the future,who should partner Nistelrooy,transfers n all that.as my parents arn home i joined keith n the older ppl(well their not exactly youth anymore) for dinner.was okay.  Well the highlight of the weekend has to be the Captain Ball Friendly 2molo.SJGC n SSGC are coming.I cant really say im excited n all that.the old n usual me would.but somehow the current me isnt!why! why!yea its great that i'll get to see the subang ppl like,jon tan,suleen,daphne,emily,james,justin,soon jin n the gang.sadly ken isnt here anymore...sighz...well hope i'll get hyped up 2molo!  All good things have n end.and the end is near.YES my parents are coming back tomorrow.seems so soon.they've been away for one n a half weeks.why cant they go for one month or something!!! ish.... my life is soooooo gonna change...im gonna be in trouble too! well i better pray hard 2nite!! cya guys! good nite!

OF ALL THINGS! a cigarette?jeez...sheesh yes! what a dumb@$$ lolz. mebbe it reminded him of form 1's english lit:life's brief candle...ahha...must be the dumbest philosophy ever!!  dunno if u r laughing but i can assure u its really funny,its probably harder to explain here,ask me 2 tell u personally for a good laugh =)  so i was teasing him how life can be like a lighter as WELL! LIFE IS LIKE A LIGHTER-its starts with a spark,you light up others' life n when you run out of gas you die!  anywayz went to cyber in the afternoon played the new CS,yea its fun especally the counter-terrorists' new 'shield' lolz me n my fren were running round n round to shoot each other!

      haha these few days I have realised how credit hungry my friends can be! Namely  Adam Ng Kah Yew,Kenneth Lee Sing Han, and Robyn Lau Zheng Ying .Ever since some people have been praising me for how nice this site can be (it is wert) these 3 friends who have been my 'fellow warriors' in blogging have been craving for acknowlegement. OKOK so yes u guys  DID  helped me, taught me,and got me started off...but i deserve credit too rite..=P oklah...just to make u guys happy(fuyoh!) Adam n Robyn are the people who have taught me alot of HTML and told me where to get the scripts and codes.Kenneth on the other hand(ahem!),was the main reason why i didnt move to this blog earlier..i think many would know that he got me pulling my hair out of fustration last week just because he couldn explain something simple...anywayz okok as u can see in the chatterbox he  DID  teman me to the cyber cafe last weekend so that i could add certain stuff to this blog.but ken,do remember how  RELUCTANT  you were and how many times u  FFK  me!!  Today was yet another ordinary day of school.But with a lil spice added. Well you all know how playful me and gang can be.k,let me elobarate. while i was talkin to Adam n Robyn in class Quan Han(also named Rhino) attempted to throw a chalk at me, and of course he missed,it landed on the table in front of me.So duh of course i threw it back lah! i did n it hit his forehead! BULLSEYE! LOLZ...and rhino had to shield his face in embarassment and said:'kai dau de'(lucky shot) and up came Xue Zhang(also called Dog) he wanted to try his luck.So i picked up a water bottle and baseball-style tried yo whack the chalk.YES i manage to hit it but unfortunately i whacked it straight into a girls cheek...ooooooopppppppppppppsssssss... eheehehe yeah...kept saying sorry after that.=P  Today is Thurs and I'm leading worship for YF this saturday.Haven really finished yet but i roughtly have something in mind,hopefully i can finish it later.Another thing is Esther told me yesterday that she wants me to share something on Youth Sunday(Aug 1).She said something like a 2 min sharing on God's Goodness.Yes I've shared many times in small group discussions or in YF or something but never to the entire church,up on the stage with a mike!.Pray that I find the right things to share and that what i share would be meaningful to the church.  Btw guys i just put up a guestbook on the sidebar..pls sign it yea! thanks.

      On friday night,my older bro came back from UK after graduating from the University of Warwick with 2nd class honours in Industrial Economics.He's finally back after 3 years,and guess what he bought for me?? the   NEW MANCHESTER UNITED JERSEY   yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D        my new and old Man Utd jersey =D is anyone jealous yet =P  He oso brought back his camera,and it seems it has been passed down to me...YES!!! finally,a digicam of my own(well sort of)..its a Sony DSC-P20,which is kinda old too,the features sux,only 1.3 mega pixels,no optical zoom,but hey! its good enought for me! Seems like i'll be putting more pics around here from now on ;) but my bro lost the cable,so i think i have to go buy a cable to transfer the pics to my com...ish...         my 'new' cam   the annual youth quiz was held at Subang Jaya Gospel Centre,here's how it ended:   1)Agape Chapel    2)SSGC    3)SJGC    4)PJGH    5)BSGC    well i must say that the race was pretty close this year,the marks were relatively reachable and werent too far apart,hmm,i guess thats a good thing.but i think SS and Agape cheated in some way.Some youths who represented Agape were SS youths.Agape is a satelite church of SS after all,well i might be wrong,..but, syabas diucapkan kepada Agape Chapel,the newcomers!     &nbsp;  and then on sunday,we had our final captain ball training before copa iba,im in the first snr team,as the 2nd midfielder after David.The sad thing is,i'm not sure if i can go for copa iba annot,im afraid my parents wont allow... probably gonna ask them on tuesday or wednesday lah!hopefully i can go..  ok back to the topic,training went well for the 1st snr team(we beat everone including the rojak team comprising of all guys and we played with a player short)&nbsp;and the jr team,it was quite dissapointing for the 2nd snr team,the even lost to the jr team,honestly,i think that the lack of training sessions are to be blamed,but you guys can still play better if you try your best!!    a note to some of the 2nd snr team players:i'm sorry if this post has in someway offended you,but i honestly think&nbsp;u guys should've train properly and took the sessions seriously,but not all is lost,u guys have many copa iba's ahead =)     &nbsp;  later at night,a&nbsp;few of youths got baptized.Caleb,Juen Nin, and Ee Lin.Congrats! May God bless you,and may your spiritual journey skyrocket much more from now on!.Sammie didnt get baptized in the end.at first her parents didnt really approve of it,but in the end they told her that she could if she wants,but they doubt thats she's ready.So in the end,she felt the same way and decided not to.actually,im pretty proud of her,mainly cos she had n took the guts to NOT get baptized,and seriously think abt whether she was ready annot,and i'm sure from now on,she'll make sure she will be ready the next time =)

      haha i know this sounds abit awkward but yeah its about  zips ,those used in pants,skirts n so on..  u see it all started when i was zipping up in cluz after the stupid zip fell down,and my fren saw me n asked'watcha doin?scartching ur   ah?' and i was like:'no!! the stupid thing keeps falling down!' and then he taught me the wonders of   The Zip    it was only on monday that my friend told me that the zips can be 'locked' by facing it down...as in after you have zipped up,u face it down to 'lock' it.. i really didnt noe this,for my whole life i've been wearing pants(duh wif zips) and i didnt noe it could be locked... no wonder sometimes i have problems with certain pants,i wonder why does the zip keep 'falling' down by itself..  yeah called me dumb,stupid,blur n all that..but i really didnt noe! nobody taught me  mar  ,all i can say is blame it on the parents,they nv taught me!lol...  yeah another important lesson in my life! =D

      This year i seem to be more interested in technology.i crave for the newest cutting edge technology.i want many things =P.like many others i am totally in love with the Sony Ericsson K700   wow...isnt she just lovely??!!  i suddently have this thing for taking pic.its like this sudden interest inside me.which is why i have been using my dad's ancient Casio QV2300UX.   and also why i have been putting lotsa pic around here..and that of cos means i WANT a digicam of my own !! hopefully my parents will get me one IF i go aussie..they got my bro one when he went to UK,because they wanted him to send pix of himself home,but let me just say that IN 3 WHOLE YEARS HE HAS NEVER SENT ANY! the only time my parents saw his face was when he came back every year,which brings my point of why buying him one in the first place??shud've given it to me...AHH!!  and of cos there is a NEED for a new pc in this house.My com is really terrible.its so slow that i cant play games on it,its so problematic that i have to learn to use the com ALONG with these probs. of cos there's no point buying a com now as IF i go to aussie i will get a new one to myself *yayy!*  hmm and i've been thinking about getting a webcam as well,oh well,wait for the new laptop i guess =D  seems as if many things depend on the aussie mission.  well,if your planning to buy me something soon,this post is the biggest hint you'll ever get...

      Intergrity-what we were taught at Project Samuel 2003.'Integrity-to walk the talk and not talk the talk'.to make it simple,it means 'action speaks louder than words'.   yesterday something happened that really struck me.right in through the heart.  why am i still facing this problem?why am i still sinning?i've been taught this lots of times,but why cant i FULLY apply it in my life?when is it gonna start?now?never?i'm so dissapointed in MYSELF.sometimes,i know certain things are wrong,but i continue to do them,and after sometime it becomes a routine,or as if it isnt wrong doing it.when am i ever gonna learn?  today was a pretty miserable day.mainly cos i was feeling so guilty for what i did.the whole day from waking up from bed,getting ready,bus,school,classes,home.the feeliing is the same.i feel so uncomfortable.  why am i only 'talking the talk'?.sometimes i feel i'm not good enough to serve as a committee member in YF.sometimes i feel that i'm not suitable,sometimes i feel that i dont deserve this privillege in honouring God.  maybe God wanted this to happen to me.maybe he wanted me to experience this.maybe God wanted this to be a lesson.maybe God wanted this to settle it once and for all....i really hope so.  Heavenly Father,i feel really terrible now,i confess my sins to you Lord.i feel moodless,i feel bad,i feel guilty.I pray that father this will be a final lesson to me,that i will change from now onwards,that i will start anew.Lord i pray that you will be with me as i go through this journey,give me strength,wisdom,and your blessings.I commit my entire life to you Lord,in your own precious name i pray,Amen.

      Well,the end of the weekend is here.its sunday night and now as i look back what has happened i thank God for everything...  Saturday Got up about 9.30.parents were already screaming at me.they said i shud get up at 9 and get my day started...shessh.nvm..YF was abit quiet that day,mainly because it was raining like mad n there was jams everywhere! i was stuck in this jam for about half n hour,n this is in section 14 PJ!okay,so after YF we went over to the chin's place for adrian's farewell...haha it was a hilarious night! somehow when we did our traditional write what you think of that person-what you want that person to remember on the paper thing,there were some jokers who wrote love letters(1 person even signed it with benny!!lol),and  alomost everyone told adrian to REMEMBER TO BRUSH HIS TEETH! muahaha...well,its kinda sad that adrian is leaving.the YF committee will lose someone who is truly very important.another thought that day was my concern for the YF committee.well adrian's leaving in 2 weeks,melissa's leaving next month,eugene's leaving end of the year,next year me n esther might leave as well,and gabriel is retiring.!! my goodness,thats 6 of us! and there will be only 5 'left behind'...and the presence of these people will be even more required next year when the new batch of std 6ers come up,we all noe how big a group they are,all in all 12 of them!but of course me n ether not really comfirmed yet.but i really hope that God will find others to replace us,as YF would really need extra hands next year...  Sunday OKAY! big day! youth sunday.i must say,uncle phye keat's led worhip must have been one of the best worship sessions i have EVER attended on a sunday.his song selection was fantastic,the sharings was great!n i loved every part of it,God's presence could be felt throught out the worhship session.ok,after that was my turn to step up and share and introduce the song item.well as i got up 2 the mic,pulled it up,and said a few words,suddently i could see that EVERYONE looked up and started staring at me...i was SOOO nervous,the lower part of my legs were shivering a lil,but i was fine lah,..haha thankfully.as most of u would noe i shared on my social life,shared abt the '99 team' and shared abt my stage of 'friendlessness'.after everything,during coffee hour alot of people came up 2 me to thank me for the sharing.some people even said that they were touched and it gave them a new understanding of us youth!haha i shaked so  many people's hands today,people i dont even know!but truly God works in unbeliveable ways, i never thought my simple and youthy sharing could be so powerful...only God can do these things!to God be the glory!but the sad thing is my 2 frenz couldnt make it,especially the GUY,i really wanted him 2 be there....sigh.during sunday school ,there was the interview for the baptism candidates,those who decided to get, baptized are:Koh Ee Lin,Samantha Tan,Caleb Lor Yung Ming,and Woon Juen Nin.Glad to know you guys have chosen to take this step of obedience!Proud of you guys!=)  Well i gtg now,sayonara!
