       The Child    Darkest shadows come and sun is gone We together bond in liqueurs love Forbidden fruits we tast we like Incircle ourselves in vicious play The mourning come takes love away  Words of wisdom old phrases told Within the kingdom life behold The child one with potion seeks The death in life freely weeps To yesterday we drink a toast In futures past the wrongs we wrote In keeping time the futures come To write the wrong and save the child Although the love fades to grey For you and child the love will stay  For two who played with poision gay Cupids arrow hath missed it's prey Good comes from bad you came on this day Our good child we'll say      Alicia Dawn Tully                                she wrote this and for some reason, I like it. talking to her about her writing really opens up her self to   me, I learned alot about her from our convesations.

I wish there was someway to get deported back to wheve ever in the hell she was from. oh well. Besides that, the day was excellent and Her was near me most of the day, that was the best thing about the day. Her perfume is still on my clothes.......very nice

       Well, this evening I was playing my guitar. The piece that I was practicing was called "Midsummer's Daydream" by rik Emmet. It is a beautiful piece and has many subtle dynamics and nuances that are very hard to capture. I started learning this piece when I was 16 and found ot to be very tricky and hard, I practiced and practiced for years, trying to get some of the faster runs down and after 17 years of perseverance, i finally got it down, i could play this piece at Rik's speed without error and had the dynamics down. It sounds amazing when all the notes come together and the runs blend in perfectly. On one note you have to hit a high D on the e string that has to ring clear or else the piece sounds limp, it was here after making a clean intro and was making my way to this point when I plucked the string  and SNAP!!!. the damn string broke and nearly gouged out my eye. It was last year that i made a recording and gave it to a special person, the recording was heavily edited and pieced together through the magic of modern recording technology, I wanted to make a new recording for this person that was not pieced but a complete run......maybe in the next few days I'll get to it. After all she is worth it.

       Well, I have been working for this company for the past three years and have seen many things that make you question, "what the hell are they thinking?. The mangement has been the real reason this company hasn't exploded into sucesss, first "Helen" has never ran a company before and I heard that she used to work at walmart. Her constant disorganized approach to getting her jobs out have impaired the workers ability to use innovative and creative thinking to solve the many probelms that this company is facing. "Babette" is one of the owners and does all the purchasing, she has no people skills and is my boss, her lack of management skills really hampers my trust in her.     The real work gets done in the back and have witnessed many a miracle with the workers. I have tried to be a good leader even though it is not my job but still I have to try and make these people believe that not all "office folk" are idiots such as the sales people.     The only reason i stayed so long is because of one person, her name shall remain a secret for a while. She is smart and has an "untapped potential" that could turn into something special for me and this company.
