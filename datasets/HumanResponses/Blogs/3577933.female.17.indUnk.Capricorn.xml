      Woke up kinda early this mornin'...around 6:00ish...and then couldn't fall back asleep. It's all good. I just got off the phone with my friend Nicolle. I met her in Europe...she goes to Woodstock..or she used to. Grad. this yr. But yeah..her and Jessica..(another W.stock grad.) might come down this Friday. And we are goin to have like a "Europe reunion". It's gonna be awesome! I miss those guys...but we'll have our fun this summer! Sux to be the "young one" outta the bunch!  Today, I have no idea what I am doin'....once again. Might start runnin'/exercisin or w/e. Get back in shape ya know! :). I might be goin to this Drumline camp next week in Dublin for a few days. But I'm not sure yet because I want to go to Atlanta and see a few of my friends for the week instead. At least the ones I know from UGA/Norcross/and Woodstock. Not sure yet. But I have to get goin for now...I have friends comin' over for some HALO!  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Amanda ~ *

      This time change is STILL killin me! I went to bed last night around 10:30ish..and ppl. were callin me and I was so out of it! I woke up this mornin' around 7ish and fell asleep then again at 8:30 then just couldn't sleep so I got up. I've NEVER woken up this early while at home durin the summer! lol. It's all good though. I have no idea what I will be doin today. It's about 12:30 right now. I'll probably see when I will be headin up to the ole' ATL. to see a few ppl. that I miss! It seems like I'm never home these days...like I'm already in college..lol. j/k.  Well, I'm goin to go call Jennifer and see if she wants to do somethin' today. If not, then I will probably sit around my house and do nothin'...probably practicin' all day if I'm not goin anywhere.   Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Amanda ~ *

      I'm back...finally! The trip was sooo much fun...yet sooo long. We left GA. pretty early...it was about a 4 hr. flight to New Jersey. Then from there about a 9 hr. flight to London. International flights are frickin awesome! You get your own TV with movies, music vids, video games, and TV shows. EVEN DISNEY! WOO! :).   LONDON:  We got to London about 5:00 p.m. Hit the hotel and went to this orientation meeting or w/e...then we all passed out about 12:00 a.m. Woke up the next day...went to old historic sites...and checked out one of the queens castles..it was awesome! The next day in London, we had a concert, then we had to find our group leader to go walking. Well....some of us had to change b/c it was sooo hot. Our uniforms for the concerts were blue polo shirt,white pants, blue socks, and brown boots. So Reka, Stewart and I changed on the bus. We got off the bus and everyone was gone. So Stewart said he knew around the place..lol..and of course you know we're walkin just us 3 around London...no idea where we were. We knew that our group leader wanted to go to the Hard Rock Cafe. So we just asked someone how to get there. We took the underground train ... it was pretty cool. Well we got there and no one was there...we waited for 2 hrs..and no one showed up. So ... now what....WE'RE LOST! We walk around London tryin to figure out where our hotel is and everything. After about an hour of just "walking around", I just said lets to to this local hotel right around the corner and ask them if they know where it is. There was 56 of the same name of the hotel that we were stayin in!! You know..it's one thing to get lost in Savannah or somethin...but when you are in a country where ppl. don't understand you and you have no idea where you're at or the name of things...it's pretty scary!!! lol. We ended up finding it and we took a taxi there. We were like 30 min away from our hotel in a Taxi! It was bad! Then we got to the hotel and just stayed there! I just think that we were too scared to go out anywhere w/o a group after that! .... London....was nice...b/c we did see all the sites while exploring the country.....while we were LOST!   PARIS:  Paris was cool. Not too good of food...lol...but it was cool. Went to the Eiffel Tower and our visit to Notre-Dame. Man...there's these ppl. at the Eiffel Tower before you go onto it..they try to sell you stuff. They were like grabbing our arms and sayin " you want to buy...buy good stuff?". I had to walk around with ppl like all around me that way they couldn't get to me! It was crazy! Weather was awesome there though..cool enough to wear shorts and have a light jacket.   SWITZERLAND:  Switzerland was THE BOMB!!! I would have to say this was my favorite place! I would love to live there for a few yrs...well actually I will live there when I get older...for at least a year man! It was soo pretty there. The scenery of the mountains almost looked fake b/c it was sooo beautiful! (Guys you could score some major brownie points by takin ur woman here!). It was a small lil' town of Champery. All these lil' stores and the cobble stone roads. Then you walk out of your hotel balcaney and its nothing but mountains and snow..and...ahh it was sooo amazing. I remember the last morning we stayed there we got up at 6:00 a.m in the mornin'. We took a ride up to the mountains and checked out the scenery up there...it was awesome. A bit cloudy..but awesome. One of my friends Brandon was on this mini' mountain and we were all comin down..and he tripped and just ROOLLLED all the way down. I felt soo bad..but it was the funniest thing I saw that whole trip. I did make a new language up..b/c there in Switzerland they speak German and French. SO I just called it Switz!lol. That was one place that I'll never forget! And not to forget that I learned how to "Polka Dance" there on our last night! :)  LIECHTENSTEIN/AUSTRIA:  We went to a buncha' villages here. It was a cute lil place...really small though. :). I'd be good livin there..dontcha' think? hehe.  VENICE:  4:45 a.m WE DEPART FOR VENICE FOR THE DAY!!! OMG! It was suuuch a long day. Got up, ate breakfast, slept on the bus for 4 hrs on the way there. I would have to say that Italy had the BEST FOOD EVER! Especially their pizza at "Piazza San Marco, and ice cream! WOW...I must have had like 7 cones of ice cream .... that day! lol. Went into St. Marks too..such a beautiful place!  GERMANY:  This was the next best place. Cute lil town and stores and everything. We walked around the whole wall of Rothenburn ob der Tauber! :). All the stores were awesome..they sold like all these lil bears..and some sang. So we would go in there and dance...and dance some more! Oh yeah..we did go to the birkenstocks store and we got some shoes..the ORIGNALS! They are soo awesome! We had our last "get together" with everyone that was on the trip. Took some pix with everyone. So sad!   ~~ Overall the trip was an awesome experience! Especially having NO washer and dryer and having to hand wash everything. The suitcases were sooo packed that you had to get ppl. to sit on them to zip it up! While you're there you starve because you're not used to eatin "little" food. Everything had CORN in it! Even the salads! lol. But hey you stay in shape! All that walkin! I guess we don't realize how lucky we have it here in the US...but we do! I'm glad to be home..I miss everyone...and miss seeing everything...but glad to be home.   Well, I'm gonna be off to bed now. It's about 6:30 p.m. here and I'll probably sleep until tom. mornin'! :). We woke up at 3:00 am to leave from Germany, and didn't get back until 3 this morning. We had a 5 hr layover in Atl. to Savannah. It was crazy! But that was my 16 days for the summer! I hope everyone is havin the same amount of fun that I did!..Now I gotta' enjoy my tour to my bed...woo! :)  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Amanda ~ *

      Well, today is my last day in my house for a while...last night as well. (Gezz I make it sound like I'm movin out or somethin' and never comin' back!). But it's just the fact that I've never been away from home more than 5 days...much less outta' the country! hehe. I'm still not finished with my packin stuff yet and I have till' tonight. I just hate packin' ... it's so agrivatin! That's one thing I know mama WONT do for me! lol. But yeah, still have a ways to go till I'm finished with that!   Today, well sux...b/c it's rainin'. And for my last day here for a while...I really wish I could go outside and do somethin'! BUT NO..RAININ ALL FRICKIN' DAY! I'm gonna miss my buddies here. Some of them are gone...but I'm used to doin the same thing every summer with them. They are all goin' out tonight, but I can't b/c I'm probably goin' to spend it with my family. I'll miss them yes...but I can't wait to get away for a bit. Vacation..you know how it is. :).   Last night my sister and her friend were here, and they wanted to "camp out" outside. So you know, she pulled that "well Amanda I'm not goin to be able to see you for a while." So I went outside with them. Well, it hit around....I wanna' say 1:45a.m. And she's like "Amanda, I wanna go inside, it's hot!" As soon as she said that it started to rain! AHH! So we're all haulin' butt back inside..lol. So much for spendin' quality time together! gezz!   I just got this letter from one of my good friends Anthony. He sent me this packet for this Dublin Drumline camp this summer. I went to it last yr. and had a BLAST! Learned little stuff in drumline that I really never knew.(See you do learn new stuff every day! :) ) But, it's right after I get back from Europe and it's for 4 days. I really wanna' go but I dunno w/ the money deal that we are usin' for Europe that I'd be able to. I'm gonna try though, b/c this would be my last yr.(since I'm an upcomin senior and all...WOO!) Yeah, it would be cool if they let me go, just to even keep my hands goin' and meet new ppl. I loooove socializin and drummin'. I think if I drummed as much as I talked...I'd be with BD already.  BD = Blue Devils...they are a Drum Core(like a professional marching band) in Concord,CA. I want to make their drumline one day. THAT WOULD BE THE BOMB!   Atlanta Quest drumline, is a drumline in Atlanta,GA that I play with for WGI (pretty much indoor drumlines that compete..and colorguards too!). We practice every weekend...Friday and Sat....from Nov-April. Then have world finals in either CA. or OH. It's awesome to become a part of. I've learned so much there and met a lot of ppl. too that are b/t ages of 14-22. It's crazy! BUT WORTH THE HARD WORK! I miss those guys...that's the hard part...is sayin goodbye..b/c I live about 4 - 5 hrs away from where we rehearse at every weekend! And yes I have my mom to thank for that drivin me up there EVERY WEEKEND! WOW! Yes a long ways! Luv er' 4 it! But hey..she only has a yr. left with me!  Well, off to pack again...FUN STUFF!...not. I'll be writin and chattin' and...yeah...L8r!  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Manda ~ *

       Well, something else I have to do online. This BLOG SPOT thing is pretty cool. I just woke up not too long ago, and it's about 2ish. WOW IM LAZY! LoL! But what can you expect? I'm still in HS, and it's my SUMMER OFF! WOO! I just can't believe that I'm going to be a senior next yr. Time goes by so fast and you don't realize it until you're almost finished. I tell you what, listen to others when they say "enjoy it while it lasts", because it's true...very true. Even though you can't wait to get to college(like me)...there's SOME things about HS you will miss. And it's hittin me already and I haven't even graduated! Gezz, I'm pathetic!   Anyways, I'm goin' to be goin' to Europe here this Thursday. I'm goin' to be in the Georgia Ambassadors of Music. It's pretty much a group of students that get selected in the state of GA. (about 60 students), that practice music for 2 days, then head off to Europe and perform it. We're goin' to England,France,Switzerland,Liechtenstein,Austria,Italy, and Germany. Pretty awesome if ya' ask me! I leave about 6:00am Thursday mornin' and head up to Atlanta.(about a 4 hr drive). We practice at Norcross High School for a few days then we're takin off in the plane Saturday mornin'! WOO! Wish me luck! There's just one problem....they only allow us to take ONE SUITCASE FOR THE WHOLE TRIP! WOW!!! Yes, it has to be like 58 lin. in.! Ahh...I must have spent more time lookin' for a suitcase than I did packin!....well I'm not quite finished with that either..but you know. :). I just can't wait to go! It'll look really good on my resume for college I'm pretty sure!   Speakin' on colleges, I'm really not sure which one I want to go to yet. I know I have a year, but I haven't even taken SAT's...and..yeah I need to get on that thinkin' about it. :). I want to try to get into UGA, if not that then MTSU. And if not that, then Kennesaw. I dunno. I have a few colleges picked out. Just not sure which colleges are willin to pick ME out.:). I miss are graudates this yr. It's crazy..most of my friends were in that class and the class before. I mean I have soph. friends from this yr...but man...it's so weird being the older one now that everyone looks up to. I guess you understand that when you hit your senior yr. But thinkin' about it, I remember walking around the school on the last week, when the senior weren't there. It was weird. My whole lunch table was seniors...and now...it's not. It's upcomin' Juniors. Which is cool, but it's just weird not seein the same ppl. I have been seein since I was a Fresh. Oh well, Ill be that graduatin' person one day! WOO!....yes I'm gonna miss the younger ones at our school then...lol. Gezz!   Well, I'm off for now! Have a Gr8 day!!

       Man, I must find some extra space or somethin' because I just packed for a good week and a half..and still have more to go. See, the thing is when I get over there, it would take me 3 hrs. just to wash clothes over there. The line is SOO long and I wouldn't get to take any pix over at Europe. Instead I'd be waisting me time just washin stuff. And truthfully, I think I'm just gonna bring a lotta f.breeze! Watcha' think about that? lol. Overall, I'm just ready to go and enjoy it. Finally a vacation away from the house, no parents, and nothing to worry about here for a while. It's gonna be great....but I know when I come home....I'll be gald to be back. Havin' my own bed back and everything..ya know? :). Of course you do, because while I'm in Europe havin' all the fun you are goin' to be here, in the US, in the same place as always. lol..I'm just kiddin'. I hope that everyone else has a good summer and enjoy's it as much as I will. This is my LAST HIGH SCHOOL SUMMER! WOO! Once again, it's scary to be old, but it feels great. I guess I kinda am a youngin' lol...especially whoever is in college that I hang out with or talk to. But Europe will be fun.  .......once I finish this packin' buisness!   ~ Feel free to call me if ya need me or just wanna talk and keep me from goin' insane with this packin' stuff! I should be home!   Luv -n- God Bless,  * ~ Manda ~ *

      Well today I woke up around 11 or so.  Yesterday was my last day of band camp.....for High School. hehe. We had our preview show last night. It was pretty good..not THAT bad..but the tempo got off kinda b/t the band and drumline....as usual. But that's not that hard to fix. We just have to get used to being in front of the band instead of marchin and playin behind them. It's weird. A lot of alumni showed up at the show last night. Guess they wanted to see what they had comin' up after they left. They thought we were pretty good...at least that's what I got from them. I saw my old drumline capt. Jared. I miss em'. Proably goin to see if I can stay w/ him for the UGA vs. Gsu game on Sept. 4th. Him and Cody are dormin together. I can't wait for our 1st football game! I was duttin' so loud last night at the show. THen ppl. came up to me and said that I reminded them of that snare chick from Bluecoats. (Erin..shes a cool chick!) But anyways. I'm gettin' ready to go to Florida today. Goin' to visit my grandparents for a few days before my summer is over.  I haven't seen them since last x-mas. MISS EM MAN!  Well, I have to get goin now. Packin' time!

       Well today went really well! We finished the opener of our show.32&nbsp;SETS!!!&nbsp;ITS SOOO AWESOME! Our drumline is actually runnin' to our spots when they tell us to go back a few sets in the drill. And we're actually playin' well as a line too. It's just overall good...but overall tiring. We've been outside from early in the mornin' until about 9 at night. Feet hurt more than my back. Actually my back doesn't really hurt at all. And it's awesome! Tom. we have a half day so it isn't that bad. And then Thursday is another full day, then we have movie night. Then Fri. we finish up stuff, then have our preview show @ 7:30 for our parents and friends and stuff. So it should be interesting to see what else we get down before then. We also got this new instructor just for the week. Her name is Amanda. She's from UGA. SHE"S AWESOME TOO! Even though we do kinda' miss our old instructor. But Amanda is a cool chick. :). Sux that she can't go to our 1st football game. She teaches a line up at Stockbridge. But we are givin her one of our drumline shirts just for helpin us this week. ;).    &nbsp;  I actually can't wait until school starts and we start performin' our show! Also miss all of my friends from school and stuff. Can't wait to see em'! Quest auditions are comin' up here pretty soon. As well as college auditions...eh. Hopefully I'll get into MTSU. I really wanna go there. Just have to take the SAT's. Well, I'm gonna head off to bed. Gotta get up early!    &nbsp;  Luv -n- God Bless,   * ~ Manda ~ *

       Well, what can you say. Drama is never stopping. Well, I guess I'll go ahead and explain. Cody and I drove up to Atl. Saturday mornin'/afternoon...b/c he was a lil late..lol. But it's all good. I stayed with Nicolle that night and Cody stayed with his woman Jessica. Well, it was Nicolle, me, Jacob, and David that ended up at her house. Nicolle had went upstairs to go to sleep....and Jacob and I ended up makin out. Ya...we did. Ok...that happened that night...let me tell you about the time before    &nbsp;  ------goin back into time---------------    &nbsp;  Nicolle and I ended up bein pretty good friends in Europe. I love that girl to death..we get along so well. Well anyways. She was havin a hard time with her ex that dated for a few yrs. and then her and Jacob were talkin and stuff throughout Europe. She came back to Atl. and I went to visit them the week after. She told me some stuff about them two...that I'm keepin to myself....but that no one knew except me. Thought it was pretty cool though....but then again sucked that no one knew. It was makin it hard on Jacob and her at the same time because she didn't know what to do or what to say. So I talked to her about it. She had decided to just move on and not worry about it. THATS the impression that I got from her...and THATS the impression that he got from her too. So they were nothing anymore at the time. Well I came back a few weeks later....known as the top paragraph that I started this with..and stayed with her. That crap happened at her house. She was goin on vacation like a few days after I got there. SO I wasn't goin to tell her yet. I wanted to tell her when she got back so she would enjoy her vacation. Thinkin that she would get back Sunday....and not Friday. She got home early. She found out from other people than me..and I was goin to tell her...I really was. I had no idea that they were still "liking" each other from what she told me that they had ended it. ANd I felt like crap when I found out.     &nbsp;  You know, people make mistakes, it's just the mistakes that need to be forgiven. I feel so bad about that....I really did have a great friend. And I was NOT goin to keep that from her. I wish I was the 1st person to tell her...and I wish that she would talk to me about it.....    &nbsp;  * ~ Amanda ~ *

       Ahh..well today was the 1st day of camp for the band. We got a lot of the drill down. Our 1st song in our show is about 32 sets of drill. Yeah...that's just the 1st song...CRAZY! But we'll do it. We had a long day today. It's soo hot outside. We had 5 people pass out, and 2 get sick all day. They are droppin' out like flies! It's not even the whole day outside for them yet. Drumline it will be whole days though. Of course drumline, we always get stuck outside..hehe. It's all good. I was the only one outside w/ my snare today b/c I have to keep time for the band to set drill and during marchin' basics.&nbsp; I'm sooo tired. I shouldn't be this tired yet. We haven't really gotten into band&nbsp; camp yet. haha. O well. I'll survive. I miss my Atl. friends though. Think about them a lot durin the day..wonderin' if their camp is goin well. We're tryin' to still look for a drum tech. for our line. The girl that is helping us is only coming down for next week..and that's it. THAT SUX! It's so weird during the end of the day walkin' in the band room looking at everyone and seeing all these new freshman and stuff. I miss all the seniors from last yr. And now I'm finally one...woo! :). I'm so ready to get out of here! lol. Well, I'm goin to go take a shower..I stink ... really bad...haha. PeAcE oUt!    &nbsp;  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Manda ~ *

       Well, today was an early day. I had to be up around 6:00ish in the morn'. Ya' for drumline today. Things are kinda' hard right now without a drum tech. Chris should've stayed..but...he had a good opportunity ahead of him so he took it. It's understandable. But...man does it suck! We worked on the opener today. The battery is playin' with front at the beg. of the show. And the band is just marchin' so it's just drumline playin! It's sooo cool! I had to teach/take over today durin' sectionals. Teachin' is harder when you know the people you are teachin' and they are the same age as you while you're tryin to tell them to do somethin'. I mean most of them did listen..and that's awesome. We showed each other respect. But sometimes there's always those 1 or 2 people that scare ya about the line. Oh well, hopefully that we'll be cool. I'm not sure though anymore about this whole HS drumline thing. I mean I never quit anything......but honestly....I'm not sure if I'll be marchin with South anymore. Like I'm really considering quitting. I'm havin' such hard times here @ home. I just can't stand it anymore. My parents go at it like crazy...and every night I just sit here wonderin' what it would be like...to have a normal family. Seriously. I dunno...so much to think about...    &nbsp;  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Manda ~ *

       Today, has been, once again, a boring day in  Effingham . Of course though, because no one around here is home, or everyone that I have been hanging out with all summer is in Florida or Atlanta. I was in  Atlanta  for the past few days of this week. Went up Saturday night with my friend Cody, who is datin' my friend Jessica up there. Long drive. Stayed at Nicolles that night. It was me, Nicolle, David, and Jacob. I love the guys up there...everyone is so awesome. BUT A LOT OF DRAMA! We watched this movie called " Cabin Fever ". That had to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen! And it was pretty sick too. But it's all good! We woke up the next mornin' and went to a DCI show at  JSU . Great showin'... Blue Devs  of course won..:). MY BOYS! WOO! But I give it to  SCV  man..they're drumline is kickin butt! I ended up seein' a lot of ppl. from Europe there..it was like a reunion or somethin'! Then I hung out with Vega and all walkin around after they performed their show. Went home to Nicolles then got up and went to Woodstock HS and watched their drumline for the day. They're pretty good..have some things to work on..but they'll do fine. They have good instructors and all so..it's all good. Then Jessica, Cody, Chris, Jacob, and I went to the movies and saw I,Robot. It was ok...not as "great" as i expected but it was an okay movie. I was so sad to leave though...had some good times this week. I miss everyone. I won't be seein Nicolle for like..a half a yr. She's gone to JSU...and I'm still STUCK IN HIGH SCHOOL! It's all good though. Hopefully I can pull my grades up and get into a good college. I think everything w/ one of my friends there in Atl. has things worked out. At least I hope. He's a good kid I feel so bad for him though. But at least he had a smile on his face the majority of the time. So it's all good. He's became a good friend of mine lately..miss hangin' w/ him once in a while..but I"m not goin to see him for about a month again. Ahh..sux here. 4 hrs away. But I'll live. Last yr man...then I'll be finished!    &nbsp;   Luv  -n-  God  Bless, * ~  Manda  ~ *

       Well this is cool. I didn't know I could change the color and whatnot..lol..man I'm so dumb sometimes! Anyways, I'm still tryin' to figure out if I can go to Nicolle's house or not. Mom is so "unsure" about things these days. I can't wait to get out on my own in college just to get away from Effingham. I know guys who are in college, you say its okay because you will miss your parents..but I'm not at that stage yet. To me, getting out of the house to go to the store with a friend now is great. So yeah...lol. I wanted to go to Atlanta tomorrow afternoon and stay until Monday or Tuesday with ppl. from Woodstock and Norcross. Talkin' about a game on Saturday for the Braves and the JSU show Sunday. Then Monday and Tuesday just hang out. But I doubt my mom would let me. It's rare that she trusts me or doesn't let me b/c "dad has controll over her". Figures. But w/e dude...I just can't wait to get out of here. I had to much fun in Europe just knowin' that my parents weren't there raggin my butt over stupid stuff...or thinkin' that I do stuff behind their back...when I DON"T! Like I never drank in Europe..I never did anything stupid like that. It just sux knowin' that ur parents don't trust you over anything or w/ anyone. I'm goin' to be 18 in like&nbsp;5 months thank God. It's gonna be awesome that way I can visit my friends in Atl. a little bit more often...I hope.     &nbsp;  Today, like mom keeps wakin me up before frickin 12:00 pm in the afternoon. Yes, I know that's late...but I like to enjoy my sleepin' durin the summer while I have it man. Instead she wakes me up, and then has me goin' to her work doin' stuff for her. I guess that pays off for the last time that I went to Atl....but man still. Oh well, once again I'll be out of here in a year. And it will all be over. I'm goin to college for a good 8-10 years. Majorin' in music..I can't wait for that either! And I'm gonna' get a job and have a great life! I know I will. That's my goal in life. Have a great job, great family, and be just happy. Good goal huh? :). That is .... after I march my years of WGI/DCI. :) Hopefully I'll be gone on tour next summer...oh baby I can't wait! :). I'm gonna work my butt off though..especially when I get back to school this year...so I can pull my GPA up. Then apply to UGA,MTSU,Kennesaw, and UNT. :). YES! I can't wait...ahhh...Crazy. I'm so excited.     &nbsp;  As for now, I just hope that I'm able to go to Atl. this weekend and have fun. I hope I can I hope I can. I just need to get away. I'm ready to leave this place....    &nbsp;  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Amanda ~ *

      OH YES! I just finished talkin' to mom about goin' up to Atlanta today. She's "undecided"...but I think I might have her on this one! I'm goin' 2 talk 2 my friend Nicolle...whom I'm probably gonna' stay with...and see if I can go back up there and hang out with her for a while! I CAN'T WAIT! There's a JSU show goin' on Sunday that I might go up there and see. Mr. Sikes (my old assistant band director..he's the bomb!)...called askin if I was headin up there. So I might go up to the show on Sunday and see what's up with that. But yeah, that'd be awesome if I went back up Friday night or Saturday! Hopefully mom trusts me enough to go up there. These are the last few days of my summer until band camp starts! :). (which I can't wait for that either...drumline is gonna be AWESOME!..I hope!) But yeah mom might let me go up to Atlanta once again! YEAH BABY! :). I have to call Cody and see if he's goin up there...it'd be a lot easier gettin' a ride from him. :). I just don't wanna' see a few ppl. up there in Atl. It's my time to hang out with Nicolle and a few ppl. from Quest. SO yeah. No more drama !!! lol. Anyways, I have to get goin' now...time to leave again!  Luv -n- God BLess, * ~ Manda ~ *

      Today, I woke up around 12ish again...yes I"m gettin' earlier. I just got a phone call from one of our drum majors tellin me that there is a party Saturday for leadership. Grillin' out! WOO! I'm probably about to head up to the school in a lil' while and get a list of phone numbers and some music. Can't wait to start up the drumline again. Sucks that our drum tech. left to go to FL. I have no idea who is goin' to be there now. Well, I have to get goin' now. I'm already at the school and the summer isn't over...heh..man..I'm a dork..haha.

      Well, it's about 2:00 p.m. right now. And I'm workin' on this scrapbook with my mom. It's for my senior yr. She's workin' on the "Europe" part of it. It's really cool actually. And again, it makes me miss the guys that were on that trip with me! AHH! I just got off the phone with one of my friends Cory. He's a tenor player at the "other" (our rival) school. He used to be at our school, but his parents had to move b/c of their job. At least it wasn't out of state huh? He grad. this yr...and will be goin' to GSU. So I still get to see em'. We were talkin' about the Orlando show this Friday and Sat. for DCI. I REALLY wanna' go! That'd be sooo awesome! Everyone drum core is gonna' be there just about. Then they head off to Denver to compete in World Finals. Man I hope that if I ask mom will let me go. This is my last chance to see the guys! I'll probably talk to Cory about that today and see what he says. We have to get some more people to go though before we go askin' about it.  Man, there's so much stuff goin' on that I've been thinkin' about. With a few people that I've been majorly prayin' for because of all this drama! It's crazy! And somehow...I'm always in the middle of it. No matter WHERE I am too!! It's all good though. That's High School for ya! lol. It's just this guy, that there's so much goin' on with him right now. And I'm prayin for him and stuff. Hoping everything goes all right..and that he makes his right choices. SO much drama...in all places. It's all good though. I'm gonna go practice!!

      Well, I woke up today around 12:00ish. I had one of my best friends Amanda stay the night. I haven't seen her ALL SUMMER! We've just been gone to different places. When she's home I'm gone, and when I'm home she's gone. Crazy! We stayed up until about 6 on and off..just couldn't go to sleep!  Anyways, I went to Atlanta this past week. From Tuesday until Friday mornin'. I had SOOOO much fun! A little drama here and there...but it was AWESOME to get away from the house for a while. I just feel so bad for somethin' that's goin on up there...and I want to help so bad...but I can't b/c it's up to this person to make up their mind. They know who I'm talkin about.But... It's always good to take a break from the family living! But I got to see all my Woodstock buds. I stayed with my new awesome friend Nicolle. She's about as crazy as I am! I love that girl to death though. I wish I was back up there...b/c I'm SOOO BORED HERE! Oh yeah, I finally got to go to the Varsity! IT WAS AWESOME! They have like school lookin' tables, and GREAT CH. CHEESE HOTDOGS! Then I hung out with my friend from Norcross, Chris. He's a really sweet guy. I can talk to him about anything..and trust him to keep it to himself. We ended up talkin' until about 2:00 in the mornin' just about stupid stuff or crazy stuff. Well, then came Friday mornin'. Had to go home...BLAH! It sucked. Time went by so fast man. AH! I miss those guys up there. I need to move up there for like a month or two...lol. But at least I'm a senior this yr. and I'll be grad. soon. I'll be able to go and see them whenever I wanna'! :).  Today, I have no idea what I'm goin' to be doin'. Probably practicin' since like...band camp is in a week. FUN STUFF MAN! I actually can't wait for this yr. to start with band camp. It's gonna be awesome! I love the guys on my drumline. We get along pretty well. There are some rehearsals...where everyone is like down each others throat...but you know..we get past that. I want to win best drumline again...that was the coolest feeling!   Well, I'm gonna' go practicin' and probably runnin' too. :). Hope everyone has a wonderful day!

      I just woke up not too long ago...and it's like 12:30ish.lol. Yes I am a lazy one. New week...and last week until band camp starts up again. I don't know what I'll be doing this week since I can't go to ATL. Which sux really bad b/c it's not like I'm or was goin' to do anything stupid up there. I can't wait to get into college. I think I can actually trust myself to NOT do somethin dumb....and get yelled at for every little thing. So whatever.  Anyways, I'm goin' to try to see if I can get out of the house today. I need a break from everything..ya know how it is. :). I miss everyone from Europe man. It was probably the best 16 days of my life wakin up and seein all of my friends and away from home. I loved it. Knowin that I could be around my friends..and my case wasn't jumped on every 5 min. for somethin. It's okay though..one more yr. left. :). I'm not really sure what college I want to go to yet. Still a big decision. The 3 "far" colleges I would like or try to send aplications to would be UNT(Texas),USC(CA), or MTSU(TN). But I am not sure. I'm goin to be majorin in music. HARD MAJOR! But I know that it'll be worth it in the end. :). Well, I have to get goin' for now. Hopefully, since I'm home that I'll find somethin' to do. Besides work around the house. This is my last HS summer ya know...:)  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Amanda ~ *

      Man, I can't sleep! It's the 4th of July right now...around 2:30 in the mornin' though...but it's all good! I've had a good past few days. I hung out with one of my good friends Reka. We saw Spiderman 2 and Dodgeball. THEY WERE AWESOME MOVIES! I think I've adjusted to "Georgia time" now. Cept' I have been gettin' to bed around 1 or 2 in the mornin'!  This is my last week until band camp. This comin week I'm probably gonna be off on vacation for a lil' while..then the following week I have band camp. That should be interesting. BAND CAMP...woo it's a gonna' be a hotta one this yr! But it's all good. I got drumline capt. I'm glad that my drumline and my teachers respect me enough to have that responsibility. It's gonna be a good senior yr. I can't wait to graduate though. Wow..I'm startin to ramble. I'm gonna go ahead and go to bed now...g'night!  Luv -n- God Bless, * ~ Amanda ~ *

       Well today was the 3rd day of school...I'm so tired. Hahaha...I'm ready to graduate. I just got my classes fixed and everything. I have 2 bands now. I will be in Wind Ensemble for Percussion, and Symphonic band for somethin' else that I haven't decide yet. So my classes aren't that bad. I have Lit, SAT/prep, band, then band. Yeah..lol. Next semester is what's goin to be weird. I'm goin to have PSO, Alg. 3, then 2 bands. PSO is a college class that the professor comes to the HS and teaches for a college/HS credit. Counts for both if u pass the class. So it should be cool.       Well, I have to go for now!      Luv -n- God Bless,   * ~ Amanda ~ *

       Today, was the 1st day of my senior yr. It was pretty cool I guess. I have a butt load of HW man. I've been doin' HW for like 3 hrs. now man. GEZZ! But it's all good. Yeah, I've been gettin' these text messages about Jacob goin' on all these dates and crap. W/e man. It's pissin me off. But ya know that's life.       I found out today that we have a football game against Groves this Friday. ON THE 1st WEEK! It's gonna' be fun. I think this 1st week is just goin to be a scrimmage though..and won't count for the season. So it'll be all good.      Well, I gotta get goin and finish up on my HW.

       It's now 2:46 p.m. and in about a half of day I'll be gettin' up to go to school. Fun stuff..my senior yr! :). Gosh..but this day..found out scores for DCI. Cavies won. Congrats to them..but I love my BD! lol. Drums were SCV, BD, Cavies, then Cadets. WOW! So weird...Cadets just...fell. But it's all good. It was a good year. I can't wait till' WGI season starts back up again! Hopefully I'll be able to march Quest again. I loved it. Even just watchin' other lines and stuff..it was great.      Man, have you ever just felt like no one cared in this world....but then again a lot of people did? Yeah, it's a lil' weird..but like that's how I feel. I don't know. It's like I don't know what to do about anything anymore. Yet, I want to do what feels right, but at the same time I'll still be hurting people. This kid I'm dating Jacob, he's a really sweet and cute kid man. And actually starting to like him and stuff. We both made the same mistake and hurt people, but yet we want to keep the relationship b/c we just feel that we, for once, don't need 2 listen to anyone else at the time. I mean if we make a mistake by that in about a yr. then we do. But, I want to try it. And so does he.  You know people make mistakes, and people forgive them. But people also need just to stay out of people lives and let it be. Seriously. I don't know. Weird things man.      ......but you know...everything happens for a reason....it's just the reasoning part u don't find out until later....      Luv -n- God Bless,   * ~ Manda ~ *
