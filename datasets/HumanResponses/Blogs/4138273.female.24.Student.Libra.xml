       urlLink Esquire Magazine  has chosen Outkast's rapper, Andre 3000 as best-dressed man in 2004. According to  urlLink MTV News : " Who knew wearing dresses, fedoras and loads of pink and lime-green on the red carpet could win you the title of world's best-dressed man." Whatever happened to tuxedos and bow-ties? Or Regis' monochromatic shirt-and-tie look? We have really come a long way people... "They're kind of like a uniform, which I've always been into," Andre says in the September issue of Esquire. "To me, that's real style, anything that feels comfortable and expresses your personality and makes you stand a little taller."   You be the judge. Here's Andre in 2002 Grammy Awards, 2004 Grammy Awards and MTV Music Awards respectively.

      Just got this book today. I've been wanting to read it since last year because I've heard a lot of very good reviews.

      We went to  urlLink The Grove  tonight for a little stroll. Mom, dad and Dave wanted to check something out at  urlLink Crate & Barrel . On our way home we saw Matthew Perry a.k.a. Chandler Bing, from the widely known  urlLink FRIENDS  sitcom. One down, five to go.

              I am the  sonnet , never quickly thrilled; Not prone to overstated gushing praise Nor yet to seething rants and anger, filled With overstretched opinions to rephrase; But on the other hand, not fond of fools, And thus, not fond of people, on the whole; And holding to the sound and useful rules, Not those that seek unjustified control. I'm balanced, measured, sensible (at least, I think I am, and usually I'm right); And when more ostentatious types have ceased, I'm still around, and doing, still, alright. In short, I'm calm and rational and stable - Or, well, I am, as much as I am able.     What Poetry Form Are You?

         I have been working on this journal for about two days now. I have been engrossed on all these html codes and all that is to learn about creating your own blog...self-study if you will. It's fun and very time consuming. But I have found yet another way of taking my mind off of things.    I had a particularly difficult time figuring out how to post images on my blog page. After all the painstaking research...eureka!

        Hello...This is my very first post. I don't know what came over me but for some reason I thought that I just needed something to express myself with. Something without any boudaries or limits. Something that could just express what I am feeling and let me be able to speak my mind. Just trying this out already makes me feel a little bit lighter. Just hope that whatever I type in here wouldn't get me into trouble in the future. So help me God.
