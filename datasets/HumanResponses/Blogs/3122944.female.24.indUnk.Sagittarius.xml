      Those who can't wed....Match!! ;)   I fancy myself quite the matchmaker actually.    I'm very happy to say that I do believe our matchmaking efforts out in Arizona are doing quite well.   And the 2 people that I "matched" online,  found each other, and are doing splendidly well.     So. Who can I match *you* up with?? ;)

      Upon looking at other's blogs, I have noticed that a lot of people like to stir up controversy and have rousing debates on their blogs.  Let me assure you I have absolutely no intention such a thing.   Anybody who knows me, knows I hate controversery of any kind, and the only debate I would ever initiate would be a debate of absolute nonsense. (what do you mean you don't like oreos, you insipid moron!?)   *ahem*  anyways,  I must leave now to go bond with my older brother over a pool table, where he will most likely beat the tar out of me, and I shall be shamed.  G'day.

      If you're here, then you  obviously  know me.  Therefore, it is  mandotory to comment.   Oh. Wait. I don't have comments.  Okay. never mind......It is mandatory next time to see me to quote me a line from Lord of the Rings, or if you prefer sing me your favorite song.   Yes, my name is Katrina, and this marks my 7th online journal.      I am sooo not addicted.

      I love email.  I must say, I am not very good at keeping up with it.   But every blue moon, I find a person that is just as random and strange as I am, and then I can't wait to receive emails from them!  The excitement mounts as you wait for their email to appear in your inbox because you're oh so very eager to see WHAT they said in response to yours!  Some people don't take very well to my randomized comments, and most give me the ol' "Boy, are you ever weird"  or they simply ignore them.  But not certain people!  And that makes it so very worth it.

      I do believe that there is nothing more distasteful than the act of packing up your place of living.     It is extremely hard to imagine that I, by myself, have accumulated this much stuff in the span of my short, steadily growing longer life.  But no matter how I look at it, I myself am the only one to blame.   It is now when I wish I lived in the wilds of Africa and lived in a one room hut. I could have been done a week ago.  But sadly,  I am still stuck in the 'burbs of Indianapolis, with way too much stuff.   Maybe this is the Lord telling me to put into practice what I learned at Urbana.  Simplify Simplify Simplify! ;)    For those of you who don't know,  and what's more probably don't even care, our house got hit by a tornado.   I, thank the Lord, was gone when this happened. Camping, no less. ;)  Anyways,  our house compared to all those around us, really was spared. But there are some major structural damage things done to my apartment, so I must pack up everything and camp out down at Mom & Dad's.   It truly doesn't look BAD from the outside, just.......weird.  I had at first thought that I would be able to just stuff everything in the kitchen, since to the human eye it appeared that only the one outside wall was damaged.   But to the non-human eyes (i.e., contractors and engineers) the "gable" was damaged and thus my apartment must be vacated.  Hence, this mad mad mad packing.   And I am so totally unmotivated for it.   Hence, here I am using my time MOST wisely by posting.  ;)

      Well, folks.&nbsp; It's official. &nbsp;I have mono.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; Monoeucliosis (sp?) from the Epstein Barr Virus. Otherwise known as the dreaded kissing disease.&nbsp; If you're asking yourself, how did SHE get the kissing disease?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, my dear friend (you don't mind if I call you dear friend, do you?)&nbsp; I've asked myself that question many times.&nbsp; Personally,&nbsp; I'm sticking with the story of the cute grocery boy in aisle 7.&nbsp; It's not true, but at least it makes a semi-interesting story! ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; At least more interesting than the probably one of 'I probably stood next to someone who coughed and I got it from that'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one's life is boring, one must add excitement.&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it's legal.&nbsp; (I had to put  that  disclaimer in there so that all the children who come upon this don't decide to lead lives of reckless disregard to the law because of my words!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow bubbles.&nbsp; It's fun and entertaining and hurts no one.&nbsp; But don't blow bubbles if your mother has told you to do something else!&nbsp; That would be bad.&nbsp; Not only for the good of mankind, but also for you. The bubbles will be even more fun after you have all duties done.&nbsp;&nbsp; How in the world did I get on this rant???)&nbsp;   *AHEM*   Anyways, I think I set a world record of hours slept over the weekend.&nbsp; I also have been going to bed at the  unheard  of hour of NINE.&nbsp; NINE!&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe it myself, folks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of which, look at the time.&nbsp; It is, my dear friend, 8:51.&nbsp; And I must, sad to say, leave you at this point and enter the world of dreams.&nbsp; I personally love the world of dreams.&nbsp; There's lots of Bubbles. *MINE ALL MINE!*   50 points to the person who knows what movie that is from!
