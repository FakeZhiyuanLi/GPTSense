      Good day, mortals. It seems that I have not been posting for quite a while for quite a good reason. Anybody watch the Memphis news? Or, even better, anybody in Memphis on Tuesday July 22? That's right. 100 mph straight line winds that snapped telephone poles like toothpicks and uprooted trees (the whole root systym) and knocked out the damn electricity for most of the city.  Fun galore. I am currently in Jackson, Mississippi, hiding from the boiling heat in the cool air conditioning of my granparents' home. Feel my power over nature.  I was flipping through this little poetry book I gave my granparents for a holiday and I am realizing how much the style I once adopted has changed. A sort of evolution, if you will. Somewhat weird. I felt it necessary to write for that reason.  By the way, this is to Elise, who dragged me from that mental wreckage I once found myself in.   A soul is sighing and crying alike Recollections of an old hand dancing Not dancing Stumbling along the computer keys Some edifice of a structured rhyming line Forgotten by now, an empty home When winds were whistling, I could hide there Light a candle Read Shakespeare Smell the hardwood floor and the aged sofa I won't return I have a new home to call my own My own Not my own, yours maybe I borrowed your style, tried to Loving thoughts that flow together Call it an emotion of jealousy Infused with that mindset of gratitude That is precise Gratitude for a rebirth Gratitude for a new awakening A renaissance, of sorts, for this time This time alone You brushed your pen across my eyelids And I inhaled alien air into my lungs A brighter poetry Where would my mind be if you had not Seen me Smiled Sat beside me in that classroom Called me up for a movie I feel that I am still wallowing An ocean of eternal undertow That's me See the speck in the blue, right there It's closer than it was Closer to shore Farther from drowning in despair and insanity Ani is there to comfort me, through my ears You are there to confort me, through my mind I feel newer I feel evolved Your friend believes I will do something Totally unexpected Entirely revolutionary Exploding from my silent cocoon I would not even be realized if I had not awoken You had not shaken my left shoulder and Pulled me onto the dance floor.   Ever realize how far you've gotten since a point? I was experiencing such.  Cheers, humans.

      Good evening, mortals. I feel regretful this evening. I posted a poem on the blog DOY in response to the prompt, but I felt bad about doing such, because it just....didn't.....flow. Alanna is angry-but-not-in-an-explosive-way at me for betraying the DOY code of never removing posts. Here is the dangerous poem that could strip your eyes of the retina if you read it too closely.    Unconsciously   Voice so tiny in the receiving end of a telephone Or binary code words slapped onto the white screen I can talk to you over a distance of wire and metal And I can know what you think You can tell me that you are writing or dancing To a selection of rock music that rolls through the speakers.  I just feel it can be so false When your eyes are not there, then, to assure me Of what you are thinking And how you breathe when you hear the telltale noise Or a shadow that moves in the living room.  It is then, fully awake That you are entirely conscious of what you want to think And thinking is not unconscious Realized as each thought forms gently Upon the breeze of memory and mind You dress as you feel your ideas And spontaneously call me up for a spin.  Insomnia, as defined by old Webster Chronic inability to fall asleep or remain so I find that you are the most random over the wires When you can’t fall into a dream But the dragging effect of fatigue pulls at your eyelids And you run tot he kitchen for a wake-up call.  Spontaneous, I say again A chain of random thought that ties itself in your mind Tired as it may be And we can speak, oddly, of blueberries and Monaco At the same time, with no transition.  I think you are lovely upon awakening Sounds odd, I understand But your voice is groggy over the phone wires And in that moment you can be undisturbed by life’s pain It is that carelessness that allows you to giggle From fatigue or wake dancing to the radio beats.  Sleep is a funny thing As I need my share, and you need yours We both despise the bloody activity Unconscious for several hours, laying sprawled in bed I hate just drifting off But I enjoy the effects of waking on your voice And your eyelids, when closed, are beautiful.   This is written to a "you", but I shan't state whom. It broke something of the fluidity on the DOY site; thusly, I deleted it. I did not like it posted. Odd feeling, but it has been eating at me all day.  Saw a movie entitled  The Royal Tenenbaums . Beautiful movie, really random, and from there comes the genius of it. Richard Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) and Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) are my two personal favorites: Richard, a tennis-playing suicidal hippie, and Margot, a smoking depressed adopted child, who turn out to love each other secretly. Lovely movie. Get it when you can.  I am currently reading  The Grapes of Wrath  for AP English class. It is a hell of a book, and it is hell in itself. Not very exciting, from what I have read thus far. But I shall triumph eventually.  Yoga class was cancelled. My first class. Unhappiness.  Cheers, humans.

      Good day, fellow mortals. I dropped by Alanna's blog (a letter from Memphis) and found this rather odd quiz concerning mental restrictions. Turns out I am pretty screwed-up after all.       Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    Moderate       urlLink Schizotypal :    Very High       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Moderate       urlLink Narcissistic :    Moderate       urlLink Avoidant :    Very High       urlLink Dependent :    Very High       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    High       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --       Interesting, I daresay. Also talking to Alanna about therapists. Seems that many people I know have seen a therapist once in their life.  Exciting stuff tonight. First yoga class, and I hope that it shall me exciting. I believe that yoga is a type of dancing that is expressed in a slower, graceful movement. Kinetic art. Beautiful stuff.  It rains at the moment, which makes my mood improve. Odd and confused as it is, I despise the sunlight and prefer night and rain. Yes, I assured every person reading this blog that I am a bit off my rocker.  Cheers.

      Good evening, fellow mortals. I am incensed due to the current health warning in my little part of the world. In accordance to the weather channel, the ozone layer is currently disintegrating like styrofoam. They state:  A CODE ORANGE HEALTH ADVISIRY IS IN EFFECT.   This translates as, "the ultraviolet rays that are seeping through the atmosphere are so damn intense that they can fry you like batter if you step outside for a long time." Fun time if you like skin cancer. I personally don't find the idea appealing. I am genetically inclined to that kind of stuff (cancer, etc.).  Can you say diesel fuel byproducts and artificial refrigerants? That spells CO, CO-2 and CFC.  I am not happy with the environmental situation. They really need to roll out the new hydrogen cars.  Cheers, humans.

      Fellow mortals, AP scores arrived today. For AP World History. Slit my throat now. Today's grade for the evil college exam from hell is ........................................... drum roll please ................................................................................................... 4. Out of 5. That is okay but, you know, still kind of disappointing. I was expecting to make a two.  Wasting my time today on worthless summer assignments.  The Awakening  (Chopin) is an okay waste of time, because it sparks the most minute amount of interest possible for a summer assignment. I would still rather be reading Francisca Lia Block. Poetry in written form. Not this formal fiction about an artist.  Oh, by the way, I have added several links to other blogs. To your right, you will find the link to Elise's blog (Just Dream),  not  to be confused with her site, when doves cry. Also you might find Brock's site (The Bat Cave) as well as the blog I have very recently become aware of, Zoë's blog (KiwiAGoGo). Have fun.  Cheers, mortals.

      Good day, mortals. I am about to get a car to use as though in my own possession! Feel the dynamic power held within the scraps of metal and twisted wires.  I had a rant last night. It was not fun. I dunno what sparked it entirely, but it was kind of disturbing and, you know, when your ranting you can get into it and hate it at the same time. I got to one part where I really upset myself, and I think that part should be interesting to post, but beware of the language and the emotions within it.   "...I wanted to cry like I want at Morgan Fox's poem, but I can't. I can't, goddamnit, because I am insensitive. Damn it, I can't feel anything, can I? People laugh and cry and react in ways I can't because I don't understand how. They feel things and I don't know how feel it. Why can't I feel things as an emotion? If someone died I wouldn't do anything...I can't cry or pain or pine or feel like other people unless it's fucking fear. Fear or anger. Mostly fear, which inspires anger. I hate being so fucking different. It's a sickness...I know that I hide it and and I hide all the goddamn emotions but it is still there like a goddamn parasite...I've been lying to myself I think..."   Written late late last night/early this morning, when I fell into the attitude. Won't say why. This did include some other people, and they played a big part in the rest of it. The whole rant theme was about fear. I am excluding those people and references thereof for reasons of my own choosing.  This is why I wanted people to be warned. Yes, I am probably borderline insane, so keep that in mind when reading. It happens and it is going to happen. It's inevitable.  Cheers, humans

      Good evening, fellow mortals. I am giving my random spontaneous thought. Here it is: Sweet Chili and Onion Thai Rice is very very good for a meal. Okay, let's move on.  Tonight was the open mic night at Java. We had two guitarists and many poets (Morgan Fox is, I steal the concept of Elise, a fucking genius poet). I was struck by how painful Morgan Fox's poetry was. Tarah read as well as Elise. Then there was a girl who poetized/improvised which was damn cool. I was planning to read the second prompt poem I wrote for Alanna (DOY) but, alas, I am such a damn coward in front of an audience. I did get ready to read though! It was simply a minute before open mic closed, and a bit too late. Now Elise and Alanna and Morgan Stewart and Zoë are prepared to murder me.   I am too fearful of people. Elise and I think it is because I don't trust people. I need to work on that. It restricts my poetry.  Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes. You can't get enough of them. (-Frank McCourt)  Here is the prompt poem I was going to read.   Look ahead Parallel lines wandering off in the distance Never meeting, so says geometry Lines painted by liquid silver upon a rough curved surface A metallic insect crawling on a track Wood and steel and stones to stand The iron driven deep into the living slats To hold the path together, a tie of sorts Euclid says that the lines will never, can never touch Look up The twisted set of human handiwork A factor that lifts the beast of terra creation To obey the will of the human sculptors That is physics 101 A triangle is the strongest shape arranged Into a tower that can't stand to the elements Gravity would drag it into an arch But cosmic laws say that it can stand Unlike the bending of a cardboard tube Newton says that gravity pulls downward Look around Walking with hands in pocket, down a trail To your left you see the future of this little disintegrating society Rolling off into the distance It's belching smoke into the atmosphere C-F-C's and C-O-2's The sun is growing more hidden each day Mental society breaking down Looking at this little human invention, a toy It's devouring nature at its own slow pace No sun, no air, no life Fuck this endless circle of death and decay When you are collecting two-hundred each time you pass go There goes another rainforest And when the last fish caught, the last tree cut The last animal stuffed and put on display Man will realize he can't eat money Look up again There is the sun, wallowing in an oily haze of pollution Look ahead again An incoming smog is rolling around Break-out the gas masks and the goggles We are getting to the place we are headed Dead-end, no passing go, collect your goddamn cash for the last time Only footprints left between the railroad ties.   It is rather angry and melancholy, but more angry than melancholy. Ever have that feeling that you are among the few who know what is actually happening to the earth when a diesel engine lets off a putrid cloud of black smoke? I am one of those. It really sucks too, because people don't see the importance. The earth is just a temporary resource to them, and when it dies, where will they go? WE DON'T LIVE ON A RENEWABLE RESOURCE PEOPLE, DAMNIT!  I apologize for my ranting. I shall fall silent. Cheers, humans.

      Evening, fellow mortals. I am not just a vampire anymore. Now, I am a vegetarian vampire. Feel the irony rush through your veins as though the very blood from which your life is created!  Today is rather a sad day, for my neighbors had to take their aged dog to the vet and have him put down. It was merciful to the dog, because he was steadily growing blind and he had several health conditions that caused him much pain. In addition, he was quite old, which made the health conditions even more dangerous. They put the dog down this morning, unless I am mistaken.   Wandering in a world of death and pain The society no longer wants emotion Feelings pump into the brain like living blood “Don’t show them, damn bastard It’s just a stupid feeling We do live in a time of inconvenience, you know” They was in self-convinced Reassurance Martyrs to themselves because they stay silent A heavier load upon the their shoulders each time They refuse to cry They refuse to speak Among the first to feel the emotional flood As it breaks the wall of the mind A torrent for long held within a feeble grasp They don’t cry, they don’t speak They’re in a mental institute now. Crystals forming upon the breeze Flowing The quartz is still a living organism too Unable to feel any emotion Save sadness, pain, agony It crawls down the cheeks from the eye corners Flies away on a zephyr before it touches earth The hosts from whence it came They feel They are upset over the world Pain and death that stole from their hearts Their minds weeping The emotional dam allowing a trickle A tear splashed upon the soil A life worth more than imposters of feelings.   Comment freely on this poem or the current state of affairs in your existence. If you were the friend of a canine who has passed away, then you must know how the trouble of this impacts your mind like the blow of a hammer.

      I believe I forgot several of me fellows on the post concerning Saturday July 12  Tila - a friend I met at Bridges, through whom I was introduced to Miles. She has her own special name for me - "Soft Hands". Self-explanitory. Though I suppose it is a matter of opinion. And she enjoys the rain to the same degree I do. She also frequents Java Cabana, the coffee shop.  Morgan - younger sister of Alanna, who joins the DOY poetry circle with her extreme randomness that I envy. I wish that I could mimic her extremely random thoughts, for I find them quite hysterical. Experience her on DOY. (see the link) And, by the way, she enjoys Saltine crackers and does not enjoy potatoes. And she is an actress and movie producer. Alanna will often touch up the films for a good performance.  Laylee - a photographer who is quite talented, who often includes Becca in her pictures. She too is in on the DOY poetry circle. Laylee is quite a charming young lady, and she is extroverted and fun to be around. I regret not knowing more about her.  Johnna - another friend I met through Elise. She lives quite a ways away in, I believe, Collierville, and she also is quite a charming young lady. I joined with Johnna to observe fireworks on the fourth of July. That was quite exciting.  Arthur - a fellow DOY posting poet who lives far away in I forget where - New Hampshire. He is a cool dude, if you will excuse my obsolete speech, and he is past the malicious high school experience. He is currently out of hell, and I believe he shall proceed to college. He is also a musician, like myself!  Cheers, my fellow mortals.

      Everyone must look in the Memphis paper today! Metro section, page B8, continued story from B5, prompt word "Concerts." Fucking yeah! There is Brock and Elise and Becca and they are frozen in time as they dance at a Violent Femmes concert. Look there immediately or I will smite you to the core of your being immediately for disappointing my fanatical mandates!     This is how you spell power, my fellow mortals. If you lack the Memphis Commercial Appeal, visit the site and look at the article concerning  urlLink Concerts  and feel the utter power of being immortalized in a picture that represents kinetic motion to the max.  I apologize for the extremely random behavior I just engaged in. But it was fun. You must feel the power now. Go and see at gomemphis.com.  Cheers, fellow human beings.

      Good evening, my fellow mortals. I had an excellent time this evening with my good fellow Elise. We talked randomly in Japanese and Spanish at Shelby Farms so that we could draw odd looks from passerbys and confuse each other thoroughly in this odd exchange of ideas. The moon looked huge as it rose while the sun set into the horizon.  Then we observed a show of Eddie Izzard. He, truly, is fucking insane, but he is an "executive transvestite", so do not mock him. He spoke about the empire of Hitler ("Nazi shithead") who ran into Russia like Napolean and received a nasty shock from the weather ("vegan Nazi shithead - would you like some human flesh? Tastes like chicken"). Then Izzard spoke of the ancient Roman gods: Geoff, god of biscuits, and Scott, god of hairdos. ("Cake or death?" "I want cake" "Give him his cake!")  My short story that I am working on currently is currently a load of BS. That is why it is 16 pages long, and it imitates a book I am made to read and study and utterly tear apart for AP English 11, because that is all we do - tear the book apart until it has no literary or intellectual value and is made into some damn life lesson. We murdered Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) last year; it has no appeal to me anymore. I killed it.  Poetry that I wrote randomly because I wanted to speak of this evening's events:   Two figures walking, conversing The intricacies of three random languages Hispanic Boy comments to Oriental Girl Commenting on the beauty of the sunset reflection Sitting to watch the final sunrays That ignite the clouds, flammable tender And the moon is rising, magnified.  Ocean of darkness plunging forth Torrents that have broken the resplendent dam Swirling 'round, the perfect tornado Spain and Japan hide in a two-story home Fucking ugly, with those malevolent spotlights Contemplate the dishes, from Third World or the East And chose the red rice While laughing at the bloody British.  Strawberry and a chocolate cream Lingering sensation But a memory on a tasteful palate Arguing over poetry and human imagination Arguing over the green paper strips, US religion Capitalist pigs that we are (Damn them all, boil the melting pot) Tori Amos flinging her notes carelessly to open ears.  A simple hug to show mutual respect The night air is growing cooler with the suspended pearl Quite a lovely evening The light kiss upon the left hand But surprisingly for the foolish hermit A kiss by the lips of the falling tear Shocked for a moment, temporary silence The sign returned to the right of the right eye Where she had fallen before.   Cheers, my fellow mortals. Have a lovely evening.

      Good evening, fellow mortals. I am demented enough to think that I am a supernatural being, and I am convinced by fellows of mine (e.g., Elise) that I am a vampire. There. That is the random thought for the day. No, actually, I have many more.  My good fellows are as follows: Elise - my patron goddess with silver wings. She rules the site  urlLink When doves cry . She is a poet and a writer and a graphic artist and she is an angel. She is also the only person I know in this little group that can drive alone.  Alanna - goddess/saint of computers that deserve to be damned to hell and back again. She is the supernatural spirit/janitor of the site  urlLink DOY . She too is a writer and a poet and her younger sister Morgan is also wicked at the visual and intellectual. Don't listen to Alanna when she says her poems are crap. They are not.  Brock - an acquaintance I have met through Elise and wish I could be around him more because he is an awesome guy and - you guessed it - a poet and a writer and a consummate graphic artist. You will go  urlLink to the Bat Cave  right now and see his blog. Brock speaks a wicked French tongue and he will move to France some day. He is a French god stuck in the US of A.  Becca - I do not know Becca all too well but I have met her through Elise and the whole DOY gang. She is a freaking genius on the guitar, I am establishing that fact right this moment. Meet up with her at  urlLink Cylindrical Poppycock and other Nonsensicle Things . And obey the word of the new rock goddess who posts on  urlLink DOY .  Zo&euml;- a dancer goddess. She cruelly made me dance for the camera when we were filming to make Elise and Brock feel guilty about deserting us for a small insignificant writing camp. She is hysterical. She lacks a blog location right now, but go to DOY and you can absorb the power of her poetry and writing.  Robin - she is not really a member of DOY but she has a profile there. Robin is the queen/goddess of the four young men who exist in all times as the Beatles. But do not say Paul McCartney in her presence. She will utterly smite you. Visit and see her disposition to our "beloved" McCartney.  urlLink The Evil Empire .  Tarah - a wicked spanish speaker, a wicked poet and a wicked artist. She is soo damn good at art it isn't funny. And she posts on DOY, and she is really a nice person to be around. She has not a blog address that I can post, for apparently there are so very many blogs that she owns.  David - okay, D-Dawg here doesn't engage in activities with the previously stated list of fellow poets and writers. In fact, he may hold a grudge against a few of them. (Not telling who....they know who they are). But David is still a cool Japanese-speaking dude. And he's Jewish too! And that leads me to matzos, which are also good. Sorry about that.  Miles - a recent friend that I have become acquainted to in a very short time. She went to Bridge Builders camp the same week I did and, despite the restrictions of different teams and all that, she and I are good friends. She wishes for me not to post the address of her blog. I honor that request. And, by the way, she's a poet!  Meg - a recent friend that I have become acquainted to in a very short time after an infinitly long time that I regret I did not speak to her. She and I are old friends from way back when...definately before school begins for children. She is so very kind and pleasant and sweet. She drives also. And, hot damn, she is a poet too!  Cheers, my fellow mortals. These are my companions. Have a nice evening. Or don't. But hurry and make up your mind.

      I have now bridged the gap between my isolated self and the technological world. I bid thee mortals a good day, and ask you kindly to play fair and not bombard my computer or url with any crude or virtually fatal thoughts. I don't know how it is done, but I know it can be done. Somehow. It might take several millenia to reach that point where I do know how it is done, but some day I shall access that supreme power.  My generally and currently empty mind is suffering from the strain of the blog and the html code and the computer that attempted to murder me and mutilate my body. I thank Alanna for kindly using her precious minutes to assist me in escaping hell in a handbag with my blog and my sanity intact. (Okay, the last item may have broken a few years ago, but who gives a damn?) You must go to the site she is the goddess and the janitor of.   urlLink DOY . Go there now puny human or I will track you down and smite you. It is a site that twenty poets and writers and artists post on and Alanna herself is a genius at the English language. I post my own work there sometimes.  I also have a patron goddess. That kind of thing has not been popular since the ancient Greek days but, hey, it could be the next fad. My patron goddess is the lovely Elise, and she has wings of mercury (quicksilver to the ignorant masses) and she has the ability to call upon divine force and smite you. In fact, she could probably get her divine friend Brandon to smite you too (he rules Canada currently but there are some believers in North United States and down here in Memphis Tennessee). Go to her site:  urlLink elise's site  or I will call her to smite you now. She writes poetry and novels and short stories and she is an angel genius. Go to her site now.  For your convenience, there are two little links at the bottom of this blog that will take you there immediately.  On a lighter note, I will be posting my poetry and/or compositions on this blog as well as on Alanna's site. In addition, the readers of this blog will have the pleasure of wading through the confused and sometimes poisonous swamp of my thoughts and emotions. Warning: The emotions and ideas floating around this site are the fatal and sometimes angsty feelings of a teenage boy who has the power to drive (but no car to exercise that in). Do not blame me if you soak up the thoughts like a plant and get many of the same ideas as I do. These thoughts will often be sad or deal with isolation and loneliness and this little thing I like to call insanity.  Just to reassure you: I am not suffering from insanity. I enjoy every minute of it.  Yes I speak to the outcasts and the pariahs and the isolated people of society: I am one of you. Cheers, my fellow human beings.

       Somebody tell me, Why I can't react to thoughts of separation To thoughts of death Thoughts of suicide No fear or hate A mental dusk falling Falling So many feet per second So many at once Somebody explain, Why when I get close to the Grand Canyon And look over the edge Or stand on a highway shoulder and squint As a thousand suns glare past me Why do I have the urge The inside urge The unexplainable, insatiable curiosity To jump Trip, fall Into the earth scar or onto the asphalt Just to see what would happen Maybe I am dreaming more than my mind Enjoys now I haven't dreamt in my sleep They're making up in waking Wandering In a half-stupor Wondering which way to turn Looking from a tower upon literally Thousands of lives Striding about in self-assurance I want to fall Feel the wind pulling at my ears Though I could never plunge from High diving board Low diving board Fear of height, to an extent, But fear is what kept the early man alive I think I can't feel it for what matters Or maybe I don't think Maybe it's all an instinct Someone tell me, Am I the only one who has These irrational fits of mood Even though No, no one, no psychiatrist Ever diagnosed me? Perhaps its a mental disease no one Found It's been almost a day since I had a cheerful idea No nightmare No dream Just dreary reality That sucks the imagination from Everything Don't hate me Don't pity me I just want an answer Life is like insulin Hate it, but can't do without it Take what you got Even if you never wanted it Somebody tell me Who I am And am I now?

      Good evening, mortals. I sincerely apologize for my lack of posting over the past few days. I have been busy dying in a flurry of English literature essays, Biology enzyme papers, and Calculus...er...calculations. But Calculus, despite the constant vigilance it requires, goes rather well methinks. I find it quite enjoyable, to the dismay of several of my colleagues.  Becca and I spoke today about significant figures in chemistry, because significant figures are    THE MOST VAGUE    sectors of science in general. She figured them out without my assistance. I was useless (oh well).  I can see Elise and Laylee daily now! Indeed, I am permitted to see Elise early in the morning at school because I get to the school building earlier, and I may see Laylee following lunch period C when she is leaving AP English and I am heading towards mathematics. Happiness, I daresay.  I should like to post a prompt poem that is utterly crap. I posted it on DOY because Alanna demanded that I do, and I dare not deny her. But it is crap. The prompt was "[   ] is a lazy hush fuck", "Danish cookies", and "NOOOOOOOOOOOO" (count the O's damnit, they count!)  This thing got 74 comments. But a majority of them were the ramblings of Sirs Jerel and Nick of California. I am confused with Sally, so some people might think of me as female. But I am not! I am male! I won't prove it right now, but take my word for it.

      Becky has a blog! Becky has a blog! Sorry about that.  Good evening, mortals. Note the two new links on the side of the website. Numero uno, note the new  urlLink American Pi . A wondeful site, I should say. But be wary what you find there. Your mind might split like a cantaloupe.  Second it is Becky Becky Becky's blog because I told her she needs a blog and who cares that she doesn't have anything to put on it? Go there now lest I smite thee.  urlLink Becky's Mind . hehehehe everyone really is on a blog these days.  I saw the crew this afternoon turning south onto White Station. Specifically, Laylee and Becca. Cue the twilight zone music. Actually, it was in mid-turn that we saw each other and waved frantically. It was fun.  Cheers, humans.

      My error. I forgot to mention the large storm that attempted to murder everyone again. It was, in the terms of my colleagues, the superstorm's ghost. It rolled around at roughly 12:00 this morning (yes, midnight) with 40 mph winds and tried to kill eveything but, since it was a wimpy storm, it only shut off the power from a few places. Of course, no one in the US will hear about it because NO ONE HEARD OF IT IN THE FIRST PLACE ON JULY 22! Of course, everyone knows about New York (bitter mumbling).  Mars is supposed to be closer to the earth tonight than it has been in 60,000 some odd number years. The ruby of earth's neighbors. Or the rust spot. I like to think of it as the ruby. Look for it tonight, chaps, it supposed to be a wonderful view.

      Good evening, mortals. It durst seem that school has slowly been sipping my life force like a vodka martini (shaken, not stirred). I have suffered mental anguish because I almost die in AP Biology due to fatigue and almost die in Economics due to frostbite. Seriously, you try to sit in that portable for an hour each day, and Memphis's ozone-depletion hundred-degree weather will be paradise. At least for a few minutes.  I suffered from that malicious sickness that seems to be floating around. Headaches and fever and stomach cramps and all that fun stuff. It made me miss more enjoyable ventures on Friday night. Disease and work sucks.  No one is online right now, and I am alone and isolated and angsty and suffering from another of those funny mood swings that happens spontaneously and screws up my entire emotional balance. That sucks too. Mood swings. Yep.  Poetry, or conscious thought stream, whatever you want to call it, is good for the creative spirit.    Democracy   My stomach seems to have been empty for the day after I slept sprawled on the sofa with aches lacing my boiling blood, empty like my eyes because I couldn’t see the green light when it flashed at that intersection and that was near where you died, wasn’t it and near where your broken body made me want the cold lead to silence the screaming headache a shifting weather barricade has formed, winds sound again like an ocean wave, trying to uproot oaken toes and fig-laden leaves in a tornado that cracks power lines like cracking that false mentality of safety I believed in when I was a child, the mentality that it was all going to be okay. But it wasn’t, it will never be for me when my life is spent running not from the dark but running from what hides in it like a virus, a virus that affects gays and agnostics and blacks and people who are so damn “different,” the KKK clans, Bellevue and them proper folks who is as straight as a warped board hate them because they represent the principle outside and beyond black chains of slavery and prejudice and centuries that cry Democracy, Republic while slitting the throats of those who knew what each false word meant, and I can say honestly that I fall under a mass generalization that has been looked over for a time. I call it adolescence, when our hormones flood our brains with a drug more potent than any illegal shit that is sold bootleg in the alleys, when our minds want to find clarity but instead we find that expectation to live up to or to make up for or to do, just do it and get it over with, here’s the article about it and here’s a condom, no, forget the condom and go fuck up your life any way you want or you aren’t popular, it’s unfair, is it not dear, but c’est la vie and we’re stuck in knee deep mire and don’t breathe, you might catch my illness or my insane ideas of a neutron star wormhole that could go back in time to when things were…were different, but were they ever changed and how much has the human race evolved to when the power is in the paper and I may not roll into my car seat and pave the streets with new views as I hold your back as I would hold a budding sunflower who won’t open her petals to sunlight.    I bid thee humans a pleasant evening. Go to sleep.

      Good evening, mortal beings. It just so happens that car permits go on sale tomorrow at school which means hell trying to get one, the f***ing line will be stacked up to the outside of the room and it is a big room, allow me to assure you.  Alanna was absent today because of some damn virus thingie and it was upsetting because Alanna is a vital part of the little group that coheres during C lunch. It sucks already that Robin and Elise are separated by being in A lunch and Laylee is in B lunch. My schedule hates me, it wishes to murder me softly.  Elise wrote this wonderous but quite upsetting "scene," if you will, a concept that she thought of from the opinion of a third person observer. It is utterly beautiful, I assure you, but do not read it is you disturb easily from emotional content. This thing is packed to the brim with imagery and poetry. You may see it at  urlLink  Crash  by Lise .  In addition, I wrote a type of thought stream in response to it. I would not have posted it anywhere but I was tormented by Alanna and urged by Elise so I posted it on  urlLink A Dream of You  and here.   Heart Strain  An emotion of fear unexplainable infiltrates the cavity where my heart used to beat in a monotonous repetition, your voice is high and happy and excited somehow even as you are explaining your own death to me when it happened on the corner and I ran to your bloodstained body as it drained of life on the concrete, horrified to see even in my mind the image of you thrown from the tangled wreck of tin and aluminum, a red ink seeping from your arms, your stomach, your eyes, your lips twisting in unaccountable pain and a calmer smile in sleep, sleeping when the siren is wailing right around the corner, sleeping in a birth paradox, my fingers are stiff with fear gripping the cold plastic of a cell phone like a lifeline when I reach for the hand palm-upwards in a puddle of rainwater, and who gives a damn if I don't have the black umbrella, I need to protect her body from the crystals that fall from the clouds that might, just might be so precise as to release a more spiritual energy back into her cold body, her shivering body - oh God - it's not shivering anymore and the phone is just plastic and unfeeling when I grab her hand and hold it to my chest, driving the tiny shards of glass deeper and deeper into my bloodstream, let them poison my heart so I can accompany her like a guardsman sentinel of a goddess angel when she is slipping into the sleep she wants I want we want but it's not her life, it's just the dial tone and I have the urge to kiss you on the forehead, on the hand, on the lips to assure you are still walking with me.   Assuredly, it is rather odd because it is so very different. I swear, my "style" of poetry/writing has evolved, if you will, so very much in the past few weeks. That is all. A few weeks. And it is already so very different. Not the style that is most widely accepted, but nonetheless, I think, effective.  I bid thee humans a lovely evening. Everyone should try to meditate tonight. It is most enjoyable.

      Good day, mortals. I should like you to note that I manipulated my previous post to have a version of the Spanish poem with better grammar and correct vocabulary. Have fun with it.  Today was a rather uneventful. Calculus was good because of a maliciously evil test that I passed rather well. English was hell because of a maliciously evil test concerning the Grapes of Wrath applied on an AP level. Absolute insanity there. I shall never pass the AP exam.  Today we had another prompt from  urlLink A Dream of You . My resulting poetic attempt is entitled  Anticipate    Nature can live in the breast of a bird when it first spreads its honeycomb bones or it dies in an agonizing suffocation if a tendril of smoke leaks from a nearby factory to replace its dioxide but a chain has somehow formed around free will’s neck and I can no longer choose how I want to suffer.  The congress passed a few bills that don’t let a person slit their own throat or drink poison, it’s all illegal and against the law and if the cyanide doesn’t allow him freedom of choice then he goes straight to jail for attempted sanity.  Ringing on the pavement the dry sound of rubber in a battle of friction and resistance against asphalt and gravity, shoes that died with their owners are trying to pave a path back into Gaia, and their ghosts wander aimlessly in a delirium of real-world light and shadow world whispers.  Each person I run into feels like a shower of dry ice that never quite made it to sublimation and their skin is chilled with the temperature of a netherworld prison, each one of them is as dead as my mind tells me I am, though it still feels the cold.  There is a child who is sitting on the statue over there of a famous person who fought for pride who got off the ride who took the cyanide who found that in a frenzy of government she still cried when every man, woman, youth walking by her had eyes front, legs stiff because each of their minds were wiped from any suggestion of emotion.  The child can cry too but the child isn’t really alive, he wants to be but the shackles set by society are chafing his ethereal wrists and he isn’t free to join his God, his Allah, his Yahweh while the adamant scroll believers turn their head the other way and preach about the institution, not the principle.  Chipped into a stone that was thrown into an ocean a paranoid fool wrote Not Free, Not Free without the realization of what his mind would realize when a sky parted at the rift of time and the next black hole began to form.   Shorter than what I have done of late, but it suffices. i bid thee, mortals, a pleasant evening to-night. Cheers.

      Evening, mortals. I am currently feeling so drastically alone because no-one, in all seriousness, no one is online at the moment. Isolation is depressing.  It just so occurred that the birthday itself was uneventful. Little brother got a wad of cash that he blew almost immediately on a collection of gaming equipment and Legos. The cake was very tasty though. Strawberry cake. Like a strawberry daiquiri that I drank tonight. Which I drank with the knowledge that it had nooo alcohol and while I was realizing that I would see nobody tonight which created a slight depression that I am reminded of while I pound the keyboard keys.  My car passed inspection. Whoopdie freakin' do.  Señor Espinosa, the teacher of my Spanish class, called today. It was a rather odd moment; I could hear his voice well enough with ten feet of space between me and the phone. But it was pleasing, because he complimented my assignments that I turned in early. He called me to compliment me. That is not something you usually hear of. I think he appreciates me due to a diagnostic test score that I recieved in his class.  The poem that I gave him follows thus:    Goteando veneno   Viendo la gente que predica y habla y Cree en comprensión sincero, me hallo Situado fuera del círculo de conocidos Unidas por manos de confianza y Esperanza porque todos mis emociones y Mi mente están vacías.  La explicación práctica que mis padres y La siquiatra ofrecerán siempre sugiere Que soy un adolescente, solo un adolescente, Mis hormonas son confusas con un cuerpo Creciente, pero sé que algo es diferente Debajo de la piel, lo sé mientras se arrastra Más lejano dentro.  Oigo un grito de los corazones de Estrellas yendo nova, porque ellas no se dan Cuenta de nada ni sienten sus muertes, ni Sienten sus miedos. También tengo miedo Porque cada persona muere solamente Y mi vida es sólo una gota de agua en el Tiempo.  Todo el mundo que conozco tienen un Objeto como ayudando o doliendo pero Tengo aún que encontrar qué red está Tocando mis amigos a mis dedos. Se Hace una telaraña cada momento que Agito una hebra.  Me siento como un dios azteca, mirando a Mis hijos que se demacran de enfermedad y Dolor mientras los caudillos tienen fusiles A sus frentes y tienen que creer en un dios Diferente antes de que sus cerebros sangren De unas balas.  En mis palmas, vida y cordura son como Mercurio, como agua. Pero el agua no tiene El veneno en mis vasos.  El veneno en mis vasos, sí.  La carretera desaparece rápidamente en Obscuridad mientras llantas cantan sobre Asfalto. Mi mente es también obscura Porque mis manos sangrando conducen La rueda delantera ya que estoy corriendo De los peligrosos pensando, y sé que Soy un fugitivo.  Larvas de desesperación están creciendo Y tengo miedo de sus formas adultas, cuando Rompen sus conchas y florean como flores Con dientes de dolor. E hilarán los telarañas Entre los dedos de mis amigos y tendré miedo De nuevo, pero esa vez será más real.  Puedo olvidar la red y los larvas cuando Escribo o cuando escucho a la música Que hiela el veneno. Y las estrellas no gritan Ahora, ellas suspiran.   It naturally has a few mistakes in it, as I do not live as a translator. However, Sñr Espinosa thought it was lovely; he wished to know if I also wrote in English. In addition, he wishes that I translate a report on Peru and read it to the class. He is quite a pleasant Cuban.  If you desire the close translation of this poem, simply ask me.  I bid all of thee a good night, humans.

      I am increasingly hating that last poem I posted on DOY and my blog and, apparently, so does everyone else. No one has touched it because it is a gruesome butchery of poetry and I need to apologize for it. I shall ask Alanna soon if I can delete it. Totally remove it. That sounds correct.  Little brother's birthday today, he turns eleven and gets a load of cash that I envy. Lucky foolish child, he gets his birthday when he is around everyone else he knows. I had my birthday trapped at Bridge Builders. Not fun.  Today's random quote which made me come here and post: "The English don't necessarily pronounce everything right. They just say it the loudest." Said by Miss Lovely British Accent Janet Baker-Carr. I love the British accent and vocabulary. She asked me if my school bade ill for the rest of the year. I will steal her voice one of these days.  You know what I forgot to mention on accounts of Becca? Morgan Fox opened the night with beautiful poetry. He played few wicked pieces on the synthesizer and it was quite melodious and fluid and enrapturing.  I can't see my companions today due to "family matters", i.e., a birthday, but I shall have to talk to some of the later to reaffirm my sanity or lack thereof.  Cheers, humans.

      Good evening, mortals. Enter and bow to the superior, potent influence of a new god. BECCA ROCKED THE WHOLE DAMN JAVA CABANA! She is a budding rose in the art of guitar-ism and musicianship; her songs are among my favorites right now in my experience with rock; she is one of the top five artists I listen to. Why in bloody heck has she not created a compact disc and distributed it. I personally would be buying one of the first copies.  It was quite odd tonight. So many damn people came that I knew  personally  that I frightened myself. There was the whole "group": dancer Elise, artisan Brock, photographer Laylee, computer queen Alanna (who I drove to get her camcorder thingie), filmer Katherine, programmer Zoë (who is currently working on her laptop). Then there was a host of people I knew and did not know. Christie, Margaret, Robin, Katherine (Warren), Nick (who - would you believe it - was on my soccer team back when), Lauren, Aaron (Elise's brother) and Bethany (Elise's brother's "soul match"). And then there was Miles! From Bridge Builders! It was wickedly fun to see her again.  But Becca kicks buttocks. That's all that is to it. Of course, so many people were stuffed like sardines into Java around Becca that the room heated up with the millions of heat photons bouncing around. But hell! it was awesome.  The poem I posted of late did not recieve positive reviews. I shall have to re-analyze my style, for that one seemed a bit choppy. Naturally, some people were not to happy about the imagery in the last paragraph. I mean, who would be? It certainly ain't looking at a cracked glass half-full, now is it?  You are all humans (save those few gods that I have specified in earlier posts or never at all). Thus, you must acknowledge the supreme melodic dynamic that Goddess Becca holds with the potential of smiting or destruction.  Cheers, chaps.

      Good evening, mortals. It durst strike me that I have not posted in quite a quantity of time. I have been struck with the minor issue of summer assingments compounded with the new school year at White Station High Prison (f***ing da** son of a b**** of a school - sorry about that). My schedule is quite evil, it despises me, I don't get enough of those with connections to DOY because I see Robin in Economics, Brock in Engish, Alanna and Becca at Lunch, and NOTHING OF ELISE OR LAYLEE ON A REGULAR BASIS! damn school system  Upperclassmen get their own lockers - I have the power.  Tomorrow is Becca's kick-ass gig at Java. She is the main attraction, she has her own time and place, and every person who knows her well will probably be there. Even those who don't know her well might be there (e.g., me). I just have to escape dinner and I am there for the action. Par-tay, I daresay.  DOY's server is finally back online, which is a thing that is quite happy. At least I have some connection in my screwed up isolated touch-tone dead end life.  I wrote another poem with the intention of mimicking that which I wrote for the last post.   Hallways stretch in multiple turns that fold back upon human cholesterol, membrane walls in a Golgi apparatus that resembles the cross section of a color- coded blood cell in page who-gives-a-damn of my biology textbook.  Sometimes the graphite scratches on notebook paper ooze red ink like the educational ichors staining the white lines. Odd how it is that even as a sheet of papyrus wipes out a rainforest and kills count 100, 200, 300 species it can still find the strength to make a neat slit on the end of my index finger.  The only places you can find legal euphoria these days are Nevada, California, Oregon: the Rockies don’t need pimps as long as the prostitutes sign their forms and bars give you a shot of oxygen for a healthier intoxication.  Cascade Mountains have plenty of shrinks who help you get the suicidal medicines when the Pacific rains begin to hurt the mind, I am still waiting on the inclement weather perfect for my next evolution.  I scream toward the light post from the safety of locked doors just to reaffirm that I have a voice, I have a voice, but I’ve forgotten how to use it when the world dances in a crazed fury of pollution and suffocation and dreams are shattered like ice.  Warrior three pose resembles a cloud leap suspended over one knee and monks in Asia undergo brain readings for beta waves but I can never meditate for more than ten minutes, my senses stay alive and every pause of the air conditioner springs the mentality from caramel visions.  Forgetfulness would be more bliss than I can get when I wander hunched over with one pendant of books and another of socialistic response, people expect my shoulders to be thrown back with pride when gravity becomes a foe.  My legs have weeds slowly crawling up, caresses of a seductress who gnaws at my sanity. I stumble in a corridor where sexuality just killed sense by strangulation and the ominous perfume of illegal cigarettes of tobacco, of pot, of whatever the hell can be used to bong chokes my supply of air.  Dreams can be nightmares, but I have almost no night escapades to reassure me that I am not in a coma. When he dances, she dances, my heart begins to breathe and I can clear my eyes of iodine and dishonesty to hear sweet sighing of a guitar string.  I sometimes pretend I lie in a huddle with a pool slowly spreading from my wrists, I can draw the image now and tear it up because she sat next to the Random Information Guy giggling and opened my brain with aloe vera fingers to explore my religion of angst and change.   No title for a reason, chaps. Such can make it so very beautifully random if it has no title.  I bid every one of thee a good night, humans. Sleep well in the bliss that allows you to miss school (f***ing da** son of a b**** of a school - sorry about that). Evenin'

      Good evening, mortals. Thus far, the poetry I posted yesterday has gotten excellent reviews from Elise, Alanna, and Zoë, despite the extreme randomness and the very odd structure. I dunno about the style. Very odd.  I have recently seen two movies that I very adamantly suggest that everyone see. One is  Donnie Darko , which is so neurotic and freaky and fucked-up that it is frightening. Really. I mean frightening, it has a demented bunny rabbit guy in it named Frank who looks like he was hit with a truck on the face, and it deals a whole lot with time travel, which confuses me to the extreme. The second movie is  G.I. Jane , which is a righteous babe-type film concerning the first woman in the Navy Seals. It has actress Demi Moore, who shaves her head for the military and bulks up with some huge quantity of muscle. I have a new favorite actress.  Met up with Elise, went to the library, and listened for about thirty minutes to an elderly man chew on his dentures. So we left there and walked in Shelby Farms, then proceeded toward a television to watch  Donnie  and set off to Japanese food. Quite fun, I daresay.  Cheers, humans.

      Good day, mortals. I am returned from my college touring trip. A day early. We toured an entire two colleges - Sewanee and Vanderbilt. Sewanee is very lovely and bucolic and would allow great study but is rather restrictive in terms of a social life and solitary time. Vanderbilt is huge with many study possibilities and a rich social culture but it lacks the chance to really know the people on campus.  I have missed so very many of my companions of late. One young lady friend called me Tuesday before I left and wished to see me, but, alas, I was about to depart. Sadness. I hope to see her extremely soon. Possibly in school.  Which also sucks. School. It's about to begin in four damn days. Four damn days of working my butt off to finish the summer assignments I waited to begin because I am  Master Procrastinator . I shan't enjoy it.  A few days ago an asshole with a Ph.D. or an M.D. plowed my mother's car on the right side because he refused to obey the traffic rules. Fucking moron. Refused to stop at the dead light (review the Tennessee driver's handbook for dead lights) and plowed into the passenger side. With my brother in the passenger side. Luckily, it was a Volvo, and the steel beams prevented that door from entirely collapsing. Brother went to the hospital for minor facial injuries, but he's okay. The asshole is trying to say it was the light's fault, after changing his story from saying that he entirely stopped. (Bullshit-o-meter is rising).  Poetry while riding the road to Nashville. It was an attempt to mimic a fellow DOY member's style (Brandon; kudos to his poetry) with a mix of my own inspiration. So, it probably sucks. But I need opinions. Comment on it.   A rain haze hangs over the asphalt and i am forcibly reminded how death-like, how creepy horror-film scenario the road is looking, the sky is aglow in the west with a space-thrown candle light.  The horizon around the sun's eye is a deepening blue with a robe of strata cloud grimacing at the plants, and an intermittent rain begins to speckle the glass shield in tiny droplets of transparent quartz. Black tires are kicking water from the highway onto the car's rubber fingers.  Delta plain is fading into the rolling foothills that reach dry arms to drink from star light. I am noticing a pinkish glow to the starboard side of the music highway, flowing in gentle undulations.  Scores of notes rise in a passionate agony because a lovely lesbian can't take the fucking government that disintigrates economy like bleu cheese. I want to pull off the thoroughfare of living because I have a headache of sinus and anger and I want to think about it and take a still nature photograph.  Exxon spilled a few million gallons of oil on seabirds and fish and pretended that it never happened. The restroom is exactly what you expect at a gas station and smells of cancer stick fumes and stale urine, the woman who sells banana-flavoured Laffy Taffy at the glass counter fires back at the regular unshaven clients.  A piece of shattered glass is lodged in my left eye and another in my left aorta because little Bro and Mother were ploughed in the side by a Ph.D. bastard. She's been crying and Bro had on a neck brace, the Volvo is dying in a tow lot.  Piles of broken crystal fell onto them when beams of solid steel bent inward and the door of the glove compartment snapped.  The phone told me today that she had a dream where Apologetic Boy and a builder loved each other and twisted lips into sneers at Little Miss Rent and Detective Photographer tapped her shoulder and it's a prophecy I don't believe in because I'm washing away my palm's lifeline and I like Little Miss anyhow.   Okay, humans, I am off to eat rice. I hope to visit Java Cabana tonight for possibly the last open mic night before school, but if no one also drops by, I shan't.  Cheers, mortals.

      Feeling bloody depressed about now. Don't know why. I really think that I may have some chemical imbalance, because this feeling of general worthlessness occurs far too often for my liking. No, I wouldn't say worthlessness. Just...nonexistence almost. Like nothing means anything. Well, perhaps, a bit of worthlessness; I've been feeling lately that I really am of no value to anyone. What are my purposes? Learn language and play music. Like that ever helped anyone. Shit. Maybe I am just crazy.  I feel like screaming. But I can't. Nowhere to scream.  Perhaps I take things far too seriously. I don't know, a friend of mine was angered at me today - pretending, I know, she was simply imitating anger. But maybe I unconsciously took it as a reality. Or maybe it is just watching those sad type movies, like Lord of the Rings (I know...initially, what is it but a bunch of fat hobbits? But the concept is rather upsetting if you truly grasp it). Perhaps that rubs off.  What in hell is wrong with me? I don't think I have mood shifts. A whole bunch of depression lately has been crowding in. I need to talk to someone.  I can't sleep now because of too many dreams. Remember that late post about no dreams at all? I wake up dead-tired because my brain has been dreaming all night. So maybe I am just tired. Or stressed. No, scratch that, I haven't had any work this week at the educational prison.  Bah. Human nature sucks.

      Okay, chaps, methinks that last night's post deserves some explanation.  As you may have read in comments before, Rachel has visited my site (how in the world she got the URl, I have no idea), and, consequently, I have been to her site, and, thus, I am now a member of that community. There really is no other reason. Just trying to distribute crazed ideas like a plasmodial slime mold.  Love that imagery , don't you?  Just returned from a talk about witchcraft at the Universitry of Memphis. Rather interesting, I daresay. There was a short professor who was brilliantly funny, and everyone loved listening to him speak about witchcraft and wizardry in Europe between 1450-1750 (C.E.) because he made it so humorous. Let's go drink some hallucinogen potion. Right now. Get your vacuum cleaners, becuase brooms are so out of date these days.  I died in English today. Speaking about...what was it?...Cystic Fibrosis, I think. Yep, that essay utterly destroyed my body, mind, and soul.  We have a new DOY member! Bethany Chang from Nashville, a fellow of mine from the days of Mr. Stress-Syndrom Jackson, joins us with her writings and poetry. See her now, fools!  urlLink DOY .  Cheers, mortals.

      Oh this controls my existence. Small-price spacecraft, yo.   The original idea of a space elevator is more than a century old. In 1895, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, a Russian visionary who devised workable ideas for rocket propulsion and space travel decades before others, proposed a tower thousands of miles high attached to a "celestial castle" in orbit around Earth, with the centrifugal force of the orbiting castle holding up the tower. (Imagine swinging a rope with a rock tied to the end of it.)   But the idea was fundamentally impossible to build. Steel, then the strongest material known, was too heavy and not strong enough to support that weight.  The discovery in 1991 of nanotubes, cylindrical molecules of carbon with many times the strength of steel, turned the idea from a fantastical impossibility to an intriguing possibility that could be realized in as little as a decade or two.    Centrifugal force, you see. The end of it would swing outward, defying the earth's gravitational pull. Walk along a few carbon sidewalks and get to the moon.  urlLink Here 's a bit more, future astronauts. Can you say "obsolete rocket"?  Cheers, mortals.

      Okay, chaps, several fellows of mine that you might not know have been commenting lately. So here they are:  Miss Becky - I have introduced her before. Just to remind you that Miss Becky goes to school at White Station Prison; she shares my pre-Calculus class, and has several of the same teachers I have. Her blog is at my right,  urlLink Broken Shadows . Just as a little reminder. She needs visitors.  Miss Heather - a fellow I met through Elise. Heather is a face that torments me constantly because I swear I have seen her before, but I just can't place her. Creepy stuff. She is a very lovely young lady, and I appreciate her muy much. And now,  urlLink Ladies and Gentlemen, Heather! .  Miss Rachel - she dropped by earlier to comment and I never credited her for that. Rachel also joins me at White Station Prison; she is in the AP Biology class and the pre-Calculus class, and also has several of the same teachers I have. You might have heard her name on Brock's blog. She posts her  urlLink Ramblings of a Very Lost Being .  Miss Katherine - I cannot provide Katherine's blog because, as far as I know, she doesn't have one. But Katherine also goes to the same hell I go to, and I know that she is a very pleasant person to be around. And she plays drums! Happiness. She is in the same "group", if you will, of rebellious teenagers that Brock, Alanna, and sir Kevin are a part of (you don't know Kevin. I don't know him well either. But he is also a nice fellow).  And now, to other subject matter... Which doesn't really exist.  It rains right now. Like it would in Scotland. Okay, I know that is getting repetitive, but I hate being in the warm, sunny South. I want dark, rainy Ireland. Or Scotland. And Katherine's mom teaches Gaelic! Very very positive. Maybe I can strike a deal with her. Puirt-a-Beul.  I actually remembered a dream last night for the first time in several months! It was wonderful, knowing that I actually dream (I think that Brock arranged it with the cosmos). And it was such a lovely dream too, but I won't go into detail, lest you be angered with my subconscious. But it really was a lovely dream, and a wonderful one to remember.  I must go kill myself with Biology. Cheers, mortals.

      I have just been to the Celtic heaven and returned to tell the mortals about it.   urlLink     The Dòchas! (Pronounced Da-zchas). Five lovely ladies from about Scotland. Five damn talented ladies I should like to say. As in each girl could play three different instruments, in addition to vocal talents. I personally enjoyed the lead singer (Julie M Fowlis) and the fiddler (Jenna Reid). God, why couldn't I marry all five of them and accompany them back to Scotland? I am American capitalist pig. I want to be Irish fluter/bagpiper Gaelic-linguist. Curse that the fates be so cruel!  Speaking of which... I have decided to become, in addition to a microbiologist, a linguist (fluent in French, Spanish, Gaelic, and a variety of other instruments) and a musician (piano, bagpipes, fiddle). Time it seems might prevent this before college, but oh well.  Listening to a divine song by the Dòchas: Waulking Song. I will track down Julie Fowlis just to hear this. I am babbling, am I not? Go to  urlLink The Dòchas , you poor soul who has not heard Celtic jigs and melodies.  I will create a time rift that allows me to return to the past and relocate my parents to Ireland for my birth. Then I will be brought up speaking Celtic and playing fiddle. And I will be content all my existence. Hopefully. (Like that will happen. I am damned as a capitalist pig.)  Cheers, mortals.

      Okay, allow me to rant for a moment on a subject I was speaking to Alanna about.  Here's the thing: I know we're teenagers. I know where and when we are in our lifecycles; we are at that unfortunate conjunction between kiddie-hood and adult, a point at which our superiors demand responsibility and respect and understanding. And we are supposed to become "adults" ourselves. But let me propose this question. How are we to make time for the adult's activities of self-development when, as it is, we are buried in school and, if that isn't enough, we have our own developing lifestlyes, thank you very much. We are confused because, here, we are pressured to be the best, because we are aging, and look at your older sibling who was so perfect! (Ask Elise). On the other hand, we have those people - many of the same people who say that we should be responsible - who look at us [teenagers] like scumbags, beating us down because, hey, we're not even adults yet. Getting the dramatic contradiction?  This means that teenagers sometimes just can't do everything that is expected of them, especially when their environment is bearing down on their shoulders with raised hackles. I have a younger sibling (thank you very much), and I  cannot  take care of him every second of his/my existence. Why am I expected to "play fair" and "be nice" and "treat him like an equal" when he is doing his best to make me mule-kick him? Unfair circumstances can revolve both ways, remember that.  Another thing. Not all teenagers are alike. We are not all shoplifting, pill-popping, weed-smoking, sex-driven beasts. Albeit, there are some of those base creatures crawling the earth's surface without right. Those are some of the people you can find in the penitentiary or on the streets, robbing old ladies and raping young ladies and killing ladies and men and laughing about it. But teenagers are not all the same. If we were, - face it - the population of teenagers would be much more organized, much more determined, and much more violent towards its greatest threat (three guesses who I am talking about and the last two don't count). Not all of us hide in the school bathroom rolling illegal drugs during the lunch period. Not all of us carry knives in our side pockets with a lonely person's name etched onto the blade. Not all of us fuck like rabbits and have children before age thirteen. No,  some  of us do have morals, believe it or not. In fact,  some  of us actually do value thinking and education over sex, drugs, and rock-'n-roll (or, in modern vernacular, fucking, stoning, and rapping).  Here's your handy translation guide for this (with respects to Alanna). Co-gender sleepovers are not for all-night copulation. When we look at an item in a store, we are not stealing it. Parties don't always have booze. As it is now, our only accepted way of self-expression seems to be rebellion, which isn't that widely appreciated. But what can we do when we are expected to be of a certain color skin and a certain religion with certain hobbies and ethics? Some adults want a certain sexual preference, damn! I don't care, I am white, I am Unitarian, I am straight but not narrow. New minority formation here - generalization is making discrimination.  Okay, rant ended. Cheers, chaps.

      I am Vampire Kanathen (no, this has no hidden meaning. This is spontaneous)  There was a collective giggle at my presentation today cocnerning John Calvin and the Puritans. I feared that the giggle resulted from my ignorance or something of that nature, but Lauren Henry and Brock ( urlLink  Bat Lord ) assured me that it resulted from my packing loads of information into a few minutes at very high speeds. My tongue is sore.  And forgive me for all the lord/vampire/supernatural shit. I am feeling like that. I think I shall make a list of what everyone would be if they were some supernatural being.

      Ben Folds is some form or a demi-god. He shapes my very existence with his piano playing, then he throws a stool at the piano and how in hell can he shift his voice so much? A demi-god, yes, like ani difranco.  Okay, I am seriously worried about my current mental state, for it seems that  every one has been able to remember dreams of late and, I swear, I have not dreamed (or remembered dreaming) for something akin to several months. In fact, I have a sparse population of dreams in general. Can someone suggest for me something like tai-chi or a related psychological breathe-through-your-elbow-Eastern-meditation-twist-your-right-foot-around-your-neck-twice activity that will spark REM activity? Because I feel like a dry well, with the capacity but not the reality.  Caramel caribou is good. And no, I am not eating a sweetened animal. It's ice cream damnit.  I should like to abuptly state that Brock posted an utterly lovely poem tonight. Don't ask why, maybe it's the insight into sexuality or the fluid sturcture or just the imagery. But it clicks.  urlLink A very lovely poem .  Have an evening, mortals.

      Suffering in another mood shift...depression...yada yada... Ready to spit some minimal pH poison at something.  I am recovering from a sickness that resricts me from any activities tonight (grumble). Planned to see all the chaps today. And I need to profusely apologize to those who read my blog for lack of postage lately, I have been engulfed in work and, frankly, can't get any poetic inspiration.  Tonight's meal was honey mustard chicken, mashed garlic potatoes, and french bread. My compliments to the cook. Wait, I was the cook! *Bwahahahahaha* Sorry.  Though I have not written of late, I did read a rather hysterical poem somewhere. I shall post it now:   EVIL! Yaaaaa Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha   Doesn't that soothe your soul? And so eloquent too!  I think I'll engage in a gay marriage as soon as possible to piss off the government as well as the multiple religious groups that say no to homosexuals because "homosexuals are all sinners" (fuck that). In fact, according to President Bush, "we are all sinners". (He says, damn the separation of church and state, and I say, damn him). Some organizations can sink sooo deep in their religious self-righteousness (*cough cough  ANAL-RETENTIVE *). Don't believe me?  urlLink Glories of a one sided mindset .  Cheers, mortals. And I am perfectly aware that this entire post is quite random. My apologies. That shows you what inhaling dijon mustard fumes can do to your brain, can it not?

Good positive happy optimistic glad enlightening buoyant etc...  School is hell as usual. My essays are dying at an exponential rate. And the apocalypse is about to come, and hell will freeze over.

      Damn. I died in pre-Calculus today. Which is absolute hell for me, because I usually do rather well in mathematics. I thought I was prepared for this test. But we can make it up, fortunately.  My AP English teacher does not hate my soul to the extent I though she did. She was very kind telling me that my writing blows you-know-what-anatomical-portion-of-the-male-body and that I ramble and that I try to sound like a pretentious British BBC wannabe. But she was kind about it. Bombastic, 'tis indeed. But the day I write a proper passable essay will be the day hell freezes over.  Speaking of which, David Mann sent this to me.   Following is an actual exam question given on a University of Washington chemistry mid term. The answer by one male student was so "profound" that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well.   Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?   Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law, (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed or some variant.) One student, however, wrote the following:   "First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.Therefore; no souls are leaving.  As for how many souls are entering Hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that most souls go to Hell.  With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added. This gives two possibilities:  1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.  2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.  So which is it?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year, "...that it will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you.", and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having that event take place, then, #2 cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and will not freeze."   The student received the only "A" given.   Cheers, mortals.

      Okay, chaps, good afternoon, how are you and all that formal stuff. I am sorry about the absence I have been observing for a time. Allow me to explain: I die slowly in the school environment. That is all that is to it.  My English teacher hates my essays; she wants to kill them, and I don't think she approves of my liberal Unitarian poetic ass. Inversely, my pre-Calculus teacher seems to really appreciate my grades; she is very conversational with me. And AP Biology is fun. Today we played with sulfuric acid and my skin is stained with potassium permanganese! Fun!  I am soon to be off to watch Mademoiselle Elise audition at MUS. Happiness, I daresay.  Here is a piece I wrote a time ago, trying to break from the stream of conscious thought style I had adopted. I have been reluctant to post it due to references, but I was convinced in any case.   Hallway  My circle of hands I’ve been noticing of late that Toes have been tripping into a little group This little group Where everyone can sing and dance And I can’t But I can poetize and my fingers Dance like their feet across the ivory I’ve fallen out, from a cloud Where my own sun set Daily Don’t get me wrong, I am not an angel And I like the rain when it falls The rain took me with it, down to The earth’s surface Splashed The sisters, like goddesses, giggle Smile and one is always holding her Mechanical hand – she has three hands – She knows my computer, healed it Lana-lana-bo-bana The other had something in her Burst Random letter, random line She couldn’t listen to the music Music – noise with a wavelength Curly hair A small smile and nails strum the Strings of a guitar She’ll make a moon disc soon Give it to the Greek boy Greek beauty Poised like a mercury Singing in that fantastic voice of his I want to be his mind It can run faster than his hand paints Paints pictures Like a photograph – click That she takes in a grassy field Run To see her after class Look in bespectacled eyes Such a lovely occurrence to say Good afternoon But I can’t, not to that other girl I say good morning She is panicking over the history Poet singer in a play I drive early to sit in her car Breathe her exhalation And I want to hold her hands Duck-yellow watercolor tips Kiss her cheek Spin her around and Tear The skin off her shoulder blades To get far enough inside –  Feel the heart? –  And watch As fledgling angel wings unfold.    Have a nice day. :-) Even though with White Station (which failed the fucking government education testing) I can never have a nice day.

This includes Elise, Alanna, Brock, Katherine D., Laylee, Jenny, Margaret, whoever else wants to join...We  are  going to have a party in the library this Sunday before all of us die in a flowery shine of sparks under the grinding heel of Wexler. I am collaborating as to time and whatnot (keep in mind that we will likely be on the sociology floor of the main/central library, with literatures and religions). This needs to happen people, lest we are smited by malicious deadlines due to the  evil-infused bloody  50 flash note cards.

      Have no idea where this came from. I know it is not poetry. Simply a conscious stream. And I played with the color.   Honeybee  Thoughts of a clean frozen river of metal cutting a path Directly into my skin are haunting my mind again Like some recurrent nightmare from hell That doesn’t want to see its one potential convert Denying its existence, and making it blow away With a sigh, with the wind like some malodor hanging In the slipstream of air as it rushes by my eyes and ears Smelling again of  blood , more  blood , the sap That doesn’t taste so sweet in my mouth, yet somehow I can lick the red drop off my finger and not recoil In the disgust that I should be exhibiting toward That vampire, that leech hiding and feeding off the Benevolent ghosts that seem to shake, shiver, quake When I wake in the middle of the night to a phantom alarm A mystical tune that was never really there to begin with And realize that it sounds like a horrid clash of memories Subconsciously reliving the very fluctuation of that voice As it slips past me in honeyed words that hide the  spark  The subtle spark of awakening, no one has yet found But here I am, trying to wake up from a netherworld That has me on the rack each time I think clearly Eating at the back of my brain, and moving inwards And then it will turn downwards, and chew through My spinal column, and into each organ that creates What I thought to be me, for a long time Some cancer that can’t be diagnosed at any hospital People hate it, and for a damn good reason Because it enervates one, and the afflicted ends up Suffering convulsions by the bathroom sink, and Frantically rubbing his arms to get the circulation To move again, to slice through the debilitating  cold  Because the thermometer is dropping too fast The antithesis of a fever, caused by realization That he is alone, he is different, because only he Will drag the smooth edge of a dagger across his skin And only he will consciously try to escape a crowd And only he crawls into a honeycomb of self-spun Delusions of depression and isolation As a number of other recluses scuttle into the honeycomb To be with him, because they too fear the norm And amongst the aliens, I am blinded in cold flashes Waiting for your voice to arrest my fingers Your lips to melt the  ice  that forms about my eyes I sink into a sleep, with the smooth skin of your hands Even if they are ethereal, and even if just the lull in dreams Resting on my shoulders, passing into my bloodstream The miniscule particles that ward off the virus infecting my Sanity.

      I have firmly made up my mind to attend the opening night of Antigone. Admittably, that was spontaneous and random, but it is rather satisfying to decide, to mandate myself to go to MUS on Thursday. I have been harassed by a few of the theater kids who are performing there. *cough cough Elise and Heather* I simply kid thee ladies, worry not. But both shall be pleased to know that I  will  be coming. To watch it. All of it. Nya.  I feel guilty. Elise has a sore throat, even as she is rehearsing tonight. Damn my curfew and homework load, for I cannot bring her a pint of ice cream to sooth her throat. Damn.  Elise lent me the Ben Folds Five (Live) CD for burning a quasi-bootleg copy that isn't really quasi-bootleg illegal because we bought it together. This makes me happy.   Listening to:  One Down (by Ben Folds - what did you expect?)  I don't know what occurred this morn, but I suddenly became drastically physically self-conscious. For example: I began to loathe my haircut for no good reason. Then I got worried about the fat distribution on my arms and neck. Then I panicked like hell. In homeroom, which is not the best of times to panic. But I restrained it.  Another reason that I am a perfect application for being fucked-up.  Before I eradicate it from my memory, I was Johannes Kepler today in pre-Calculus. That's okay if you have no bloody idea who he is. But he proposed the three theories of helicentricity building on the Copernican theory, which Newton eventually used in his principles, dealing with the orbits of planets, in which the orbit will be an ellipse (equation x-squared/a-squared + y-squared/b-squared = 1) with a and b the distance from the center of the orbital pattern to the closest and farthest point on the ellipse, and the sun as a focus  , meaning that a line drawn from the center from the focus sun to the variable planet will cover the same area in a set amount of time, denoting that the planet will gain speed as it nears the focus  , and that the sidereal period T squared will be proportional to the semimajor axis R (in astronomical units, naturally) cubed, so that an equation will be T sub-a squared / T sub-b squared = R sub-a cubed / R sub-b cubed, and the equation for a single planet will thus be reduced to T=kR to the 3/2, and in such, the period of Mercury, roughly .24 of a year (earth year, of course) squared, will be .06, set over the sidereal period of earth, squared, approximately 1.000, and this ratio will be equivalent to the semi-major axis of Mercury cubed (.39 to the third will equal .06) set, again, over the semi-major axis of earth cubed, and as this quantity will be the one astronomical unit from earth to the sun cubed, it will equal 1.000, so, thus, .06/1.000 (this is T)=.06/1000 (this is R), and .39 (semimajor axis) to the 3/2, quantity times the constant  k , which equals 1,  will come out to .24, which is the sidereal period.  Did you catch all that? Good. I demonstrated this to the calss as Kepler. Much fun.  Lemonade is good. Homework is bad. Cheers, mortals.

      There is some fucked-up connection between my brain and baby-sitting, or late night, or driving alone in the darkenss, or something to that nature. I was paid an exorbitant tip for my duties, yet I am not overjoyed at that. I enjoyed the PSAT, but that seems to have no bearing. So here I am at the computer, typing pointless words for no goddamn good reason, staring at the screen, sneezing like hell (due to changing pressure systems), and feeling thoroughly depressed. I have no idea why I am typing this at the moment. It really has no purpose. Maybe it's the layers of work I have, or some deadline that is bearing over me. But it just occurs spontaneously, even in the best of conditions. Depression is the payment for thinking, it seems.  Ah, this is all shit. I am angsty. Forgive me for this post.

      Braindead, cranial damage, skull hemorrhoid, whatever. Pre-Calculus test was actually somewhat fun, but the AP Bio test (open book) was rather difficult, and the AP English Hemingway test was hell, despite who may argue it. Three tests, in total. But they are gone, and my economics report is finished, and I am free (except for the PSAT, which will destroy my mind utterly).  My grandparents have a new rat dog. They want me to come over and name him/her/it.  At Rhodes, I wrote this really creepy piece of poetry, becuase it has a lot to do with suicide, and I found myself rather afraid as I realized I wondered about how much a slit wrist would hurt. But here's the odd piece about it:   Metal splinter  My hands are dragging me into a kitchen In some unknown home I built Overnight, while I was sleeping And my mind was working furiously Eyes burning in REM chaos, again, again, Trying to wake up twice, once from the slumber Twice, from the half-reality I have Assumed to be mine, and my fingers are itching To reach for the wall near the toaster To grasp the wood of a straightedge Knife, sword, blade, keen bright metal And wondering what it feels like when blood When life drips out on the stone floor Impatiently waiting… For the wonderful, ethereal euphoria that comes When the waves smother the breath When the snow freezes the veins When the mind begins to drift Because the body has no real purpose anymore No, my wrist has no eye of blood yet I have a sliver Gone to get a bandage (it won’t stop the cut).   As I said, somewhat unnerving. But I spoke to Alanna about these weird thoughts, and she reassured me that I was not insane, I was simply teen-age. Rather comforting.  Full weekend of hell ahead. Cheers, mortals.

      Agh. I left St. Luke's Methodist to get away from religious babble about  "Save your immortal soul! The devil wants to eat it for breakfast!"  and then, a few years later, I come back to AP English to recieve more of the "I watched a wasp dying and was reminded of God. Time to go repeat the Bible again." I am godless (almost)! I am Unitarian! And then our teacher wants to stuff Jesus down our throats? Hahahahahaha fuck no.  Okay that's all I really wanted to say but I think I'll ramble for the fun of it.  I am a fellow of two very pleasant young ladies now that I do not think I had met before. One, Miss Whitney Adsit, also attends AP Biology (but not Lab) with me. The other is miss Amber Birch, who joins me in Economics and AP English. I think they are lovely and amiable.  Two tests upon the morrow! One on a book I have not read, one on the calculus equations I have barely memorized. Fun!  Cheers, chaps. Yoga tonight.

      I get back from babysitting and realize I have a Biology essay and a Rhodes visit tomorrow and depression is already setting in. I want to see my psychiatrist. But I don't want to be a problem and demand a sooner appointment. I've been thinking, my life won't have much in it, it'll be empty, and anyone who I want to be with will find that I am insensitive and careless and forgetful.  Elise is gone to Delaware. I feel like shit.

      What the hell is with cockroaches? The only creature on earth that could survive total nuclear apocalypse. I swear, I hit that fuck thrice, and it still crawled away under the dishwasher. I think I mortally wounded it, though. I reminisce of a time with a fellow of mine. We spotted another of the damn filthy piece of you-know-what. Hit it five times with a shoe. Nike, in fact. But it still didn't die. Damn those immortal things. Had to flush it.  PSAT workshop meeting was this morn. 'twas the last one. Now we have the real thing, next week. I have the terrible fear that I shall perish.  Sibling's annoying little fiend (I...forgot...to...type the r. Oh well) is over here again. Absolutely hell in a shell.  OPEC paper now, but Monday, we're out. Thank god. But Dad's making me go to Rhodes, for a comparison college. I shall escape the state for college, but it is always good to have a back-up plan.

      Bloody hell. DOY isn't working right now. From what I hear, Anonymous came back onto the DOY comments (he/she caused trouble last time), but I shan't say anything lest the Anonymous commenter was a fellow just being somewhat, er, mocking.  Mom is currently ticked-off at the sewing-machine because - well, I know not what is wrong, but if I may translate what Mom was thinkng when she tinkered with it last night:  WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS PIECE OF SHIT DOING?" . Those were her mental words, not mine. But she is asking me to place a positive curse on the machine to make it work. Stand back, mortals. Observe as I raise my right hand, lower my left hand, stick out my left leg and turn the foot to the right, hop on the other foot, do the hokie-pokie, turn myself around (that's what it's all about), and speak "Remove thy inhibitions, craft of man! We produce thee, we create thy little bits, we may smite thee if such is to our gain!" Now it should work.  Alanna made me happy today because I made her happy. I told her I wake up to Kristin Hersh (at 100 decibels or so) in the morning. She shrieked and laughed. This was all during C lunch, so I am sure that we recieved a few glances.  Have a lovely day, chaps.

      Hey, chaps. My apologies for not posting of late. I shan't excuse myself by saying that I have been busy, buried in schoolwork, etc. I shall simply offer this explanation: I have been lazy as hell and had nothing to publish. So there. Nee!  School's fine, homework's fine, piano's not to fine but getting there, my friends are fine, why the bloody heck is this sounding like a summer camp note, I ate dinner at an English pub recently, my brother has a friend over who harasses me, I practically died this morning trying to awaken for the PSAT workshop, the cat is attacking my stocking feet to gain attention, the psychiatrist has the power to send me into a mental institute, I am avoiding about five different long-term projects right now, my heart skips for some reason, there is an army of plague-spreading skeletons from the reign of King Arthur rising from the kitchen sink (how did they get to Tennessee?), and I am arguing with the voices in my head. All in all, a fairly balanced existence. *cough cough BS*  I had a lovely afternoon today, but I feel bad, because I left someone that I should have stayed with. And I shan't state names, lest that the person of whom I speak is angered at me, or lest people begin to ask too many questions. But I wrote of it:   Iced Tea  There’s a knocking at the door that I hid beneath my flesh Barely visible, right over my heart Only to be opened for a few And then, only a crack The door’s ajar; there’s a gale outside And I close it tightly shut again, But you were able to reach in Staying my hand And your blood’s warmth Flowed from your palm to my fingers I’ve been keeping the thermostat down low Maybe I like the cold Maybe I feared the warmth for a time So my hand began to hurt with the New circulation And my heart began to pump, I’ve been having dreams lately We were in the back of a movie theater I won’t say exactly what we did But it gave me the same sort of euphoria That made my mind flutter And my breath come short When you leaned against my chest, I kissed below your left eye Forgotten something now… I didn’t take you to the stars Would have, if I didn’t fear myself Your friends are all so nice, so… … Above me… And I can’t stand in a crowd for long My lungs choke up And I fall into some cardiac arrest That happened when I was driving (I didn’t tell anyone) Come in, have some tea Before it freezes in my hand.   Orlando Bloom is an elf and a demi-god. Say nothing of him! Bwahaha. Sorry. Have a lovely evening, mortals.

      Talking to Alanna, I think I need to reconsider the whole shrink thing and perhaps get meds soon. Alanna's agreeing. She's so lovely, I can talk to her about all this. I'm not enjoying anything. I got really upset tonight (twice) and had potentially bad thoughts. So methinks I'll talk to the therapist. Fucking human mind. I'd rather be a fish.  Sorry about not posting in so long.

      Damnit! Katherine and Alanna have deleted their blogs! Snarl. I am upset. And Brock hasn't posted becuase he has almost no access to computers. And the Apocalypse (how do you spell the bloody thing?) is coming. Doom doom and more doom.  Dad says Damnit is spelled Dammit when only one word, and Damn It otherwise. Not anymore!  Alanna is so lovely. Our parents deserted us last night and ran to the Party in the Library, so she was willing to put up with me for a while so I wouldn't be lonely. I drove to her [Alanna's] house playing Stretch Princess, who is now moving up in the holy hierarchy, and we listened to Shoes. Which is a Muse in the form of sound waves. But Alanna joined me and, after my parents finally left for the Party of booze and loud music in the history section of the library, we argued about who was more indecisive over movies. So we ran to blockbuster (actually, not ran, drove rather, but who cares) and rented Frida.  Just a little thing about Frida: excellent acting, wonderful historical telling, superb color-enhancing and regulation. One problem: it's fucking creepy. Seriously, when she is painting the creepy stuff in her later life, it really frightens one. For example, the painting of her and herself attached through the neck by a vein. Or (this one really scared the shit out of me and I don't know why) the picture of her on top of a ziggeraut, with her metal brace-cage on her nude upper body, and her stone spinal column cracking, and her face full of  nails .    As I said, seriously disturbing.  Cheers.

Doom doom doom more doom and the preacher spews a bit more doom about man's walk over the pit of hell. Would you like some death with that? No! Doom, damnit! Doom doom doom!  I sincerely apologize for the frantic and evidently insane post.

      Alanna has deleted her blog. This is utter sadness, akin to the time in which Brock stopped posting. I won't say why over blogger, lest she desire that the reason be kept silent, but I know that a multitude of people are unhappy as a result of this. I mean, truly, her blog was somewhat of a column that a lot of other blogs seem to rotate about. Hers and DOY, perhaps. It's the whole breach of confidence and trust and interaction that disturbs me about the whole matter. I'm sorry, dear Alanna.  Bloody english rough drafts are due next week. I am doomed.  Oh, by the way, an interesting new link to your right. Apparently, people usually follow a behavioral sinosoidial curve (that means like a sine graph) that adheres to three human categories: emotional, physical, and intellectual. These occur in periods of 23 to 33 days. The lines are thus known as  urlLink biorhythms .  Evening, mortals.

      Good evening. I have just finished watching the Matrix Reloaded, and thus I am thoroughly depressed for no damn reason. Those movies seem to have such an odd effect on me, despite the enjoyment I perceive whilst watching them. And no one is on IM, it appears. Bloody hell. I need to talk to someone. Forgive this small paragraph. 'tis all angsty shit.  You know what? Telemarketers have secured our fax number and  they are sending us fucking faxes for products . Does that strike anyone as, say,   illegal   to the maximum it possibly can be? I mean, indeed, phones are oft used as a telemarketing tool, but the telemarketers are paying for the damn right to call me/us/whoever and preach about a product nobody wants. And that is legal. The no-call list may be argued, but it is nonetheless legal. (Damn our luck.) But faxing! We pay for the fucking paper that they print their shhhhhhhit out on! That is our paper! Is this not some subtle act of - perhaps -  THIEVERY ? (quote the American Heritage Dictionary:  thievery   n.  The act or practice of taking by stealing; larceny.) Are we stating that they are now common criminals? Because this is bullshit. Bed enough that they call, now they make us pay for their fucking sales practices that we want NO part of.  My apologies to telemarketers. It is not thee to whom I direct my anger. I am irked by your occupation. Because if there is one thing on earth that is hell-derived, 'tis the concept of telemarketing.  Cheers, mortals.

      It strikes me that it hath been quite a while since I last posted on DOY or my blog. I sincerely apologize for such. I shall post here, and if Alanna requests a post of mine, I shall comply.  Okay, where were we... Ah yes. Halloween. I was a beatnik, wearing entirely black, including this kick-ass beret I bought cheap at a hat store over on Highland. And I was carrying bongos. And my father instructed me in saying "Life is shit" in french (what was it..."la vi est merde?" or something like that). I dropped by the UU church to help clean up after their Halloween party, then I drove out to Germantown (getting lost twice) for the party over at the acting god Eric's house. Seriously, an acting god. And a very pleasant chap to boot. But I hung on the outside of all the socializing and the dancing, and spoke to Heather about everything (I very much appreciate it, Miss).  Afterwards, I spoke to Elise of my anti-social tendencies. Which, on Wendesday, I also spoke of to my psychologist. And all have agreed that I should ask Mademoiselle Elise for personal "dancing lessons", the sort of dancing that follows a route of spontenaity and involves a level of self-assurement that I utterly lack. So I should hopefully be dancing soon.  Let's see...English turned out okay, despite the  evil-infused bloody  note cards that I referred to last post. However, the initially smited idea of a library party turned out well. Though the doomed study group began with only two lovely ladies (Laylee and Alanna) and I, it swelled to an eventual 7 (entirely), including Miss Katherine Warren (temporarily), Miss Jenny (who is entirely too lovely), Lise (refer to the early posts - an angel), and eventually Master Kevin (a nice fellow). 4 of us ran over to CK's after the library closed, and worked frantically over grilled cheese sandwiches. Pleasant, I daresay.  I might be in a movie! Happiness (quantity cubed). However, I dare not reveal any details...yet.  I have written a poem that I should like to post. However, I know not if it is utterly crap. Here it goes:   Kissing the Cut  She blows a kiss to him, through a cyber code Though the binary illuminates no emotion His eyes are almost seeing the little graphic A small icon, in the shape of lips Red, as it floats onto the computer screen Animated, perhaps He doesn’t want this superficial image His hand rises, to reach through the processor To catch the real thing As maybe it will slip through the speakers Molding itself to the ridges of his fingertips He can return it to his mouth Draw a new kiss from the tongue Reach Grasp again through the reflecting pool Maybe, then, a wormhole A tunnel through time and space Fourth and third dimension knit together To touch her lips with the new sigh Held on the fingerprint Because he knows that she can understand it He knows that she understands his yearnings And his own boundaries He’s trying to rise from the swamp that became home That’s why he needs a therapist That’s why when he walks through the halls Sometimes, under the artificial Manmade, synthetic, false lights His mind suddenly stumbles Into the other side of him, off the indifference plane Where he doesn’t give a damn, to where he gives too much And it gets to him That’s the time when the call from the kitchen It’s weak right now – don’t let it become stronger Never let it become stronger Like that night, when he leaned up against The cold, smooth counter And slid a knife from the wall Touched it to his flesh, but wouldn’t pull it across Couldn’t pull it across He has a speed dial number if he ever did Someone he could talk to Someone to whom he wouldn’t be afraid to Finally cry And let loose the torrent of exasperation Torn from his throat in a passion Among these words would be “I love you” And then a few minutes before “I’m sorry For everything I’ve ever done to you and to her And to him and to them and to everyone who I might Have once, just once, done something to that might have Caused me to fall into a pit – if I am not already in one And to make my fear finally become reality –  To lose you” Because she hasn’t been in his dreams Though he promised to meet her there, every night On the same elusive plain, torn atwixt shifting universes There he can kiss her As he has done, twice before Only for the duration of the dream And only for the duration of his flamenco dance With a growing fear.    Bah. I spit upon this poem. Have a lovely evening chaps. Hasta.

      Someone talk to my blog. I am rather lonely at this moment, for I am currently in Florida and utterly isolated from everyone save my family, which might as well imply that I am isolated from everyone period. Ani is here with me though. Despite the minor drawback that she is on a CD. But she is somewhat here and she is preserving what traces of sanity I have left.  Alanna and Brock, I very much appreciate the Ani concert CD. (Actually, I love you for it. Recollect how I began wheezing at school when I unwrapped it.) Morgan, thank you so much for just getting the haircut. It is immensely happy. In addition to all that fun stuff, I now own 2 more Ani CD's, a le Tigre CD, a formal suit-like assembly, a pi tie pin (and matching shirt - 3.1415926535...),  Ghost Soldiers ,  A FRANCISCA LIA BLOCK BOOK THAT NOW OWNS MY EXISTENCE , formal silver pins, and a car CD player (yo).

      So here's the diagnosis: some anxiety syndrome that causes perfectionism and depressed tendencies. Well fuck. I have some meds that I may not take until after exams, because one of the tenporary side effects is...increased anxiety. But only for a short time. Psychiatrist dude also warned me to tell someone if I had suicide thoughts and/or increasing signs of mania(s).  Fun fun.  We talked about a whole bunch of rather interesting stuff - for example, "how many girlfriends have you had?" and "do you have   privelages   with them hint hint". And we talked a whole lot about sex, sexuality, drugs, religion, sex, alcohol, girls at school, friends, sex, medications, disorders that I may develop, sex, etc.  So yeah.  I start to take meds after exams.

      I apologize to Alanna and Heather and Becky for being a lazy fuck. I have been this lazy fuck since my last post, as you might notice, because no post follows the last post except this post, which has a significant time difference, which is why I am a lazy fuck. Understand? I don't.  Becca's gig was bloody awesome. Allow me to recollect. Several people (Alanna, Elise, Kevin, Brock, Laylee, actor-god Eric) arrived to listen to the precursor presentation, which was performed by a pleasant chap named Daniel Shank ( i think ). He wrote excellent poetry and essays. However, the greatest quantity of people arrived to listen to Becca Becca fucking-goddess-I-love-her-and-her-pickless-guitar. She played my personal fave  Morning Sickness as the second song!!!  One moment: conniption.  Okay, better now. But anyway, a whole crowd of school mates flooded in to listen to  holy divine  songs. This included Rachel, Evan, Katherine, Tarah, Lauren H., etc, as well as DOY members (e.g., Morgan). Becca is goddess. Sorry. But she also played "Telephone" (or "my telephone" I forget), which rocks everything.  Change subject: Her songs were damn excellent. All of them.  Change subject again: I am semi-free, for I turned in the hellish English paper I referred to in earlier posts. So that is over. However, señor Oh-My-Gawwwd (that's how he says it) Espinosa is giving us some shit test that no true human can actually study for. So that will be absolute hell.  Heather wants my Gollum voice on her cell phone. I am happied.  Lessee....nothing else to ramble about. Wait, I wrote something a few moments ago that I personally like. Though I may like because it is the only thing I have written in - what? - a month, perhaps.   Transparent  Glass ball Hovering between the glare of One thousand suns streaming past Some inborn light No light will last Because ever light has a shadow Thrown off carelessly And it constantly changes The light and the shadow Always, when one changes The other Changes And the photons filter through The clear sphere Bounce off my retina, invert Invert again, but I have myopia In both nuances of meaning Glass balls are light bulbs And crystal orbs That the cheap seer plugs in To see my face, warped in the glass Except that little bubble That the blowers couldn’t suck out They’re only blowers And they were creating a glass ball That had a bit of blue to it Or any color you would like To sell to some cheap seer in the Palm and tarot shops That spit artificial light from light bulbs And every time the night goes dark My vision It’s blurry Because I don’t want to use my lenses I want to see by myself It never happens like that Too many shadows to blend Made by one thousand suns Streaming past my car window And shining on the Glass.   Cheers, mortals. I cannot feel my toes, which are in my socks, which are in my boots. That says something about how cold it is.   listening to:  Ben Folds Live: Army

      Hey all.

       Proto  By the way, there seems to be something wrong with this poem. I am not really sure what. Somebody tell me.   He splashed a rusty glow Tried to paint on his face And smeared the make-up into his eyes So no one could look inside A dilated pupil (And it’s not even bright) Ripped out his own vocal cords Not wanting to hear the ugly croak Of his own voice And he tried to hide behind his textbooks Everyone knows A dilated pupil means fear.  But one plunge into the dirt reminded him That the law of gravity is made To be broken.  They –who found him Shivering in the cold abyss  Of self-deprecation – Played his voice back to him To help him To make him Remember how to laugh And it was her who held open his eyelids Melted the false skin Let the pure blue light that fell in Tiny glittering teardrops Drown out the gray.   Cheers.

      everything is dying. everything seems to be blowing up, without any order to it. i hate being on the outer edge of the circle, watching as the rift between people grows, unable to cease its existence. no, as i watch, it swells into some hideous beast, and though i still talk to people who sit on both sides of this abhorrent creature, i feel that the beast may lunge for me soon, trying to make me choose the side of the rift upon which i will live, and i will watch the other side shrink as the schism spreads. this is what needs not happen. but a guerrilla war grows, of rumor and miscommunication and disdain that settles into hatred. and one passes another, and they don't want to look into each others' eyes, for each look will send a sharp pain into their memories. and one crack has split, and branched, and spread with the frozen tears and the weathering of sighs until it threatens to crumble the statue on which it infested itself. i just have a feeling that something worse might happen. i don't know what. this is bad enough.

      'ello. Much has happened since I last posted. I can't remember most of what has happened, and that which I do remember, I shall tell.  On Saturday morning, I went bright and early (10:00 am) to the Junior Bridges meeting, where we did relatively nothing for three hours but repeat our summer experiences indoors. Afterwards, Elise and I joined each other with Whitney A., one of her friends, Laura (companion of Elise), and Nisha at the not-so-nearby McAlister's, and we all had lunch. Elise made me (she really did make me) eat a pickle, and, like I maintain, it was disgusting. I washed it down with cheesecake. Elise hit me several times for being ridiculous. She makes me so very happy.  Then I went home and killed myself with car wax.  That evening, I drove to Alanna's house, for we were planning to see Big Fish. (Brock drove his bloody nice car to her house.) Brock was there, and so was Morgan, and so was Laylee, but Laylee couldn't go to the movie (goddamn regulations). Laylee and Alanna were showering when I arrived, so I watched and listened to Alanna's computer with Brock and Morgan. Alanna asked me to call Brock wordy-durds for her, so I complied: "YOU FUCKING CUNT! WHY ARE YOU SUCH AN ASSHOLE?" I apologized to Brock.  Big Fish was sold out. We rented A Life Less Ordinary instead, and watched it at Brock's house. Morgan had me scream "Get your hands off of my woman, muthafucka!" in the car on the way there. And Wesley definately thinks I am not human. So fun.  I wrote this of late, and was encouraged to post it:   Your back is bent against the side of the mattress Head, thrown back to touch the frame And your eyes, closed As the blood rushes to your ears And feeling that peaceful euphoria on ultimate Calm, in one spot One single place in the universe Where everything is correct, for one hour One hand flung carelessly to lay on the floor The fingers slightly curled And the other in my palm, for me to hold As I peer over the mattress edge At your eyelids, and half-open lips Lightly laying one hand on your naked stomach For the sake of feeling flesh And muscle and tissue, pulsing For the sake of inhaling your exhale For the caress against skin, produces a dizzying Carbon-dioxide-inhaling sensation, like I can’t breathe And I drink my own dopamine That tells my body, you are attracted to The body that hangs over the edge of the bed Even if it isn’t for sex or marriage or legality It’s a natural love potion And I want to roll over and sigh Writing on her stomach in Sharpie:  The scents of your natural perfume And my sense of compassion for you When your back is bent And your heart inhaling The quiet lullaby of your breath Weaves the dream over my eyes And allows me to sleep more deeply.   Cheers, mortals. Have a nice evening.

      I can now play Ode to Joy on my guitar. (Whoopdie-do). I am proud of myself. I have decided to name my guitar Illona, which means "light of the sun" in Irish/Gaelic (I think). My guitar is my child. My parents don't want me to have a child (yet). This is a conflict of interests.

      I apologize for not posting in so long. Truth be told, the process has gotten rather tedious, and I am more involved in reading blogs than actually writing them. But I just had an urge to post tonight becuase I just stopped by Alanna's lovely blog and found the addresses of three sites with some of the  urlLink happiest  pictures.  urlLink Ever .  urlLink Period .  But then there are those crowds of people who preach against it because they "don't feel right about it" or "don't like gays." That is about the most pitiful statement against gay marriage and homosexuality I have ever heard. "I don't like gays." Because they are different. Well, fuck difference. Those who are paying attention to their goddamn differences don't seem to realize that homosexuals are just as human as heterosexuals, and bisexuals have no right to be left out either. We are human together. We will die of the same worldwide epidemic, and we are all born through the same method of birth, and we all live on the same essential compounds.  What about those who stand around and protest homosexuality because - get this - they don't like the idea of sex between two mala gays. Holy fuck. That is about the most superficial reason ever. The relationship is not about sex, people! It's about bonding, it's about love, it's about being drawn to another person. Any relationship is based on that and only that. The attraction based on sex and appearance is not a relationship; it is pure lust. He who assumes that two gay men are married to fuck each other only makes a mockery of the word love.  And then there are those who base their discrimination and prejudice - that is what it is, and no one can argue it, it is purely the prejudice against the African Americans in a different form - on what? A bible. A fucking bible. A book from 2,000 years ago that no one can actually prove was written by anyone above a drunk man. By all accounts, the "B"ible may have been created by a group of people who made up another way to explain things. Oh, wait, that probably is how it was created. And so we have these people who want homosexuals to die - I'm sorry, people who are different to die - becuase a moldy old book told them to. One cannot prove it was written by God. Just as one cannot prove the sanctity of the Q'uran or the Torah or the Vedic texts. They assume. And they hate because others don't assume. Or others do assume, but they don't assume the same thing. Catch my drift?  I see "Jesus" painted on the shirts of the gay protestors in the pictures. They are following the man, not the principle. Jesus preached, and they are following the religion about Jesus, not the religion of Jesus. Jesus urged unity; he urged strength, he urged faith, but most importantly, he urged unity. And unity should transcend the barriers of sexual preference. Unity does not exclude. Unity does not make exceptions. Unity includes everyone as one, and no one as separate.  Cry the beloved country, that watches as the nation falls apart as humans discriminate and commit the sin of unacceptance and bias. Who will pull it together, when people fight to pull it apart, and the people in power are slipping beneath the regulations to fight on this terrible side (*cough George Fucking W. Bush). Amendment proposal: marriage is the holy joining of a man and a woman. Holy my ass. While Britney Spears is married in the Little White Chapel, activists who pound their fists on reality (hoping it will break) tell us that two people who can actually love are not fit for marriage. Unity. Everyone says it is a dream; it becomes more of one daily.  What are we? One color? One race? One sex? One religion? And as we protest difference, the sands of time and the smoke of war and the ink of prejudice rain upon our heads and gradually make us one color, one race, one nationality, one sex, one religion, one species. One being. One corpse. I am of one place: Earth; of one color: blood; of one race: human; of one sex: we; of one religion: reality; of one species:  Homo sapiens . Of one sexual orientation: polysexual.  Of one being: we who exist on the same planet.

       Intersection  1 My sister looks nothing like me Thinks nothing like me yet Somehow we can lean against each other Find a structural support in each others’ shoulders Naturally Sometimes we drift apart and sometimes we float back together in a frenzy of realizing How far had we just gotten To where I couldn’t see you and you couldn’t see me? Each blow I inflict upon her flows through blood And ends up hitting me in return quote, No Man Is An Island We, she and I Positive and negative Outgoing and introspective just fit sometimes jigsaw fashion.  2 I know that a soul never came I know this because her tummy (that is what we called it back then) would speak a faint, insistent pulse whenever I put my ear to her navel and she would say to me, “can’t you hear the kicking?” I would be excited, and whisper, for fear of waking it up while it still slept “it’s kicking, mommy” but one day the kick ebbed and they held me and told me that it never really came I would never know whether I could train him or sing to her They told me it was a miscarriage mommy, what’s that mean?  3 it always happens around this time just like I expect it to a guest that I never want to come by but that I have no right to scream &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhy &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFuck have you come back and made me want to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprun away &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand hide my face &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand never look up again or do something so no one will have to suffer me thinking that no one wants to see the smile on my face ever again which I have only stolen back recently and then the guest pulls out &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa list of what I have done wrong, of course so why don’t I just end it now here		on the kitchen floor no one will care just six &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspswift &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspslices here and there let all of it, all of it out but I made a promise not to.  4 Don’t talk to me I don’t want to see you right now or her, or him, or anybody I just want to curl into a ball and sleep without knowing:  5 i have a secret i have a secret that i know and no one else knows it it’s my secret, and i don’t have to tell it it’s a precious feeling, having a secret a little blue ball between my fingers and no one can know it because it’s all mine i breathed on it today it rose up and embraced me for i found out that i could cry and the secret can only be whispered when no one is watching so i won’t say my secret unless i say it to Her i would give my secret to Her, so she would know it and then we would have a pair of secrets the two of us hummingbirds that travel in pairs humming because they know something and they know that no one else knows blue hummingbird i hold Her in my palms.   Sorry I am not blogging frequently anymore.

      The prospect of aging past eighteen in my current body and mind has become even more unfavorable in the past week. Rotary leadership convention ended; I made many friends and watched as they all left for their respective places in existence. College fair passed, reminding me of the inevitable crawl of minutes toward the end of this life and the beginning of another. Friends fade in and out of my peripheral vision, my hormones explode and fade and explode again, and I am currently choking on my own escophagus.  I was at the Leadership conference in Olive Branch over the weekend, enjoying myself thoroughly. I actually danced, which made me swell with exorbitant pride. And I met this wonderful strawberry blonde at the conference who I slow danced with and seriously considered dating. However, cue the problems: she lived an hour away, and even though she said she would have dated and considered me perfect boyfriend material, she was conservative, and it would not have worked out. Next morning, everyone leaves, and I am seated in a Rotary van headed back to Memphics, thinking of everyone who I probably wouldn't see again, despite efforts to do otherwise (for example, Jessica, the strawberry blonde).  I am now realizing I get jealous too fucking easily. I hate myself for it. Even worse, I sometimes hate other people for it.  At the college fair, my mother took the approach of, simply put, "Go to this College Fair today or you  will  end up at University of Memphis or UT Knoxville," which pissed me off highly and set me into a thoroughly upset mood. This was about five minutes after I returned from the Convention, by the way.  My dreams are convoluted, and many of the ideas that seep into these surrealistic dreams are either actions I never want to take or actions that I would love to take but will never happen. So my brain is teasing me again. And I am fatigued often. My parents have an inclination to believe such may have been in part from the 20 mm of meds. I cut it down to 15 mm. Now I am getting depressed.  I really need to get work. I also really need to get some type of close relationship. It would probably help to the extreme, both of these. I am currently trying.  I have no idea why I am stating all this online. God damnit.

      Last night/This morning was extremely weird for a reason I do not entirely comprehend. I joined Alanna and Brock and Katherine and Alice for fun stuff last night for no good reason. On the way out to get chicken (fried), Katherine's tire popped, so we all pulled over and sharpened our life skills throwing ourselves bodily at the lug nut wrench (Earnest has power, by the way, with the lug nut wrench). We then decided to swing by the smart mart near alanna's house for roman noodles, pringles, hot fries, and one (1) honey bun. That was enjoyable, save the fact that we are currently in allergy season, and last night I could not go for one minute without sneezing out half of my brain.  I went home at 8:00 and popped one, count it, only one Benadryl shit tablet to stop my allergies. It just so happens that Benadryl (fuck spelling) hates my existence. I passed out at 10:00 pm (Saturday night) and awoke at 2:00 am (Sunday morning); upon realizing this, I returned to bed at 2:45 am, and proceeded to have some seriously fucked-up dreams. In the first, I was among a group at my school that decided to kill everyone. It was horrible. I remember shooting people and they would twist and fall down. Then we (the group) hid in a classroom waiting for the police and I was afraid of being shot to death. The second dream was connected to this one. Everything in the first dream had been a dream (in the dream), but half of the school had the dream, and another half didn't. The half that had the dream (dreamt) was afraid of me. I was so upset that I kept trying to call my mom to pick me up, but the phone was not working.  In a third dream, I was in the same school, and the whole school was brainwashed. Next to the second floor windows (this was not WSHS), we (the school) were constructing the nests for species that were going to horribly wipe out the entire earth. The nests involved the egglings, nest material, parmesan cheese and a raw egg mixture. (wtf.) Then the whole school ran away and I was wearing an armed hovering pack. Some eggs began to hatch; I blasted them with some type of fire (I distinctly remember doing this). Three escaped outside. When I followed them, I saw they were attacking Meg Kerr (also in an armed hover pack) with lasers. I tried to help her fight them, but I couldn't.  If any of these seem funny, they weren't. They were terrifying. I should laugh at them.  On a lighter note...  I have been thinking about what all my fellows would be like when drunk. Elise would be in a kind of acting mood, trying to say that she only took "a sip" of a drink, and she would also be laughing and falling all over the place. Alanna would be giggling and laughing and singing kristin hersh and le tigre. Katherine would be acting like a queen; she would laugh and be motherly somewhat to everyone else. Brock would be sprawled half the time, and the other half he would be dancing around with alanna and singing in shrill tones. Alice would dance around constantly laughing, and somewhat stumble every once in a while. Lauren D. and LA would probably watch half the time. The other half, Lauren D. would tackle people, and LA would be walking among everyone. It would be fun and rebellious.  Cheers.

      No idea where this came from...   Poe doll dances around every night at precisely eleven fifty-seven pm its eyes begin to glow with the digital burn and I watch it rising out of the floor with a purple mist creating its tattered robe barely smiling through its stitched mouth it dances two feet off the floor spinning feverishly in a wide oval and the tatters fly out in a ring around it it sings with a faint wail a faint wail the cat's cry in a human throat of a little serene and faintly ominous thing? and the spark on its back begins to spread leaping to its tatters and its stick hands held out like a scarecrow and then lights up the head in a blue yellow flame its eyes are burning brighter than its personal inferno the Poe doll begins to wobble its tatters are fluttering unevenly and its wail dies away the Poe doll sinks back into the floor at twelve eight am precisely the grisly cadaver of a dream I sewed its lips together and lit it on fire.   Does someone have any insight into random thought who could explain this?

      I went around today for a lively session of snatching applications for summer jobs, etc. I dropped by (in order) Atlanta Bread Co., Mantia's, Folk's Folly, McAlister's, Wild Oats, Perkins, Davis-Kidd cafe, and TCBY. Becca was working at Mantia's, and oh my god she is always always adorable. But most places said they weren't hiring currenty; however, they would probably hire around summer. So, fun. Cheers.

      Evening, all. Sincerest apologies for not posting in something akin to a decade. I have been distracted by school and sleep deprivation.  Let's see, where to begin. Much has happened since the last post. I lost all recreational driving privelages by not stopping completely at a stop sign about one hundred feet away from my house. Which, truthfully, sucks much. I am hardly able to go anywhere now, for I am (usually) dependent upon myself for transportation. I have slacked off in school, I am dying with fatigue, I am having less than self-preserving thoughts. Blah. School is coming to a close soon, thank god.  I am really surprised that my moodiness has not been improved by the rain recently. I usually feel splendid in rain.  Mom and Dad are attacking me for not having a job and for not being organized, which is thoroughly making me feel far worse than I think they realize. I just feel that their view of me has gone down recently, because I made *gasp* two B's on my report card and had a little encounter with the teen driving squad (police). I feel they are taking something out on me. Which is probably not true, but it sure as hell seems like it.  I really think that I am just having trouble with trust and self-image lately. I've been finding out things about friends that I wish they had told me, for example. And I can't be too sure what my fellows think about me sometimes. This, too, is probably nothing at all, and I am probably overreacting as I always do. God. I hate my neurons. I've been having this insane idea of letting all the bad blood seep out of my wrists. Or taking enough pills to make it better.  Blegh. Forgive me for being a lunatic. I am going to drink a pinapple Fanta soda. Like right now. And play Rachmoninaff whilst drinking this golden soda. Tropical Rachy.

      Sunburns are not pleasant. The amount of sun I recieved today while idiotically working shirtless on the lawn was enough to make the skin on my shoulders bubble. No, fucking literally. So, yeah. Wear sunscreen. I'll be a walking pile of skin cancer in a little while. I am also currently glowing with the approximate hue of a lobster.  I've been talking with lovely Miles lately. I can't understand why people can be so ignorant and hypocritical. See, Miles and her fellow Ian should like to hang out more, but Ian's possessed mother, a turn-face Christian, is so goddamn closed minded. I mean, I am friends with plenty of Christians, but there are always extremes. This woman pledges openness, yet, in the same breath, slanders anyone who does not give their entire life and half of their firstborn to Jesus H. Christ. So now Ian is grounded, holed up in some travesty of a shelter whilst his mother pounds the goddamn bible into his head. Fucking what. Just because they know each other, Ian's mother goes insane. Just because they know each other, that bitch refuses to understand that his whole life of pain and struggle is becuase her glorified one sided mindset is not compatible with what his mind tells him. He is not a fucking disciple. Ian is a human, and he has the right to choose her own path.  I apologize. I need to go calm down. We have an idea for rebellion.

      I hath returned from my travels to the far away land of colleges. And allow me to say, the land is so fucking confusing that I will run to my room and curl into a fetal position. I visited furman, clemson, and emory. The first two are extremely pleasant. The last one is questionable: Atlanta lives on Emory's goddamn campus. So that location is questionable. But anyway. We spent a lot of time driving with our butts stuck to leather seats.  I am back though, and the second I entered my house I got dizzy. The humidity of Memphis, it seems, is not exaclty salubrious to my physical state. Amber agrees. Lovely thing, her. I am going to steal her away from hr parents and hide her in my room so she won't have to leave.  I don't think the medicine is working anymore. It has been doing nothing for the past week, so I shall be discussing with Dr. Price some variation of the stuff. It seems to be causing fatigue in addition to not working. Wonderful. Might as well overdose on advil for a similar effect.  I wrote a surprising lot on the trip. Two of the items I posted on DOY. The piece here I wrote Sunday morning, before we left, and I asked the manager to give it to the actual Robert. I think it made him happy. I dunno, though, as we left immediately after:   Robert, out waiter, has the soft eyes and the melted smile of a man who understands his relationship with people. He works when he can, but seems to value talking to someone. When speaking, his eyes wander, and his voice is beautiful: sad, somehow, and somewhat raspy.  Robert, it seems, is still a kid; he knows this, and how it affects his customers. His gentle chocolate skin always shifts into a smile when he talks about driving to Rome daily for his nightly work, after his shift here ends. And though he is just one picture, Robert, has become the fragile part of a web in this intimate community. He has painted the road to the paradoxical power plant in the fields, and the quiet wood and iron bridge, and the tiny shop of pizza and peanuts.  I wish he would write about who he is. Robert's story would be a series of pictures.   Heather, why the hell are you in Oklahoma? Alanna and Katherine and Brock and Miles and Amber, we need to do fun stuff before summer is over and we are dying in the senior year that precedes college. (Let the grades I just recieved from the school not bode for next year).

      I went to the soup kitchen today with miles. It actually proved to be most fun; the people there were nice and funny, and I saw several faces that I recognized but did not realize were from white station. Miles was, as always, lovely and fun and I enjoyed being around her. I appreciate that she asked me to come.  Guess who I also saw? Lela! Lela lyla lily, daughter of my father's friend. She is so precious and adorable and grown up now! Haven't seen her in an age, which is actually several years. God. I want to jump on her and hug her and steal her away with miles. That's what I'll do. And we'll all run away to Paris.

      Evening. As I stated last post, I have not had an extreme amount of time to post in the past week or so. At the moment, I have a few seconds of independent thought to spare, so I shall try to bring this charade of a blog up to date.  Exams have been happening of late. Quite evil, assuredly. Both English and Biology are null and void, as the exams for these have been taken care of in the Advanced Placement nonsense. We have been watching movies in Biology for a while now. Holla. Government exam is looming for tomorrow. That fuck is going to be deadly.  There really isn't that much to tell. Damn. I need more excitement...  I am currently grasping for jobs that don't grasp for me. This is upsetting. Davis-Kidd told me they would call this week, and they haven't. Damnit. I need money. Today my last check bounced. And then the bank charged three times the fucking amount of over-charging. Blah, System. So I need money.  I shall be going out with Heather Saturday night, to celebrate school's end as well as Heather's birthday. And I shall have cd's for her, filled with nonsensical tunes of power and oddity. We shall see Shrek.  Must be going. Grandparents have just arrived. Cheers.

      Evening, all.  No time to say much. I really must be fleeing away to my bed. However, two things: Heather is in DOY! I love that girl. We are poet junkies now.  Second, a bittersweet passage made quickly.  Moonshine  Let's run away tonight, all day at school Over the telephone Quiet, so that our parents won't hear us Let's run away tonight Before you move all the way across my world And I can't fall into the classroom Tripping over my own feet While looking at your eyes Tap on my window twice, take my breath I can run to the kitchen Take the small pack of oreos (It lies on the counter) And the little red flashlight in the cabinet There you are, creeping up behind me I turn and kiss you on your lips Like a breeze And take your smooth hand in mine Creep back through the open window The stars are frozen gemstones tonight Let's run away Before I find you running to the moon.   Night.

      I daresay the AP Biology exam is over. Hell yes. I am not free of evil AP exams. However, it does appear that Mrs. Wexler deems it appropriate to continue working us like Saint Bernards. Ugh. Devilish essays about personal material. Blegh.  I talked to Whitney Adsit today before/after the bio exam. Apparently her horse, Ferris, will be out of commission for some time, as it tore a hunk of ligament from the back of its leg. I promised Whitney I would visit Ferris sometime this year; I plan to stick to that promise, even if that demands visiting her the day I receive my driving privelages back. I want to see Miss Adsit again. She is so lovely.  Two weeks 'til school closes up, yo. I'm feeling senioritis already. Let me out of this prison, I want to start my internship.

      Hey, all. Jesus Christ I am the worst person in blog maintenance history.  I just finished watching  Save the Last Dance , which is, seriously, now one of the (my) best movies of all time. A white girl goes to New York and learns dancing from a black guy. Whilst doing so, they fall in love. Damn wonderful, and a superb anti-racism movie. And every scrap of dancing in that movie is beautiful. I should like to state, Sean Patrick Thomas is one of the coolest (is that cool to say anymore? cool?) guys (black or white) that I have seen, and Julia Stiles is so graceful and beautiful and I think I might worship her and ask her for divine dancing ability. God knows I need it. Well, maybe God doesn't know, but I know I need it. Anyone who has seen me dance knows. (Jessica, of the Rotary Council, knows. Sigh...passed opportunities).  Someone teach me to dance.  AP English exam from hell passed Monday, which is, incidentally, a very good thing. I'm aiming for a three. Thus, if I recieve higher, I shall be pleasantly surprised. Let's see what's next - Biology exam. On Monday. Damn. I shall be studying Sunday for that bloody thing. Especially all the "design an experiment" shit. But the rest, I can handle fairly well.  I am pretty sure that my fatigue is bettering (is that a word?). It may be from lessening the medicine from 20 to 15 mm. Or it may be from eating protein bars. Either way, I am staying awake in Biology somewhat better. Senioritis is beginning to sap my strength. Goddamnitall. I want summer.  This actually sounds rather odd, but I am beginning to want to work this summer. And not necessarily for money, just as somewhat of a daily purpose. I don't want an easy job. I strangely want to work as a waiter, or something in that category. I mean, though I want money, I don't want it to be so easy to access that it becomes monotonous. And I don't want to mow yards. Not my class of work, personally, despite the loads of cash that might flow in. Davis-Kidd or Folks Folly sounds extremely appealing.  This is actually a rather long post compared to recent blogging.  We have some stuff coming on up in English that will be time consuming. But beyond that, the weeks until school tapers off appear somewhat clean. Let's just pass the damn exams and go to sleep. I'm ready to start working as an intern geneticist.  Cheers, mortals. Let the words of wrong become the gestures of right. (What the hell did that mean?)

      Happy birthday to me. Nya. Seventeen, finally. I'll be going out on the eighth of july to get the immediate unrestricted license (wanted to today, but it has to be one whole damn year). However, I did get to go give blood (one pint) this morning. I am now a donor, so I am happy. My blood type is likely to be O pos or O neg, being that both Mom and Dad are O positives.  I got a hat this morning that I have been looking at for a while now. I also recieved the  Biological Exuberance  book. I shall be reading these instead of summer reading, and thus, Mrs. AP lady will destroy me.   listening to:  I'm a Believer by Smash Mouth (on my new Shrek CD)  Holla.

       Curious thoughts:  Birds of a feather flock together and crap on your car.  If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.   Don't assume malice for what stupidity can explain.   A penny saved is a government oversight.   The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the right time, but also to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.   The older you get, the tougher it is to lose weight, because by then your body and your fat have gotten to be really good friends.

      'ello. Recently returned from Jackson MS where I was enjoying a leisurely, sleepy weekend. Father's Day was fairly uneventful. I remember nothing of the trip back to Memphis for I was asleep for the entire thing, or hovering in that nether region between total unconsciousness and semi-awakeness.  The second purpose of this litle trip to Jackson was my birthday celebration with my grandparents. Mi abuelita made me a vanilla bean cake spread with reaspberry/white chocolate icing. Horrible for one's health, I'm sure, but utterly delicious. I also recieved a book explaining the biological impact of nurture on the 30,000 gene sequences in the human body, as well as a Pixies CD (Trompe Le Monde). Holla. I can see why Alanna dies over Frank Black.  What else is occurring? I am to tutor early in the morn and recieve moneys, so that shall be salubrious. And I recieved SAT II's scores today. Math II was a 770 out of 800, which is somewhat depressing since that places me in the 83rd percentile. Seriously, everyone passes the Math II. Also, I recieved a 790 in Molecular Biology (that'll look positive on the transcript) and an 800 in Writing (who would have believed that?).  Gone. Cheers.

      Oy. New layout, as you can see. This was initially Alanna's blog template. I took to it, though it does seem to smack of gothic-ness. Anyway, here 'tis. New layout, new colors, old material. Archives are evidently placed to your right, as well as links. Colored alternatives can be located at the lower pole of this blog. Profile also to your right. Keep you arms, legs, and any other appendages inside the computer, and shut that fucking cell phone off.  Many people are gone for a little while. Elise has departed for Japan. Both Amber and Elizabeth are gone, but will be back by Friday, when we shall have a fun-filled day. I hope.  Birthday in twelve days.  I tutored this morning in Algebra, and recieved forty dollars for it. My student said he had a far more thorough understanding with my assistance. I need that money. I have yet to find an occupation. Unemployment sucks.  Redid my entire room. A far more comfortable location now. Cheers.

      Amber is absolutely one of the most enjoyable people on earth, in my personal opinion. She is so lovely and effusive and fun. Sadly, her parents are deeply suspicious of anyone beyond set perameters (namely, male and sixteen years), so I have practically no permission to go and steal her away. Apparently, as a 16-year male, I shall kidnap, rape, brutally murder, and quarter her and bury the spare parts beneath an apple tree. That is what they feel.  Thus, I shall be visiting Amber at work tomorrow, methinks. And then she can steal me away if she wishes, because it would be a most egregious error to introduce myself to her parents (until  that  point in our plans is realized. Bwahaha).  Today was made up of absolutely nothing. I destroyed my bunk bed and kept the futon as my new sleeping mattress. Perhaps I will be repainting it in earth tones. I also reorganized a whole lot of my room, which was utterly pointless and, thusly, without point. If that makes any sense.  Amber, don't leave so soon. We shall be keeping contact until you are 18 and free once again. Then we can go to a college together and be rebellious and never return home.  Cheers.

      Hey peoples. This morning were the lovely SAT II's. Thank god they are over for the summer. I don't want school work for at least another two weeks. Alanna was there this morning taking the SAT I, so I got to see her and hang out for about ten minutes and sing about ice cream men. And a surprising number of familiar faces were there also: besides lovely lanna, I saw laylee, brock, elise, LA, lauren, dan ying, etc. Fun faces, I say. I needed that boost.  New meds probably start tomorrow morning. The fucking pills are huge, so let's hope they are worth it. Alanna, Amber, Heather, I may be out for a week or so, because the stuff causes, apparently, spontaneous dizziness and drowsiness. Not that I am already free of dizziness already. Blegh. And I apologize if I am hostile to anyone in the next week; the meds can cause hostility to an extent for a little while.  Not hungry right now, while everyone is eating my recipe of shrimp/chicken pasta. Odd. I am usually ravenous. I dunno. I want to see someone right now. Like Alanna. Let's do something Alanna.  Cheers.

      Amber! Why must you flee to Jackson? I shall be visiting you, mark my words. As I have said, thy departure slices part of my throat and heart from me.  This morning I arose bright and early to get to my new pseudo-occupation at the Baptist Cancer Institute. It was actually quite fun: the morning opened up with a breast cancer session, followed by several hours of reading up on breast and colorectal cancer, followed at noon by a general tumor council, specifically targeting the growth of blood vessels to colon tumors. They provided lunch with the noon session. All in all, rather enjoyable. Dr. Neese and Dr. Fowler are wonderful people to work with.  I have spoken to the owner of the Butcher Shop, who, incidentally, is a very good friend from our old neighborhood. He assured me that he could find some openings in several restaurants, maybe even in the Butcher SHop. A wonderful chap, Mr. Hughes.  SAT II's saturday. Gag me with a butcher knife.  I am overjoyed to realize I have been dreaming of late. At least, I can remember my dreams to an extent. In any case, that makes me happy. I remember that one last night included Elise, and she was driving her car. It was a happy dream, I remember that. Also, I had one today whilst I was sleeping after finishing the noon conference at Baptist. I remember I was with some female that I cannot remember at some rock concert thing, and it was exhilerating and strangely romantic and I enjoyed it immensely.  I have recently broken down and purchased  Echo  by Miss Divine Lia Block. Have a lovely evening.

      What in hell is with the Atkin's diet? I know that it is lauded as one of the most amazing innovations of out pitiful social existence. It seems that the main idea behind it is eating whatever you want - chicken, steaks, a bowl of animal fat - as long as you avoid the carbohydrates. Thus, you could stop by McDonald's for several weeks in a row and order one hamburger, no bun, and lose twenty pounds of weight.  However, though I am but a high school biology student, I think that there might be something wrong with this concept.  Namely, the whole avoidance of carbohydrates. (By the way, carbohydrates translates as sugars and starch. This comes into play later.) I do think that in every, mind you, every metabolism study in bio class, the very basis of cellular respiration (human digestion and energy usage) is a carbohydrate. Specifically, a little six-carbon sugar named glucose. This molecule is responsible for unleashing most of the energy your body needs. I do not think that a full blown bio lesson is necessary right now, but I do think that some priorities need to be straightened.  Where are we going to get not eating carbs, aka, one of the most important molecules in your body? Sure, you begin to look like a twig perhaps, but you also have a fucking off-balance metabolism. Let us state a biological fact: carbs are necessary for human survival. Period.  If one is so anxious about eating carbohydrates, let him/her choose unrefined sugars at least. Of course you aren't wonderfully healthy on a diet of pasta; it is way too refined. Fruit sugars (carbohydrates, mind you) are unrefined. That is why they are so healthy. If you want top avoid fruits too, with their vitamins and whatnot, be my guest. It has carbs.  Sorry about that. Eating vanllina ice cream with low-fat high-sugar hot fudge, thank you.

      The epitome of the homosexual vs heterosexual battle:   Two friends sit in a coffee shop. One is lesbian. The other is straight.  Lesbian: I think that vibrators will replace men's genitalia one day. Friend: That is a phallacy! *Friend hits Lesbian with a large dildo.*  I know that made no sense at all, but I was very pleased with it.  You should all proceed to this site henceforth:  urlLink The Ill Will Press . Gotta love the squirrels. Especially that schizo one with the glasses. (Watch the Kevorkian scarf.)  What one would say if the blog were not to public... Cheers.

      Four day countdown to the superstorm 2003 date, my companion memphians. If fate and omens play any part in this, we shall observe a second land-blown hurricane descend about our mortal ears. A tornado will peel the bark off trees and panes from windows. After such, hail shall rain with such intensity as to render roofs and walls useless, and straightline winds will sweep away the debris, the trees, and everything not duct taped down. Lightning shall light the streets with unnatural fire. And then everyone shall crawl out, those who are still alive.  If fate and omens have nothing to do with it, July 22 will pass just as quietly as it would have a year ago had the storm not occurred. Wait. That seems a bit pointless to say. Oh well.  Got AP scores back today. I took biology (and lab) as well as english language and composition. On both I recieved ........................... *drum roll proceeds* ..................... a five out of five. Holla out. I will be bringing this holy sheet of grades to Mrs. Wexler's evil chamber of doom and wave it in her direction, allowing the scent of success to waft into her face. Let her see that her english essays hath not smited my spirit! We shall triumph. (Eventually).  Manda over in Alabama is one of the coolest people I know at the present time. I will have to see her and Amber very very soon in a bittersweet reunion of our time in Memphis. And then we will flee to college and see one another every weekend.  Cheers, my fellows.

      First day of my new volunteering opportunity. I have chosen, to escape chores as well as to feel accomplished, to use my time at the Trezevant Manor Retirement Community (where, incidentally, my father is one of the top directors. But that has nothing to do with this). The good thing about Trezevant is that all the residents love anyone young and take instantly to them (many times). The staff is actually really happy with some new faces too. The bad thing is that you can't always understand what the residents are saying.  Tanya and Siberia, two of the staff members, are cool and absolutely hysterical. I think they appreciate my help. Distracting the residents and whatnot. We actually went to Cracker Barrel today and had much fun at our own table.  I woke up Miles from her nap after volunteering. I am such an ass. Well, I'll make it up to her. With ice cream. Ice cream always makes everything better.  Not much else is happening. Amber still needs to come back to Memphis. Her cousin Amanda should come too. We will flee this little circle of inferno to somewhere grander, like Nashville. Hot tub party in the Ritz, ladies and gentlemen.

       Alanna is home , so you should bring her tribute and lay it at her feet. She sings like a muse, I swear to god. Even though she denies it vehemently. Gah. Future music career for that girl, methinks. I can see it happening. She'll be on the cd's front cover.  Swinging is flying. Alanna and Brock and I are elementary students with wings forever. Alanna and I were married in midair.  If only I had a brain.

      Uma Thurman is soo pretty. Gattaca, Kill Bill, and Paycheck. Three movies and in all three Uma is so lovely and pretty. I think that she has hips similar to Laylee. But she has replaced Natalie Portman as my favorite actress. The favorite actor still goes either to Johnny Depp or Orlando Bloom.  Currently talking to Manda, Amber's cousin. I think Manda is cute and lovely and sweet. By the way, Amber moved across the fucking state last night. This is bullshit. We're on the edge of her goddamn senior year. Ladies, we're having a senior party in Nashville when we turn 18. At a hotel. In the hot tub. Mocking our parents.  About to watch  once upon a time in mexico . Depp depp depp depp...  Gone folks.

      Radio is one of those movies that always makes me want to crawl into the fetal position while watching it. It is very good and emotional and extremely well done. One should watch it for the purpose of having that experience. PPV or Blockbuster. Choose one.  There is a lady who works at the pharmacy who is well past my age. She has pale skin and black curly hair and this wonderful smile that she gives to everyone; quite attractive. I think I have a crush on her. This, however, is a bad thing, for, as I stated, she is in her mid-thirties, whereas I am but an adolescent. Damn age barrier.  Searching for a companion...and still unsuccessful. I am so ready for college to steal me away right now. Bloody senior year of high school. I am ready to escape this drab city for other locales. And other possibilities for lifestyles.  Zoe is one of the most precious people I know. Wonderful and adorable.  The internship today was lethargic. All morning I was half asleep, whilst sorting files of patients and trying to find if this woman recieved genetic counseling or totally ignored the cancer institute's calls. However, Dr. Fowler (director of Dept. of Genetics at Baptist and my employer) used my information on his rare disease presentation. A special rush of energy for seeing that. Dr. Neese (Dr. Fowler's co-worker person) and I made fun of Dr. Fowler while he was presenting. In front of the research nurses and oncologists. Sorry about that, Dr.  I need sleep. Check-up tomorrow. First time in about six years. Cheers and dream quiet dreams.
