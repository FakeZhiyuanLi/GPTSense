       MANAGING ACROSS CULTURES Susan C. Seider and Jean-Louis Barsoux (Prentice Hll, FINANCIAL TIMES)  PART ONE The meaning of culture  Managers who readily accept that the cuisine, the literature, the musid and the art of toher countries run parallel to one another, must also learn to accept that the art of management differs in other countries. André Laurent, Professor INSEAD  1.  Despite evidence of converging behavior among countries, we challenge the myth of the ´global village´or ´melting pot´.  We also challenge the notion that ´bysiness is business´, that management, like schience and engineering, is immune to the influence of culture, or cultrure-free. Although somewhat difficult to detect, culture can be a powerful force that can undermine or propel business success.  Its presence needs to be brought to the surface and its consequences anticipated.  We need to develop awareness of how our own cultre influences the way we behave and how others percieve and respond to that behavior.  This means acknowledging stereotypes, but then getitng beyond them.  We have to surface cultural differences and make them open to duscussion in oder to avoid the rusks of getting caught in the undertow. 2.  A framework that can be used as a guide to discovering this meaning.  This framework highlights key cultural dimensions that are most commonly used and referred to in the manegement literature.  Knowing these dimensions enables us to look for the relevant cues that can help to direct our behavior, to anticipate the preferences or reactions of others, and to question the underlying reasons for the differences we enscounter.  This framework thus provides a map and a method of xploring culture differences – both within and between countries – guiding us through different approaches:  observation, questioning, and interpretation.

      We went bouldering at Malgrat again...  It was bad.  I was doing something rather difficult and was busy climbing out at the top, when a piece of rock broke in my right hand.  I held on with my left and came down in 3 very fast movements (it took me 5 to get up)!

        I want to form some sort of study-online group.   I´m studying spanish at the moment and I find it very difficult. Maybe it would be more fun if we can get some people together and share what we learn. I really think it would make remembering and studying soooooooo much easier!   Come-on!
