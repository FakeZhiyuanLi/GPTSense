      Why must he still search for me when im no one to him? Why must he calls me late at night to share every single moments with me? Who am i to him?   i love him. i do. i know his attitude of a playboy. i do. and still. my heart never change. one day, if i get him. i would change him to someone else. a different person who know how to treat certain peo-ple properly. im still confused how he can just two-timed girls... for me, two timing a girl is the most difficult pains of all the love problems.  he two timed two girls, N and F. this is wht i really heard from a few peeps out there. N and F are bestfriends. and as well, both of them are my ex bestfriends. he stead with N a week after he sound me to a steady relationship but i rejected cause it seems that im not well prepared for another relationshp. so, N forced him to two timed me too, as i really love him. it was lucky me, that my attitude that time shucks. so, he didnt sound me. it came to the part F when its his ex steady. she realized her mistakes to him and apologized and said she wanna restart it all over. N came and forced him to patch with F. n he didnt. but after thinking twice. he did.. N noe he was two timmng her. but F didnt know. in this mean time, he told me tht he loves me. and i believed. so, one day, F got to found out and told me evry thng.she told me ths and thts.so. i cried and decided nt to tlk to him no more.. but he gav his explaination to me. and told me, yesh, he didnt love me but he alos didnt hate me. whts left to be said? he still wanna us bcum friends but i decided not.. now, F n N both knew tht they share the same boyfriends. wonder how they did it. i asked my fren y? she said..it was for the sake of their friendship. tell me. which girl just wanna share the same guy? isnt its a flaw of love? this happens 3 months ago. now, i treated him just like a bestfriend. a close one. and he told me 2 weeks ago tht he loves me. i knew tht he were lying huhs. think so. and now..i knew his feelngs all were gone for me.. see. his feelngs for a particular girl is only abit...and kept changng. he thinks girls heart are like a cycle...im giving up...
