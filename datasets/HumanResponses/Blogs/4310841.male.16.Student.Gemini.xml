          I have just returned from Rowe camp, a cool little place in MA where cool people get together to hang out and do cool stuff. I guess I should be more specific, but doing that would take more time than I have right now. Perhaps at a later date I will chronicle my experiences there.  Anyway, just coming back I am still feeling the rush of emotional growth it gave me and the sadness of having to part will all of those amazing, wonderful, talented, and individual people there. I feel luck that I was able to go, so check back for updates.  Update:  On my first day at Rowe, I was unsure about what was going to happen. I was pretty sure that it was going to be fun, because I had attended a different camp during my childhood, but my experiences at sleep-away camps have not always been pleasant ones. I arrived early, and so I waited around for around 20 minutes. I went up to the infirmary to check in with the nurse while I was waiting, just to be sure she knew what was going on (I have diabetes) and check that she had received all of my stuff. I went back to the farmhouse to finish getting registered.(The farmhouse is like the nerve center of Rowe Camp. Itâ€™s where the computers are, and where the head honchos are all day.) and made my way towards my cabin. At the crossroads, I met Dave, the spirit of our cabin. Within a minute of meeting him, I knew that he was awesome and I was gonna love being in a cabin with him. I was kind of nervous, but hey, it was my first time at a new camp with a bunch of people who had mostly known or met each other before. I went to the orientation at the rec hall. I was early, so I took that as an opportunity to learn of the wonders of the game called "BUCK-FIDDY"(controversial spelling so sue me). I met Cory Spitzer and     Nikko     Benson(among others) but they were the people who I played with before it was time for orientation so they stuck in my mind. The entire camp gathered in the rug room and we were waiting to see what was going to happen. One of the co-directors, Aram, got up and said that there was going to be a slight delay because one of the staff or spirits were late. He asked if anyone would like to get up and do something to entertain the crowd. After a moment of awkward silence, I stood up and said that I would do my Stand Up act. I want to be a comedian when I grow up, and I figured, what the heck, I can do it now and wow the crowd or I can save it for when I know them all at the talent show(I was almost sure there was going to be one, but I hadn't had time to check it out yet). I was really nervous, so I completely botched the first joke. After that, it was pretty much smooth sailing, and I received some laughs from the audience(enough that I stayed up through the entire act instead of sitting down) and when I finished I saw the musical introduction of the staff and spirits, and after that everything becomes indistinct. I met my cabin, and so started some of the most amazing times I have experienced so far in my life.

       This will be the start of a long and arduous journey through the exotic lands of South America. I hope to post as often as possible, but as internet connections in SA are not assured, I wont make any promises I can't keep. The beginning is near, and I am facing an uncertain future, fraught with unknown perils.  But enough of that drama. On with my story...
