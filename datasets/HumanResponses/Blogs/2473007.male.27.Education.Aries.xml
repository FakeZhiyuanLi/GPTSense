          Within human nature lies the crafty creature of Ignorance.  He has stolen truth from many a man with its subtle ways.  But the beast claims not only truth as victim; but beauty as well, for truth is beauty.  On occasion, this scaly-eyed monstor will wake and snatch the ability to appreciate beauty from the eyes and minds of unsuspecting man.  The ferocious hunter has taken the lives of many a sensitive soul who at one time pondered and cherished the commonplace, but have since fallen to the ranks of callousness.       The heart, however, must not leap with joy, considering itself blameless; for the beast does not stir unprovoked.  It is the constant prodding and poking of habit and banal predictability that causes Ignorance to stir.  How small an accomplishment is a sterile lifestyle!  Only through spontaneity and consistant marvel in the ill-termed "ordinary" can the beast be slain.       The man whose eyes have been blinded to the beauty in his surroundings can never be joyful.  He has become ignorant of delight in the mundance and finds himself without satisfaction in any circumstance.  Beauty has no qualifications.       The victims of this beast are piteous creatures indeed.  The sweet fragrance of a newborn lily escapes their senses.  The heavenly canvas delicately brushed cadmium and yellow-gold, tufted with milky white wisps is lost somewhere between their eyes and their hearts.  The whisper of a crickets song becomes mere annoyance and the glistening blade of grass is mown down in the name of habit.       This man, the man who no longer sees true beauty, has removed himself from God's divine symphony.  He moves from performer to observer.  Joining in at his own tempo, his own key signature, his own melody, the blind man hears only discord.  His own vain attempts at beauty are all that can be heard; and because he has deafened himself to the harmony surrounding him, the beauty and majesty of a world in perfect orchestration play on for others only, and he is left to hum his sad, lonely tune.       Complaceny, on the other hand, is not as blunt nor rugged a foe as Ignorance.  He has a tongue of silk and entreats his victims with subtle and palatable attacks.  Ignorance depends on Complaceny, for without a numbing agent, Ignorance is but fleeting.  Complacency steps in, rears its beautiful head and slyly presents himself as reason; he uses craftiness and pride to gain a permanent home in the heart of man.  His venom is sweet as he suggests that all is well in the mind of a man apart from beauty and truth.  He poses as beauty, defending his co-conspirator's actions as "bliss".  A life consumed by Complacency is crippled so that the road to the grave runs steep, plain, and sure.       So we stand today face to face with these dark ones.  Daily must the decision be made to wage war against these foes.  Will Ignorance and Complacency rule our lives, or will we fight to rejoice in the simple, choosing to recognized it as profound?  Will we make the common uncommon?  Bind Ignorance and Complacency; bind them tight and vow to find beauty in the ordinary.

      I've given up a time or two before, Half drowned by icy turmoil within. Emotions crest and break upon the shore, Drowning reason with their ever-present roar. I fight against the surge, but never win. I've given up a time or two before. A swell against the sand-the waves restore The smooth and untouched beauty once again. Emotions crest and break upon the shore. The icy fingers weave the ocean floor Drowning reason with their ever-present spin. I've given up a time or two before. My will comes broken, bleeding, washed ashore Beneath the rays of moonlight, small and thin. Emotions crest and break upon the shore, And things once right so often I deplore. Why must the mind be swayed by passing sin? I've given up a time or two before- Emotions crest and break upon the shore.

      I laugh a lot. I cry a lot.   Visions of greatness frequent my thoughts. Why must life be a cycle of day and night? A swell of joy and an ebb of tears     That wash over the wreckage of a life-         Smashed on the rocks of fate.     And tomorrow is another day.         Another day.         Another ship,     Or the same ship that was never wrecked...         Again?   The rainy season gusts and sprays And my life is almost shipwreck.   The dry season passes silent With a gull scream overhead. I sit silently. It is a good day for sailing.   I laugh a lot. I cry a lot.

      Dark shelves were made for hollow ornaments, Brightly twinkling and luring the eye, Sending slivers of colorless rainbows, Lightly tinkling a passionate song, Formed a dissonant melody slow.   Look deep to the fields through the circle of glass And the mist of the dew disappears. The diamond butterfly aimlessly flits From the rose with the rotting stem.   Pegasus starts and quivers his mane, Flaring nostrils-twitching ears- Bending slowly-grazing grass- Emerald-empty as space.   The ornament sits at a distance, Far enough to forbid more than glance. Why do they stare?   Dark emptiness, deep as the silent sparrow, Cold as the icy flames, Embraces and controls me- My comfort and my fear.

      The room is dark and my soul is alone;     Sharply cut by the blades of the whirring fan. I have lived many lives, and have died many deaths;     Now I lie like a broken crayon.   At once I filled many pictures with hue     Empty pages that once drew a colorless stare But the strokes that I made and the depth that I gave     Lie silent in numb disrepair.   My tears rum warm and my blood runs cold     As my mind lingers back - an expressionless face Has the life that I shared and the color I drew     Vainly tinged an unfillable space?   The room is dark and my soul is alone;     Sharply cut by the blades of the whirring fan. I have lived many lives, and have died many deaths;     Now I lie like a broken crayon.

      Another hectic day at Jon and Lisa Redford’s house had arrived, albeit not unusual; this had become a common occurrence some time ago.  Weekdays gave only enough time for work, sleep, and food, and weekends were jammed with things of little importance that needed doing.  They had only been married for a little over five years, but for Lisa it was beginning to feel like seventy-five.  It was one of those Saturdays where sugar-coated cereal and sleeping late seemed nothing but a distant memory, where cartoons and long days of unfettered imagination had become imagined things themselves.  And with those faded fables of some younger self swirling about in an overworked mind, and with far too much to do, Lisa glared at the old Hotpoint Refrigerator.  It always seemed so obnoxious hulking there in the corner of her kitchen, Lisa thought to herself.  So many indescribable things annoyed her about the outdated box.  Each time the compressor clicked on, every light in the house dimmed, and IT would grind, gnash, shriek and after its tantrum, let out a long, low mumble.  Lisa wanted a new refrigerator, but in a two-income society, they were lucky enough to have this one.  “Honey!” she cried.  Where was that man?  Lisa hated that she had to call him over and over to get his attention; but that seemed the extent of their relationship lately—nag and yell.  He was callous to her lately.  Wasn't it just last week she had sent him to the grocery store for milk, being absolutely sure to remind him three times; and still he came home with a carton of fudge ripple ice cream instead?  Why did he have to be so insensitive and care only about his own wants and needs?  Was he blind by sheer ignorance or by complacent choice?  Lisa concluded that she would have to move the refrigerator by herself, so she leaned up against it with her shoulder, and shoved.  It was much heavier than she thought it would be.  She strained and struggled just to slide the beast aside; and just as it began to budge, the sharp base of the refrigerator caught the linoleum floor and ripped it.  She growled—very loud and very frustrated—and sat down on the dirty floor.  It was Jon’s fault for not helping her.  She worked the same eight hours he did.  She came home just as tired and just as fed up with frustrating people; so why should he sit upstairs and watch reruns of old television shows while she did everything around the house?  The gash in the floor made her cringe.  She would move the refrigerator without his help.  She was strong; she could do it on her own.  After all, her early twenties were years of self-sufficiency, and she had learned to cope.  That she was thirty-five and married did not make her helpless.  With a renewed determination, she stood up, buried her shoulder into the side of the refrigerator, and strained.  The linoleum tore even wider.  Before she could react, a yellowed envelope that had been lodged between the back corner of the refrigerator and the wall fluttered to the ground.  It landed on its back, and on the front, in faded blue ink were written the words:  “My Vow, My Love.”  Memories flooded back to Lisa with waves of emotions.  She picked up the envelope and smelled it.  It smelled old and musty, but the smell of men’s cologne still lingered in her mind.  It had been so long!  The memories that came seemed so distant—like a dream.  How could she have forgotten that day in June when Jon handed her the very envelope she held in her hand?  The picture was so clear in her mind now.  It was exactly one month before they were to be married, and he was so shy and timid when they exchanged personal vows.  He shuffled his feet and looked down at the ground like an infatuated schoolboy, all the while apologizing if it sounded “juvenile” or “silly”.  She remembered reading it while Jon sat sat on the park bench, staring at his feet.  Tears welled up in Lisa’s eyes as she thought back on those tears not all to long ago.  The intense emotion swelled again as she thought of laughter, love and living life together.  The envelope crinkled as Lisa opened it carefully and pulled out the folded yellow paper.  It was exactly as she had remembered.  She closed her eyes and held the paper up to her lips; then, after a deep sigh, she opened the paper and read it again, five and a half years later:  “Here I stand before you, And vow to you my love.  I pledge myself eternal In the eyes of God above.  ‘I love you’ man’s divinest words, Though many times misleading, Convey my most elusive thoughts For you, and bear repeating.”  Was the man in front of the television upstairs the same young man who embraced and kissed her in absolute love?  Does time change true love?  She had become so consumed with the vain pursuits of life that somehow she had grown callous to the treasure before her.  The linoleum mattered very little now; the price of linoleum could not compare to the value of true love.    “Lee?”  Jon called from the top of the stairs.  “Come here for a minute.”  Lisa wiped away the tears and streaked mascara and headed to the stairs.  When she reached the top, Jon put his arm around her waist and opened their bedroom door.  The bed was made, the top of both dressers was clean, the floor was spotless, and the laundry had been folded and put away.  “Happy Anniversary.”  He kissed her gently on the cheek.

      The sun peered through the crytal sky Shafting down upon a world. Filled with towering beasts and untold wonders And skies with clouds unfurled.   Across the vast expanse of white and hard Plains gashed with mysterious monuments- Deep circles of black often raging with unseen heat- Came wanderers from below.   They marched across the desert, scorched by the heat Of the unknown as they pressed on Toward the looming corpse, The newly found victuals.   Out of the shadows, without warning, moved the giant. The looming beast hurled a giant foot And the party disbanded as soldiers were flung and crushed At the unknown whim of receding Colossus.

      There is a mystery behind flickering neon signs;     The scent of saltwater and fish on the pallid air     Breathed out with an exasperated sigh     By a tired city. Drones, hums and rumbles laced with laughter,     So many noones screaming for attention yet     Absent of humanity; devoid of soul     Save one cry. Stale winds and gaping lights almost dry the tears     While bodies continue to move in the night and     Streetlights continue to change     Silently, mechanically. Death, life and heaven now abide in some other place,     Agreed by everyone and noone in particular     To remain extinct and unspoken     Or else denied. The house of cards cannot comprehend its makers frailty;     Swallowed up in the beauty of itself,     While a divine breath     Topples the deck. Mysterious is the wonder we have assembled     As reality lies in pieces on the desert floor.

      With mixed emotions I felt death strike     Sitting in a crowded coffee house on a damp night     Surrounded by a city of dead people that smiled and laughed         And spoke of life.   I smiled through the pleasant pain of     Losing some vague connection with an obscure past     Tasting mint espresso and the overwhelming sense of small         And being man.   The falling sky seemed to wash my mind     Of tender stalks of grass or infinitely high trees     Melting away into the dark streets, swept away by the streams         Into a drain.   I hear the laughter and I smell smoke     Curling at the ceiling, not unlike clouds; as a boy     Watching the temporary masterpieces drifting away         Forever gone.   With mixed emotions I felt death strike. With a quiet painless blow, Someone died within.

      My soul cries out with the deepest plea for heaven To bring me a kindred spirit knit so tightly to my very soul     That I cannot move or breathe without the spirit of that          One moving or breathing beside me. I have tasted a summer closeness that died with The first bite of autumn frost; the ripe communion, so     Soft and sweet and satisfying to the soul as cold water to parched lips,         Lay brown and consumed by death. Just to see the seasons, sun and rain, move us as one Mind, body and soul ever closer to closeness; Ever     Amazed at the mere whisper of the truest words         Spoken with and without voice. To become life clearer and brighter and completely base; Existing only within the thoughts and events of each other,     Vaguely aware of the disappearing peripheral, and yet         Intensely alive with singular vision. A soulmate - not merely a disciple or a lover or even a deep-seated friend, But a yearning for the other that placed not even self before them,     Passionately connected eternally with something deeper         Than smiles and words and perfume. I lay down in the grass and weep     To love one with every moment given to love, and     To be loved by a soulmate.

      Today I lost a treasure.     I held each one in my arms and whispered farewell.     Each one seemed so real, but now-     All that exists is the echo of them. Listening in this silence     I hear nothing save the mind's voice that plays,     And plays, and would play, and soon forgets. I have always imagined the worst tragedy in life     Is not losing your mind, but     Forgetting you ever had one. So I close my eyes and see your faces And love you with an unexplainable love,         And an undiminshed memory-         A portrait in my mind.     Of sunshine smiling faces that have been imprinted on my heart.         But I shudder at the thought:         Each time I feel the imprint it becomes less distinct and sharp.     Of slow-moving, sweeping goodbyes that are stroked onto the mind's canvas.         But I shudder at the thought:         Each nostalgic sweep of my hands on its texture wears and dulls it. The truest and most alive memories, then Must be made and remade each moment     With the chisel of rememberence     Shaping the mind's marble.

      A number of years ago, fewer than I care to admit, I finally came to the point where I saw the Christian life clearly and I was faced with two great paths: self-denial and self-indulgence.  Decisions could either be made because it was what I wanted, or because it was what I knew was right.  Fortunately, the two often coincided in my life; but without a conscientious choice the outcome would be left to the impulse of the moment--very dangerous.   So which path did I take?  I was afriad of sacrifice; I was afraid of where that road would lead; or more honestly what the road may require.  I enjoyed moderate indulgence.  Taking that road, however, plunged me into a realm I had not known previously.  It was a place where Sathan, who had in times past tempted me physically, was tempting me intellectually.  He approached me with the reasoning, "If you live a self-sufficient life, why not thing self-sufficient thoughts?"   You see, I still acted righteous and did "good" things in the eyes of men; but it was hypocrisy because at the base of my decision was the fact that I was doing what I wanted to do.  And of course, a philosophy of life has a way of changing even the strongest of habits, especially at college where hundreds of voices innundate, calling different directions.  The Bible makes it clear--a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.   So the entire struggle stemmed from the day I said no to self-sacrifice; some of the strongholds have remained thanks to godly parents.  Sadly, though, I had to go through the process of tearing down beliefs before I realized that the only reason I was tearing them down was because they were as vacant as an abandoned house; my actions had long since moved out and so why believe something you're not acting upon.  I have only just begun to realize that one or the other must go--the faith not demonstrated by actions or the actions not based in faith.  After examining both...   EMPTY ACTIONS MUST GO... I CHOOSE FAITH!

      "It took the wise men longer to find through wisdom what the shephers found through revelation."     -Keith Gardner    They were willing to give time, effort and reputation to seek the Savior-child, and they were not satisfied until the found Him.  They knew who to worship and they brought Him gifts that cost them something.  If you want to love Him more, give Him that which you value...   Being a wise man means more that pointing at a star in the sky... It means more than standing and watching the Savior... It means giving expensive gifts... It means traveleing across great distances... It means RISKING YOUR LIFE to worship the Messiah...

      November air, sharp and cool and still     Here I lie. Engulfed within a field of swaying dreams;     As they stare- The pin-pricked sparks on eternal light-     Can you hear them whisper?   An opal moon yawns a great white light That washes the world in a lucid illusion.   My mind is lulled by the silence of a million stars     Back into dark woods     With milky blades piercing the sky;     And the carpet of pine     Softens my step.   The air was warm then and I was young;     Imaginations played their games     And fireflies light the heart     While embers of eternity      Soften the passage of time.

      A sliver slipped beneath the skin Of one whose soul bore pain within; This broken body, rent and torn, Lay trembling on a dew-touched morn. The hand of Conscience, beaten, red Moved slowly down the wood and bled. An angry heaven wept its light As if to make the darkness right, And purge the valley from its sin, Its shame, its blood, its slaughtered kin.   Beneath the gentle, brushing trees, A woman weeping, on her knees; Sweet Reason dressed in mourner's black Shed tears and called her lover back: "Awake. awake!" This man of sense Was father to sweet Innocence-- Sweet Innocence with purest skin And purer still a heart within. But she was gone, and he lay dead As Reason hung her graying head.   The something broke the revered hush, And looking up into the brush She saw Indulgence, clothed in Pride. He did not run; he did not hide. He only sheathed the bloody knife That stole from Conscience precious life, And smiled at the doing's done; Indulgence smiled, for he had won. And there--embraced by nature's floor-- The man of Conscience stood no more.

      Awakened by the sound of retreating sun and advancing moon,     A tired soul lies silent in the throes of time, Staring blankly with tear-rimmed eyes into a future     Filled with familiar strangers that know him all too well. A thousand voices fading haunt him from behind,     Yet nonexistant sounds of hope ring clear from tomorrow's hill. The same stroke of three hundred and sixty-four midnights     Moves mountains this night; And a moment sends ripples across a mirror lake,     Smoothed by time and unchanged by human nature- Tears peircing the reflection of myself.

      Beneath the eyes of heaven, dusty shadows push the sun westward,     Into the dark night beyond, without sound, save Cattle moving endlessly through fields of black grass, gently crushed. Black forms eagerly approach that sleep of death,     With thick poison climbing like clover honey.   Peach pits break teeth in the midst of sweet nectar while     Children laugh. Children laugh, and small children watch as death greets them     From a bloodwashed sky; And old men wash away former death with frothy glasses of future death.   Like a thundering herd, the multitude rushes with dust and darkness     Toward the sea, the burning sea; So anxious to escape fire they immerse themselves in hell.

      The battlefield is set and each warrior is numbed by the blood pounding in his ears and the sound of an uncertain tommorrow.  Like a deathly breeze, the wind of a hundred thousand frightened men gasping and blowing their last breath sweeps across the the field and dark spots appear before their eyes.  Without warning, like the sudden bursting of some long-dammed river, the lines break, and gutteral screams of unearthly measure rise from the field and like the crashing of ocean upon rock, men crash upon men with blood red foam.  Swords and spears sparkle in the mid-day sun; but no warmth flows here, save the blood of the angry.  Cold steel plunges deep into warm flesh and bites hard.  The cold is victorious and it recklessly plunges forward, driving warmth away into the dark night.  So the enemy lay slaughtered among the friends and I sit and weep for the coming of darkness, the death of innocence and the sorrow of the stars.

      It is darkness, and I do not dare open my eyes.  Pressing my lids tighter, the retinal fireworks explode and celebrate fear's victory, while the prisoner lays quivering in his bed.  Somewhere, a thousand miles away perhaps, a grandfather clock swings its long pendulum and beats each passing moment into my ears as my heart beats out of my chest.   Eyes open would only confirm darkness.  Holding them closed is the only consolation, the only hope that what I fear does not exist and will not smother me as I lay.  Deep thoughts mingle with shallow breaths and soon my mind is sinking steadily downward like a stone, a boulder, a ship torn open.   With a flash of imagined light the eyes flutter open and breathing stops.   Breath.   Ringing... whistling... my name spoken?   Breath.   Hissing... piercing... my name spoken?   Then, before me, in honey-like motion, I see the life, the choices, the games, the loves, the fears, the yearning of a young man.  And in a jukebox voice, someone inaudibly whispers my name and I have tears.

      If God truly sees and cares about our pain and suffering, why does it still exist?  How can a loving God watch and even orchestrate this tragedy in our lives?   A simple yet appropriate example may shed some light on this divine paradox.  Anyone familiar with the board game Monopoly can remember the small orange card stating: "Get Out Of Jail Free".  When a player picks up that card, it is exciting to think that they have the ability to escape jail free of cost; but the only way they can experience the promise and power of the card is to end up in jail.   It is difficult yet true.  Only when we find ourselves in difficulty do we really experience the fullness of God's mercy and goodness.  Jesus Himself stated that the whole needed no doctor; only those who are sick need healing.  So we find that in order for God to be most valuable to us, we must be in a place where He is most needed.  That's why Paul states that "His strength is made perfect" in our weakness; because there is a need and He can fulfill it.     Just as a life jacket in the desert is of little value, so would the greatness and power of God be meaningless had we no need.

      The sound of gentle morning woke me     From a night of painful thought; Dreams beneath the sea of darkness     Swirling upward brought   A weakened soul to sweet cessation,     Resting on some distant shore, Warming under skies of mercy,     Safe forevermore.

      Dandelion Wine is an amazing book about making the common things in life uncommon and about enjoying again with childlike wonder the world around us; if you have never read this book, you should do so within the next two weeks.   Bradbury captures with inviting imagery and memorable passion the simplicity and beauty of youth. Douglas Spaulding, the book's main character, becomes Bradbury's medium through which he can experience childhood over again, yet now through the eyes of aged wisdom.  The book is more than just a story about a child growing up.  It is a process of removing the callouses from a soul hardened by time and banal predictability; the renewal of wonderment.   One of the subplots of the book is the creation of a "happiness machine" which would allow the user to artificially experience any happiness; but the machine could only plant within the user an insatiable desire for what was not real.  It could only demonstrate the wonders of what could not be had; and in so doing, it destroyed the true happiness-it's one goal-that comes only from acceptance and indulgence in the everyday.   Bradbury also uses an amazing symbol for memories - wine; and not just any wine, dandelion wine.  Dandelions, dreadfully common, often viewed as a nuisance, are pressed into wine which grows sweeter with time.  Each summer of simplicity and commonplace is bottled into a delicious vintage of uncommon commonness that is then stored to be enjoyed in years to come.   The key that Bradbury gives for true happiness is contentment, but a higher contentment than simply sordid acceptance.  The contentment that he pictures in Dandelion Wine is an antonym of complacency; the premise is that we must see the profound in the simple and find beauty in the ordinary.

      Sometimes life bluffs us into thinking that this world is a great, cosmic poker game. Some are dealt unlucky hands and some just seem to have all the aces tucked up their sleeve. And everyone thinks you need a good hand to win.   But God is no respecter of person, which means that he cannot be partial in his dealings to any one man or woman. Therefore the differences we see from person to person - height, weight, color, race, gender, family status, economic background-are not "unfair advantages". These variables may give us different standing in the world’s view; but in God’s eyes, variety is rather the raw material for a life of honor to Him. He rejects no one for being "different" - to do so would be hypocrisy for these are His very strokes on the canvas of humanity.  The tiny deaf child speaks in mumbled noises and we shake our head in sadness. A ragged man sits on the curb and bangs his tin can and we look away with a forced smiled. The ever present talker who seems to think of no one but himself follows us like a swarm of bees and we mumble under our breath… as if these "creatures" were any less deserving of God’s love than our pious self.  God forbid. We have grown so self-righteous that in our minds salvation comes to us because of who we are. What we have forgotten is that every righteous deed done in our own strength and for our glory is so vile and so absolutely repulsive that we might better wheel a cart of manure up to the pulpit Sunday morning and dump the entire cart out before the congregation. If we are created for His pleasure and for His glory, to live any other way is rebellion; that is why the wicked are damned.

      So often we build for ourselves a house of cards that can so easily be shaken, yet we refuse to admit our own frailty.  And still we cannot comprehend the fact that we are not the makers of our destiny.   Sometimes we create for ourselves a future.  We look through the window of tomorrow and we see ourselves enjoying our own creation of what should be.  Yes - dreams and aspiration play an important role in any person's life, but when we set them up as golden calves and begin to worship them above the will of God, problems ensue.   So where does that leave us?  Do we become fatalists and conclude that nothing can be done in our own power and therefore nothing can be done?  God forbid!  We ought to pursue that which is right, and even that which we appropriately desire, as long as we remain bendable.  The moment our desires and our realities begin to take control, there is a dangerous paradox and we become hollow and useless, having no connection with the reality of God's sovereignty.

         He stood alone on a dark hillside and watched the world.  Lights blinked and the wind whispered mysteries to the midnight stars.  The hill before the young man undulated in the moonlight as each stalk of untouched wheat moved to the will of the brisk October air.  There was a town there beneath him, an eternity away, but it could only be seen and contemplated, never touched.  With one eye closed he could pinch the tallest building between his thumb and forefinger.  It all seemed so insignificant to him now; the father and son that he could not see sitting in different rooms, afraid; the man and woman he could not hear flinging hurtful words, angry.  He sat on the hill with the moonlight gently kissing his cheek and the earthy scent of vegetation swirling around him.     A dew began to settle on his neck, though, and almost unconsciously he realized that he was cold.  The peace of the night and the quiet symphony of wheat has brought him here and shown him a repose; but the lights of town called him as a mother calls her child when the sun is setting.  "Come and rest.  There is time for life tomorrow.  Yet another day."  So I make my way home only to find the sun rising the next morning; and I must become part of the town which only the night before I held between my fingers.

      I wandered last night.  Moving around through the desolate cities creates almost a false sense of refinery.  For some reason each time I turn a corner and I'm greeted by hundreds of buildings I feel as though mankind as achieved something... yet it's a strange paradox.  The streets are ghostly on their own.  The freezing glare of the store fronts seem wicked apart from the hustle of people.  A busy street carries a certain charm, I must admit; but without the people, a city is an amazingly empty place.   Nature, on the other hand, holds a certain ability to posses beauty apart from man... usually more so the less man is involved.  A empty canyon still rings with magnitude and perhaps a sense of man's SMALLNESS.  Nighttime in a dark wood is a harrowing experience; but it haunts us not because of it's death, but because of it's life.  The possibility of danger creates fear.  In an empty city, though, the solitude of emptiness creates something a bit different than fear.  It could perhaps be better described as futility - the hollow empty feeling that everything man attempts is worthless.   Staring at the dark tangerine store fronts and listening to the faint hum of a sleeping city creates that gap... it can only best be described as that.  An urge... a gap... a hunger.  The empty pangs you feel when you are hungry but only within your soul and your mind this time.  And it feels so insatiable!  It is as though your hungering can only be forgotten, never filled.   Smoky air breathed in by hollow people.  There is something soothing about coffee houses - in a strange almost disconcerting way.  Again, only man's best.  I wish I were sitting on a quiet dock by a midnight lake with the constant breeze and the blinking lights of the far shore.  The subtle slap of the water against the slimy wooden posts... the slow moving stars and the occassional cloud.  Scents of pine, wet wood and damp earth.  And the only other noise is the occasional blowing of a moose or the obvious gurgle of a jumping bass.

      People walking down the street, saying everything is fine. They can see it coming, but they don't have time. Everyone is moving-Hell prepares her gates- Entering eternity and finding it too late. People open up your eyes.   Strangely it seems that we've lost our sense of sight, Walking in the shadows, so afraid to show the light. See the souls so damned, or is there nothing left to see? You've tasted every pleasure, is there nothing left for me? Anywhere?  Anyway?  Can you spare some change?   Mr. Sentimental cries, and Mrs. Harlot plays, While hypocritics say the Word, and everybody pays. Do you see the harvest?  Do you even care? Too busy with adultery to even take the dare? People open up your eyes.   Strangely it seems that we've lost our sense of sight, Walking in the shadows, so afraid to show the light. See the souls so damned, or is there nothing left to see?

      A talkative brook, 20 feet wide and the color of burnt midnight, runs by on the left.  Patches of translucent sepia glow in sun-formed patterns.  The stream speaks with the voice of a thousand whispers, taking occasion to slap the air with its wetness.  Ever-appearing foam streaks accentuate the lumbering, potato-like stones.  A mossy stick in all its daring leaps by on the tiny rapids.   The banks on this side are tufted this year's swamp cabbage, trillium, and Jack-in-the-pulpit, pushing their way up and through last year's foliage.  The far shore boasts a waterfall that would drench an ant, but that would do little for a chipmunk.  A leaking faucet, it dribbles out of a mound of root and moss, down a velvet-green stone and into the great river, to be carried into the ocean.  Two felled pine-trees, now barkless, lie half-submerged in the water's flow with bits of twig, leaf, and heaps of dirty foam backing up like a New Jersey interstate.   Further up-stream, in a small place spared of the forest's thickness, delicate violet's congregate like powder-scented ladies after Sunday morning service.  Fully-formed swamp cabbage suns its leaves, giving the clearing an emerald glow.  Another downed pine tree spills its time-worn innards, dusted with the tell-tale red decay.   The sun is warm, the temperature fair, and a gentle breeze cools.  Springtime growth is only enough to catch a glimpse of green explosions to come.  The conifers are full, but only a few coin-leafed deciduous are showing their colors.  A knotty pine spreads its roots away from the trunk in a vein-like mound, half-covered with moss and pine needles, like gnarled fingers of some primordial beast.   I smell earthy and fresh air, with a mellow mineral edge.  The forest floor is damp and loamy, covered in fallen needles.  Hulking roots, rough and solid, veins of arborious life.  With crisp, crackling stems, a few weeds, long-dead, still stand.  Soft, velvet and damp mossy trunks tower into dusk-gray, looking like petrified squash.     I close my eyes and hear the forest breathing; wind, unseen, through boughs of endless trees whispering in small eddies of streams.  The unchanging sun gazes down while the cool touch of damp grass on my hands speaks peace.

      I am afraid, Lord.   My soul is aching and I weep for the passion that does not exist.  Our lives are too easy, too difficult - a paradox of crippling proportions.  The only thing worth having is painfully eating away at me until I am afraid of death, but to forsake the painful necessary is to embrace a deadly pleasure.  Sweet nectar that pleases the palette but rots the belly.  Only clutching the worthwhile, the painful, the searing flames that devour all things but that golden nugget of truth, I find purpose and vitality.

      He was an outcast with a doomed directive.  His cries would go unheeded and his tears would fall unnoticed.  The only comfort Jeremiah could find in this life was the assurance that he was right, and the only protection he knew was in the arms of God.  He forsook the world to embrace the message of God and gave up all earthly value to do so.   Poor trade?  Looking through eyes still doubt-blinded, perhaps.  Some clay, spittle and faith may help us see through our tears to what Jeremiah had long ago fixed his eyes on... that bright and blessed hope that makes all of today's heartaches a drop of water in the sun of eternity.

      Change... Jingles in the pocket of my faded jeans As I shift to my right leg and wait for the man     In the telephone booth. His jaw is pumping and his veins have surfaced While his wrath is being poured out     On a six inch piece of hard plastic. His hands flail in time to his rantings, Muted bellows about: Change... Cool and hard as it slips and plinks down Into the inner workings of a single mechanical tentacle     Of a giant squid Writhing and pulling  At the timbers of this ship,    Then, almost as a warning-  A tone, then a voice, Cooly informing me of: Change...

      I was wandering along some sooty black street     When I came across an ugly green dumpster. Inside I found a frightened young woman.  Her     Hair was tangled and greasy black, face smeared With grime - dark, dirty circles under endless hazel eyes.     She looked up at me from within her cage, a Wild animal in this urban jungle.  Her body quivered     As though I were about to strike her.  Instead, I brushed A damp newspaper aside and put my hand on her shoulder.     "Maria."  My voice was barely audible.  Her eyes Opened wide in surprise.  "You know my name?"  Her fear     Reminded me of a small child.  I reached around her Shoulders and pulled her up gently toward me; there was     A hesitancy, then she gave herself up. What was left of her wasted frame I scooped up into     My arms and carried to my car, to her salvation.

      A very dear friend of mine passed away today quite unexpectedly.  About an hour after I heard the news, the sun was blood red in the sky and it balanced on the horizon.  A soul not long ago burned brightly in my sky, but his sunset came and now he is gone.  He was a great man who always looked to God for his strength, and always showed others what a joyous Christian was.  Gene Krott, I miss you dearly, and I cannot wait to see you in heaven.  This poem is for you.   The final warming rays of sunset whispered, waning,     Pouring out his last sweet song- A feircesome, gentle stroke of beauty, sweetly paining,     Though each shadow growing long Told us of his soon departure.  Always gleaming,     Always sure to luminesce, Yet now his Maker bids him onward, moonlight streaming,     Leaving us to midnight guess. We shed our tears in desperation, craving daylight,     Staring at a blackened sky, And question every summer's midday.  Always finite,     Darkness fills the earthen eye, But hope lies not in mortal measure.  Unseen, moving,     Warming shores of distant lands, The hand of God protects our sunlight, one day we will     See the sunrise without end.

      To truly be amazed by nature, we must we willing to be both sensitive and curious.  We  must also become truly honest and admit that we have become unaware of the commonplace.  It takes getting to the place where you can pull a leaf apart, piece by piece and revel in it; where you can lay on your belly in knee-high grass and explore the hidden ground beneath; where you can watch each cloud as though it was the first breath of life exhaled by the nostrils of God.  Man has become amazed at himself - his glimmering car, his rich new clothes, his elaborate new house.  All of these take lifetimes for most to obtain, and yet a far greater treasure lies easily within our grasp and most simply mow it down or plow it up.  Tear away the beautiful to create our own beauty.  Break apart the Grecian urn to make room for the half-baked clay jar.  It is truly sad.   Sad, not simply because some have fallen prey to ignorance, but because those that have tear others down with them, and worse yet, create a new standard of beauty.  To stand amazed beneath the stars is passe.  To marvel at a snowflake is frivolous.  This is what the blind ones tell us, and those with clouded eyes believe it.  They sink their teeth deep into the fruit because they want to surpass Divinity, but reality laughs at them and they are like small children flaunting their muddy masterpieces.

      The reflection of the streetlights ripple and dance like flames on the surface of the water, while the fountain churns its unending chorus of subtle harmony.  Cars move on the far side of the lake, devoid of sound and soul.  The bats move erraticly above me, diving and shifting and casting their terrible shadows on frightened children...   The lake is on fire with street lights, but something deeper capsizes my attention.  The reason bodies of water are so captivating to me is that they reflect the endless sky.  The sky is amazing because it is truly limitless.  The adage "the sky's the limit" has dulled us into seeing only what appears and has hidden from us that which is real.  Beyond the particles of air that refract the suns light and give us daylight exists undeniable proof of man's inability.  Across heaven's dome lie millions of glowing pinpricks unveiled with the retiring sun; but more prominent, and perhaps less obvious, the blanket of empty space on which they exist.  Eternal unending nothingness from which our eyes can only gather nonexistence.  How unfathomable to the skeptic who must see to believe!  What must go through the mind of a man who determines truth by his ability to comprehend.

      We make God very small when we indulge in our selfish pride.  When our desires and our agendas outweigh godly choices, we belittle Divinity to the point of erecting ourselves as the golden calf.  Self becomes god.  Humanity knows better than Divinity.  Why would the created push the Creator into obscurity?  Would we truly consider ourselves as the omniscient authority if we captured but a glimpse of Heaven?  Perhaps we grow haughty because of God's silence.  Nature screams His existence, but in a world of urban wonders the nonexistant stars are deathly silent.  Those lights that do shine are powered by a Divine nature that has been delegated into the hands of a beurocratic mankind and the person of God is reduced to dark suits and conference tables.

      Surrounded by the great expanse of cold and empty night     The ever-moving flow still reaches in, With frigid fingers clutching at some nonexistant light-     A fruitless search for deity in sin. The breathing sky moves ocean tide and stirs the waters on,     'Til land and sea meet violent in foam; And yet I watch them flow again to darker night beyond,     Alive only to live and be alone. If only day would come at last and kiss the dying sea,     The fearful chop made calm by heaven's breath; If only sun would melt the night and make these captive free,     Then life would be victorious over death.

      At the dawn of the winter, the rose lies, hard-pressed     'Gainst its crystalline coffin of snow. It's mid-summer splendor could never have guessed     Of the sharp biting winds it now knows.   The blood of the red seems quite stark in contrast     To the pale deadly white of the frost; Yet the flair slips away from its full-flowered past     And the brilliance of summer is lost.   What once was immortal seems quite mortal indeed     As the soft summer rose passes on. Whether delicate flower or lingering weed,     All are here for a time, then are gone.   Is love, then, condemned to such seasons of time-     To bloom then be crushed by the storm? A rose is but earthly; true love is divine-     Eternal, unending and warm.

      Bring me back to the place Where my heart began to race, And I could almost see your face     With eyes that saw the unseen.  Faith was new and flames were bright. We walked together through the night, And all I wanted was your light.     My sin has made me unclean.   Hollow spaces in my soul- Sweet revival make me whole; Holy Spirit take control,     Bring a love that's higher. Duty calls and drives me on, Where has my desire gone? Bring me back to mercies dawn.     Fill me with your fire.   My Jesus, I want to want you. Please take me in your arms; And make this empty have to, want to. Open wide the prison bars.     Please fill me up inside with a holy need,     To give you all I am and I want indeed Just to somehow, somewhere find My long, lost Love.

      We hid ourselves.     That gentle voice that times before had welcomed us,     Now sought us out.   We trembled.     In the cool of the day as we crouched motionless     Listening to our racing pulse,         Our stifled breath,         His approaching steps.   He called.     Not for knowledge sake, but for ours.             For mine. Shall His peircing eyes now bring me to my knees,     Or to my own defense?

      The night is bright here with an artificial light.  Stale, crisp blue and orange lights flood the hard edges of the trucks and cement, making everything pale and unnaturally colored.  The night is also quiet save the enormous growl and snarl of long wide-eyed monsters - dirty, smoking and tired.  The air moves inconspicuously from somewhere down the dark road and stops here to explore - to inquire lazily at each gas pump and window.  Past the mirrored image of inverse neon signs and deep-orange clouds, two men with matted gray hair and full beards stare into their coffee.  A sleepy waitress moves around slowly, aware only of her work; and yet she wears a distanced face as if tomorrow held something dreaded or perhaps pleasant.  Everything is so unusually still and somehow I feel much more alive - it is late, but my senses are keenly aware.

      I stood atop the roof of my school building today, the building in which I teach freedom and love, and I watched as the horizon was smudged with the thick, black smoke of terror and hatred.  The hallways echoed with tragedy and children looked out the window at nothing, perhaps visualizing a scenario, almost unthinkable to the innocent, in which the innocent die.  And while they imagined hell, it was swallowing up Manhatten not thirty miles away.   I never dreamed there would come a day when I would have to comfort a child facing the harrowing thought that mom may not be coming home.  Everyone expects the teacher to have things under control; everyone knows the teacher has all the answers.  No one ever suspects that tears are hiding just behind the corners of my eyes.   When the first plane crashed, I was shocked.  When the second plane crashed, I stood in disbelief.  After recieving word that the Pentagon had been hit, I began to be afraid.  But as I watched each tower fall in flaming ruin, my heart fell with almost as much devestation.  What shook me was the loss of stability.  The building was damaged, and what a grievous thought; but when the mighty had fallen, when the Twin Towers had disappeared forever, all sense of security and safety was stolen from me.  I became vulnerable.   Vulnerability can mean one of two things.  I can stand alone, open to attack and almost certain destruction; or I can look for an embrace in the Arms of One who can protect me.  I am afraid, and I don't want to be in the valley of the shadow of death alone.   Father, protect me.  Protect us as a nation.

      I stood outside tonight and gazed up at a full brilliant moon laid carefully against the night sky, and a pure, unfettered realization of everything struck me.  We as humans live our lives, and for whatever reason - perhaps sheer practicality - our thoughts dwell only on the immediate.  Only those things that have any direct bearing in our lives are taken into account; the "unnecessary" is often discarded in an attempt to streamline reality.  But this night I looked up at that glowing ball of rock and I thought of almost everything.   The tiniest particle of dust on the surface of the moon...  the most horrible fish that lurks beneath the deepest waters... the brother and sister playing poker in a lakeside cabin... the reader reading this... the hopes of those who have been and the memories of those to come...  So very many things, here and there, then and now, real and unreal, which constitute our world.   And the air was crisp tonight.   Strange how a shining orb in the sky can take a mind so many places; and yet that luminescent disc is a tremendous mass of stone held in place by the invisible Hands of God.  The grass beneath my feet struggles to push its way forth out of this enormous planet spinning its way around an enormous star in an even more enormous universe.  And here I stand, a tiny man made up of infinitely smaller particles and infinitely larger dreams.  Within this three and a half pound head full of gray matter is an unfathomable imagination and an eternity of lives lived by those who do not exist.   The seconds count off on the clock while the years - lifetimes - count off in my mind.  Voices of the past repeat themselves in the silence of the city, desires of the soul press the heart into breaking, and tears in my eyes flow for things I have not done and may never do.  If I could only disappear and become all things; to experience the world not as a participant but as a whole.  The grief, the joy, the death, the life, the pain, the pleasure all mingled together to create a sense of completion.   "That sleep of death" is only a part; to experience only that would be to miss the entirety of this life.  Yet to only partake of life is to never enter that "undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns."  There is no fear in these; they are but a small part of a larger picture, and to capture the entire image is to understand the beauty and the skill of its Creator.   But for now I must sit and listen.  A cricket's song contributes to the midnight air as do my thoughts the midnight hour.  I am just a man, wracked with limitation; these are just ideas, take them as you will.

      God commanded me, Jeremiah, to go and plead with Jerusalem and tell them these words:  “I remember the kind nation you were when you were young.  I remember the love we shared when you were willing to follow Me into a wild and unsettled land.  You were pure and you were Mine, and I considered you the firstfruits among all nations.  Anyone that brought offense to you would experience my wrath.”  Listen, Israel, because this is what God says:  “Did your ancestors find any fault in me so as to bring you to this vain pursuit of vain things?  None of them sought My presence, even after I had brought them through the wilderness—a land of deserts, drought and the lonely fear of death.  I brought them—I brought you—to this bountiful place to enjoy its goodness; but when you came in, you corrupted it and made My reputation an outrage.  The priests no longer sought me, the teachers no longer knew me, the leaders sinned against me, and even the prophets turned to empty actions and began to prophesy in the name of Baal.”  “And still I plead with you, and with your children and grandchildren.  Look over the breadth and width of your land and see if what I say is true.  Do you see a nation with new gods?  Truly you have become a nation with no God at all!  You have taken magnificence and exchanged it for worthlessness.  Be speechless, oh bleak sky, and be horrified at this tragedy.  For my people have committed two great evils:  they have abandoned the unending fountain of life, and they have made for themselves cisterns—broken cisterns—that cannot hold water."

      Hatred is the most alone feeling; it tears itself away from everything including those who indulge it.  Red hot hatred that stirs at any provocation can do nothing but sear the bearer of its rage; it has taken from those who possess it any sense of decency, because with it comes a sense of meaninglessness.  This, of course, is a paradox, because hatred flaunts itself as some overwhelming cause when in reality it is as empty and dangerous as a broken glass--unable to hold any other emotion and ready to cut any who dare touch.   Hatred is very much like being buried alive.  So alone, so all alone, and so captive to fear.  No one to hear you scream, but you must.  You must cry to the ears that won't hear, and you must calm the heart by your tears.  But hatred is so much more dangerous than even this, because a man buried alive can only be alone and afraid; but a man with hate can harm.  In his lonely fear he can fling words and actions that can pierce the soul of another--pierce them so that they too become infected with the infection that rots from withing--hatred.

      I'm afraid Christianity has become a killer.   In all fairness, this needs to be rephrased.  Genuine Christianity is not to blame here; that which our Lord taught is beautiful and right.  But a misnomer has taken place and that which was once true Christianity - an honest following after Christ - has been substituted with a hollow self-righteousness with the same name.   What is now often called Christianity is a religion that tires men because pretenses drive its cause.  To fit into the "Christian mold" we must dance a jig and speak our own personalized jargon.  If you do not hate what has always been hated, or do not love what has always been loved, you do not have "true spirituality".  The amazing thing about spirituality, though, is that it must be judged in spiritual terms.  All to often we apply our material ruler to a man's spirit and call out a verdict to others who share the same lack of understanding and misplaced focus.   Jesus offered a yoke that was easy and a burden that was light, but our religion has turned from wing to ball and chain.  So much is expected, and we must fit the "Christian stereotype" to be considered godly; but God has worked through shepherd, harlots, cowards and kigs.  Why have we now excluded them when our very Father has embraced them and called them friends?   We discovered a way to streamline our faith.  It is easy.  There are no questions, only answers.  All difficulties are cleanly tucked out of sight and everything you ever need to know is found on a shelf in some Christian bookstore.  Perfect for a nation of consumers.   This Creator, who craved intimacy with His creation so strongly that He was willing to stoop to our level, made us to be dependent.  Why now do we think He is satisfied with such self-sufficiency?

      Because we must face truth.  We must procure a reason for our fear, for our weakness.  He does not settle for lies or convenient phrases, but for TRUTH - truth so pure and so stark that self in never comfortable.  And the real truth is that we are utterly without hope.  So our hatred is abated because while His demand for truth burns like fire, His offer of grace gives us our only hope.

      There is a thief in my living room, and he is entertaining me.  Pouring out his theoretic heart, baring his nonexistent soul, yet never passing up a joke or an exciting comment - he's been there for me through it all.  Despite loss or pain, his words always cover my woes and captivates my attention.  Every day he kills me and I smile.  I never have to wonder if he will speak with me, because his pleasantries are unending.  He does not hear me; still he knows my feelings and desires and tells me that I am not alone in this world.  So I blindly give up my life, my friendships, and my talents for him, because it is much easier to hear life spoken of than to actually live.

      The entire universe is swallowed up in frozen cream     Scooped from heaven and heaped upon treetops. Children bury naked hands deep and let the beauty     Burn its icy heat beneath the unending whiteness. Diamonds plunge earthward onto eager tongues,     Dissolving instantly into innocent laughter As pure as the untouched flake from the silver sky,     Hanging, suspended between heaven above and heaven below While angels rest on front lawns And the world is again good.

      Sunlight fades, and now decends the unnamed fear that haunts both mind and body with a horrible horror-untamed, unaccepted, believed and all essentially true.   But beauty bursts upon the scene and takes away breath, stops a heart and opens tired eyes.   Somewhere a stream is flowing and covering a dry, parched soul; and most surely that dry, parched soul is my own, and the sweet refreshing flow is beauty.

      "The sugar of vanity, the honey of truth"  -Mary Oliver   Having sipped the froth off of a malt-barley day and having taken into account every mortal thing, I sit and I weep.  They are tears of salt-mourning that come because no one longs for truth.  Men that felt hot lead in their heart and cold steel on their neck because some blaze within them would not stop until the world was set afire-they are dead, and with them the conviction of the thing.   Shall we lick pleasantly at the many-colored confections of pride and greed?  Do we suck at them vainly until our teeth rot?   But when the amber flow - that sweetness not lacking in substance - glistens in the mid-December sun... taste it.  Its thickness is refreshing, and its goodness will remind you that things do, in fact, taste better with truth.

      Midnight slumber flows thick through slient room; Well-dressed, well-kept, and well-nigh destitute Of hope that spurns the weary soul to sing. Eyes, long-dry, crammed tightly against a brain That throbs and throbs as insanity beats His painful rhythym, open to behold Nothing, save the fear of reality. Fear, and an empty room where once lay love, Of touch and another and of the world That was at once brilliant with memory And still so dissonant with cruelty.

      Worry is a hamster wheel.   Round and round and round it goes, squeaking all the while, as we leap breathlessly to the next rung, accomplishing so much of nothing.   Like a drug, it penetrates our mind and soon the molehills are mountains, the sky is the sea, and drops of rain are transformed from tears of joy to tears of pain.

      After a late start out of Edison, NJ, and a tiring luggage haul through Penn Station, I finally settled in a comfortable car headed north through Poughkeepsie and into Hudson.  We followed the Hudson River the entire trip, with its snake-like windings glistening in the midday sun, and I was surprised at how enchanting its veiled banks are.  My experience with her was limited to glimpses from the highway in Albany and a solitary panorama from the Rip Van Winkle Bridge just outside of Catskill.   Following her up from Manhattan, however, introduced me to the quaint river I had not before known.  We moved quickly from urban to suburban, and then about twenty miles along, great heaping mounds of forested hill sprung up and gave the river a wildness that New York City has stolen from the harbor.   Up toward Rhinecilff the train sped up, but the scenery slowed down.  Two herons gossiping in a swampy sidenote heard the train and showed their great wings.  The rushes and swamp grasses are more populace further north, with the appearance of a few disinterested islands to hide them.  About ten minutes from the Hudson depot, a small cottage, sitting a piece of island almost as small and looking much like an abandon lighthouse, stood guard of the sleeping giants.  These mountains are less juvenile, more Catskill; no abrupt knobs or drops.  They are softer but more potential; less unpredictable and more certain.   Ah - Van Winkle.  The bridge I have only known from above - tall and slender, stately and grand, grasping both shores as if to pull the earth together in some Herculean stunt.  This perspective is much more overwhelming - much like life - greater, different, but ultimately truth.  What is a bridge until you have explored its underbelly?  What is it until you've seen that which keeps it standing?

      Leaps and bounds over emerald hillsides, Drinking summertime's wine; Oh the days of cerulean heavens, Up, up and alive; Strings are loosed - imagination wings away... Taste a cloud - and savor it another day...   Like a word that is whispered upon the breeze, Free, innocent child; Swept away from the halcyon yesterdays To a world without smile; Peace is gone - tomorrow haunts us as we dream... Self-made man - imprisoned by the things that seem...   Unsure and afraid in this temple of clay, As shackles of frailty bind; Great master of hillsides and all that's to come, I beg You renew my mind;   God of Creation - Possesor of Omnipotence; This hesitation I relinquish to Your Imminence; And I'm coming again like a child To the God of Creation.

      The Journal, like a well-meant New Year's resolution, has been forgotten.  The writer is tired and his brain is stubborn.  The discipline he has demanded of his students is lacking in himself.  Sorting through, classifying, scrutinizing every thought and stray emotion is as disinteresting as it is difficult.  The Journal is to the mind what a usage book is to language; sometimes prescribing, sometimes describing, always chronicling.   He writes at times for need, at times duty; but it must ever be honest, unfeigned.  Truth may not always prevail, but only because this mutable man cannot always see truth.  But he can see what he can see, so it at very least must exist in observation.   The journal - a proving ground for thoughts.

      Why does it seem that life is so difficult?     A breath of fresh air today really is a breath of fresh air.  Nature - from my tainted vantage point - has still retained its simplicity and innocence.  The world of us still runs unthrottled around it, but the grass still dances in long October sunlight, the yellowjacked still plays at my feet, and the goslings still squabble and shake their tails.  And over the forgiving soil pours a warmth no electric heater can reproduce.   Yet we work ourselves into a vein-popping fury at the most insignificant things; and I daresay that even the significant things should be rethought.  I've found myslf blind with anger at traffic, pounding the steering wheel and shouting threats heard by none but myself.  What level of vanity finds me cursing at inanimate objects?   Fours months holed up in a dreary living room and I finally found the strength and unction to visit the park.  Here the air is clean and I can see the sky without glass obstructing the view.  You've got to touch the air, taste the breeze, swallow the sunshine before you can really be alive.  Step away from the steel and alabaster cages, pull the emerald blanket over your head and rest.

      I awoke one season in life to find that my feet were shackled together and my back was laden with a burden heavy beyond imagining.   My mind raced.  Why was I burdened and bound?  Why this load?  How long could I endure?  There must be some means of relief.  So in a feeble search for a solution, I set off; but as soon as I tried to move, the all-too-obvious answer presented itself.   I fell to my knees.   Oddly enough, my hands were bound together as well.

      The heavens cried, the teardrops fell     And spattered on the streets of hell. A smoky haze entombed the town,     Devoured souls without a sound. Each ghostly form, devoid of life     Cut here and there - a piercing knife Now thrust into a weeping form     As sorrow haunts him, black and warm; And never-spoken fears arrest the soul.   Undying pain with all its death     Beleaguers him with every breath Of hopeless air; more hopeless still     The children by the windowsill Who spend their days in ashen heaps     'Till evening comes and body sleeps. And death without but punctuates     The shadows moving through the gates In silent ranks, attending to this end:   "Defeat! Despair!" the mourners wail     And fling their cries into the gale. (The tempest on the sea of death     Spoke terribly with every breath) The breath - that breath that from them pours,     Like foul stench from Hades' shores, Defiled every decent thing     And made the raven pause to sing Of death and of mortality's decay.   The shadow gone, the rage subsides;     But deep within the soul abides That nameless fear of death and hell-     That fear for which the teardrops fell. Immortal though this coil seems,     The truth is more than shapeless dreams And will reveal eternal worth     As this Transition moves us forth Into the life beyond this life we know.

      Like a child standing, gazing      At the verigated flames As they lick their pyre-tongue,     Play their deadly pyre-games.   Inner-person smothered     Underneath the rosy blaze; The mind at rest in ashes     With the eyes a distant glaze.   Awake, you inner-vagrant,     Recognize your living claim; Life consists of so much more     Than just hiding in the flames.

      A new leaf or an old leaf, they are all leaves; and as leaves in their due time they will curl at the edges and fall into great piles that will in turn give themselves over to the dust and the only memory of their existence will be the dark earthy scent that lingers on their autumn air.  But oh the thrill of their blossom, the shade of their fullness and the sad beauty of their passing!

      Down the corridor of time Into the spacious halls of rhyme Where waits the morning's golden glow And sunlight pauses here as though The binding spell, now mystery, Will soon recapture history.   A landscape on the farther wall-- The treasure of this aging hall-- Invites my dreams to visit hence, To leap across the golden fence And run headlong through grassy fields To taste the fruit its orchard yields.   The stifled air within this room Cannot contain the daisy's bloom, Nor can hollow paneled walls Give freedom to the eagle's calls; But I am there and sight is blind As I meander with the mind.

      I thrust my hands to the heavens to embrace God and all that He has for me, but I must not lose sight of those in need around me.  It is very easy to reach for someone who cannot be touched with these hands; the real test is reaching out to those who can be touched, nurtured affected.  Loving God without loving men is like setting vague goals and not taking the steps to attain them.  Our love for God is subject to our love for others; Jesus Himself placed the qualifier!

      Well, in an unexpected turn I found internet access in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains, but only for a few moments, so here is a basic rundown of my week so far.  I drove all day Saturday through Pennsylvania and Virginia and watched the sun set dusty rose on the Shenendoah Valley.  I entered Charlotte, North Carolina around 10pm and saw the quarter moon rippling over the water.  The house where I'm staying is on the very summit of one of the Blue Ridge Mountains and I woke up this morning to the sun streaming across the mountains and flooding the bedroom.  The drive up was frightening, but well worth the view.  Time to run, but I'll try to fill in everyone in a few days!

      These are no magic numbers.  I will wake up in the morning as every other day, inhale and pull the covers back.  I will step from my bed and feel the soft, warm carpet on my naked feet.  The sun will be somewhere overhead and the birches in my front lawn will still touch the sky.  The snow may have melted and the mail might be late, but it will still be a day on this earth.  And yet as the second hand sweeps across the face of time, it hammers into my head the fact that my life is quickly changing, moving, shifting, disappearing like a child's breath on a cold morning.  We lounge around the living room in our pajamas, mussed hair and spent wrapping paper, each one a bit wiser, a bit older, a bit more sore and a bit more foolish.  We laugh and play and forget about the first eleven months of the year, bewitched by woodsmoke and frying bacon until all at once we catch a glimpse of something we hadn't seen or had simply ignored before.  With a laugh, a twinkle, a nod of the head or a raised coffee cup the soul surfaces and like a pleasant aroma we draw it in deeply and close our eyes, wishing it would last forever, knowing it will soon be gone, making a memory for the dark days, the Mondays, the frightening days, the days we forget the truth.  But for now the eyes are open and the laughter abides.

      Leaning up against the Jeep, I craned my neck back as far as I could to see Saturday night's meteor shower and tugged my scarf closer to my neck.  Since this was my first show, I looked up in anticipation of galactic fireworks and every other imagination science fiction can provide.  Real life, as is usually the case, was far less glamorous than my childhood fancies, and with two streaks of light it was over.    Much like the greatly-hailed weekend Nor’easter that was supposed to bring all the white fury that winter could muster and leave us buried beneath three feet of snow.  The weathermen were “crying ruin like a town crier in Pompeii” and teacher and students alike spent longer in prayer on Sunday morning thanking God for grace and snow days.  Noon struck and we scattered from church through the ever-increasing flurries and raced home excited at the thought of being trapped alive in our suburban caverns (with far too much enthusiasm for winter roads).    But we watched out the window as the blizzard subsided and by nightfall teachers were wary, snowplows were idling and the ground was only dusted with snow.  Children made sure to say their prayers this night.  And somehow, despite the mere frosting, everyone awoke to find school cancelled.  That and a dictator’s haggard picture on the morning news.  Someone must have wished upon one of those stars.

      Here is an excerpt from a larger piece I'm working on.  Comments are more than welcome!  Dark plumes of charcoal smoke spiraled upward into the midnight sky.  A vague moon blistered and wavered above the dances of flames on the roof of the one-room cabin.  A small form stood silhouetted against the orange blaze, stood motionless, stood quietly.  Tender planks of pine hissed and popped as the rage consumed the walls until at last the roof fell in on itself, sending a shower of sparks upwards.  The boys orange face was devoid of emotion while the shadow danced and played on his features.  Like a vacuum the emptiness existed in his sunken eyes and he stared into the glowing fury, into the swirling madness, watching the thousands of faces screaming with the whistles of escaping steam.

      Like yesterday's soup the rain came down not cold, but cool, turning the fluffy powder into deceptive bowls of slush that leapt at every pant leg and dry sock.  Morning never actually came; night had its eerie grip on the entire day, penciling everything with monochromes.  Even sleep tugged at my limbs and lids much of the afternoon until finally I couldn't take it any longer; I ran into my room, pulled the curtains shut and hid in the den of my room to look at pictures of sunshine and deserts.  Maybe morning decided to show up late in the day.  I don't know; I didn't dare look out.

      It seems like this week more than any in a long while I have been inundated with people who say one thing and live another.  I have students who say they believe in and worship God but give no visible indication to the reality of those claims.  I hear people speak their religion as if it were a popular sitcom... have to tune in each week to see what happens next, even though in all reality it could go away and life would continue.  People are satisfied with a disposable faith because it is SAFE.  If someone begins to question, the casual believer can step back into the shadows and easily sever all ties with God, appearing normal and nonthreatening.  To truly taste of His goodness, we must step forward into the danger zone and appear fanatical and (heaven forbid) trusting.  What person finds a cure for cancer and quietly pours it out into the dirt?  Anything important in life is worth getting excited about, and anything worth getting excited about will require either supreme effort or supreme grace.  Interestingly enough, we have been given a taste of both.

      Had this strange dream last night that I was on the steps of the Supreme Court building and this gigantic pig walked up on his hind legs and began to harass my two friends.  I could only take it so long.  I leapt onto his back and began to wrestle with him, all the while shouting derogatory pig terms like "slab of meat" and "pork rind".  I even pulled a Tyson and bit his ear, but he didn't flinch.  It finally came to it and I heaved him over my head and down the stairs, but he squealed and laughed till he landed on the sidewalk and I realized that this was no way to settle a dispute.  I called down to him and asked him if he wanted to debate political views with me on a national talk radio program...

      Alright... I spent more time than I wanted on this site update, but at least it's done.  I removed the educational links that didn't work (adding some jazzy buttons I might add), updated the quote (which is quite brilliant) and put a link to this blog on the main page.  I did a few other things, but you probably wouldn't notice.  I also put all of my old Jars on my blog so you can browse through the archives without as much hassle as you were getting before.  Hopefully you enjoy it, because it's so much easier to update.  This Christmas break, I'd like to get things up and running with a new look and feel to the website.  I mean really, how many times can you look at pictures I designed when I was 16?

Now the sneaking eyes are not the only ones to read my rants; now the world can look on in horror.  Welcome to the future - an emotional nudist streaking down the information superhighway!  Forgive me for the major rubbernecking.  According to the rules of writers, about 75% of what is written (32 words in this post) is worthy of being mashed to pulp and turned to dinner napkins.

      After Noah's flood (which has been recorded in various ways in other sources such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh), God commanded those who survived to "be fruitful and multiply" and "bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein." (Gen. 9:7) Mankind then proceeded to move south east from Mount Arrarat where the ark landed (believed to be on the border of Turkey and Iraq) and settled between the Tigris and Euphrates river in the plains of Shinar (modern day southern Iraq) where Mesopotamia and the Sumerian civilization had it beginnings.  It was here that Babylon had its foundations. After the flood the weather patterns varied greatly and one man named Nimrod (a grandson of Ham, Noah's son: Genesis 10:9-10) most likely saw this as an opportunity to control people. The Bible says that he was a mighty hunter and that his kingdom began in Babel. Many believe (from inscriptions found in Bablyon) that he was actually a hunter of men, the first to institute slavery (as a means to build this tower of Babel recorded in scripture). So he used these new, unknown weather patterns (thunderstorms, hurricanes, etc.) to validate his "divine" power (like the eclipse in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court).  In the midst of this, God saw both the pride of man's heart and (most likely) the corruption of Nimrod's regime and "confounded" or mixed up the languages. Family groups kept the same language, but seperated from other family groups. Most of Japeth's grandson's settled western Asia, Europe, England (and eventually America) and his family line was characterized by light skin. Shem's son's, olive-skinned, stayed mostly in the middle east - Israel and Arab nations all fall under this lineage. As a matter of fact, Shem's great grandson was Eber, from which we get the "Hebrew" people. (Gen. 11:10-14) Ham's sons, much darker skinned, settled much of Africa and part of the Mediterranian coast (as a matter of fact, Gen. 10:6 says that one of Ham's sons was named Phut... study Egyptian history and you'll see this name often).  On an EXTREMELY interesting sidenote, many Christians (even recently) pointed to Genesis 9:25 as a verse supporting slavery. Some preachers claimed that God had cursed Ham's son and so "black people" were cursed in God's sight as servants. True, Canaan was cursed for looking longingly at his grandfather Noah naked. But even an elementary survey of the Old Testament makes it clear that Canaanites settled the Mediteranian Coast and their punishment was meted out to them when Israel came into Canaan (or the "Promised Land") after the Exodus from Egypt. As a matter of fact, Canaan's first-born son was named Sidon (Gen.10:15), the name of one of the Mediterranean's most important seaports. One of Ham's great grandson's was named Philistim, from which we get Philistines... the nationality of the infamous giant Goliath. The curse though was not extended to all of Ham's sons, just Canaan, so that argument is completely ignorant.  Back to Nimrod. Everyone is still together in Shinar (modern day southern Iraq) building this tower of Babel. Nimrod proclaims himself and his wife Zarpanitu a god, supporting that assertion with the new weather patterns. He predicts that when he dies he will be reincarnated in his "virgin" wife's belly as a god-child. He dies, she gets pregnant (allegedly with one of the soldiers) and she gives birth to Marduk (or Murdoch), the self-proclaimed god-child. As a matter of fact, the map of Babylon that I linked to earlier actually shows a Marduk gate and a place where they found the inscription: "the gods pay heed to marduk".  Now there is a god-mother and god-child that gets worshipped in this Babylonian religious system. This pagan idea is passed along down through the ages, showing itself in many other belief systems. During the Bronze Ages in Canaan, Baal is worshipped as his son Baalim alongside the god-wife/mother Asteroth. In Egypt, Osiris is rejuvenated in his son Horus and is worshipped with this god-wife/mother Isis. In the middle ages, Mary is often worshipped as the god-mother and Christ the god-son. They all have fingerprints of a religious system established more than 5,000 years ago.  Archaelogical research in Iraq (done before the Iraqi/Kuwait conflict in the 90's) has turned up some interesting findings (although a definite conflict of interest must be admitted) - a 90 meter square foundation (now submerged) believed by many to be the site of this tower. The map of Babylon that I linked to earlier actually shows a Marduk gate and a place where they found the inscription: "the gods pay heed to marduk". Herodotus gives us a description of the tower in the 5th century B.C. and there is indication that Alexander the Great tore it down in the 4th century B.C. (in hopes of refurbishing and rebuilding it).

      The thundering waves are calling me home to you The pounding sea is calling me home to you  On a dark new year's night  On the west coast of Clare I heard your voice singing Your eyes danced the song Your hands played the tune T'was a vision before me.  We left the music behind and the dance carried on As we stole away to the seashore We smelt the brine, felt the wind in our hair  And with sadness you paused.  Suddenly I knew that you'd have to go My world was not yours, your eyes told me so Yet it was there I felt the crossroads of time And I wondered why.  As we cast our gaze on the tumbling sea A vision came o'er me Of thundering hooves and beating wings In clouds above.  As you turned to go I heard you call my name, You were like a bird in a cage spreading its wings to fly "The old ways are lost," you sang as you flew And I wondered why.

       Why the English language is difficult to learn:    Reprinted from Reader's Digest Magazine:   The bandage was wound around the wound. He could lead if he would get the lead out. The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert. When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes. The insurance was invalid for the invalid. The were too close to the door to close it.

      I want to believe in God.  Believing in God would give life meaning and purpose beyond this transient life.  A higher authority means someone to answer to, someone to turn to  for  the answers, someone with a greater plan.  God--a divine conductor for this orchestra we call life.  But He does not make it easy.  The mustard seed is small, common; when it comes time to exercise faith, however, I'm on my knees scrounging and scrambling for it.  Some righteous actions are blessed, others seemingly punished and I'm left to a guessing game with eternal stakes.  I look at it this way... my skepticism is either a slowly-sipped poison that is eating away at my faith from the inside-out, or it is the tiny, unreachable window in my prison cell, the one I can look out and see the world, but cannot obtain it.  If it is the poison, I need to drop the chalice; if it is the window, then I am damned to knowing, even in the smallest way, that there is something more and I can only know it and never experience it fully, I can only wander this cross section of the vast landscape with my eyes, never setting foot on anything but this cold and stony cell.  And to think it all comes down to a mustard seed.

      The rain continued well into the night, and I laid in bed and watched it spatter against the window in smeared orange until the solitary streetlight shut off and left me with gray distorted shapes.  Slowly the light grew brighter again and with barely audible click shut off again.  I counted this cycle thirty one times and on the thirty second click the phone rang in the other room and made me jump.  Any time the phone rang this late, there was trouble.  Last time Lorraine called for dad because her stepfather was drunk and had thrown one of her patio chairs through the parlor window.  Dad had brought his gun, but didn't need it.  I strained to hear what was being said.  I heard mom shout something like she was crying; then I heard dad's voice briefly.  Something about an accident, about Jack's wife, about the rain, a telephone pole.  "David, I need you to take me to the emergency room.  Mom's in no condition to drive."  I hung up numb, the light clicked off, and I was left alone in darkness to imagine the worst.

      His broken harmonica bantered on and on beneath rotting yellow teeth, calling out the evergreen heart, spruced and misled, tapering off until the rhino with his ponderous steps bellows and the measuring tape whips back into place.  A mouthful of sand and cranberry and then in a blinking white splintering moment, the belly is shorn and the ashen silhouettes play in the long shadowed eve of the world.  Thunder, thunder, then lightning.  The tongue tip slit in the spit-chiseled candy cane grooves with a drop of Mars on the brink, the bluff, the drink, the scuff, the stuff of husky ladies.  They pound the pavement and shake the stars, kick their combat boots across the mountains and swallow the moon for supper.  A snap of the marker, and thus it begins - a comedy for the common man, an epic for the epicurean, a mystery for those whose brains are vaulted, lock and key.  And if you put it in your mouth, it tastes like wax and backyard sunsets on the grill.

      My stomach was in frenzy and my dead hands and feet struggled to keep me standing.  Sobriety and anger mingled in an intoxicating mixture that had me running madly through the silent crowd, knocking people aside looking for something true.    "God!"  I called out in desperation.  "You must believe."  I turned to see an elderly man in a hospital gown.  "God?"  I called out in fear, running from the man.  "You must believe."  A thin, pale-faced woman touched my shoulder.  " God!!! "  I cried out in anger.  "You must believe."  I looked down and saw the boy, his eyes no longer pleading for an answer, now only pleading for my soul.  How could they not see?  How could they continue to hold this mindless belief even after it had been proven false?  They were so programmed in life that even death could not shake this belief.  I cursed, partly at their foolishness in death, partly at my naivete in life; and, with a gun I snatched from the floor, I fired two shots into the air.  A thousand faces turned to me and I shouted with all my strength:  "Do you not see?  Do you not understand?"  My chest was heaving and I felt larger than anyone else there.  "I did believe and look where it brought me.  Look where it's brought  you! "  Each person in the crowd turned slowly to face his neighbor - there was a long, silent pause.    Then in unison, they turned to me and chanted, "You must believe."  I could not take this any longer.  In blind rage, I shouted and fired the third shot.  Before I could close my mouth or breathe, a mighty rushing win swept through the warehouse and the echoes of the gunshot grew louder and greater until in a flash of white light my vision was gone and a deep, majestic and awesome voice rang out this anthem:  "To those with faith, He reveals Himself."  Every nerve in my body stung and the wind continued to move me upward and out until in another strobe of light I was standing in complete silence, looking through a simple window into the most blessed peaceful scene my mind had ever been given.  Truth - I know now He is real.  I pressed my hands and face to the glass to feel the warmth, to feel the truth, to steady myself.  It had all been true; the world was upside down and faith was the reality.  I had in fact chosen my own end.  Grasping and clawing I fell toward the swirling black and orange.  Then Hell.  * * * * *   (Part 3 of 3)

      It was either an instant or one hundred years, but I knew I had not survived the fall.  Actually, it must have been one hundred years because all of that seemed so far away and insignificant now.  The most important thing right now was the pressure on the soles of my feet.  That, and the cinder block tunnel we were moving down.  I say we - I'm not sure when I was aware of it, but the children stood beside me.  The woman did not.  As the eye sees more with each step of the sun over the mountains, so I began to understand, contemplate, remember with each passing moment.  The light in our descending platform grew brighter and curiosity began its slow transformation.  Cinder blocks?  My old thoughts of heaven came rushing back, the carefully crafted thoughts of diamond-glistening roadways winding through emerald dales hedged in by dizzying golden spires that pierced up through the clouds; and here I was in my blood soaked shirt and jeans watching cinder blocks slide past.  We moved for such a long time that my hope began to fade; it leapt again when the platform clanged, halted and jerked to a stop.  My back was to a great light, but the children had my hands and they were gasping and pointing.  I turned slowly, eyes closed, afraid of having my hopes dashed, even more afraid perhaps of having them fulfilled.  I opened my eyes to a bright white gate, only able to make out dark figures moving around as though they were swallowed up in the midst of an ivory sea.  As the children pulled me through the gate, though, I was immediately struck deeply with confusion and despair.  We emerged in what appeared to be an enormous warehouse, filled with thousands of other people, confusion on their faces.  Old vending machines, rusted car parts, lawn ornaments, antique weapons and other unidentifiable metal pieces lay strewn about the concrete floor and some of the children were digging through the piles.  As my two ran over without hesitation and began constructing imaginary houses, the dawn of my mind shed its brightest light and I realized numbly that I was those children, rummaging through reality, constructing my own heaven, my own God, in the hope that I could after all control my own end.  It had all been a game, a wager, a grasping and clawing as we fell, all of us, toward the swirling black and orange.  Then rage.  * * * * *   (Part 2 of 3)

       The following is an extremely vivid dream I had this week.  I woke in fright and after much consideration, I think the theme of this is 'genuine faith'.  There are three parts:   The wind whipped around the four of us as if it too wanted us dead.  Gunshots popped nearby and with each one the children in my arms winced and cried out.  In a few moments they would be upon us and would do God only knows what to myself and the children; but the woman quivering beside me had been one of them.  They would be especially cruel to her. Like deer we had been driven higher and higher through the woods until we came at last to the bluff.  I told them all that things would be fine, and this was a lie.  Looking down at the flaming houses and thickening smoke below, I realized just how ridiculous the lie was.  Somewhere in all of these desperate thoughts I was brought back to my last day on earth by the pleading eyes of the boy.  He did not say anything; he just tugged my shirt and with his eyes asked every question I had no answer for.  I had nothing to hope.  Then, emerging from my doubt like a messenger bursting through the crowd, my faith came back to me.  I bowed my head, fell to my knees and sobbed.  All three of them were staring at me; I could feel their wondering eyes.  “We have nothing to fear.”  I sat back and faced them.  “They cannot touch our destiny.”  I could sense relief in the children, but the woman still looked fearfully to the woods.  “Yes, you too.  They have your past.”  I gestured toward the trees.  “But they cannot touch-”  From the thicket a man leapt with a shout of gibberish and a flourish of his weapon.  He laughed violently and fired into the air.  As he did, all time seemed to slow.  His eyes connected mine; they were so fierce and full of rage and I could not look away so I pushed back toward the ridge.  Slowly, unavoidably he lowered his gun and aimed it directly at the woman’s belly.  The wind pushed her black hair into her face.  We all screamed but our mouths only opened, and the sound of the gunshot echoed off my tongue.  I fell back from the present ruin and saw only devastation below.  Turning from the hellish landscape to a gun barrel in my temple, I closed my eyes for death and then it was gone.  The world was upside down for a moment.  I thought he had shot me, but I saw the woman and children tumbling in the air beside me and this time I could hear them screaming.  My stomach was in frenzy and my dead hands and feet clawed out for anything as the swirling back and orange rushed at us.  Then darkness.  *  *  *  *  *   (Part 1 of 3)

      I saw  The Passion of The Christ  tonight, and I am very tired.  I will only write a little, because I need to let it sink in.  I suppose everyones reaction will be different.  I went with my parents and they were fairly straight-faced.  My brother and sister-in-law were somber and my sister was amazed.  If you don't really know Jesus or believe in who He was and what He stood for, the movie is just a Braveheart-esque movie with violence to boot.  But I just got done watching my Savior give His life for me.  I cried, but they were the first involuntary tears I've shed in a while.  I did not know I was crying until they touched my chin.  In Simon's betrayal I saw myself, cursing God as I've done often enough before.  And as he was being scourged, I literally sobbed because...  ...well, maybe this is to personal to share, because not everyone will understand; but I felt like so much of what I fight over and complain about means NOTHING in light of Jesus.  This was not a Shayamalan plot twister; nor was it a Woo action film.  But it did for my view of Christ what Saving Private Ryan did for my view of war.  Sobering.  Compelling.  Ultimately life-changing.  I watched some guys get up, laugh and bang elbows as they were walking out.  They probably didn't see the movie I saw.  In the final scene, Mary was looking at ME...

      Much hoopla has been made over Mel Gibson's cinematic account of the last twelve hours of Christ's life.  Some say that it is a brutal feast of gore; others call it a controversy-induced money-maker.  But the most vitriolic of these labels is as old as the gospels themselves: anti-Semitic.  The Boston Globe, in an attempt at creative journalism, attaches a more potent tag to the same basic unease.  The movie’s fidelity to the original texts gives liberal Catholic columnist James Carroll little comfort because in his eyes, the Gospels are permeated with “the virus of Jew hatred.”  The Jews, critics say, are constantly and wrongfully in the crosshairs and even a faithful telling of Christ’s death “can do damage.”  Well, the heads will talk as they always do, but let the accused speak.  In Acts 4:26-27, John and Peter (the pinnacle of Catholic ancestor-worship) clearly indicates the culpable parties:  “The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together.”  I suppose then it makes sense that “there is not a scintilla of anti-Semitism to be found anywhere in this powerful film.”  After all, the Jews  did  crucify Jesus… along with every other human being in history, myself included.

      For being a large, multibillion-dollar network, CBS seems to have made quite a few mistakes lately.   Number Ones ,  urlLink a prime-time collection of Michael Jackson's , was scheduled to run in November, but got rescheduled after his child molestation case broke.   Oops .  Then CBS executives gave the greenlight to a Ronald Reagan bio piece (that it now calls "fictitious") until enough people shouted for its removal and  urlLink CBS backstepped .   Oops .  And who could forget the  urlLink costume malfunction of all costume malfunctions  during the Superbowl Halftime show.    Major oops  .  If a man has an affair with his wife, he can say that he is sorry; but trust is lost.  If it happens again, more trust is lost and the apology seems less genuine.  Three times?  Any ladies sticking around for strike four?    Sorry CBS - I think its over between you and me.

      This is a test.  Of what I'm not sure.  I logged in and now here sit, facing what some people dread - a blank page.  The fear might be like what someone once said to me about children; its frightening, because think of how much you can mess up.  I suppose all of this white space could be seen as a chance to make a mistake; but greater still the opportunity for success!  There have been many words written, printed, etched and carved, and each one was someone's attempt to communicate SOMETHING.  How to cope with death, how to discipline your children, how to get the toothpaste out.  Anger, stupidity, love, lust, lies and every other thing imaginable.  I could look at all this white like some literary blizzard in which I'll get swallowed up never to return.  But spring has arrived.  I don't think the white space will last long.

      Going to watch  The Day After Tomorrow  and expecting to be educated is like going to Disney World for a lesson in Advanced English Grammar.  You don't go there to engage your brain.  You go to have a good time.  And it was, in theory, a good time; despite the fact my disbelief was suspended a bit too far and despite the fact the director was ambitious enough to hope I would walk out of a movie where more than half the earth's population is killed feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.  I mean, how much can one hope for when at the end of 2 hours, the nation is destroyed and the hope for mankind's future lies with third world countries?  What kind of movie preaches against global warming and closes the curtain with a glorious shot of Mexico City (that bastion of environmentalism)?  Need I mention the wolves?  Three-fourths of the way through the movie, as if the world being destroyed by every natural disaster known to man isn't climactic enough, the producers throw in a pack of "ravenous" wolves (which are an awkward blend of velociraptor and Stooge) to "add to the drama."  What if the giant twisters wrecking L.A. weren't enough?  "Yes Mr. President, California has just slipped into the ocean and Manhattan was just demolished by a tsunami; but sir - your insulin medicine has run out!!!"  All in all, it was fun and there were plenty of ooh and ahh moments, but I did notice my rear going numb several times, and that's never a good sign.

        Chapter 2: Geraniums and Such    "I was given charge of your well-being, and your interests are best served in my care."  Or so it was proclaimed and thereby believed that Lady Elna spoke for me.  She had taken the liberty of talking to the judge about the whole thing; ultimately I was glad because I had frankly forgotten to, but I truly resented her stepping into this mess mom and dad left as if I were unable to cope.  Of course I can cope, I told the nurse.  She spared me a glance and a forced smile before losing herself again in my clipboard.  I felt like throwing my geranium at her - Elna, that is.  Once the house was sold she'd be off to Montego Bay or wherever her kind went to get away, and she'd probably even take the dog, although I was his favorite.  I suppose Elna thought of me as a worthless artist with no real opinion but what the liberals were feeding me.  How little she knew.  You don't make money writing!  And if it really was about the money, she bought ME the geranium!  I would have picked a dandelion, in all its Bradbureqsue style, swathed in denim for textures sake.  But in she came, facade gleaming and flowery words gushing, geranium in hand.  "You do realize these situations are particularly..."  She looked out the window.  "Precarious."  Politics as usual.  I should have been used to the mindless formalities, the social bureaucracy, but it still annoyed me like fork on plate.  She droned on and on about the crash, and before she was done I was asleep.  The nurse said she left the geranium and walked out around nine.  She arrived a quarter past eight, so she must've stayed a while after I slept.  Probably put whiskey in my I.V.  One of her groundskeepers told me that's how her last husband died.  It did feel a little warm in here.

      "For heavens sakes!" he shouted until his voice was hoarse and he couldn't say anything else.  Looking around at all of the people in the mall, he wondered if perhaps he should have waited until he was in the basement again before shouting out like this, but on second thought... what good would screaming in the basement do?  All those ticks and fleas nibbling at your neck was like the orphanage all over again.  Which is odd because he had never set foot in an orphanage.  You liar, he told himself.  Lying to yourself was one of those things that he absolutely hated and would never stop beating himself up over it.  You tell yourself one lie and before you know it, you can't even trust your own senses.  Run that hand across sandpaper and who knows what you'll feel.  It's betrayal of the highest sort; that and a late paycheck.  But his paychecks had all been on time the last few years with Tony working the payroll now.  He didn't like being messed with, and the checks always went out on time.  Bernard felt a bulge in the back pocket of his jeans.  The old leather wallet left a cigarette box shape worn into his jeans, so most people thought he smoked.  He didn't, he was cutting back.  But about those paychecks - every single one from January of last year to this past Thursdays had been folded neatly in thirds and tucked away.  He had not deposited them because he had no reason to.  Now he had a reason.  But the man at the counter really didn't understand that reason.  And Bernard really didn't like people misunderstanding him.  It was both irritating and rude.  Probably rude at first, and rude eventually became irritating.  And irritating made his neck itch.  So there he stood, looking like a New Englander on a Florida beach--neck red, irritated and wholly without an engagement ring.  "I want this one with the large bluish stone!" he shouted a little louder than was necessary, but loud enough to get his frustration across.  The poor teenage clerk with terrible acne went on and on about the same thing he had just been saying earlier.  Card declined.  Insufficient funds.  Payment plans.  I'm not sure this is working Bernard.  Maybe you need something different in a woman.  He laughed a very sarcastic laugh.  The clerk looked at him.  "I'm sorry, go on."

      I have not cried in months.   What I cannot understand about us is that we see childhood as a pitiful moment that will dry up and blow away not a moment too soon.&nbsp; When heaven is so full of innocence, our children are yearning, reaching, scheming for an adulthood wracked with guilt and pain.&nbsp; To a child, every tree, every house, every taste, every smell is new and wonderful and even fear itself is a stranger, calmly met with inquisitive minds.&nbsp; Untouched (unspoiled) attitudes embrace every stage and every script with gusto, as if it were both their first and last.   Yet each child, each smiling face, will fight the good fight of faith and will one day stop, look back and realize that they have not cried in months.

      Jessica and I went with about fifteen other people from Grace Bible Fellowship in Redhook, NY to evangelize to a migrant camp of about fifty Spanish workers at a nearby farm.&nbsp; Before hand we prayed for our trip and were a trifle apprehensive because no one had a solid plan.&nbsp; The idea was simply to walk around, share the gospel (as best as we could) and let the Spirit lead.&nbsp; I had brought my guitar, so I sat in the dining room (which consisted of four picnic tables in a concrete block room with a drain in the floor) and played the few Spanish songs I knew and then some from a sheet Pastor Cirone had given me. &nbsp; It turned out to be one of the best nights I've had in a while.&nbsp; I met Caesar - a 17 year old boy whose father and mother were associate pastors at a church in Texas.&nbsp; He really didn't want anything to do with God or the Bible, and I assume that's because he feels like its been crammed down his throat all his life.&nbsp; I just but the decision in his hands and let God work away. &nbsp; We're hoping to go again this coming Friday - I'll fill you in on how things go!

      Just hopping around this thing called 'Net and I came across a pleasant aroma of creativity and intelligence and thought I'd pass it along to my cultured readers.  It's not the prettiest website on the I.S., but you'll pardon the mess once you get to reading:    urlLink Classical Newbie    also check out her weblog:    urlLink The Journey    Renee Doirion, the creator of these literary nibblets, and I went to PCC together, but as I recall we were merely acquantainces... a real shame, because after reading some of her works, I would like to have gone back and forth in discussion on the VC Terrace (during social hours, of course) about a good number of things.  It would have been fun.  All nosalgia aside, check it out.  I particularly enjoyed her  urlLink Villanelle  as well as  urlLink Reaction .

       urlLink    I rushed into my house one evening (running late of course) to get packed for our camping trip, and caught myself breathless at the sight of this bouquet. The evening sun sent such an intense light that set these roses ablaze. This has to be one of my favorite shots.

       urlLink    This amazingly rich barn sits beside Route 9 in Livingston, NY. As far as I know, it's not in use, but it sure does add to the atmosphere of the Hudson Valley. I touched it up a bit (the bottom left door and the windows have different effects than the siding). The velvety mocha siding speaks volumes and adds to the antique feel of the place.

       urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     Well, I've never been a sucker for sentimentality, but when my little nephew Gabriel came along, things changed drastically. I've posted some of the photos of his very first camping trip. Gosh. Every time I look at him I think he's the cutest thing on earth... Sad part about it all is that in a week my brother and his wife will be moving from Kentucky, which is no small jaunt from NY. At least I got a chance to spend time with him this first year. I hope he doesn't forget about his Unca' Jesse!

      Came across a  urlLink blog post concerning the Nick Berg beheading video  and snatched this little "gem" of a quote from it.   QUOTE: "Fanatic fundamentalism in any form is bad, mmm'kayyy?"   My response:    "So you're saying that nothing on this earth is worth dying for. Our soldiers are fanatic fundamentalists... fighting for the fundamental principles of freedom, liberty, etc. American Revolutionaries were fighting for the fundamental principles of freedom, liberty, etc. I think what you're saying is that you just don't think what they consider worthy of dying for is what you consider worthy of dying for.   And it's ironic because you're appalled at this beheading because you've been raised with the Judeo-Christian ethic of "thou shalt not kill". There have been times and places where this is considered appropriate behavior. Just not here in clean, sterile, pick-a-daisy USA.   Imagine that. Living in an age where the only appropriate behavior is believing strongly in nothing, where mediocrity is the banner-cry of the civilized."   See the issue with Nick Berg is not Muslims doing horrible things to promote their faith. To them, this was a completely justifiable act in the name of Allah. At the base of this gory expression of zeal is a misplaced trust, a unfounded belief that Allah will reward their militant service for the Islamic religion. The reason these men were wrong was not essentially because of the means they used to accomplish an end, but the end itself. The end is almost always at the heart of the matter.  You may object, saying that a pragmatic would have a worthy end and questionable means, but I suggest that the end is wrapped up in the means. A woman who steals money from her company to help feed his family has more problems than just a hungry family. A man who throws his child down the stairs for talking back has greater problems than a rebellious child. Christians who slaughtered during the time of the Crusades might have done so with a noble end, but certainly not in a way condoned by Scripture. The end is never distinct from the means of obtaining that end, and those who say otherwise have an impure goal in mind.  So how do we address radical fundamentalism? Embrace it. Know the truth about love and holiness and be fanatical about it. This is the only way to be truly free. None of this pandering mediocrity meant to keep everyone comfortable.  (Some of you are afraid of what this post implies, but rest assured that it is because you do not know the truth about love and holiness.)

       	 		 		 Found this old railroad bridge tucked away in the woods of lower Chatham.  I don't think it's in service anymore, but it does carry with it quite a bit of character.  I did a lomo effect ex post facto, which I think really works with the composition of the shot. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink S2400102 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink PlasticMind .
