       Around the corner I have a friend,   In this great city that has no end,   Yet the days goes by and weeks rushes on,   And before I know it, a year is gone.      And I never see my old friends face,   For life is a swift and terrible race,   He knows I like him just as well,   As in the days when I rang his bell.     And he rang mine but we were younger then,   And now we are busy, tired men.   Tired of playing a foolish game,   Tired of trying to make a name.      "Tomorrow" I say! "I will call on Jim   Just to show that I'm thinking of him."   But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes,   And distance between us grows and grows.      Around the corner, yet miles away,   "Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today."   And that's what we get and deserve in the end.   Around the corner, a vanished friend.     so pal out there..when u love someone..tell them dun keep it inside or you will end up in regret..see ya ard bye!!~

      my hazel brown tinted eyes watching every move u make. and that feeling of doubt, it's erased. i'll never feel alone again with you by my side. you're the one, and in you i confide.  i give my heart to you. Like a treasure not meant to be lose, I entrust my whole life to u, COz nothing matters more than me being with u.  living through today has made me realize,life has its ups and down, Have u ever guess wat is inside my mind, Coz u never know the feeling of mine,Lina...
