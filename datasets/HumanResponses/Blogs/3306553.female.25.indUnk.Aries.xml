      Blog is to Livejournal like Myspace is to Friendster. One may be more convenient, but everyone is on the other. Not only is Eagle Eye Ebrahimi clearly a nerd for doing this at all, but she is also very fickle (even in the digital world). One of these days Eye will get fired for doing this shit at work. For now, this journal has permanently moved  urlLink here .

      Bare with me in this testing phase and go  urlLink here  for now. I'm truly sorry for this confusion; I will make it up to you. Really.  P.S. Let me know what you like better: LJ or Blogger...

      Friends, this is just a test. JUST A TEST, don't worry. After much contemplation, I am looking into livejournal as an alternative to blog. (My what a postmodern age we live in, to have such strange choices!) Just for a week or so, I am going to see how livejournal is and perhaps I will switch. Until then, I will try my best to post on both until I get with it.  urlLink This  is where my livejournal is.

      Dear readers, Eagle Eye Ebrahimi offers humble apology for being MIA on the previous day. It's true though: The Eye is also employed and work duties called. Her various clients are idiots in all shapes and forms. "Sometimes I feel like a high-level babysitter," Eye was noted saying.     Friday, May 21   Today marks a momentous event: "Shags" Ebrahimi--14 years of age and much-younger sibling of Eye--will not only perform a thorough shaving of his pubescent facial hair, but he will also be accompanied by none other than older sister Eye to his first-ever show. Yes, that's right: In lieu of never having an older brother herself, Eye is extending the older-sibling olive-branch she always wanted for herself to her younger Megadeth-loving brother.  Ride the lightening young one!  Eye has even gotten him on the guest list and the young teenager is highly excited not to be dropped off at the venue by Mother E (quick interlude story: Shags goes to favorite skate shop on the Ave. and tells skate shop owner he has ridden the bus to get there; Mother E comes into store and says in very loud voice, "I've been waiting in the car too long, when are you going to be done?" Needless to say, Shags is mortified as only a 14-year old can be). Instead, Sister Eye will accompany him to the Vera Project, despite the fact she will probably be the only person over the age of 15 in the audience. Playing this fine night is The Catheters, The Lights, Akimbo and The Hunches.   After dropping off her brother, Eye will proceed on to The Comet where she will continue to bask in the glow of good sisterhood. "It's so great to be such a good person," Eye sighs.     Saturday, May 22   Eye really wants to watch  urlLink this  highly recommended movie.  Eye will probably get wine-drunk at a coworker's dinner party.  Then Eye will probably get drunker at friend Amanda's birthday party. Happy birthday Amanda!

      Right. So, thanks to  urlLink Kate  (who has only  just  moved back to town from San Fran a few days ago), I maybe-might-sorta drop in to see  urlLink DJ Spinna  tonight at... (somebody please put me out of my misery)  urlLink Chop Suey . Mr. Spinna has produced for artists such as Michael Jackson, De La Soul, Mary J. Blige, Mos Def, George Michael and the list goes on. But I guess what's really cool about his mixes is that he uses ample soul. Besides, it's free. (And that means I wouldn't have to feel bad if I left after like 10 minutes.)

      Don't get me wrong: I actually don't like going out that much. Really, my favorite thing to do is to sit back and deconstruct some fine reality television. So, tonight, in honor of a relaxing week, post-yoga will find me in front of the boob-tube. It's like being behind a one-way mirror at the psych. unit.   Speaking of one-way mirrors, there's that disgusting show  urlLink The Swan  that I can't help watching the same way one can't avert her eyes from a train wreck. Basically, they get a bunch of normal ladies with horrible self-esteems to agree to a total plastic-surgery makeover that is then documented via everyone's favorite exploiter Fox Television. They're not allowed to see how they "turned out" until the "unveiling" in which the TV audience gets to watch the plastic surgery victim gawk at their newfound looks for the first time in a one-way mirror. All the women are called "Ugly Ducklings" throughout the show and only half of them are selected to be part of this freak pageant in which the winner is named "The Swan."    And tonight is the premier of  urlLink Colonial House  too. Even Public Television has jumped on the reality TV boat, educational-style! This show is about a bunch of idiot families who sign up to live life the colonial way for five months.   If that's not enough to make you nauseous,  urlLink this  is coming too...  And, trust me, I'll be really upset for the next 48 hours because I lack cable, which means I can't see the  urlLink Three's Company  marathon on TV Land. I will always have a special place in my heart for the dynamic trio (I owe my mother's English skills to the Janet/Chrissy/Jack Tripper gang afterall). R.I.P. John Ritter! My mother shed tears for your death.

      Seattle, Wash--Late night Friday and following night Saturday, Eagle Eye Ebrahimi experienced "wooziness" due to excessive ingestion of red wine. "It happens sometimes," Eye was reported saying. "Buy me a drink and witness the phenomena yourself." Regardless of aforementioned symptom, Triple E still enjoyed herself.  Attending  urlLink "Frozen Moments"  at  urlLink ConWorks , Eye noted six pieces of art--everything from a film of a person cutting open stuffed animals augmented by a sitting area adorned with physical stuffing and battery-powered toy carcasses, to a giant dumpster converted into a room plastered with photographs, to firecrackers in various stages of explosion frozen in resin blocks. One unnamed attendee referred to the show as "masturbatory." Eye replied, "It's possible, attendee. It's possible. But I don't think it was  that  bad."   As for the  urlLink Capital Hill Arts Center , it's actually more of a Capital Hill Coffee and Drinks Center. After perusing the large high-school-dancish main room, the adjoining coffee shop and the seemingly disconnected downstairs bar, Eye stumbled upon a "gallery" not much larger than her own bedroom which held a paltry amount of art. "Is this really an arts center?" she pondered. The highlight of the evening consisted of the following: In the midst of poor  urlLink Anna Oxygen's  set, a young drunken woman crawled up onto the catwalk in front of the stage and began dancing in a very insinuating manner not unlike the movement of an exotic dancer's. As Oxygen attempted to interact with said female, the "skank" (as Eye will now refer to the female as, so as not to confuse dear readers into thinking the female was at all "attractive") began performing moves which consisted of her bending over to reveal the scandalizing fact that she was not wearing any panties beneath her mini skirt. "No wonder they need so much coffee and alcohol in this place," Eye said.  Meanwhile, last night found E.E.E. taking advantage of a local promotional sale at  urlLink Hollywood Video  (where, incidentally, all films are currently just $0.99 each). She viewed  urlLink Absolut Warhola,  a fairly good documentary about Pop Art artist Andy Warhol's previous cohort,  urlLink Stanislaw Mucha , traveling back to Warhol's Slovakian village roots and interviewing bumpkin relatives. And thus ended the Weekend of Contemporary Art. "Let it never happen again," Eye retorted. "Unless everyone is wearing the appropriate underwear. That's all I ask."

      The Mirabeau Room is swanky and you should go if you can. Their fries are really good too (Eye should know because Eye was the one in the corner being anti-social, ungracefully stuffing her face with them whilst alternately taking large gulps of her drink).   There's a solo dance in "Our Little Sunbeam" set to a song by  urlLink Kinski  that absolutely blew Triple E away. The fact that they were able to do ballet moves to music like Kinski and  urlLink Air  at all was impressive. But Eye was kind of disappointed there wasn't  more  dancing and less play-antics involving stuffed owls and spreadable ham. They're a dance company, right?  Editorial rant: Oh, and my second night back-to-back at the Chop? Man, I need to get a life. The door bouncer doesn't even have to look at my ID anymore for Godssake! All he has to do is say, "Oh, is that you Eagle? Eagle Eye, right? Yup, that's exactly what it says on your driver's license. Come on in." Anyway, the Lifesavas kicked ass and there was lots of dancing but it only depressed me because I was wearing the most horribly uncomfortable sling-back high-heels on the planet. I ask you, what the fuck did I do to deserve midget status at barely 5"2???

      So, I just got two free tickets to see dance company  urlLink 33 Fainting Spells'  opening night (tonight) at  urlLink On The Boards . It's the  urlLink hotly anticipated  world-premier of  urlLink "Our Little Sunbeam"  and the original music is done by Linas Phillips. There's a little pre-funk drinking soiree at 7ish with about 40 folks (various board members, etc.)  in a reserved room at the new  urlLink Mirabeau , the baby of Presidents of the United States and Maktub manager Dave Meinart (and he says they've installed smoke filters so you won't exit smelling like shit). My boss will be there so I must act proper. The performance starts at 8 and right afterward I'm high-tailing it to Chop Suey. Who wants to be my date? Email me.

      At one selected moment of the previous night, attending Revolver, Triple E was found to be inhaling a cig filter due to lighting it on the wrong end. Friends, this is exactly how out-of-it she was. "It's true; it happened," EEE admitted. Aside from finally meeting the beautiful  urlLink  Nikoel   in person (truly a momentous event), the night consisted of the usual sites (watching the regulars interact) and sounds (yelling at people next to you to be heard over the music). Gossip columnist  urlLink Kathleen Wilson  was also spotted hobbling around on a cane. The night's perils began circa 11 p.m. when Eye's desire to purchase a snack became unbearable. Alas, the hot-dog stand usually outside the Chop was nowhere in site and   just   as she approached the door of the pizza joint across the street, the asshole with the tattoos locked up and turned the key. As it was, Eye tolerated said scene for as long as possible before leaving mid- urlLink Lashes  for the night's real highlight: visiting Taco Bell. Even an Eagle can appreciate a 7-layer burrito.   Weekend is nearly here! (And that means doing all the same shit but not having to get up early the next morning and go to work.)    Friday, May 14   ConWorks' gala opening of their new exhibit starts at 8p.m. and goes till late, $7. "Frozen Moments" is all about "reconstructing memories," a pretty worn-out theme a la college yesteryears that would usually make me vomit, but I trust this gallery and think if anyone can put together a show about "memories," well, they're the ones who could probably do it right. Obviously, there will be  urlLink  art   and there will be  urlLink music . Whether or not you like the artists or the music, ConWorks always puts on a good event in their multi-disciplinary warehouse caverns (the only qualm being the horrendous service at their bars, which are fucking impossible to get a drink at unless you cut or flirt your way in). This is also  urlLink Dylan Neuwirth's  first time curating at ConWorks.     Saturday, May 15   And there's another art event tonight too. I know, I'm a loser, I haven't yet been to the  urlLink Capital Hill Arts Center  but I'm excited to experience what I have only heard great things about.  urlLink "Big In Japan"  sounds like it could have potential, with midnight fashion show and all. And, besides, one of the folks performing will be  urlLink Anna Oxygen , and any girl who can rock it with a keytar while wearing leg-warmers is, well, the proverbial "cool." If you join Graylife's  urlLink mailing list , you can get in for free, otherwise it's $5.  The  urlLink Sunset Tavern  is also having a benefit show for the (get this:) "Puget Sound Skateboard Association" (yeah, those punks trying to save that Ballard Bowl piece-of-shit). The hilarious part is that they're even having an activist-style  urlLink "skate/march"  earlier in the day. To see them all "skate/marching" down the street should be, uh, very entertaining. If Eye were the city, she would keep the Ballard Bowl just so she didn't have to see a sight like that ever again (and, by the way, I think it's great they're organizing to make a point, even if it's over the stupid Ballard Bowl... now, if we could just get them to  vote ...). Anyway, oldschool  urlLink Mudhoney , Tyco Party and even  urlLink the Spits  (go ahead and laugh for those of you who remember that  one  time with that one Spit) are playing. It's $10.  Oh, and Jonathan Raban, the Northwest author of "Waxwings" who was listed for last year's Booker Prize, wrote an interesting academic-ish article in The Stranger this week about Orientalism in regards to Iraq (read it  urlLink here ).

      Check out our own  urlLink  United State of Electronica   (i.e. U.S.E., Use, Noah Star Weaver rocks the kasbah) on the snootiest most-indie-music-reviewer site of all, Pitchfork, by going  urlLink  here  .   They're in Norman, Oklahoma, today. And I bet they wish they were still in Seattle.   urlLink  Here's   what I thought of them last July back when they were just PBR-chuggers on my (currently ex-) boyfriend's couch. Oh yeah, I guess they haven't stopped drinking PBR yet.

      So, Momma E turned 54 last night and she would kill her firstborn if she ever knew that number went public. As it was, the whole Eagle flock was ready to kill each other in typical form last night--yelling match, threats of fatal heart attack, mention of the forbidden word "penis" by teenage brother, cheap generic birthday cake purchased by spiteful father and all. Us Ebrahimi's love getting together. And we love each other too. Really.   Last night's viewing of "The Runway Ahead" (see earlier post) was confirming in Eye's previous assumptions about said would-be-models: Top Model winner  urlLink  Yoanna   is a boobless waif no better than  urlLink  Jared   and she has no personality to speak of, despite gushing popular opinion. Can we say eating disorder poster child?  urlLink  Shandi   should have stayed at Walgreens with her retarded boyfriend who was humiliated on national television (and why wasn't this on Fox??).  urlLink  Jenascia   is a  urlLink  Hooters   hoe-bag. And, well, it's obvious to Eye who should have won. Clearly,  urlLink  Sarah   (even though she's a ditz). And not just because she's a Persian from Sea-town either. (Links galore for the truly bored  urlLink  here.  )  Oh, and I guess  urlLink  Peaches   played at Neumo's last night.

      That's right: Being a proponent of "a penny saved is a penny earned," Eagle Eye Ebrahimi (a.k.a. "EEE," "Triple E" or simply "Eye") has decided to consolidate her many electronic mail messages into one informative blog so as to reduce the amount of time re-typing the exact same thing to various persons.   This blog will detail the upcoming week's events pertinent to Eye and co. in majestic Seattle, as well as review past events attended. EEE is employed at a firm in which every increment of 15 minutes must be recorded and "billed" to a client, so she hopes that this blog will reduce aforementioned repetition and increase productivity at work. Eye is also known to be oftentimes delusional.  SCHEDULE FOR MAY 11 TO MAY 13TH:    Tuesday, May 11    Happy Birthday Mother Ebrahimi! Yes, that's right: The nest-maker herself was birthed into the world on this very day. In celebration, Eye will be cooking up a storm at her residence. With roommate Thaddeus Tierney (a.k.a. "TT," "TIERNEY!" "collector-of-cheerio-boxes-and-sunflower-eater" or said acronym) at work for the night, Eye will attempt at impressing Mother E at all costs, sans pork. Also in attendance will be brother "Shags" Ebrahimi and father "Yags" Ebrahimi. "I think it will be a delightful evening!" Eye was noted saying.  After long wait, this fine night is also the airing of "America's Next Top Model" followup episode featuring model-hopefuls "Shandi," "Yoanna" and even Eye's favorite Persian beauty "Sarah." Eye will be viewing the episode at her friend Jeff's Greenlake abode. View the trailer for "The Runway Ahead" by going  urlLink  here  .     Wednesday, May 12    Tonight is the notorious night of  urlLink  Revolver   at Chop Suey. It's only $5 before 10p.m. and $7 after. Revolver is a DJed party held every second Wednesday of the month at the aforementioned venue. It features Seattle's equally notorious indie nightlife characters, including DJ  urlLink  PacoGordo   (also known for  urlLink  Casa Caliente's   wild houseparties and his love of  urlLink  vespas  ), The Lashes (Seattle's rudest punk band who are regulars at Pine Street's Cha Cha Bar and whose lead singer  urlLink  Ben   works at beloved Sonic Boom Records; check out some articles of the pseudo celebs from the Seattle Weakly by going  urlLink  here   and  urlLink  here  ) and other Lookout Records recording artists.   Also in the works is Movie Night at Vespa Capital U.S.A. (house location withheld). Times and attendees are yet unknown, but the group of vespa-loving scenesters (yes, all scooter aficionados know each other) have decided to begin a weekly Movie Night in which they air unreleased films they pirate off the World Wide Web. Popcorn machine and cheap beer should be readily available. Leave your maturity at the door, as these boys have also been known to play a game of Dungeons & Dragons every now and then (when they aren't pretending to be cool out on the streets). Movie of the night will be  urlLink  KillBill2  , starring Uma Thurman.     Thursday, May 13th    My good friend Jeff is also the bassist for the  urlLink   Lights  , our small town's band-with-the-current-buzz. They play dancable garage and always put on a pretty tight show. Selected by The Stranger weekly to be a part of prestigious showcase at Austin's South By Southwest (SXSW) music festival, the Lights now enjoy regular press praise, including recent mention by Kurt Cobain biographer Charles Cross in Grammy Magazine (read it  urlLink  here  ). Tonight, they will be playing with Portland's Lifesavas (hip hop, funk and all that makes you shake it), Hollertronix (supposedly "the dopest mash up of DJs around") and Don Caballero whoever he is. The event is FREE, presented by The Stranger and KEXP for Chop Suey's "2 Year Anniversary" (but wait, isn't  urlLink  ChopSuey   more than two years old?). Door open at 7p.m. and there are $2 beers between 7 and 9.    Okay folks, well that's all for now. Until next time, this is Eagle Eye Ebrahimi in Seattle, Washington, bringing the events that are worthwhile to your electronic portal...
