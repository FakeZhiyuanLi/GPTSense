      Rain. We’ve been getting a lot of it here lately and man, do I welcome it. The summers here are so devastatingly HOT that anything to make June feel less like summer is fine with me. We’ll just keep denying that August is around the corner and just keep telling ourselves that maybe this year it won’t come. Maybe if we’re quiet enough and we all get out ALL of our sweaters (in Texas that's like THREE), Summer will forget about us in all of our deserts and cows and nothingness, and just pass us up, leaving us in modest double-digit temperatures with regular precipitation patterns.   Hey, I can dream.  The thunder is rollllling across the sky like bowling balls right now. Then there is that occasional  BANG!  that makes my heart skip a beat. And now it’s pouring. Hammers falling from the sky.   I could so use a piece of apple pie and an episode of Full House right now. There is nothing like Uncle Jesse, a loud scary thunderstorm, and a 1200 calorie dessert to make a girl feel all warm and cozy inside.

      The one thing here where I live that is in fact quite characteristic of tropical climates, specifically the South Pacific, is the size and number of cockroaches. It couldn't be that the two geographical locations, as far apart as they are, could share, say, macadamia nuts or waterfalls. No. The only thing this pathetic state has in common with tropical paradise are creepy, crunchy cockroaches.     I remember my stay in Oahu, even though I was only thirteen then. My dad paid for me and my sister to spend a week on the Islands, a way of getting me out of his hair for the summer. I had to have a chaperone, so he reluctantly bought my sister a ticket as well. Together we made the eight-hour plane voyage in first class, my sister giving me sips of her rum and coke the whole time, until I could no longer stay awake and passed out while watching that movie about the dogs who are trying to find their way home.     Our condo in Oahu overlooked a golf course and I could smell the sugarcane in the air. The condo was very nice on the inside, a little outdated with its 70s decor, but nice. However, we soon discovered why there was no food at all in the kitchen. The minute we left something sitting on the counter, a dozen cockroaches the size of tongue depressors would have it devoured before we could get to it.     My sister would scream and fly into a tizzy, but I really didn't care. At thirteen I had yet to develop a fear of a lot of things, including bugs. I rode dangerous rollercoasters, jumped off high-dives at waterparks, and watched scary movies while home alone. Cockroaches didn't faze me.     They certainly bother me now, though. Now that I have to live with them on a daily basis. I spent most of my childhood in urban apartment homes where there are so many pesticides that one never really has to worry about bugs. But now that I'm a homeowner in a more secluded area with trees and dirt roads, there are bugs galore. In fact, just yesterday I found a tarantula on my back porch. It was the third one I've seen this summer. But you know what? I didn't kill him, creepy as he was. Nope. I left him alive to go and eat the cockroaches.

      Good morning blogosphere and welcome to my online journal. I don't know what name is going to show up at the bottom of this entry, but here, in my own pathetic virtual creation of where I most with I was (and where I am so far away from), I will go by my Hawaiian name, that is, what my name would be if I had a Hawaiian name. I actually have no Hawaiian roots, just a cheap canvas souvenier bag with cute little glitter and sequence and a drawing of a beautiful Hawaiian native resting on the beach. I stare at my bag a lot and think "If only I could make that come to life..." then all would be well in my world.     I desperately need a vacation if you hadn't noticed.     To give a little background information, I am twenty-three; a scorpio, a student, a mother, a wife, a daughter, and my life is TRAGIC. :-) I will brag about my collegiate accomplishments a lot here, and you will eventually grow weary of it and think to yourself, "Shut up, bitch. It's not like you're at Harvard!" And you will be absolutely correct. I will post stories about how this or that thing moved me to tears and all of the deep and heavy emotions this or that thing inspired in me, and no one else could possibly understand this or that thing because I am a complex and mysterious snowflake who just can't be understood. I will speak ambiguously of my family and numerous familial problems, because, after all, this is the Internet, and anyone can read a blog.     I am interested in reading, writing, dreaming, and one day visiting some other non-tropical parts of the globe, like Thailand or Russia. I like proper use of capital letters and punctuation. I have an addiction to M&Ms. I don't like it when people say "ergo" instead of "therefore." I like Malibu Rum and drinks that come with little pink umbrellas or cherries on a plastic sword.

      I read in a book once about a girl who had reached the very bottom of her depression--the ugliest, darkest, most hopeless stage in life--and she killed some pet fish by pouring a bottle of bleach in the tank. This made her feel better about everything crappy in her life.   Many people choose to kill living things when they get depressed. That girl in the book killed fish, the girl in  Monster  killed Johns, and me: I kill plants. Not intentionally, of course, but something happens to me when I get in a funk that makes me unable to water the unfortunate greenlife in my home. Right now there are only two plants who are suffering, and although I feel bad about, I just sit and stare at them and continue to let them wither and shrivel, knowing how thirsty they are and not doing anything about it.   So, this morning I forced myself to give them a little bit of water, because after years of off and on antidepression medication, I have finally learned how to control the funks on my own. And I'm going to buy a new pair of jeans today, even though I know I shouldn't really spend $59.99 plus tax at the Gap. Somehow I got it in my head that giving my hard earned and much needed earnings to a company whose clothes come from slave children overseas will make me feel better about myself.   And, yes, I suppose I lied about the blog break. Everything computer-related is intact the moment, but it won't be for long.

      Ladies and gentlemen, I will be leaving the South Pacific for a few days on account of some computer issues. I know how much you will miss me and I just know you will grieve for my daily mindless chattering, but hang in there: I shall return.

      Ladies, today I made the obersvation that we as women are born intellectually and emotionally superior to the majority of our male counterparts. We know it, we accept it, but sometimes we do forget it. That is, until some construction worker pulls up next to our vehicle so he can make googly eyes at us while driving 45 mph.   This afternoon my daughter (whose name would translate to  Kalala --seems a bit much)  and I were on our way home, having just left the drive-through, when a white construction truck in the lane next to me pulls up right beside my own car. His window is down, as is my passenger window, and he proceeds to make a series of faces at me, starting with the universal gesture that means "What's up, Hot Stuff": the nod. Meanwhile, I am trying to take in the fact that this man is seriously imagining whatever boys imagine when they road-stalk girls on four lane highways, and wondering how it could be that this person had the idea to hit on me while I'm minding my own business, eating my lunch in the car.  Oooh, Baby, I love the way you bite into your Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich. Spill that iced tea in your lap one more time for me please, will ya?  Did he completely ignore the two year old in the back seat who was screaming that her chicken needed jelly?   Every time I slowed down, so did he. I sped up, so did he. I actually have a theory about this kind of male behavior that is not so humorous, and a lot more "angry feminist," but I don't want to reveal my true colors just yet. ;-)

      I am publicly making a promise to myself, right here, right now, to resist the urge to take another single bite of raw, homemade cookie dough. This is the third batch I've made in a week, and I'm feeling a little sinful and bogged down by a total of 6 sticks butter, 3 cups sugar, and about 250 milk chocolate chips. The dough is waiting for me in the fridge at this very moment, but I am strong, I will not break. "I know it's only 7:30 in the morning," the dough says to me. "But you know you want to eat me. It's so easy; just get a spoon and savor those crunchy chocolate chips mixed with cold whipped butter and egg yolk for breakfast. Eat me now and you're insulin levels will be spiked sky high before lunchtime. It'll be great and don't worry: when you feel like you're gonna crash, just come eat some more of me. I'll be right here waiting for you."    It's like heroin. Yesterday I gave in to the dough's persuasive calling; in fact, other than a couple bites of cucumber salad and pasta for dinner, I didn't have anything else to eat but cookies or cookie dough. Today will be different though. Not only am I breaking things off cold turkey with the dough, I'm going to exercise as well! Because it's been a very long time since I've done anything that required energy or movement, I will probably just start with stretching. Gotta start somewhere.   This is my what? Third? Fourth post this week?  Get a life, Kala , is what you're probably thinking.  Don't you have anything better to do than change everyone's name into Hawaiian and blog about your pathetic slothy existence?  Well, the answer to that question is: no, I don't. And I bet neither do you.

      I've requested the next available Sunday morning off from work so that my friend Lakele and I (I know she wants to hit me every time I call her that ridiculous name) can go get our worship on at the Black church. I went there once before on an assignment for Sociology class and had to duck out of the service early because I needed to get home; I wasn't prepared for a three hour service! But it was a good time and I want to go back.  In my essay on the church, I wrote about how nice and accepting the congregation was. And I LOVED the choir music. Who else can belt out the same five words over and over without ever losing enthusiasm?  Jesus, I'll never forget you  can go on for a good twenty minutes, and no one gets tired of it. Everyone claps and bobs and shifts their hips to the rhythm right up until the very last "you"  is sung. It was one of the coolest concerts I'd ever been to. You can just feel the love in the air.  In prayer, they all shout out encouraging words to the deacon:  Amen! ,  You said it! ,  That's RIGHT!  I never dreamed of doing such a thing in the conservative Baptist churches my mom took me to as a child. Services were so quiet that my own eight year old thoughts seemed to echo like tumbling lottery balls in my head. And we were forced to learn long verses of songs that felt like funeral music. Church seemed more like after school detention, something to dread and fake an illness for. At the African American churches, the services are big parties with singing, dancing, and a few quiet moments mixed in to say thanks to their heavenly host.

      Unlike in the online world where a winky face very clearly means "Just kidding!" (or "Hey, I'm being funny!"), the Wink in real life contains several connotations and must be used sparingly and with discretion. Winks have their place on the Internet, but in real life I have never been a fan of the Wink (neither giving nor receiving). However, that doesn't mean that I haven't, on occasion, given an acccidental wink at someone and then been left to wonder how my purely involuntary eye muscle movement was perceived.   Sometimes at work I get so caught up in being phony with the customers, that some other personality takes over, a personality that not only winks, but speaks in a munchkin voice (why do we females equate high-pitched with nice sounding?). It's as if I get so overwhelmed with the fakeness, that I just can't help myself: "Yes, ma'am! That tangerine glass vase looks LOVELY with those Christmas table linens! And you're getting such a bargain!  WINK! "   But it's worse when the ma'am is a sir. Yesterday I winked at Sir Shopping With His Mother and he grinned stupidly at me until they left the store. I just wanted to tell him that I didn't mean it, it was my other personality! I'm really not a winker, I swear!  Thankfully, there are also the customers that I genuinely like and never have to be fake with. Those customers never get winks or helium voice girl, and they seem to appreciate it all just the same.

      Isn't it so embarrassing, even if only to yourself, when you finally realize that after years of singing the same misheard lyrics to a song, you've had it all wrong, and that Eddie Vedder in Pearl Jam really isn't saying  homo gnomes at 8:30  but  home alone at age thirteen ? Being the "Read Along" music listener that I am, I actually knew the correct lyrics to "Alive" but some people at  urlLink this site  didn't. They also thought that in Eddie's poetic "Black" he was saying  queafs of envied pandas  when the song actually says  sheets of emptied canvas  (or something along those lines).   But I am no lyrics genius. Many times in my life I have shamelessly danced around the house feeling empowered while jamming to Aretha Franklin's "Respect." And I always thought she said:  you're runnin' outta food, and I ain't lyin' . I mean, it makes sense, right? If her man doesn't shape up and stop disrespectin', Aretha's gonna cut off his supply of pork chops and mashed potatoes, right? WRONG. It's  you're runnin' out of foolin' . Well, who knew. I didn't know "foolin'" was sumthin people run out of.   So, confession time: what have YOU misheard??

      Late this morning my subconscious decided to entertain me once more with the sequal to the Stuck on an Island dream. This dream was a perfect example of the warm and fuzzy kinds of dreams that make me want to stay in bed just a little longer...  I'm sitting in a bar with a nameless, unidentifiable "friend" whom I suspect is actually Scarlet Johannson (the actress in Girl With a Pearl Earring), and as we're talking over our expensive cocktails about what a dork the bartender from New York is, the scene suddenly changes: in walks Kurt Cobain (never mind that he's been dead ten years) and a Courtney Love look-alike, who is actually his new wife (she looks like Love but sweeter and not-so-skanky). Immediately, Kurt approaches me with business offer: he wants me to join Nirvana.   First, Kurt explains, I will need a "new look," then I can learn to play the guitar. He informs me that the public doesn't care if I'm talented, they just want someone who  looks  like a rock star. I tell him that being in a band could be difficult because I have daughter. He tells me he has one too, but he never gets to see her. Her name is Frances Bean.   I tell him I'm not into Heroin. He tells me he isn't either, it was all just a big publicity stunt.   So as we are discussing the details--how this Love look-alike is going to be my mentor and Kurt will buy me anything my heart desires--we turn to the television that's on in the bar. The screen shows an island that's beginning to shake and wiggle, and then--poof!--it disappears. It was a natural disaster first: the very first time an entire island ever sunk to the bottom of the ocean.  I woke up just after Kurt and New Wife put their arms around me. I was disappointed as I lay there in my bed, knowing Kurt is really dead, I am really not a rock star, and oceans don't swallow islands whole.

      At last, I have started implementing my redecorating plan--Operation Redecorate 2004--with the help of my good friend, Lakele (everyone must go my Hawaiian names here!) who is studying Interior Design. Together we will turn my living room into a Purple Paradise. I have already started painting, and after 6 hours of non-stop rolling, taping, and inhaling carcinogenic fumes, I can't even say I'm halfway done.   Today I am going to go look for purple fabric in order to make drapery for the windows. I have this vision of myself doing yoga on the blue yoga mat (that I have yet to buy) to the yoga DVD (that I have yet to buy) while a cool breeze blows through the sheer, purple-colored silk, making sunlight and shadows flicker and dance along the freshly painted walls, and thus my yoga experience will be the most spiritual and mentally satisfying to date. Since we decided on the drapery color, that ultra-feminine, purple-loving, girly-girl inside has been daydreaming of what's to come.   In other news, the rugrat won't stop barfing. There's nothing like having a two year with a stomach bug in the house. Toddlers have NO aim which means barf goes everywhere: rug, pillows, my hair, the bottom right crisper drawer in the refrigerator. They are just like little barf bombs, ticking to go off at any second. Last time she was sick, it took us seven loads of laundry and three bottles of Bac-Out to recover.   Redecorating and Barf. I hope you all enjoyed this little glimpse into my fabulous life.

       I just love the way our subconscious minds communicate to us, especially through dreams. My dreams always come late in the morning, just before waking up. When the dream is over, I always get out of bed and either shudder in terror or grin stupidly to myself, depending on what the dream was. Sometimes there are the warm fuzzy dreams where I have that perfect job or I'm sitting at a table surrounded by friends and we're all laughing. Those dreams make me want to stay in bed all day and dream the same dream over and over. Other times there are the scary dreams, like the ones where I yell in my dad's face all the things I ever wanted to say to him (something I never did before he died), and I'm glad when I finally wake up. Then there are the dreams that are so obvious in their meaning, so unoriginal and lacking in creativity or substance, that I can't help laughing at my subconscious. This morning I had one of those.  I am stuck on a deserted island, with some raggedy excuse for clothing. I am dirty and cold and sitting on the beach, staring at the waves, when along comes a canoe with a single paddle. It's just floating to the shore, right there in front of me. So I jump in the canoe and start paddling the one paddle with all I've got. But it's going up stream, and almost immediately it's proving to be an impossible task as after only a few minutes my arms are sore and aching. But I manage to go just a little farther, until I see in the distance a red fire truck. As I get closer, I can see the firemen have a ladder extended for me. When I get just close enough I grab the ladder and the firemen pull me in. Rescued!   The firemen were kind and gentle and wanted to know all about my perilous adventure upstream. They gave me grooming supplies: a brush, some clothes, soap to wash off the dirt, and told me they were taking me home. Then I woke up.   To me, this dream is so cliche that I had to write it down, lest I forget how unoriginal my mind can be.

      Sometimes I think I have the spirit, the wisdom, and the bones of a ninety-nine year old woman. I have seen a lot in my lifetime and I think my body is starting to protest. "No more!" it is saying to me. "We don't want to experience anymore tough times. Let's just relax with a pint of icecream and  Whose Line Is It Anyway?  and let those tough times wash over us like so much caramel in Ben & Jerry's  Karmel Sutra ."     Well, Body, if only things were that simple.     I am making a promise though, to myself, to bring back some youthfulness to that beating heart inside me. See, although my internal self is popping and cracking and aching and inflamed, my external self looks like she's about eighteen years old. She gets carded for lottery tickets even though she will be twenty-four in just a few months. But the irony is that if you look really close, just beyond the smooth skin speckled with freckles from summer, the round, rosy cheeks, the sunburned, cherub mouth and the few dot-to-dot blemishes of a high school girl, you will see wrinkles and dark circles around the eyes. If one feels old in spirit, no matter how youthful in appearance, that "old" will find a way out. It will manifest itself around the eyes, in the joints, in the muscles, and eat you alive like a cancer.     What I need more than anything is some R&R. For some reason my busy-body self has decided this means  painting the living room . No, the act of painting is not relaxing and will probably leave my back a mess of jumpled knots (as if it isn't already), but I'm thinking long term here. Painting the living room a nice color will make it more inviting, thus allowing me to relax in it. This project begins on Friday.    The other thing I'm considering is a hot salt scrub massage thingy. (I don't know the exact name but you get the idea.) That sounds like  Heaven , especially if it's performed by a Ryan Gosling look-alike with his shirt off. (Just watch, I'll get that--but he'll be gay). And some new shoes to cradle my feet in soft, loving ecstacy while I stand on them for eight hours at a time.     Baby steps, People. Baby steps. I'll get twenty-three again, you wait and see.     ---    Now that I know my dear friend--my favorite OTB buddy, my favorite person to see  The Notebook  with--is reading, I have to give a shout out. Wassup chick! Stop "snuckering!" (

      Last night I came home from class to discover that my two year old was running a fever. I asked my husband, who had been home with her for three hours previous, just when he was planning on telling me that I could fry an egg on our daughter's forehead. I guess he hadn't noticed.   So before going to bed I gave him the drill.   You Know Your Child Has a Fever When:  - all of the "key" body parts are hot: soles of the feet, palms of the hands, armpits, neck, back of neck, and forehead.  - her eyes are glossy - she doesn't want to play - that thing we call a "thermometer" has little numbers in the window that read higher than 98.6  At 2:00 am she was 102.9 and she had taken the maximum dose of Motrin just a couple hours before. So we took off to the E.R. During the car ride there I knew she would be fine, but that is what we moms do. Your child is ill and you need to confirm what you already know: that she will be fine. Instincts are powerful and, most of the time, accurate, but God forbid you listened solely to that instinct and it turned out you were terribly wrong. So you drag your tired self, who really, really needed a good night's sleep, and your sick baby, who really, really is going to be okay, to the hospital where the staff knows why you're there--to confirm what you already know--and they are happy to oblige.   They even gave her a teddy bear, a small consolation prize, in my opinion, for the everything they put her through.

      One fateful day in 1988 I was nominated as the spokesperson for the Republican party in my third grade classroom as part of a mock election. My birthday had fallen on election day that year and the teacher thought it would be nice to let me have all the fun and attention. After giving my speech and tallying up votes it was determined that I would be the new president of the United States.   When I got home that day my parents were beaming with conservative pride. Not only had George Sr. just been reelected, but their little girl was out spreading conservatism to the third grade. Whereas everything else in their life together was a total failure, creating staunch Republican children was a success. Everyone was so happy that they went out and had a trophy made just for me. It was a plastic Statue of Liberty that read, "To Our #1 Republican."   Fast forward 16 years and things are a little different. This #1 Republican is now #1 Sinner because she called the current president a "creep" and thinks maybe, just maybe, there are bigger fish to fry than worrying about gay people getting married. A small rage burns inside me when politics are discussed among my family because their views are so out there and inconsistent with the way they live their lives. They are the numero uno hypocritos.   Just a few days ago my husband put a Kerry/Edwards bumper sticker on our car. I'm not crazy about Kerry, but I'm passionate about many of the democratic views; on all polls and surveys I fall pretty far to the left; and I do like Edwards a lot. Given our two choices, I am happy to support Kerry with a bumper sticker. However, the first time the car left our garage with the new "A Stronger America" sign on its bumper, someone felt the need to honk and flip us off. Maybe instead of the Statue of Liberty on my trophy that day it should have been THAT guy with his middle finger.

      When I was little we didn't have cable or even a VCR for the first five or six years of my life, so I don't have very many TV watching memories before then. Basically I can remember watching The Monkeys (my five year old hear went THUMP thump for Mr. Davey Jones), The Smurfs ("Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!"), and the only two shows that PBS had to offer back then: Sesame Street and Reading Rainbow.   For me, Reading Rainbow was one of those shows like (when actually did get cable) Leave it to Beaver or Dennis the Menace. As kids never actually watched those shows voluntarily; we only watched them because there was nothing else on. We grew to resent everything filmed in black and white that wasn't about a talking horse or a red-headed lady who was always pissing off her Cuban husband. I also grew to resent Reading Rainbow for being on right after Sesame Street yet RR didn't have any talking puppets or lively animation. I watched it reluctantly and with disdain.   But now Reading Rainbow is fast becoming one of my favorite shows (I'm serious). My adult heart goes Thump Thump for Mr. Lavar Burton, although I think he might be gay. But nevertheless, I recently learned about Native American pottery, bats, and medicine men in the Amazon. There is more content in Reading Rainbow, a kids' show, than there is in most primetime television.   All of this nostalgic TV watching has also inspired me to re-read some of my old favorites as a kid (thankfully I have a ten year old niece whom I can use as an excuse). I am happy to report that the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle series really IS that good.

      Writing a blog entry at the library must feel a lot like having a private conversation in jail. There are people everywhere yet everything is completely silent, and this 14 point font might as well be screaming my words to the other patrons. The screen of this computer displays my innermost thoughts to all the people and goings on around me; meanwhile I can't see anything but the wall, leaving me totally absorbed in the fast click-clack of the keyboard that is noticeable (and probably annoying) to all. With this kind of anxiety I think I would make a terrible prisoner.   Anyway, it is good to write again. Writing is many things to me: it's my "me" time, my escape, my one (semi) talent, and it's my way of cleaning out the millions of wandering thoughts that muddle my overactive mind on a daily basis. I hope to return permanently the South Pacific soon.   Unfortunately my time is already up and it's back to my cell where I stare at the wall all day and try to dream of clever ways of escaping. I'm counting down the days until my release. Until then...tell my two readers that I'll be coming home soon (hopefully next week).
