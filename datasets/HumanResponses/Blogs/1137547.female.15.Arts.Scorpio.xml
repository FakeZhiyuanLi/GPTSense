      Its close to impossible. Not just becuase most IB kids are doing homework from the time they get home till they have to wake up between four and five in the morning, but because the selection is so low. Its really quite sad, especially for Kemps Landing Alumni.  You see, there are one hundered PIB freshman. Of those one hundered students, roughly twenty to thirty are male. Out of those, about eleven or twelve are not Kemps Landing Alumni. Out of those, one has a girlfriend, several are most likely gay, and the rest, well, hardly suitable.  Well, why not date those other male students? The answer is quite simple. At least for me and my friends, its not so much that they aren't dating worthy, but its just either they are really good friends or theyve taken on brotherly qualities.  Well, why not date out of the regular student population? Most of our classes are with other IB students, therefore, only a couple classes are taken with regular students, and its hard to get to know them. Not to mention, we appreciate intelligent conversation.. Im wondering how long Im going to have to endure being single.  And wow, this post sounds reallly awful of me.

      Since IB students are worked extra hard, generally get less sleep, and have to wake up extra early to catch a bus for a school that is on the other side of the city, it would make sense that for the SOLs, they would provide a split bus schedule for inzone kids, but not out of zone IB kids. Let me explain, during the weeks of SOLs, you dont technically have to go to school until 9:55 if you don't have a test. Thus, there are two bus runs for in zone kids, one for those who are taking a test, and one for those who aren't. IB kids aren't so lucky. Its either, get a ride, or come into school and sit in a study hall for two hours.  I guess there is really nothing to complain about, but a couple of extra hours of sleep would be nice. I'm still going to be catching the bus at a quarter past six though. The only good thing about having a forty minute bus ride is that it is a perfect opportunity for you to b.s. your block one homework.

      I suppose that if anyone at all is reading this and is familliar with the International Baccalaureshit program they might be wondering how in the world I can be a freshman in IB. Typically, the IB programs spans a students junior and senior years in highschool to prepare them for college. Pre IB, then, is to prepare students for the actual IB academy program.  Essentially, its like putting an innocent person in the stocks and hitting them with half-eaten apples before actually carrying out their sentence, whatever it may be.  It strikes me as interesting that they need a program to prepare for a prepetory program. What's ever more interesting is the 'Early Years' program that my city is establishing in one of the middle schools; a middle school program that is for, ironically enough, the prepartion of young student for the IB program.  And yet, as the standards of IB are being raised with every passing state test, as all schools in fact, are raising their standards, the average student is becoming more lazy, less educated, and in many cases, essentially illiterate. So much, in fact, that the Virginia Standards of Learning Tests (SOLs) are under hot debate. The question? Shoule we get rid of them, becuase they are too hard for the average student. It's incrediblly hard, and I'm not trying to sound like an eliteist or whatever else they've been calling IB students these days, for an IB kid to comprehend how in the world the SOLs can be too difficult. We fail to realize that while we worry about paswsing advanced, most kids worry about whether or not they're going to pass at all. I suppose its even harder for me to understand this seeing as I went to the one and only middle school magnet program for many, many miles (by that I mean like magnet schools are hardly anywhere). And because I had that 'gifted education' the Pre IB program is extremely easy for me and basically filled with a bunch of nonsense busy work. I'm anticipating a fairly easy introduction to the IB program, and most people who graduate with an IB diploma find that college is a whole lot easier than their actual high school IB classes. I guess then, that all the preperation is good, but for us students, its like living in hell.

      True to the IB way, Im going to be a slacker with this blog. Usually, I make everything all pretty and lovely and whatnot, but why bother? I already have a webpage, another blog, and a xanga, which I keep quite nice, so why make my IB blog good looking at all. It doesn't deserve it. IB is for slackers who are good at bull shitting.

      I figured I needed a place to rant and rave about how absolutely sickenig the International Baccalaureate Program is, and how absolutely unacceptable it is that I finally learned how to spell all that. My name is Rae and I am currently a freshman at a Virginia IB school. These are my complaints.
