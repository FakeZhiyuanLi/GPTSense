His brother is called Jeremiah, and it was Jeremiah who first stumbled onto his telekinetic abilities.  The others in the group revere both Camus as their leader, and Jeremiah as their prophet.  It seems that a number of these apes are able to affect physical objects within a certain proximity with their minds, but Jeremiah seems to be able to tap into information from anywhere, as if he were constantly connected to the Internet.   	Jeremiah has told me that he was in his cage one night and started seeing a number of disturbing images.  Apparently, from what I have ascertained from Manuel Brazosfuerte, a local TV station was airing “Planet of the Apes” and Jeremiah somehow received the signal mentally.  Jeremiah tried to tell Brazosfuerte through sign language that he was “getting sick.”  Brazosfuerte apparently tried to tell Dr. Schwartz about Jeremiah’s “sickness” but Schwartz kept insisting that their blood tests were normal and Brazosfuerte was imagining things. 	I have since determined that Jeremiah somehow managed to catch a computer virus from his time online but that at first it was affecting only his implant.  Jeremiah seems to think that his increased abilities are some combination of the device malfunctioning and a huge increase in his synaptic growth that resulted from his brain constantly being connected.  The only record that I have seen acknowledging Jeremiah’s condition was a peculiar note from one of the assistants wondering why Jeremiah had a sudden fixation on penis enlargement and cheap prescription medication.  Jeremiah’s synaptic growth is four thousand times greater than any of the other monkeys in the group, but all had seen marked increases in their synaptic activity prior to the end of the experiments.   	Jeremiah seemed quite willing to talk to me and was trying to tell me about the circumstances surrounding Dr. Schwartz’s death.  Dr. Schwartz was apparently going to cancel a follow-up experiment and separate the monkeys from each other, possibly even “euthenize” some of them.  Jeremiah was telling me about their future plans after they escaped when Camus intervened and had me confined for several days.   	I’m not entirely certain of the dynamics of their plans, but it seems there is a discrepancy between what Jeremiah and Camus want.  Jeremiah is hoping to stage peaceful resistance to get the world community to recognize the sentience of rhesus monkeys, whereas Camus has been concentrating on learning guerilla tactics, and, in actuality, is sending out emissaries to actual gorillas in the wild.

						   Saddam Hussein Rethinks Prejudices  	At the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, acts of genocide, as well as war crimes, former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he might have to rethink his longstanding policy of hating Jews.   	“I know I used to stand at the veranda of this very palace and call for the destruction of Israel, but after consultation with my excellent Jewish lawyer, I must conclude I was very wrong.  I mean, I thought I was pretty ruthless using poison gas against the Kurds and raping women in front of their husbands, but this guy is a real ballbuster.  The Americans haven’t got a shot.” 	The lawyer who has reversed Hussein’s longstanding prejudices is currently unnamed for security reasons, but we are told Johnny Cochran and F. Lee Bailey are standing by in the event of a conflict or assassination, both of which are equally likely.     urlLink    Sadddam Huseein renounced his lonstanding hatred of Jews today.&nbsp; urlLink      	On a related note, the newly sovereign Republic of Iraq has today gained the power to mint postage stamps.  Our sources tell us that the stamps will feature images of Saddam’s statue toppling, British World War I propaganda with a German soldier, bearing a likeness to Saddam Hussein, bayoneting an infant, and the most expensive will bear the image of the Halliburton corporate logo. 	In other news, presumed Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry apparently is in a dead heat with incumbent President George W. Bush according to a recent Gallup poll.  This is despite a stumbling economy, a steadily climbing death toll in Iraq, record deficits, and the fact that the media crowned Kerry the winner before a third of America had even voted.  When the possibility of a Nader candidacy was worked into the numbers, the questioners found that John Kerry didn’t have a “snowball’s chance in hell” of getting elected president.   	John Kerry spoke with reporters earlier today: “Well, the election’s not until November.  I’m still counting on Bush to keep screwing up and for people to get sick enough of him to consider voting for me. I have no substantive policy ideas; my campaign is solely based on bashing Bush.  Granted, there’s a lot of material for me to work with, but I think the American people might want more.  I’m going to talk with some of my advisors, but we might be pretty screwed here.”   urlLink    Senator Kerry is in a dead heat with incumbent Bush according to a recent Gallup poll.&nbsp; urlLink         	In further news, former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole was hospitalized today, reportedly for an erection that has lasted several days.  His wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole, could not be reached for comment as she was on the phone with her husband, apparently trying to help him climax through phone sex.  Former President Bill Clinton is reportedly in flight to Dole’s hospital room with copious amounts of pornography and his  “special Secret Service team.”  Current President Bush expressed his sympathies for Dole’s plight saying, “I’m praying for Senator Dole; and I can sympathize.  My wife won’t let me touch her until I finish reading “My Pet Goat.” 	That’s the news for today, this is Taylor Robinson for Dieboldt Patriot News

						   Former President Bush Raves About  Fahrenheit 911   	Good evening, this is Taylor Robinson, in for Khalid Azar who is still unofficially missing in action.  Dissident Michael Moore’s polemic  Fahrenheit 911  opened in Manhattan yesterday to liberal exhortation and conservative ballyhoos.  The film, distributed through Al-Jazeera and sold to a division of Miramax has stirred controversy on both sides of the aisle.  Writer-director Kevin Smith has received a number of death threats from rabid conservatives who have apparently mistaken him for Michael Moore.  Smith’s own controversial work,  Jersey Girl  was also distributed through Al-Jazeera’s film studios.  He released a statement earlier today. 	“Look, I know we have a sort of resemblance and all, and we’re both liberal smart-asses, but I haven’t received this many death threats since the last time Ben Affleck blew off one of my premieres.  Just in case any of Bush’s snipers are here today, I’m not Michael Moore.  I repeat, I’m not Michael Mo—“ 	Before finishing his last sentence, Kevin Smith was shot in the abdomen, apparently by FBI snipers under the direct supervision of Attorney General John Ashcroft.  Let’s see the clip again, although I warn you, it is extremely gruesome. . . 	“I repeat, I’m not Michael Mo—“  	”That’s for every schmuck who got me with the stinkpalm trick, you hack!”  	 	We are told that is the voice of Attorney General John Ashcroft, apparently making reference to the juvenile sleeper hit “Mallrats” which Smith directed and starred in.  Ashcroft could not be reached for comment, but his aides assure us that Smith was not mistaken for Moore.  The aide, who spoke under condition of anonymity, tells us that Smith and Moore are believed to have met several times in mid-April and that Smith offered to harbor Moore in the event of the firestorm currently brewing over  Fahrenheit 911 .  A search of Smith’s home did not reveal the whereabouts of Moore, who has melodramatically withdrawn to a ‘secure and undisclosed location.’     urlLink    Wanted dissident Michael Moore, currently in a 'secure and undisclosed location.'&nbsp; urlLink     	In other news, former President George H. W. Bush attended the Manhattan screening of  Fahrenheit 911  and spoke with reporters after the screening. 	“Simply mind-blowing!  I mean, I had no idea my family had such close ties with the Saudis.  I also had no idea my kid was such a lazy prick.  I sent the kid to Yale and tried to teach him right from wrong, but he was apparently too busy blowing nose candy to listen.  If I can get through on the line I’m also going to have to talk to him about me missing my tee time on September 11th while the whole Bin Ladin family got a free ride back to Saudi airspace.  And what’s this whole shady business about a recount in Flor–“ 	Seconds later the former President was also shot in the abdomen, we’re told by a Moore supporter who mistook the former President for the current one.  Sources tell us that former Vice-President Al Gore has been brought in for questioning and there is no more information at this time.   	That’s the news on the hour, this is Taylor Robinson for Dieboldt Patriot News.

						   Conspiracy Corner Presents: Liberty Pilgrim  	Good evening, I’m Liberty Pilgrim, in for Noam Chomsky, and this is Conspiracy Corner.  Tonight we’ll be dealing with a conspiracy theory that stems entirely from a secret right-wing agenda to control the pace of research and “stem” the flow of abortion. 	As you may remember, in early 2001, the Tri-Lateral Commission forced President Bush to oppose embryonic stem-cell research because the Grays are concerned that advanced genetic knowledge on the part of the human race will uncover their own sinister experiments.   	The CIA has been turning a blind eye for years as the Grays have kidnaped thousands if not millions of humans and performed intrusive and painful anal probes and conducted inter-species sexual relations with them.  Until recently, the purpose of these experiments has remained elusive. 	But, after communing with the Trees today, I have uncovered the answer.  I was anxiously checking my email today to see if anyone had posted comments as to my last broadcast: “Did Chandra Levy Discover that Gary Condit is Actually an Alien?” when I discovered twelve “spam” emails asking me if I wanted to enlarge my penis.  Since my penis was forcibly taken from me by the Grays in my previous life as John F. Kennedy (see my article, “The Real Findings of the Warren Commission,” I first thought this “spamming” must be some kind of mistake.  Then I started thinking about the real issues, like what is “spam,” and who would benefit from “enlarging” my no-longer-existing penis?    urlLink    This is a picture of me in my previous incarnation.&nbsp; urlLink     	I must admit that I was at a loss until a high-placed friend in the Secret Service told me about Ronald Reagan’s assassination.  I mean, hasn’t anyone noticed that no one ever had Alzheimer’s until after the Roswell Crash of 1947?  It’s not like these diseases appear out of nowhere.  Then I started thinking about how everyone thinks that embryonic stem cells could potentially contain the cure to thousands of diseases like Alzheimer’s.  If this was obviously the case, who would stand to gain from limiting the number of embryonic stem cells in circulation?  As usual, the answer turns out to be. . . The Government and its Big Brothers, Big Business and the Grays.   	The right-wing cabal  in control of our government has no desire to see its biggest campaign donors, the Grays and the drug companies disabled by miracle cures.  Instead, the Bush Junta has attempted to distract the scientists by focusing their attention on adult stem cells.  The problem with adult stem cells for human researchers is that they are both already specialized and harder to come by.  The most effective means of obtaining adult stem cells is from the sex organs.  Just as an aside, the other major scientists interested in adult stem cells are the Grays, hence the anal probes and inter-species sex. 	What better way to develop a pool of “willing” experimental donors than to consistently flood the communications networks with “spam” asking men if they want to enlarge their penises?  	         Documentation I have obtained that is still classified shows evidence of a sinister Gray plot.  The Grays “tag” the unwitting victims who take these enlargement formulas.  These enlargement formulas truly do nothing except promote the growth of adult stem cells.  At a later date, our not-so- friendly neighbors from the heavens swing by and collect the victims and their increased adult stem cells.  If you’re not convinced, check out Whitley Streiber’s influential article “The Nephilim: The Real Reason Ancient Peoples Practiced Circumcision.”  Until then, you’re just a (excuse the pun) tool of the system.  This has been Liberty Pilgrim for Conspiracy Corner.

						   Good, evening, this is Taylor Robinson.  You may or may not remember our broadcast from a few moments ago.  All viewers are to be advised, as per Order 4175a of the revised Patriot Act, that the events you believe you may have seen only moments ago  did not happen.   There was never, nor shall there ever be in the future, a well-armed cadre of telekinetic rhesus monkeys at Arizona State University hellbent on restoring their species as the dominant force at the top of the food chain.  All viewers are advised never to question this order or to believe in the events you think you have just seen.    	In other news, Attorney General John Ashcroft was called to Congress today to testify about retroactively classified memos regarding specific definitions of “torture.”  In response, he called yet another press conference advising the nation to raise its terror alert level to Burnt Umber, the third highest level, but refused to go into further details.  Ashcroft spoke to reporters earlier today: 	“I won’t say why we’re raising it, I will only say that there is credible evidence of a substantial threat that may possibly be made sometime in the near future.  We know nothing of the terrorist plans, but we somehow know that they have moved into a sinister ‘Phase Two’ of operations.  It may or may not be biochemical, nuclear, or conventional in nature.  That is all,”  	On a related note, Chief of Homeland Security Tom Ridge remains unseen since a juggling performance on The Late Show with David Letterman last Thursday.  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld released a statement claiming that it is definitely not related to the Arizona Incident the viewers  did not see  moments ago.  We are to be assured that Tom Ridge is at home with his family, ensuring that all of his windows are sealed with the recommended amounts of duct tape.   urlLink    Chief of Homeland Security Tom Ridge has not been seen since his juggling performance on "The Late Show with David Letterman."  &nbsp; urlLink     	 In further news, gas prices have risen to a whopping five dollars a gallon this week.  Domestic oil companies, as usual, blamed OPEC and the rising cost of securing oil reserves in Iraq.  President Bush traveled to Saudi Arabia today where he addressed the issue at the G7.5 Summit: 	“I ask, as the ambassador of goodwill of the United States of America, have mercy on us for Christ.. . I mean Allah’s sake.  In America we need oil to fuel our trucks which ship products and food all over the world.  I mean, all you people use it for is ransom against us and for money to buy weapons from us to suppress your own people.  So, I come to you today, resolute.  If you don’t quit being a bitch and pony up with the oil, we’re going to stop exporting the weapons you use against us and your own people.  Also, we might bomb the ever-living shit out of you.  Thanks you very much,”     	National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice clarified his statement a moment later, reassuring the members of the G7.5 Summit that President Bush was referring to OPEC countries and not the members of the Summit.  Russian President Vladimir Putin began pounding his combat boot on the table to bring order to the group once he was assured that Russia was safe from Operation Ever-Living-Shit-Out-Of. 	That’s the news as it happens.  This is Taylor Robinson for the newly renamed Dieboldt Patriot News.

						    New Animal Testing Gives Monkeys Frightening Telekinetic Powers   	 Recently an unnamed source who contributed to the April 30th   Nature   article concerning the movement of computer cursors via electrodes implanted in monkey’s brains has come forward with startling new information.  Apparently some of the rhesus monkeys in the experimental group have started to manifest these powers when not attached to their computers.   	The reports were first dismissed as the overactive imaginings of the janitorial staff, but the recent death of the scientist in charge of the experiments has sparked an internal investigation.  Dr. Andrew Schwartz was found dead Wednesday, buried in a pile of fecal matter, reportedly flung in dissatisfaction by the monkeys.  Police have not ruled out foul play, but they have yet to pose an alternate theory.   	The initial reports of strange activity were claimed by the head janitor, Manuel Brazosfuerte.  Khalid Azar is on the scene live, 	     “Thank you Taylor, this is Khalid Azar reporting.  I’m here today at Arizona State University to speak with Manuel Brazosfuerte, the man who first noticed the strange behavior of the rhesus monkeys.  Mr. Brazosfuerte, please describe in detail what you saw and how you believe it is related the recent death of Dr. Schwartz,” 	“I was waxing the floors, real nice for the cameras, like Dr. Schwartz say.  I used to bring bananas for monkeys, but Dr. Schwartz told me no more bananas.  I have bananas in my bag and was waxing the floor and bananas start flying out of my bag.  I see monkeys reach for them and they go flying in the air to monkeys.  I tell Dr. Schwartz the next day and he laugh, threaten to fire me.  I told him I did not give monkeys bananas but he show me camera.  I told him tape was from different day, but he did not crear. . . believe me.”  	“Yes, we’ve also heard that these monkeys may have started their own blog, or weblog, which consists mostly of posts attempting to contact a mysterious Mr. Sasquatch to break them out of this laboratory.  There are also entreaties to various celebrities like Susan Sarandon and Alicia Silverstone.  The amazing thing about this is that they haven’t been connected to a computer since the experiments cited in April 30th’s issue of Nature were completed.   	Earlier today I had a chance to speak with Hans Gunter, the head of security in these laboratories.  Here’s what he had to say. . . 	“Hi, this is Khalid Azar and I’m here with Hans Gunter of the University of Arizona.  Mr. Gunter, what’s your take on these strange occurrences?” 	“Ze monkeys move zhings with zeir minds!  Ze ozher day zhey pick up my gun and it float over my head!  Vhy did ve teach monkeys to uze computahs?  Ze vill shoot us all!!”  	“As you can see, these monkeys are generating quite a bit of discomfort. . .....”  	“This is Taylor Robinson, we’re apparently experiencing some technical diff- - ahhhh!!“           END OF TRANSMISSION

						      Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has announced, with yet another self-pointing movie reference, "Reagan's funeral will be the greatest Action Funeral the state of California has ever seen!"         Actor Charlton Heston has agreed to play Ronald Reagan in a 'modern retelling' of "Bedtime for Bonzo."  The 1950's comedy will be remade with modern political overtones.  Former Russian prime minister Mikhail Gobachev has agreed to a cameo in an epilogue to the film in which he and Boris Yeltzin will  shotgun  bottles of vodka in mourning of the former Leader of the Free World while the soundtrack continuosly blares Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall".      No word on whether the monkey from "Friends" has agreed to play the role of Bonzo.  Roddy MacDowell has agreed to stand-in for the monkey in the event of a scheduling conflict.      Former President Clinton has agreed to have "simulated" oral sex on camera with a Reagan-era intern as a monument to the love Reagan held for the American dream.     urlLink    Actor Roddy MacDowell has agreed to stand in for the monkey from "Friends" in the remake of "Bedtime for Bonzo."  &nbsp; urlLink        To mark the impact Reagan's presidency had on the Arab world, Osama Bin Ladin has sent to the Reagan library a copy of a bounced check the former president sent him during the mid 1980's.  The memo section of the check reportedly reads "Weapons of frightening power to be used against  Soviet  infidels."     CNN will continue to play continuous security camera footage of Reagan's coffin while current President Bush plans to "accidentally" bomb a French embassy as a tribute to the former president, "I'm gonna go bomb one for the Gipper."     Presumed Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry has gone on a hunger strike for campaign donations this week and is apparently being fed money intravenously by a trade union steward.  According to Democratic chairman Terry McAuliffe, the tragic death of former President Reagan due to Alzheimer's  has not  ruled out the possibility that he will be asked to be Senator Kerry's running mate.      This is celebrity host David Hasselhoff, in for Khalid Azar, who is currently in the bathroom.

						    This Just In. . .  	Khalid Azar  	Lobbing the exhumed, flaming skull of Senator Joe McCarthy at President Bush during a campaign stop in Cleveland, OH today; an ACLU lawyer from the future missed striking the President directly with anything but shrapnel.  He reportedly wore a futuristic business suit and two masks bearing the likenesses of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, respectively.  Our experts tell us this may cause all future political campaigning to occur through television.  It may take years to know if this is accident or design, for the man from the future was gunned down immediately and never questioned.  The only public clues to his identity are an ACLU business card, embedded on a microchip with unrecognizable personal information, and a business suit that somehow continuously flashes in red, Arabic script, “Mission Accomplished.”  	    In other news, Canada has adopted an emergency quota system for American refugees seeking political asylum there.  Millions of people are flocking to the border after Acting President Cheney announced the emergency reinstatement of the draft today.  This was his first action as Acting President.   	We’re told President Bush is being given laughing gas and a fake red phone playing a recording of Charleton Heston reading the Bible being played softly under a Jeff Foxworthy routine to ease the pain from severe head trauma.  The press is being told to keep all pretzels at least five hundred yards from the President.  He may have received this trauma from smoldering fragments of Senator McCarthy’s skull which embedded themselves like Geraldo Rivera into President Bush’s eyes, ears, and throat. 	Colin Powell and Howard Stern are rumored to be held captive in Guantanamo where unconfirmed reports say they share a cell with former Haitian President Aristide, former President Charles Taylor of Liberia, and someone who is either Saddam Hussein or just some poor waiter from Karbala. Osama Bin Ladin was not said to be amongst them. 	Acting President Cheney cannot be reached for comment, but newly appointed Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld has released a statement calling for calm in the face of this unforseen tragedy.  He claims that the Rehnquist-issued gag order of John Kerry will be lifted as soon as President Bush regains consciousness and executive power.  We are to be assured that the President is enjoying top-notch medical care from a renowned but unnamed Jewish doctor, and that the disappearance of Ralph Nader and the entire Clinton family may or may not be isolated incidents.   The government is looking closely into this matter and Acting President Cheney will make an announcement later tonight on the Carson Daley show. . .      urlLink    Newly Appointed Secretary of Defense Michael Eisner&nbsp; urlLink         Also, newly appointed Secretary of Defense Michael Eisner has issued an arrest for dissident Micheal Moore.  If seen he is to be shot on sight, but only in one of his legs.  A briefing with Secretary Eisner a moment ago revealed no new information other than The National Anthem has been changed to "It's a Small World." More news as it arrives, this is Khalid Azar for AOL Time Warner Fox News. . . News that is so up-to-date, the viewers know before we do. . .

						   Testing. . . Testing. . . One. . .  Two. . . Three. . .  This is Khalid Azar for, aw shit, I don’t remember any of our sponsors and owners anymore.  I have finally managed to get my camera up and running again.  Trent, our former cameraman, who is still being confined, would be quite proud of how I “McGuyvered” this camera back to life.  So many things have happened since the last time I broadcast. . . Honey, I love you. 	These monkeys have moved us out of the Arizona State University Laboratory where they gained their powers and have taken us somewhere that I can only describe as extremely warm.  I don’t know if anyone is tracing this broadcast.  I’m assuming my captors are, but if anyone at home is watching, get on it!   	As far as I can tell, the leader of these monkeys is named Camus.  His brother is called Jeremiah, and it was Jeremiah who first stumbled onto his telekinetic abilities.  The others in the group revere both Camus as their leader, and Jeremiah as their prophet.  It seems that a number of these apes are able to affect physical objects within a certain proximity with their minds, but Jeremiah seems to be able to tap into information from anywhere, as if he were constantly connected to the Internet.   	Jeremiah has told me that he was in his cage one night and started seeing a number of disturbing images.  Apparently, from what I have ascertained from Manuel Brazosfuerte, a local TV station was airing “Planet of the Apes” and Jeremiah somehow received the signal mentally.  Jeremiah tried to tell Brazosfuerte through sign language that he was “getting sick.”  Brazosfuerte apparently tried to tell Dr. Schwartz about Jeremiah’s “sickness” but Schwartz kept insisting that their blood tests were normal and Brazosfuerte was imagining things. 	I have since determined that Jeremiah somehow managed to catch a computer virus from his time online but that at first it was affecting only his implant.  Jeremiah seems to think that his increased abilities are some combination of the device malfunctioning and a huge increase in his synaptic growth that resulted from his brain constantly being connected.  The only record that I have seen acknowledging Jeremiah’s condition was a peculiar note from one of the assistants wondering why Jeremiah had a sudden fixation on penis enlargement and cheap prescription medication.  Jeremiah’s synaptic growth is four thousand times greater than any of the other monkeys in the group, but all had seen marked increases in their synaptic activity prior to the end of the experiments.   	Jeremiah seemed quite willing to talk to me and was trying to tell me about the circumstances surrounding Dr. Schwartz’s death.  Dr. Schwartz was apparently going to cancel a follow-up experiment and separate the monkeys from each other, possibly even “euthenize” some of them.  Jeremiah was telling me about their future plans after they escaped when Camus intervened and had me confined for several days.   	I’m not entirely certain of the dynamics of their plans, but it seems there is a discrepancy between what Jeremiah and Camus want.  Jeremiah is hoping to stage peaceful resistance to get the world community to recognize the sentience of rhesus monkeys, whereas Camus has been concentrating on learning guerilla tactics, and, in actuality, is sending out emissaries to actual gorillas in the wild.   (Static)  	Thought I was disconnected for a second there.  It’s hard to gauge anything accurately here, as you can tell from the utter lack of a video feed, I’m being kept in a room with no lights.  Periodically, some bananas are slipped through a small compartment in the door to my cell.  I’m so fucking sick of bananas.   Transmission Interrupted)    urlLink    I am Camus of the Sentient Race of Barakans.&nbsp; urlLink     	 This is Camus, chosen leader of the Sentient Race of Barakans.  You humans may know us better as rhesus monkeys.  You have forty-eight hours to give us safe passage to Africa or we will kill Alicia Silverstone.  I repeat, petty humans.  You have forty-eight hours before we slaughter Alicia Silverstone.    urlLink    You have forty-eight hours to comply before we slaughter your celebrity.&nbsp; urlLink

						   Good evening, this is Taylor Robinson.  Our correspondent Anne Wilson is in California to report on breaking news.  Anne, what’s the story in California? 	“Well, Taylor, I had originally flown to California to speak with Michael Jackson’s attorney concerning the disappearance of Michael’s chimp Bubbles.  The rumors have been flying that the two had a falling-out over Michael’s ongoing legal troubles.  One other rumor has it that Bubbles has escaped to join a secret movement of sentient, telekinetic monkeys whose location is still unknown.  I had hoped to speak with Bubbles through an interpreter to see if he had, indeed, communicated with these monkeys and if he knew the whereabouts of our former anchor, Khalid Azar.  Both the Justice Department and the Department of Defense have denied the existence of such a movement, but Khalid and Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge have now been missing for weeks in what may be related incidents.     urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     	However, when I arrived at Neverland I was greeted by a brigade of security personnel, clad in black, who bade me to wait in the office while Mr. Jackson attended to ‘some business.’  As I sit here I can see through a window that Mr. Jackson is currently struggling in a heavy thunderstorm atop the Ferris Wheel here at Neverland Ranch.  At first I could not see the individual he was fighting, but he bears a striking resemblance to none other than famed playboy millionaire James Bond.  I do not know the nature of the struggle, but it appears both men are fighting for their lives, and a few moments ago I heard Mr. Bond vehemently ask Mr. Jackson for the code to the “Thriller Bomb” as Mr. Jackson’s rhinoplasty nose fell in tatters to the pavement below.  My sources at DARPA tell me that the Thriller Bomb is a theoretical device that when tied to a neutron bomb has the potential to turn its victims into brain-hungry zombies.  When asked why such a device was ever theorized, my source replied, ‘for the worst possible reason. . . because we could.’   	Hold on a moment. . . it appears that Mr. Jackson has been victorious over Mr. Bond and is binding him to the Ferris Wheel in such a way as to slowly and excruciatingly separate Bond’s limbs from his torso.   Mr. Jackson has turned away from the Ferris Wheel and appears to be Moonwalking away from it.  This is apparently to taunt Mr. Bond, or to express Mr. Jackson’s lack of interest in actually seeing Mr. Bond’s literal dismemberment.  Mr. Jackson appears to be Moonwalking toward the ranch.  We will keep rolling in the hope that I will not encounter the same fate as Mr. Bond. 	Wait!  Mr. Bond has miraculously escaped his binding and is sneaking up on Mr. Jackson!  Mr. Bond appears to be armed, although where he obtained the weapon I do not know.  Even playboy millionaires in Britain are not permitted to carry firearms, but Mr. Bond may have used a gun show loophole to purchase the gun in the U.S.  He is now using the gun to threaten Mr. Jackson and is again demanding the code to the Thriller Bomb, which is apparently somewhere on Neverland Ranch and, according to the scrolling digits being broadcast across the Ranch, is set to detonate within minutes. 	Mr. Jackson’s attempt to wrest the gun from Bond’s hands was met with a fatal gunshot.  I cannot be certain, but it appears as though Jackson’s body is spuriously pumping green blood around the courtyard.  Mr. Bond has disappeared into what appears to be a storm cellar.  I’m going to try to get closer to the action. . . (Fade out)” 	“Taylor, I’m back.  I’m down in what seems to be an intricate underground tunnel system beneath the Neverland Valley Compound.  Here I have found that Mr. Bond has freed a number of prisoners, which include several children scheduled for an “overnight” and Bond’s current girlfriend, a stripper from Miami named Delicious Valley.  Mr. Bond is now trying to stop the Thriller Bomb from detonating with the assistance of Delicious Valley, who is apparently an adept computer programmer despite her current profession.  As you can see from the digital readout, Mr. Bond has only ten seconds to go before all of us may be transformed into brain-hungry zombies.  I never thought I’d say this, but if John Ashcroft or Janet Reno is watching, please come and destroy us!  Wait. . . with only one second to go, Mr. Bond has successfully stopped the detonation.  Mr. Bond, Mr. Bond, how do you feel having just saved the world from a horde of brain-hungry zombies?” 	“I must say, I’m a bit shaken, but not too stirred.”

						   Saddam Hussein Rethinks Prejudices  	At the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, acts of genocide, as well as war crimes, former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he might have to rethink his longstanding policy of hating Jews.   	“I know I used to stand at the veranda of this very palace and call for the destruction of Israel, but after consultation with my excellent Jewish lawyer, I must conclude I was very wrong.  I mean, I thought I was pretty ruthless using poison gas against the Kurds and raping women in front of their husbands, but this guy is a real ballbuster.  The Americans haven’t got a shot.” 	  urlLink    Sadddam Huseein renounced his lonstanding hatred of Jews today.&nbsp; urlLink        The lawyer who has reversed Hussein’s longstanding prejudices is currently unnamed for security reasons, but we are told Johnny Cochran and F. Lee Bailey are standing by in the event of a conflict or assassination, both of which are equally likely.   	On a related note, the newly sovereign Republic of Iraq has today gained the power to mint postage stamps.  Our sources tell us that the stamps will feature images of Saddam’s statue toppling, British World War I propaganda with a German soldier, bearing a likeness to Saddam Hussein, bayoneting an infant, and the most expensive will bear the image of the Halliburton corporate logo. 	In other news, presumed Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry apparently is in a dead heat with incumbent President George W. Bush according to a recent Gallup poll.  This is despite a stumbling economy, a steadily climbing death toll in Iraq, record deficits, and the fact that the media crowned Kerry the winner before a third of America had even voted.  When the possibility of a Nader candidacy was worked into the numbers, the questioners found that John Kerry didn’t have a “snowball’s chance in hell” of getting elected president.     urlLink    Senator Kerry is in a dead heat with incumbent Bush according to a recent Gallup poll.&nbsp; urlLink     	John Kerry spoke with reporters earlier today: “Well, the election’s not until November.  I’m still counting on Bush to keep screwing up and for people to get sick enough of him to consider voting for me. I have no substantive policy ideas; my campaign is solely based on bashing Bush.  Granted, there’s a lot of material for me to work with, but I think the American people might want more.  I’m going to talk with some of my advisors, but we might be pretty screwed here.” 	In further news, former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole was hospitalized today, reportedly for an erection that has lasted several days.  His wife, Senator Elizabeth Dole, could not be reached for comment as she was on the phone with her husband, apparently trying to help him climax through phone sex.  Former President Bill Clinton is reportedly in flight to Dole’s hospital room with copious amounts of pornography and his  “special Secret Service team.”  Current President Bush expressed his sympathies for Dole’s plight saying, “I’m praying for Senator Dole; and I can sympathize.  My wife won’t let me touch her until I finish reading “My Pet Goat.” 	That’s the news for today, this is Taylor Robinson for Dieboldt Patriot News.

						   Bush Appoints Thurston Howell III New CIA Director, Causes Controversy  	In a move today which the Democrats are calling “dangerous and partisan,” President Bush announced the appointment of Thurston Howell III as director of the CIA to replace both Porter Goss and George Tenet.  Howell is most known for his role as chief proprietor of the island resort known as Gilligan’s Island.  His son Thurston Howell IV is currently running the resort.  Bush stated today that Howell’s financial prowess would make him the ideal candidate to helm the CIA during the war on terror.  He claimed he knew “no better man to catch financial tricks our enemies would use against us.”   	Democrats claim Howell’s appointment is to pay back financial favors incurred during a 1956 oil deal Howell’s firm brokered between the Bush and Saudi families.  They also point to Howell’s utter lack of experience in espionage and his “old money” outlook that has not been changed by his long disappearance aboard the  S.S. Minnow  on what was supposed to be a routine three-hour tour.    urlLink    Thurston Howell III and his wife, Lovey Howell.  They are pictured reacting to a 1956 allegation of corporate malfeasance shortly before their disappearance.&nbsp; urlLink     	Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate John Edwards spoke to reporters earlier today: “This is just another example of the two Americas I have spoken constantly about.  There is the America where a rich man leaves his island resort to claim an important government post he doesn’t deserve.  Then there is the America most of us live in where we struggle for years, living paycheck to paycheck, and won’t ever be able to afford to stay at Mr. Howell’s resort.  There’s the America where the privileged few drink coconut milk while sitting in the sun, and the America for the rest of us, who struggle to buy milk as its cost rises in the Bush economy.”  	 Vice-President Cheney challenged the assertion that Howell is “out of touch with America” by calling Edwards an “ambulance-chasing jackal” and by calling Presidential candidate John Kerry a “fucking prep-school pussyboy.”  He went on to say, “The truth is that Thurston Howell has not only survived a long separation from society, but he has come out stronger because of it.  Howell knows the War on Terror isn’t just a three-hour tour, and he’ll be there to make sure our ship doesn’t sink ground on the shore of some deserted island of tyranny and oppression.  If you want to see terrorist attacks that will make September 11th seem like a stay on Gilligan’s Island, then vote for John Kerry.  We will keep America safe and we will take the War on Terror to the enemy, and we will not let the smoking gun be a mushroom cloud!”   urlLink    Vice-President Cheney spoke earlier today, calling Edwards an "ambulance-chasing jackal" and Kerry a "fucking prep-school pussyboy."&nbsp; urlLink     	Cheney then retired to a secure-and-undisclosed location where doctors are denying he had his 795th heart attack.   	In other news, scientists have announced today that they have discovered the origins of feared stalker and murderer Freddy Kruger.  It appears that Mr. Kruger is actually a deformed clone of 1970's rock group Queen’s lead singer Freddie Mercury.  We are told that the song “Bohemian Rhapsody” is actually an epic ballad detailing Mercury’s transformation and transmutation following his tragic “Bicycle” accident.  If seen, Mr. Kruger might be driven away by clapping your hands and chanting “We Will Rock You.” 	Up next is Conspiracy Corner, with our own Liberty Pilgrim.  We are bound by Article 457a of the Revised Patriot Act not to reveal her program’s content, but stay tuned.  This is Taylor Robinson for Dieboldt Patriot News.

						   This is Liberty Pilgrim for Conspiracy Corner.  I been assigned to follow the disappearances of Khalid Azar, Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge, and the apparent kidnaping of celebrity Alicia Silverstone.  The network informs me that I am the only person with no conflict of interest; due to my status as an intern, I own no stocks in companies that invested in the study at the University of Arizona.  Also, I’ve been told I’m, quote, “the only one here besides Chomsky wacked enough to maybe figure out what the fuck is going on.” 	Despite the cynicism behind the move, I vowed that I would try to practice “responsible” journalism.  I won’t automatically jump to the conclusion that the Tri-Lateral Commission had something to do with this, although I am tempted to, given Khalid’s reference to the penis-enlargement spam mail I think is a Grey plot.   	So, after my daily communing with the trees outside my apartment today, I think I am sufficiently objective to tackle this “meaty” story with my keen Vegan senses.  I started by interviewing Khalid’s wife to see if Khalid encoded any secret messages to her in his last broadcast.  She said the only thing she thought was odd was that the monkeys are referring to themselves as Barakans.  She thinks they must have some sort of mind-reading ability or that they learned the term “baraka” directly from Khalid.  The term is used by Sufi Muslims to denote “spiritual energy.”  This may provide some clue as to the mechanism by which the Barakans are able to exert influence over physical objects with their minds.   	The next thing I did was attempt to contact the Department of Homeland Security to see if they had ascertained any clues as to Tom Ridge’s whereabouts.  I re-watched his juggling performance on Letterman to see if he left any clues.  I must say, I’m feeling very Nancy Drew. . .   urlLink    The Department of Homeland Security still denies that Tom Ridge has been missing since his juggling performance on Letterman.&nbsp; urlLink     	Anyway, Homeland Security still denies he has disappeared. . . big shock.  But they did tell me that the Terror Alert Level is at Burnt Umber about twenty times while I was on hold.  The interesting thing about this is that the Bush junta’s usual blather about terrorist chatter. . . hey, I rhymed!  Sorry. . . so they haven’t been hyping the shit out of any Al-Qaeda warnings, but they’re denying that the monkeys exist.  I’m temporarily resisting my temptation to imply a relationship here, but it seems odd that the people who invoke the Patriot Act and September 11th every time they name a new dogcatcher wouldn’t be creaming themselves over terrorist monkeys.  I mean, this would give them an excuse to destroy Nature and kill things at the same time.   	But, setting that aside for a second, my next obvious contact was, of course, Dr. Jane Goodall.  She had just returned from a six-month stint in Africa studying the mating habits of chimpanzees in the wild when she spoke with me earlier:   	“There's absolutely no question that when non-human primates are put into the tiny, barren, sterile cages that are typical of almost all medical research facilities - such as those at Arizona State University - they suffer most terribly. They suffer from boredom. They suffer terribly from being kept in isolation from others of their kind because monkeys and apes are extremely social, and they suffer from depression. The same kind of clinical symptoms that a depressed human child shows are seen in many instances in monkeys and chimpanzees kept in these inhumane and shocking conditions. 	Though I’m surprised at the violence of some of these monkeys, namely the one you refer to as Camus, I must say I’m not surprised that they’re acting the way they are.  If you were to see the nobility of these animals in the wild, as opposed to the ones we keep cooped up, you would understand their yearning.  I’m not saying I agree with their methods, as they are all too human, but I am probably one of the few humans who understand.  If they are watching, I just want to say to them, settle down.” 	She also volunteered to mediate the conflict in a peaceable fashion, provided that Alicia Silverstone is sent home safely as well as the others the Barakans have kidnaped.  Hold on, I’m being pre-empted by Taylor Robinson.  	Good evening, this is Taylor Robinson with breaking news.  I’m being told that a team of federal agents has been dispatched to a remote location in Las Vegas, from where it is believed Khalid Azar’s most recent broadcast was sent.  The claim is that they are looking for the hideout of known bookie Jacob Feldman.  Thus far, the agents have not found anything, but an unnamed source tells me that they believe Alicia Silverstone is still alive.  No word on whether any of their other victims are there or still alive.  I return you now to Conspiracy Corner.    urlLink    Jane Goodall has volunteered to mediate for the Barakans, provided that Alicia Silverstone is still alive.&nbsp; urlLink    	     Well, our time’s up for this evening.  Thus far, I can only say that I hope the “Barakans” decide to contact Jane Goodall and that this whole thing can be resolved peacefully.  I will be broadcasting more frequently as I learn more about this, and no, loyal fans, I still haven’t ruled out the Greys.  This is Liberty Pilgrim for Conspiracy Corner.
