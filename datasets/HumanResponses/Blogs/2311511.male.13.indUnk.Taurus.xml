       Hello everybody right now I'm directing,producing and co writing a Kung Fu movie right now we are in the writing and planing fase but it's going to be called "The Five Emeralds Of The Evil Cat"  it sounds stupid but it will probably much stupider than the title.Don't worry I will definately alert you when my movie comes out and then you loyal readers can buy it on DVD from me over somehow on the net like ebay or e-mail or possibly by my website if I have mine up and running by then .Just to tell you I first got the insperation for my movie because of the T.V. show Kid Notorius and the fact that my best friend has an evil geinius cat who tried to kill me by biteing my right temple.Goodbye for now "yall"

       I just read that horrible story about that poor man who's blog was discovered by his mother . I don't know if I could function if my ma saw my blog even with just 4 posts I find this story devistating there shoud be a ban of mothers reading there kid's blogs I could call it the anti-snooping mother act of 2003 . Oh yea I would like to tell you about a comeidian that I found out about and he is great his name is Bill Hicks if you like political humor but not like Ronald Regan political humor like anti-establishmetal comedy . Also here are some great web comics sinfest.com , joyoftech , mega tokyo and little gamers just to warn you these comics should only be used in an even of a crash over water .

       I am back once again I just want to say that I hate the parent council at my school they are god damn retards that couldn't pull there head out of there asses for a single second to see what the students want and the reason I say this is because they canceled our class trip to Montreal the greatest city in the world It's Las Vagas , paris and the worlds largest smoking lounge all rolled up into one and those ass holes  took away all the funding for the trip but technicaly they didn't cancel it but if one person can't pay $600 per person we can't go and I'll tell you there are 34 kids in my class and it is bound that one of them will not be able to pay!!!!! Now for an update on my film we have started casting parts and we have found a few that will work for really cheap.Right now though I am looking for some good mac movie editing software because I fear I movie will not be powerful enough.If you want to give me some good sugestions just e-mail me at eprime666@hotmail.com and you might want to checkout my friend's blog at www.18thcenturypimp.blogspot.com he's the co director and co writer of the film and just to update you I have changed from director to co director and I'm still producer and trying to live the Robert Evans lifestyle , well atleast as far as my mom will let me . Thank you and good bye

       Hello readers you may think from my first post this blog would just be about my movie but it's about my opinions I just want some publicity for my movie. So this post will be about my opinions and in future if anything big happends in the production I will update you but until then it will be about my opinions and stuff like that. Now I would like to say something about the drug rate in the states you guys (I say you guys because I'm Canadian) must have the highest heroin , crack and cocain rate in the world I mean look at the facts you elected G.W. Bush  , Richard Nixon , Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter I mean the man said he was attacked by a KILLER RABBIT does this man just think the world is one big Montey Python skit or something. Those were actualy the stuff you guys did that wasn't that stupid now if  you want stupid two words Arnold Shwartenegger. I better stop goofing on your politicians now because the  FBI has probably already send a dark van out for me, good bye.

       Hey sorry I wanted to post on Friday but my net connection was down for a bit but anyway blogman is here once again dum da dum . I'm not sick anymore if I didn't say so before so ya I'm back and ya . I just went out for a burger but it wasn't that great and I'm kinda depressed because I'm not old enough to see kill bill but I think my dad might be cool with me seeing it so I'll ask him when he gets back from his business trip and we can go see it when were Christmas shopping for my mom . Right now I'm trying to see if natural soda is as good normal soda so I can think that I'm doing something good for my body as my teeth are being ripped out by my dentist Dr.cloth or better know in some circuits as Mr. hied . I want to tell you that the cola is pretty good for natural but it tastes like someone put an unlit cigarette in it and took it out really fast but it still is pretty good I'll notify you when I try the lemon lime I'll be trying that in about a half an hour or a hour . Oh I have a message to bubble gum pop "artists" that are trying to be samantha Fox here is what you do make a girl on girl sex tape that " accidentally" is released to the public then go to India and find the joys of hashish and come back and collaborate with jimmy Page on a real album . Good bye

       Hey  it's me it's official I'm sick and I got to stay home today I have a fever of 38 degrees Celsius which is actually not that high but it's still a fever and according to a rule at my school a child cannot be sent to school and remain there if he or  she has a fever this is the only good rule at my school . I thought I wouldn't go to school yesterday but I pushed my self and I got rewarded , I didn't have to go to swimming at school ! Oh I'm sorry I have yet to mention how much I hat swimming well I like swimming but I hate swimming at school I don't know why but I think it has something to do with the fact that one swimming class is  like 18 weeks of intense boot camp training for the marines not that it's even a class because they never teach us anything new they just work us and work us until the pool is red with blood like some scene from "Jaws" . Those swim teachers torture us so much I'm afraid that the next time I go to pool I'll end up having electrodes stuck to my testicles and my eyes pried open to be brain washed by North Korean propaganda. Now I would like to say something about a new fad I found out about in blogs playing dead , what you do is you post a picture of your self on your blog pretending to be dead but the real trick is to find a creative and original death . I usual don't follow fads but I think this is really cool so around Christmas when I'll get my new digital camera I'm going to make one I haven't thought of the exact death but I'm thinking some where along the lines of a vomit induced death like choking on my own vomit or vomiting up my organs or actually if I wanted to make it simple I could just do a simple drug overdose . Oh well I'll figure it out good bye "folks"

       hello I'm back once again to tell you about my life . I think I'm getting a cold I started to reallize this at about 10:30 last night when I was watching Unscrewed with Martin Sarget . I'm not sure if it was a cold or just the side effects of the three cokes I had about a half hour before though I did feel a little screwed up in the morning more than usual anyway. Well goodbye I better lie down now so I can convince my mom that I can't go to school tomorrow

       Hello everybody and good day to you loyal readers and first timers I am your leader and I would like to apologize for my weekend post it sucked ass but for those who's lives suck worse than  mine here's my review of natural lemon lime soda well I tastes like watered down mountain dew and ass though I have never tasted ass it was what I imagined ass would taste like so don't buy it . Oh yes I forgot because of my friends stupidness I must correct him he runs a blog and he said that family guy will be returning to the air and in one of the last lines he writes that it's the first series to be renewed but the original Star Trek was prematurely canceled and then NBC was flooded with letters and phone calls urging them to put it back on the air and they did so if I am not mistaken but because I haven't had a chance to talk to him about it so I don't know if he meant in FOX history or what ever but I would like to correct him . So he can thank me for taking his ass slack much like some kind of ass bra but I am much more than an ass bra , I do breasts to but seriously I will hold your breasts anyway I am also an invaluable fountain of tech news well here it is  Mozilla is launching a e-mail client a web browser merged together with a web browser , well don't worry it won't be like Netscape's communicator well I can really only guess that but you know it's Mozilla so it's probably good . Okay now let's play some hard ball and I'm ah hell I got nothing we might as well just play T-ball . Now I'm starting to Christmasfy my computer  you know screen saver wallpaper stuff like that . Well I guess that's all I have to say  oh accept have a happy and fun holiday and fight those establish monkey bastards but mostly the first on and the second one. Bye

       Today in class they showed us a film that was an amazing classic and no I am not talking about Deep throat in sex ed but I'm talking about inherit The Wind in English class it was an amazing film about the scopes monkey trial . It has the guy from Bewitched and the second colonel from M*A*S*H* and it also has in a small cameo of the guy who played Mr. Roper from three's company . The only draw back of having a movie is that my teacher will always assign something to do with the movie . Now I'm going to publish my top 5 lists first my top 5 movies (not in any order) The graduate , M*A*S*H* , Office space , War games & inherit The Wind    top 5 bands : Led Zepplin , The Doors , The Clash , Pink Floyd & Devo  top 5 babes : Debra Harry(when she was young) , Live Taylor , Paris Hilton , Samantha Fox (when she was young) & that babe from weird science ( when she was young  thanks and bye

       I have confirmed that my teacher ( Mr. Fraser ) was an idiot when he was a kid . This coclusion is based on the fact that when he was a kid he licked a metal pole in winter . I think these findings speak for them selves . I just got to chapter 5 of 1984 and now I know what double think is but I'm not going to tell you what it means so  you'll either read the book or die or just be really uncomfortable because I'm going to use it and you'll be lost and kind of annoyed . Double think double think double think double think double think double think . Nothing much happened this weekend except I downloaded a bunch of songs and didn't go out like a hermit well a hermit with a satellite dish , computer and six pack of coke . Well my site of the post is ipodlounge.com it's all ipod all the time . Well that's all for me Bitch!!!!!

       In response to a post made by the person who posts the blog Kentucky Fried Cow and chicken in which he or she said that in Canada we have only one road so we are bound to have atleast one collage well I'm going to have to tell you off you yank bastard my fist choice school may be Yale but my second choice is Megil's in Montreal which I must say if you are going to go to a collage in Canada go there because of all the strip clubs and you can smoke where ever you want like in Toronto hell the smoking laws are so strict that I don't even smoke and they annoy me . So I must say that on behalf of the Canadian people either get drafted or finish of collage in Canada P.S. The legal drinking age here is 19 not 21 so come and suck down some beers and smoke a couple packs .

       Hello everybody I now realize that I've been treating my Blog like a TV show but I now realize how obnoctios that is so I'm just going to treat it as a normal blog . On Sunday I had to go to lunch with my little cousins which actually wasn't to bad but it was funny because I woke up about noon and as soon as I get up my mom tells me that we're going to lunch with my cousins so I thought well I guess it's not to bad but I don't realize that it's noon so she says get dressed and I'm wondering why we were going so early because I estimated that it was about 9 or 10 o'clock and well I suppose you have to be there . I did find that the guy who posts Kentucky fried cow and chicken is actually pretty smart he is a front runner in a cause that I find very interesting which is using emoticons to end sentences as opposed to a period when your using an emoticon  e.g. I like cheese :-) . Would be changed to . I like cheese :-) well I have found that I kinda like 80's pop not like Paula abdul but like nena you know 99 red balloons . Tomorrow I'm going to get a hamster I'm not really sure how that connects to 80's pop but meh . Another thing last Wednesday "officer Frank" came to our school to talk to us about drugs he was how I would describe as exremly over dramatic by the end of the talk I thought he was having an epileptic seizure with all the hand waving and such . Anyway we got to see real drugs incased in plastic which was cool because I didn't know how small LSD was well I guess that's good news I always did have trouble swallowing pills . Bye you retards oh sorry bye you mentally challenged persons :-)

       The hand is an amazing thing able to grab and crush with amazing power but able to cradle the most gentile and smallest things it can even take a whole bodies force for hand stands . That's beside the point if you don't think this is worth reading don't tell your friends that tell them to read it please if there is even anybody reading it tell people apparently no one wants to be my enemy . C'mon tell people to read it  I invented a new word soupgold it's the rewards countries that are big get by "helping" little countries like America's soupgold for helping Iraq would be oil . See it are fun to use . I realize that living vicariously through a 11 year old might not be fun but it could be . Oh if you don't want to I don't care screw you you don't have to read it just tell people about it let them decide . Anyway have you heard little Bill's little plan yes I am referring to my enemy and yours Billy Gates well he wants to force everybody to change to a new standard he's doing this by making hotmail inaccessible if you don't switch this will be terrible if a small bushiness cannot comply * cough juggernaut * now I heard this by one ear when I had tech TV on in the background so my facts may not be so very true so if there are any incorrect facts that you see feel free to e-mail me at eprime666@hotmail.com and I'll correct it .

       people I'm not finishing my own anarchist manifesto because I found that the socialisim that they were talking about is means of production e.g. land , mines , offices or large tools like bull dosers and such not the actual product so you can have your own shit but you can't become a corporate jugernaut with big stores and mines and stuff . thank you and good bye

       "What is Anarchy?  "Freedom without Socialism is privilege.  Socialism without Freedom is Tyranny"  Anarchism is the most misunderstood of political philosophies, perhaps because it threatens both the established order and those who would become our new masters after we have overthrown it.  Anarchists are constantly having to deny the images of them presented by both Left and Right.  Taken in by these lies or suffering from their own preconceptions, few bother to investigate the reality.  With this in mind we have put together this summary of what we do believe.   Anarchists seek to maximize freedom for all. We believe all people should be as free as possible to determine their own destinies and activities within the limits required by a respect for the equal rights of others.  This freedom should actual and practical, unhindered by unnecessary legal prohibitions or material constraints.   Anarchists are opposed to authority and hierarchy. All persons must be considered as equals.  No-one has the right to coerce or expect obedience from others except where necessary to protect the equal rights of others.   Anarchists are opposed to patriarchy. As a coercive set of social relations based on gender hierarchy, patriarchy oppresses and silences women in ways that we are as yet not even fully conscious.  Patriarchal structures must be destroyed wherever they are recognised.   Anarchists are not opposed to organisation. Anarchy is about organisation. It is about co-operation amongst equals, free of oppressive power relations. Often a lack of organisation allows oppression to go unnoticed and merely offers the "liberty" of the strong to take advantage of the weaker.  We must organise to prevent this.  We are opposed, however, to types of organisation which are based on authority and hierarchy or which involve the unnecessary regimentation and subordination of individuals or which strangle individual creativity.  We are implacably opposed to the centralisation of power.   Anarchists believe in the necessity of *direct democracy*. Where disagreements exist amongst persons which cannot be resolved co-operatively, the will of the majority must be respected.  Consensus decisions are always the ideal but when a consensus cannot be reached then democratic procedures must be employed.  Considering peoples as equals requires this. Representative and Parliamentary democracy are frauds which separate the government from the people, deny us control over our own lives and encourage apathy amongst the citizenry.  Real democracy places power in the hands of the people by making all decisions at the lowest possible level by voting in workplace and community councils.   Anarchists seek the destruction of the State. The State, a government which holds itself to be separate from and above the people, is always an oppressor. It has its own interests: its natural form is a bureaucracy and the military, the police and the security forces are its weapons.  "Control" of the state is an illusion which corrupts all revolutionaries.  We will not be free while the State exists   Anarchists believe in the need for a total Revolution. There is no aspect of the existing evils, Capitalism, Patriarchy and the State, that we can afford to leave intact if we seek to build a world free of oppression.  Like cancers these structures will reappear and destroy freedom if they are not sought out where- ever they are manifest and destroyed utterly and simultaneously.  Because our goals are radical, involving the total overthrow of the existing order, we cannot hope to accomplish them  by reformist means within that order.   Anarchists deny the distinction between ends and means. Liberation and revolution are our activities not our ends.  For this For this reason we will never be able to achieve freedom through authoritarian methods or destroy the State by seizing control of it.   Anarchists follow no leaders. No-one can lead us to take responsibility for our own lives.  Only we can liberate ourselves. The only "leadership" we recognise is by example.   Anarchists believe in a brighter future. We envisage a future free of oppression, of people living in community and in control of their own lives. We see a society governing itself though workplace and community councils, making decisions at the lowest possible level and cooperating and organising together.  We believe in a society where "economic" decisions about production and distribution which affect all of us are made democratically rather than left in the hands of a privileged and unelected few.  Free of the destructive imperatives of capitalism, we will be able to live in harmony with the environment, use technology to our own advantage rather than our bosses and escape from the threat of war derived by the needs of Capital and State to extend their influence.  We will build our own future.   Anarchists know that it can work. We gain strength from the examples of anarchist revolutionaries at the forefront of progressive movements throughout history.  We learn from the Spanish Civil War where peasants and workers seized control of large areas of Spain and organised them according to anarchist principles.  We learn from other existing anarchist organisations and from our own experiences as we attempt to put anarchist theory into practice in our own lives."   this is all what I believe but there was a part that I left out about anarchy being socialism kind of so I want to say that what I believe is this and not the other stuff so I will say I'm reformed anarchist and I will complete the reformed anarchist manifesto in my next posts or two

       Hey everybody I just watched the episode of M*A*S*H where colonel Blake was killed and I must say no matter how many times I see that I am tempted to cry but then I realize that it's just a tv character but it still is sad because that show had some of the best tv writers ever . It's always presented creatively and well writen and flowing not matched by any show I've seen .

       I know I haven't been posting for a while but I was making my site www.freewebs.com/evantoon it is all about my cartoons that I do and there is also my class site that I'm helping with but I won't release the url until it's done . We got our parts for the play last week I'm judge collins the cold judge who wants to kill criminals for minor infractions and I'm also Lysander (which is a bigger role than Collins) who is love struck because of a fairly love potion (if you want to know more just look for the play mid summer night's dream) this play is a compilation of a bunch of plays so you wont be able to read it if you want to .

       Hey everybody it's 12:55 on sunday and I still haven't memorized all my lines but don't worry I only have 9 more and they are small . Last night on MSN I went insane on a girl that we were doing the site with because she put something that could come across ant-semetic on her page , but it wasn't the comment it was the fact that when Eli and I found out about it I deffended her because Eli wanted to take it out because he was Admin even when I thought that she was a racist 100 percent (now I'm only about 20 percent sure she's racist) because of free speech which I beleive in to the extent of getting killed but it sparked something inside me when I deffended her oppinion that freedom could be to free but then I just decided what I always decided that everybody even blaton racist have to have freedom to speak their minds . It can't be that freedom is for the only ones who agree with people .                                                                                                                  good bye and this little experiment of world government with Eli playing the dictator is running me ragged and on that note that's why anarchy works

       I just learned som HTML and well I recomend you don't fool around with the archive section because I'm pretty sure I just deleted my whole archives which is bad for those new readers (ya right I'll be lucky if there are any readers) but I will say that I'm just a 12 year old who is writing a blog about their life so when they find me dead they'll have something to pry out of my cold dead hands I'm not sure if the blog is still archiving and collection the info . Since I know a little HTML now (stress little) I'll be putting a counter on and maybe pictures if I can but don't worry now I'll be able to improve my other sites because frankly there isn't much you can do with html on a free blog exept change colours make links and stuff but maybe my blog won't suck now (I doubt it)

       hello everybody for the last past couple of weeks or so there has been this girl from Mr.Fraser's(my teacher) past class to help us with the play and I just kind of realized today that I have a little crush on her . I'm pretty sure she's a junior in high school and I know I have no chance but c'mon she's amazing she has these green streaks in her hair and she always wares these great punk t-shirts and she has a pair of doc martins so she's not only a punk but a real punk not those poser punks who like good charlotte well I actualy don't know her musical preferance but I'm pretty sure she's actual punk .

       I changed my links and now I didn't put my cartoon site up because I'm saying fuck off to it and starting clean . So by the end of this weekend you should have a new link in all of your repituars . I took an IQ test , well actualy a couple of them and I'm averaging a 122 to 123 IQ which if you didn't know is good is above average and boarderline gifted but unfortunately I'm not a genius I am very intelligent but not a genius . The crush on the assistant teacher is about fading I still think she's hot but any real fealings are gone so thats a message to you Alison,stefani and the rest of the class I don't have a crush on her anymore :p up yer's . Oh ya today's my birthday I actualy am 12 now because as soon as its april I start saying I'm 12 just to tell you so you know I wasn't 12 when you thought I was .

       well for the last while I've been following anarchisim like a religeon and wondering if I should buy things because it would be so capitalistic but now I have come to the conclusion that if I want something I'll buy it . Anarchisim is not about following ruels it's about doing whatever the fuck you want because the government has no right to tell you what to do . It's not about being a minimalist because you are wondering if you'd be a hipicrate if you want something . We got new seating arangments for my class and now I'm in the direct line of fire between Stefani and Alison who talk insane amounts but I guess it's ok I really don't care .

It's kind of disrupting me in class because whenever one of the girls in my class pulls out a stupid pop magizines near me I go into convolsions . good bye oh and if you didn't get it tnod etov means dont vote

       well I made a promise today that because of stomach pains I would bitch about it to anyone I came in contact with so I thought this would the ultimate wyning machine so now my stomach hurts uhhhh its like a bunch of knives sticking into me uhhhh . there I'm done ok now I want to say that because a bunch of people in my class have seen My blog they are joking at me for the crush on the high school girl but all I hope is that she doesn't find out because it was fine when some girls in my class knew they just made some stupid joke and that was the end of it but now that some of the guys (dickless retards) know it I think they actualy might tell her that I have a crush on her which would make it uberuncomfortable and the worse thing is that we have this other girl in our class with the same name and when they first hear it they think it's her and thats embarasing . (I really shouldn't have given those whores my blog url then this wouldn't have happend)

       well I was staying up late as I always do on saturday nights last night and I noticed that they were doing a little show on Much Music that was called much in your space where they give the person and the person's room a makeover so it fits the theme of their favourite band which in this case was good charlotte ,now if you have read my blog before you probably noticed I said some bad stuff about good charlotte well I want to quote someone one much that I actualy agree with to explain my point "Is this what punk has come to ya know they ask why no one ever notices superman behind clark kent's glasses well I want to know how do people not notice the Backstreet boys behind a layer of mascera" - Ed the sock now all I want to say is AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate Avril Lavene because she's a poser of the skater culture well I hate the skater culture and when there are posers of the punk culture that I really like well I'm tempted to lose it . On the show they dressed the guy up in a Ramones T-shirt WHAT!?!!?!? how retarded is that the closest good charlotte ever came to the ramones was when one was dating a girl with a leather jacket now c'mon when are we going to pull the wool away from our eyes and say hey get off the stage you pussy posers . This is exactly like creed imitating Pearl Jam exept this is worse creed actualy had their own style and just butchered the music a bit but these guys butchered the culture to what was expected of punk and then used that image to make crappy music that sounds like your garden veriety rock/pop . From now on any one who likes good charlotte then don't count your self as punk count your self is conformist little terd . The punk movement is about being your self and being an individual and not being exepted ,and by the by just because you are a good charlotte punk doesn't mean you are an anarchist if I see a god damn little poser punk bitch putting an anarchy symblol on something and not knowing what it means well I'll cry then slit my wrists . These stupid retards are going to drive me to spill blood

       well I am a anarchist and well I would like to say on behaf of my self and any other anarchist out there that are like me that just because liberals are more free doesn't mean that we are like liberals infact I would say I have a more conservitive veiw of the world and just because liberals and anarchist beleive that everyone should be equal then that doesn't mean that they are like us anymore than republicans that beleive we shouldn't pass bills protecting the environment because anarchy is freedom and equality and I hate facist conservitives but I hate facist liberals to that want to be politicly correct and censor everyone . You see conservitives get a bad rap just because everyone sais to ,I would take a true inteligent facist conservitive over an ignorant conformist liberal any day I might not agree but atleast I would respect them . I object to Bush because I actualy know that he's a gun toating idiot that can't take any critisizim of his administration and that to every problem his responce is "Nuke'm" Iraq "Nuke'm" Afganistan "Nuke'm" Econemy "Nuke'm" well you get the idea I hate him all because of this not because charlie sheen tells me that Bush is a poopoo head . I want to clear up that though I am not a pacifist I hate war its the most retarded thing anyone can sent people to do ESPECIALY when they have never been to war them selves (if you can't tell Bush over your yells of "Nuke'm" that I am talking about YOU) I just hate conservitves because they are the closest to having church and state joined and hating abortion and I'm an athiest I'm not denying my personal beleifs influence but I think that I am the one with the clearest vision so I want to say : Let the Queens get married (sorry if your gay and you don't like the word queen but its my way of hating the censoring liberals and the facist conservitives) let the bitches kill the babies and Fuck the church! so to recap hating religous extremist Conservitive and politicaly correct Liberals who censor so just shut up I hate you all!!!!!!! Liberal or Republican you can all join in hands and say that I hate you ! so don't label me as a more extreme Liberal I'm an ANARCHIST , Ta Ta

       I'm branding Donald Rumsfeld a war criminal personally on the grounds that he knew all this torcher was happening but refused to aknowlage it because he didn't want to lose support in Iraq so I will officially call for his resignation and hopefully he will peacefully step down because of my wishes but I will also request a indepth investigation into not only these atrocities but possible other war crimes committed by the U.S. I will make up a list of UN inspectors and investigators to look into this and I must say the only good thing that came from these terrible events perpetrated by the U.S. on the Iraqi people is the light that it sheds on America's "good guy" persona to find the real position . Hopefully the government won't "pencil whip" these events out of the world's eye . Good bye   (pencil whip means to use the position of power one holds to dismiss charges that they have committed )

       Eli again. I was with a friend yesterday and while we were playing ball hockey his ex was walking donwn the road. First she was with her sriends and they were laughing lie crazy. And she yelled " hey there hot stuff*  to him .we ran as fast as we good to my house. I went outside to check if they were gone.And they were. So we continued with the game. Later though they walked bythe road again still laughing like mad and we didnt have tyme to run. They yelled all these stupid coments and couldnt walk in a straight line. It was obvious that they are underage drinking. Stupid underage drunkies.  Well anyways in our class not that much has happened. Exept I asked Alison out. She said no. She only goes with people she likes.

       well stef isn't mad at me anymore well atleast not as mad as before . Today I was on Queen street west and used some birthday money to buy about $20 worth of comics (I want to be one of those guys that spends all their cash on comics,beer and art zines)and I also baught some art supplies and the kill bill sound track I'm listening to it now and it kicks ass . I got scar face for my birthday and my freinds dad was all nerotic about giving it to me as a present because well thats how he generaly is he gets worked up about almost every little bit of "inaproprietness" . I was watching last nights episode of saturday night live and it was really funny y'know Lisnsey Lohan is actualy not such an uptight little goody goody like in one sketch it was about harry potter when hermioni comes back to hogwarts and she has big boobs from over the summer and harry and uhh....what ever the fuck the other guy's name was kept drooling over her it was sooooo funny .

       well it looks like I have been kicked out of the class blog "The Wall" it's either that or sometime last night when I was half over caffienated and half exosted I got angry because I didn't understand quantum physics right away then deleted it but that one doesn't seem very likly mostly because I can understand the principals of quantum physics . I think I might start a knew blog a fake one just in case my parents start looking for one like my dad he's pretty tech savy and I know that if I have a blogger bookmark he's going to get suspicious so I could dangle in in the wide open kinda and then he'll  just say oh look at that my son knows some html thats good and think nothing more of it but if they find this thing it's going to be like balisticsville man because those squares are going to come down on my buzz . now goodbye all you cool cats and catettes

       I was thinking about if I went on a vacation for while and couldn't blog which person would I get to guest post on it . I know that it wouldn't be any of my freinds because they would either not post regularly or just say stupid random shit "like yum yum bumm cheese" . So I started looking at other bloggers like the girl who has been posting comments here but her blog is waaaaaay better than mine and even having her post comments here is amazing and there are other blogs but most of them are either way better or are good but not like mine . Of course the very fact of having a guest blogger is a bit weird I mean it's supposed to be all about my life . Yknow what I'll think about the guest thing but I'll probably just end up using audioblogger . 81 81

       yknow I don't think I have put anything on the class site since like emmanuel (a retard jerk ass homo in my class) broke into it and I had to change the pass and rag on him on my page . I can't beleive we actualy thought that site was good . It's kind of sad one minute it's the corner stone of your attention and then it just fades into everything else you may think you'll love it forever or give it the same amount of attention when you made it but your not it will eventualy just fade into the backround like everything else and you finaly notice this trend and you think that you might not be able to focus on anything in your life and you give exuses to your self but in the end everything fades into the backround nothing can really be valued higher than anything else . This is why people get divorced this is why there is no world peace because shit heads can't get it through their skulls that nothing truly matters well maybe a few things for your own self that you will never lose interest in but as collective nations you can't have real interest even if they are war crimes or anything . Look at afganistan when's the last time you heard anything about afganistan ? Sure you hear the occasional blurb like "we apreciate our brave troops serving in Iraq and afganisan" and that's if they remember to mention it but everything just melts into the fog thats why we have to do all the things that we want that we love and we can't let the world governments control us we must rebel we must get our freedom from their theocratic "there is something greater" tyranies . VIA VIA VIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (don't let my exesive use of exclamation points fool you I'm very serious about this)

That creative story stuff was his too . Comment on my posts god damn it there are people reading this god damn blog I know they are I have counter so just post a comment or 8 I already have one even if it's just to whore your own blog put the link in !!! now you sons of bitches better make comments or I'll nail your genitals to a tree with a rusty rail road spike then rip off your head and d3ffic4te in j00r neck stump , oh sorry its been really hot here in T.O. and I'm not ajusting to the heat from the cold well it's taking it's toll on my brain so comment or I'll go nuts-o-futs-o- with 30 degreas centigrade under my belt .

       you may be saying to j00r s3lf that all you need to do is go to blogger help and lay a little code well its not that easy dick face for example the site that I am putting my toons on for some reason doesn't show the cartoons when I put it in . Oh well I guess I'm just going to have to go on a rampage with black market small arms and kill everyone at the blogger office because we can't upload pics . Blogger you are aware that yafro.com lets you post tons of pics but I don't use it because you can't work with html so anyone who is not that great with html and wants to get their pics and message out there then go to yafro.com NOT blogger because they are shit heads and you can only upload pics if you have external hosting I'm only 12 I don't have a god damn server!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! j00 d34d f00z aaaaaahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!

       I want to say that though the knew templates are cool ass ! I must say that because I don't know that much HTML I can't do shit with them even though they might be cool I still liked having my own personalized template but since this is a multiple user blog I needed to change it cuz the other one didn't display our names when we posted so j00 couldn't tell who it was who posted what but I think you guys have known me so j00 c4n detect eli from me but still . I think I liked to have a single person blog a bit better and even know if we go back to the good template I'll have to do everything over because it deleted when I changed the template (does that make you feel guilty enough eli?)

       Le Eli et Ici.Time for some creative writing.  True part  Alright yesterday At night I was at this party and there was a reaggae band playing there and they were really good. But I noticed something very strange theyre drummer wasnt a complete jackass! He wasnt drumming as loud as he could! He was actualy good!  False part ...why does it have to be false :(   Me and my band ( Spontaniusly Combusting Children) searched for why this was so. It was realy spooky. Me and the gang split up. We created a trap we but beer all over his drum set and farther awy in a line so hed drum slip fall and fall down the floor into a sticky web and bellow was Lava. But suddemly the other part of the gang were looking around and Drew lost his glasses. The drummer almost had him my beating the drums so lightly quickly Robert took his drum sticks and banged the drums causing Pampa the panda who was tackling the drummer to be the one who slipped. Unfortunately, it turned out that the web was not strong enough to hold a spider.So our Panda fell into lave and died. We mourned and then said " What would quentin Tarrantino do?". And we found out what to do................  TO BE CONTINUED..................oh screw it I'm finnishing it now!  Adam took his base tore off the tuner part and there was a blade. I tore the tuner part of my guitar and it was a machine gun. Then Dimitri did the same with his guitar and it just became a plastic baseball bat. We gave him another guitar and it bacame and Adrienilen Needle. We just decided for him to use the plastic baseball bat. Phillip our keyboard player played rush for a weapon. We had to have earplugs or we'd die.Then at the same time we all atacked the drummer. The rush music killed him. His head popped off like God was squeezing his stomzch as hard as he could.Bllod srited out like a firehose that couldnt stop and was out of control. Then he had a very spontiaus Combustion which was very bloody. And by Very I mean like putting 20 people in a small white room in one space then mosing them down with a Minigun. Then suddenly an Alien Spontaniusly Apperared! He said hello I am an Alien guitarist who just wanted to try the drums. We said "oh" and carried on with our lives.

       yknow I've been wondering about some questions about life like what do they do with the limb after they amputate it like I could see you studying a heart or a liver or something but an amputated leg kinda seems weird like would they close up the severed part if they were going to study it or just let the blood freeze over or what and why would you really need to study just a leg wouldn't you want the whole cadiver experience so the students could steal it dress it up in clothes and bring it to the home coming game and then you'd have to take it to a party then this really drunk girl would kiss it then maybe have sex with it and then she'd be sober and the people who stole it would tell her and then she would freak out and drop out of school and shit , you just can't do that with a severed leg though there are alot of hallowean prank possiblities

I'm sure most of you guys will like it for the most part it's exactly like this blog exept cool interesting and looks good oh ya and there aren't constant posts bitching that noone is posting comments ;) so good bye and I leave you with this peice of information if you work half assed you have a half an ass you can use for your family

       well here I am 4 in the morn with 3 cokes and 2 peices of pizza ( soon to be 3) are in me and the first stages of my caffienated paranoia is starting . It's comforting in a way I'm not sure what way but I'm sure there's some way . I hav found some new comics and will be posting linkage to them soon . I'm on the computer but also looking at the tv which is on Much Music for hope that the "hey ma'ma video will come on because it's really hot it's really the only song I like from the blackeyed peas because everything else was crap and made me want to vomit on poo poo . I think some slight carpel tunnel is starting to show it's self well thatz 4b0ut i7 so 8i b1

       yknow I was just cruising some blogs and I cam across one of a person with the same name as me and it seems odd that I took notice because another guy was named Evan but for some reason since I was ever called Evan I just feel some sort of connection to the name like it fits me perfectly and I guss whenever I see someone who is called Evan like me I kind of want to know more about them if they have some sort of connection to me in a way . It's completely stupid I mean it's just a name but it seems that when the name is chosen we have no real character and maybe the name it self forms you a bit like you see something in the name and that is what you want to live up to , the name itself will mean different things to differant people like there could be a psycho killer ted and a soup kitchen volontier ted but my name I don't know it just seems more apart of me more my identity and I want to know if it means the same to other people and if we see something together and I must say this guy was a bit like me not totaly but he had that alternitive essance , sure he was a bit of a hipster liberaltarian but still I got a vibe I'm not sure what it was but it seemed real (if you can get what I mean) .

       thanks to all of you people for getting my blog counter over the 100 mark you are a truly insparational crowd exept for those of you who thought this was a blog dedicated to pink floyd , you S.O.B.s can go fuck your selves . I have noticed latley that whenever I go nuts on a rant I sound and look a little like Lewis Black , if you don't know who he is he's the modern angry comiedian a tribute to us raving lunitics out there infact he does this thing called back in black on the daily show with John stuart and is the equivilent to watch someone yell at the t.v. while watching news . Bye Bi and y3s t3y d3$3rv3|) t0 |)13 4n|) 1 h0p3 t3y  |3|_|rn 1n h3ll !

       I just saw scarface today about 15 minutes ago actualy which is weird because I got it for my birthday and I haven't watched it until now but I loved it , in fact it's now tied with kill bill as my second favourite movie . It was really great and if you want to convice some one who is smart that anarchy works I definatly got it from that film but that might just be m3 . bi bi

       well I stayed up till 1 o'clock in the morning watching the end to fear and lothing in las vagas last night , not that I saw the beggining but I only saw the end but I must say that staying up that late on a school night is worth it for that movie . At school the rest of the school not my class because we have the play were planting stuff for our Brown goes "green" program (no pun intended i hope) and for a reward to them we had this big party at lunch but we got to come because well we're at the top of the food chain in the school so we do whatever the fuck we want ;) but anyway they had this terrible jazz band uhg you have no idea how much that sux0red , infact by the end of the lunch hour (more like 45 minutes but who cares) we were heckling them I was going to throw a button I found at them but I realized that if this is the kind of gig they are playing then I don't think they could get any lower .

       well I just created my new blog that is a watered down version of this one so I can let my parents see it if I absolutely have to and I'll use it to try new stuff that I wouldn't dare do on here for fear that I would have to reconfigure all my colours put in all my new links (which I am still doing now thanks to hurricane eli . just joking eli) and get a new counter which I hate doing for some reason .

       I'm sorry I haven't been posting for a while but I've been doing alot of stuff . Some of which is getting a full cartoon site up so I can have a web comic . I also have been paroozing the web comics to see what kind of stuff people are doing and I must say it will be some stiff competition but I hope it will work out . I'll be putting links to the new web comics tomorrow and my site whenever I finish it and I'll also be putting a free web hosting salution on here . I really hope that girl , Issabelle will put me on her links section soon .

       Well it was announced that former president Rondald Regand had died . YEAHAW . I've been so patient and finaly it was delivered to me ! I know it's mean but the dude was 93 not to mention a "conservitive". He was also the insparation (or I would imagine that he was) to Arnie or "The Governator" . Actors should stay out of pollitics and leave it to absolutly no one because no one should impose power over anyone . YAY anarchist dance time *anarchy in the uk plays*....get Emma Goldman and Lysander Spooner out on the dance floor *lookalikes of the famous anarchists come out and start dancing* *Evan holds up a sign that reads "I use the little star things too much to tell action I should just learn how to tell the actions fluently in my writing well , bye bye" then puts down sign and goes back to dance*

       Well the play is done the certan is closed and all is done . Up on that stage there were preists of a sacred art . We are the one and only cast . no person will ever do that play again . And as the dust collects on our scripts . The basis of our affection and love that we formed to on another through this play . That peice of art that fuled the wrap party . That everybody wraped their scheduels around and later wraped their minds around . The only scrips . Full scripts will belong to us . Though this play was made up of many different parts . We have the full collection of scenes . The re-writen and re-writen scenes . Some so re-done that is was impossible to desipher them from the original . I don't think I'll ever feel closer to any other people that much again . Though we may say some are self obsorbed or weird or gay . We all became freinds tonight . We all knew we were part of something bigger . We let everything go just for that one second where we knew what the other was thinking . Though we might have been divided in the past now we were all together as one . Now is when the freindships are formed when we creap out of our little "clicks" and "Posseys" and when we finaly are truely together not only as freinds . Or even lovers . Just people . A true bonding of humanity . The only real time where I felt I was apart of something great . Good bye and as the certan closes remember me for what I did . for how I made you laugh cry and shudder . for how I made you question everything you knew . How I learned and loved and wished and dreamed . Let no man know what I knew for it is for me alone and the others too .

       I think I might just get into web design . It seems pretty because you get to see the source of it all and it's completely amazing  . just to see a page that you have designed out of the bits of code is awsome . Now I'm on isi's blog . I hope alot more people will go to my blog because of it . If not then it still doesn't really matter because I'm apart of a blogging community . Even though I was before this a sort of a fluke and is a spontanious link of 2 sites and even if I don't gain anything from it it's still merging together for a common goal of just keeping your self known . to leave a legacy to humanity even if it's "the arrival of the mini-skirt" . thats a line from the play my class is doing . Well sorta it's a version of the line . On the subject of the play . We did our second preformace today and it's so funny how after the first scene all the nervesness just drops away from you . buh bye bitches

       well I haven't posted in while but this time I really don't care what you think I'm not going to appologize for not doing something that I don't have to do anyway . Well we did our first preformance of the play today . it was really fun . There were all these little kids like grade 1 and 2 and after when I was leaving the school . I saw all these little kids pointing at me and saying "oh cool thats the guy from the play" . I guess I gave a note worthy preformance .

       Hello everybody out there in blogland . As you know I am a bit of a music critic and while my colleague Eli (pimppanda) tends to focus on the greatness of the greats (Neil Young , Alice Cooper , The Beatles ect.) . I am a much much more petty man . I like to focus on the utter unlistenablility of modern popular music . Yes there are a few that are very good like Billy talent but there are also a rather disturbing amount of untalented manufactured so called "artists" . So that's why I did this post because I was watching Much Music at 4 in the morning and I need to rant about all the shit that I saw floating around . First lets start with the guys . My nemesis and yours good charlotte : see disguised boy bands .......oh god this is just too easy . Actualy I'll explain for those who haven't been reading my blog since forever . good charlotte or as I like to refer to them the unholy bringers of the end of existence . These people's sole purpos for existing is to drive me to the brink of insanity or suicide . Every time I hear on of their songs I block my ears and twitch and rock back and forth in the featle position . This band even sounds like the backstreet boys it's just instead of a synthisyser in the backround there's guitars , basses and drums  (which they don't play) . Ever wonder why they have a huge female following ? Ever wonder why the backstreet boys or n'sync has a huge female following ? Well since I'd probably spend the whole time yelling about how they suck lets move on shall we . Hubastank : (not sure if I spelt it correctly) They are just like G.C. but there style is  slightly  more punk because they don't over punk it . Yknow once you start refering to your clothes as a costume then it's not really style is it ? I feel basicly the same way to them as goodcharlotte but I think they kinda mean well . Either that or they are actualy more evil and plan on taking the minds of the world . All I have to say is  Rush is to Eli as Goodcharlotte and hubastank are to Evan . Now thets get to the chix0rz . First and Worst Hillary Duff : She seems to be a paradox in some ways . she's trying so hard to grow up and yet her fan base consists of 8 year old girls who look up to her . Hillary Duff , floresant lights and cow hormones . You figure the last scentence out for your self . Of course growing up fast is good it forces kids to be more expeirienced and more educated which for some reason other people don't like that . "Ignorace is strength" . You didn't here me say anything . Well atleast ol'Hillary is whoring it up . In her videos she's either parading around in a white blouse in the rain , having sex with the microphone because in each scene she looks like she's at the moment of climax  or even doing ultrasoftcore lesbian porn with her sister who looks like Uma Thurman........well if ever wanted to see Uma (basicly) feeling Hillary Duff up then your in luck . In an interview she said she never rebelled as a teen . Daddy's little goodthinker . Her not rebelling I'm kind of thankful for because if she rebelled she would be like Christina Agulara now and I think I would stop going to school just to watch those videos . And if she rebelled then she probablly would make good music I would have one less thing to rant about here on the blog . Now lets get to Avril Lavein : I want to say I hate her for being a poser bitch and she's anti-drugs . I also feel for her I think she actualy wanted to make good music but she is just a small town girl from canada and she got really exited about all the cash . warning : capitalisim may  cause disturbing after affects use with caution and if possible with a Liberatarian government  . Now the Scary think is that the closest thing we have to a popular rocker chick is Fefe Dobsone and you have no idea how much that scares me . Well atleast she writes songs about hating people and yells and looks like a coke head after a prefromance . Remember though Jesus died for your sins but I watched crappy music videos and interveiws for the simple fact to know who to hate and why so you don't have to and thats close enought to be a messia , right  :)

       I was watching a tv show at 7:00 last night and there was a news bulliten that said and I quote : "Ray Charelles dies tonight at 11" and I'm thinking damn thats acurate . Just think about him watching that he'd be like : "fuck! ok well might as well make it creative ,hunny get the vibrator and a rope o'll charllie's going out in style" ok I'm pretty sure he didn't die haning from a rafter with a vibrator up his ass but still .

       Don't worry this isn't the final draft of the template . I wanted to get the feel for the "tic-tac" and I didn't want it to be all normal so I figured I'd put up my andy worhol skull pic for now . It should be completely changed by next friday .

       Okay for the next while I'll be talking about the most asanine things . This is because I'm going to montreal next week and I want to pack as much content on my blog as humanly possible with (what seems to be) carpel tunnel syndrome . I haven't had it proven by a doctor but I know it's some computer related muscle strain injury . It actualy happend while I was playing space invaders . Yes I'm a sucker for the old video games . Anyway I was pownding on fire as hard as I could to blast those little freak alien bastards into oblivion and then I was killed . So I let off of the keyboard and as soon as I moved my arm it felt like I was pelted with very large rocks . Long story short I'm probably going to lay off the site and the new template for a bit until this arm heals . Upside : I won't have to do as much work at school because it's on my right hand . For those of you who are gathering their  sick  opinions of how I got my bout of ( I don't want to say cts because I just realized that you can't get that in your uper arm) computer injury . That think that my injury was because of a certain type of site on computers you can just go to hell . Now back to Montreal . Since I Won't be posting all week next week I'll give you a bonus . I'll take all my daily accounts down and then put them up here so you can see everything you need to know that I knew then . Second I will also give you (almost) all the pictures that a take while on the trip so you can see what we all look like  . We may look frightening at first but you will learn to love us......just like monkeys! :)

       Okay in my design for the "new" blog template I will incorperate sketches of mine . This will be feasible I'm sure but possibly dificult because of how I plan to do so . You see what I want to do is take an existing template (most likely Tic-Tac) and take the original image out and replace it wil a collection of my sketches . Unfortunately these sketches will probably have nothing to do with the blog (little Japanse girls in school uniforms , crazy people , fan art that I made ect.) so bare with me if you don't like the sketches . Actualy don't bare with me if you don't like the sketches you can fuck off . Just joking . Well I better go I was playing a big ass game of space invaders while writing this and my hand is numb .

       For some reason everyone I know with a blog and a counter has very close amounts of hits as mine and alot of them have gotten their counters after me . So you can see my perdiciment my blog sucks and no one is coming . Thats why I'm going to try another renovation over the next week or so . I'll either find that my template is fine or you'll have a whole new blog on your hands . Though it will be the same blog it will look different .

       Now we're near to Ottawa where we'll be stoping for lunch and stuff . I've basicly used up all my film on flash wars . What is flash wars you ask? it's when you take a surprise picture of a person with the flash on and scare them it also makes on hell of a funny picture :) I also tried to get some nice landscape shots for you guys . though a good amount of them will still be of surprised class mates  and irrecognisable blurs . Hopefully I'll atleast be able to show you the landmarks I will visit .   June 16 2004  Okay so I've went through 2 disposable cameras but one was the one I won in a scavenger hunt to find out facts about Montreal . My group was surprisingly good . It was me , Eli , Alison , Stefani , Essery and Tasha . That just proves that intergration of sexes provokes the best in people.....well sometimes . We went to a big church on top of the hill here (TOUR GUIDE : It's not a hill it's a mountain!!!!!). Our Tour guide is obsessed with deffending "Mount Royal" as a mountain  NOT  a hill . Of course she's also obsessed with flirting with the Male teachers . It's funny (and a little disturbing) to watch adults (especialy teachers) flirt . The funny thing is that the all the male teachers are married . Looks like we have what the french call a pute ( think I might have spelt it wrong I think there might be an s in there ) .

       you know what I just love ? Spam e-mails about how god damn big my cock could be . Do you have any fucking idea how much shit I get in my inbox about enlarging my prick ! It just makes me want to drive over to their flat and bash their heads in with a spanner . Those wankers should be shot and heaved into a burning heap of rubbish . Then put in a lock-up full of randy inmates that will shag them in their eye holes . Do you like my use of British slang ? If there are any mistakes then post on the shout box or on the comments . Oh ya if the shout box backround is black and the text is black then just refresh the shout box and if it's still giving you problems just post on the comments about it :)

       I should be putting this post to good use and putting in the notes that I made while in montreal but I wanted to talk about michael moore . I didn't see bowling for columbine but I always dismissed it as one of those exposeyes about how guns are bad and it was just a message to be trendy . Though now that I saw the trailor for Fahrenheit 9/11 I think that he's not sutch a whiney little bitch and that he actualy meant bowling for columbine . You see what I had against a movie about crappy gun control is that they would just be bitching about the second amendment for the whole time . The thing the U.S. won't tell you is the second amendment isn't EVEN ABOUT FUCKING GUNS GOD DAMN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it's about the right for a people's army to over through an opressive force in the government . So if the government sais every one can have a gun to shoot squirells they don't have to deal with an uprising . Most liberals don't understand that and say get rid of the second amendment but in reallity the U.S. should educate the people on it's true meaning . Of course what government would sacrefice their own comfort for the well being of the pubilic ? But the great thing about  F9/11  is that it basicly conferms all of my opinions towards the U.S. government . So if this trend of me being right continues then watch out for Bill Gates to enslave man kind then rape goats and eat babies .

       Alright I'm on the bus . I thought is would suck more than it does . Eli is beside me and is yelling to people . Stefani is showing me her plush duck that she brought for the trip . I'm not sure why . I think is supposed to be a funny little quark but it's just fucked up and annoying .                Now we've made out first stop (at tim hortons) . Because our teacher (Mr.Fraser) won't let us have coffee I had to get a coke and a double chocolate doughnut for the caffien . Keep in mind it's about 9 in the morning .

I won't have access to internet but hopefully the thought that I'll be coming back with a post full of little notes I made while there and pictures !! yep pictures ! you get to see everyone in my class . Unfortunately for there protection I won't tell you who everybody is in the pics but it's still good . well I hope my crazy assness will inspire and illuminate while I'm gone because it sure as hell didn't happen while I was here .

       well I found out that I won't be leaving until tomorrow because of an air traffic controler strike in Costa Rica . You can figure out how that fits in with me staying at my grandma's on your own . But I did get the pics from montreal for you guys here they are .  this one was the first I took I think Eli was a little surprised to get a picture taken of him at 6 in the morning . It was taken just before we left Toronto .   this one was the first shot fired in the flash wars but I put it here because I wanted to show how crazy stef is .   now lets jump to our first night in Montreal . This was taken at the IMAX theater we went to . Well atleast I think it was . I can't think of any other place that looks like that .   there's eman or Emmanuel if you want to call him that . He looks like he's being confused by some thing maybe he was thinking about anything in the universe . I'm just joking around . It's so fun to make fun of Emmanuel for being dumb and it's so very easy . Now here's one of me   I'm not really sure what I was doing when that was taken . I don't know who it was that took it either .   doesn't this remind you of some crazy movie like Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas™ or some thing like that (I'm sorry about the trade mark thing I just always wanted to do that) . well thats all the pictures I'll put in because it's going to be hell to publish this bitch .

       well I just found out that I'll be going to my grandma's house for about 5 days . I won't be able to blog because my granny aint got a computer . She's one of those technophobes . I ask her "why don't you get a computer it would make alot of stuff easy for you ?" and she sais "I'm to old to learn anything new...and plus I always have my type writer" . I kinda feel bad for her because her type writer only has dial-up . Anyway since I won't be able to blog or go on MSN or keep up on web comics I'll hang myself with my pants . Just joking don't worry this will give me a sort of break I've been needing . I'll be doing comics and and little graphics for my new site and this one . I just won't be doing any html or importing images or touching up stuff on photoshop  (oh ya I'll be geting adobe illustrator soon too) . I won't keep a journal of staying at my grandma's house mostly because it will probablyl just be me watching tv and drawing all day so it doesn't matter . I've been geting into showcase it's a movie channel here in canada (pretty much the only one on basic cable ) . It has alot of cool shows and movies . a couple nights ago I found this great movie on it about german lesbians . It was a really good film . They also have a great show that you probably never heard of called made in Canada . It's about a tv production company...long story short it's funny if you ever have the chance to watch it then do so or else you will be tormented with the regret of what would have been and it will tear you up inside until your last breath never forgeting you missed the chance to watch made in Canada :) I'll soon be putting all the stops out to promote my new template and my blog in general so put the word out NOW!!!! tell your freinds , family , enemies , teachers , camp counselers , people you just met like 5 minutes ago but find compelled to have a meaningful freindship with , pets or anyone else you can think of . Link me to your blog or your site . Better yet tell people about me on your sites and blogs . take out ads in your local news paper to tell people about me . I don't care just tell people . If your a kid who's going to camp tell your fellow campers , counselers or who ever . If you're an adult and you're going to work tell your fellow workers , employers or employees . NOW!!!! Run go tell them NOW!!!!! there's not a minute to spare . I don't care even if you think my blog is good  JUST DO IT!!!!!!

       well since it's summer holiday I was watching the connan O'brian show last night and I saw the U.S. air guitar champion . It was funny when she preformed because she put so much heart in it . She even did the pedals and at the end she lifted up her skirt so you could see her panties . That was the funniest part . Well I found a good free web hosting option . Well maybe not good but half decent . So the comic site should be up by the end of the summer .

       well today was our last day at brown public school . Of course in about an hour it will be yesterday was our las day at Brown . I'm glad that I'm going to be going to Deer Park because "Brown" is the lamest name for a school . Today was just overall fucked up . I can't explain it any other way than totaly fucked up . I would go into the specifics but I have sworn to secrecy.....oh fuck it . First our last party was lame as hell thats why I ran through the school in only my underwear . Yerp I streaked (well I had my boxers on) through the school...ok fine it was only on the third floor but some people saw me . Mostly because I was yelling "it's streaking time!!!" . I didn't get in much trouble with the Fraseman . Infact he said he wouldn't tell the office but if one of the other teachers saw and reported me he wouldn't protect me . Fortunately I got off scott free (I'm as amazed as you are) . So then (this actualy happend before I streaked but I wanted to mention that first because it's just cool ) Alison kisses Eli . Okay for those of you not in my class this is like the most fucked up thing that could ever happen...well not really but just damn unlikely . It was funny that he told me not to tell anyone and yet I'm spreading it over the web . Actualy he told everybody during the day so I just suppose that it's okay to publish his personal affairs on the internet with no consent from him :) please don't sue . And then Alison anoucess that she likes Emmanuel . (sorry for being a gosip whore but I gotta put something on here with some action) The funny thing is that she already kissed him at a party like a week ago . Well actualy he kissed her but same damn thing . But you see Eli really likes Alison so when he heard they kissed at the party he was pissed . And later in a convo on msn Eman mentioned to Alison (I know because I was there) what Eli said about him kissing her that he wanted to be the first to kiss her . So one wonders was that kiss that she gave him but a simpathy kiss . Still though Eli got a little action from the hottest girl in the class so does it really matter ? This whole thing has made Eli a little paranoid . Not oddly that it was a sympathy kiss but because after school when Alison reveiled her love for Eman he was confused to if he could return the love . So in deciding not to have a relationship her because of his confusion and the fact that Eli started crying because he wanted Alison all for himself (or so it seems) . So because Eli assumes that Eman is so ruthless he is ploting some sort of evil plot conspiring against Eli to knock him out of the picture . This of course I fathom is just Eli being totaly insane and utterly and imencely paranoid . Mostly not because this is totaly self indulgent on Eli's part but because Eman isn't smart enough to do that trust me . He's as sharp as an egg in other words . Eli also claims that all of that crying and whyning wasn't because he wanted Alison all for himself but because he wanted to protect her from herself . Which I don't beleive for a god damn second but it's true in the past he was very selfless towards her (geting her dates with people she liked even though he liked her at that time ) . Despite all this evidence I feel in my gut it's a complete load of bull shit but whatever . So lets recap . I run half nekkid in my school , Eli gets a little action from Alison , Alison sais she likes Eman , Eli becomes more like me in being paranoid and then starting his own religon (it's a really cool religon I'll post a manifesto  of it when Eli works all the kinks out of it) . So remember kids Big Brother is watching so make sure to have alot of fun in the shower ;)

       I changed the template (once again) . I think this one works alot better but 'll probably think something else will in a week . Of course in a week I will be sitting free from the torments of school . Yep it's summer holidays in exactly 2 days . Infact we had our graduation today . It was really fun because we had like a rave (well sorta) party after . Pema and I raided the supplies and got meter long pixie stix . Pema then went insane from over caffeination and lots of sugar . We haven't found him yet but I'm assuming he'll be in his underwear passed out on the side of a highway . Thats my prediction anyway . That last day of school party will be one bitch . We went insane when it was just a little afterparty this is our last party at brown . Were going to blow the roof off that motherfucking school . Either that or it's going to be the worst party ever . I wonder if the Frenchies will french it up at the party ;-) (inside joke)  So in concusion I'll be here for the next while so I'll be posting almost daily making the template as beautiful as possible and......uh......ya .

       I'm not sure if I like the new template I made . Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of my favourite movies but something just doesn't seem right . Comment and tell me what you like or hate about it . I think it might just be having tic-tac as my base template . just comment or post on the shout box . If you don't comment or post I'll bitch and moan until you do . And no one want's that do they ? because I haven't even ventured to bitching and moaning factor 5 on here yet . You people have not yet even seen the extent of my whining!!!!!!! INFIDELS!!!! YOU SHALL FIND MY REVENGE SWIFT AT THE HAND OF ME BITCHING ABOUT YOU NOT COMMENTING!!!!!!!! I shall smite all who do not post or comment . Your deaths will be swift and painful !  or yknow whatever......

       well I would like to retract my list that I made yesterday because  I have been making numerous discoveries in the field of suckage . I would also like to retract it on the contition that there are alot of bands in the world and I couldn't possibly form an opinion on all of them or even most of them , hell I probably couldn't make an opinion on fraction of them . Now I would like to anounnce before you hear it from any one else I have that dee-lite song "groove is in the heart" stuck in my head and the only way I can get it out is to play it until I am completely averted to it . Now I would like to put new TV shows that have come to my attention watching canadian cable during the late morning and late night . The Chris Isaak show originaly aired on the U.S. channel showtime is now on Much More Music (the canadian VH1) . This show not only has funny situations consisting of orgies and public sex but also has Chris Isaak's music and his brand of bluesy rock is enough reason to watch . This hour has 22 minutes originaly aired on the CBC it is now on showcase . Though I started watching this show a long time ago I stoped for an even longer time and now with the new cast I would say that it's quite good especialy now that Gavin Croford is on it . Made in canada originaly aired on the CBC now on showcase . This show like this hour has 22 minutes started on the CBC but isn't like This hour has 22 minutes in any other way . It's witty and smart . Infact if it was a woman I would marry it then divorce it because marrage is man made prison that can only lead to unhappyness and regret :) The show makes an exelent point of what goes into making shows in a Dilbert™ (I love that little trademart thing) like environment .

       Okay to recap over the week . I was gone to my grandma's and she doesn't have a computer so here's all the news that you didn't know because you were to busy pleasuring your self to naked pictures of loretta swit . Canada had an election the liberals won......fuck the liberals won . alright this isn't really to bad I mean we could have had steven Harper of the conservitives who wanted to criminalize gay marrage and he wanted to ban abortions too . I would have much rather had Jack Layton of the NDP (new democratic party) or that guy from the green party . I'll explain what kind of elections happen in canada for you southern fried chickens . each part of a city or town has a representitive or an MP (member of parlement) these MPs are elected from the people in that area . The party with the most seats in the house of commons is the leader of the country and the leader of the party is the prime minister . So we can hold an election to elect a prime minister but this also gives other parties more power by how many seats they get so we can have more diverse government . Though only one party is ruling some other veiws can have more say in the governing without it being the ruling party . I'll also tell you about a minority government and a majority government . A minority government is when a party gets more seats than all the other parties but not more than half of the seats . So this means that all the parties have to work closer together and Rick Mercer said it best : "These men hate each other it's not an act and a minority government would just bug the hell out of them and thats why I'm in favour of it . Infact they should just divy up 24 susux drive and put in some bunk beds . That way Paul Martin , Steven Harper , Jack Layton and Gilles Ducceppe can stay up all night gigling and planing the fate of the world ." Okay now more important things . The U.S. is issuing a Draft . Okay not exactly a Draft . They are taking people who were in the military and were discharged then puting them against their will into the army again . Kinda like a draft but they don't have to train them so they can get killed quicker . ATTENTION ALL HIPPIES WITH PREVIOUS MILITARY EXPERIENCE FLEE THE COUNTRY NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well thats all for world news on the EBS (Evan Blogcasting System )

I just drove across the island and back all the way listening to the BBC world service I guess the soothing british voices affected me .I arrived in Jamaica no problems flying alone exept for the fact that as soon as I come to this damn country (every fucking time) it turns from nice and sunny to torrential down pour . Though now it's nice exept that I feel like I just to a bath in bacon fat . See ya whenever bye for now Evan signing off .

       I downloaded that blues brother's song soul man and I when it downloaded I played it at the highest volume my speakers could go and I did the dan achroid dance . Y'know the one where he's jumping around and kinda looks like he's playing hop-scotch . They actualy did some good songs . I guess some good came of watching that SNL music special . Did you know that once chevy chase had internal bleeding because of when he did his falls . I would like to finish with a salute to Dan Achroid : Jane you ignorant slut .

       I would like to thank all the people who come to my site for helping me get 410 hits . I know that 400 would have probably been more traditional but by the time I checked the counter it was 409 so I thought I would make 410 because even though at the moment I'm writing this it's 409 hits  who ever see's this post means that they went to my blog which would mean that they would push it to 410 . So......HAPPY 410 HITS EVERYBODY . This whole summer vacation thing is screwing me up . I'm going to bed at 4:00 in the morning . Not getting alot of work done . It's just totaly fucking me up . I thought I would have the comic site done by the end of my first month of summer vacation . It's ended and I haven't even got my home page done yet . Oh fuck it I'm just going to have a shower and try not to think about my wasted time .

Dodge ball : story line : 7.5 / 11 humor : 10.5 / 11 Use of pirates : 11/11 over all : 9/11 . The weird thing is that I'm going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 soon . There are numerous unexplained phenomina on THE DARKER SIDE OF THE MOON !

       I just started working with photoshop really hard and I must say I like it . I got a tutorial for it and now ihavefun (it's an inside joke) . I always thought that the catch to my layout would be that all my graphics are totaly hand drawn but now I'm starting to have second thoughts . In my new layout for my cartoon site I think I might just use photoshop graphics but I can't help but feeling that I'm giving in . well all I have to really do is just get good enough with photoshop that I can have exactly what I want I guess .

       I was without internet for the past 5 days and at this moment I feel asthough I'm having an Orwellian nightmare . You see because I wanted this to be a blog that my parents didn't know about (see what to do when your mom finds out about your blog) it's hard for me to write because my father is choping onions not 2 meters away from this little laptop and with the terrible little mouse on it and the wonky s key doesn't make it any easier . Though this little ibook . Through out the week it has provided me with the gift of DVD . I saw ghost world , El Meriachi , Resivoir Dogs , Wasabi , cold mountain and along came polly . I got a few souveniers for my freinds . I won't say what they are because I know they read this . I'll give you more details about the fact that a part of jamaica is going through a revolution . There are riots assasinations all typical revolution typed stuff . exept they are all just in one city . ofcourse it is the capital but whatever . I just glad I'm in another part of the island . You won't hear any of this stuff on the BBC world service .

       Today I played some tennis and ping pong then went for a swim . I hate this ibook I'm blogging with . The keyboard is just generaly messed up and around the keyboard gets really hot . I saw Euro-trip and Big fish Both not to bad . No matter what anybody sais about the sort of animal house humour in Euro-trip it's really funny . Espescialy the Dildo thingy . Well see ya again real soon and remember I'm funky Tut and I hope I'm your favourite honkey .

       I just decided to say fuck it to the new template . I'm not going to not do it I'm just going to change the orininal theme and the fact that I'm not going to tell anyone . I started thinking gothy sorta black and white comic thing but now I'm thinking andy warhol technicolor LSD trip thing . basicly the exact oposite but it will be easier . I figure it would be a bit more fun . So now you will see step by step what happends to my blog . I also have to say that any graphics that have been aproved for the links will be gone . I'll replace them with andy warhol or and tie-dye themed stuff . Oh ya here in Jamaica there's a religeon called rasta where you can't cut your hair and smoke alot of weed . I think just might not be an athiest any more . Well I'm not a 100% on everything in rasta . I think that it's a branch of a christianity sorta . It's in the Jew-christian kind of belief system exept they warship another person like jesus but I'm not sure why . It might be because the beleive he's the massia or maybe because he has a Buddah thing going down . Oh ya and since I'm down here I might get a new cell phone because they have the weirdest ones down here . I saw one with a round screen , another that was as narrow as a pack of gum then some had these fake diamonds along the sides and when the phone rings the diamonds light up . They are all the absolute coolest . see ya EBS signing off .

       Well I was without internet ever since I got back from Jamaica  so I couldn't post . A real Bitch aint it I go to Jamiaca where there isn't that great internet service and I look forward to coming back to a steady connection but it isn't here , Satan why do you mock me with a tangled web of irony ! Well anyway when I was on the plane here I met an amazingly hot girl but alas she was older than me so it wouldn't work ( girls don't like younger guys until they're atleast 30 ) but anyway I did get to meet her and bask in her babe-o-liciousness for a while . Ofcourse there was an even hotter girl that was on the shuttle bus . I didn't meet her but she was very hot and I think would have been more my type (by her look anyway) . Well anyway Bell sympatico internet sucks like a date rape victim . I hope you have a pleasant today and an overly complicated tomorrow .

       My stupid ass mind has just desided to change preferences once again so now I don't like the idea of a psychadelic template . I should just get a lobeotemy so I won't have any other creative preferance other than grey . I guess over the years all my preferences will change and my blog will have massive face lifts . I think what I could do is make lots of templates for me and other people and then I can just click to what I want that day or week or month . From now on I am going to try and keep dedicated to the writing  not  just the template . I have lost tons of sleep and time over templates but damn near nothing to my blog it self . It was obvious all along why people weren't reading my blog . I am destined though to make sure I have a following on this blog . Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but one day I will be on the Blogger's recomended list or something like that .Right now I just need a fucking vacation , Oh ya and by the way I might as well finish off what I said I was going to tell you about the assasinations and stuff . The government here has be showed to be tied with the organised crime in the ghetos . What the government did was supply these people with gun and money and they policed the gehtos for them so the police didn't have to go . the gangs the gangs would also make sure that all the people in that reagon would vote for a MP that gave the gang the supplies . A wonderful little system they have down here ain't it . I actualy do like Jamaica it's a place where all my whack job theories come true .

       well I haven't posted in a while because of my film course . It really eats up the time . If I'm not in it from 9 - 4 I'm at Eli's discussing the day and when I'm at home I'm thinking of ideas for films . well today though I basicly got told by my teacher that the movie I made could never get into a festival which I was wicked pleased about because I always wanted to be the renigade director/writer that over does everything . The class seemed to really like it though even the one sort of überserious girl that I almost never see laugh laughed and she's the most serious Director / Writer that is in the class .  I'm really looking forward to doom 3 but I'll have to soop my little bitch ass computer up for it . If I get my movie idea voted on to be one of the 4 movies that we make next week I'm going to try and incorperate a dancing backwards talking midget like on twin peaks . see ya
