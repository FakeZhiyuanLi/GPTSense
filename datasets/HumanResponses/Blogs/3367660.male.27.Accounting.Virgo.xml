      The Associated Press Updated: 4:58 p.m. ET May 21, 2004BOSTON - Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry is considering delaying accepting his party’s nomination to gain time to raise and spend private contributions and lessen President Bush’s multimillion-dollar financial advantage, campaign officials said Friday.  advertisement   The Democratic Party would still hold its national convention in Boston at the end of July. If Kerry were to delay acceptance of the nomination for a month, it would help even the financial playing field with Bush, who will be nominated at the Republican National Convention in New York five weeks later.

      In some ways it was a typical breakfast meeting. The waitress was pleasant, the eggs were average, and the restaurant was full of busy people. We shared a cup of black, coffee-like substance, and the first few times my client took a sip he managed to spill quite a bit of it. His trembling hand was just one of the symptoms of his burnout. That’s why we were meeting. He wanted to know if I could help him.  I picked up a fork and explained that as long as I used it for eating, the fork would last indefinitely. However, if I began to use it to drive nails or dig trenches, it would soon break. The key was to use it for what it was designed to do.

      Musical tastes: Famous songs about food By Ian Hodder Special to MSN  If a DJ ranked pop culture's favorite song subjects, love would top the chart. But one notch down on the countdown, with a catalog of hits that spans all genres, the topic of food would score a strong second. Folks have been getting down to food songs since ancient civilizations described pit-roasted meat in verse — way before your iPod blasted Kelis' ubiquitous "Milkshake."   The food-song cornucopia runneth over with tunes from almost every major pop musician. The Beatles played "Strawberry Fields Forever" and the lesser-known, more-culinary "Savoy Truffle." Billy Joel reminisced about "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant," as Blondie opted to "Eat to the Beat." ZZ Top enjoyed "TV Dinners." Smashing Pumpkins made "Mayonaise." Kelsey Grammer capped each episode of "Frasier" with a serving of "Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs," while Weird Al Yankovic cooked up "Eat It," "I Love Rocky Road," and "Girls Just Want to Have Lunch."

      Flowers? Chocolates? Brunch? Those are all acceptable ways of honoring mom but we thought we'd do something different. An all-new release of Blogger on Mother's day. It's not a traditional gift, but we made it ourselves so we thought that might count for something. Please bear with us this Sunday at 3PM PST for a couple hours of scheduled downtime while we work on launching all the additional features and a whole new look for Blogger.
