      what a fantastic week.  i have no idea where all the time has gone.  wait, yes i do. it's been in living in the moments.  seeing the loved ones (family and friends) talking (talk talk talk) and just, breathing, re-living, releaving (sp?)... so, one of my girlfriends has left austin, i'm leaving this week for colorado (about a month there) maybe a week in wyoming, and then after that montana... have this feeling that i will stay there, maybe... have been thinking of portland, oregon; somewhere in CO or NM or AZ or UT as well, and then, after a conversation with friends the other night re-remembered that i really wanted to go to missoula a couple years ago, wanted to work there two summers ago (worked in estes park instead) and... well shit, why not?  according to my sources, it's a place that i'll probably like a lot, and if not forever, why not at least for a year?  of course of course, i'll be checking it all out first, that's the whole point of my trip anyway, to scope out the territory and find someplace that i want to be for awhile.  get my stuff straight, and kind of keep living how i've been living these past few weeks... (granted, i will have to get a job soon...)  but yea, things have just been absolutely wonderful (i hate saying that, i feel like i'll jinx myself) but why not share it, things are just fantastic, free, and the road is open. yes my friend, open.

      i ordered a lot of books last week, my brother got me a gift certificate to Amazon.com for my birthday. books really are the greatest gift, there are so many to read... anyway, i ordered 6 (some i've wanted specifically, others are author's i've wanted know more). i started the Secret Knowledge of Water (by Craig Childs) this morning. God, I'm being ripped back to the desert and i'm dreaming ahead of the life i'm living and the life i'm choosing for myself. so glad to have said no to living here for another 5 months (not that here isn't a wonderful place) and to put myself out there once again, into the risk and wonder of taking chances. of living the ideas and dreams that i have.    because i feel like it's been a year and a half since i've seen this girl who goes out, takes risks, fears nothing and soars with the freedom of clear horizons. i feel as though i've ghosted myself, but i realize had i not done this at least once, i would never know the repulsion my soul and mind has been put through. i would not have these experiences to draw from. it is in answers that i have always known that now i  feel  to a greater extenct the necessity of following your dreams and living for your happiness.      on the bus out of Rio de Janeiro (Heeo de Ja-nay-roo) at the beginning of june this year i saw this phrase spray-painted on a building as we whisked by on the highway: "Se voce nao tivesse medo, o que voce faria?" Translated it says: "If you didn't have fear, what would you be?"      Se eu nao tivesse medo, eu iria voar.... If I didn't have fear, I would fly. I've learned to fly many times, walking in mountain meadows, scaling high peaks, falling in love amongst alpine wildflowers (with both the wild flowers and the boy) and drying out in the depths of canyons. this time, it is the fear that is drying up and i again prepare myself to soar.     i know not yet where specifically i will go. colorado is my birthplace (two times) but also too touristy, jaded, and full of hardcore ego-maniacs... (myself included at times?) but i still love it's lands, and inevitably, the wonderful wonderful people i always meet who also love the land. yet i also want to continue the wonderful romance i started with the desert. redrock canyons, colorado plateau, pinyon pine and juniper, robust rainstorms on clear fall days, and the pinpricks of cold night air, sitting in the basins rimmed by the ranges.    a good friend of mine once said, the desert sucks you dry.  it's a place for escape but no where to live.      but isn't it though? today i think to myself that it is a place to re-find yourself (after being ghosted for a year, after working for a year on things that others thought were best for you but you hated) to scrape the guts of your soul along that redrock rimrock and collapse beneath the pinyon pine on a mesa, dark clouds gathering above, giving, just enough, to let you taste moisture in the air, to pattern droplets in the dust on the hood of your car.   the desert will wear out the anxieties of disturbed energies in the over-crowded places, and help you find other things to love again if you can't love your fellow man; let it be the scarcity of the desert that puts into perspective the abundance of our lives.    and let it be the desert and dreams of arid air that propel me to lose my fear, porque se eu nao tivesse medo, eu iria escrever...

      well alrighty then, totally inspired by the blogged writings of a dear friend of mine I have decided to create this lovely lovely blog.  perhaps this would have been a good idea while i was in brazil.  internet cafe's and long mass e-mails could have been a more pleasant experience.  i write here and here only; you look only if you want to, not because i have bombarded your limited-space e-mail inbox.    so a quick explanation i guess, for the title of this blog.  i sat here only shortly ago debating for too long deciding what to call this thing.  i went for 'green tea' since i drink a fair amount of it, but alas (drat!) it was taken.  along with two or three others (already forgotten) that i tried.  so now we have this, 'hot chai de los abajos'.  and what does it mean?  hmm... well, it's actually the name of my vehicle, inspired by a camping trip in the upper reaches of the abajo mountains (ha ha) in southeastern utah a couple years ago.  obviously, our drink of choice on this trip was the chai tea.

      being hard on oneself. not accepting oneself. where did this come from and why are you allowing yourself to have no fun? why do you think that you are bothering people? why do you think that you have no skills? everyone is allowed to learn, to make mistakes, and to improve upon behavior that is not perfect. everyone is allowed to grow and other people are happy if you grow and improve. people don't want you to recluse yourself. people want for you to be a good, strong, confident person. you like to lead, but good leaders also listen. you like to be in charge, but that is a dictator, you need to allow situations to unfold as they do. different groups have different dynamics and the best that you can do is fill the niche that you create for yourself to make the group the happiest that it can, to be a contributor, not a controller. you have been trying to control, time to contribute. smile, be happy, enjoy what life has to offer you, take advantage of the situation and appreciate the amazing people that you are meeting. this is not a competition. we are all here to learn and to help save lives. that is the mind set that you should and need to be in. do not beat yourself up, be confident and proud, contribute and think clearly. the big picture sets in, did you breathe, ask questions, make eye contact, establish trust? these are what you need to work on, not what other people think about you...
