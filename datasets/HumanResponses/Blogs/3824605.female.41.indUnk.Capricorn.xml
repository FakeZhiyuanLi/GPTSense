      What should you do when the baby is sleeping?  Finish the laundry or start a blog?  I guess you've figured out which way I went.  For those who don't know me I'm the mom of six kids age 8 months up to 12 years.  There are three girls and three boys but so far no sign of Alice the maid or any other maid for that matter.  This weekend is the festival in our small town so I need to get cakes baked for a cake walk, wash ball shirts for those in the parade, find change for the kiddie carnival tomorrow and find mosquito spray since the oldest three kids will want to hang around downtown afater the parade tonight. Stay tuned, tomorrow may be more interesting!

      Only I could manage to get a bee sting on my thigh.  I was picking up pool toys outside this afternoon.  It looked like it was going to rain and I didn't want them to blow away.  I picked up the beach ball and somehow managed to mash a bee or wasp on my thigh.  Ouch!!  It still hurts.  It was a pretty stinky day all around.  The morning was consumed with errands.  Pick up materials for 4-H projects, return a swimsuit I was sure would fit dd but didn't, get some groceries and drop off some important papers.  I had my six and the girl I babysit for.  They were picking at each other the whole time.  That is not a big deal but it does get on your nerves.  This afternoon dd worked on 4-H projects.  She did make progress but oh the whining and complaining getting there.  I wanted to go to the drive in tonight but it looks like the weather is not on my side.  Maybe tomorrow?!

      Well, my baby has reached the "I can put stuff in the vcr" stage  She was very industriously trying to put her block in it this morning.  I'll have to hunt up those baby gates.  I'm afraid she's going to be an early walker.  She is 8 months and cruising furniture now so I'm sure in a month or so she'll accidently let go and take off.  Two of my others were early (the other three were 12-13 months).  I think they have a little better sense of self-preservation when they are older.  Nine month olds walk off the ends of steps, furniture, etc and don't seem to get the fact they are going to fall.  Not much else doing today.  My oldest dd is trying to finish 4-H so we have 3 batches of biscuits to eat.  I made some pumpkin muffins too so I guess snacks are taken care of.  I better not blink or it will be my now 8month old doing 4-H projects.  Time really does go faster when you have kids.

      Well, nothing like starting a blog and then not writing for days.  But I had a reason I swear!  This past weekend was our little town's summer festival.  It coincides with the 4th of July every year.  So.. on Thursday evening we went to the park to watch the kids' baseball coaches in an exhibition/pick up game and stayed to watch the fireworks.  Friday evening was the parade.  My dh worked so I took the littlest two to watch the oldest four.  Of course I then had to shell out money so they could walk around with their friends.  It's always a good time and a great opportunity to catch up with people you haven''t seen in awhile.  Saturday the oldest two had to help with the 4-H cakewalk and I took the youngest four to the kiddie carnival.  It was HOT!!  We came home and had popsicles and got in the pool.  Saturday evening a rodeo was scheduled.  I looked out and decided it was going to rain and having all six at  a crowded rodeo in the rain didn't sound like fun.  My oldest dd still wanted to go so she got a ride with a friend.  Sure enough it poured.  She came home an hour and a half later totally soaked.  Ah, youth.  Sunday was a community church service, water ball fights and kid's games in the fire hose.  We of course let off our own fireworks/sparklers/bottle rockets etc at night.  A good end to a holiday and festival.  Today I took my ten year old ds to a friend's house to stay until they are tired of him.  I took the opportunity to stop at Walmart and buy all the stuff I never seem to get bought.  Tomorrow the girl I babysit will be back and things should be back to normal, or what passes for normal here anyway.

      Ds 8 made breakfast for dd5 and ds3 this morning.  I heard him from the bedroom. C I want more milk! C I want more syrup! Where's the fork? Can I have a napking? I want another waffle!  Me too!  Geez you guys, no wonder mom's so grumpy!    LOL, and I thought they were just inconsiderate to me.    Not too much else happened today.  E got her haircut and then had me highlight it.  She seems happy with it (which is good because if she started whining about it I would have had to snatch her bald.) The three boys have complained I only ever e-mail or post pictures of the girls so I'm endeavoring to be fair and include them.  This was taken outside church camp while we were waiting to pick up their sister.  The two oldest boys go to camp in two weeks.  The quiet will probably drive me crazy....after 24 hours or so.

      Ok, it's only noon and I've wreaked destruction all morning in my effort to be productive.  I started mowing at 7:00.  That was great except I hit the top of the sewer tap and sheared it off.  Ooops!  Dh will not be happy.  I'll try to convince him that the galvanized bucket adds charm to the side yard.  I came in and shampooed the bathroom carpet, hung out the towels, threw in more laundry and then tried to fold up the octagonal play yard thing.  It snapped, another oops.  So, I went to run errands...and scraped up the wheel cover thing.  I would just go back to bed and start over but I need to shower and take ds S and ds C to the dentist, oh yeah and make a list of things needed for our vacation, and take everything out of the freezer so I can move it when the contractor comes, probably next week when I'm on said vacation...sigh.  And move all the rest of the stuff off the back porch and get dd to her double header softball game at 5:00.  That will eat up the whole evening until 9:00.  Well tomorrow is another day (that was my best Scarlett imitation by the way :-)   )

      I have been sick since Sunday evening with a kidney infection.  Ack!!  While I laid around the kids played and played and played which was good.  Of course  laundry, cleaning, etc fell far behind.  Now that I am up I'll need to bring the house out of its spin into entropy.  I didn't feel up to going to 8yo ds's baseball game last night.  Of course it was the game where he got hit in the eye with a ball.  He has a heck of a shiner.  Every game I do go to nothing happens.  It must not be our family's week either because 12yo dd got hit by a pitch at softball.  But hey, she did get a base.   All the playing and swimming did have one good effect on 5yo dd, she fell asleep outside playing.   and of course the baby continued to be cute

      Hmmm, how does the weekend disappear so quickly?  Saturday was biscuits, biscuits and more biscuits.  Somehow 4-H always sounds like a good experience in March and by July when they are trying to get all the projects done perfectly it stinks?  (And why does everything involve turning the oven on to 450 degrees when it's ninety outside.)  The oldest two spent almost all day working.  I finally got groceries.  As a reward we went to the drive-in to see Shrek II and Harry Potter.  It was lots of fun except for the mosquitoes and 5yo dd throwing up.  She did manage to do it in a shopping bag and not on the van seat so that was at least a plus. I taught Sunday School today.  We only have to teach every third month  and I have the 3-6 yo so it's not too taxing.  I worked on Mt. Washmore today.  Got everyone's sheets and all the towels washed while I could hang them to dry.  Of course they were all done for about 2 minutes until everyone got back in the pool.  So here it is Sunday evening already.  It seems like I should have more to show for a weekend.

      That is what I accomplished today.  I also realize I have no amusing way to say that.  Sorry, for hip cutting edge blogging you'll have to look elsewhere.  Dh and I went out for a coffee, he took L and F to the park.  Then he took E, S and C to "I, Robot".  I sat in the yard enjoying the weather.  Yesterday I needed gills to breathe, today was like May. I let A explore the sandbox for the first time.  I don't even think she ate much sand.  So now I'm sitting here nursing a vodka tonic and feeling the sleeping weight of A on my shoulder.  Not edgy and hip but pretty darn nice.

      OK, we never actually left Indiana but you get the idea.  After 3 days at an amusement park/water park we are home.  I am now officially exhausted.  Dh very "generously" offerred to watch the 3 littlest while I went with the 3 older ones on rides, etc.  Then when I was good and tired he offerred to switch.  He lost the 3 year old twice (grr).  He also took the oldest two back to the park for late night fun while I stayed in the room with cranky little kids.  I very carefully made sure all the children and dh applied sunscreen and (DUH!) forgot to put some on me so I was the one who got sunburned. I also took my camera and then forgot to take one single picture.  Hey at least I can't bore you with pics of my vacation. ;-)  The kids really had fun though.  Even C, my 8yo, who is never visibly pleased announced he was happy.  He is never happy.  So that in itself was worth the hassle. We managed to arrive home in the middle or a huge thunderstorm.  We lost power at 11:00 (darn, can't finish the laundry tonight) and it came back on at 5:27 this morning.  I know this because everything that had been on suddenly kicked back to life.  Scared the bejeebers out of me.  We had to be up at 6:00 anyway to deliver E and S's 4-H projects for judging.  We didn't stay for judging though because I had to take S to the doctor.  He managed to get swimmer's ear and a secondary infection on top of it.  Hmmm, why do I think sending him to camp next week to swim in a lake/pond might not be such a good idea.  Well that about covers my mundane, middle class, middle american vacation.  Now I need to rest up for the next expedition whenever that may be.

      It was a pretty lazy Sunday here.  We got home from church and after a sandwich all the kids went out to play.  I sat on the swing and watched them swim and swing and play football and blow bubbles. For half and hour or so I was convinced that perhaps they will grow up to be interesting adults with close ties to their siblings, then they reverted to type, fighting and arguing and I was once more sure that we are way more "Roseanne" than the "Waltons".  I came back in to start packing for our trip.  We are to leave tomorrow at 7:00.  I really want to leave by 8:00 so I'm saying 7:00 so we get out on time.  The rest of my afternoon was spent packing clothes, food, medicines, etc.  I remember being 20 and leaving for the weekend with just a clean pair of underwear in my purse.  Ah, those carefree days are gone.  The oldest 3 did pack for themselves but I knew I'd have to check it. Sure enough, dss 10 and 8 had cds and players, game boys, yuhioh cards, a deck of regular cards and a t-shirt a piece .  When I came back down stairs I found Mel at the back door.  Her expression was clear that if she could just get that door open she'd be outside too.   That's all for now.  I'm leaving you with a pic of my wildflowers.  It's sort of like a test pattern.  It's a little humbling to remember test patterns, lol!

         This is what is left of our back porch and patio.  It has taken two and a half very large dumpsters and lots of noise to get to this point.  While I'm really looking forward to the finished product I'm sure the next couple months are going to drive me crazy.  They did fill in the old cistern in the back which puts my mind at rest about that at least.  I was always afraid one of the kids would find a way to fall in it.   Next week they will be tearing off our current utility room.  It is really an old porch someone put chipboard around.  Not pretty but I will be without a washer and dryer.  I can hardly wait to make trips to the laundromat, YUCK!  I have been trying for the last couple of weeks to get up early and walk before the baby and the little kids get up.  This means walking at 5:30am.  I'm waiting for that energy boost that comes from being in shape.  I must be very out of shape because all I feel is a need for a nap.  Since we have a dumpster available I have been trying to weed out the garage.  Last spring it flooded so things are moldy and muddy.  Truly disgusting.  I have also been trying to decide whether to save some baby stuff.  I probably won't ever need it again but I have never gotten rid of baby stuff.  I'm not sure I'm constitutionally able to do it.  Afterall, dh might feel less old one of these evenings and my soon to be 42 year old body might cooperate.  I need to go through boxes of things from the garage.  I have found 4-H and sporting ribbons, my old school letters, photo albums.  Maybe I'll spread it out, take a digi pic of it and get rid of the real thing.  What is a middle aged woman doing hanging on to basketball and gymnastic ribbons for??  Inertia I guess.  And I thought I reduced when we moved four years ago.    Well, back to the black hole of a garage.  If I never post again you'll know where to look for me.....

      what I have done today.  1.  Arose at 6:00am to make cinnamon rolls, get up all children, feed, water and dress said children.     2.  Pack belongings in van and drive 1 1/2 hours to camp.  Spend one hour standing in line checking in dss.  Drive back home with detour to..  3.  Pick up old metal bunkbed from friends to replace the garage sale wooden bunkbeds kids have been sleeping in for 6 years.. continue home after wedging them in around remaining 4 children.  4.  Try to give children lunch (even though it's 1:30 and they have been starved for hours).  5.  Move van with bunkbed frames still inside so that contractor can bust up our concrete back porch and steps to begin our construction.  6.  Give up on anyone including baby taking a nap while large jackhammer is going outside kitchen.  7.  Make dinner after cacophony stops at 5:30.  Feed very tired children dinner, bathe nurse and soothe (which includes watching Thomas AGAIN!!! and Veggie Tales) until the little darlings fall asleep.  8.  Do dishes, do laundry, explain to 12yodd why she cannot spend the night in the hog barn at the fair.  9.  Drum roll please.... drop into computer chair.  How could the day be so full and so little be accomplished???   Truly one of the mysteries of motherhood.

      I need to take S and C to camp tomorrow.  They are packed and ready.  E is staying the night with a friend tonight.  It would seem (if I were the paranoid type) that my children can't wait to get out of here.    We went to the 4-H fair today to check on the kids' projects.  They did really well, lots of blue ribbbons and even a couple special merit ribbons.  I have been trying to be more productive around here.  I hate things getting away from me around the house but I also hate not getting to play on my 'puter.  I think I have become blog addicted.  I am now more caught up on strangers lives than I am my family.  That is probably very sick, or geeky, or both!    What else..my babysitting gig starts again tomorrow, P has to go back to work, and I have to get out of my little vacation frame of mind where it's just me and P and the kids, which is just how I like it. Now that I have sickened all my single childless friends who are wondering how I became so sappy and insipid I will go to bed :-P      F has that manly pose down and L looks like such a pris (which she is NOT)

      My little construction worker is eating up all the great mud to play in...    but a hard day of construction sure makes you tired    The actual construction seems to be going pretty well.  Thank God the destruction part is mostly over.  We have lost our cable TV, which means all TV.  So far the weather has been good and no one has complained but if it turns rainy I'm sure to hear some complaints.  Actually we had no power most of yesterday and some of Wednesday.  We'll soon be as Amish as our builders.  Ds 8 is going to a sleepover/birthday party tonight.  It is the first one he has gone to.  He is not a very social animal so hopefully he will do fine.    DD 12 is grounded so she will be home tonight.  I'm not sure I remember the last time she was home or didn't have someone stay here on Friday.  It's the first time she's ever been grounded.  I usually take away TV or computer or something for the boys but she just seems too old for that now so no phone, IM or seeing friends for her this weekend.  I'm not sure sentencing myself to her teenage attitude was all that smart on my part though :-).  L,5 yo dd, seems fine now so I guess I can put off that call to the priest.    Mel has learned to stand up all by herself in the middle of the room, no pulling up on furniture.  I know walking won't be far behind now.  I really am trying to snuggle and enjoy every baby minute but she just keeps growing faster and faster.  Well, I need to go see if I can concoct something for dinner.  If you read enough blogs you begin to feel everyone is a better parent, a better cook, a better wife, funnier, wittier, wiser than you.  I'm just stating for the record here, I'm drowning in mediocrity and I'm pretty happy about it!!

      You know the saying "Somedays the sh*t falls down so hard you need a hat."?  Well today I needed a sombrero!  Nothing huge just tons of little things. They tore off my former utility room today, sending clouds of really gross dust and dirt everywhere.  It was very hot and humid and I couldn't put on a fan because it just pushed the dirt and dust around more.  I just gave up and went outside.  There was no point in trying to clean it up until they were done.  I now have a lovely blue tarp where my wall used to be.  Because it was so hot I decided as a treat I'd take the kids to a local swimming spot in what used to be a quarry.  It has a shallow sandy spot put in for little kids and the biggers can go dive off a raft.  All was well until 5yo dd L decided to have the mother of all fits.  I mean a screaming, crying, running away, throwing yourself down, slapping, head spinning fit!!! (Ok, maybe her head didn't spin but it was close.)  I've seen many fits but this just might take the cake.  And the topper is nobody seems to know what the problem was.  So I'm sure we made a lovely picture...Me trying to carry screamming dd (after I managed to get ahold of her), 12yo dd carrying baby, 10yo ds carrying 3yo, 8yo ds and 8yo babysitting child loaded with towels, noodles and a baby boat.  Sigh.... I sent 5yo to her room where she passed out from exhaustion underneath her bed, wiped, wiped, and wiped the kitchen and am now enjoying a much deserved beer.  Hopefully tomorrow I'll feel I'm raising loving children and not the girl from the Exorcist.

      You know the phrase "The hurrier I go the behinder I get."?  That pretty much sums up the last few days.  I returned from the 10th circle of hell aka my garage attic.  I beleive I have finally finished in there.  I picked up my dss 10 and 8 from camp Saturday.  That ate about 5 hours out of the morning.  I was then faced with the dilemma of burning or actually washing all the laundry they brought back.  About load 7 later I realized I had made the wrong decision.  I also went to a friend's house to check out her garage sale leftovers.  E got several pair of jeans in the very hard to find size 0 and a cute fall jacket.  I turned down a bread machine.  She kept saying "..but it makes a two pound loaf."  Hmm, that might do us one meal.  It's much easier to bake up 3 loaves at a time in the oven.  Hmmm, where was I... today was church and then I left my messy house and had some fun gosh darn it with the kids.  I took all 6 and E's friend L swimming at the community pool.  I kept Mel in her little inflatable boat (her floaty boaty) and she had a great time.  The littlest 3 stayed with me in the middle size pool and the older 4 took off for the water slides and diving boards.  I called it quits about 4:30 though because we had to get back for a carry in/talent show at church.  We ate there, helped clean up and watched E and L try to soak up as much limelight as they could.  It amazes me that my boys would rather have their eyelids removed than get up in front of people and my two older girls will run over you to get to the stage.  Oh, and I came off like a big poop because I wouldn't let the sweet old ladies holding Mel stuff her full of ice cream.  They probably think I'm full of newfangled ideas, lol.  Tomorrow E and S have basketball camp.  It's not that big of a deal but I find when I know I have to stop what I'm doing in two hours to leave I don't start big projects.  Of course they have it at different times so that means four trips out of the house.  Oh well, it will get me back in form for the school (YUCK!) year.

      I'm not sure what the deal is with the weather.  It was 47 degrees last night.  I'm ready to build a fire and make cocoa for heaven sake when I should be having a midnight swim and iced tea!  The construction goes on and on....  I did discover the original door frame.  Why oh why did people "update" in the '70's.  It is all carved and has a transom. It is really cool but not in such great shape after being stuck under aluminum siding for 30 years.  Maybe I can take the lintel piece and pry it off to make some sort of wall art.  I'm not sure.   I got the kid's back packs ready with all the school supplies they needed.  I cannot believe they go back to school on Wednesday. I suppose it will get nicely hot when they return.  I so don't want them to go back.  It's nice to have them all around and not have to live on the school's schedule.  I strongly considered calling the school and telling them not to look for my kids before Labor Day, lol!  Seriously, oldest dd E will be in the 7th grade.  She has asked about home schooling but I'm afraid I'd end up letting it slide or be so afraid of letting it slide I'd become a homeschool nazi.  We'll see.  I've been fighting a bad case of baby fever today.  Mel is just so darn cute I can't imagine not having another.  Dh really is concerned about his age though..., we'll see, men can be weak ;-)

      Just some things I've found amusing the last few days.  In the midst of the mess any humor found is good.  Three yo ds insists on telling everyone about his new "shoot gun" (water pistol).  DD 5 has a b-day on the 24th.  She is asking for "an old crown with real jewels.  Not a cheap tacky one mom."  Geez, maybe too many dollar store gifts?  Finally, because we have no TV and I won't let the kids play outside while cement mixers and backhoes are tooling around the back yard, we all sit in the kitchen watching the Amish construction guys dig, float cement, etc.  DS 10 has dubbed this "Amish TV".  I hear them talking in the other room "hey, when this game of Yugioh is done, wanna go watch Amish TV?"
