						   Last night I was supposed to go to NYC with my younger sis to take in some of the jazz nightlife. Instead we arranged to have her guy friend and the musician come along. At the last minute, my sister decided to drop out then so did her guy friend. This left the night to be another 'date' type thing with the musician.  I went to his place and we ordered in. We had chicken. YUM! [my favorite]. Then we watched the movie 'Heat' and talked.  During the movie, we cuddled and the like. I am an affection person, and I like to be close to a guy I like, I'm glad he was receptive to this. It was nice. We had a peck here and there and he just wanted to convince himself that my lipgloss was really watermelon tasting. lol. After the movie he played some music, I love how he just never gets bored of it. Then around 1:30am he walked me back to my car, as I was starting to get very sleepy. The goodbye was short this time, a peck and a hug and a 'have a good night' was all that we exchanged. He has been persistent in determining what it is I think of everything, yet he has not told me what he thinks. Hmmm...

						   Last night I went on a 'date' with a musician. It's been over 5 years since I last dated a musician. I grew up my entire life with music. I was a musician, I played Alto Sax for 15 years, piano for 9 and viola for 7. I went to a Conservatory for college. Everyone in college was a musician, actor/actress or dancer. Dating a musician was an extrememly competitive relationship. I gave up on musicians abt 5 years ago and opted for jocks. Quite an extreme change, but it worked. I met my jock and lived with him for 5 years. Since him, I've only been interested in the JOCK/Manly-Man type.  This musician I met, was an exception. He was very passionate about his music and extrememly accomplished. I was impressed. I have not played music in 5 years...so dating a musician now seems to be less competitive now.   I'm happy,  It was raining. I'm sorry...It was POURING. The 25 minute drive took me 2 hours last night. Accidents along the way and lightening that struck the ground causing a small fire right in front of me, .. i thought this was a sign that I shouldn't meet him...but I did. When i arrived at the parking lot, I met him, he had a small umbrella and was drenched. I got out of my car to let the parkers park. He grabbed me close to him so that I could fit under the umbrella with him. It was nice. I felf comfortable.  He gave me 4 choices. Indian/Thai/Ethiopian/Italian cuisine. I was going to opt for the Italian since I didn't dare even cosider the other 3. We walked slowly in the pouring rain to get to the Indian restaurant. This was the first time that I ever ate this type. I liked how he was considerate of my tastes, and new I didn't like spicy food/seafood or steak/pork...we had chicken and nan and this cucumber topping thingy, also had rice/potatoes and couliflower. YUM! It was delicious, I felt so intercultured.  He even asked "If you feel comfortable enough, I'd like to play some music for you and maybe watch a movie, if you like." Of course, I said yes.  We went back to his apartment and the 400 sq ft / $2300/month rent apartment was packed with music/dvds everything. He played tons of music for me even wrote a song and recorded it right then and there which he named after me. We also watch Bowling for Columbine considering Farhenheit 911 just came out.  I've heard of Michael Moore, but only from his escapade at the Oscars.  He's got some interesting view points and a lot of 'pull'. After the music and movies, he walked me back to my car around 2:30 am, stopping along the way to just hug me. I loved that. He gave me a quick kiss on the lips and I was amazingly at ease and satisfied. Back to my car we went and said our goodbyes, now looking forward to another evening with him tonight at a jazz club.

						   A bit about me. I'm 24, 1/2 Japanese 1/2 Italian. I'm short... pushing 5'1" actually. I'm proud of my shortness and my small feet.  I have long hair and it's dark, ... black, to be exact. I'm also proud of that. I like to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars a year on hair products and makeup, particularly lipglosses in shades of pink.  Pink is my favorite color, not light pink, not dark pink, not magenta or fuschia...just plain old pink.  I love marshmallows and everything white. Although I love the COLOR pink, I love all objects that I own to be one of the primary colors...or white. I would be happy in a white room, with white furniture, white carpeting with white sheer curtains on the windows, halogen lamps lighting the room up full blast and a white bichon frise puppy running around on the carpet chasing a white ball.  I'm single. Have been single since Dec. 7th, 2003, which just so happens to be 'Pearl Harbor Day'. It's was just coincidental that I am part Japanese and my ex claims that I did the typical Japanese sneak attack on him, when I broke the news. My ex and I are still civil.  I lived on my own for 5 years and since I broke up with my ex, I moved back in with ma for a new start. It's been quite an adjustment and dating from this perspective, has been quiet interesting. I have dated nearly 25 men January 1 to the day of this entry. I like to learn, hence the reason for meeting and dating so many men.  I want to share my stories. They are funny, and I like to laugh at myself, so I figure...why not let the world laugh at me while I'm at it.
