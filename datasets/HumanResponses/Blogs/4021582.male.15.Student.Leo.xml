") Aft sch... went to haf some western rice? and aft tt some drinks and some stupid auntie served wit stupid and shout stupidly at me... could not help to talked back and stare at her.. she jus suck... and we went back to class.. and my stomach was making some strange noise... tt made me stood at toilet for some time... it was unbearable... hating to return to class... but i stil did... looking at the smiling mdm rubyiah.... i smiled adn returned to seat... tired and slept and woke up in a min... and the day carried on.. and i drew a 'art' for her.. and she was quite pleased with it... how nice.. she said tt i cld be a good drawer..... or an artist? thanks teacher...

'out or in'? sab said... definitely out.. i guess.. and sent her to bus stop... and before tt.. i didnt noe.. why she was jus so pissed off... i got into exclamation.... and i tried my best to overcome it... but my face stil let it out... troubles came... i got into thinking... waiting for her call when she reached home.. i called and called.. smsed and smsed... i felt something definitely so wrong.. tt is so accurate and the things jus happened... and after my meal.. i called her and she picked up... telling that she planned to lie to me... of no particular reason... i hate lying... i cldnt bear it to question.... cause the feeling jus sucked.. reaching home wit a stomach ache... venting anger on myself by doing push ups... i didnt know wat of my actions did not follow my words.... i was wordless.... speachless.. and in a dilemma.... sms her and asked.. so many sms.. bout wat and why did she lie for... m i such a good bullier? wat did i do wrong? and so ttt retribution striked and i didnt even do anithin wrong.. and she is tryin to find fault? was it tt i promised her not to play when we are studyin? i played wit mh... but... it was alright.... god damn.. it was jus a small prob... why find fault? so pissed off.. trying to find someone to talk to... i had came to a situation.. i was talking to the air and myself when i was walking home.. silently and slowly... i talked to myself... 'was i such a pain? or was i a liar.? tt she had to test me? or did she had any doubt on me?' i tried to explain to  myself... but i cant... asking her... she jus say it is so diff to say..  i didnt noe why.. but i jus need to know.. any thing but lie... i didnt had any mood for the day... and now i m so tired... mentally... i tink... something is going to be put to an end... jus.. i cant bear it... its tiring and tey i didnt mind to endure.. but why must she put on more to me? i didnt noe... i was sad.. but... onli viewers off my blog noes..  I tried my best in givin all i can... Healing myself after a little hurt... Even a diety takes some time.... Why cant i even haf a little time.... To even heal my tiny wound u created...
