      I am not supposed to be doing this, but I'm interested in finding out how long it takes for my actions to come back and bite me on the ass. Heh, heh, heh. I am the evil warlord your mother warned you about. I shall destroy the village and take your women to do my bidding.

      I sit here at my computer after 8 pm at night talking to my sister.   We pondered what ever happened to the unspoken rule that you couldn't engage in "Christmas" activity ie have a christmas sale or start playing christmas music on the radio?  next thing you know it will be christmas sales all year long.  Its crazy I say.  Just another blatant display of the complete secularization of Christmas the feeling of the season has totally been lost for the shear consumer driven maelstrom powered by walmart and the malls of america!    P.S.  If you are buying me presents this year I'd like a set of show shoes.

      So I just saw my brother's entry on my blog, and, of course, I must reciprocate. I'm still on the Dayquill, so maybe this will be an interesting post. Don't know because I'm slowing getting my wits back. Bummer. So Mikey's in Texas, eh? Stupid jerk!!! Why does he get to drink beer in the sunshine and I have to freeze my ass like some kind of Innuit? I don't understand just how cosmic justice is meted out. Today's Ash Wendesday, so have to go to church tonight and get a little dirty. Yeah, you don't know what kind of fun we Catholics can haveâ€”go to church, get some dirt smeared on you, rub it in real good. Yeah, that's something to talk about. K, my shift's up, gotta go.

      Of course, my brother thinks he's playing a little trick on me by making an entry on my blog because he thinks I've been slacking. Well, two can play that game, I say. Of course the George Foreman grill rocks, do I buy non-rocking gifts for my family. NO! I am the queen of rockalicious gift-giving. But, I pretty much rock all the way around. I'm so rockin', they call me Granite, Miss Jackson if you're nasty. Know what I mean? So, my brother wants to know how long it takes me to see his entry, let's see how long it takes him to find mine. Heh, heh, heh.

      Yes fans thats right my sister knits.  She's actually quite a good knitter!  I want her to knit me a nice sweater so I can wear it out and when people ask me, "where did you get that magnificant sweater!"  I can reply,  "My sister knitted it for me its a one of a kind!".  well,  I'm going to go back to work now because thats what pays the bills.   I'll probably be back in a couple of hours when my carpel tunnel syndrome calms down a bit.  Ok so I don't have carpel tunnel syndrome.  But my arm is sore.

      I am so bored. I am so bored. I asked my brother to hook me up with another interview, but I haven't heard from him. I am bored, bored, bored. (sound of random whistling). I wish I would have brought my knitting with me, then at least I could do something.

      Yes I'm here at my desk counting down the days that I am left here in HELL better known as DelaWhere?   Yes I will be back in the land of milk and honey aka Washington DC!  yeah I'm going to be living with my girlfriend for the next two months until I move into my house.  I'm actually pretty excited about that whole notion because then I can spend lots and lots of time with her.  Which is excellent in my opinion.    Make up for some of the time we've been apart.  Which I like a lot.

      My brother sucks, yet again. Why does he get to go to Italy for a week while I am stuck in this Midwestern hell? Anyway, get me something good when you're there. Something you can't get in the states, you know like a Pope bobblehead or something. Get me some chocolate too.

      Duh, na, na, na, na, na. You say it's your birthday. It's my birthday too.  So little Mikey turns the big 3-0 on Saturday and is FREAKED OUT!!! Poor little Mikey, all grown-up and nowhere to go. To celebrate this momentous event, I'd like to share some of my most treasured memories from the past thirty years.  At the tender age of 27, the age/weight guesser at King's Dominion places Mike's age at 14. Mike wins a large stuffed fish.  Ages 18-24, Mike takes the scenic route through college by attending three schools in six years before earning his degree.  At age 18, Mike starts a new trend at school by taking his lunch to school in a Sesame Street lunchbox. This apparently sparks a flame of nostalgia among his friends and soon every teenager in Centreville, VA is sporting this cool new look.  At age 17, Mike gets sooooooo angry at me that he snaps my toothbrush in half in order to show off his machismo power. Grrrrrrrr! I am He-Man.  At age 16, Mike gets wasted--I mean wasted--the night before he and I are scheduled to fly out to Florida for the weekend. He is so wasted, he pukes up the advil we give him to try and somehow make him feel better. Mike begs me not to tell our parents because they won't let him go to Florida if they find out. I grapple with my conscious for quite a long time and agree to keep silent, all the while hoping and praying that he doesn't die of alcohol poisoning during the night. He makes it through the night and is rewarded the next day by experiencing first class flying for the first time. He is very, very impressed with the real salt and pepper shakers that come with his meal.  At approximately age 12 or so, Mike slashes tires on base with a couple of delinquent friends that he runs around with and gets into really big trouble. I don't recall what my father did, but I don't think it was good.  At age 4 we move to Germany and Mike appears at our apartment door two days into our stay, having lugged an "inchworm" rider up four flights of stairs to announce, "I found this on the playground. Can I keep it?"  At age 2, my aunts, my sister and I dress-up Mike in our old dresses and curl his hair. He makes a lovely little girl.  Memories, like the corners of my mind. Misty water-colored memories of the way we were. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, G. :-)

      The problem with letting people have information like your passwords and login names is that they take advantage of it, don't they? I mean, look at me. I just changed the template for my brother's blog. The other one was boring, I thought. But there you go. I'm invading his territory and I'm telling you about it. At least I'm an honest meddler. That's saying something, isn't it?

      So the rents are meeting the rents, huh? Make sure Dad pulls his pants up extra high to set the right mood. I'm going to tell Tim to act like Jack Black from Orange County when Christina's parents get there. I think that will be really funny. :-)

      So last weekend I went with my Girlfriend to go visit her relatives in Tennessee.  They live up in the hill country and are really some very kind and fun people.  I have never met small town people who have lived in their same town all their lives.  However,  I must say they are quite interesting and entertaining people.  Some of the quirky issues of small town life I find quite neat.  Well This week my parents and my girlfriends parents are meeting for the very first time!  what do you think about that!  I'm fairly excited.  Its a step in a direction I really want to go down!  I'm really stoked!

      they have finished the construction across the way from my office window.  My hours of entertainment watching him raise and lower all sorts of construction items is over.  What will I do to entertain myself!  I suppose I will have to buy myself a telescope to spy on the people in the office building.  See what evil depraved things they do in their cubes!!!!

      I am sitting here and I am bored. I still feel a little self-consious about putting anything real here because I really don't like the idea of just anyone seeing what I write.   I'm looking out my office window and it's gray outside. It's been storming and there are drops of rain trapped in the window screen. I can also see pools of water on the tops of buildings below me. I don't like rain. It's puts me in a bad mood. Sunshine is better. It clears the mind and makes you remember it can be good to smell fresh air and look at the sky.  In the haze of the horizon I see the blinking light on a cellular phone tower.  Leaves are only now beginning to fill out the trees; it's been a long winter.

      OK, so it's taken a little explanation from my brother, but now I know that this is like a diary. A diary that anyone can see. First I should warn you, I like to make up stories, so you'll never quite know if I'm telling you the truth or not. But now that I'm up to speed (it can sometimes take awhile), I'll know to divulge all my really juicy secrets for your entertainment.

      What drains the passion from a person? There used to be a time when there wasn't enough time for me to say all the things I wanted to. Now, I can hardly think of anything worth saying. I've been thinking about the hair story I started some time ago and have been feeling a little interested in working on it and seeing where it goes. The main problem is I'm not entirely sure what I want it to talk about. At the time I started it, I was playing with the idea of how asian beauty is processed in the American psyche, which I still think is a good motivator. But what do I want to say about it. I think there are still a lot of stereotypes about people of asian decent in America--primarily that they are somehow still foreign and not actually from America. People always ask where are you from. What's your nationality? As if America and American cannot be the answer. So we're back to the way asian beauty is processed and how asian woman view themselves in relation to the American ideals of beauty. I like to see how the "hipper" asian women do things like have their eyes widened and dye their hair blonde. I should say Korean women, because I don't know if Japanese-, Chinese-, etc.-American women do these things. But Korean-American women love looking good. They love their DKNY, they love their cellphones, they love their platform shoes, they love their razor-sharp hairstyles, they love their cosmetic tattoos.

      I've been thinking lately I should concentrate more on my writing—my real writing—not this thing. I'm feeling the old desire creep up on me again. The question is what's the story? In a lot of ways, you're always writing. The stories are turning round in your head and they never stop. It's just easier to let them run their course in the brain rather than put them down on paper. But the stories are there. I used to feel really passionately about a lot of things and none of those things seem so important anymore.   Last week I was watching some teenagers at the mall and they were dressed up in prom outfits and they were all very conspicuous because how can you not be in prom clothes at the mall. Obviously the dance was being held somewhere in the mall because there were a lot of kids. When my friends and I saw the first couple of them, we thought the boys had decided to take their dates to dinner there and we wondered would you want to be taken to the mall for your prom dinner. We all decided no, but then we started seeing more of them walking around while they held hands trying to look as glamorous as the clothes they were wearing.   The girls all wore strapless gowns or, at most, spaghetti straps. I guess I'm entering the phase of my life where I begin thinking like my parents because I wondered how their mothers let them leave the house in outfits that bared so much. Not that they really did bare so much, but I don't think I would have felt comfortable wearing a strapless gown at 16. I don't think I'd feel comfortable wearing a strapless gown now at 34. Mainly because you're pulling up on the thing all night long and it's just not worth the aggravation.  But it was nice to watch the girls and see in their faces the look that on this one night they got to be beautiful. They got to be fancy and dressed up and beautiful. The boys all looked puffed  up and ridiculous as they most often do, but the girls were all beautiful and happy.

      I am really tired right now. I've gotten the worst sleep in the last few days. I don't know why, but it sucks. My back hurts, too. I've been thinking a lot lately of the vulgar, in terms of what makes something vulgar. It's a concept I think I'd like to explore further. Is it just dirty talk? No, I don't think so. I only wonder about it because people often think they can find beauty in the disgusting. I don't know if it's because to imagine something repugnant, you have to imagine the opposite, otherwise it couldn't exist. It all seems to tie into a kind of rapture to me. You get lost in the incredibly vulgar and the incredibly pure in the same way, I think. There's a similar attraction to the essence of something that forces you to look at it and examine it and let it run between your fingers.

      I will say this much, though. I feel very strongly about getting the word out on my recent Harry Potter addiction. I've gotten hooked after listening the audio books in the car with my husband and daughter on road trips and it's been very hard getting other things done when I want to be reading the book. There, I re-did that much.

      I don't believe this, the entire post I just wrote is gone. I lost it somehow before managing to put in on my site. Crap! It was really brialliant, too. He, he, he. No, but really, it was brilliant I tell you. Should I bother trying to write it out again or not? Probably not, the muse only hits every now and again.

      I smell mold.  I hope its not me.  cuz I'd smell moldy if it was.  This may be because I left my clothes in the washing machine too long before drying them.  oh well.  such is life.  yet again the dillema of what to read whilst I deuce deuce it!

      What is it that I am thinking?  Well, as a Korean Celt, I'm thinking.....Why are my siblings so weird?  Why is it that we all say weird things, and, somehow, we all laugh, because we know exactly what it is we're talking about?  I want to be rich and famous, but it'll never happen, because I don't love myself enough to make it happen...I'm all about my kids being rich and famous, because then I don't actually have to work for it.  Yes, I'm a lazy behatch!  I gotta go get those rich and famous kids, now.  CYA!

      what did I think about today. . . .   man what is appropriate reading material for when I take a deuce at the office.  and then I analyze the best bathroom to go to the bathroom in where I will find the least amount of disturbance.  If you were wondering its the one down across the atrium.  No one ever uses that bathroom.  I also thought about how excited I am to move back to VA and be doe with delaWHERE?  I'd also like to be rich.  but not famous so much I prefer my anonimity.  so I can do fun stuff and not get caught for it.  It has worked for me so far.  well my carpel tunnel is acting up so I'm gone.   *poof*

      OK, I obviously have too much time on my hands today, but I was just wondering why someone's nose bone would be crooked if they'd never broken their nose. My nose is that way but I know I've never broken it. Just one of those strange things I wonder about.

      This is what I've been thinking about. Why we dwell on things. What purpose does it serve. Sometimes I think I'm going crazy from thinking about stuff that's happened in my life. I think about people from the past and wonder if I ever enter their minds.   I've been asking the Magic 8-Ball a lot of questions lately about my future. Am I going to ever publish a book, will I ever be rich and famous. That kind of stuff, because I really do believe one day I'll be rich and famous. And I figure there's got to be something to it because normal people don't just imagine they'll be rich and famous one day.   I think people wonder about their future because they can't see how their present is going to get them to where they imagine they'd like to be. I think about the time I'm wasting now, just letting things happen and going along with the status quo and I really don't think I like it. We all think there's something special about us, something that really differentiates us from the people around us. But, really, maybe there's nothing. Yeah, I want to be a rock star.

      I'm bored, bored, bored, bored. This is the part they don't tell you about when you're a kid. They don't tell you that sometimes you just sit in your office looking off into space because there's really nothing more interesting to do. Sometimes I wish I could just chuck everything and run through the streets like a child of the night. I always remember getting drunk fondly, but whenever I actually do it anymore, I'm really hating life. Why do we have to grow up? Whine, whine, whine.

      I HATE Indiana!!! It's freaking 597 degrees below zero. Or something like that, anyway. This states SUCKS, SUCKS, SUCKS. I've got frost covering the interior window frames in my office. I'm literally working inside something that strongly resembles a freezer. At least the sunshine is finally out. But it's cold. The kind of cold that makes the snot freeze into little booger pellets inside your nose. It doesn't even get the chance to run out. It just freezes right where it it.

      So its is now January 27th of our new year 2004!  My sister has gotten a little slack in her duties to the oh great blog she has here.  So I thought I'd contribute something for her.  P.S.  My george foreman grill is the bomb.  I really like it a lot.  I cook chicken breasts with it every night.  it really does the trick!  good for making reubens too.  in case you were wondering.   But I digress.  So I am waiting to be transfered to VA to take on my new job working in RESTON.  I hate it here.  because they are all a bunch of lamo un motivated stupid people who waste my time and my energy with completely unecessary minutae!  It drives me crazy I want to strangle people sometimes.  Anyways enough with the rant.  I'll see how long it takes for my sister to read this I'd be interested to find out.

      OK, so what was I saying. Yeah, well so there's this boy in my daughter's class who she's friends with and she thinks he doesn't like her anymore because when she tries to go up to him, apparently he runs away. She's really bummed about it, but I just don't know what to tell her because in the end, she has to either be satisfied with playing with someone else or ask him why he isn't treating her so well. Neither one of these options seems appealing to her. She's really sensitive when it comes to thinking someone might not like her. I tell her that it's their loss, but I don't think she gets it. I feel bad for her, but I want her to figure this one out on her own because it won't be the last time in her life she has to deal with issues like this. Boys will always be stupid.

      K, I'm on Dayquill. Is that how it's spelled? I am kind of wigging out right now. I'm really tired and sorta spacing. Last night, when I was on the Ny-quill (I know that's not spelled right) everything seemed really slow. That's the best thing about it. Everything sort of feels like it's happening in a dream, but it's not. I remember my husband telling me he was going to watch TV and then I remember him telling me he just finished watching True Lies, but there was no time between those two announcements. Led Zepplin is playing right now. My eyes are closed as I'm typing this. I have this problem with my daugter because she is concerned that the boy she considers her best friend at school doesn't like her anymore. I don't really know what to tell her to make her feel better, because, you know, boys are stupid. Of course, this one is only six, but she's not really getting that thing with boys where they don't want to play with girls because it's not cool or whatever. Anyway, she's confused because she really does think of him as her best friend and she's not really interested in just playing with someone else. I give her suggestions, but in...OK, gotta go, work calls.

      Yes I am back again,  guest blogger on my sister's site.  I leave she wanted to see how long it would take for me to notice her little counter strike on my blog.  I must say it would have been much more effective if she hadn't TOLD me that she launched a counter strike on my blog then inducing me to go check mine out and notice her post.  On a different note.  I think I'm going to be recreating in the fine city of AUSTIN, TX tomorrow!  where the weather is supposed to be in the seventies!  thats right I'm going to be sitting at a cafe listening to live music.  sipping on a bit of shiner bock beer, and eating a bit of tex mex gold!  while my sister will still be freezing her boogers off in Indiana.  But  alas, I will bow my head and poor a bit of my beer out for my homey that passed.

      Today I'll be interviewing my friend Elena. She's a university spainish and italian instructor and wants to get some stuff off her mind.   KC: What about work has been pissing you off lately?  EL: I have two things that are kind of related but the big things are when people twist info to make themselves look good and when people do not take ownership of past mistakes, comments, etc.  KC: OK, give us the dirt on HOW people are twisiting  information to make themselves sound good.  EL: Blind copying (rather obviously by the kind of info included in the message) higher ups on emails with messages like "by the way, did you take care of this urgent thing that we discussed" - which had never been mentioned.  KC: What about academia today motivates this kind of behavior?  EL: This behavior is not unique to academia, but is born of insecurity or envy.  If one were to focus on problems unique to academia, one could cite the fact that academia in some ways is struggling to recreate an identity in a world where business models are the only reference for how things should be done.  ie, if I want to make changes to the curriculum or pay structure, the number of commitees/people who have to "approve" the change makes it slower than government and often so far from the original proposal that it fails its original goal.  There are exceptions to this, of course.  I work with two extremely very capable faculty members who are focused on goals, sensitive to the "stakeholders" and effective in their follow-up.  It's taken a while to be recognized for this excellence, though.  KC: How, in particular, are these two faculty members excellent?  EL: They solicit meaningful feedback from all involved or affected by a desicion and they focus on the message/intent/experience of those giving the feedback, rather than selectively choosing or "interpreting" the info that may be beneficial to them in moving forth their own agenda (which inevitably results in greater problems down the line).  KC: Is there really an "agenda" for those who create the problems other than their own perceived advancement?   EL: Sure, sometimes they want to ingratiate themselves to others, avoid making waves, avoid extra resposibility on their part, or simply to be contrary.  I suppose there is a perceived personal benefit, but it's different from an agenda.   KC: I suppose what I'm asking is are these butt-suckers really interested in improving the academic environment? Do they even understand how their behavior stifles intellectual betterment?  EL: Ah, I see.  I think some truly don't have an understanding of the "big picture"  with regard to intellectual betterment.  They may have neither the expertise, experience nor capability.

      Just a little update on the last interview shown below—Kelly has gotten an agent who is very excited about her manuscript. So keep your eyes out for the book, which I am sure will be in stores realatively soon. You know, once they find a publisher and then go through the entire editing process and design the cover and do all the press on it and take Kelly's picture for the jacket. After all that stuff, expect to see it on bookstore shelves in the very near future.

      Why do I post more on my brother's blog than he does? Why am I forced to sit here doing nothing, feeling my unused brain matter seep slowly from my ears? Why do American Girl dolls cost soooooooooo much freaking money? Isn't it disgusting to exploit a young girl's budding self-awareness for a buck? And why do I give into the capitalist machine? Why does my daughter now have three of those dolls? I could buy a really nice new diningroom light fixture for that money. Why am I not famous by now? Why don't I have my own talkshow by now? What ever happened to C.C. + Music Factory? Why do old men think it's appropriate to call grown women girls? What happened to the Pulitzer I said I was going to win by the time I was 30 in my high school yearbook? Why are people in Utah the only ones who know what NCMO stands for?

      I just had a really interesting interview here with Kelly, who is one of the grad students who works with me in the office and I lost it. It's floating around cyberspace out there. I hate computers sometimes, I really do. I started interviewing Kelly to help diffuse some of the tension she's feeling because of a lot of interest she's generating from literary agents. So, we'll just start again.  KC: How do you feel knowing that we've just lost all that material?  KK: Well, it's made me nervous again about agents. A little disappointing, but I'll live through it. Although I'm glad we lost that comment about me grinding up on agents' legs.  KC: Don't you know nothing's ever really lost.  KK: It's floating around on the internet.  KC: Yeah, and right here again, too.  KK: Dammit. Thwarted again. I'm never going to be at a point where I can take responsibility for the things I say, just like Jonathan Franzen.   KC: Funny you should mention him since we talked about Oprah in the lost interview. So, will you turn Oprah down?  KK: Hell no. I think the literary world now, it complains that people don't read good things, but when they do, they complain because they want to be set apart. They're just a bunch of  snobs. Hell, no. If Oprah wants me, I'll grind on her leg too. I think Oprah should run for president. I think she's the only black person and the only female who could run right now and possibly win. Because I think there would be a whole new turnout of people who'd vote. Like housewives who don't vote. Oprah and Arnold. What duo.  KC: It could happen. You never know. So, what's the title of your book so people can run out and buy once it hits the shelves?  KK: Born-Again.  KC: Tell us a little about it.  KK: Stock reply: It's a story of an intelligent 13 year-old-girl who is very religious. She's been raised pentecostal revivalist born-again christian. She is assigned to read "The Origin of Species" for an academic camp that awards her a scholarship. She forges the permission slip that lists required readings, convincing herself that it is not a sin to read it as long as she doesn't believe it.  KC: What are the primary themes you're tackling in your book?  KK: The sort of vacuum that evangelical doctrine creates for itself. The perpetuation of ignorance and fear that somehow justifies religion. Fundamentalist religions.  KC: What do you hope readers take away from the book once they've read it?  KK: I think people, I mean the born-agains, people really fear and demonize these people and although I feel they're destroying other cultures, I want people to understand why they do this and how they cultivate their members, and that they're not really bad people. Some are very good people who have been through bad experiences and want to share love. But you have mass herders like Pat Robertson who makes them afraid of death and chaos. The fact, that in Darwin's world, they're insignificant on an individual level, but serve a higher purpose in evolution.  KC: Now, you mentioned wanting to make it as a novelist first so that you have the freedom to write your poetry. Do you ever envision writing poetry exclusively?  KK: No. I think since poetry is really dying in this country. I want to be able to use all sides of my writings. Short stories, I have a book of short stories. I have a book of poetry that's ready to go out. Stories I find I can't write in poetry, I can write in short stories and vice versa. I think they all compliment each other.  KC: What do you attribute this death of poetry to?  KK: Definitely laziness. I think the entire culture. People just want to sit back and not put any effort into anything. They just want to come home, sit back and be entertained. I think there are two components to story, spectacle and narrative. And more and more, I think people only focus on the spectacle. It's all equivalent to pornography.  KC: So do you think there's any hope for the literary arts in America? What needs to happen?  KK: Not under George Bush's idea of education. My mother's friend teaches 8th grade English and this new program has her handing out worksheets where they just do abstract reasoning instead of learning abstract reasoning through reading books. Everything is becoming standardized. We insist on the uniqueness of people, but everything we do is standardized.  KC: Do you think any of this has come about because of complaints of results on standardized tests and whatnot, where minority groups complain they don't have the same educational foundation to succeed, and that this is an attempt to provide that?  KK: I mean standardized testing doesn't make up for socio-economic differences. I went to Bowdoin and I had never even written a paper in high school. I don't think it changes that wealthy people get better education because they can buy it. I think these programs are for people who just want to follow the rules and not think for themselves. I think we should encourage people to think for themselves. I think the most academically stagnant environment would be one were everyone only knows the same stuff and have never learned anything different.  KC: Having gone to two fairly affluent universities, would you prefer now to have attended more widely accessible schools (like state university?  KK: It's yes and no. In smaller institutions, you get more attention. The entire english department at Bowdoin knew me and encouraged me and because these schools accept so many rich students, they have the resources for better education. But I've never known so  many silver spoon children. They're not there because they want to learn. They treat it like a social retreat. It's hard to make a real decision on a question to like that. But people who haven't been taught to value education in the first place, they tend to be in those larger universities.  So it's definitely a problem and I think always having that balance, the affirmative action, letting kids into colleges that can't contribute to the wealth of the college, but can contribute to the academic are important.   KC: Well, it's just about time to call it a day. Thanks for talking to us. It's been really interesting.

      Today I've got a special treat. I'm interviewing my brother's girlfriend Christina. She's a really sweet girl, and I think my brother's a lucky guy since she's willing to be seen with him in public. At any rate, let's get started.  KC: Tell us a little about yourself, Christina.  CB: my name is christina [last name], i'm 25. i'm originally from cleveland, ohio, but moved to dc about 2 years ago.  KC: And which do you prefer, Cleveland or DC?  CB: definitely dc - cleveland is a nice famliy city, but that's not where i am in my life right now  KC: OK, I'm going to cut right to the chase: What do you really think about my brother?  CB: interesting question :-) there are a ton of things i think about your brother. let me try and get into that more - i'll ramble for a bit if you want  KC: That's fine. Rambling is good. Talk as long as you want. It all makes for fascinating reading.  :-)  CB: mike is just mike - there's no other way to describe him. there's no one else in the world who is like him. he makes everyone around him happy, including me. he's always trying to make sure people are ok, that they aren't being left out, or that he's taking care of them in some way. he's always giving all he can to his family and friends. i think that's one of the things that i love about him. he's also one of the most random people i have ever met, although he says i should call it eccentric :-) he's says things as they come to his mind, sort of like he doesn't have a filter in there. but that's another thing that makes him special becuase you always know that he'll tell you what he's thinking and not hold back. he's honest and always means what he says. he won't try to sugar coat something to make it how you want to hear it.  KC: Well, you're right, there is no filter. His brain is completely filterless. I'm curious to know, when you first met him, did you know he was half-Asian?  CB: he brings  a smile to my face everything i think about him. i see him in all these different moments at once. like seeing him on a friday night and how his face lights up as he walks in the door. or when he's concnetrating on something, like when we cook together, he's all serious and focused. or when he's just out hanging with everyone and relaxed. some of his best faces though are defintely in pictures and those are ones i remeber best - he's always doing something goofy. i love the way he looks at me. i can always tell how much he loves me by the way he looks at me. it's like his eyes are some kind of laser beam that send me all this love :-)  i could tell he was. it was his eyes. i love mike, every bit about him, even the little things that drive me crazy.   KC: That's so sweet, and I'm not usually one to say something like that. I'm actually getting a little choked up reading your answer. Since he's my brother, it's hard for me to see him as others do. So, you two are getting married, right?   CB: i hope so someday, when he asks. we've talked about it a lot. and with him, there is no doubt in my mind that he will, it's just a matter of when. he needed to get back to dc though and get settled, and do some of that stuff. i'm not rushed for it. when it happens it will.   KC: Yeah, I keep pestering him about it. I'm one that really likes to know EVERYTHING. See, I basically think you two are already engaged because he says he's planning on marrying you and you say you're planning on marrying him--that's being engaged, you know. Now I do want to ask you how the two of you have discussed religion, because it's obviously an important part of his life. As far as I can see, it's probably going to be the biggest issue between the two of you. Do you think the two of you will be able to come to a compromise?  CB: that's a good point. there is no doubt in my mind that i want to be with him and i know he feels the same. being engaged though takes everything to a new level. there are still certain things that mike and i don't discuss because we are not engaged or married. like money - i have no idea what he makes, has, debts, etc and he doesn't know that about me. the other we always go back and forth about it church. i'm not catholic and he is, and he's really set in being catholic and i'm set in being protestant. i know it's not a big deal now, but that's something that we would really have to talk seriously about.  KC: Yeah. The religion thing is a big one.  CB: every time we've talked about it, it's gets heated. mike can be stubborn and i will fully admit to being stubborn. we both were raised in the church and have very devout families. religion has always been a big part of my life growing up and him as well. i don't know what we would end up doing to be honest. we would have to reach some level of compromise and make the best of it. for me anyways, it wouldn't be any kind of deal buster with him. i figure it could always be worse, we're both christian.  KC: I want to get back to an earlier comment you made about liking what drives you crazy about Mike. What are those things that drive you crazy?  CB: oh michael and his little eccentricities ;-) sometimes he can drive me crazy, not bad crazy, but just - ahhh! he loves the weekends because he's here in va and we are doing our thing together. and when that happens, he just lets go and he's all over the place :-) i don't know how to describe it very well, but it's like you can't get him to focus on any one thing! but it's funny at the same time. other things he does that drive me crazy, nothing much really - just little things when you are living with someone (we aren't technically, but basically) - like he shuts the door when he leaves my room and i hate having the door shut when i come back to it (i'm always afraid someone is on the other side, silly, i know). stuff like that.   KC: I know exactly what you're talking about when it comes to his scattered activity. I want to ask you a couple of questions about work now, please talk a little bit about what you do.  CB: ok. i work for deloitte and touche and i've been here for almost three years. my official title is senior consulant. i started working at deloitte as an intern in cleveland and then worked there after graduation. i wasn't liking the work up there and asked to transfer to dc becuase i wanted to do a more specific kind of work that was available in dc. they said yes, and sent me down here 2 years ago. in a nutshell, i perform data analytics and statistical analysis on our client's data (client's being who we audit as a firm). it's interesteing work. sometimes it can be frustrating because it's like solving problems and puzzles all day. but i do get to work with our client's driectly and i do like have the person to person interaction.   KC: So did you actually do well in statistics in college? I really, really sucked at it.  CB: yeah, i found out in college that i actually like stats and things of that nature. i got a degree in management information sytems and decision sciences (business statistics).  KC: Yeah, whenever I think of stat, I think of that one Far Side cartoon that says, "Hell's Library," and it's shelves and shelves of books on word problems, which to me is half of what's confusing about stat. I seemed to never be able to translate the written problems and scenarios into mathematic equations that made sense. Do you know what I mean?  CB: i know exactly what you mean :-) that's half of what we do on a day to day basis. try and make sense of these abstract things. it can really make you want to pull your hair out.  KC: Besides the statistics, what other courses did you enjoy in college?  CB: art history was my favorite. i would have been an art history major in a heartbeat, but i knew that i would not be able to get a good job with benefits after graduation. i'm sure someday i'll pursue that more, but as a hobby. it's just not a practical job. 	i did like my music and all that during college. i didn't really stop playing until after i graduated.	i just never found time in my life again. i would like to be able to do that again as well.  KC: I don't know about your music. Were you in a band?  CB: i've played violin for my whole life. my mom started me on it when i was 4, and i played all through college. i actually was even a music education major for a year or so, but realized that as much as i love music, i couldn't do that all day long.music was alwyas a huge part of my life growing up. my parnets had my brother and i were really involved in it. lessons every week, music theory lessons, group lessons, orchestra, piano lessons, chamber music, all of it.  KC: So had you originally hoped to be part of a symphany one day or were you thinking you might teach music?  CB: when i went to college, i actually thoguht i wanted to be a pediatrician. but i didn't like that. so i went to music education because i knew i would never be really good enough to be in a major orchestra, but i didn't like that either. it became a job instead of something fun. hours in a practice room is not my idea of fun. that's how i ended up in busines, kind of an, well, if all else fails, this is something i could try too.  KC: Going back to the art history, what kind of art do you like best?  CB: it changes on what i see i think. sometimes i like impressionism, but i really like post-impressionism a lot. some of  the more modern art i like as well. i like going to a museum and just wandering around.  KC: You could volunteer to be a docent at one of the Smithsonian museums.  CB: yeah, i've thought of that. i think that would be really cool to do someday. right now, i just don't have enough time. i volunteer for the junior league and they have a program to be a part of the corchran gallery in dc,	but it's a three year committement and classes, etc.  KC: Yeah, lack of time is the eternal problem in life. Speaking of time and life, what are some of the things you absolutely want to do before you die?  CB: wow - there are so many things that i would love to do. some of my dreams are to travel all around the world and see everything i can, all the usual ones people say - african safari or hike to machu picchu. but i also want to try and live in some of those places. but other than traveling, i think i would really have to think about it. dying seems pretty far away right now. i try and do everything i can now and take advantage of opportunities - i figure that way i'll always be working towards doing everything i can before i die. and when i get some time to think about it, hopefully i'll already have done most of the things i wanted to, does that make sense?  KC: Sure. Now tell me what is your biggest pet peeve?  CB: nail filing. i can't stand to hear people filing their nails. it's like hearing nails on a chalkboard. i don't know what some of my other pet peeves are. nothing too big i guess	if i can't seem to remember them.  KC: Which characteristic in people do you find most annoying?  CB: when people always try to one up you, like i say i had a bad day, and the other person says, i had a bad day and proceeds to tell you why it was so much worse than yours. that's annoying.	i can't think of any others right now, but i'm sure i could come up with some - it would just have to be right when someone was doing something that annoyed me.  KC: When have you been most hurt by a person?  CB: this one isn't something that someone did to me purposefully. but, i was hurt by my family in a way. my dad had a heart attack when i was gone one summer and my mom and brother were there, but i wasn't. and then my dad also had another near-death incident that my mom and brother were there for. i've always felt like i missed big family events, like i missed out. i wasn't there for the expereince and can never fully appreciate what they went through - the trauma, the paramedics, the life flights, rushing to the hospital. it was like a huge family event and i missed it. i can picture it all in my head how it probably happened, but it's not real. now i always have this fear of missing something. like i'm not going to be there when i should be. so it's not that they hurt me on purpose or anything, but that's something that's always hurt. but more that i felt hurt because i wasn't there for them, kind of guilty. i don't know if that makes sense.  KC: No, I understand what you mean. When my mother was diagnosed with her brain tumor and had her subsequent operation, I was away at college and wasn't even told she was going to have surgery until a week before hand. I was the only one not home while they were going through the ordeal of her testing and hospitilizations and whatnot. So you only end up understanding it in a peripheral way because you didn't eat, breathe and sleep it 24 hours a day like everyone else. But, what really hurt about that particular situation was that they didn't keep me informed. Everyone else knew about all of this and no one bothered to tell me. That was difficult to deal with. Unfortunately, I see that it is getting close to quitting time for me, so I will bring this to an end. I want to thank you for sharing your time with us today, and I hope you'll join us again one day.

      Hi, today I am very excited about the guest here with me. I don't know him personally, but he works with my friend Michelle, (who, as you'll recall, is interviewed a couple of posts down) and is also a graphic artist. His name is Dennis. So, let's get cracking and jump right into it.  KC: Dennis, for our viewing audience, could you please provide a little background on your ethnicity?  DS: I was born in Seoul, Korea in 1969. My 2nd Generation Irish and 1/8 Polish father (born in a small farm outside of Litchfield, KY), was drafted by the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War at the age of 21. Luckily for him, he was stationed in Korea. My father met my mother, at the age of 27, and in one of those boom-boom clubs the soldiers would go to after hours. They got some boom-boom on them and started dating.  Six months later, they decided to get married and ran into a host of trouble because of restrictions the military sets on dating between foreign nationals and U.S. Soldiers during war time. They somehow got through all the red tape, and married overseas. I came along, and by my second birthday, we moved to Ft. Bragg South Carolina and finally moved to Kentucky by my 6th birthday.   I've been living around red-necks ever since. I guess that makes me: 1/2 Korean, 1/4 Irish, 1/8 Polish and 1/8 Redneck.  KC: I have to say that the similarities between our backgrounds are uncanny. I was also born in 1969; although, only conceived in Seoul, Korea. I actually popped out in Fort Gordon, GA. My father (who is half Irish and half Czechoslovakian) was stationed in Korea and met my mother through mutual friends. They also decided to get married after just a couple of months, but because my mother was converting to Catholicism to marry my father, they didn't have a church wedding until a few months after their "official wedding" at the embassy. Apparently, the two of them went to get their paperwork and they called my father into the office while my mother waited in the hall. My father says the guy behind the desk signed a piece of paper, handed it to him and said, "Congratulations, you're married." Have you ever heard a more romantic story? Yeah, gotta love the US government. Now, how would you describe your experiences growing up half-Korean in America?  DS: It's really comforting (and a bit disturbing) to know that other people have had similar experiences in the past.  Growing up half-Korean... well, it wasn't a pleasurable experience early on: I went to public schools; was very shy throughout grade school, was 1 of only 3 Asian kids in a fairly redneck high school going through some segregation wars; was short for my age until late high school; and my last name was Smiley (for those of you who grew up in the 80's, you know why that name was a popular [ha] name).  Anyway, because of this combination, I really recessed into my studies and sports. I don't know if I was really that introverted, I just felt more comfortable alone ? and more in-charge (throughout my grade school years).  Interestingly enough, my sister had a lot of the same experiences but it had an opposite effect on her. She became super-extroverted and became a wild child. I look back now and wish she did not hang around the "wrong" kinds of kids, just because they accepted her for who she was. At 28, she is still making up for many of her mistakes during the middle/high school years.  This is what I think happened to me: I became overly sensitive to other people's feelings, but became de-sensitized to being different. In fact, when I was in the Army (2 years active, 4 years reserves), my fellow soldier's called me "mother" because I always took care of everyone and watched out for them (when someone was in trouble, I would always be called). Because I started to care less for my insecurities, I started to excel in anything that posed itself as a challenge. That is what I would focus on and that is the way I am even to this day. It's why I am in the creative field, I'm sure (It's always different and there are many challenges).  P.S. ? I often make super non-politically correct statements (some Asian statement even offend white people), because I really believe all cultures have some area of hilarity ? and it is ridiculous to think any one culture should have to be tippy-toed around, as to not "offend" anyone. So, if I have offended anyone, get over it. Don't take yourself so seriously ? it builds character.  KC: Well, I wasn't really introverted. My father stayed in the Army until I was a sophomore in college, so we (I have a younger sister and younger brother) moved a lot. When I was in the primary grades (K-3), we lived in Augusta, Ga. because my father was stationed at Ft. Gordon and I remember getting a lot of shit from a good  number of people in Georgia. To this day, it's really, really hard for me hear a southern accent and not immediately have negative feelings. I'm obviously able to get over it because it's a stupid reaction, but it's an instinctive thing now. At any rate, I can remember being mad because I'd get called names and they wouldn't even be right. This one girl would call me Chinese girl or Japanese girl, and my mom said I'd come home from school and yell that people were stupid because they didn't know I was Korean. But since we moved around a lot, I never felt the compulsion to really try and fit in because I knew we were going to be gone in a couple of years. As far as being politically uncorrect, go for it. I think people are way to concerned about how PC they are and it has a stifling effect because people are too scared to say anything. In general, I think everybody needs to chill out and not take any of it too seriously.  I find the statement about your sister interesting because I've read some articles where a lot of Asian-American men feel they're getting the short end of the stick because mainstream American culture seems more accepting of images of Asian women and embraces them more readily, and that the men still have to struggle to be considered attractive and "viable" potential partners. What do you think about that?  DS: Not touting my own horn, but I've never really been in a position of feeling that unattractive (I'm high yellow you know). However, because of the insecurities that I felt for feeling different, I think it did cause me to become an over-achiever at a pretty young age. In fact, I choose to challenge and put myself in situations of extreme discomfort at times, just to get the feeling of accomplishment achieving my goal.  I don't look to put others down or am so competitive that I lose sight of why I do things, I just think that I always have to prove to myself that I am as good as anyone else or sometimes even better. The weird thing is, when I accomplish something, it becomes less of a challenge the second time. So, I usually look toward the next challenge.  An example is: Last year my wife and I thought about building a house. We found a lot in a nice neighborhood and started to talk to builders. After talking to several General Contractors, I started noticing that none were that detail-oriented. I was a little uneasy with not knowing where we were on a budget until toward the completion of a house, so I started to gather information and references on top-notch contractors in the area which we were going to live. After 5 months of planning (in the midst of contractors and friends objections because of the pitfalls and my lack of experience in the field of construction), I had a hole dug and started to contract out our house.   We are moving in this weekend, as a mater of fact. I look back now at all of  the trials and worries I went through (I kept my wife out of most of it, until the painting stage), and realized that I thoroughly enjoyed the process of learning and embarking on an unknown challenge. I guess all I needed was a few people to say "...you're not going to be able to do this..."   Anyway, I feel rising above all of my insecurities and living through all of the ridicule in childhood helped me develop as an achiever and a person that truly enjoys watching and helping others succeed.  KC: It's refreshing to hear that despite having been teased as a child, you didn't use your race as an excuse to not keep trying in life. I've had a similar perspective in my life. I never thought or felt that being half-Asian limited me in any way, despite the fact that there were people who were never going to let me forget that I didn't look like them. But, I think that's the way that it should be. I feel absolutely no sympathy for "minorities" who whine that they haven't been able to accomplish what they want because someone is keeping them down. It's all a lot of self-pitying crap, as far as I'm concerned. Now, I'm going to veer off from the race questions a bit and ask what do you think is the primary source of conflict between men and women?  DS: I think it's sex.  Not simply a physical activity thing, it can be that as well, but I don't believe it is a subject. It believe that we are "wired" a little different at birth.  I'm a very creative person, so I'm very open-minded, but when I'm asked a question that is (to me) that ambiguous, I usually fall back to scientific studies and develop theories from a mix of written information and my own observations.  I think that because of instinct, as an incredibly adaptable species our opposites (sometimes the same sex – though I believe one partner takes on the opposite role) are sought after for balance (for survival).  Anyway, men are more technical-task oriented and women are more cognitive–abstract thinkers. Obviously, there are exceptions to this theory, but I think that in many cases, the origin of most conflicts between men and women is the simple fact of how we are "programmed" at birth.  Example:  A woman sits on a sofa in her living room tackling a crossword puzzle. Her spouse comes into the room and sits on the sofa next to her he sits deeply with his head back and eyes closed.  A few minutes pass by and she says, "Honey, what's on your mind?"  Her spouse glances sideways at her and says, "Nothin'."  The woman says in a puzzled voice, "You have to have something on your mind."  The spouse replies (and folks, he really means it), "No, I've got nothing on my mind... just resting".  KC: Hmmm, interesting. So let me ask you, do men consider sex a "technical task" and that it's not wrapped up in something more than just the physical and mechanical process of engaging in intercourse?  DS: That's kind of a hard question to answer quickly. I think a lot of men have some complexity in their thinking when it comes to the subject of sex, but I would also add that in my opinion (whether most educated men would admit to this or not) most men would put on their list of importance first — the "technical task". Sex (the full scope of the meaning something more), would come in second.   The best way to describe it, for me, is that if we use it in the context of the solar system (the full definition of sex being the solar system), most men would say the whole solar system is the physical activity of engaging in intercourse instead of saying the sun is the physical activity and is just part of a bigger picture.  I really believe, that at the center of the pursuit for the opposite sex, men (just like males in any animal species) initially pursue sex for the physical contact/act itself — not for anything greater. Relationships that happen to develop from this contact is most times tertiary.  But, I do not want to rationalize. I think the question depends on the masculinity, the femininity, the background, and the culture of the man in question. Personally speaking, I think the definition is greater — or maybe I have just convinced myself that it is. To be absolutely, totally honest, when I read your question, images of attractive women engaging in the physical act itself (okay there was one ugly one) immediately streamed through my mind.  KC: OK, so tell me truthfully, do men consider having to deal with the emotional side of a relationship just the trade-off for having access to regular sex? And why did you imagine one ugly woman? Was it to keep the fantasy more realistic?  DS: I think that men consciously or unconsciously, at first, think of the emotional side as a trade off (or maybe as an obstacle). At that point, they might realize something more in a relationship (a longing or maybe a connection with the person) or sensing more, they might start developing a way to get out of the situation with as little complications as possible.  The men that say they have always looked for a relationship and something more before sex crosses their minds, are either not telling the whole truth, or have been so ingrained with that idea in their upbringing that they  honestly think they believe what they are saying.  The ugly woman keeps it more realistic, but (beauty is only skin deep) she might bring more to the table than the more attractive ones might not. Also, maybe subconsciously it's comfortable to have someone to fall back to that doesn't make me conscious of my insecurities.  KC: I find this fascinating....So, why do men marry? What do they get out of marriage?  DS: Men marry because there is some sort of connection above and beyond the initial sexual attraction. This can come at any time in a relationship (after the initial attraction) and, in my observations, can be attributed to several things: The woman can have physical or behavioral characteristics of the man's mother (or his mother figure in childhood) and he just feels "at home" with her; The woman may fit all the criteria for the man's image of the "perfect" woman and he may not want to "share her" with anyone else; he may have a low self-esteem (or may be unattractive) and upon a long search for someone to have relations with, falls "in love" with the first person he sleeps with (feeling that this only comes along once in a life-time); and finally he may find a person in which there is much in common and he just feels "right" with — wanting to sustain that feeling forever.  KC: So do men really "love" women, or are they just fulfilling some other territorial compulsion left over from when we still lived in caves? Even in the case of men who marry the first girl they have sex with, the instinctual drive could be to form a "tribe" because, historically speaking, it's easier to survive within a group than on one's own.  DS: I believe love has a different meaning to any given man. We definitely are brought into the world with that instinctual "tribe" mentality, so I would say that many men fit the criteria of the caveman. However with the power and the complications of the human brain, I think there are many men, as well, that believe that they truly "love".  For example, I truly love my wife. But is it love in the conscious sense of what most of us believe – defined? Or is it a combination of what I've been taught from childhood with a subconscious underlying instinctual drive? I don't really know the correct answer, but I lean more toward the latter.  KC: What do you think love is for women, then?  DS: I don’t think that love is only for women. But referencing the the original question of the source of conflicts, I think men and women's idea of what love is, (besides a connection to someone) is different. Sex (the physical act) shares a larger part in the man's idea of love.  KC: What's been the hardest thing you and your wife have had to overcome in your relationship?  DS: The hardest thing we've had to overcome has been the loss of my father two years ago from a massive heart attack at the age of 50, and 6 months later the loss of my wife's father from a freak car accident. It really was taxing on the relationship.  KC: In what way? Taxing to the point that it could have meant the break-up in your marriage, or taxing in that you both needed a level of support that the other wasn't prepared to offer given your individual griefs?  DS: It's a bit complicated. I'm the oldest son (I have only a younger sister), so when my father died it was a shock to the family. Because my mother is Korean and her support group was members of her Korean church, I became the main facilitator and support person for my mother. With all the things that needed to put to rest (setting social security, funeral arrangements, investments), I really did not have time to grieve.  By the time things were pretty much in order, my wife's father is in a car accident and we have to travel to Illinois to attend the funeral and take care of family stuff there (my wife is the oldest sister of four). My wife and her father never really had a great relationship. Her father left her mom when she was 4 years old, and my wife has kind of held that against him. However, about a year before his passing, I convinced my wife to put the past behind her and try to strike up a relationship with her father and his new life. She gave in and forgave him as well and something in herself. I am so happy she did that before the accident.  Anyway, after my father-in-law's funeral, we take it upon ourselves to be the support group for my wife's mother and family. By the time both of our families lives are moving toward a balance, we are both grieving our losses. This puts both of us in a dark, depression stage. We tried to be so supportive of each other, but there was distance, emotionally and of course, physically. After about a year of this, and many talks of the subject, we started on a course of finding out what good came of the deaths. The more we looked, the more we discovered silver linings in our families and our lives.  I look back now and so much good has come out of the two deaths. We care more about people rather than life as a big picture. Corny as it sounds, we started to actually "stop and smell the roses." I honestly don't think I would have jumped into contracting our new home (with no knowledge of building) if the deaths did not happen. We also have a longing appreciation of each and every friend, family and child that we know. It's sounds cliché, I know, but it has changed our lives to the point that we came back to the crossroads in life and have taken the path that we at one time did not choose.  KC: Yeah, it's amazing the sorts of challenges life throws at you. My husband and I had a really rough period after our daughter was born. We had just moved to Indiana two months earlier so I could attend graduate school, and we didn't have any family around to fall on, and trying to get on track with new jobs and school and baby was really, really hard. I have a tendency to turn inward and just focus on getting done what needs to be done and not worrying about what's going on beyond that. Needless to say, it put a lot of strain on our marriage and we were both miserable and angry at each other for a really healthy chunk of time. At any rate, we kind of forced ourselves to talk about the situation and try to examine what was going on and what the causes of it were, and over time we were able to get rid of a lot of the harmful emotions and habits. Any marriage is a compromise and looking back on it, you definitely feel pride in knowing you tackled it together and were able to come through the fire intact. So what do you think it is about so many marriages today that make people not willing to do the hard work required of staying together?  DS: Methinks that has several answers. Some people do not have the aptitude for the level of empathy and compassion to make a marriage last. Some are too lazy to make the effort to work at the relationship. Some have too much pride to admit when they are wrong or to let their spouse win some, lose some.   Finally, some come from backgrounds where there hasn't been a role model (or models) to give them the tools for making a marriage and family work. That is why kids of divorced parents statistically have higher divorce rates (when reaching the appropriate age to marry), than children of happily married couples.  KC: Well, it's no secret that over the past few decades the divorce rate in America has sky-rocketed. Do you think couples split more easily today because there's no longer the social stigma attached to divorce that there once was, or do you think there's been a fundamental break-down in the perceived sanctity of marriage in our country, or do you think it's something altogether different?  DS: I think both of those apply. People are getting so used to hearing about divorce, it's almost like saying "were buying a house". It's commonplace to hear younger couples talk about their second marriage. Also, there is a breakdown in the sanctity of marriage. I talk to young people all the time about marriage and to them it is a "thing" you do. If it doesn't work out, there is a way "out".  It's not just a marriage thing, I think the less-than-thirty generation (sounds familiar) is bombarded with contradictions in issues of morality that we and our parents hold true. Bill Clinton, for example, not only has given everyone the public impression that he cheats on his wife, but ask any teen if a blowjob is sex and a high group will tell you "no".  KC: So what needs to happen? What do we, as a society, need to do to make young people realize marriage is a lifelong process that takes a lot of hard work and commitment, and isn't one of those "crazy" little things you do like piercing your belly-button?  DS: I don't really know if it is a fix we can do in our generation but we could lay the groundwork for it on a big picture scale: media, government (local) messaging, in school maybe. The school thing is so tricky. You cannot have religion-related stuff taught, but moral issues are for everyone.  I think it is a slow fix because from my own experience and observation, many of my close friends and family have children that have skewed ideas of morality. But many of them have strong moral convictions and are outstanding parents.  KC: You know, this might sound weird or prejudiced in some way, but my whole life I've thought most pure Americans--people whose parents are both American--are a little lazier and unmotivated than people who have at least one parent from another country. Obviously, this doesn't apply to everyone, but I think when someone has that kind of intimate outside exposure to something else, they tend to have a greater appreciation for the value of working for what you want and not expecting everything to just be handed to you. I think that plays into the morality thing because understanding you are accountable for your own actions and decisions goes hand-in-hand with morality. What are your thoughts on that?  DS: I absolutely believe that is true. I've seen it first hand with my family members that own businesses (Asian) and with the Mexicans (not Latin-Americans) working on my house. The amount of work that a person outputs is what they think is expected of themselves. But, the person that is accustomed to hard work, long-hours or less-than-perfect conditions has higher expectations of themselves. It's what they think of as normal.  That goes for a persons actions and decisions as well. However, it seems that each generation from the first in this country keeps their culture and teachings, but replace bits and pieces with the "American" way of thinking. I'm guessing about the fourth or fifth generation will show only small amounts of the original culture.  KC: Do you have full Korean relatives living in the states? Cousins and such?  DS: Yes. Almost all of my mother's family, except a brother, live in the states. More than half here in Kentucky.  KC: And are you and your sister the only mixed children in the family?  DS: Yes. And yes there is a perceptible distiction from the full relatives (in their actions and conversations).  KC: Do you and your sister speak Korean?  DS: We both speak very broken Korean.  KC: My brother, sister and I don't speak any Korean except for a few phrases and I've found I feel a real grieving for not being able to speak the language because I can't interact with some of my relatives. How do your Korean relatives treat you? Do they view you as Korean or American?  DS: They definitely treat us as Americans. I also would like to speak to my grandmother, who only speaks korean.  KC: How does that make you feel? My American cousins view us as Korean and our Korean cousins view us as American, so we're an "other" to everybody.  DS: It makes me want to excel and try harder at everything so that the family recognizes me for something they deem as respectful.  KC: Have you had friction in your relationship with your mother because she thinks your behavior is too American? That's definitely been an issue with my mom as I've grown up.  DS: No. I think that is more between women and their daughters. Mine was always looking good for the other family members because of my being the oldest son. My sister had much friction.  KC: Do your Korean aunts and uncles expect their kids to marry other Koreans?  DS: Absolutely. As a matter of fact, my mother was hurt and wouldn't talk to my wife (now) when we were dating, and even went out of her way to hurt my wife's feelings. All because she's white.  KC: But even your mom was upset? That's odd since she married a white man. My mother never worried about whether or not we ended up marrying white people, but I really think she was hoping my brother might marry  a korean girl. His girlfriend is white, so that's probably not going to happen. How did your wife handle this treatment?  DS: At first my wife was hurt. After about a year of dating, she tried to avoid her as much as possible and felt uncomfortable around her when my mom came to visit. But, after the two deaths, they've become much closer. They aren't your typical "go out and shop" together mother and daughter-in-law, but we do take mom out to eat and spend more time with her.  KC: What do YOU think about your mother's reluctance to accept a non-Korean daughter-in-law?

      As promised, I have Kristen back with me again today to finish up our conversation from yesterday.  KC: OK, I've got to know more about this whole Jodee Knight thing. How did you two end up being friends? She seemed so mainstream to me.  KW: You know, I'm not really sure how we became friends.  We were in debate class and she sat in front of me with some other popular girl (can't think of who)...anyways, you know me, I was very opinionated about issues, most of which the class hadn't even thought about much or even more  scary, knew anything (Apartheid, what is that?)....First of all I think she was just intrigued because I  had lived near Wash. D.C. and she had gone there the previous summer and so we talked a lot about the area.  I think it was her first big trip out of Utah and it obviously impressed her a lot.  I was sarcastic and not afraid to say what I thought and I think she thought that was so "quirky" and that it  would be a huge step for her to associate with someone outside her little clique...we just continued to chat and hang out together at debate tournaments so I guess circumstance really cemented our friendship more than genuinely trying to hang out with each other.  She had a WAY more busy social life than I did, but in Senior year she did include me in a lot of stuff.  We skipped class and went to a Howard Jones concert with two other girls and stayed in a hotel in park city (that was a riot and a really long story because those girls did not know how to really cut loose).  She knew I didn't like most of her other friends though, and they felt the same about me so for the most part we just kinda tolerated each other.  She and Angie did not like each other at all, for obvious reasons, they were complete opposites!  For a brief period, she really struggled with her identity.  She told me a lot about how she wanted a lot of things but knew that her upbringing and her Mormon values acted as a barrier to her really embracing life. Honestly, she wanted to go to D.C. and work and live the single girl's life for a while and she talked to me openly about how she questioned things in the Mormon church and about life in general in Utah. I swear, I know its hard to believe, but its true! She didn't like always being the misshomecomingqueen personality that she couldn't avoid being...she even made me take her dancing to some 18 and under club that briefly opened in ogden and started hanging out with some of those  guys in drama who were goths and openly acted gay (I don't know if they really knew what they were)!    I don't know it was weird, in the long run, she really couldn't break free of her values and just accepted a life as a good mormon, going on her mission and marrying that guy.  I remember her parents were so cruel to her because they wanted her married after her freshman year of college and she hadn't done it yet, that is why the whole mission thing came up.  I have to say I'm grateful to her because through her I in some small way saw a little different side of the people I judged to be jocks and snotty girls.  Like John Taylor, from your class, he came back to a game right before his mission and we were hanging out and I was being me, coming up with some game to invent poetry (one person would make up a line, the next continue) and he apparently was totally impressed with that and thought I was cool and told people that he wished he wasn't going on his mission so he could ask me out. . .and Sean Casey (I think that was his name) had the best taste in music, I was shocked!!!  Sara somebody ended up being a little more knowledgeable about the world than I thought (plus she told me she had a nose job, that was priceless)...  Phew, that is a lot of info.  But my memory bank has been triggered and its downloading fast and furious.  KC: OK, number one, I'm SCREAMING (not in a bad way) to hear John Taylor wanted to ask you out because he is the first guy to have ever seen my bare boob during a make-out session. Whew, just reading his name brought back a whole bunch of stuff. At any rate, I know Jodee and Angie hated each other, but I always thought that had more to do with the fact that Angie was good friends with Ron Eastland and Jodee didn't like that. Anywho, what's the coolest thing you've ever dug up in the field?  KW: Whoa baby, John Taylor got a special surprise (and obviously a penchant for non-Mormon girls!).  Yeah, you are right, I think a lot of Angie and Jodee's antagonism had to do with Ron and Angie's friendship but me being friends with both didn't help! To be honest, I didn't even remember Ang and Ron were friends but that is because I didn't see them interact a lot together (they both worked at Gap right? Or did you and Ron work at Gap?  Damn memories)....  Coolest thing I dug up?  Very easy:  A carved Ipiutak (Ancient Eskimo) antler endpiece for a staff and an ivory decorative item (perhaps part of breastplate) with Jet Black eyes...I'll attach pictures but don't post them anywhere since the village is concerned about their publication.  They are only around 1200 years old, but they were so beautiful and I dug them up while trying to carefully excavate a displaced burial with a group of elderly Eskimo women and young children watching me.  When I uncovered the antler item, I think my heart almost stopped and the gasps from everyone were astounding.  It was the first time I became really emotionally involved with my work, I didn't realize it but tears were running down my face and when I finally stood up, all the little old ladies came over and patted my arms and blessed me with little statements because they were grateful for the way I had handled it.  That whole project was the best experience of my life, I learned so much about myself and grew besides doing amazing archaeology.  Longer answer then you expected, eh? I'm trying to avoid finishing this bibliography, I HATE doing them.  KC: See, I think that would be really exciting to hold something like that. I mean, really, you're holding history in your hands. When you think about the past, it seems like something totally disconnected from everyday reality, but to hold something tangible and realize what permanence and longevity really mean is like having the breath knocked out of you a little. As far as John Taylor's surprise, believe me, it was a small one. :-) Yeah, Angie and Ron worked together at the Gap and I didn't even realize how close they were until after he died and Angie called me about it because I don't think she knew who else she could cry to. They showed his picture during a slide-show at our 10th reunion and, of course, everyone got really quiet. I didn't really know him at all. I also remembered another piece of gossip that's pretty good. Did you know that Matt Godfrey is the mayor of Ogden? I guess that's not really gossip, but interesting, nonetheless.  Now back to the questioning. Which teacher did you hate most in high school and why?  KW:(History) Yes, you summed it up pretty well.  I was hooked the first time I was digging a site (a Spanish Colonial house destroyed in the Pueblo Indian Revolt of 1680 in Santa Fe) and realized I was the first person to see what I had uncovered since it had been left behind on a day that must have been frightening and horrific (the residents of the house probably got away thanks to sympathetic Pueblo Indians in area).   (Little surprise) Ha!   (Ron's death) I feel bad when that happened, I think it was when we were freshman in college.  At that point I think Angie and I had had a bit of a falling out due to the fact that she owed me money and we were running with different crowds, I feel bad that she didn't really have anyone there to help her with it.  I was kinda absorbed in dealing with Jodee, she really clung to me because I was the only one that wasn't saying all the stock sympathetic statements to her.  She really expected Ron to come back and that they would settle down, I don't know if it would have happened but of course at the moment of tragedy she couldn't let go of that notion.  I didn't get to go to my 10 year reunion, no one told me, I don't think Angie went either?  Our class officers weren't real good about advertising it to people.   (Gossip) Yeah my brother told me!  I think it is kinda funny.  I seem to remember something tragic happening to him, like he had a girlfriend in CA who was murdered or something...   (Most-hated teacher) Mr. Moore.  I couldn't stand that man even though I know everyone that he was the most spectacular English teacher. First of all, he wasn't, he just impressed everyone with all his exotic recollections of his European trips. Second of all, he was creepy, he latched onto some girls in my class and it made me very uncomfortable how much time he spent with them and how he would sit there and actually do things like give them candy in front of the whole class...it just wasn't appropriate.  He also couldn't stand me because the first day of class he ran his slide show of art from museums in Europe where he impresses everyone with how much he knows about art history and I answered every one of his questions...he literally was flustered by the fact that someone was responding!  I think he pretty much didn't like me after that.  Remember how he used to throw things around at people when expounding on points, well one time he looked like he was going to throw one of his hefty gold rings at me and I looked him straight in the eye and said "Don't you dare throw that at me or I will walk out of here".  I did well in his class (and subsequently scored a "5" on the AP English exam so he couldn't have been all bad as a teacher but I credit my teachers in VA more).   KC: And once again, it's time to end our interview for the day. I want to thank you again for taking time out of your day to chat with us today. Hope to talk to you again soon.

      Today I've got another really special guest with me in the studio. Her name is Kristen and she's an archaeologist in Texas with the U.S. Army. Kristen and I went to high school together in Utah. Being non-Mormon in Utah is enough to make people friends in high school there, but we were also reporters on  the school newspaper together, and that's probably how we really got to know each other. Kristen also was a very good friend of my sister's, who was in the same year as Kristen. I'm a year older than the two of them, so I was really more of a mature, fiercely intelligent woman role model for Kristen. :-) At any rate, let's get started with the interview.  KC: Kristen, when we were in high school, you were really committed to the idea of becoming a journalist. You wanted to go to Columbia and really go all the way with it. I'm curious to know how you shifted gears and ended up in archaeology.  KW: good question! When I went to college, I started out a communication major with every intention of becoming an international journalist. I diligently signed up for my first required courses in communications (a core requirement of courses had to be filled before you could be "accepted" into the journalism program or something like that).  The first course had some vague innocuous title like "Intro. to Mass Communications."  On the first day of class our instructor had us go around the room and explain why we were in communications as a major.  To my dismay I was surrounded with a bunch of eager freshman wanting to become (and these are quotes), a "PR representative making 80k a year" and, my personal favorite, "the next Jane Pauley"....now that in and of itself was not enough to drive me away from the field...after all I was an idealist, hopeful that I could save the world through obective reporting of world events.  However, with every assignment, I became more dejected about the field.  One of our projects was to develop a "spin" for the Exxon Oil Company in addressing the Valdez Oil Spill.  In hindsight, I can see that there was a reason to prepare an assignment, this was a general communication class not a journalism class.  I was offended and simply wrote a paper saying that I would encourage Exxon to admit their error and take proactive steps to mitigate the damage, working in conjunction with the environmental groups who were the most vocal about the spill to clean-up the spill.  I received a C for not thinking creatively in how to spin the issue.  The PR wannabe-Young Republican who wore a tie to class everyday received an A for finding a way to blame it all on the Captain and not directly acknowledge fault.  I hated the class and stopped giving it my all immediately...there were mountains to hike and hours to be spent hanging out talking about important issues.    At the same time that I was dragging myself reluctantly to that class, I was thinking back on a class I had taken the quarter before.  The class was called "The Human Past" and it intrigued me.  I had never been too much into science in high school but in this class, genetics and the role of physical sciences in uncovering the mystery of human evolution and adaptation fascinated me.  The class was writing intensive and after the first exam, the professor had berated a mortified room of students about the poor quality of writing and how disappointed he was that only 3 students had managed to write coherently and earn an A.  Well, you can guess who one of those students was!  Nothing like a little positive reinforcement.    I still hadn't given up my journalistic goals, but I had become more interested in pursuing international politics as a degree rather than communications which I felt wasn't going to give me what I wanted (in my idealistic mind).  I can't really pinpoint when I decided to officially pursue becoming an archaeologist, I just know that the classes in cultural anthropology I took to supplement my international politics class were far more interesting and stimulating to me.  I loved exploring the mystery of how culture defines us as human beings and the role it has played in world geopolitics.  After my first archaeology class, I became even more hooked on the idea of literally digging stuff up to piece together history.  I loved being outdoors and out in remote places, I found it hard and still find it hard to spend long periods in big cities and stuck in offices.  I thought archaeology was the perfect way for me to stimulate my mind and my body at the same time...and now, over a decade later, here I am!     I could go on and on about it, people are confused. You should have seen my parents when I said I was switching majors, I consoled my Dad with the idea that because of the intensive writing involved in Anthropology, many people used it as a springboard for law school.  In all reality, I did toy with that idea as I wanted to pursue Environmental and Native American Rights law, but couldn't give up dig-in-the dirt archaeology.  Also, as an irony, the girl who was editor-in-chief of paper before me, Sherri Murry, also became an archaeologist. She got her masters like me and works in SLC as a professional archaeologist.  Isn't that funny?  KC: Actually, I don't think it's such a far stretch that you (or Sherri) ended up in archaeology because it's still a form of story-telling, and not in the sense of fictional story-telling, but in the journalistic sense. What do you do? You piece together bits of evidence you've collected to come up with a bigger picture and cohesive story of what happened. Like you, I became disillusioned with the journalistic field when I was in college because it seemed so obvious the push was more on how you had to write a story to increase submissions and viewers. I did consider just switching to PR because I thought, hey, that's really all it is. I'd rather just be truthful and call it what it is. In the end, I finished out with journalism, but you can see it's not where I stayed. I got sick of writing what other people wanted me to write and not being able to tell what I saw as the truth, so I focus on my fiction now because I can tell the stories I want to tell. Now, with all of that out of my system...what comes to your mind when you hear "Utah?"  KW: Love your comments about your own experience with Journalism.  I don't think PR is so bad now either, after all, at least it is explicit, whereas I wonder with the media...whether swinging a blatant liberal or conservative agenda it bothers me that there is very little objectivity.  First thing that comes to mind when I hear "utah"?  Well the first thing I do is physically cringe (I swear! I did it just now)...the second thing I think of is "STERILE" and "STIFLING"...it is a place that just scares the s#$t out of me because I think it tends to just drain the individuality out of people in the long run.  My brother still lives there with a wife who comes from a mormon family.  She doesn't practice the religion but she carries the values and behavior at some intrinsic level despite her attempt at liberal posturing...and my brother, my family feels like he isn't the same person, he has started talking like a Utahan,  you know that sing-song kind of nervous voice...and they are just so sorta uptight and afraid of anything different.  In fact, this year was the very first time their whole family traveled out of state to come see my parents and us in Santa Fe.   My brother thinks Utah is so great, but I just can't stand it, the minute I get there I start feeling repressed.  Does that make sense? I went there for some training with a co-worker and he didn't believe all the stuff I said about it but after a day or two, he changed his tune to "I can't believe you are right, this place just FEELS oppressive."  And now with all the growth, it has all the negatives of big cities with none of the positives despite all their attempts to internationalize (is that a word) the place for the olympics.  There is a woman I work with here who is a civil engineer and she grew up an airforce brat in Layton.  She is Catholic and the first time we both realized we were from Utah and NOT mormon we both launched into this laundry list of common things we hated about the place.  She never wants to go back there to live, even though her parents retired there and she does visit them with her husband and child.   There is just something that Utah does to you, there was an article on MSNBC.Com during the Olympics from a reporter who grew up there as a Non-Mormon and it really articulated the experience well. I wish I had bookmarked it!  Have you read that Jon Krakeur book on the polygamists in Utah? It really is a well-written history about Utah in general that really captures the overall feeling of being in Utah and not running with the Righteous so to speak!  KC: Actually, I haven't read the book you mention,  but last I time I was in Utah visiting my friend Erin, I actually got to see a polygamist family up close and personal. We were hiking at Zion and we were at the visitor's center and there they were in all their glory. I was really excited because I'd never seen a polygamist when I lived there. Oddly enough, they reminded me of the Amish. They kind of dressed that way. The really funny thing (maybe not so funny, really) is that the husband was just gross looking. I mean, there was nothing about him that would make you look at him twice, let alone let him touch you, and there he was with his multiple wives?banging away every night, I'm sure. I'm sure they didn't appreciate me staring at them like they were an exhibit in a zoo. When I first started college, people couldn't believe the things I told them about living there. I do try to get back every few years to visit friends, because they're still my friends despite it all, and I can't help but lovin' them. Now, who is the guy in your past that you think "what if" about?  KW: Yeah I saw polygamists when I worked in a government public affairs office in college there, they would come in for forms and stuff...kinda funny how they are anti-government until they need welfare and stuff like that because the man is too lazy and busy procreating to earn a living to support all these women and children...very strange..people do have a hard time understanding what it is like. When I used to spend my summers up north of the Arctic Circle, my colleagues looked forward to the after dinner relaxation in the kitchen tent and would pester me for stories of Utah and Mormons..funny, huh?  What guy do I think "What If"?  Easiest question ever, I've always wondered about a guy in high school in Virginia, Christopher Getty.  When I started school there after moving from Austin, TX, I felt in major culture shock. My family had moved us from the richest school district in Austin (where we were the "poor" family) to the middle of rural Virginia farm country where we were suddenly, the "Richest."  I had never been out of the suburbs except on vacation and was shocked by the demographics of the high school population.  They were equally shocked by me with my odd clothing (MTV had been a staple in Austin).  Christopher was this preppy guy who had moved there the year before from Texas and he was immediately friendly to me and started talking about Texas and our shared love of good music.  He was popular, a swim team member, fine looking and he was always a good friend to me.  I'm sure his prepster friends gave him a hard time about me (oooh, it sounds so "Pretty in Pink" now!), but he never shied away from being a friend to me when they were around or anything like that.  Of course, he never asked me out on a date or anything but when I moved to Utah, I remember being shocked that he had actually written me back after I sent him a letter (he actually sent me a tape that he talked on and put some tunes on, I thought it was cool).  I don't know what happened to him, I'm sure he is either settled down and happily married with 1.5 kids or maybe even gay (with my luck)! But I always thought we would have ended up a really cool odd couple!!  There is also Preston Trent Staats from my junior high days in Texas. We were going steady until I dramatically broke up with him for daring to want to hold my hand in school!! Too much physical contact for me in my opinion! I thought he was even geekier and more boring than me.  He tried to win me back with a Garfield calendar at Christmas....I wasn't impressed.  I later found out from my best friend there (who I still talk to also!) that he ended up becoming an Olympic level swimmer (actually tried out for Olympic team, may have been on it) and was really good looking and had got a PHD in computer science and owned his own software company in Austin and ran triathlons...sigh...don't know where he is now, maybe Austin but also might be getting an MBA at Harvard last I heard (ironically I don't know if he is married, but I can't imagine he isn't!  What about you? Who is your "what if?"  Is it someone from Weber?  hint hint, anyone I know ;^)  Sorry my answers are so long! I can't shut up when it comes to dredging up memories!  KC: My "what if" is a fellow Weberite; although, I don't know if you knew him. I dated him the summer before I started college, my friend Erin's brother Steve. It was a very whirlwind sort of romance and the only one in my life where I felt completely swept off my feet. Of course, there were too many barriers for it to really work. There was the religion issue, just to begin with, and the fact that he was in Utah and I was in Pennsylvania. But, I still like to wonder about it because it's really the only relationship I've had where it came to an end because of logistics rather than due to the fact that we were done with each other. There's nothing more intriguing than a relationship that didn't have the chance to run itself out. At any rate, he made me feel like the most beautiful girl in the world at a point in life when every girl should get to feel that way. So, I owe him a lot for that. Also, don't apologize for the long answers?you're an interviewer's dream. No prodding needed here. :-) OK, I'm going to liberate you now. What thing from your past have you been hiding because you'd be absolutely mortified if anyone knew?  KW:I remember you dating someone but I can't remember the guy!  Oh well, I'm surprised I remember as much as I do, but it always seems to be odd stuff, like the place I used to eat lunch at Weber with Angie, some stairwell near our lockers and I'd hog all Ang's lunch because it was usually some awesome leftovers of your mom's Korean cooking (the fact that there is not one but several Korean restaurants around me since it is an army town balances the negatives of being in Central Texas! Although I still can't find some of the things your Mom made (some spicy pancake and a kinda stew like thing with rolled up ricecakes sticks in it...mmmm)  Anyways, I digress, as usual.....avoiding the issue obviously.  What thing are you hiding from your past that you would be absolutely mortified if anyone knew???? I suppose it would have to be an affair I had with a fellow graduate student whilst I was coming to the end of a turbulent romance with my ex-fianc?e...although we had officially decided to become unengaged we were still a couple working on things supposedly (although it was mostly me trying to deal with this very intelligent, tortured writer guy trying to get into graduate school for philosophy).  The fellow student was someone who WAS just engaged to a girl he had dated for 7 years and who I knew and liked.  They were also having relationship problems, but that really is not justification for what happened.  It was an easy way to escape problems by running to someone else.  It stopped obviously although I have to admit by that point I was starting to like him a lot since my relationship was failing so miserably.  He married the girl but they ended up divorcing a year later (weird huh, almost 10 years together and then marriage made them implode).  He rushed out and married the next girl he dated and they have a kid.  We email as friends but we've never really talked about what happened. I feel most awful about my ex-fianc?e, for all his faults, he was always faithful to me and made me feel beautiful.  He just was so devoted to reading, wandering the wilderness on solitary journeys and writing that there wasn't a lot of room for me.  I really wanted us to work but even though we tried after our "Disengagement", it didn't really work. I think the main problem is that I could never really come clean and tell him what happened and he deserved to know that...but I was afraid it would devastate him and felt ashamed.  So I've kept it to myself, only two other people really know it happened.  My ex-fianc?e and I stay in touch, he has moved toFrance to pursue his writing dream, but I still can't bring myself to tell him.  Shameful isn't it? I hope you edit this down! I used to feel really awful about this, while I'm still not thrilled with it, after observing and talking with people over the years, I realize I'm not the only one who has made some hurtful choices in my life.  KC:Wow! I don't have anything that good. All my secrets revolve around stuff I haven't told my parents. So, I'm going to come clean with you. Dad, that time Laura Glenn got drunk and I told you I didn't, well, I did. I feel really bad about that one because when my father looked me straight in the eye and asked if I was telling the truth, I looked him straight back in the eye and said, "When have I ever lied to you before?" And he took my word for it. Also, I took birth control pills in college and had sex before I got married. OK, that felt good. Now, in what way do you think we (Americans) as a culture have failed our children?  KW: Man, you are so good! I debated about just going with the run of the mill, I lied to my parents, but I never really did. I always told them about when I drank and my parents pretty much accepted me living with my ex-fianc?e and knew I was sexually active, they just wanted to make sure I was safe and covered my bases...my Mom took me to the doctor so I could get my birth control pills!!!  My Dad just kinda pretended he didn't know it was all going on! It was safer for him that way!  In what ways have we as Americans as a culture failed our children?  I have to say that there are probably many ways we have failed: in not protecting our environment more, in not protecting our country more, in not giving greater recognition to the past and in emphasizing the "Me" in American....I hope I can write my ideas out here because there are a lot of things that bother me.  It bothers me that kids today are exposed to so much hedonistic and greedy behavior via the "role models" put out there by the media. Whether it be Britney Spears or Kobe Bryant (I know innocent until proven guilty but still his behavior was wrong) or 50 Cent the rapper, we feed our kids a culture that it is o.k. to be a superficial person.  If people say to me that Britney Spears is about female empowerment, I laugh, she doesn't even know how to spell the word much less explain what it means (and I'm not saying girls should stomp around in combat boots and not shave their legs, just that I don't think Britney gets balancing femininity with equality). Kids today get bombarded with the notion that the easiest way to be a success is to sing well like on American Idol or play sports or just be attractive.  The show Survivor summarizes to me the problems I see in American Culture.  As an anthropologist, the notion of Tribe means a group of folks with shared values and behavior who stay together as a result of their common experience.  On the show survivor, the goal is to outsmart and outwit your teammates to win a big wad of money.  That doesn't make any sense, a "tribe" would never behave in that way.  In most primitive societies, groups of people banded together find communal sharing a better way to deal with exterior pressures.    I feel sad, I think we grew up in a generation that was more socially and politically conscious than youth today.  The technology that was supposed to improve education for future generations in some ways is contributing to its demise...videogames, sound bytes, etc.....in some ways we have shortened the attention span of an entire generation!  Awareness and study of the past, of theatre, of art, of literature are all important aspects of a modern society.  I don't think the Technological and Scientific advances we've seen would have taken place without them...it is like that Sting commercial for music and math, have you seen it?  I guess that sounds really depressing and it probably shouldn't.  First of all, I don't have kids so I guess I don't have a great perspective although I do outreach and programs at a lot of schools and am sometimes horrified by what I see.  On the other hand, I do think there is a lot of hope for the future based on my positive experiences from schools and also from witnessing my own niece and nephews.  There is plenty of good out there, I just hope that this fascination with the gluttonous media blob of reality tv and greed is balanced out some.      Phew, this soapbox is making me dizzy!!! If that doesn't make any sense, I wouldn't be surprised, I was putting down my thoughts quickly.  Edit down or condense into something legible, if you can!  This was great fun!  KC: Is that your polite way of telling me you've got more important things to do right now? :-)  KW: no! I'm still finishing up lunch! It just sounded like it might be the last question! Gal, I could write all day about stuff and since I'm stuck in front of a computer anyway with this mapping I'm doing, what the hell? :^)  KC: OK, since you're still willing to answer questions. What's the best piece of gossip you've heard about someone we went to high school with?  KW: What is the best piece of gossip from high school?  Geez, I don't know, I remember hearing that one of my best friends, Jodee Knight, got married and divorced later which was kinda shocking to me....I also found out that a guy (Danny Wade) I was in World History with ended up being gay and living with a flight attendant partner in SLC(and he was not a drama guy, he hung with the popular-sporto crowd)....Seems like I should having something more "juicy"...I mean Angie is a little bit of a story but she is my friend so I don't count that!  I think I was gossip for a little while because when I was at home after my freshman year, I hung out with Brian White and we both had become, um very briefly, deadhead potheads...I'm sure some of the old crew talked about that but we were in college so it was ok to be smokin' (and I did smoke cigarettes for a long time and lived with someone out of wedlock, gasp, the shame!)... I feel like there is someone big I'm missing but can't think of it....whatchya got?  Anything good?  KC: No, I don't have anything really, really good. Although, I did hear that before Jennifer Cragun got married she went in for a gyn check-up and the doctor felt a large tumor on one of her ovaries, so they scheduled for immediate surgery because they thought it might be cancer and when they opened her up, the tumor was an egg that had tried to develop without being fertilized and it had teeth and bone in it. Of course, when told this, I found it hard to believe and said, "Are you sure it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy and they're just trying to cover up the fact that she had sex before marriage?" I still think that's the case. But that's probably the best thing I've heard. Did you even know who Jennifer Cragun was? You were friends with Jodee Knight? I have to say that really shocks me. There was nothing about her that would make me think you could be friends with her. I definitely want to hear more on this, but, alas, I have to go pick-up [my daughter] from school. Maybe we can start this up again tomorrow if you have time. At any rate, thanks so much for talking to me today. It's been real, just like J-Lo.

      I have a very special treat for all of you today. I've got my friend Ann here with us. I cannot put into words the kind of friend she is to me. You know how people talk about finding their soul mates? Well, I think there are soul siblings, too, and I think of Ann as a soul sister. Some people just get you in a way that the majority of the population can't, and those are the people you never shake. Ann and I met our freshman year of college, where we lived next to each other in the dorm. To say things were a little "wild" that year would be a massive, massive understatement. Let's just say it was a year filled with the kind of experiences that end up binding people to each other for life. We were roommates our sophomore year. We were little sisters in TWO fraternities together, and she was one of my bridesmaids.  So, without further adieu, let's get started:  KC: What do  you regret most in life, and what do you regret least?  AK: I would have to say that what I regret most is not enjoying my senior year of college as much as I should have.  For some crazy reason, I was eager to get out into the job market - what was I thinking?? What I regret least is moving to San Francisco.  I have had some opportunites come my way here that I would never have had if I had stayed in NJ and plus it's a kick ass place to live.  KC: When you think back to some of the crazy stuff we did in college, what makes you laugh the hardest?  AK: Wow - there are soooo many.  First thing that comes to mind is back in the Stone Hall days - you and I devising a fool proof plan to steal alcohol without anyone finding out....singing the Mission Impossible theme while doing it.  (of course, everyone knew it was us).  KC: Yeah, I always laugh when I think about that and anytime I hear the Mission Impossible theme song. I think I remember most fondly the time you and I had to pee so bad on the way to an after-hours party that we stopped and peed in the bushes in front of some fraternity. I think it was DU. The sad part is we weren't even in college anymore on that one. Old habits die hard, I guess. Describe the best day of your life.  AK: The peeing in the yard WAS a great one too!!  Friends that are peeing together...anyway Best Day of My Life - wow that is REALLY tough!!  I have great moments but best day..hmmm. Probably while in South Africa on safari.  During the day, [my boyfriend] and I took the micro bus out in the park by ourselves and just saw some amazing things - a full grown elephant not more than 200 feet from us, two giraffe fighting, two hippos fighting, about 10 different species of birds within 100 yards of us.  That same night we went out on a night ride and drove alongside two male lions.  I could have reached out and touched them.  It was an experience that I will never forget.  KC: Did I know you went to South Africa? I think I remember it somewhere in the back of my mind. I always wanted to go on a photo safari until I read about all the parasites and whatnot you can get in Africa. Now, I don't know. I know I'm a wimp, but what can I say? How would you summarize the shortcomings of American culture today?  AK: I think the biggest shortcoming has to do with our education system.  One example (and this of course, is only my take on it), most Europeans are taught and become fluent in at least one other language.  In America, maybe some kids learn Spanish. Another short coming is the lack of interest in traveling to others parts of the world and experiencing different cultures.  Many of my friends have NO desire to travel outside of the US (and this is before 9-11).  Most won't even leave the East Coast, if you can believe it.  There is so much out there to see, it's sad that they are missing out.  KC: I agree on both counts. People seem to take education for granted in this country because it's so easily accessible, and have forgotten you have to actually put something (resources) into it to get something out of it. When you see people who have been denied education, like girls in Afghanistan, and then see how eager they are for it, you realize how complacent so many Americans have become. I also don't understand people who don't want to travel. Because my entire childhood was spent travelling, I get fidgety and nervous after I've been in one place a couple of years, and feel like I want to go someplace new and see something new. In your globe-trotting, what would you say has been your most enlightening and insightful experience into another culture?  AK: Again, my answer goes back to South Africa.  We stayed in Capetown for a week where we were attending a wedding of a white South African woman.  I was amazed at how fearful and hateful the white people are of the black people.  At the wedding reception, a woman at one of the tables wouldn't talk to or even look at the black waiter/busboy serving her food and wine.  Only her husband would address him. God forbid anyone said "thank you".  Of course, in my bitchness, I made an effort to say thank you to everyone that helped me in a slightly louder tone than I would normally use. :)  KC: That is interesting. I'd actually like to hear more about your observations, but I think I'll save that for a private conversation. So, what's the freakiest thing you've ever done while having sex?  AK: I think I'm pretty tame in this area but I would have to say slapping the rear of my partner.  KC: While you were shouting, "Who's your Momma? Who's your Momma?" No? Did you have him outfitted in horse gear? OK, tell me about the last fist-fight you were in and what caused it. Also, who won?  AK: Can you believe I've NEVER been in an actual fist fight?  I did have a girl come up to me in high school telling me that she was going to "beat the shit of me" for talking to someone's boyfriend or something like that.  I started to laugh in her face (nervous reaction I'm sure) and I think I said "Why doesn't she (the girlfriend beat me up?  Why do you have to do it?".   But it got her all flustered and she didn't know what to do. So, she said that I better stay away from him or else. Strange - so I guess I won?  KC: Actually, I can't believe you've never been in an actual fist fight. I don't think that's really registering with me. There are certain truths I've taken for granted: The Earth is round, beer is good, and Ann has kicked the shit out of someone at least once in her life. At any rate, it's nearly punch-out time for me, so I'll have to bring this interview to an end. But before I do, I want to thank you for sharing your time with our viewing audience and we hope to see you again real soon. Peace out, G.

      Today my friend Michelle is on board to talk to us. Michelle and I used to work together at the American Nurses Association. I was the reporter for their newspaper and Michelle was the graphic designer. While there are many people I'd like to forget from my time at ANA, (well actually not many, just one really, really annoying person) Michelle is not one of them. She's just a super swell gal and cute as a button, to boot. Michelle also is currently expecting twins, which is incredibly exciting. So let's start with some "being in the family way" questions:  KC: How's the pregnancy going and do you know the sexes yet?  MK: The pregnancy is going very well so far considering the load I'm carrying around. I'm always a little scared to say things are "great" because that would be the day that I'd go into preterm labor—and these little bugs need to bake for at least two more months. We're not finding out the sexes...I know that just kills you doesn't it?!  KC: So you're not finding out the sexes, huh? Yeah, and you're right, that kills me. I don't understand why people make such a big deal about being "surprised." But enough of the rant, we are interviewing you. So, what would you say has been the most unexpected part of being pregnant?  MK: Well, after trying for so long, just being pregnant was pretty unexpected. Feeling them move around in there is pretty cool, but I can't say I wasn't expecting that. I guess I'd say watching your stomach stretch beyond your imagination has been the hardest thing to grasp. I mean you see it on other people but it's different when it's your body doing it.  KC: Do you have stretch marks yet?  MK: No, luckily not yet. My friend gave me some "belly balm" to rub on twice a day but I hear those products won't really stop it if you're genetically inclined to get them. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because neither my mom or my sister got them.  KC: Yeah, well you're lucky if you don't get them. I thought I was going to get away scott-free until my sixth month and then I look down and in one night, they were everywhere. Sad, really. What's been the most annoying thing people have done to you, related to the pregnancy?  MK: Well, I don't mind the belly touching because somehow I feel like the babies are truly a buffer between me and the offending hands. Plus I grew up in an Italian family...very emotional and touchy/feely...so I guess I've gotten used to people invading my personal space. It does kinda get annoying with people asking how you're feeling all the time...I know they are just being nice and mean well, and if it were just coming from one or two people no big deal, but I hear it all day long from everyone in the office. I just want to hang a sign around my neck that says "I feel fine. Thanks for asking."  KC: I was most annoyed by how men on the Metro would avert their eyes when they saw me come onboard so they wouldn't feel obligated to offer me their seat. How is [your husband] handling the pregnancy? Is he completely freaked out?  MK: Oh, the metro...thank God I don't have to ride that thing anymore. If he is he's not showing it. He was the one who really wanted twins in thefirst place so he's pretty happy about how everything is turning out. I think his timeline and my timeline are a little different as far as when things need to get done around the house. His attitude is more "What's the rush, we have at least two more months." and I'm thinking..."If they put me on bed rest and all your tools are still strung out around the house I might explode!"  He keeps asking to take photos of my stomach. I think he finds it humorous and fascinating at the same time.  KC: It is such an exciting time when you're pregnant, although, very trying as well. I'm going to shift gears a bit now: What have you learned about [your husband] since being married that makes it impossible to still think of him the way you did before you got married. (Feel free to be brutally honest with this one.)  MK: Wow, that's kinda tough. I was finding out all sorts of things before we got married...like how incredibly stubborn he is. And he's an absolute SLOB! He's gotten somewhat better with that after six years of nagging but I'm afraid it will take the next 26 before I truly break him down.  The first thing that popped in my head is how much he is like his father. Some of the facial expressions and hand gestures he's picked up since we're living closer to them and see them more often freaks me out a little. I mean you don't want to crawl into bed with your husband one night and wake up with your father-in-law. Whoa, that just gives me the heeby-geebies.  KC: Yeah, waking up with [your husband's] father would freak me out too. What's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you?  MK: I'm sure I've embarrassed myself on numerous occasions without knowing it but the one that sticks out in my head is when I went to my friend Tim's fathers visitation and walked into the wrong room at the funeral home and into someone else's wake. After standing in line, signing the register and standing in line again to view the body it wasn't until I was five or so feet away before I realized it was some little old lady I didn't know. I was wondering why I hadn't seen Tim or the rest of his family and then I had to try and subtly get out of the line before I had to say something to this woman's family. I just went to the closest chair and acted like I was pulling myself together then I slipped out. I got a thank you note from that family a few weeks later.  KC: So you just sat in the chair and pretended to cry a little or did you act real hysterical and scream, "Oh, why her, God? Why her?" And then run out like to couldn't stand to be the room with her lifeless carcass? Yeah, I can see why that would be embarrassing. Now, let's get down and dirty: What is the most erotic dream/fantasy you've ever had?   MK: See, I knew it was only a matter of time.  It's a little cliché but it would probably be the handsome stranger fantasy where you are only drawn to each other my meaningless physical attraction and it's the best sex of your life. My guy is kinda Lenny Kravitz-esque (is that spelled right?) and usually on a beach with no shirt, longer, loose shorts and looking extremely hot.  KC: What do you mean it was only a matter of time? Are you suggesting that I have a gutter-mind? Lenny Kravitz, hmmm? Me like. OK, since we're heading down the slippery slope of proper discussion topics at a fast pace, let me ask you if you find yourself farting more often now that you're pregnant?  MK: Hey, I thought we were off the pregnant thing. But yes, I'd have to say so. Although not as much as I thought I would be based on what you hear and I've seen on "Sex In the City." Maybe I just farted more than most to begin with.  KC: I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. Heh, heh, heh. In your opinion, during the period of detente between the United States and former USSR, what would you say was the key contributing factor to the eventual breakdown of that uneasy peace?  MK: I couldn't say for sure...maybe it was our stereotype of their women all being fat and hairy. But more than likely it had something to do with a Republican, probably Reagan. And don't give me the crap about Nixon getting things going in the first place he was probably just scared after the whole Bay of Pigs thing. But hey, it made for some interesting music in high school...what was that Phil Collins song with the puppets in the video? Oh and I know you know the Sting song "Do the Russians love their children too" what was the exact title of that one? Are we going to keep going with politics? I mean cracking on Bush becomes such a bore and I know you have a lot of Republican friends out there I wouldn't want to insult. ;-)  KC: Hey, now. Republicans are people, too. At least we believe in taking care of ourselves instead of expecting handouts from the government. But, I digress. :-) I'm going to my happy place, I'm going to my happy place....When you think back to high school, what is the stupidest thing you can remember doing?  MK: Um...unfortunately it was probably all the unprotected sex. Not with different guys mind you but with my one boyfriend over a three year span. Pretty stupid. Hopefully my daughter (or son) will feel comfortable enough coming to me so that we can discuss birth control should she/he need it.  KC: Oh yeah, tell me about it. I'm trying now to set the foundation for a good talking relationship with [my daughter] so she feels she can come to me with anything as she gets older. But, regretfully, I notice that it just about time for me to call it a day. So, thanks for being with us today, Michelle. It's been a great conversation and I hope you'll see fit to join again one day.   MK: Sure, love to.  KC: Bye.

      OK folks, I've got my friend Lynn back again...for real this time. And since I've already given you all the background you need, we'll just start where we left off yesterday:  KC: Who would you say has been the most influential person in your life?  LS:that's a tough one...I would say my Dad... for various reasons...  KC: And what would those reasons be?  LS: Well, when I was a child, he was the more dominant personality of my parents... so I think I wanted to make him happy so I followed his life plan for myself... but as I got older, I saw the mistakes he was making - like living in the past and holding onto the bad things that happened in his life, and I decided to live the opposite of him...  KC: What were his life plans for you and what are the plans you now have for yourself?  LS: He wanted me to go to college - said you need a college education to do well... I found that wasn't true... now I'm trying to find happiness for myself... trying to figure out what would actually make me happy - careerwise, and then go for it.  KC: Well, he was a little bit right about the college part, you wouldn't have met me if you hadn't gone and think about how bleak your life would have been without me. :-)   LS: LOL! That's true! I don't regret going to college, I would have chosen different majors tho...  KC: What do you think you would have studied? And for the benefit of our listening audience, Lynn got her bachelors in speech disorders, right?  LS: LOL, that's right Kathy! I would have prefered to study something more creative such as interior design or even theater or broadcasting (like you)  KC: That's understandable, a lot of people want to be like me. But on a more serious note, how would you describe the quality of your last orgasm?  LS: Now that's an interesting question! coworker stopped by, hang out a sec...  KC: OK  LS: phones were just going crazy too... now what you wanted to know that quality of my last orgasm? No one has ever asked me that before... I'd say it was satisfying...  KC: Satisfying in the sense that it made you scream at the top of your lungs and claw the skin off the guy's back, or satisfying in the sense that at least you had one?  LS: Kind of in between the 2...  KC: So it was kind of a toe-curler, but nothing you're going to remember until you die? Is that about right?  LS: pretty much... I've never had one that I'd never forget...probably because I don't think I've been with that toe curling kind of person... one I'm truly in love with  KC: Well, I've never had the unforgettable orgasm either, even though I've found love. What do you think is the dumbest thing guys do in bed?  LS: LOL, do you have enough time for this answer?!  KC: Oh, believe me, I'll make the time. This is for posterity....  LS: Let's see, the most stupid thing they do is think that they are satisfying you because it feels good to them... that's the intercouse itself... other things would be not listening to what you tell them feels good...I had one guy get mad because I told him I don't have orgasms from actual intercourse and most women don't... he said every woman he was with had one... I said they faked it, and he got really pissed - why would they do that???!  KC: Yeah, men don't realize we're faking to kind of reward them for their effort. You know, like throwing a puppy a bone.  LS: or to get them to stop...sometime's I've had to do that too... I've had enough, so I pretend to be finished.  KC: That is a good point. Sometimes you just know nothing is going to happen and why put yourself through the ordeal of having some sweaty guy bouncing around on top of you.  LS: seriously! We should collaborate and write a book - I've always wanted to write a book about all my experiences because they are freaking funny!  KC: Well, why don't you share your funniest experience with us right now? I know I'd like to hear it.  LS: Well, I'm not even going to bring up [my college boyfriend]... that was one for the books!  KC: I do remember you telling me that he'd want to do it when you didn't so you'd just let him fuck your tits so he would leave you alone.  LS: LOL, I totally don't remember that story! That's funny! That's one good thing those DD's are good for!  KC: Yeah, and I remember I told you I'd never be able to pull that off because I can't  make cleavage no matter how hard together I try to push my boobs. Those little suckers are just too small.  LS: Here's a funny story, don't know how funny it'll come across in text, but I'll try...  KS: OK, we're all ears.  LS: A few years ago I went to a party back in PA... I ran into a guy who went to my high school and actually grew up around the block from me and was our paper boy, but I never really knew him... we talked for a while that evening and he asked me to go out to dinner with him sometime... I said sure... I wan't sure if I was attracted, but I thought I'd give him a chance...that evening he was dressed casual, shorts, baseball cap, t-shirt... I followed him to the main hwy that night from the party, and i'm on the phone with my friend Amy... he pulls over so I followed him... he gets out of his car and comes over to mine, so I told Amy to hang on a sec and I put the phone down... I open my window and ask what's up... he just lays one on me... and said, I just felt like kissing you... I thought that was weird... probably would have liked it if I was really attracted to him... so we part ways and I get back on the phone with Amy and tell her what happened...so he calls me the next day to set up a date for Friday... and we chatted awhile... then he calls me on Tues and asks what I'm doing, I had plans, but he was going to ask me if I wanted to come over and watch a video... I'm glad I had plans b/c I thought that was odd - kind of an intimate thing to do, especially since I really didn't know him that well, but we still planned on dinner on Friday...I had learned at the party from him that he was divorced for a couple of years, but he wasn't much of a conversationalist... so during the week, I pull out the old yearbook to check out his pic... he was OK... thick black hair, baby face... didn't do much in high school, I think it just had his address under his name... no clubs or sports... maybe baseball...so he comes by Friday to pick me up, I open the door and had the shock of my life - he wasn't wearing the cap - he was almost totally bald and what hair he had left was graying - I dont' know how I consealed my surprise... but I said, be right back, I need to get my purse... I went in the other room and said to myself - where did your hair go? it was like it disappeared during the week! so anyway, I overcame my shock and we went to dinner... they guy didn't speak 2 words... I had to do all the talking...so after I told him a bunch of funny stories about myself, I asked him a few things... I asked him if he had any children, he had a son... which I thought was odd he never brought up... then I said, why don't you tell me something funny about yourself... (so I could eat my food).   So while I'm eating, he's sitting there thinking for about 2 minutes, then said, "I guess I'm not funny".. I'm thinking - you got that right, brother... so I go in to the bathroom to call Amy and report this horrific date... before that he asks what I would like to do next... I asked him if he liked Jazz music... he said, "I just started listening to it" so I suggested going to a local jazz club... he says nothing... so when I come back from the bathroom he says, why don't we get a video... - what's with this guy and videos? I'm thinking he just wants to get me back to his place or mine... I didn't respond... so we leave the restaurant and are heading back to his huge pickup truck... we get to the back and instead of opening the door for me, he walks to the driver side and says, be careful getting in... I'm like "nice." So we get in and I have no idea where he's driving... finally he says, do you mind if we call it a night, I'm really tired from traveling. I was thankful, and said" Oh no, no problem"... so he drives me to my apt. and fortunately there was a huge console between us... I let him kiss my cheeck and thank him for dinner... he asks I he should walk me to the door and I said, "no, it's right there, I'm alright"... and I left... he called me a couple days later but I never called him back...that's one of my weird dating stories.  KC: Well, obviously, he was blinded by your beauty and at such a loss for what to do in the presence of such magnificence.  LS: That is so right, you are so observant! My latest interest is non-American men...  KC: I believe British and Irish men, to be exact. Isn't that right?  LS: Yes, and my new one is Russian... he lives in Sarasota.  KC: OK, tell me about the Commie.  LS: He's a customer of [blank] Motorcycles... bought 2 bikes from them... sold the first one then bought the second... his name is Victor (why wouldn't it be)... I've talked to him on the phone before, as a customer calling here...I met him this weekend at Daytona bike week and chatted with him, he's attractive.. dark skin, hair, lighter eyes, maybe green and that great accent...I came back Saturday and planned on staying over night... so he and I were chatting again and he was going to go back to Sarasota that night, but he stayed and we went out with my friend Michele and this guy Charlie - Charlie's another bike owner from NJ... a real hound dog...So we're at this bar that was packed and these 2 chicks that knew Victor come over to our little group... they were literally all over him, they really wanted to take him away from us... but he kept hanging around me... at one point I'm talking to him, up by his ear b/c it was so loud. Right in the middle of my sentence, he just kisses me... I'm thinking" well, alrighty then", when we stopped I said, "was I talking too much?" he said he just felt like kissing me"... so after witnessing this, the 2 chicks are still trying to get him...we went outside and ate a turkey leg, then we all left, minus the 2 hussies... went back to the hotel lobby and Michel went to bed, so I'm with the 2 guys... I go to the bathroom and some chick hits on me - never happened to me before... cracked me up... so to make a long story short I spend the night with Victor...  KC: Mmmmm, turkey leg....OK, what did I say? So you mean you had sex with Victor the commie?  LS: Yes, for a little bit...  KC: What do you mean for a little bit? He just stuck it in a little bit?  LS: I was half in the bag and ready for sleep - he doesn't drink, but was utterly exhausted from being in Daytona since Thursday, so we just hung it up and fell asleep...No, we fooled around for about 10 minutes... then tuckered out. I woke with a pounding headache... he drove me back to Orlando that morning...  KC: And how long ago was this?  LS: Saturday night into Sunday.  KC: So this was just over the weekend?  LS: Yes. I've met more guys down here in 4 months than I have back home over the last 4 years!  KC: Well I hate to break it to you, Wilkes-Barre ain't exactly the center of the universe, you know. Did Victor call you back yet?  LS: No shit... that's why I had to get out of there...No, he said he comes to Orlando every other week, and he'll give me a call then... I may call him later just so he knows I'd be interested in seeing him again... I was so tired Sunday that I may not have given that impression  KC: Did your fooling around include a hand-job or anything?  LS: No, actually he started by "pleasuring me"  KC: I see, very interesting. Unfortunately, work calls so I have to end our little interview, but I think we'll definitely have to pick this up at a later time since I obviously will be  living vicariously through Lynn's sexual escapades. It's been good talking with you, Lynn. Thanks for being on the show.  LS: Sure, no problem, it was fun! I'll talk to you later!

      Hello boys and girls, today I've got my brother with me for your listening pleasure. He's a wild one, so be prepared for anything. To begin:  KC: What would you say is the worst thing that has ever happened to you?  MC: hmmmmm...probably when mom had that surgery on her head.  KC: And why would you say that was the worst thing to ever happen to you?  MC: Because I was very scared and worried for quite a time.  It really stressed me out that I would lose my mom. that and I generally live a charmed life. ha ha ha. strike that from the record.  KC: Sorry, there's no record-striking in my interviews.  MC: say what! I'm rick james biotch! ok sorry, I'm back on target.  KC: OK superfreak, now that you've gotten that out of your system...conversely, what would you say is the best thing that has ever happened to you?  MC: being born.  KC: OK, besides that?  MC: ummm meeting [my girlfriend].  KC: I don't understand, you mean it hasn't been realizing that you have me as a sister? I'm confused...  MC: ha ha ha...its a tie...three way tie...those two and the day I discovered my penis...bwahahahaha...just kidding.  KC: Right, just like all men kid about their third arm. Now on a more serious note, have you ever been so scared that you pooped your pants?  MC: no I have never been soo scared that I lost bowel control or bladder control. however,  conversely I have laughed so hard that I had a little pee squirt come out.  KC: Expand on that, if you would.  MC: in what way. what made me laugh so hard or how the pee came out?  KC: Yes that, and explain the horror you felt when you realized that you could potentially pee your pants.  MC: well,  I was really drunk and walking back from the virginia tech home coming game.  when my friends and I spotted a pigeon and it had a little thing on its leg like a tube.  we thought it might be a messenger pigeon or something. so we all were slowly creeping up on it to grab it and see if it had a note!   as we were creeping quietly and stealthily another friend of ours came from behind and totally pelted the pigeon with an apple!  and just totally shot our game.  it was hillarious. we all started laughing. I laughed so hard that i felt a pee squirt come out, so I stuck my hand down my pants and squeezed my jimmie until I was done laughing. then peed on a tree. the fact that I was about to pee myself actually made it funnier to me.  KC: OK, that is pretty funny and I'm actually laughing really hard right now. So what is the craziest thing you've ever done?  MC: the craziest thing I have ever done. well,  I'll need a little clarification of "crazy." you have completely wreckless and stupid crazy, then you have totally unrestrained and adventureous crazy, then there is scare other people crazy.  KC: I think I am going to go with completely wreckless and stupid crazy. I'm sure that will be the funniest of them all.  MC: ok in that catagory I'll have to think a bit. I have an enourmous collection of those types of scenerios. one would have to be the time my friends from NY came to visit at radford. they decided to come visit us at radford and bought a 300 dollar vw rabbit to get them there. well when they got to radford we proceeded to do a bit of drinking that night,  and decided to crash test this rabbit, so we all put on our lacrosse equipment and bucked up into this car then proceeded to flip this car as many times as possible in various construction sites until the car would no longer run then left it where it was and hitch hiked back to campus not the craziest but a crazy one.  KC: Did you flip it while you were in the car or did you all push and roll it from the outside?  MC: inside, driving it, jumping stuff and hitting hills sideways and such.  KC: How many times did you get it to roll in one go? Was it like action movie kind of stuff?  MC: yeah totally. we could get it to roll like two times easy. but not much more then that. but not much more then that. but ultimately what made it no longer run.  KC: Really? Who would have ever figured on something like that? And the lacrosse equipment was enough to keep your heads from splitting open like plump melons?  MC: no one got seriously hurt. couple bruises and such. the worst side effect was everyone got sore necks.  KC: So you basically all gave yourselves whiplash?  MC: yeah.  KC: What are you going to do when you have a son and he does stuff like this?  MC: pray. make him do sports and lift. I think it made a difference in my survivability.  KC: Well, I'm glad you're planning on being a responsible parent. Who was the ugliest girl you've ever seen and what made her so ugly?  MC: the ugliest girl I've ever seen...bat girl is right up there. she was dispicable, spelling?  KC: She wasn't that bad looking. I think you just didn't like her personality. Surely you've seen uglier people. I know I have.  MC: she was pretty ugly too though. I mean sure I've seen recovered burn victims on the discovery channel, or those two gals who are attached at the head.  KC: Come on, Mike, I mean besides her nose going up that way, what was so bad? I'm laughing, by the way.  MC: she was short, dumpy.  KC: She wasn't dumpy, she was slim. And she wasn't that short. She was probably about my same height. Her main problem was that she was a weepy drunk, which I forgot every single time we went out, until she'd start crying.  Anywho, I'm noticing that my brother's responses are slowing considerably, so my guess is he has work to do. Join us next time when I hope to have another exciting guest. Ciao.

      Today I've got my friend Lynn with us. Lynn was my roommate my freshman year of college and a good friend. We also belonged to the same fraternity as little sisters. She basically brought me into the fold of that fraternity because I didn't like the first fraternity I ended up pledging as a little sister because the leadership of the chapter changed and it wasn't fun anymore. The boy who ended up being president was a big dick and apparently confused that with having a big dick. That's the good thing about being a little sister, if you drop out you don't have to worry about disgruntled boys throwing beer on you if they happen to run into you around town because, hey, it's not like you were a brother or anything. So let's get started:  KC: Who would you say has been the most influential person in your life?  LS:  KC: I sent this question to Lynn via e-mail and I haven't heard back from her, which means this interview is on hold until futher notice...

      OK, I'm about to puke because I've eaten one too many marshmallow peeps. Yellow bunnies. That's the problem with marshmallows, you don't know you've had too many until it's too late and then you just get that sick feeling. Uuuugh, I hurt.

      OK, today I've got my sister here to chat a bit. This should be a very interesting time since my sister is a snarky enough to be entertaining. So let's get started:  KC: What would you say is the most important thing to have happened to you in your life?  ACH:I think the most important thing to happen to me in my life, at this point anyway, is becoming a mother. But i think that it's tied with getting married.  KC: I see, and why would that be the case?  ACH: because it turned me from a person that thinks mostly about myself into someone that rarely thinks about myself....i am a much more selfless person, because of those to events. two events, that is.  KC: That's very interesting. Now, what is so funny to you that it makes milk come out of your nose if you laugh, while drinking milk, of course?  ACH: i do not believe that this has occoured to me in the past 20 years or so, so i cannot answer this question.  KC: Alright then, what is so funny it makes you pee your pants? And I know that only happened last night, so give it up.  ACH: the last thing that made me piss myself, while laughing was when [my son] recited the entire Blamange episode of Monty Python after only seeing it once.  KC: And would you say that was a full-on pissed your pants or just a little trickle that you were able to stop with your Kegels?  ACH: kegel stopper.  KC: So sorry to hear that, we were looking for a full-on piss your pants. At any rate, what would you say is the biggest mistake you've made in your life?  ACH: printing a story on an internet message board  KC: What story would that be?  ACH: btw, my kegels are well developed, so i'm pretty good at stopping pissing myself. i take the fifth.  KC: What do you mean you take the fifth? I'm your sister, there is no fifth. At least give me a little clue as to what the story was about.  ACH: it was about meeting a famous person, and that is all that i will say.  KC: Would that famous person be Simon LeBon of the 80's mega-group Duran Duran?  ACH: no, but i will be meeting him, soon....as soon as they get their asses back over hear from Europe. Steve and I were going to go and see them, but every date they were playing here, we were already going somewhere else. and i could give a shit about simon le bon....it's all about john taylor.  KC: Ah yes, how could I forget the way you dyed the front of your bangs blonde in a vain attempt to recreate yourself in the image of your much adored John Taylor....So, what's the best date you've ever been on?  ACH: jc, i can't spell  KC: Well, OK, but what about the date?  ACH: when stephen and i went to san francisco the first time  KC: Oh, that sounds so sweet. Why don't you tell our viewing audience a little more about that weekend.  ACH: he went to take his written board exam, and i was on spring break, so i flew out the day of this last exam. Needless to say, I was very nervous, so I downed about 10 screwdrivers between SLC and SF, which is only about a 45 min. flight, so I had to piss so bad that I raced to the lavatory as soon as the plane landed. I was in there for about 15 minutes, so poor Steve was standing at the gate thinking that I had changed my mind, so, when I finally came of the plane, he had a very big smile on his face. We spent two days going all around SF, and, believe it or not, we never had intercourse on that trip....he was a true gentleman.  KC: I'm sure we all appreciate your "truthful" retelling of your bedroom activities.  ACH:it IS true  ACH: btw, who is the "viewing audience? it better just be you and [your daughter] or I'm gonna kick your ass Bruce Lee style.  ACH: We were like Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski, I did not say that there were not other things that occured, but we did not have intercourse.  KC: Oh, and to answer your question, anyone who happens to stubmle across my blog has access to this enlightening interview.  ACH: oh, this is on your blog? why? what is the purpose of this little interview?  KC: This is my substitute to having my cable access interview show. So I'm going to interview friends and family on my blog.  ACH: what? are you telling me that you have a public access interview show? and, if so, why would anyone want to know anything about me?  KC: No, I don't have a cable access show, but have always wanted to have one. Since I don't, this is how I'm going to go about interviewing people I'm intertested in interviewing. See?  ACH: you know everything about me, so why do you want to interview me?  KC: Because I don't specifically ask you interview-type questions, so this is a way to learn even more about you while sharing the fruits of my efforts with the larger viewing public.  ACH: pure genious.ok, anymore questions for your illiterate sister?  KC: I'm afraid not. I have to go pick up [my daughter]. So this is me signing off for today. I hope you join me next time when my guest will be....I don't know.  ACH: hukd on fonix werks fer mi.  KC: Bye.

      I think I've definitely got something here with an interview format. I want to have a cable access show where I just sit and interview my friends or various other people I know because I'm pretty sure other people in TV land would enjoy the conversations I have with people just as much as I do. Now, I just have to figure out who is the next victim to undergo my public scrutiny of their mind and life.

      I have a guest with me today. Her name is Angela and she's sick with a cold, just like everyone else in this God-forsaken town. So let's begin:  KC: How does it feel to be sick right now?  AH: (Mumbles and puts head on desk)  KC: I see. What are you planning on doing while in NYC?  AH: Spending time with friends, finding true love, losing true love, getting over my cold, hopefully. Actually, eating Korean food, too.  KC: Sounds like a busy schedule. How would you bring about world peace?  AH: I would say start with interfamily conflicts first, before you get ahead of yourself.  KC: So you're saying solve problems within the family and that will spread peace and love to the rest of the population?  AH: Well, it's a start.  KC: I see, interesting perspective. So, what do you think of the current political primaries going on?  AH: I hope the vote isn't splilt among the Democrats and other third parties. As long as we get a Democrat in office, it should be OK. It goes back to the whole family thing, we have to solve the immediate clan problems before trying to deal with bigger problems.  KC: I am going to take this opportunity to state the opinions of the interviewee are not necessarily shared by the management. So, which actor are you hot for right now?  AH: Adam Brody.  KC: Who's he?  AH: He plays Seth the Jew on the OC. He's a lisping sarcastic Jew, my favorite.  KC: Hmm, that sounds interesting. If you had to, which sense you give up?  AH: Smell.  KC: Why?  AH: Most of my pleasures in life come from visual aesthetics, touch, music, but smell isn't that important. It's only important for me for food, but even when I have a cold, food is still OK.  KC: Well, Angela has left the building to go get some grub, so I guess I'll just do the talking for now. Today's been a normal kind of day. The kind of day that blends into the next and you don't even realize you lived it because it was so unnoteworthy. I do plan on going to a reading tonight at a local coffee shop, so that's something out of the ordinary. Although, it starts at 7:30 and that's when my motor starts to wind down. And if I drink coffee while I'm there, I won't be able to go to sleep when I get home. It's a no-win situation when you think about it. When I was little, I used to wonder why my parents always fell asleep on the couch so early in the evening and now I know. I know the sad truth of being so drained from the day that you don't even try to stay up to watch all those interesting late shows you wished you could watch when you were a kid.

      I agree I think Bill Murray should have won that oscar for lost in translation.   However,  on a different note I am quite pleased that Lord of the Rings Return of the King sweeped the oscars.  because a "nerd's" movie beat out all that hoity toity "drama"  crap.  I think seabiscuit should have one at least one oscar as well I thought it was a smashing film.  Well I'm going to be in Italy in april for 7 days  I'm quite excited because my girlfriends buddy is getting married there to some sort of an arab oil sheak or something like that  from the UAE.  He has rented a villa in cianciano for all the guests to stay in for free!  Christina will be going to flourence, rome, and pisa as well.  So that should be pretty awesome.  In addition I will be moving back to VA at the end of this month which is quite awesome for me!  I'm super glad I'll now be able to kick it with my people's and be near my family and girlfriend.    I would like to move to Austin, TX in a couple years I absolutely fell in love with that town!  It is soooo bad ass!!!! its my dream!    Remember everyone!  Up with hope Down with dope!

      So, I'm sitting here eating my Weight Watchers Smart Ones Fiesta Chicken. Try to say that in one breath. Yeah, it's OK, but only OK. Actually, most of the Smart Ones meals are fairly decent, but this Fiesta Chicken doesn't have enough salt. It's a little on the bland side. It still cracks me up that I can actually clog cyber-space with this sort of mindless  drivel and no one really cares. Just seems like a waste of resources to me, but, hey, if it gives me another outlet for mouthing off, all the better. Depeche Mode is playing. Filming and dreaming, dreaming of meeeeeee, yeah.   Yesterday I went to the American Idol site to find out about this William Huang that everyone is talking about and I don't understand why people say he can't sing. I mean, yeah, he looks a little bit dorky while he is singing, but his voice isn't that bad. It sounds like he can carry a tune, at least. This entire American Idol thing seems weird to me anyway. I've only watched a couple of episodes, just to see why people were so crazy about it and it doesn't seem all that incredible to me. I've only seen the audition segments on commercials, but I don't understand why people who absolutely cannot sing to save their lives go on this show when they know that Simon guy is going to insult them. You know, it was one thing when the show first started and people probably didn't know, but now everyone knows. And the ones who can't sing still seem shocked and hurt when he yells at them.   In general, though, I don't understand why he feels like he has to humiliate people in the first place. It takes courage to get up and perform in front of people, especially when you know the chances of being ridiculed are fairly high.   OK, here's another thing I want to know about.... What's the deal with Sean Penn at the Oscars and his comment about what actors know besides the fact that there were no WMDs? Yeah, when I think of someone who's really informed about world affairs, he's not exactly the first person who pops into my mind. And all that stuff at the beginning of the war when he said he would go be a human shield, so why didn't he? Because, of course, his past behavior has shown how much he cares about his fellow man, like when he's beating up photographers. Not that I'm defending paparazzi, because them do seem like a sleazy sort, but he doesn't exactly have a history of living a peace-loving sort of life. So Sean Penn, I say to you, shut up. Just because you're famous doesn't mean anything that comes out of your mouth is worth listening too. Cyberspace-clogging people like me are the only ones with anything intelligent to say. :-) And with that, I'm signing off for the day.

      I can't shake this cold. It just hangs around like a bad stalker. I definitely need stronger coffee in the morning. I used to get Starbucks at the little cafeteria by my building, but they got a new machine and the coffee's not as strong as it used to be. You can see right through it, which is not a good thing. It's got to be blacker than black to be any good. It shouldn't pour, it should sorta glop into the cup. Then you know it's good stuff.

      This post has nothing to do with the title, but you've got to put something down. I've been looking at some of the other blogs on Blogger and I wonder why so many of them are devoted to complaining. I'm a world-class complainer, mind you, but doesn't it just get boring after awhile writing so much about how your life sucks?  Anonymous Sample post #1: AHH!!! how?!?! everyone of you has finished her 2.4 km run!!! mine is tml!!! wat if i fail?!?! i'll die!!! oh, i won't cos if so i dunno die how many times becos of the 5 items loh... heihei... but i still scared scared. i dun wanna deprove from last year's timing... but most probably i will... sigh~ gotta resign to my fate.   Anonymous Sample post #2: I am so sensitive I am like a sponge. I absorb those around me. I absorb other's unhappiness, other's anger, other's pain. And once absorbed I carry it with me. Like I am the keeper of other's shadows.  Anonymous Sample post #3: people should learn to come early. or don't bother coming at all. they should be shot.  i feel like crap. something is hindering me. i think i'm scared of something. but i don't want to admit what it is. it pains me. it's eating my life away. bit by bit. little by little. nibbling till i'm totally gone.  ...i think it's nothingness. or the fear of it. it's starting to suck (like a fucking baby) the life out of me. i need to stick a pacifier in its teething mouth.  and how are we supposed to study econs when its full of fuck anyway?! if the bloody concepts are based on assumptions, then aren't we studying fantasy? i mean, the world is not made up of assumptions yea? if it was, it would be a happier(or fuckier) place. see, assumptions. how now, do you take me seriously? hahahaha. everything is a big fat joke.   See what I mean? In fact, if you think about it, this post is really just an addition to the wide world of complaints, because I'm basically complaining myself. But all that aside, I'm curious about what compells so many people to spill their disappointment out there for the rest of the world to see. Are they hoping that they'll get some sort of assurance that someone else's life is really much worse? Of course someone else's life is worse, that goes without saying.  I especially like the teenage angst blogs I've seen. You really do forget how crappy being a teenager is when you finally get past it. I worry a little bit about when my daughter finally gets there. I hope she'll trust me enough to come to me if she feels like she's really losing her mind. I find myself thinking about the past a lot. Just wondering if I would have done anything differently than I have. I can't really pinpoint one specific thing, but I definitely think I would have tried to be more involved with clubs and what-not in college. I really only did the little sister thing in college. I didn't take good advantage of the opportunities that are available in college. Oh yeah, and did I meantion, 80's music rules!!!

      Hi all. Today I'm interviewing one of my brother's friends. His name is Geoff, and according to my brother, he's REALLY crazy. So let's get started with the inquisition.  KC: Just by way of background, can you tell us how you know my brother?  GH: Symbolically, Mike is a smooth lover from around this world bound to drive any woman insane. Spiritually, we were destined to be great friends. Our good energies brought us together through common friends.  KC: So are you saying my brother's lovemaking skills are what attracted you to him?  GH: hahah. No, but his shit talking skills and ripping and rhyming antics did. that guy has a vocabulary and complementary animated move skill set the size of New York.  KC: I see, so you find him a kindred spirit in that you both talk without really saying something? Do I have that correct?  GH: Connection with Mikey C is rarely devoid of talking. That guy LOVES to talk. So that forms the meat and potatoes of our association, however we probably have been friends in past lives at some point. So I think we are connected at many levels, both verbal and nonverbal.  KC: OK, I understand. There's that strange nagging sense at the back of your head when the two of you are together that you're bound in much stronger ways than encompassed by this momentary physical existence?  GH: Quite true. He has purity and good will that are rare among many people my age.  KC: That's an interesting observation. Now, my brother says you are even crazier than he. I have to admit that the concept boggles my mind, so please share with our audience something you've done that outdoes his nuttiness.  GH: Very difficult to say. See, crazy people who are mutual friends probably have the tendency to illustrate the other as being the more crazy. I think that we probably form the most insanity when we are hanging out together. For example, we have gone stark raving mad atop a mountain in Skyline Drive, VA where at one point we were making people hiking the Appalachian Trail stop in their tracks and take a warm shot of bourbon. We enjoy becoming part of, or acting like, the local flora and fauna of any environment we are in. So that day, it was remarked by visitors that we looked like a bunch of drunk lizards lying out on the rocks overlooking the valley. We were, indeed, drunk lizards.  KC: Just lying drunk on a rock isn't exactly crazy, so there's a part of this story you're not sharing, so spill the beans. This is not an interview for the weak-hearted.  GH: will other members of Mike's immediate family see the data?  KC: Probably just my sister. My parents don't know about this blog. Even if they did, I don't think they'd be interested enough to read it. So everything's safe.  GH: We were hallucinating on Mushrooms, and nearly fell off a cliff because we could not keep our balance amid undulating peaks, hillsides, and valleys. How we managed to have intelligible conversations with other humans is beyond me.  KC: Who says it was intelligible? Do you have imperical evidence that proves the two of you were making any sense to anyone but yourselves? And I find the full unabridged story much more interesting.  GH: People appeared to respond to our diction in a normal fashion. their auras indicated that all was well, although one of our friends was drooling and giggling a little too much.  KC: OK, now I'm really laughing hard. Yeah, I think I can picture it. I have a question about the mushrooms. One of my past students loved to write short stories about his "shrooming" and the way he described the mushrooms sounded like they were the mushrooms the Smurfs lived in. Is that what they actually look like?  GH: not at all. they resemble that when they are actually growing (although there are all kinds of strains of psylocybin). but when you consume them, they are dehydrated. they look like a bunch of dried up scraps of vegetables.  KC: I've always been interested in how you buy them. Do you get them from your friendly neighborhood dealer?  GH: only trusted friends, or well-meaning hippies at music festivals. or culture and grow them yourself. Shrooms are not widely known to be part of the drug trade that criminal rings are involved in. They are very intense nonetheless, and must be consumed with great care and responsibility.  KC: So you're saying never do it by yourself? Do you have a designated straight guy?  GH: Doing them by one's self or with others is up to the user's discretion. I'd say they are much more fun in the presence of trusted friends, that are also participating. Environment is key. You must be in a situation of safety, and not surrounded by anyone with bad energy.  KC: Or hanging out on a cliff with a 90 degree vertical drop?  GH: That was, in retrospect, an unwise location because we were drinking whiskey, which made us too dizzy. But I gotta tell ya, the energy there was GREAT!!! Skyline Drive is a beautiful area.  KC: Yeah it is. I used to go there quite frequently when I still lived in Virginia. Now, I'd like to know about the auras you saw around the hapless hikers who encountered you on the mountaintop. How did you know they had good auras? What's a good aura and what's a bad aura?  GH: I'm not very good at reading auras, however shrooms drastically intensifies one's sensitivity to people's energies. For example, I was at home shrooming with friends a long time ago, and a bunch of belligerent drunk guys came through the door...they had very bad energy that caused me to interpret their faces as having varicose veins crawling around them. not a pretty sight. however, people who have love and joy and humor take on hues of a different nature. I've observed a woman's figure from afar at a music festival once, and was simply flattened by the incredible beauty of a female figure....flattened in a way far more intense than my normal appreciation for women's figures, which is quite high to begin with.  KC: So what's the scariest thing you've seen while under the influence of mushrooms?  GH: The naked truth behind some of my deepest and darkest fears, guilt, and shame and, if you are not experienced, you can be subject to a great loss of control of your own thoughts that can be very frightening and must be adequately dealt with in advance  KC: Give me a specific example. What was one of those naked truths for you?  GH: I came to terms with a relationship in which I was denying to myself how I really felt about things, and what I really wanted to do about it. Taken with caution, and validated separately through very sober and deliberate thought, shrooms can facilitate introspection and act as a "cut the bullshit, I'm your truth serum as to how you really feel about something."  KC: Do you find engaging in that level of introspection allows you to learn how to do it without the mushrooms eventually?  GH: Reliance on any drug is a pitfall and mistake. Occasional use for fun and introspection is beneficial, in my opinion. One should routinely develop the skills to be a deep thinker without the aid of anything but themselves and connection to the Divine  KC: OK, I'd like to shift gears here a little bit. What do guys REALLY talk about when they hang out?  GH: It really depends on the group of guys. I know groups of guys who want to talk about "banging chicks, and their brand new BMW", then I know guys like Mike who want to talk about everything from how they want to contribute to the world to every nuance of a DJ set, to how his hair looks like a Mon Chi Chi when he wakes up in the morning. Take a wild guess as to who I'd rather be with.  KC: What's the norm, though? I mean I'd really like to give guys credit and think the ones who talk about chicks and cars are few and far between.  GH: Between (ages) 13 and 30, I fear the opposite is true, especially in this country. There is a great amount of variation, depending on what culture you are talking about. It also depends on where one is at maturity-wise....you pick your friends based on what your needs and desires are....hopefully we all grow up over the continuum of our lives.   KC: If so many men are compelled to talk about women, what are they saying? Do they primarily talk about their latest conquest? And why are other men interested?  GH: The more immature guys are talking about conquests. The more evolved guys are talking about what it means to be in a relationship with a woman, and how it influences all facets of relationships, including emotions, sex, intellect, and the outside world. Other men are interested just like all humans are interested in each other; we don't want to go through life feeling alone.  KC: When it comes to interpersonal relationships, who do you think is more vulnerable--men or women?  GH: That depends entirely on situational factors in my opinion.  KC: What's your favorite kind of candy?  GH: Reese's Peanut butter cups. Go very well in ice cream. Ben and Jerrys.  KC: What's your take on the current presidential campaign?  GH: I think it is appropriately representative of a country that is deeply divided over what direction our country - a world power - should go in light of important crises that revolve around the resolution of how different countries and cultures are going to get along in a world of shrinking resources and environment. I'd be a happy man if GW was displaced from office. His tenure represents a strong set of opinions and ideals in this country, but fundamentally, we need to realise that they are misguided. The guy tries, but he really has the wrong idea.  KC: What do you think is the right idea?  GH: Every individual, country, and culture in this world needs to evolve beyond "taking care of our own". We need to extend ourselves, even risk ourselves to lead the world down the right path to being a member of the world citizen, not just a citizen of the country you were born in. The U.S. is in a unique position to lead this revolution. People just don't seem to get the fact that we are all connected as one. We fall to the delusion that we are separate.  KC: So has there really been any recent political candidate that impresses you as being able to guide the country in this manner?  GH: difficult to say. I will support Kerry because it is the most realistic candidate to enact a change in a positive direction. you have to start somewhere and young people need to get off their asses and vote?start caring.  KC: I find that interesting just because I don't view Kerry as a positive entity. He seems very willing to insult those who do not agree with his own political ideals and doesn't seem to care that unity isn't built by thumbing your nose at everyone else.  GH: I think that behavior is a product of our current political process, coupled with our media-addicted culture. I'm not saying he's perfect, but his baseline views and goals are better for our country's and world's long-term prospect.  KC: I'm curious to know if you and Mike talk politics.  GH: sometimes, yes.  KC: How do those conversations go?  GH: I'm a lot more familiar with his views on things interpersonal, rather than political. our conversations there are amicable, however I think we are a little different on how we would go about achieving the same goal. he's more conservative than I am.  KC: I see, do you mind if I ask your ethnicity?  GH: Caucasian.  KC: How do you view race relations in this country?  GH: they are evolving, but have a long way to go, and many socio-economic hurdles must be crossed. We're getting there though. I'd like to be positive about it.  KC: Oh, I almost forgot to ask you the most important question I had in mind: What is the size of your shvantz?  GH: you mean my shlong?  KC: Yes, my brother supplied the original term.  GH: about 71/2 inches on a good day.  KC: What do  you think about loin-stirring?  GH: what is loin stirring?  KC: You know the loin, the shlong, the third arm. It's a phrase regularly employed in trashy romance novels.  GH: Well, I have a Loin, and to stir it would probably mean masturbation, which all men do. so I say rock on! Break out the Mental Rolodex and mashem'  KC: What percentage of women would you guess masturbate?  GH: not enough. but still probably pretty high. 75%.  KC: How do you come by that figure? Just a shot in the dark?  GH: I took a Psychology of Sex and Gender class in college. That and talking to women that I date I bet its a cultural thing though...lots of variety depending on where you are from. PS I'm running out of time here - have work deadlines. hope you understand.  KC: That's perfectly OK. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us. It's been real.  GH: Right on kathleen. Peace and happiness to you.  KC: Thanks. Bye.

      OK, we've got Angela, our first interview, back again to lament her sucky love life. She says she hasn't had sex in eight months and really wants to delve into what that means for her.  KC: So, Angela, tell us just how sucky you think your love life is.  AH: I think facts, numbers that is, express the truth in its most painful form--I haven't had sex in eight months. The last boy I kissed was for New Year's and he never wrote back. Granted, he was my ex-boyfriend's college friend who couldn't do anything more because my ex, who was still hung up on me, was dancing in the livingroom. So that's the last anything I got. And a measly hook-up in November. It's all I can think about. I'm revirginated. And now, there's this 21-year-old kid who I can't talk to and it's frustrating. Yes, I know I'm very attractive and fun and some people think I'm bitchy. I basically have the mind-wiring of a 15-year-old boy.  KC: I must point out that, ironically, Cyndi Lauper's "She Bop" is playing right now.   AH: Why is that significant?  KC: It's about masturbating.  AH: Oh, I didn't know that. See that just goes to show you the affect Indiana has on me, I only started masturbating since I've been here.   KC: Only just started. Do you have tools?  AH: No, I don't. I'm worried I'll never leave my room. I like lips and I like to kiss, I like looking at another face. I like making someone fall in love me.  KC: I understand all of these things.  AH: And the best guys here, the most attractive ones, they're my good friends and I don't want to jeapordize that.  KC: I still think you just need to concentrate on getting the buddy NCMO hook-up. Just make an agreement with someone.  AH: The problem with my friends is that they are attractive, but I'm very particular about what I'm attracted to.  KC: When you're eyes are closed, the only thing that matters is how big their dick is.  AH: But I get aroused visually.  KC: Then imagine what you want while your eyes are closed and and let your fingers do the walking to get the tactile experience you're looking for. It's not as complicated as you're making it.  AH: Oh, I talked to a mutal friend about this boy and I said I can get a night out of it but my friend said I'm a diehard romantic, so I can do the seducing thing, but maybe I want more than a night or two.  KC: You know this also has a way of backfiring. What if he ends up really, really liking you?  AH: That would be excellent because it satisfies my ego as far as looks. And if he's smart and has eyes he should fall in love with me. I'm an older woman, I have a great resume, I have a cute personality, I dress well. Dude, I'm perfect. I don't understand.  KC: So what's your best trick in bed?  AH: Uh, that I'm there.  KC: That's not exactly what I'm talking about. Surely, you have some trick up your sleeve.  AH: Well, let's put it this way, we've all seen my appetite. I snore, I savor things, I'm loud and obnoxious. I am passionate. And I look really good when I'm aroused. I'm funny, I make them laugh. I have the whole exotic thing going for me. It's Indiana. I don't understand.  KC: Yeah, but can you make them blow a load while you're just looking at them at the coffee bar?  AH: See, I just feel so goofy, but I know that women have this looks, but I feel so goofy. But that's why I can't be smooth like that because when people do that I think you're so stupid because you are. The one strand of hope I have that he is interested is that he called me for coffee last week.  KC: You know, if you try to think about what is going on inside a guy's head too much, you're brain will explode. It's a known scientific fact. It's like trying to figure out where the circle begins and stops. It'll make you're brain explode. Do you consider yourself a modern, confident woman?  AH: Yes, but not with this boy. And Indiana has wrecked my self-esteem. I used to think I was the shit. I knew I was the shit at Harvard and San Francisco. Here I get asked if I live in China or I get asked out by high school drop-out stoners, or Serbian refugees, or middle-aged men with bleeding knuckles.  KC: But really, are you that concerned that people in Indiana can't properly appreciate you?  AH: Yeah, I feel different in the city and I had that one circumstance with the other grad student. It just threw me for a loop. I'm just used to more people pursuing me. I'm just a total mess about this senior who works in a coffee shop. I know my guy friends are really attracted to me. One told me I'd be afraid to date you because if I fell in love with you, you could fall in love with me, but I'd be afraid that you wouldn't love me the next day.  KC: Who said this?  AH: One of my guy friends Joel.  KC: So they purposefully keep themselves away from you emotionally?  AH: Yeah.  KC: Well they're just cowards.  AH: Well yes, and from the whole douchebag incident, these guys don't have any balls. Like you would have thought that if he really liked me and I was so aggressive, he could have me. And he was just had no balls. He made me feel like a predator. And now I worry with this coffee boy that maybe I am a predator.   KC: Why are you putting so much stock into a guy who was a major pussy? It's not worth so much.  AH: I know, but it's always the ones who don't want you that really fuck you up. Especially for me, I can take if you're not attracted to me, but if you are attracted to me you should fall in love with me because I'm hot and I'm smart and fun. I don't get it if I'm you're physical type. So my friends are worried I'm going to be a major slut or go for the first guy who shows interest because I've beed so deprived. And not to tout my own horn, but I think I'm getting better the older looking I get. (Burps.) Doesn't everyone like a drunk slut?  KC: I don't know. I am going to ask any of the guys who happen to read this to please comment in the space provided below.  AH: They need to see a picture of me so they know I'm not one of those girls who just thinks they're pretty. I just can't turn off my libido. I'm just bad at it.  KC: So you do want me to put your picture up?   AH: How would be do that? No, never mind.  KC: Anything else you want to say?  AH: How do I find more people attractive? I think that's my problem. I'm too narrow.  KC: I don't understand why you just can't have sex with someone you find marginally attractive but isn't your perfect type.  AH: I'm just very visual.  KC: I am. I'm going to buy you a blindfold and a motorized dildo with rotating head. Then you'll be able to think clearly.  AH: Why can't more people be creative like me? I don't know. I don't know. I should date older men. Oh, he just e-mailed me. Coffee boy just e-mailed back. He wants to know what's going on this weekend.  KC: Let me interview him.  AH: No!!!!!  KC: Why not? (I try to type out an addendum to Angela's e-mail and she physically restrains me.)  AH: Stop!!!!  KC: Just let me write the e-mail.  AH: No, STOP, STOP!!!! (Angela pushes me away.)  KC: OK, looks like we've got to wrap things up here because I'm freaking Angela out. Perhaps we can pick this up again next week. (Angela's cellphone rings).  AH: Oh wait, this is the high school stoner boy, put this in the interview. (Angela answers phone) Hello, hello. Battery running low. OK, well that ends that. (Phone rings again.) Hello, hey what's up. Just doing work. I'm at the office but I'm just not working.  Yeah, but I'm on campus. So I can't leave. Well, uuuuh. Well if you can get down here we can walk around here, otherwise, I'm here. My phone is dying so if you're coming you have to set up a time. My phone is dying. MY PHONE! I  just have to be at a dinner at 5:30, so anytime before then. (Hangs up phone.)  KC: OK, we're officially wrapping in up for the day. Tune in next time when we hope to expose the trashy underside of Angela's weekend. See ya.

      Why is it that sometimes you're just irritated? I'm irritated right now. Although I know exactly why I'm irritated. There's a particular person I must interact with who basically makes me want to punch his face in anytime I get an e-mail from him. I'm going to throw a few questions out there: 1. Why do certain people think the world revolves around them and that whatever little insignificant thing pops into their head is supposedly important to everyone else out there? 2. Why do certain people think they need to state the obvious? 3. Why do certain people think they even know what the hell is going on in the first place? 4. Why do certain people stay alive despite the fact that they've been threatening to kick the bucket for years anyway? Let me just say something. First of all, I know my job, aight? I don't need some spermatophobic geezer telling me what to do. Especially when said spermatophobic geezer has not a clue as to what I actually do. Second of all, I'm going to be forced to hit someone....really, really hard. Really. Wow. Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I don't feel nearly as irritated as I did before. The power of blog. It does a brain good.

      OK, I just finished sending back all the story manuscripts we turned down. It took me nearly four solid days of sludging through it to get them out the door. For those of you who think putting out a literary journal is glamorous, I'm here to tell you it's not. It's very tedious sometimes, and this was one of those times. I especially get aggravated with the people who don't bother including SASE's with their submissions. Those are usually the ones who really get bent out of shape when they don't hear back from you. "I submitted a story several months ago and have yet to get a response back. Your listing in Writers' Market states you respond within three months. It has been longer than three months. Can you tell when you'll get around to making a decision?" Hello, ever heard of a SASE. We all have to shell out the bucks required for submitting. Those are the rules. You're not special. Here's another bit of advise: If it's been a really, really long time since you sent the story out and no one's gotten back,it's probably been rejected. Also, bothering the editors does not make them speed up their review of your story. If anything, it makes them put it at the bottom of the stack so that it takes an even longer time to hear back. We're all busy, get over yourself.

      Not much of anything happening today. Went to my friend Elena's house last night and had some awesome homemade gnocchi. So good. It melted in your mouth. And now I know how to make gnocchi. It's not as hard as I thought it would be. My neck hurts. This might sound really geeky, but I am really excited about the new Harry Potter movie. My daughter really likes the Harry Potter books and I guess her enthusiasim is catching. The books really are very good, so if you haven't read them yet, you should. But I think it's easy to get excited about the movies because they've done a pretty good job with them. They've stayed pretty true to the books. Right now, my daughter is simultaneously listening the three HP books: She's listening to Sorcerer's Stone on tape when we get ready in the morning, listening to Prisoner of Azkaban on tape in the car when I drive her to school, and listening to Order of the Phoenix at bedtime when I read to her. We've definitely got the HP action going on up in here. And I think that's about it. Yup, that's it.

      I'm starting to get a little bit nervous about the upcoming cicada invasion. We're in a major cicada hotspot and I know, I just know, when those buggers start coming up out of the ground I am going to have some sort of apoplectic fit. It's going to be like a horror movie. Those bugs everywhere, swarming and dense. I'm not going to be able to leave my house until it's all over. I'm afraid, I'm really afraid. It's supposed to start any day, now. I'm going to spend this weekend creating a protective barrier and spray the heck out of my house so nothing will cling to it. I usually do this anyway because, just in case you haven't guessed, I HATE bugs. My husband doesn't like it when I do this because, apparently, it mutates the frogs that live around our house. This is true. I found one the year after I really did some serious spraying and it was missing back legs. He was mad at me, but I don't care. The thought of being covered head to toe with insects bothers me more.

      I just found out today that one of my stories is going to be published in  urlLink The New Yinzer , an online literary magazine. Needless to say, I am quite happy. Now I know you like me; you really, really like me. The magazine is based out of Pittsburgh, which also makes me feel all warm and mushy on the inside since my father is from the Pittsburgh area and I always have a part of me that thinks of Pennsylvania as home. So, yay for me.

      K, the show is tonight and my daughter told me last night she doesn't want to do it. Sigh. Poor kid. Life sure is hard. I told my husband to pick up a couple of roses for her on the way home so we can give them to her when the show is over. Make her feel like a real prima donna. That'll get her hooked. :-)   I've been thinking a lot lately about being thirtysomething and why it almost seems as confusing as being twentysomething. I've always assumed by the time I reached my 30s, I'd have figured out a few things about life. What I have discovered is that the more the know, the less you feel like you understand any of it. You think being an adult will teach you how to come to terms with mistakes you've made or lingering regrets, and it does somewhat, but there's still a little something always niggling away at the inside of your brain. Something that says you're not there yet and this cannot possibly be the life you're supposed to have.   I look at my parents in a completely different way now. I love them and all, but there's nothing mystical about them anymore. The way you always think of your parents as being all-knowing, it's not that way anymore. It makes me a little bit sad because there's a certain sense of security in thinking there is someone out there who can make everything OK for you.

      So my daughter has her kindergarten play tomorrow night and she's nervous, she tells me. Being a person who LOVES the spotlight, I'm finding I have no useful advice to give her. I tell her to channel her nervous engery into making her performance really *sparkle*. She says, "I don't know what you're talking about, Mom. I'm only six." I'm still not understanding how a child of mine is afraid of the stage. Oh well. She's dressing up as Alice in Wonderland. I just finished her costume last night and she looks good in it. We doctored up one of her stuffed rabbits to be the white rabbit. My daughter is obsessing over the fact that the pocket watch we made isn't hanging exactly the right way off his vest. She wants me to pin it so that the ribbon we're using as the chain will drape across at the proper angle. And I thought I was anal.  They just opened a Cold Stone Creamery in town and I cannot wait to go. I told my husband that's where he needs to take me for Mother's Day. I love Cold Stone Creamery. It's good. Mmmmm, ice cream.   The semester is almost up here, so we'll be on summer schedule pretty soon, which means I'll be working all by my lonesome for the most part. It's not so bad  because I can get a lot of work done. But it really sucks when there is no work and I'm just sitting there picking my nose.

      Well, the child is back. My mother finally brought her home a couple of days ago and, as predicted, she's already driving me crazy. This time because she's developed some very bad habits over the last three weeks and seems to think she can just do whatever the heck she wants. I figure she'll be finished with time-out by the end of the weekend. It's good we keep her in the bathroom for time-out, so we don't have to worry about any messy accidents during her confinement. I'm glad to have her back home, though. Three weeks is an awfully long time.

      The Cure is playing on the streaming radio station I like to listen to. Cool beans. Looks like it's going to be good weather this weekend, which bodes extremely well for my barbeque. Maybe the child is coming home tonight, maybe not. Hopefully, she'll be home tonight. But you never quite know with my mother. Apparently they were all in Ocean City for the past couple of days. Wish I could've been there. I wish I could interview someone. If you know someone interesting, let me know about them. It would seem I've exhausted my supply of interesting people. I've sent out a couple of stories in the past week. We'll see how this round goes. I'm sleepy and my neck hurts. If I ever get really rich, I'm going to hire a personal chiropractor to crack my neck for me whenever I desire it.

      I really don't want to be here right now. I'd rather be home so I can clean the place up for the barbeque this weekend. Instead, I'm forced to sit here and look at a computer screen doing nothing useful. I used to wonder when I still worked for the government how people could stand to be so unessential. The little known secret outside the government is that once you've worked there for three years, it's basically impossible to get rid of you no matter how useless you are. You can only get fired if you fuck up royally--meaning you fuck up in a way that can't be hidden from people on the outside.   When I worked at NIH, the only person I knew of being fired was this completely gross grant analyst who made passes at female PI's when he went on site visits. Needless to say, you can't cover up numerous complaints from highly educated women accussing a government hack of sexual harrassment. Now, if he'd limited his perverted attempts to inhouse women, nothing would have happened to him. So really, he was fired more for being too stupid to follow the unwritten rules of government employment rather than for legitimately deserving to be canned.  The federal government really is an interesting world. The only people who make it a lifetime endeavor are those who don't want to do anything for a living. Anyone who really wants too accomplish something good and decent leaves in frustration because no one's interested in that. They like sitting there getting their paycheck for nothing. The populace should rise against the system and revolt and demand real outcomes for their tax dollars. Of course, for that to happen, the populace has to have some clue as to what the hell actually goes on. So, needless to say, nothing will ever change. Why does the average citizen care so little about what goes on? People complain about the way modern politicians are all spin and nothing else. Do people really think they'd spend so much time selling the superficial if it didn't work? The blame rest squarely on your shoulders, Joe Schmoe. Why don't you take the effort to vote? Why don't you take a little bit of time to read a newspaper and find out what really goes on in the world? Why don't you try to look at the bigger picture? Americans are so lazy. and I'm tired of watching talking heads who avoid real questions. What's wrong with answering a question honestly? Is anyone stupid enough to think every answer out of a politician's mouth is going to be something they actually want to hear or will agree with? Can that be said of anybody on the planet? No. People need to not take stupid shit so seriously.

      So, I really have nothing to talk about but I am going out of my mind with boredom. I figure rambling on the ole blog should fill a little time. I saw this program the other night on Discovery channel about face transplants. There are three surgical teams around the world currently working on performing a face transplant. The hope is that this sort of surgery would make it possible for people who have been severely injured and deformed by, say, fire to live relatively normal lives again. The doctors want to transplant the face of a dead donor onto the receipient's face. It was really fascinating. It was particularly interesting because the night before watching this program, I happened to watch this movie on HBO called Something the Lord Made about the first heart surgery.   The show and movie parallel each other because they both deal with radical new surgeries of their time. It's interesting to watch how ignorant it seemed for doctors to be so afraid to operate on the heart back then because heart surgery is so common place now. You wonder why were they so afraid. But watching the show on face transplants, you see that that's how many people are greeting the idea of this type of surgery. There's a lot of fear. Like heart surgery today, I'm sure face transplants won't phase a soul in fifty years.  I am now heading into my third week without the child. I miss her. Although, I'm sure when she's back and we're caught up in the normal routine of life, I'll wonder why I spent so much time wishing away my freedom. We always want what we don't have, stupid humans that we are. We've got the big barbeque this weekend. Should be fun. Hopefully the good weather they are predicting will hold true.

      I just finished reading a piece from my thesis director, Valerie Sayers. It's a "confessional" in Image. She talks about her experience being diagnosed with cancer. I was just finishing up the program in 1999 when she got the news. It was interesting reading her account because we outsiders have a completely different memory of it, as it should be. My friend Elizabeth and I were terribly upset by it at the time because she's such a neat lady. But reading her article makes me feel sad because it makes me realize how much of ourselves we hold back from the rest of the world. How many times in life we hurt like hell on the inside and never let it show. Maybe it's a woman thing, I don't know. Why do we do that? Why do we feel like we don't have the right to let everyone know exactly how we feel? Why do we have to put on sunny faces to make everyone else feel comfortable when we're screaming on the inside? Why can't people deal with the screaming? Sorrow and pain are just as much a part of life as happiness and joy. People are allowed to feel those things, too. Why do we have to be ashamed of it? Anyway, it makes me a little bit ashamed to think about the important people in my life right now who are dealing with really hard issues because I think I should do more to let them know that their struggles aren't invisible.

      Well, I'm home alone for the first time in ten years. How lovely it is to be me right now. My husband and daughter are off visiting my parents for a week. I couldn't go because I don't have enough vacation. But being alone and not having to do anything for anyone is a really nice break all by itself. Nights are creepy, though. It's too quiet at night, but everything else is OK. I'm hoping to clean a lot of junk out of the house while they're gone. My daughter doesn't play with about half the stuff she has, but god forbid you try to get rid of any of it while she's around: "Moooom, I still like that."  "You never play with it."  "But I still like it. I'm going to play with it right now."  Anywho, when the cat's away, the mouse will throw all the shit out.  I've just linked to my friend Lynn's blog. I encouraged her to start a blog to vent some of her frustration over not finding a job. Any of you peeps out there reading this, go take a look and see if you can hook her up. She deserves to have a job that will let her realize her full potential.

      We went to watch "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" Friday night and it was alright. This is the first of the HP movies I've watched where I'd read the book beforehand and knew the story. It definitely gives watching the movie a new perspective. I was a little surprised by the things they didn't include in the movie from the book. Little things, really, but still somewhat significant in my mind in terms of understanding the characters and where they're coming from. My daughter really enjoyed it. This is the first of the HP movies we've let her watch in the theatre. We waited until the first two came out on DVD before letting her watch them. But like me, she knew the story ahead of time on this one and she felt that she wouldn't be too freaked out to watch it on the big screen. All in all, she was OK. She was only freaked out at the very first appearance of the dementors in the movie, but at least she knew what they were and what was going to happen, so it wasn't too much of a freak out. She was fine with the rest of the movie.

      Methinks there is something awry with Blogger. Either that or my brower's screwed up. But who cares? I'm almost out of here for my vacation. Of course, I still need to do more packing and cleaning before take-off, so it's not a completely worry-free day. It's a gloomy day today. Figures. Friends of ours are keeping the guinea pigs while were gone. They picked them up last night. This morning my daughter woke up, looked at their empty tank and said, "I feel like this big chunk of  my heart is broken off and sinking down to my stomach." Naw, she's not melodramatic.   My husband just called me to tell me he mailed the bills. I said OK, then he said, "We're going on vacation." I said OK.   Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to be getting out of town for awhile. I just can't think too much about being gone until we're actually gone. I've still got too much other stuff to check off the list.

      I just got off the phone with a man who called the office and ended the call by saying, "Thanks, Hon." He had a southern accent. I'm not saying this explains the use of "Hon," but it probably does. I'm always surprised when men use these type of words when dealing with women in a professional setting. It's no secret that most women don't appreciate being referred to as hon, sweetie, baby, or little gal in the workworld. Why does it still happen? I think it's because so many men can no longer rely on the "old-boy" network to succeed today the way they used to, and they use these terms to create an environment of hostility. They're trying to throw women for a curve and get them all flustered and emotional.  Personally, I'm not intimidated by it, but it does get me steaming mad.  It makes my eye twitch.  We spent a really pleasant evening at home last night with our friends Chris and Sue from DC. I feel old now, though. The last time we saw them, their oldest son was still a toddler, and the youngest a baby. Now they're 11 and 8.  Our daughter had a great time playing with them. They all got along really well. We spent the entire evening talking and reminiscing about the "old days."  We laughed particularly hard over the time Chris helped my husband and I move into our first apartment together. It was February and there had been a recent snowfall. My husband lived in Dupont Circle, which is in the city, and this guy who lived a couple of buidlings down asked Chris and my husband to help him get his car out the alley. He couldn't get out because he couldn't get any traction in the snow. Anyway, he got in the car and Chris and TIm tried pushing him out, but it didn't work. He was sliding too much. So they asked him if he had an kitty litter they could sprinkle under the tires. He says sure and comes back with some that he spreads behind the wheels. He gets back into the car and revs the engine. When he does that, the tires spin and pelt the two of them with the kitty litter. They manage to get him out and when they come back to finish moving the furniture out of Tim's apartment, I notice that they smell like shit--cat shit to be exact. The guy and put down USED kitty litter and basically sprayed the two of them down with shit and piss. He was driving a Jaguar, which I think explains his intelligence level. Anyway, we laughed pretty hard remembering that one. :-)  We hit the road tomorrow evening for our two-week vacation. As I mentioned before, I don't know what I'll be doing from day to day as I've left all planning to my husband. However, I do plan on checking in with audio posts so that you can all share in our wonderfully exciting adventures on the road.

      Our friends from DC will be in tonight. Should be a lot of fun. I'm debating whether or not I actually want to go to the trouble of putting on make-up. If we end up taking pictures, then I'll wish I put on make-up. Yeah, guess I'll get gussied up. When I was a teenager, I'd rather have my fingernails pulled out by the roots  than go out without make-up. Now, it seems like such a hassle most of the time. My mother complains about my laziness: "You used to take so much care with your appearance and now you look like a slob."  I try to rationalize my lack of personal grooming  by telling myself, "I'm in Indiana. Even on my worst days, I still come out looking better than 75% of the population here." Of course, when I go to Chicago or back to DC, I feel like a complete backwater hick. I do shower everyday. That counts for a lot.  I know some stay-at-home moms who seem to think that's optional. I never shared that point of view. I had friends who stopped showering when they started college and I never got that either. Just because your mom's not around to tell you to clean yourself up,  you'll actually let yourself smell like a rank armpit? And as if not showering weren't bad enough, they were proud of it. "Hey, it's been four days since I showered." No kidding. That explains the green haze following you down the hall.  I remember when we lived in Germany, people would stink something horrible. That's when I learned about the European aversion to deodorant. What doe Europeans think when they come to America and everyone is so afraid of body odor. Do they think walking around smells like going into a Bath & Body Works shop? Is it offensive to them? I'm going to go hunt down a European walking around right now and ask them.

      I've been looking at a blog that suggests one can increase their hit count by merely mentioning a naked celebrity.  Brad Pitt Naked . I'm going to see what that does.  Sting Naked . Surely someone is interested in seeing Sting naked.  Lenny Kravitz Naked .  Lenny shows off too much of himself as it is, which would be fine except that he ends up revealing too much of what a freak he is. What's with the nipple rings, Lenny?  Is it wrong that whenever I see a man with nipple rings I just want to grab it and rip the thing right out? It's really more out of curiousity than anything else. I'm not particularly offended by them or anything, but there's something about a ring hanging there like that. It's like the ring in bull's nose. If I ever saw one in real life, I'd want to pull on that thing too.

       urlLink     urlLink Which Annoying B-list Celebrity Are You?    urlLink Brought to you by Rum and Monkey.    Apparently, I'm Pauly Shore, which makes sense in a weird way. For some inexplicable reason, I really like Pauly Shore movies. Don't know why. It defies explanation. All I know is that's the way it is.

      Well the countdown to vacation has begun. I haven't been on vacation since last summer, so I really need one. My husband has planned the entire trip. I told him I just want to get in the car in the morning and not think about anything. And I don't want to rush. We'll stop off to visit my sister in Missoula, but other than that, I have had no input into the planning of this trip. Should be interesting how it turns out.   I'm wondering about Gillian Anderson. Is she British? I watched this episode of Graham Norton where she was on as a guest and she was speaking with a British accent. I thought she was American. Graham Norton showed her pictures of where she lived as a child in England, but I never totally got whether she's actually British or not.   Man, I am tired. I'm sitting here wishing I could just lie down and take a nap. Maybe I will. I've actually tried that before, but it doesn't work. I lock the doors and turn off the light and lie down but I'm always paranoid someone will coming knocking and the lag time in getting to the door will seem weird and then they'll suspect something is going on and when they see I'm the only one in the office, they'll know I was trying to take a nap. I had a supervisor once who actually kept a camp mat in her office for naps. She'd tell us she was going to snag a snooze and close her door. I used to think (well I still think) that she was a complete moron. And she really used to wonder why none of us in the office had any respect for her. She'd also have to write everything down on a sticky note. Her entire office was decorated with sticky notes. I used to contemplate putting up random sticky notes with any old shit written on them just to create an altered reality. You know, stuff like "Pick up dry cleaning," or "Meeting with Dr. V @ 3:00." I never did it, but I should have. It would've been funny to see if she actually did the things I left on the notes.

      I've really got to get a proper fitting bra. Ever since I had my daughter and finished nursing, I haven't been able to figure out what bra size I should be wearing. Before I got pregnant, I was a 34A. But I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be wearing anymore. It's really frustrating. I've tried 34A, 34B, 36A, and none of them seem to be quite right. Victoria's Secret has free bra sizing, but I'm a little paranoid after watching episodes of  "What Not to Wear" that strange women will be manhandling my tits in way that frightens me.   It's strange because there are nameless, faceless strangers walking the streets who have seen parts of my body under the harsh, unforgiving brightness of hospital lights that men I've had sex with never got a good look at, but I don't want strange women touching my boobs just to figure out my bra size.

      Today I'm feeling like I'm nothing more than here. I just spent the last hour watching Madonna videos on my computer. I love how modern technology gives you so many ways to screw around at work. Just think, when I first started working, the most I could do was play solitaire, now I can watch music videos. Woohoo. There's a stream of consciousness exercise I've done before in my writing workshops where you listen to music and write whatever comes to your mind. Let's try that right now and see what happens. I'm listening to music. Let's see what it inspires.  Sometimes when I"m jogging I imagine all the paths I could've taken in life. The funny thing about choices is that you only get to see one to the end when the possibilties are limitless. Take today for example: what happens tomorrow follows from what I do today. How many possible tomorrows are there? I wish we could have a television set that would play all the alternate endings to a life, just like a DVD special feature. I'm interested in the fork in the road. Where does it come in a day? Which second presents the possiblity for divergence? We all think our days are pretty predictable, and I guess they are for the most part, but one day the unexpected happens. I'm thinking of my uncle right now. He was up fixing his roof and had a heart attack and died. My aunt had gone to the store when he was on the roof and when she came back, he was on the ground with the neighbor trying to revive him with CPR. I think of my uncle waking up that morning. He figured he'd be putting his head down in the same spot from where he'd just lifted it, and that's not what happened. Who wakes up thinking this is the day I'm going to die?   The other day a commercial came on for the Make a Wish Foundation and my daughter asked what it was. I told her it's an organization that gives wishes to sick children who will probably die and won't get the opportunity to make their wishes come true for themselves. She asked why they die and I told her they die because theire bodies can't keep going anymore. It made her really sad and she said kids don't deserve to die and I said, no they don't, but it happens. So many possible tomorrows and we spend so much time cursing the moment as if it's eternal, as if there's not the possibility for some new thing right around the corner.

      I don't think I'm utilizing my blog's full capabilities. I'm looking at some other blogs and see that people make numerous posts a day and detail every last second of their lives. What I really wonder is how do they have time to make so many posts. Sometimes my husband spends his entire evening on the computer and I often think it's excessive. My daughter has been getting into the act lately and saying,"Dad, don't you want to spend time with your family." Kids are sooooo good at dishing out the guilt. Of course, computer time hasn't been so much of a problem since I got the Gamecube. My husband and daughter are plugged into that thing for a good couple of hours a day. On the one hand, they're spending time together because they play together. On the other hand, I don't want my daughter turning into a vidiot. I'm actually a little surprised at how much she seems to enjoy playing because I always thought girls didn't get into video games the way boys do.   But it's funny to watch my daughter when she hears the video game turn on if she's in another part of the house. Her head jerks up like a prarie dog catching the sent of a coyote and she listens very carefully until she's sure that, yes, the video game marathon has begun. Then she tears into the livingroom screaming, "Dad, wait for me. Don't start without me." Yeah, some real Kodak moments being created here.   We've only got the one television, so when the games are on, that's my cue to go entertain myself.  I'm sometimes tempted to get another t.v. for our bedroom. but there have been several studies lately that suggest children become too disconnected from the family when they have the means to hole themselves up and watch t.v. on their own. I'd never let my daughter have a t.v. for her room, but I don't want her being able to watch it anywhere in the house when we can't directly monitor it. Sounds Orwellian, I know, but t.v. today is not what it used to be.

      We got some good news last night--friends of ours from DC are going to be in our neck of the woods next week and will stop by for dinner. We haven't seen these folks in years. Chris and Sue and their two sons. Chris was my husband's best man and they used to work together at the bakery. They've never met our daughter, so it'll be great fun catching up with everything and everyone.   It's interesting, I still think of DC as home, although I'll probably never live there again. The traffic there is too crazy for real life. You literally spend half your day in the car trying to get from point A to point B. Not a good way to spend your time.  I do miss the variety and sophistication of the place, but I'd rather spend time with my daughter and see her grow. In DC, we'd probably only see her a couple of hours a day between work, school and commuting.  Although I sometimes feel as if I'm trapped in Mayberry living here, at least the pace is slower. And that counts for a lot when you've got a family. Also, living in a major metropolitan area tends to be pretty superficial. People are too concerned about the way they look and everyone's too worried about having more than the next guy. It's all just shit and people fool themselves into thinking it's really a life worth living. No thanks, I say.   I'd also like to take this time to put in a special plug for one of the blogs I'm linked to. If you haven't already, go take a look at Desperate Dad. B-day is fast approaching, and I wouldn't want any of you to miss the ride. :-)  P.S. You'll also see that I've been reincarnated as breakfast cereal.  What's really odd, though, is that it's not the first time in my life.

      There's an ant walking on my window and I'm wondering if it's worth the trouble to get up and kill the little bastard. Oops, now I don't see it. Too late. My brother-in-law's mother passed away last week. I'm not  particularly  close to my brother-in-law. He's  not a bad guy or anything. We're just in-laws, if you know what I'm talking about. At any rate, it's never easy when you lose a parent (not that I know from personal experience, thank God). His mother died of cancer. I'd only met her a couple of times, but she seemed to have a very sad life in that she always seemed to me to just be biding her time. I just can't imagine thinking life is so not worth the effort that you just simply exist. That's what her life was like. Sometimes I think now that the days of my life blur into one big haze, but what if that haze were filled with nothing more than getting up in the morning only to wait until it's time to go to sleep at night. My life's a haze because there's so much packed into it. Her life was a haze because there was nothing to fill it. There's, of course, a lot of background to the whole thing, but it'll take more time to explain than it's really worth. Let's just say she was as much to blame for the emptiness of her life as anyone else. All I know is that when I finally check out, I'd like to think people wake up the next day and realize something's different. I'd hope that my absence is as tangible as my presence.

      So we have to endure every parent's worst nightmare this weekend and take the child to Chuckie Cheese. (spooky background music here) I hate Chuckie Cheese, which is in direct correlation to how much my daughter loves it. But we told her she could pick the restaurant where we celebrate her good grades. If you've never been to Chuckie Cheese, it's basically a real-life manifestation of  Lord of the Flies.  It's just kids, loads of crazy kids running around like lunatics. Add to that the fact they're all suped-up on sugar, caffeine and grease from the soda and pizza. The flashing lights, I'm sure, increase their agitation by inducing some sort of hyper-stimulated brain wave activity. It's nuts, man. I'm telling you, it's nuts. I usually just sit and wait it out while my husband and daughter play the video games, but I've been told I WILL be playing games on this visit so that my daughter can get as many tickets as humanly possible. The reason for earning tickets, of course, is to trade them in for useless little toys that only cost a fraction of what you paid for the tokens to win the tickets in the first place. It's genius when you think of it. I'm sure Chuckie Cheese, Inc. is rolling in the dough. Did you know, by the way, that the guy who started Atari is the person responsible for Chuckie Cheese? It's true. He wanted to have a place to put his video games, so he came up with the idea of Chuckie Cheese, not knowing the restaurant would prove a stronger animal than Atari.

      So the books finally  came in today and I've just spent the entire afternoon on the mailing. Wow! It was the most fun I've ever had. That's a lie. I'm sitting here thinking about going grocery shopping before I pick up my daughter rather than after. My primary reason for wanting to shop without her is that I get away cheaper for the trip when she's not with me. I remember when my siblings and I were children we'd drive our mother crazy by re-enacting the commercials for every product she picked off the shelves. My daughter doesn't recite the commercials as much as tell me  why  I should get a certain product.  "Mom, this helps you clean everything really quickly. Like, super quick." "How do you know this?" "I saw the commercial, and it worked really fast." "What do we say about the stuff on television?" "It's a lie."  Well, I am off to grocery shop sans the child.

      I've linked to a new blog.  urlLink Life in Debt.  Anyway--not to make any of my fellow bloggers nervous by making you wonder what people must think of your deepest thoughts--this guy is seriously messed up. He's 33 and apparently suffers from a spending addiction that has sent him down a  very  troubled path. Assuming everything on the blog is true, he is tortured. There's no doubt about that. Reading his blog is like watching a car crash.  Just go read it for yourself. But my main reason for pointing out this link is because he confesses to his infidelity. The fact that he's cheating on his wife isn't what's necessarily so shocking. Rather, it's disturbing to me how nonchalant the whole thing is. He feels bad about it, but it all seems to happen so casually--as if by accident. "Ooops, so sorry about my penis falling into your vagina like that. Do pardon me." It makes me wonder about men in general. Not that I think all men are destined to wander, but when it does happen, is this how it happens.   I had an anthropology class in college where the professor said the only animals who mate for life are those where the male and female are externally, virtually indistinguishable from each other. Like Gibbons. This means there aren't many species that naturally mate for life. He called male mate-for-lifers 'dads' and the rest 'cads.'  Did you know that male chimpanzee have been observed to basically 'gang-bang' female chimpanzee? They rape them. Obviously, they're cads.  Anyway, from a stictly biological point of view, human men would be cads. This raises the question, then, whether or not humans fight their internal programming by forcing themselves into monogamous relationships. Just so you know up front, I believe anyone who would try and use this line of thinking as a serious justification for cheating is an ASS. But I'm playing devil's advocate right now. So is this how a person ends up in an extramarital affair? They just fall into it. I do find it interesting how people try to deny their free will by suggesting they "can't help themselves." What does that mean? This is not a topic I spend any time pondering upon, but Debt's blog just got me wondering.   P.S. Although I said I wasn't planning on placing many audio posts, I think I just might end up doing that while we're on vacation next month.

      I'm trying to determine if my daughter's recent behavior is reflective of her age or her disposition. It seems a couple of girls have been making fun of her name at the summer program she attends. Of course, this hurts her feelings. However, she's not been telling them that it hurts her feelings and is too embarrassed to say anything to the teachers. I asked her why and she said because that would be mean. She seems particularly sensitive to this type of treatment and doesn't seem to have the confidence to stick up for herself. I try to explain to her that letting her feelings and disapproval be known to the offending parties does not constitute "meanness," but she's not interested in listenting to that. My husband just says she should punch them out.  Luckily, she's a smart girl and usually responds, "DAD!!! That's not the right answer." Of course, I'm silently agreeing with the old man, but we can't really let her think that's a legitimate coping tool.  I just don't know how I managed to produce a child with such a dearth of violent tendencies considering I usually  was  one of the kids who hit first and talked later. That only happened a handfull of times, but  still, I'd hit 'em.   So I'm left trying to figure out how to get her to stand up for herself. I changed tactics a bit and tried to explain to her that she can't control other people's behavior, but she can always control hers. I told her she doesn't need to be hurt by these girls because they have no impact on her life if that's what she chooses.  They're vapor and as consequential to her life as dung beetles. Strangely enough, she seemed to grasp that better than contemplating speaking up for herself.  Explain that one to me.

      Because they suck, that's why. Before I rejoined the rat race of Mon.-Fri., I was fortunate enough to only work Tues.-Thurs. Little did I know what a leisurely pace that was. I always had a four-day weekend. Not that my house is ever as clean as I'd like it to be, it certainly came closer to it when I had the two extra days to work on it. Now I feel like I'm drowning in my own filth. We definitely need to get the vents cleaned. I'm sure that will make my life a little better.   I had a weird dream the other night. I'm in a public restroom pulling down my pants and underwear when I notice a shadow pass over me from the corner of my eye.  I look up and there's a man staring down at me from over the stall wall. What's that supposed to be about? I'm sure somebody would say it has something to do with a fear of being exposed, but that's not really a fear for me.  But it's weird. I have these dreams that don't seem connected to anything going on in my life and even as I'm dreaming them, in the back of my mind I'm wondering where does this come from. I have dreams sometimes where I'm screaming in the dream and I can tell that my body is actually trying to scream too, but I can't get the sound out of my mouth. I'll be somewhat aware of trying to scream and knowing it's not working. Those are weird, too. When I was studying French in high school and college, I'd sometimes have dreams in French where I understood everything and I spoke it properly, but I knew if I were awake, none of it would make sense as well as it should. How can you speak better French in your dreams than in real life?   I still remember that my first sexual dream was about Rick Springfield. I was in the 8th grade when I had it. Rick and I are walking down a hallway to his apartment. He's wearing a red satin shirt. It's open about three buttons down from his neck so you can see his chest hair. In the dream I thought this was really alluring, but in real life, I hate chest hair. Come to think of it, I don't even know if Rick Springfield actually has chest hair. So we get to his apartment door and he opens it and we walk in. There are candles everywhere and a fire is going in the fireplace. I am wearing a white blouse and tight Jordache jeans. In the dream I was grown-up and not an eighth-grader. So I sit down on the couch next to Rick and we start kissing, very tenderly as first, but then Rick becomes more demanding. I become lost in the heat of it all and I respond quite enthusiastically. It's all basically like a trashy romance novel after that. We don't actually have sex in the dream, but Rick does unbutton my blouse and performs  a lot  of nipple licking and sucking. At some point I take his shirt off, too, but we never take our pants off.  Those stay on the entire dream.  Anway, I woke up and had those strange tingling feelings (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) that I just didn't understand.  I remeber feeling quite satisfied with myself thinking I was old enough to have sex dreams. I never did dream about RIck again after that, but he always holds a special place in my heart.

      I am tired. It's just the end of the week, I guess. I'm sitting here trying to decide if I'll drag my lazy ass to the gym to run after work or not. I love the internal debates I have when it comes to exercise. I really do enjoy it, and I always feel good after I've run. The problem is when I'm sitting here and I fell soooooo tired, I convince myself it's more trouble than it's worth. No, I'll go run because I've been traveling and I haven't gotten into the gym yet this week.  Why are all Sinead O'Connor's albums after the first one crap? What happened?   The magazine is supposed to come from the printer today. We'll see if that actually comes to pass. My friend Elena stopped by last night with the girls and the baby. He's only a week old, but he seemed pretty alert in the eyes. He kept his eyes steady and focused. He is a cute little monkey. You just forget how helpless they are when they're that young. You know, just a floppy bag of skin and bones wrapped up nicely in poop.  The one thing I've always wondered about with babies and poop is how they get the projectile pooping up the back. Tell me how it's possible from a physics point of view. Seriously, from which angle and at what speed is the poop coming out of their butt so that it ricochets perfectly off the diaper to blast right up their back? In the whole scheme of things it wouldn't be so bad if this incredible projectile pooping happened when you had a change of clothing and loads of wet wipes. But, of course, that's not when it happens. Not ever.   But it is so obvious to me when I see little new-borns that I am perfectly happy with the one child. She really is all I need, And I love the size of our little family. It's the perfect size to me. I never get those odd urgings for another one when I hold a baby. Doesn't do a damn thing for me, thank God.  We're at three weeks and counting until we leave for our vacation out to Washington state. It should be a really good time. My husband and I haven't had a really nice, leisurely road trip since our honeymoon. I'm really excited about showing my daughter all the tacky tourist stops. You know life ain't nothing till you've seen the biggest ball of twine in the world and a two-headed snake.

      I had an interesting "discussion" with my husband this morning. He asked me how Michelle and Bennett were doing with the babies and I told him that it's the same old thing: the mother is soooo tired and the father is trying but the mother still feels like she's not getting the sort of help she actually needs and the father just feels like the wife is harping on him because she doesn't give him any credit. Of course, we suffered through exactly the same thing when we had our daughter. Anyway, as we were having this "discussion," defending our respective sexes, I found it amazing how quickly the hackles rise on this subject.  Men, your women are dead tired. They have just pushed your progeny out of their bodies into the world. But that's not the end of it. Once that business is taken care of, they get to be big ole lactating cows. From you to the baby--we never get our tits back. Right now, we really do think we hate you. We look at your face and we want to bash it in. That's the God-honest truth.  You don't seem to take initiative on anything. You just sit there and let us handle it all without coming to the rescue without being asked. You've got to realize we don't have time or energy right now to think about you or worry about your ego. You're just going to have to deal.  Women, your men are dead tired. They've just spent nine months watching you transform into someone they don't know, and they don't know what to do about it. They want to help you, they really do. But they've never even held a baby before, let alone having had to see to one's every need.  They're afraid to take the initiative and do something because they know you're going to yell them out for not doing it the way that you wanted them to. It's not out of laziness that they're waiting for you to tell them what to do. You've got to realize they've just become parents, too, and they're torn between feeling helpless and wanting to take action. It's not surprising they get stuck somewhere in the middle. You're just going to have to deal.

      OK, this is my official I'm a bad wife day. Today is my husband's birthday and I FORGOT!!! But before I get too absorbed in my self-flagellation, I'll preface all this by telling you he forgot my birthday last year. I guess this is what happens when you've been married ten years. So, I'll have to stop by the store tonight to get him a cake and card. I'll take him out to dinner, too. Other than that, it's just another day.   Finally managed to get Jeanine on her way. They closed Chicago last night because of a thunderstorm, so she had to stay another night to catch the next flight out this morning. C'est la vie. It was great getting to see her and Michelle again. It was like no time had passed since we sat at lunch talking trash about everyone else in the world. Sigh. Good memories.  I still can't believe I forgot my husband's birthday. That's pretty bad. Cool, Kate Bush is playing.   Sometimes I really wonder about this whole aging thing. In my mind I still feel 16. I feel like I should still be able to run around like a fool. Not really thinking about more than a good time.  If I were a rock star, I could still live that life. What's the quick path to rock stardom? If anyone out there has the answer, let me know. But I wouldn't be a Janis Joplin rock star. I don't want to die. And how cliche is that anyway? Let me drink myself to death and let them all find me in a pool of vomit and shit-filled undies. So glamorous. I've always wondered why rock stars drink and drug so much. Most people are doing these things because they want to escape their real lives. Let's think about rock stars: you're rich, you're famous, you can have sex with anyone you want. What reality are you trying to escape? Yeah, man. You've got it bad. Life's just not fair, is it? Doesn't make a lick of sense to me.   I saw this documentary on HBO the other day about how bad the meth problem is in rural areas of the country. It's apparently the drug of choice for Farmer Bob and his cronies. What I couldn't believe is that they showed this couple shooting up in their kitchen. So the guy is melting the meth in the spoon to shoot up and he sucks that crap into the syringe and it's dirty. I mean it's brown and there are pieces of dirt floating around inside the needle and they shoot this into their veins. Why not just mix up some mud and shoot up on that? It was really disgusting. I guess that just goes to show how bad addictions can be.

      I know it's been awhile, but I've got a very special interview today. It's my friend Jeanine and we used to work together at the American Nurses Association. She, Michelle and I were the cultural diversity squad at ANA. So, let's get the interview going.  KC: Tell me your worst nightmare.  JWG: It's a toss-up between drowning or dying from fire.  KC: Why those two things?  JWG: Because I'm a good swimmer and I've always thought how could you not swim away if you're in trouble, and I worked for a lawyer once who worked on an arson case and I saw pictures of the people killed in the fire and I thought just shoot me but don't let me fry like that.  KC: What has been your impression of the Midwest on this visit?  JWG: The intellectual midwest I just saw or what I think of South Bend and Mishawaka. Ha, ha, ha. No really, it strikes me as being so southern in many ways in that everyone is nice and the pace is so slow--probably out of fear--and finally she said isn't the weather so nice. But, it just strikes me as the outskirts of Savannah and you can see these people with their denim and dixieland flags. But it's funny because it doesn't seem like Notre Dame belongs here because you walk around and it's nice and sunny but you feel like people are talking about more than how high the corn is growing.  KC: I should give our viewers some background information on you. Jeanine is a graduate of Mount Holyoke College. She received her degree in Politics because at Mount Holyoke they believe it's an art as well as a science. She currently works in Northern Virginia a communications professional. Also, she's very funny and she's from Savannah, GA. So she's a Georgia Peach.  What's been the weirdest thing about being married in your opinion?  JWG: I think the absolute weirdest thing is people calling me Mrs. (Name). I still haven't gotten used to that.  KC: Who are you voting for?  JWG: Not a Bush fan, but I'm also not a Kerry fan. So, I'm just waiting for someone to surprise me or make me feel good about them before it's time to vote, I believe this is the first year where I cannot honestly say, "Yeah, that's the one." Neither one does it for me.  KC: What is the most dangerous aspect of people's silent racism in America today?  JWG: Well, it's hard to fight something that you can't see so in many instances the person who is silent may be the very person you desperately want something from or need something from. But if they're racist, you can't get it and you're doing what you can to make yourself the best candidate for a job, making a bid on a house, getting an approval for a loan. And it's incredible the many ways racism can affect your life. But of course you don't have to succumb to that.  KC: What's been the most disturbing thing that ever happened to you because of your race?  JWG: I think the most disturbing thing is the first thing I can ever remember happening and that was riding down the street on my bike with my girlfriend--who was white--and having these teenage boys call me nigger.  KC: How old were you?  JWG: We were in second grade. And it's almost like when you've never been called a name like that before, the impact is so great when someone actually opens their lips to call you that because you're just in shock. In some ways, I'm glad it happened in second grade because it prepared me for life. I'm sure there are worse things people could do than call me a name, but it sets you up to be prepared for the next thing.  KC: What did do? Did you just tell your parents? Did you say anything to the boys?  JWG: No. Actually, I just kept on riding and I never said a word to the boys or my parents. In fact, I don't even remember talking about it with my friend.  KC: Was it out of shame that you kept quiet?  JWG: Possibly. I never really thought about why I never said anything. Living in my neighborhood wasn't easy. Going to my school wasn't easy. I was litterally one of a handful of black people. I didn't want to make it harder on my parents to live there. If they knew people were calling me names, they would've moved. Probably ego had something to do with it because I thought you can't just make me leave by calling me a name.  KC: I think it's interesting to see the level of racism that exists just within the black community itself. I suppose it exists somewhat within white cultre but is seems really pervasive among African-Americans in terms of light-skinned vs. dark-skinned. What's that all about?  JWG: I'm sure it's not any more pervasive in African-American communities as other communities. I once knew a guy who was half Italian and half Brazillan or Portugese, and he's mother was devasted that he'd never marry a full-blooded Italian because she had made him so dark since she was from another culture.  KC: Why would she care if he married a full-blooded Italian.  JWG: I don't know. Her husband was full Italian and they lived in a full Italian town. It was the craziest thing I ever heard. But I do think that in this country, I mean there is such a stigma about being dark over things like where your ancestor worked, whether it was in the big house or outside. And also if you wanted to succeed in America if you were a very light-skinned person you could do that by just denying your African heritage and marrying a white person and fil into the main culture, which gives you access to so many things.  KC: But to continue in that line of thinking doesn't even seem logical anymore.  JWG: True, but it's only been less than two hundred years. To us that sounds like a long time but it's not in the whole scheme of things.  KC: OK, now that you've read some of my past interviews, you're going to have to give up something nasty from your past.  JWG: No way. I am a very prim and proper woman and I don't have anything nasty in my past, At least I'm not dumb enough to let you put it on your blog. I don't have any crazy stuff. I should have hung out with Michael. I kidnapped a man once.  KC: What?1?  JWG: It's not that exciting a story.  KC: It's story, though, right?  JWG: Let me see, I kidnapped someone...I can't tell you about Chris and the gay people, he'll kill me. Dating the three guys, that wasn't that exciting. I'm just boring. I'm everyone's goody-two-shoes friend. Everyone has kids now, I'm still trying to live it up.  KC: I want to know about Chris and the gay people.  JWG: I can't reveal that unless we're divorced.  KC: Pleeeeease. (I'm looking with puppy-dog eyes.)  JWG: I can't.  KC: OK, I guess I'll have to be satisfied with the kidnapping story.  JWG: No, I'm going to think of a really good story and do it via e-mail. (Starts laughing really hard.) My girlfriend Kim and I used to drive by Chris' house and pretend we're were mailing stuff, just so we could look at his house. Only Kim will find this funny.  KC: OK, I'll take your word on that.  JWG: I guess I'll have to start a blog just so I can interview you.  KC: OK, we're going to cut out now because Jeanine is hooked by the blog bug and we're going to get her started with her own. See you later.

      Well, Thelma and Louise if they had a six-year-old and a bag of gummi bears with them. The trip to Kentucky was great fun. Michelle and Bennett's babies are sooooo cute. Go here if you want to see them  urlLink Michelle & Bennett's website . They were about six weeks premature, which is not unusual for twins or multiples in general. It's been a long road to parenthood for them and I am so happy everything has worked out.

      Well, I must say I am feeling tres excited today. My good friend Jeanine flies in tomorrow morning from DC, and we will then be heading down to Kentucky to visit our other good friend Michelle. Michelle (the Michelle I interviewed some posts back) just had twin girls and we're on the way to see them.  It'll be great to see everyone, but it will also be great to see someplace new. I've never been to Louisville, so it's a little mini-adventure for me, as well. However, road tripping today is a little different than it used to be. We will be taking the child, so no beer. Sob, sob. But seriously, I certainly don't condone drinking and driving. It's a joke, people. Chill out. I haven't seen Jeanine since her wedding about three or four years ago. It'll be so much fun.   My husband has to get his pupils dialated for his yearly diabetes-related eye exam. He wanted me to go with him to drive back home afterwards, but he realized he could probably handle it on his own. I will, however, have to figure out ways to mess with him tonight since his vision will be all screwed up. Maybe I'll purposefully shove things in his face like they do with 3D movies. I don't know that that will actually do anything, but it'll be fun experimenting nonetheless.

      Here we are in Littlerock, WA visiting my husband's highschool friend Bret and his wife Debbie. We had a great time today at the Thurston county fair. We saw lots of farm animals and that's  always  a treat, if you know what I mean. Then we came back to the house and had bangers and mash. (Debbie is English.)  KC: Debbie, how has Tim lived up to your expectation of him?  DR: I haven't thought about my expectations.  BR: You've had no expectations so he's down wonderfully?  DR: Yeah, he's alright.  KC: Brett, what is the most embarrassing thing you've ever seen Tim do?  TM: If we were walking about Darrell it would be easier?  BR: The only thing I can think of isn't very funny. It's when we put a "kick me, I'm a pinko" on Bill G.  KC: Is anyone interested in making any sort of political statement:?  All: No.  KC: Anything anyone's wanted to get off their chest?  All: No.  KC: Come on, surely somebody's got something bothering them?  BR: I'm afraid we're really quite boring people.  KC: OK, this is a bust. I'll have to try and figure something else out.
