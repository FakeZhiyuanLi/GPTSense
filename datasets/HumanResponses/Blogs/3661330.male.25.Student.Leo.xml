      Lets see, what to write- feel like writing, but don't have anything specific in mind. So I'm just going to write whatever comes to my head in a kind of stream of consciousness method- lets see where to begin, I need some sex, need it bad. But I'm trying to be faithful to my girlfriend who is out of town. She is always out of town, working, which leaves me all alone in town working and going to school all by my lonesome. I'm glad I'm a little older now or otherwise I would have probably cheated on her many many times by now. In a town like this, you don't have to travel far to find good looking women. My old self would have given in a long time ago to temptation and everything in between. But I'm trying, I'm really trying to look beyond the madness and to not give in to meaningless sex. Meaningless? Meaningless to whom? It would be pretty goddamn meaningful to me, but I guess no one would ask me when it came down to a question of fidelity. So its me and my girlfriend's cat, all alone every night, me studying, my cat batting at me, fighting for attention. If only my girlfriend craved attention from me like my furry friend. Some people tell me to let those old school desires of promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners go and revel in my relationship- but its hard sometimes to see the bigger picture with all these little girlies runnin' around looking all good and your girlfriend is miles away, oblivious to the entire scene. Besides for me, at this point in my life I'm not completely invested in settling down- its much more interesting to meet different women every night, let things lead where they may and never get serious- but don't get me wrong, its also nice to have the things that couples have together beyond the sexual realm.

      There is this girl that I work with who has it in her mind that I despise her and that I don't "get" the real her. The truth is, if I despised her, I wouldn't waste my time writing some stupid ass commentary about her on a webpage that will never get read. This is for her and her alone and yes she is the girl that inspired me to create this page.   But unlike her, I don't want to just kiss her- it could never only go that far with me. But what about her mixed signals, her psuedo lover, etc? Is all of that just a show or do feelings and attractions overpower her will to practice fidelity?   True, she did kiss me once, after knowing me for a total of 3 hours- and she was extremely drunk and tried to play it off the next day at work- but she seems to believe there is a mystery about me, when in truth, the only mystery about me is that I'm the one guy she has wanted to "discover" that she hasn't discovered. She isn't used to not having what she wants- especially with guys. So the attraction she bears is simply uncharted territory- unknown waters if you will. If I was to submit, practice my old ways of infidelity, and give in to my office space desires, once she had me, there would be no more mystery. She wouldn't ponder the inner workings of me. She wouldn't care. She would have taken what she wanted from me, found that I wasn't that big a deal to begin with, and laughed at herself for wasting so much energy concerning herself with me.   But its true, I would like to discover her.

      I always had a feeling that the aforementioned coworker who inspired me to start one of these, and I were completely different people with completely different backgrounds, but I never fully realized until tonight how incredibly different we actually are. Its funny, her background and mine, her upbringing and mine contrast greatly as do our values. Our ideas of success and what we want out of life clash as do what we find important. Strangely, I sense in her a quiet rebellion against this upbringing. On one hand it is completely a part of her. But on the other, I can feel her changing, growing, learning about what life is all about. She has found love when she used to run from it. She has grown to love this town when she used to talk down about it. Hell, her writing is filled with utilitarian viewpoints and perspectives, yet she refuses to admit that life isn't about BMWs, cosmopolitans, pradas, and a rich sugardaddy. I'm embarrassed that I could name prada. Truth be told, this mysterious woman is in love with a regular Joe who seems to be, not of her bloodline, but I could be mistaken. The overwhelming irony of this girl's perspective is that she works beside and rooms with a man that would match her every snobbish demand in life. He shares the same vision and perversely twisted ideals about what life is all about, as well as he people in it. She sees this deep down. He does not. But if it truly is this kind of complete isolation from everything that represents middle America on down, that she seeks, why wouldn't she snatch this guy up? She would say its all about attraction, or the lack thereof. I'd like to think she halfway realizes there is a larger picture out there, because as much of a cliche as it is, money can't buy happiness. Now, I wouldn't mind givin it a shot for a while because I'm certain money could alleviate some problems, but its not what one, in my humble opinion, should wrap their minds and lifestyles around.

      I must confess, I was inspired by a fellow co-worker who may or may not ever know that she did so, to create one of these things... the trouble is I'm not sure why? Who will read this? Why would they want to? Is this something that is strictly created so others can get a kick out of seeing their name in print on the internet- and the possibility that others might actually read this bullshit? Or maybe its the voyeur in us- maybe its the idea that we are gazing into something deeply personal to someone and that we might learn something private about them or about ourselves. Anyway- I'm just trying this shit out- seeing what its all about. Perhaps I'm even hoping that my coworker will read this and know its me- maybe she'll gaze into my world as I have gazed into hers and maybe she'll understand me. Maybe that is what this is all about? Understanding- or being understood. Whats the difference?
