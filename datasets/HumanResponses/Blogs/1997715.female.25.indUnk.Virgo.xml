       (Currently listening to: The Psychedelic Furs' "All Of This And Nothing" on vinyl)  A bunch of my friends are currently infatuated with this site called  urlLink Friendster .  Personally, while I may seem like a friendly, outgoing person,  urlLink Introvertster  is a little more my speed.  I know too many people already, and...okay, this is going to sound stupid and horrible, but I'm not a bad-looking person, and the last thing I need is peope who happen to know some friend of a friend of a friend trying to hook up with me.  I spent my teenage years trying to avoid male attention as much as possible.  But...okay, I caved to peer pressure and signed up.  I'm sure everybody will be tired of it by Saturday anyway.  The Mini-Con Road Assault Team really need to be girls.  They're so GIRLY.  When Energon Arcee comes out, I'm giving them to her.  All my friends are talking about Final Fantasy Tactics Advance right now, and it's making me sad that I haven't gotten it yet.  I'm so behind on GBA and GameCube games that it's not even funny.  If anybody is reading this really wants a good fan-art site to click around on, go to  urlLink WaraWarabi's site .  It's in Japanese and hasn't been updated for a month, but it's love.

       Today was nice.  To start with, I had the day off.  Now, I do really like my job, but no matter how much you love what you do for a living, a day off is always better than a day at work.  I slept in later than I meant, but that's okay.  After some sitting around listening to some of my new records, I burned a mix CD and walked up to Target.  I love that I can just walk to things here, though Target's about my limit for a casual walk at right around 2 miles from my apartment.  It was a bit chilly.  Autumn is definitely here.  It was just a really pleasant walk, culminating in me finding a good purse that I really like on heavy clearance.  And later Graham and I met up with Steve-o at Walky's and had a bit of an Armada marathon to get Steve caught up.  Steve-o is the only one who likes mushrooms on his pizza.  There was a young, stray black cat near Walky's apartment, but Graham says we can't have another cat.  I've just been feeling generally good about life lately.  It's like I've reached this point that I would never have imagined I could ever reach, but it's still not an unreasonable extrapolation of where my life has been headed all along.  There are things I've been involved with that still make me just stop and be amazed by it all.  I guess I don't see myself in the role that I've fallen into yet.  It'll take time.

       I feel sorry for anybody who has been skipping Armada.  There were a lot of seriously lame moments, but the end is really turning into a payoff, and it's a payoff that can't be fully understood unless you slogged through the 40-some preceeding episodes.  My cat is completely insane.  Not even in a normal cat way.  So work...  I really wonder about my job.  We get some real weirdos.  I'm not saying that our customer base is horrible.  The vast majority of our customers are perfectly good people, even the ones who couldn't figure out on their own that their 20-year collection of Better Homes & Gardens isn't actually worth money.  But then we get people like the guy last night.  I was standing at the counter cleaning off some grubby books before pricing them, and the guy comes up and notices one of our box cutters lying on the counter a couple feet from me.  He didn't look like a vagrant or anything, which most of the loonies we get in tend to, he looked like a 20-ish boy who devoted far too much of his time to looking hiply dishevelled.  He picked up the box cutter and stared at it with the rapture of someone who absolutely by no means should have a knife.  He was shaking, and when he spoke he stuttered.  What he said was a stuttery rendition of "Somebody left their knife here...".  I figured he was just messing with me, so, barely looking up, I replied matter-of-factly with "That's one of our box cutters."  He stuttered something about putting it with the boxes, but just kept clutching it and staring at it and shaking.  So I took it out of his hand and dropped it into the cup behind the counter.  He kept staring at his empty hand for a moment, then he proceeded to just sorta mope aroudn the store.  Like I said, I thought he was just some punk kid messing with me, but as I noticed him around the store I realized he was clearly on some high-grade drugs.  And I had just matter-of-factly swiped a razor out of his hands as though I had seen this all before.  I can step back and see this as some funny bit from a movie, a movie about a record store or, hey, a book store with a side-character so deadpan and jaded that she can just disarm a threatening guy without really looking up from her work.  I don't like to think I've become that character, but I suppose I'm getting awful good at dealing with the really freaky customers.  Though most of them don't play with the razor blades.  I'll probably be back with more later today.  My schedule doesn't fit well into normal dates.

       I have a very interesting story to share regarding my workplace, but I will have to share it later.  Walky has new Armada episodes and there's a new Big O tonight.  Check back later to hear about how I cleverly disarmed a knife-wielding junkie!

       I totally got a cell phone.   I did. I totally got a cell phone. It's one of those pre-paid deals, so I'm not going to put the number up here because I don't want people calling me all the time for no reason. It's with Virgin Mobile, because I figure, if I'm going to be blowing my cash on something intangible like "cell phone service", I would rather be giving it to someone like Popular Transformers UK Guest Star Richard Branson. I adore Richard Branson. I'm sorry, SIR Richard Branson, because even the royalty knows he rocks. And the extra faceplate was even that iridescent blue-purple color that changes with the angle of the light. And one of the downloadable ringtones was the Invader ZIM theme. This was made for me.  "Dash" is an exceedingly excellent episode of Armada. I will not spoil, I will just say it was excellent.

       If I write it, will they come?   So I've decided to start a blog. Why, you might ask? Because I need to write, and there's so much going on in my life lately that I'm having trouble concentrating well enough to get a proper story down. My life is full of amazing shit right now, and that, I think, is my problem. All my good fiction comes when I'm angsty as hell and needing to project or escape or what have you. But I still need to write. So I will blog, just to make the words happen. And maybe, just maybe, someone will read it. That'd be pretty cool.  Goodbye for now!

        urlLink This article on CNN.com  is the best thing ever.  So it's Halloween.  I love Halloween.  It's, like, my favorite holiday in the world.  I like the idea of Christmas and its related trappings, and I love getting presents for people, but I can only really appreciate it when I seperate everything I like about it from the childhood angst I have surrounding it.  Well, more teen angst - my parents didn't get to the "We don't care what you want, we'll get you whatever makes us feel like we're good parents" stage until my teen years.  Halloween is just great and wonderful.  The down side is that I forgot to ask for the night off of work, so I have to close tonight, naturally.  Leaving it up to chance that I should be able to have an early shift today was apparently foolish.  I suppose it only matters so much, because our apartment doesn't actually get trick-or-treaters.  Nobody in the building has children, and no children from the neighborhood nearby want to come all the way over here and, in my case, up three floors for candy that's probably not even as good as the candy in the way-too-nice houses in their own neighborhood.   So I wouldn't get to give out candy anyway, but I won't get to have Halloween fun with Graham.  I'm dressing up a little for work, though.  I was thinking I wanted to do a Zaranna costume this year, but at work that'd probably get a little unwieldy, and nobody would know who I was anyway.  I kinda wanted to get a Cobra shirt to wear as part of it, so I wouldn't just look like a generic pink-haired punk, but Hot Topic didn't have any.  Bleh.  So I got some cat ears and a new tail to wear with my normal clothes at work.  At least I'll be dressed up.

       I had to come home from work to take my cat to the vet today.  She's been acting weird all week - lots of using the bathroom where she isn't supposed to, which has never been a problem before.  I mean, she's old and senile and she kinda misses on occasion, which is why I keep her box in the bathroom on the tile floor, but we're talking not even in the same room.  And today I had been at work for less than an hour when Graham calls me to tell me she's started pissing blood.  Scared me shitless.  And on a Sunday, who's open?  Fortunately, the OSU vet department has an emergency clinic.  So I came home, we took her in, and after a few hours in the waiting room we find out that she's likely just got a urinary tract infection.  It was an emergency, what with the blood and uncontrollable pissing and all, but fortunately it doesn't seem to be anything life-threatening.  The vet also said that she has a heart murmur and lung fibrosis, which is bad, but not unusual in a cat her age.  I don't know if I want to worry about having her treated for the heart murmur, not at her age.  I love her, but I care more about the quality of her life than the quantity, and I don't want her to live two years longer if those two years have to be spent recovering from painful surgeries and treatments.  If she were young it would be different, but she's had a long life and that's just the sort of thing that makes for a quiet, natural death.  But it's still not completely over.  The vet also found some cells in her urine from the tissue that makes up the bladder walls.  Well, more of the cells than normal.  He said this could just be the result of the tissue sloughing off because of the infection, but there's a chance she could have a tumor there.  And that would be bad.  It could be cancerous, and that definitely falls into the category of things I don't want her to have to suffer through.  Something like that would definitely mean a choice, and soon, between putting her to sleep and painful therapy.  I really hope it's jsut the infection.  So that's my day for you.  How was yours? ;)

       I finally found some of these Bubble Twist candy-with-a-little-toy things at Toys R Us today.  I am a big fan of the candy toy.  I will occasionally embarass myself by being the only gaijin the in Japanese grocery just so I can find and purchase tiny rubber Pokemon and Gundams that come with highly questionable candy that tastes not unlike an unholy mint/lemon hybrid.  So I figured these Bubble Twist things would be cool.  And they are pretty cool, though my Blind-Packed Toy Karma failed to get Walky the Hot Shot he so dearly wanted.  But one thing hurts my head: I'm looking at the label, and it says, "Gum made and packaged in Spain.  Toy made and packaged in China."  That's all well and good, except...THEY'RE IN THE SAME PACKAGE!  Gyah.  I've started reading some of my Titan TF collections.  I haven't really bothered with reading them as I got them, because it's all stuff I've read so many times that I just know it.  But I've decided that it's been too long.  I was actually reading "Primal Scream" and "Matrix Quest" on the flight back from Alabama.  I need to rewatch TF:TM, too, because it's been way too long since I sat down and watched that, and for the same reason.  I hijacked Walky's DVD player to watch "Key to Vector Sigma" today.  I love the Aerialbots.

       I want to sleep.  I hate sinus headache medicine.  All that stuff that says "Non-Drowsy" is a total lie.  I've used Tylenol Sinus Daytime Formula as sleeping pills before.  I think at this point I'm mostly blogging to keep myself awake.  I really like the G1 episode "Dark Awakening".  It seems to be a big topic of discussion on ATT right now, probably because it's on the most recently-released Rhino DVD set.  I need to pick up that set, but since it's the week just before I get paid, I'm broke.  That tends to happen.  We get paid every other week, and one of my co-workers asked on an off week whether it was payday or not.  Justin and I instantly replied that it wasn't; if you ever wanna know if it's payday, ask the people who spend way too much money on shit like video games and are therefore always broke.  So as I was saying, I really love that episode.  It's one of the few episodes that I still remembered clearly after the show had been off the air a few years.  (Hey, when I was 8 I didn't quite have the memory for that stuff I do now.)  I always, always thought Prime was the greatest thing ever, and it was wrenching to see him like that - brought back to life, used as a puppet to hurt his own troops, and then torn apart in the end.  And when it first aired you didn't get that "Prime is okay, kids!  Tune in next week for Beast Wars Second!" bullshit.  He was DEAD, having sacrificed himself to save his own Autobots.  Maybe it's like Walky said way back in one of his comic collections about "Titanic" being when he realized it was interesting to hurt your characters in order to get an emotional response from your readers.  I think "Dark Awakening" did that for me a decade earlier.  I don't fault Marv Wolfman or anybody else involved for bringing him back and negating some of that.  If you believe the urban legends, it was public opinion that made the decision.  I would go so far as to say there wasn't much choice, because kids really weren't ready for that.  I fully admit I was a morbid, depressive little child, and where I was facinated by the angst I felt at watching all that and having Prime die in the first place, I'm sure it probably legitimately upset some kids.  I was going to write another paragraph about something, but I don't remember what it was now.  Damn medicine.  Maybe it was my pants.  Oh, I remember.  I guess it's still on the subject.  All this fuss over Anniversary Prime and  urlLink his removable mouthplate  has inspired me.  At first I thought it was kinda scary and wanted to keep the thing on, but now I realize what I'd really love to do is customize an Extreme Battle Damage Prime.  A Dremel tool, an airbrush, and a bunch of random wires and I could do a seriously neat custom.  I could melt half his mouthplate, maybe have one of his arms torn off with wires hanging out of the stump, a couple big torso gashes, maybe even one through his chest that would show the Matrix inside.  Not a dead Prime, an Ass-Kicked-But-Still-Fighting Prime.  It's a pity it'd run me $75 just for an extra toy to do it to, but if I got some spare cash I'd definitely give it a shot.  I really wanna do this now.  Snippet of #wiigii! goodness for today:   Someone outside has FAQ written in their window in the dirt.  Either they can't spell fag or that Dodge is a source of Frequently Asked Questions.

       FLCL is so interesting.  On the surface it's like the end result of spending two weeks without sleep reading Tank Girl comics while listening to J-punk.  It's strange and makes a point of being nonsensical, and then it's got these very earnest elements.  It's far too much like being 13 again.  It's achingly reminiscent of that age when you want to be as un-innocent as possible and nothing actually makes sense.  It makes a point of reminding you of how horribly stupid and ordinary things seemed, even when they weren't.  I don't think I could watch the whole series straight.  It would give me a headache and a killer sense of guilt.

       While Mike Allred's art does not exactly evoke Rob Zomble for me, I can't help but get a chuckle when "Living Dead Girl" comes on the radio.  Today was my first day at work after the vacation (I say "the vacation" in the same way one would say "the loss", as though to distance myself from some great tragedy.  I don't know why I do this.), and I was immediately reminded of my love for my job when I was greeted by not only an excellent Brave Series art/story/guidebook thing of the sort that tend to accompany anime series, but also a set of GI Joe young adult novels that included the one written by popular sell-out R.L. Stine.  Any author who would write not one, but two books about an actual roller coaster presumably entirely because the owners of the theme park paid him to is quality kitch by my standards.  He also wrote the immensely popular for two weeks "Goosebumps" series, for those who have never worked at a book shop, and an impressive number of exactly the sort of young adult horror novels that I skipped over entirely in favor of Stephen King.  I was thrilled to death, especially with the Brave book.  I spent most of the day giddy over the character sheets for my beloved Ryujin, who I swear I will someday make into the Autobot soldiers they deserve to be.

       I'm back.  I didn't post much from Alabama not because I never had time, but because I was informed after the first day that my father's cheap-ass step-father who owns the lakehouse we were staying at had the phone set up to charge by the minute, because then he got a cheaper base rate.  So I didn't get to use the internet much, even though I had a good bit of down-time.  I'm glad I went, though.  The lakehouse was a 45-minute drive from town, so I spent a lot of time in the back of X-Brawn spending quality time with my GBASP.  But all told, I'm really glad I went.  It wasn't as bad as I feared.  There was a lot of family drama, primarily revolving around my aforementioned cousin, but we all got along really well.  I felt like the crazy aunt to all my cousins' children - I'm the only one from that generation who doesn't have any, I think.  I guess the problem was that living in Michigan's U.P. gave me a really bad impression of people.  I was used to people who had children early using it as an excuse to just live off the government the rest of their lives, like so many of the people up there seemed to do.  It was just kind of disgusting, how many people you'd see who hadn't bathed for days spending as much on beer as they were on the stuff their food stamps covered.  But Alabama wasn't like that.  You got yourself a job and some land and a house and just had a family, no matter what age you started it at.  I'm happy to see how well my cousin Bubba's doing, considering his immediate family was pretty screwed up.  His sister is the one with the horrid husband, but unlike her he realized at some point that his immediate family wasn't normal and proceeded to do things the way he thought was right.  He's got a great family and drives a logging truck, which I'm sure pays more than what I'm doing right now and, much like what I'm doing right now, gives him experience to do something better down the line.  And he just seems really happy.  He sees the problems his parents had growing up and sees them AS problems.  There are a whole lot of people in this world who don't have the sense to do that, and I think that just goes back to my old rant on self-help books.  He's really got his shit together.  Hopefully his sister can get her own shit together, since she's looking to my mother a lot these days.  I think I feel a lot better in a way I didn't realize by going down there and seeing everybody again.  And it was fun being the crazy aunt to all my cousins' kids.  Every kid needs a crazy aunt.  I'm gonna go hit some Wal-Marts now.  I had a fun trip to the zoo today that was cut tragically short by a major sinus headache, so I need to get some fresh air again.  Whee!

       My parents bought X-Brawn, complete with the chrome grill guard and sideboards.  *sob*  So here I am, in the South.  I wrote a big long thing in my notebook while I was sitting around Port Columbus airport waiting for the flight I arrived way too early for, but I don't have it in me to type it up.  I did get to spend a good couple hours of my evening in the emergency room, because on the way to pick me up in Atlanta my mother developed a bad allergic reaction to something, possibly something in the seat material of her new X-BRAWN.  By the time we got back to Opelika she was feeling really awful, so we took her to the hospital.  I guess it was probably for the best, since our original plans had involved having dinner with a group of relatives that might have included my cousin's horrid wife-beating almost-ex husband, who she has apparently decided to make amends with despite the fact that he kicked her in the head in front of her toddler son.  When I was a teenager, I used to fantasize about becoming some kind of feminist vigilante.  If it had been out at the time, I would have probably just wanted to be Astro City's Winged Victory.  This definitely makes me want to revisit those thoughts.  I love airports.  I found myself spending far too much time as I was travelling thinking about myself, who I was now compared to who I was as a child or who I was compared to my sister.  I'm really hard to pin down now.  I even have trouble describing me.  I think maybe there's a big difference between who I am and who I, for some reason, want to be, so I end up acting both the way I really am and the way I think I should be, and sometimes they conflict.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.  Change is good.  But this is supposed to be a vacation, not a time to get all weird and introspective.  Travelling alone just gives me way too much time to think.  I  want Alternators Smokescreen to come out already.

       Ugh...  Tummy hurts...  Too much...pizza...  I really like the Big O.  It's a good show, and I like smart-ass deadpan androids.  The second season is really weird, though.  It's not a bad weird.  The difference between the first and second seasons is like the difference between the episodes of the X-Files where they're chasing chupacabra through the woods and the episodes where people are taking alien implants out of Scully's head.  The first was more fun, but the second was more interesting.  I've been spending the day slowly packing and tidying up the apartment in preparation for my trip to Alabama tomorrow, with a brief break to gorge myself at Pizza Hut.  I set up all the Armada Autobots and Mini-Cons on my desk.  I have a shitload of Mini-Cons.  I mean, dude, that's a lot of Mini-Cons.  I wanted to take a picture, but I couldn't get my lame cheap-o camera to work with my new computer.  I'm not a big brag-about-my-collection person, but it's a fucking sea of Mini-Cons.  I have three Sparkplugs.  I've got FOUR of the Air Defense Team.  I need the rest of the X-Dimension sets.  I need to count these suckers.  It's a hell of a lot for someone who's not actually a completist.  On the subject of Armada, I still want to write my own take on it, and now that I have a feedback forum thing I want people to tell me what they think of that while I'm gone.  Like I said, I just thought up too much stuff while I was waiting for the canon to sort itself out, and now that I've been considering getting all that on paper I have even more ideas.  Just go post me something.  I'll have some computer access while I'm gone, but probably not much, so don't expect me to definitely post.  I'm sure I'll have some killer stories when I get back.  Woo, ATV riding!

       I'll get to the game talk in a moment, but first: Transfandom.com just put up an interview with Simon Furman and (inexplicably) Brad Mick about the upcoming shift from Armada to Energon, go read it  urlLink here .  There's one little thing I wanted to comment on:  TFD: Word on the street is that Energon pays homage to a great deal of characters from previous lines... and with names like Scorponok it is obvious that some notice was paid to older Transformers work. What kind of inspiration are you taking from previous generations of Transformers? SF: I'm actually looking back at what I've done in the past (on previous TF Generations) and basically throwing out the rulebook for Energon. Previously, there was a maximum damage threshold for planet Earth, a kind of 'that's going too far'. With 10 years' worth of breathing space between Armada and Energon, that no longer seems to apply. The basic status quo is going to be very different, and what happens after that is anyone's guess!  This is coming from a guy who had San Francisco - in what was then the present day, not even this future stuff - completely destroyed not as a major plot point, but as a villian's off-the-cuff demonstration of force.  I'm amost afraid to see what he's got planned for Energon.  So portable gaming...  I bring this up now because of this week's release of the  urlLink N-Gage , which any good gamer and/or  urlLink Penny Arcade  reader will have noticed being met with derisive giggling.  I myself ran out of Electronics Botique in a giggle-fit when I noticed on my way out that they actually had some demo models.  I'll pick on it first both since it's out and since it's an easy target.  The first problem is that it's far too ambitious.  It's not only a gaming unit, it's also a cell phone, an mp3 player, and an FM radio.  The next problem is, at $300, it's more expensive than all four devices put together.  In addition, it doesn't even do at least two of those functions particularly well.  The phone function requires you to hold the device awkwardly, and to top it off you look like you've been in a horrible frisbee accident.  And gaming...I put aside my giggling long enough to fiddle with the demo at Target, and the use of the numerical phone keypad for games was ridiculous.  They had the Tomb Raider game loaded up, and each of the number buttons pulled off a seperate action.  The hell!?  Could it be any more confusing?  And if a game only uses a couple of the buttons, how do you remember which ones?  It's as counter-intuitive as it could possibly be.   urlLink Sony's PSP  may seem a little more promising at first, but there are some aspects of it that make me seriously question Sony's ability to understand the portable gaming market.  To start with, I think the most telling stat here is the size.  With a 4.5" screen, the PSP will have to be significantly larger than any Game Boy incarnation.  The size of the original Game Boy is considered one of the signs of its obsolescence, and one of the biggest selling points of the Game Boy Advance SP is how compact it is.  Backwards compatability is a major feature of both Sony's PS2 and the GBA, but the PSP's new media format won't allow for that.  Processing specs like the ones planned for the PSP will guarantee a hefty price tag, at least at first.  With a lack of backwards compatability, a high price tag, and a not-quite-portable size, people are likely to get the "portable" PS1 kits that come with a power pack and a screen so they'll at least be able to play all the games already available for that system before they buy a PSP.  The inclusion of an analog stick seems like a promise of broken systems, especially from a company that doesn't have a very good track record when it comes to durability.  The problem inherent in the PSP is that Sony doesn't understand portable gamers.  We want small, and we'll sacrifice graphics to get it.  In fact, a lot of Game Boy enthusiasts specifically enjoy old-fashioned side-scrollers and turn-based RPGs.  We like substance over style.  If Sony puts too much emphasis on style, they're not going to win over Game Boy fans, and Game Boy fans ARE the portable market.  I like a game console I can keep in my purse, and I'm more than content with the GBA's graphics capabilities.  Golden Sun was a beautiful game, and it didn't need everything to be polygons to pull it off.  Pokemon Sapphire spent the effort and memory space they could have used on overly complex graphics on amazingly complex, deep gameplay.  And my purse isn't even that big.  I predict that the PSP will fare much, much better than the N-Gage because of the Playstation brand's built-in fanbase, but I don't see it toppling the Game Boy Advance.  There.  I'm glad I finally got around to getting that out of my system.

       I was going to write a long essay about portable gaming and how Nokia and Sony's portables will never succeed because of an inability to understand the portable gamer, but I have a headache and Teen Titans is on.  So maybe later tonight.

       There.  I've created a mirror site for this blog on LiveJournal so I can see if there would be any point to me having a comments function.  There's a link to it on the sidebar.  So if anything I've written has sparked a desperate need to comment, go on over and leave me a reply.  I'll be mirroring this site over there for the time being, until I've decided to either completely move or abandon the idea.

       I don't really have any big things to say tonight, so I'll just say some little things.  I got Corona Sparkplug today.  Yes, and Final Battle Prime, too.  I was thinking of putting them off, because Graham says if the big giftset that's coming out is just the same as the normal toys, I could have the one he already got, but it's really hard to tell what the Prime in the giftset will be.  And Kaybee's having their "We Got Sued!" sale in addition to a general TF sale, so he was about $26 and tax.  I'll likely never see him at that price again, and I didn't want to pass it up on the chance he doesn't end up with a spare.  I've been wanting to pick up Corona Sparkplug anyway.  He's all gold and chromey and magical.  I was already coming up with an origin for him in that Armada project I mentined the other day.  I think I may have to go through with it.  Ever since I started letting myself think about it as a stand-alone I've just been too inspired.  I need to get these ideas out or I'll go crazy.   urlLink This article  amuses me.  So this software company is going to sue this guy because he pointed out that their copy-protection software is easily thwarted?  Maybe they should have made software that didn't suck.  I might be moving this to LiveJournal, sad but true.  I've kinda been angsting for a Comments function, but I don't think I can manage the coding or hosting to pull it off on my own.  I'd be fun for my friends to be able to tell me I'm being angsty and boring before they stop reading entirely.

       I want to rewrite Armada.  It's not that I think the existing fiction is terrible and I think I could do  so  much better.  It's just that the concepts behind the series have really inspired me, and I've gotten lots of really neat ideas and explainations into my head that can't be properly absorbed into the existing fiction.  Like my dissertation on Leader-1 and Sparkplug from Saturday.  It's primarily things I've come up with while waiting for the fiction to get to the real answers, and now they've become solid enough that I want to follow through and write them down.  It'd be a huge project, and I'd have to worry, of course, not only about the characters I'm facinated by but also the ones that haven't sparked my imagination as much.  But it would be a bit like an exercise in discipline.  I'm sure I'll put it on the site, but maybe not with a lot of fanfare.  The idea of even doing my own take on a series seems a little presumptuous to me, so I'd feel self-conscious shoving it down everyone's throats.  I just want to get it out.  I'm sure I'll force it on my friends, though.  I think I'm going to make a mix CD entirely of songs that make me think of Mini-Cons.

       I like court shows.  They're a lot like talk shows, no doubt thanks to the producers picking really dysfunctional guests, but the host gets to yell at them and tell them they're horrible.  Also, I have learned a very important lesson from these shows: Never, under any circumstances, buy anybody a car.  I've gotten back to walking again.  And by "again", I mean this morning.  The seasonal change kind of threw off my schedule; I was walking at night during the summer to avoid the heat and intense sun, but now it's too cold.  I had been taking the occasional walk up to Target to make up for it, but now I'm back on my non-summer schedule.  Graham and I went to see 28 Days Later at the cheap theater last night.  For those who do not live near one of the miracles that are second-run theaters, they show movies that have been out for a couple months and the tickets are dirt cheap.  With the crazy prices of movie tickets around here right now, it's gotta be a pretty impressive movie for us not to wait for it to hit the second-run theater.  And it also means we see more movies in general.  How many movies aren't worth 50 cents-$1.50 (depending on the time and day of the week)?  28 Days Later was pretty good.  It maybe wasn't as scary as it seemed like it would be, but it was still a really good low budget-artsy zombie movie with some very cool directing.  I'd recommend it, unless you're some kinda squeamish horror-movie-phobe.  Next up will be either Finding Nemo or Freddy vs Jason, both of which just started there.  A friend of mine just relayed to our mailing list that the very excellent Ben Folds has been eschewing his record label in favor of releasing EPs directly from his site (that would be  urlLink www.benfolds.com .  I will definitely have to look into that when I have money again, and I would recommend that others do so as well.  With my recent re-acquisition of a cell phone, I have become facinated with  urlLink cell phone straps .  It's probably for the best that I don't have any money to spend right now, because if I did last night I would have probably blown it all on light-up charms of Mashimaru and Jack Skellington.  I'm not entirely certain why these haven't caught on here, since they seem to be popular everywhere else - though mostly Japan.  The thing is, I'm not 100% sure my new phone has a loop for one.  I guess I'd have to get out the Dremel and make one.  And I kinda want one for my Game Boy SP, too.  I like not having to open at work.

       I will be very happy when this stupid virus has run its course.  I'm sick of having all these virus-bearing e-mails clogging up my inbox with their bloated 145-155k selves.  I haven't  gotten  the virus, I'm just sick of the e-mails.  I'm going to Alabama in a week.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.  I have family down there.  Family that I haven't seen, for the most part, for something like 8 years.  Y'see, my immediate family lives in Washington, DC.  I decided I should probably go visit them sometime soon, because I haven't been there since Graham, Walky and I crashed at their place on the way back from pestering Glen at Wizard World East, and that was just for a night.  And they do have a new puppy, a miniature schnauzer named Peaches, who I also want to visit.  I am easily lured by offers of puppies, especially ones I don't have to clean up after.  So I called and asked my mom when I could come visit in October, and she said that they were going to Alabama for a week, and I  could  come along, they'd even fly me to Atlanta and pick me up.  My knee-jerk reaction was "Hell no!"  But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how sick I am of DC, and the more I realized that Alabama could be fun.  We'll be staying at my grandfather's lakehouse, my mom's got a laptop so I won't be totally disconnected, and there'll certainly be more to do than hanging out with the one friend I have left in DC.  I've been avoiding the place like the plague ever since I was old enough to get my parents to leave me behind when they went, but I think I'm enough of an adult to handle the culture shock.  I'm hoping I don't have to fend off too many questions from relatives about why I'm 25 and don't have any kids and haven't even been married once.  I guess that's what really bothers me, the idea that they won't know what to make of me.  I'm on the fringes of normal society, down there I'd be a total outcast.  But I'm sure I'll be okay.  I'm determined to go to the restaurant near the lakehouse that serves chocolate fritters.

       I don't understand the US Saint Seiya opening.  I'm really not the sort of person to whine and nit-pick over anime dubs, but...I mean, why is it just a montage under Bowling For Soup's cover of "I Ran"?  What's WRONG with them?  It's not that it's an insult to the original whatever, it just doesn't actually make sense.  And why is this guy a woman?  I posted something to the  urlLink Allspark  the other day that I really like, so I think I'll repost it here.  It was in a thread about the true leader of the Mini-Cons:  "I, being me, have naturally come up with a big theory regarding these guys and leadership of the Mini-Cons. (I'm also doing bios for both of them for a project, which helps.) I see it as a sort of Optimus/Rodimus thing. Leader-1 was their leader back on Cybertron, and he was really well-respected and everybody thought he was great. And he was great. He was a wise, compassionate leader. Which was why Megatron picked him as his personal pet. Sparkplug is just this guy at first (he wasn't actually a leader on Cybertron, he was shown more as, well, just this guy), but through being around Optimus I see him coming to realize he's sort of a "chosen one" (which I think is why he ended up with Optimus in the first place, because of a sort of subconscious recognition of this by both of them). He's a natural leader and has a great deal of concern and compassion for his fellow Mini-Cons, and he really has a lot of Autobot-leader qualities, but since he was always just this guy, he has a lot of self-doubt. I see him as having a heaping dose of good, old-fashioned, Furman-era Matrix Affinity. And I see Corona Sparkplug as being the full realization of this. Meanwhile, Leader-1 has been so twisted and warped by his time as Megatron's favorite slave that he no longer cares about the other Mini-Cons, only about revenge. He's pretty tragic, really.  This is all just my own fanficking BS, though, so don't take any of it as canon unless you really like it."  I like Mini-Cons.  A lot.

       Adulthood is weird.  I realize it's in your 20s that you're supposed to start reaching the culmination of all you've worked through your teenage years for, all the interests and hobbies and talents you cultivated.  I'm 25, and I both feel like I've wasted a lot and accomplished a great deal.  I still work retail, and I don't make a lot of money, but I kinda enjoy retail and I'm working in what's really my ideal store.  And honestly, most of the staff is older than me, so it's not like I'm especially pathetic in context or anything.  I'm involved in some insane cool stuff as far as Transformers go, and while it boggles my mind sometimes, I realize there's no reason why I shouldn't have accomplished all that at this point.  I don't feel like I'm somehow entitled to anything I've gotten, and if I really think about it there's nothing I've done that anybody else couldn't do if they followed my footsteps.  But while it's overwhelming sometimes, it feels right.  It feels like the sort of thing that being a fan from teenage years into adulthood should eventually lead to.  I don't consider myself an ambitious person in any way, but I don't want to stagnate, and I will work for the things I want.  I want to keep moving forward so I don't feel like I've been wasting my time, but I don't do it for the sake of a big payoff.  I'm nagged occasionally by the feeling that I should be working toward something more important than Transformers, but I think that's just a remnant of the days when nobody gave Fuck #1 about TFs.  Now they're a big deal, and it feels a little more worthwhile.  It's not a dead-end; I think this fandom and Transformers as a whole have a real future.  That's enough of that.  Time for Armada.

       I was going to post last night, but the phone was tied up.  We got section reassignments at work.  Everybody in the store (except the higher management) is assigned three or four sections to maintain, and they're switched out every few months so nobody gets too bored.  I've been keeping comics through these changes, but this time I picked up Self-Help and Performing Arts.  Since these sections contain shelves on things like relationships, counterculture, and music, I am now responsible for the store's Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll.  Personally, I am not a big fan of self-help books in general.  The genre can be effectively split into two categories: the ones that just have a bunch of formulaic mumbo-jumbo involving a distinct number of something and catchwords that have been trademarked, and the other ones that are just common sense anyway.  The first kind is bullshit, and the second kind is something you shouldn't have to pay somebody else to write down for you.  Popular Self-Help Guru Dr. Phil has a weight-loss book out now.  Apparently it tells you that to lose weight, you have to...stop eating all the time because you're sad and get out and walk or something.  HOLY FUCK!  WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGINED THAT!?  I'm not going to pay some guy to tell me that.  Earlier this year I decided I wanted to drop the ten pounds I had put on since I left high school.  So I went out and walked around the block, about 1.3 miles, pretty much every day.  After a couple months, bam, back to my high school weight.  And look, it stays off if I keep walking every day or two!  And I didn't have to pay some guy $30 to tell me how!  Then again, being depressed makes me lose my appetite anyway.  So running the self-help section is probably going to drive me up a wall.  But I guess it could be worse.  Business books make self-help seem sane.  Apparently it's already started snowing where I used to live in Michigan's UP.  Eek.

       I would like some Energon now, prease.  Thanksgiving was fun enough.  I watched football, which I almost never do, and the Detroit Lions won, which they almost never do.  I like visiting Graham's family, though I always end up skulking around a bit because I can't keep everyone from the extended family straight and don't want to embarass myself.  The cookies came out really well, nice and soft and chewy.  Friday morning was a normal insane shopping day, what with having to be at Wal-Mart around 6-ish to pick up a Landfill set for Graham.  It snowed heavily on the drive home, but we made it through okay.  I got new glasses on Saturday morning just before heading with Graham and Steve to Mid-Ohio-Con.  (Maybe if I get a chance I'll have Walky or Ron take a picture so everybody can see my new glasses.)  There was some shopping, some poking around the exhibitor booth, and some giggling and whispering "Oh my god it's Walter Koenig!"  I stood over his shoulder while Steve got Brian Michael Bendis to sign something and talked to him for a bit, and Bendis seems like a really cool guy.  He seems to still be at this point where, no matter how much Wizard and the rest of the comic press might talk about how he's the best thing since sliced bread, he's still really happy that people are actually reading and liking his stuff.  We went to a panel later where Bendis, Roger Stern, Mark Waid, and Paul Jenkins talked about the business and art of writing comics.  I'm really glad I went to that panel.  It reminded me that I don't need to have some amazingly fresh Vertigo-eqsue universe concocted if I want to get into comics.  I would love to write comics.  I've always been good with dialogue, maybe not Bendis-good, but it's always come very naturally.  That and plotting I'm fine with, it's the prose in between that bogs me down.  So it was pretty fun, though I kinda wish we had been able to go earlier.  And that I had picked up that old Captain Britain from work with the story about how Psylocke was too lame to be Captain Britain for Alan Davis to sign.   urlLink This  is the worst thing to ever exist.

       Happy Thanksgiving to all my American friends!

I just finished baking some cookies, because I'm old enough that I feel like I should be contributing to the food.  They seem to have come out pretty well.  I'm hoping the  urlLink sighting of Energon toys in the US  will spread like wildfire by what my manager calls the Shopocalypse and we'll all have them Friday or soon after.  Happy holidays, I'll be back soon!

       So the jury in the case has  urlLink recommended the death penalty  in the John Allen Mohammed trial.  For those who haven't been keeping up, he's the older of the two responsible for and the now-conviced mastermind of the DC sniper attacks from just over a year ago.  I'm personally glad to hear it.  I'm not a big cheering fan of the death penalty by any means, but I think one of the truly, purely appropriate uses of it is for people like him who have decided that humanity is their prey.  I'd lump any other serial killers in with that, too.  I admit I'm probably a little biased in this specific case, since I had family and friends in DC when it was going on.  Some of the places he struck were places they shopped or bought gas.  He didn't disregard human life, he disregarded humanity as a whole.  He would have taken me down, he would have taken you down, he just didn't care.  So I say fuck 'im.  Civilization can't function with people like him.

       Last night I watched "Airport 1975" on AMC.  I don't know why it was on AMC, except that they seem to have an extremely broad definition of "Classics".  It was a silly, contrived, misogynist movie, and I only started watching it because it has a lot of shots of Dulles at the opening, and I really like Dulles.  Sadly, only the first five minutes or so take place there, and the rest of the movie doesn't have that "Dude, they still HAVE those chairs!" charm.  It does, however, have pilot/stewardess banter that would get people immediately fired today, the most pathetic heroine I've seen in my life (Wah, I don't WANNA fly the plane anymore, wah, it's too scary!), Charlton Heston playing Charlton Heston, and Eric Estrada playing Eric Estrada.  Not to "spoil" the movie for anybody, but I was bummed they killed off Eric Estrada.  "Airplane!" really did not have to work hard to spoof this shit.  There was even a little kid who needed to get hooked back up to her dialysis machine.  And some nuns.  And one of the nuns sang.

       This isn't going to make a lot of sense.  Whether it makes more or less sense because I am also violently multitasking remains to be seen.  I think I may have gotten to the bottom of my creative problems.  I hope I have, because I need to create.  I've gotten too sidetracked and I've been ignoring my muse.  I don't know how I reached this point.  I could get all introspective and try to blame it on all kinds of things.  Goodness knows I could come up with enough possibilities: I've grown complacent with my lot in life, I've been through too many upheavals (I've learned that major sudden life changes, like moving, can disjoint stuff like that, like when I fell out of TFs in the first place), or maybe it was simply the upheavals that I've had to consider in my own creative work while I set things on the backburner and hold my breath, or the feeling that I can't go forward until I know how things are going to happen when they could take years to resolve.  I could even blame other distracting muses, to whatever extent you can blame things who are not real.  Maybe I was "growing up."  Maybe it was a lot of different things all chipping away it.  I hope I can hold on to this for more than a day or two.  I hope that voice that was always the clearest in my head (yes, yes, head voices, but I mean the kind that are self-initiated by imagination, not the ones that come out of nowhere because you're psycho) is back to stay, because I need it.  I'm not saying, "Oooo, I'm gonna write a big long story tonight!"  I think I need to go back and immerse myself a little bit in my old stuff so I can remember what I was doing, to pick up where I left off in a manner of speaking.  I need to try to anchor this while I have it.  Maybe I'll go try to glue that figurine back together...

       Pine cat litter is the best stuff ever.  I only bought it because PetSmart was out of the stuff I normally get, and I needed something cheap that could be washed out in the bathtub.  But it's really good.  It absorbs extremely well, and I like getting a clean pellet of it and letting it soak up a drop of water so I can watch it puff up.  It absorbs so well I wasn't even overwhelmed by noxious fumes from the stuff that had drained to the bottom.  There  was  no stuff that had drained to the bottom, it's that good.  And the dry pellets are big enough that I can vacuum them up easily when she inevitably kicks half of them out of the box.  I highly recommend this stuff to anybody who's got a cat.  And that's my Random Product Endorsement of the Day.

       Check out  urlLink Jackpot's TF art site .  He's got some unused Dreamwave "More Than Meets The Eye" art that makes you wonder what was wrong with them.  According to the  urlLink "Gender Genie" , I write like a man.  So take that, Graham.  I do not write like a girl.  The opening scene to  urlLink "The Last Mini-Con"  got me:  Female Score: 346 Male Score: 615  The Gender Genie thinks the author of this passage is: male!  Okay, so it doesn't take into account whether you are, in fact, writing a story about giant warring robots that revolves around how they feel about things.  And plugging old blog entries in it comes up with slightly-female results at Female Score: 2526/Male Score: 2080.  But as far as fanfic goes, it's still proof.  I'm trying to stay up very late tonight because I'm on the "overnight shift" Sunday.  We only do these 7PM-3AM shifts for special events, this time Christmas decorating.  It seems to involve a free dinner at Steak-and-Shake, and I'm all for that.  Oh, that's right, I was gonna do a weekly feature, and I guess Saturday night/Sunday morning is as good a time for that as any.  The inaugural Cool Used Book Shop Find of the Week:  A set of the three Gundam novels from 1990.

       If anybody has too much money to spend this Christmas and wants to get me a nice Christmas present, one of these  urlLink Mulberry leather GBASP cases  from Europe would do  very  nicely.  I do realize that my last post (that wasn't a web quiz) was highly ironic.  But I  have  been trying to spend more time offline.  I'm currently up to three books I'm in the middle of reading:   urlLink A book about weblogs ,  urlLink the new Al Franken book , and  urlLink a British cyberpunk novel .  I don't usually read this much non-fiction, actually, but accumulating books is just what happens when you work at a bookstore - especially one where everything's dirt cheap.  And I find myself facinated by the idea of books about internet culture.  Maybe I'm just not accustomed to the existance of books about a culture I myself am so totally immersed in.  I suppose that's just another part of that growing-up business, that people my own age and with my own interests and habits actually write books and get them published.  And I couldn't pass up Franken's new one, since the conservative media it debates is part of my work life - that and, much like him, I wonder what is wrong with Ann Coulter.  And it was $10.  And I was needing some new sci-fi.  I will finish one of these before next week, I swear it.  And if I finish Franken's book fast enough, I can sell it back to my store for $5.  I think, at the end of the week, I will introduce a new feature to my blog: Used Book Shop Find of the Week.  I already have some good candidates lined up.

       We had to figure out how to relight the pilot light on our heater tonight.  Fall's definitely here.  I finally found Nemesis Prime tonight.  AT KROGER.  I know it's pretty much standard issue to gripe about how your area's distribution is worse than everybody else's, but holy fuck, the GROCERY STORE got him in before any real stores!?  What's up with that?  I want Energon to just come out already.  I think I should try to spend less time on the computer.  Not that you, my dear (I initially typed "dead" for some reason) internet buddies, are not worth my time.  I just find myself putting things off, ignoring things that need to be done, and just generally behaving as a person with that thing they like to call "internet addiction".  I sorta wonder about this "internet addiction" idea applied to myself.  I inititally want to see it as a symptom of cyberpunk-inclination, the sort of thing you do because they won't yet let you put actual plugs and wires in your brain.  I think it was for much the same reason that I got a cell phone: not because I expected people to call me all the time, but simply so I could be  connected .  If something happened, I would know.  (Note: If any of you are on Virgin Mobile or just have text messaging, you let me know.)  But I'm sure there are many, many people out there with the same problem who have never read a William Gibson novel, and possibly have not even heard of him.  I wonder if there are different kinds of internet addiction, or if they're all just different shades of an information addiction.  But I think this might hold the key to my writer's block and general feelings of boredom lately.  I need to get off the internet and do other things.  I need to spend time reading books and playing video games.  I walk almost daily to keep my body from getting fat because I spend so much of the rest of my day sitting around, but maybe sitting in front of the computer doing the same things all the time is making my brain "fat".  I need to get offline more often.  But not tonight.  Tonight's  urlLink LONAC  night.

       Boy, Columbus'  urlLink mayoral election  today sure was exciting.  I still went and voted, though.  I love Columbus, so I did some research on the little local races and went and did me some voting.  I also voted for Mike Coleman, though.  He's unopposed 'cause he rocks.  In other news,  urlLink Transformers.com  has actually managed to beat the info-leakers with a couple of previously-unseen Energon Wave 2 toys.  I'm really looking forward to this line.  Something about the colors in general really, really appeals to me.  Maybe it's all the blues and whites.  I'm dying to see Arcee, though.

       Is anybody familiar with a techno song from the early 90s that incorporated sound bites from "The Running Man"?  WHFS back in DC used to play it all the time in their late-night techno show, and I'd love to find it, but I don't even know what it's called.  My angst at not being able to afford much in the way of new GBA games right now has compelled me to dig out the oldskool Final Fantasy Tactics.  I actually only bought a PS1 last fall, once they were marked down to $50, and I only have a handful of games for it.  I originally gave up FFT because I got stuck on the Dorter Trade City battle real early in the game, and I'm awful about forgetting a game as soon as I'm stuck.  But I started over and levelled up well before it this time.  So if I'm not around much and not updating a lot, well, that's why.  It's addictive, and unlike my GBA games, I can't get my day's fix on my lunch break.  Not that that stopped me from playing Pokemon Sapphire for hours at home.  I neeeeeed FFT Advance.  And Pokemon Pinball.  And Megaman Battle Network Blue.  And...  Okay, that could go on for days.  I really need to get inspired to write again.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  Sometimes I think I'm just getting old, which is sad.  I'd like to do something for the fan club mag, but I can't get my head together enough to come up with a solid story idea.  I blame Armada.  It's got so many interesting concepts that I want to use, but it's not cohesive enough in and of itself to give me inspiration for actual stories - except for just writing my own take on the whole series.  But all those concepts have pushed a lot of other stuff out of my head.  I could do a G1 story, but what?  I was feeling kind of inspired to go back to Firestormers and do some prequel stories with Trixter and Upstart right around the time the Earth Autobots get back in contact with the Cybertron-based ones, something in the background of the comic and maybe even a Matrix Quest story, but I don't want something about fanchars for the club mag.  I haven't even been able to do much on Armada Legend for Sipher because I've had too much else distracting me.  I get brief flashes where I  feel  really creative and inspired, but nothing comes of it anymore.  Maybe it's my living situation; I simply cannot write with someone else in the room.  Maybe I  am  getting old.  Maybe I'm simply far too happy with my lot in life these days and I don't  need  the escapism that fed the fantasies that led to my fanfics.  But I really need to write something other than this blog.  Especially because I'd really like to do something for the fan mag.  I guess I'll go play Final Fantasy Tactics some more...

       An interesting thing happened this, um, noon.  When I went to take a shower at 11:30, I noticed there was a fire chief car (no, not a Lamborghini) in a parking space behind the building with its lights on.  Odd.  So I took my shower and then turned on the 12-o'clock news.  They cut away to a live report of a fire in a Grandview Heights apartment building.  And there they were, reporting from two buildings over, where there had been a fire in a ground-floor apartment.  It didn't seem to have spread too far, though it really did a job on that one apartment.  It was just so surreal seeing them reporting live from  right over there,  by the dumpster behind that building with the door.  The kicker was the guy with the shopping cart who walked by while they were shooting.  (There's a Kroger right up the street.)  Just half a minute later I heard him rattle by my window.  Hee hee...  Oh, I found  urlLink a short article  on the channel's  urlLink web site .  Though they call it Upper Arlington.  We're right where the two neighborhoods meet.

        urlLink *Photo blog updated.*   While I'm taking toy pics I should really get some shots of self-combined Energon toys, since Graham and I each have a set.  I've gotten good and caught up on toys lately, even managing to score Asajj Ventress to add to my Jedi (and now Sith) Women collection.  I could take pics of all that, but...eh.  Everybody else will see them when they buy them and I'm hardly the first to put pics of them up.  If I have something unique to contribute I'll do so.  Today I forgot I had traded shifts with Melanie at work, so I showed up at 9AM when I didn't have to be in 'till 2PM.  So I picked up some fresh paint at Hobby Lobby and started on that Upstart toy I've been meaning to do.   urlLink This is what I have so far.   It's been a long time since I tried painting non-model plastic.  I had to wash it to get the production oils off the surface, and I think I might have to score the already-painted parts like his nosecone with super-fine sandpaper just to get it to stick right.  And the joints are being bitchtacular.  WHY don't toys come apart as cleanly as they did in the G1-through-Beast Wars days?  It made them so much easier to repaint.  *sob*  But I think the ends will justify the pain in the ass.  So I won't be online much for the rest of the week because of this big get-together.  Check my photo blog, though, because I'm sure I'll have lots of fun stuff to upload.  If nothing else, I'll take some good shots around town while showing everybody around.   urlLink Psycho baby people scare me.   A LOT.  What's so fucked up in your life that you have to not only lie to everybody about being pregnant, but then kill somebody so you can  cut out their fetus  so people don't ask why you haven't had that baby yet.

        urlLink So much for a Dean/Clark ticket.   :p  I just know that, as soon as I get home with my digital camera, I'm going to proceed to spend all my time taking pictures of my cat.  You'd think after 16 years I would be less impressed with her sleeping in a tidy little lump or streching or lying comfortably in strange places.  But I'm not.  I'm considering starting a photo-blog, since I'm pretty sure Fateback gives me a heaping pile of webspace that I just use for archiving fanfics that nobody has given a fuck about since 1998.  Not of my cat.  Of things like Columbus and just everyday things that I think are interesting or photogenic.  Possibly my cat every now and then.  I have a bit of an eye for things, as anybody who waited patiently for me to take out my camera and photograph a particularly interesting angle of an overpass at OTFCC this past year would know.  But be warned: me with a digital camera will be a dangerous thing.  This warning is especially extended to anybody planning to be at the annual #wiigii! New Year's Throwdown.

       Before I get to my toy talk, I must take a moment to vent about something that annoys me.  I don't like bitching about customers in my blog, but since this was something that was also annoying other customers by in turns holding up lines on the Saturday before Christmas and generally creating a scene, I think it's a safe general bitching.  I really, really can't stand the Technologically Paranoid.  These are generally people ignorant of computers outside the sensationalized accounts of a tiny percentage of people whose information gets hacked.  To deter people selling us hot merchandise (more commonly DVDs or CDs than books), we ask for IDs.  We put these driver's license numbers in the computer just on the off chance they're needed in a police investigation.  There are laws governing this; we fall under the same laws as pawn shops when it comes to buying merchandise from the public as a business and as such we have to get certain seller information in case of stolen stuff.  I assume this exempts us from being charged with buying stolen merchandise, too.  But of course you have some people who see us getting their precious ID in the vicinity of a computer and they freak out.  We don't send this stuff over the internet.  It's not something that can be pulled up except in the event of said police investigation.  But it doesn't stop a handful of ignorant people from being certain, absolutely certain, that if their driver's license number is entered into a computer, by tomorrow either a random hacker or even one of our own employees will be pressing crateloads of credit cards in their name.  Far more women are raped by random attackers than fall victim to this insidious "identity theft", and I bet that'd leave them feeling a damn sight more violated, but they sure do manage to face that risk by leaving their houses to come and fuck with us and annoy our other customers.  If they're that terrified by everything, they should just stay at home.  Reasonable precaustions are enough to protect us in our everyday life.  Too many people act like scared animals, running from any percieved threat because they haven't learned or are too stupid to figure out when it's really a wolf lurking in the shadows and when it's just some perfectly benevolent humans who they're insulting.  Who wants their stupid identities anyway?  I would like to point my toy-minded friends to something called Xevoz.  I would point you to their web site, at  urlLink www.xevoz.com , but, um, it's not up yet.  So instead I'll point you to  urlLink Entertainment Earth's listing .  I picked up on of these - specifically the  urlLink Alpha Ranger  - at TRU last night during an otherwise disappointing toy run.  They're a permutation of  urlLink Stikfas , complete with the logo on the bottom of the bubble.  They're bigger than Stikfas and incorporate a dice game, but otherwise they have all the posability and interchangability of the former line.  And they totally rock.  It's a shame that my faction of choice took a name from the second best animated series of the 90s.  Also in Trixter's Exciting Toy News: I picked up Alternators Smokescreen the other night, and he also rocks.  I went out and found him on my lunch break and even my coworkers were impressed.  I'm clearing out Armada now, so I suppose he'll take the spot on the coffee table where my Energon stuff's been.  I really need shelves.

       Fuck.  I feel awful.  I need to rest.  I need to sleep.  I need to not constantly have  something  I need to be doing, like shopping for Christmas presents or wrapping Christmas presents or shipping Christmas presents or driving all over the place looking for toys that I know I'm not going to find or working or remembering  someone  I forgot to buy something for.  *sob*  I think I've still got a little of the flu; I know it took Graham a good week and a half or so to totally shake this one.  This is just not the time for me to be feeling run-down.  I don't have time to be sick.  Ugh.  I love the holidays, but I just want them to be over, finished!  I'm dying to do this redeco of Skyblast, but I'd feel bad buying one before Christmas.  He seems to be the most popular basic here, and I want kids to be able to get him for Christmas.  I already have blue and red paint from Gundam kits.  I need to work on some Gundam kits...  I'm going to go wrap some presents (yes, in the middle of the night, because that's the only free time I have), so if you're inclined, you could go read  urlLink this CNN.com article  on  urlLink Wesley Clark .  At first I wasn't sure I could respect a guy named Wesley.  I blame the Crusher boy.  But now I like him.   urlLink Howard Dean  is okay enough, and certainly an improvement, but an ex-military guy seems like a better choice right now.  Dean seems a bit squishy.  I just hope Clark gets enough attention before the primaries.   urlLink John Kerry  also seems like a good choice, but he's lagging so far behind in the early polls that I don't have much hope left for him.  *sigh*  I really don't feel like wrapping presents...

       I failed.  I got sick.  I'm supposed to be at work today, but I called out in the hope that a day of lying on the couch drinking orange juice and echinacea tea would drive away the feeling of complete exhaustion I get after doing anything at all.  I presume this is the flu Graham's been fighting with for a week and a half.  I tend to recover from viruses fast, though, so hopefully I'll be up to going to work tomorrow.  In the meantime I have Alan Greenspan on TV for no readily apparent reason other than because I've been reading too many political books lately.  I should read "City of Fear" while I'm couch-sitting, too.  Woo, zombies.

       I will not get sick this winter.  I've already been taking vitamin C and zinc suppliments because of all the terrible things I get exposed to at work, and that's protected me for most of the year from anything viral.  (Stuff I pick up from bad fast food, sadly, cannot be stopped so easily.)  I've decided to bolster it with some echinacea tea and lots of OJ.  Graham's had a bit of this flu or something for a week and a half now, and I think I've managed to protect myself from it.  I was feeling kinda run-down yesterday, though, but I didn't really get enough sleep.  So this week is the end of Armada.  Energon's hitting the shelves in force, the last five episodes of the show are running on Cartoon Network, and the last issue of the comic before it changes over to Energon came out yesterday.  (The letters page ROCKED, BTW.)  I think I would feel better about buying the Energon toys already if some part of the fiction had started up, or even if Hasbro had put up their bios, but I don't have the patience to wait for another month before buying them.  I keep getting ideas in my head about their characters, sometimes not even consciously, and inevitably the fiction doesn't match up.  I'm already glad I picked up somewhere (Talking to Aaron at OTFCC, I think? Heh, I'm gonna  assume  he didn't just tell me about it 'cause it was me...) that Inferno was supposed to be a young, tough character, because I would have pegged him as older.  I'm really sad to see Armada go, though.  I think it really hit me the hardest when we watched the final episode at Walky's that he downloaded from the UK showing, but now even the comic is over and we've reached the point where those of us with limited display space put away our old toys and put out the new.  It's over, finished.  No more plight of the Mini-Cons, who are not only tragic and magical and being oppressed but also very small.  I mean, I know they'll be around, but it's not going to be  about  them anymore.  Maybe I'll use the wrap-up to start thinking about that fanfic I kinda want to do, now that nothing new's likely to happen to...well, okay, it doesn't really matter if it gets contradicted, because it contradists everything anyway.  But the point is, Armada's over and, while I like Energon okay and all, I'm sad.  Well, I don't like that Energon looks like it's gonna have Quints.  Stupid Quints.  FUCK YOU, QUINTESSONS!

       I keep really wanting to compose and post insightful essays on the state of the fandom and geek culture and culture in general, but then I keep doing it on  urlLink alt.toys.transformers  and it takes all the impetus out of me.  I suppose people  might  just come here to read about how my day went, but I'd certainly like to contribute something deeper.  I'll probably wax so political come next year that people will take me off their lists over on LiveJournal, but things haven't kicked into high enough gear yet.  So I suppose, for lack of anything important to contribute to the internet today, I will talk about how yesterday was the Best Day Ever.  This is primarily due to three events:  1) I found an issue of Fantastic Four from 1990 that has Death's Head in it.  I happened across it as I was pricing a box of comics that I got as a transfer from another store.  Sometimes one store'll have more comics than they know what to do with, so they send them to the warehouse so other stores can take them if they want, or they can take them back later.  We've been kinda dry lately, so I've been taking them off their hands a lot.  I think at some point I had gotten confused and thought the FF story from Incomplete Death's Head was from the FF series, and that's what I thought I found at first, but upon looking at the story I realized it was one I hadn't read yet.  Oh, happy day!  I'm sorta thinking of making a nice online archive for obscure DH stories like this and the Marvel Comics Presents story.  I've also been working on one of the most complete collections of Comics Simon Furman is Vaguely Embarassed to Admit He Wrote, but for his sake I probably won't catalog them.  I mean, does anybody really want to  read  Brute Force?  Isn't knowing of its existance enough?  2) I made a grown man run away in fear.  After some exchanges between me and a co-worker about a guy looking kinda suspicious, I wandered over at her suggestion to see if he was a known troublemaker - we have a handful of recurring problem people, but nobody too bad currently.  So I go over there, and I stare at him incredulously as he zips up a pocket of his coat that's clearly got big angular shapes poking out of it.  I went back to tell the shift leader, and as soon as I was out of sight the guy walks to the door, manages to walk to the edge of the sidewalk, and fucking  runs  as soon as he hits the pavement.  He just bolted across the parking lot and around the corner.  Actually stopping shoplifters is a tricky business, but hopefully the fact that he was for all intents and purposes caught will keep him away for a while.  3) After all that work-related fun, I got some Energon deluxes.  No Starscream, but I kept myself amused letting Hot Shot and Inferno take turns being on top.  Awww yeah.  Energon is the single most inherently unintentionally dirty line we've had so far.  I mean, Armada was bad enough that I was actively worried about the fanfic I wrote sounding like gay erotica (I rewrote one part repeatedly until I got the best phrasing), but Energon still manages to be worse.  I like them a lot, whether because of or despite the gay-gay.  I'm actually tempted to write a review, which I never do because I'm awful at them because I'm a girl and like toys intuitively and not analytically, but I might save it for Glen if I do.  Pretty soon Graham and I are going over to the Drexel Grandview to see  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep .  Tell me that doesn't look like the best movie ever.

Your saturation level is lower than average - You don't stress out over things and don't understand people who do. Finishing projects may sometimes be a challenge, but you schedule time as you see fit and the important things all happen in the end, even if not everyone sees your grand master plan.

       Some links for the afternoon:   urlLink Ancient Roman D20s  are just mad geeky.  Also mad geeky,  urlLink CNN.com 's got  urlLink an article about Segways  that shows the further progression of the Segway->mecha evolution.  Y'see, while everybody else was picking on the Segway when it came out, I realized what it truly was: the Missing Link in the design evolution of mecha.  We could make arms that move, legs that walk - and now we can make the whole thing balance right.  Though the AI applications the military wants are fine by me, too.  I hate to wax political, but stuff like  urlLink this other CNN.com article on standardized testing and special ed students  really makes me seriously wonder if the whole point of this "No Child Left Behind" law is to deliver public schools into the hands of private companies just like Bush has delivered everything else to them.  You can not seriously create a law mandating that 99% of students must pass a standardized grade-level test without making an exception for seriously disabled students and, realistically, ESL students.  (Though I suppose you could hold the ESL kids up to the same math standards.)  It's clearly engineered either by people with no understanding whatsoever of special education or people who simply want the schools to fail and be turned over to private corporations.  I'm off today, and I'll likely be bored, so maybe I'll weigh in on other exciting things later.  In the meantime, if you are also not at work, you could go snicker at/get off on the contributions at  urlLink www.transformerotica.com .

       Woo!  Energon!  So yeah, I found some Energon toys today.  I wanted to stick a "finally" in there, but that seems a bit strong a word for something that only appeared at retail less than a week ago.  I guess it's just that I've been seeing them since summer, so I've gotten really sick of waiting for them to come out already.  This is why I don't like looking a toy pictures way in advance.  But I think I've avoided stuff enough that I'm still really happy to find them for them, and not just because I'm sick of waiting.  I found all the toys that have come out at Wal-Mart so far, which means Prime, Ironhide, and Treadbolt.  I only got Ironhide because I can't afford Prime without another paycheck and I can't really afford redecos with everything else that's out now.  Though I'll probably eventually get Treadbolt for his Rollout.  Ironhide's great, though.  I wasn't as enthusiastic about him as I am about some of the smaller toys because I had just sort of written him off in my mind as Red Alert 2.0, but I'm glad I'm getting to appreciate him before Hot Shot and Inferno show up.  He's a really nice, solid toy, and I keep wanting to remix his turret sound.  Though as soon as I opened him I felt an overwhelming need to give him a Mini-Con.  I've assigned him Rod for the time being, with Atlas and the redeco Emergency Team for support.  I'm really, really gonna miss Mini-Cons.  I know there'll still be some, but it won't be the same.  Sorta on the subject, on my way home this dude got out of his car at a red light and asked me if I really liked Transformers (my plates say MINI CON), and I grinned and showed him my new acquisition.  And he asked me who that big guy that all the Constructicons turned into was, and I answered "Devastator!" with a big, impressive voice, and we laughed and went about our business.  I like my life.  It's so weird and fun.  Oh my god, it's  urlLink The Ant and the Aardvark figures !

       I don't spend nearly enough time appreciating my  urlLink Game Boy Advance SP .  Sure, I gazed at it with big, adoring eyes when I first bought it, but within minutes I had put in Pokemon Sapphire and proceeded to ignore the design altogether.  It's usually either in a very tasteful leather case or being played, and neither lends itself to a proper appreciation of the design.  It's only when it's being charged or I've neglectfully left it on the coffee table that I glance over and realize just how nice it is.  The GBA SP is an absolutely beautiful device.  Folded, it's tiny and almost featureless, with only a seam around the middle and a small, silver Nintendo logo.  It fits easily into my palm, and it weighs just enough to let me know it's there.  At the back are two ports large enough to let you know this is a serious device.  Open it up via a spring-loaded hinge with precicely the right tension, and you have a classic Game Boy layout, but simpler.  Admittedly, I've always veered toward the translucent Game Boys, so the simplicity of the opaque SP is very striking to me.  The buttons have a very satisfying clickiness to them.  The flat design of the control surface, with depressions for the thin buttons so it can fold properly, is almost elegant.  The tension in the buttons themselves is evocative of a folding cell phone, with a satisfying clickiness.  Closed, the SP is as thick as the original GBA, but opened up it's evident just how much compacting had to be done for this design.  A proprietary lithium-ion battery had to be used not just to provide enough power for the backlighting, but also because no half of the SP is thick enough to accept common AA batteries.  Overall, it feels much more like an "important" device like a cell phone than it does a portable game console.  I am still smitten.

       I'm not usually one for posting song lyrics to my blog to highlight my moods or experiences.  But I discovered that my newly-acquired FLCL soundtrack has translated lyrics, and I want to share the translation of the lyrics to "Ride On Shooting Star".  I'll include the Japanese as well, to illustrate that this isn't just Engrish.  Mostly.  (Parsing is copied from the liner notes.)  Slide of an orange reflects in the sky / Orange no slido utsusu sora Hanging on a pride of sponge / Sponge no pride burasagete   Spider No need to hide / Iketotta sono yokanwa The premonition of live capture / Kakusanakutatte iinda It is like a colored dream / Irono tsuita yume mitaina  Ride on shooting star I continued singing / Kokorono koede sandanjyuno youni Like a shotgun with all of my heart / Utai tsuzuketa  A grunge hamster becomes more mature / Grunge no hamster otonabite And accompanied by a lobster of revenge / Revenge no lobster hikitsurete  Sniper What do you say that / Fuchidotta sono sekaini You can see in that framed world? / Naniga mierutte lunda I want to touch it before you aim / Neraumaeni sawaritaina  Ride on shooting star I'm looking for you and I'm having withdrawl symptoms / Kimiwo sagashite kindan shoujyouchuu I lied to you / Usowo tsuita  Ride on shooting star I continued singing / Kokorono koede sandanjyuno youni Like a shotgun with all my heart / Utai tsuzuketa  Yeah.  Um, that's my angsty, misunderstood life, all right.  Especially the part about the lobster of revenge.

       Got the  urlLink main site  revamped and updated today.  Ohayocon was fun, but I think I would have enjoyed it infinitely more if 1) I hadn't still been suffering through this sinus infection and the related medicine side-effects, and 2) if the line for autographs from the Inuyasha panel hadn't been so darn slow.  However,  urlLink Scott looks the same as always .  I had him sign my Fleer Jetfire card, which he hadn't seen before and was impressed by.   urlLink Richard Cox  and  urlLink Jillian Michaels  were really cool to meet, especially when Scott's line was backing up.    I did pick up a FLCL soundtrack from the dealer room, but that and lunch depleted my meager funds.  I didn't need any more plush toys anyway.  I got a bunch of cosplay pictures, too, but...do you really wanna see those?

       Blargh.  I feel  terrible  today.  Got another sinus infection.  I'm desperately hoping I'll feel a little better before  urlLink Ohayocon  tomorrow, but these things usually take a couple days to run their course.  I took today off in hopes of keeping my voice, unlike last time this happened.  I think a lot of you know what I'm talking about.  I still spent most of yesterday sounding a hell of a lot like Raven from Teen Titans, though.  I think the moral is that I need to find a new doctor, one who doesn't just throw antibiotics at all my problems and will actually take a look at why I get these messed up infections all the time.  I mean, who even GETS inner ear infections?  I'm still not even 100% better from that one; I still veer violently off-course if I close my eyes while walking.  I should probably just go straight to an ear-nose-throat specialist, if my insurance will let me circumvent the referral process.  I think part of the problem is that I haven't had a regular doctor in over 10 years, and it's been about 12 since I had a proper physical exam.  So when I tell the doctor that I've been having regular sinus and breathing problems "for a while now," he's probably thinking "a couple months," not a significant portion of my lifetime.  I need a fresh doctor who has time for me to sit down and say, "Look, I have had these problems since I was a teenager and they've never been properly checked out.  Please look into it."  And then maybe I can climb the stairs to my apartment without panting.  Hopefully I'll have the new version of my web site up tomorrow, with or without a mascot graphic.  Don't expect it to be more technically sophisticated than the current one; I still don't believe a person needs a web site that can't be coded in Notepad.  I'm launching it with the Ohayocon report, which will ideally have a little bit of information from Scott and Kirby about Energon and possibly Gundam SEED and stuff.  And picutres of the hot, hot voice actors.  I'm going to assume I'll be feeling up to it.  For the, like, two of you who haven't stopped reading and skipped this entry now, let me take a moment to angst at you: Graham and I might be going to England this summer.  The problem with this is the "might".  It'll depend on him getting one of a shrinking number of research assistanceship grants from his school, because otherwise he'll have to teach.  If we could go, it would be one of the happiest things ever for me, and I wouldn't be able to thank his parents enough for making it possible.  But the uncertainty is driving me crazy.  I already let my hope gets raised a little bit, and now I don't even want to think that we might not be able to go.  It'd just be too great if we could, even if I'd still have to put a good chunk of money toward a passport and more memory cards for my camera.

       I'm on top of the world these days.  If you asked me when I was 15 where I wanted to be in ten years, I'd probably say right here.  Okay, I would have either said I would doubtlessly be dead or I wanted to be a cyborg.  I was fucked up.

       So today I found the  urlLink Superfriends Aquaman/Black Manta two-pack  from DC Direct on a really good sale at Comic Town.  Like, marked down 70% from the original $50.  (Yes, DC Direct is EXPENSIVE.)  So I had to buy him.  Anybody who has had to live or ESPECIALLY work with me knows that I think Aquaman is the funniest thing in all of pop culture.  (Thor is a close second place.)  I will openly admit that my most ingrained impression of the DC universe is what I got from watching Superfriends and Super Powers as a very small child.  This is part of why I have this usually latent attachment to Cyborg, because I thought he was AWESOME, and I was thrilled to death to see him in the Teen Titans cartoon.  By the same token, I've always, always thought Aquaman was a total goofball.  He had no personality whatsoever except a vapidness implied by his grinning blondness, and a really lame power to boot.  But then DC decided they wanted to make him this awesome badass and give him long hair and no shirt and a hook hand.  And I was all like, "Um, no."  I like Silver Age/Superfriends Aquaman because it's who he IS.  He's this dippy nobody with a lame power, and no amount of 90s hardcore is going to change that.  I like that image of him because it stands in the face of aggressive attempts to make not-camp out of something that can be loved for its campiness.  They could have found a more subtle way to make him a good character that might have worked, and then I probably wouldn't think he was any funnier than Batman.  I don't generally think Batman is funny.  Good, yes, funny, not usually.  Batman is probably the first superhero I had any real knowledge of, from the Scooby Doo crossovers I watched when I was, like, 4.  By 5 I thought the old 60s show was serious action.  Me and Batman go back a long way, and even now I don't tend to think of the older Batman cartoons as funny.  When I watch it, it's hilariously silly, but I still subconsciously think of him as one of the more respectable parts of Superfriends.  Wow, this is turning into a rambling thing.  I'm gonna sleep.  I really need to work on coding my new site tomorrow.

       Top Ten Reasons Billy Should Move to Columbus:  10) There are companies here you could work for that stand a pretty good chance of being around in a year, plus they hire people outside of temp agencies.  9) Corporate radio's barely made a dent here.  You can find an independant, locally-owned station for any genre, including two hard rock stations and a really good alt-rock one.  8) For that matter we even have competing cable companies.  The one we're looking at switching to soon has a cable and broadband package for $60 a month.  No cable monoploy here!  7) Rent is beautifully low.  You could live downtown here for what you'd pay to live in Fairfax, and you're fucking  downtown  and not out in some lame suburb.  Or for less than half that you could live in one of the other neighborhoods a couple miles from downtown.  6) Crime's pretty low here, and even if you venture into one of the worse neighborhoods, most murders here actually get  solved .  And our sniper only stays on the south edge of town and can't aim for shit.  5) You already know people here, and you've never even dated any of them, which saves you from  that  awkward situation.  4) For that matter there are plenty of people you  could  date.  Columbus has a pretty big gay population, and some of them are pretty hot...  3) We have Tim Horton's.  And a wide assortment of other really good fast food places, like Donato's and Charley's and Graeter's Ice Cream.  2) We have MEIJER.  1) Walky's gonna need a new roommate in a few months when Ron moves out!

       This is the forecast this week for where I used to live:    So today Mark, one of the managers (and possibly soon the  main  manager) at my store, took me aside before I went out to start my day and broke it to me that I've been taken off comics.  It's a good thing I was in high spirits already, because there have been days when something like that would have made me cry.  He reassured me that it wasn't because I wasn't doing well, in fact I was one of the best comics people they've had, but I had been doing the section for over a year now and he wanted me to direct that energy toward some other part of the store.  Matt has been given the section, and I can't argue that he's not every bit as qualified as I am, though apparently he made some comments to the effect of expecting some kind of horrible act of vengance from me.  Honestly, ever since we hired a couple more big comic geeks, I've been wondering when I was going to lose the section to one of them.  It was easy when I was the only one there besides Mark (who is busy managing) and Sarah (who is busy doing warehouse ordering stuff) who was really qualified, but the competition brought by Matt and Aaron and Josh filled me with a bit of dread.  Oh, but I still have SELF-HELP, thanks.  Mark assures me that as soon as more thorough section reassignments are made he'll do something about that.  Nobody deserves to run self-help four months straight.  I would go on for a bit about the first issue of Energon, but I don't want to spoil those who haven't read it.  Maybe I'll have my feelings sorted out in a week or so, when anybody who's going to read it has been given a reasonable amount of time to do so.  I will try to explain my paradoxical feelings without spoiling, though, now that I've had a workday to let them simmer.  I like Energon.  This issue had a very good pace for an opener, and it seems like it may get a chance to touch on some concepts and background that I really wanted to see in Armada.  But in the process it has given me a great deal to think about, and some of my rock-solid personal concepts are getting an upheaval.  I think it's mostly that Over-Run seems to be playing the role I always imagined for Sparkplug, and that's the most I'll elaborate.  That gets me feeling a little...not upset, but pensive.  My mind needs to restructure.  Yes, I have far, FAR too much emotional investment in the Mini-Cons and their origins and their purpose, and specifically Sparky.  Wanna make something of it?

       A couple weeks ago a co-worker of mine commented that I always seemed a lot happier when I was working on comics than when I was stocking self-help.  "That's because I never look at a comic book and think, 'I have that problem'," I replied.

       I finally got the  urlLink #wiigii! New Year's party pics  online.  I'll have a lot of new stuff in my  urlLink Photo Blog  once Fateback stops being cunty.  It's just up enough for me to upload the picture sites from their web-based uploading, but I'm still having trouble logging in from a remote FTP, i.e. Blogger.  Today I put in for time off to go to  urlLink Ohayocon  at the end of the month so I can pester the always-amazingly-cool  urlLink Scott McNeil .   urlLink Kirby Morrow  will also be in attendance, so it'll be neat to meet him for the first time.  I'll definitely have to pack the camera - these guys are serious beefcakes.  And I  suppose  in addition to ogling them I should also see if they can let me in on any news about Energon, since both of them will presumably be revising their Armada roles.  It'll probably be some kind of special exclusive.  Who else is gonna be reporting from  Ohayocon ?  I'm sort of dubious about the whole thing, admittedly, because I've never been to something that is less a simple anime con than a thing devoted to all things otaku.  I know some of the others here are thinking of not going, but I can't pass up Scott right here in Columbus, even if it means going to a convention full of otaku.  Maybe I'll put on my cat ears so I can blend in.  Yeah, that's it...

       This just in:  urlLink Bush Daughters Horrid Little Bitches   I'm sitting here drinking hot liquids to soothe my throat and taking a 500-song survey for  urlLink CD101 , the local really good radio station.  I signed up for their occasional survey about new songs a couple months ago, and apparently they like to do a big one for most of the backlist at the beginning of the year.  You get points for it, which you can use for T-shirts and stuff, so I'm wading through it.  I already coded some host pages for all my #wiigii! New Year's pictures, but Fateback's being hard to get along with, so I can't upload them right now.  I'll let everybody know when those are up.  I'm also updating the  urlLink photo blog  with some silly toy pics and random other stuff once I'm able to.

       Retro is so surreal.  I was at Target today, even though I'm supposed to be staying at home because I'm sick.  For those who want too much information, I had to go buy TAMPONS.  But of course I went to look at the toys first.  I've gotten used to things to a certain extent now.  I'm not startled by the Care Bears or the Strawberry Shortcake, and I've been buying a lot of the My Little Ponies.  And yes, there's TRANSFORMERS, which only sort of count as retro because they never properly went away.  What I was not expecting was to find, on the same day, was both Rainbow Brite toys (which actually I thought were a Hot Topic exclusive) and Muppet Babies plushies.  Neither seem to have exactly had a big makeover, either.  At least Strawberry Shortcake's a bit of a tomboy now.  It's not like all this retro business doesn't WORK.  Yeah, I wanna go buy a Rainbow Brite.  But it's still startling and surreal.  I'm not all that sick, in case you were worried.  I've been having a bad cough, brought on by a kind of clenching irritation in my throat.  I had it for a month last spring.  I noticed it came on when the weather suddenly got really warm and humid for a couple days, and it got better after a good's night sleep two feet away from the gas heater only to start up again when I went outside.  So I suspect it'll be clearing up now that the weather's drier again.  I went to the doctor and he said it was an infection again, but given that antibiotics didn't do a damn thing last time, it seems to be clearing up already, and he didn't seem to put much work into coming to that conclusion, I'm not going to bother with the hassle that is antibiotics unless it gets worse again.  Still, just to be on the safe side, I'm taking today off, staying inside where it's dry, and taking extra vitamin C.  Maybe I'll even use this time at home to code a page for the New Year's pics.

       It's late.  I'm tired.  I should really go to bed.  I'm not going to.  I finally finished watching the entirety of  urlLink Chobits , which is an impressive feat for me.  I just never sit down and watch DVDs, which is sad, since I have so many of them.  You might say to me, "Jenni (or Trix), I didn't realize you liked Chobits."  And I would say to you, "It's an anime/manga series about an adorable, naive computer's search for her true love.  How could I not like it?"  And then you would remember that I'm some kind of weird freak and you'd back away slowly.  I have to say I liked the ending to the anime a bit more than the manga, simply because it made a little more sense.  It seems almost like the anime was how they would have ended it if they had had time to think it through a little better.  The manga was all, "Chi  is  a chobit, but 'chobits' was just the cutesy nickname we gave Elda and Freya and they aren't actually special, that was an internet rumor," and while it seemed a logical extension that Chi's "special program" was to give all other persocoms the ability to love, it didn't seem to actually happen.  In the anime there wasn't any of that, "Oh, they aren't special, never mind," and it was clearly implied that Chi's special program  did  actually allow them to love.  Well, Dita blushed.  Only Windy will understand any of the preceeding paragraph.  I keep wanting to write an essay on the possible emerging character of the first decade of the century, but it always digresses in my mind into an argument on how vastly, incomprehensibly more artistic an approach to the subject of paternal abandonment Pearl Jam's "Daughter" is to anything Linkin Park or Staind have had to say on the matter.  I blame this on Walky, who loves to accuse me of nostalgia blindness in comparing to 90s grunge and current hard rock while he himself has heard extremely little of either.  I will also, just for the moment, cite the aggressive, blatant, and disgusting mysogyny in current hard rock that's a massive departure from the deep respect the grunge scene in general had for women.  Garbage can do a song called "Stupid Girl".   urlLink Cold cannot.   It's like how you can only get away with using "nigga" in a song if you're actually of African-American descent.  The  "angsty"  music of the 90s had a much darker, dirgier, harsher sound that anything we were used to, with poetic lyrical metaphors.  Current  urlLink "angsty"  music is just fucking whiney, with lyrics that read like a shunned middle schooler's LiveJournal.  I think the real cultural impact of this decade is technology.  While things like the internet and the cell phone and digital recording media have been around for a decade or two, we're seeing a level of accessable high technology that is leading to the age of the connected consumer.  We are becoming more like the Japanese not just in our choice of animation, but in our embracing of new gadgets and devices.  Just like in the 1950s, consumer-level technology is taking such dramatic leaps that it is changing our lives before our eyes.  But at the same time, corporations are taking over more and more.  The concept of corporate radio was unheard of until the last few years.  Lionel Richie recently said that something like "We Are the World" couldn't be accomplished now because, by the time all the test groups and marketing hurdles were successfully jumped, the problem would no longer be relevant.  Maybe later I'll have more thoughts on the emerging decade.  And maybe I'll sleep.  After Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

       I haven't really had it in me to post lately.  I had a bit of a ramble worked up about  urlLink Mission Hill  and how it reminds me of the 90s in a good way, but I can't congeal my thoughts well enough right now.  I really need to put some interview questions together for Simon, but I'm too busy worrying about whether I've had enough Gatorade today.  I can't wait until my life doesn't revolve around bowel movements.  You have no idea.  I want  urlLink 20th Prime  so much it hurts right now, but I've spent that $80 and more on doctor visits and medicine that didn't actually work and a large assortment of food I hoped maybe I could eat.  And now you know why I haven't posted lately - because all I can do is whine.  So in the meantime, have this:        Are you Addicted to the Internet?           61%                Hardcore Junkie   (61% - 80%)  While you do get a bit of sleep every night and sometimes leave the house, you spend as much time as you can online.

       No, I  haven't  been around much lately.  I've been feeling terrible.  Really, really terrible.  Worse than I have ever felt.  I've been sick for the last, oh, week and a half, and yesterday I went to the emergency room.  I guess I just let myself get a little too dehydrated, because once they put a couple bags of of IV fluid in me I felt worlds better.  But I'd like to actually  be  better at some point.  I can't eat much without it triggering another round of diarrhea.  I try to eat little things all the time, but I haven't had an actual meal in days.  The other night I dreamed about eating the best hamburger in the world.  I'm on antibiotics in case it's an infection, but if it doesn't get better this weekend (and I really don't think it will) I'll have to call the hospital first thing Monday to set up a colonoscopy.  I've missed too much work for this already, I pretty much have to drink water  constantly  to keep up, and I'm just tired of the whole thing.  I hate being sick.  Okay, I'll let you all go back to your regularly scheduled lives.  Nobody wants to hear about me being sick, but I felt I needed to update with  something , and I don't have it in me to talk about anything else.

       A great number of things happened today after I stopped gazing lovingly at my GBA SP and actually left the apartment.  It's been bone-chillingly cold here the last couple days, and gas has been expensive, so I wanted to limit my toy-hunting.  So after one more in a long series of disappointing Wal-Mart trips, Graham and I decided to hit our closest TRU and next-closest Target before heading to Walky's for the Energon premere.  That was the jackpot.  TRU had the wave-2 Energon basics, Alternators Sideswipe, and two My Little Pony TRU exclusives that I had been looking for.  I picked up the ponies and all the basics but Cruellock, who there was only one of.  Graham got Sideswipe, but I skipped him because I was already spending so much.  Spending so much, in fact, that I knew I was just going to have to put off Anniversary Prime until the next paycheck if I found him.  So naturally, that's exactly what I found at Target.  Right there on the shelf, the masterpiece, the toy that left me simply  moved  looking at him in ToyFare, the figure I wanted more than anything...and I really couldn't justify the $70.  And he had the grey gun, and I wanted to wait for the black gun anyway...*sigh*  But all was not lost, and a quick justification of the purchase of my cell phone later and I was picking him up for Walky.  Once we made it to his place I could still spend the evening making lewd comments about it!  Yay!  Energon was...really, really good.  I might spoil a little here, so you Canucks and those waiting for copies should skip this paragraph.  I always expect the first episode of a series like this to have above-average animation, but this was absolutely stunning.  If the rest of the series can be even half this good, it will be spectacular.  The CG used for the robots not only gives them a proper "other" feel, but it saves them from inconsistant art.  Not that that seems to be a real issue, as even the cel-drawn humans were well animated.  There are some elements that will clearly have to be explained later, like why Primus has become The Voice in Prime's Head and where he came from, anyway, and what the deal is with the apparently both sentient and generic Omnicons, but nothing leaves me thinking those won't be explained.  (Unlike Armada, where a number of things were never satisfactorily explained.)  Kicker was immediately recognizable as my beloved  urlLink Brad Swaile , and he was certainly an interestingly different "kid" character.  I loved the flashback to his first visit to Cybertron, with the Autobots as horrifying giant monsters.  I see actual development in the future here.  Also, I could never tell if Hot Shot was supposed to sound gruffer or if it was just him being  really  pissed at Kicker.  Though if he doesn't start with the character development sometime soon he might start getting on my nerves.  He's pretty obnoxious, but in an understandable 16-year-old way.  I was floored by their flaunting of Ironhide's vehicle-mode head, at least until I remembered Robots in Disguise's fondness for that sort of thing.  That's Japan for you.  Strongarm's voice is one I haven't heard before from Scott, which is cool.  All in all, it's got a very promising start, and I look forward to next week's episode.  Divebomb is love.

       Sorry, no new Arcee pictures.  Been too busy playing  urlLink Pokemon Colosseum .  There's something that's always struck me as hilarious about how things work in the Pokemon universe.  Ever since the very first Pokemon games, there has been at least a subplot to every one involving an organized crime syndicate in some way incorporating Pokemon into its badness.  That in and of itself is not so silly given the context.  What's silly about it is that all any punk kid has to do to infiltrate and overthrow said organized crime syndicate is to systematically defeat each of the underlings and, ultimately, the head honcho in a Pokemon battle.  You defeat one of the goons, and they just stand there, not trying to kick your ass, not trying to alert other goons, they just STAND THERE, because your critters kicked the asses of their critters, and that's all that needed to be done.  That's it, they surrender.  They just stand there, not trying to further impede your progress through their secret base, while you go and have your critters kick the asses of all their buddies' critters, too.  It's gotta be some kind of crazy utopia where the mafia doesn't give you concrete shoes for that kind of shit.  And why doesn't the police force just devote a unit to raising really strong Pokemon, if that's all it takes to eradicate this Pokemafia and stop organized crime?  Why do they have to wait for some punk kid to take care of business?  I'm enjoying Pokemon Colosseum immensely, thank you for asking.  If you've got a GameCube but somehow mysteriously never got a GBA (I'm thinking of you, Steve) and you've always kinda wondered what the Pokemon game thing was about, I strongly recommend it, because even the Story mode alone is worth it.  (Well, if you're patient you might want to wait for a markdown, because there WILL still be the Colosseum part of the disc you won't be able to do much with.)  I've been at it for about 8 hours game-time (as opposed to reset because you knocked out that Pokemon you were TRYING to fucking catch time) today and I just got to where I could purify my Shadow Pokemon.  And if you buy it at Target this week, you get the BradyGames guide for free.  And I can't knock that 'cause Sipher works for Brady.  So I got a GBA/GC link cable AND a strategy guide free just for reserving my copy at Target and picking it up the week it came out.  Boo-yah.  I'm liking Target.  I'd give a Jenni Health Update, but do you really want to hear the Continuing Adventures of My Bowels?  I'll just say that this book I got on  urlLink IBD  is really, REALLY boring.

       The upside of this  urlLink freak mid-March snowstorm  is that I finally got to take pictures of  urlLink Snow Cat in his natural environment .  Whee!  While Malin was visiting we got to write up the  urlLink guidelines for the OTFCC '04 art contest and auction .  I feel accomplished now!  It seems like it's going to be a lot of fun in that busy-bordering-on-chaotic way that I thrive on.  After finding a cheap GameCube modem adaptor at a used game shop in Cincinnati last week I've gone back to playing Phantasy Star Online a lot.  In fact, I think I'll go back to playing it right now and elaborate on it later. ;)

        urlLink I caught one of these in Animal Crossing.   I have become, quite literally, addicted to Vince DiCola.  It started when I was in Alabama last fall, when I put in "Artistic Transformations" to help me sleep.  I have trouble sleeping in a strange place when it's also dead quiet, so I put in the only instrumental CD I had with me and found that it helped rather a lot.  Since then I've put it in occasionally at home when I couldn't get to sleep.  But the last two weeks have left me having to get to bed early on a regular basis, and I seem to have become dependant on it.  The other night I laid in bed for half an hour unable to sleep, and then I put that CD in and I was out within two songs.  Maybe when we have a fan running I'll be able to wean myself off it.  I have also become a Health Food Person in the last couple weeks.  After all my digestion-related health problems, I'm trying to eat better, but I'm still a junk food person at heart.  I've started getting the bulk of my groceries at Trader Joe's, where I can get frozen fries that aren't simmering in a puddle of grease when I take them out of the oven.  Graham was noticing the last time I went that they seem to be catering to two very different groups.  They have things like meatless hot dogs next to, say, tofu, as though they're marketing both to people who just want to eat the same stuff they always ate, but healthy, and people who actually know how to cook healthy meals.  But I realized that these were the same people, and remembered my boss' observation, while playing Final Fantasy Tactics, that you really could think of people's skills expressed as levels.  Right now I think I'm probably at most a Level 5 Health Food Person, subsisting mostly on natural, preservative-free, and/or organic versions of the foods I used to eat.  My co-worker Aaron, who is vegetarian and was explaining to Melanie and me the other night how to cook tofu, is, like, level 75.  Every time I buy something outside my normal range, like when I got some salmon paties, I got up a level.  I think I deserve two levels just for eating yogurt.  Now I'm gonna go eat my Trader Joe's chicken BBQ with my Trader Joe's fries.  On a while wheat bun.  With fruit punch.  Stupid fucking intestine.

       Nokia seems to be learning, but is it too late?  The specs on the new  urlLink N-Gage QD  show that Nokia's figured out just why the original N-Gage was the laughing stock of the gaming community (especially among portable gamers like myself).  They've designed it with the ability to hot-swap your game cards (rather than not only have to turn off your phone, but open it up and take out the battery like the original model), they got rid of the unnecessary MP3 player so they could drop the price, and they designed it so you can talk on the phone without looking like the victim of a horrible frisbee accident.  But it's still not a better gaming platform than the GBA SP.  While it may have better 3D processing and display than the GBA, it's still hurt by the vertical screen and overwhelming number-pad interface, features too integrated into games from the first version of the platform to be changed in the QD.  It's still hurt by being a  phone .  And at this point the very name of the N-Gage inspires chucking in anybody at all involved in gaming culture, and that's going to hurt the QD more than any lingering design flaws.  I think from the start Nokia should have marketed this as a phone with an impressive ability to play swappable games rather than a mediocre portable game platform that also happens to be a phone.  Nokia should have pushed these at wireless stores, not at Target and EB.  "Yes, we like your insightful portable gaming reviews, but how are  you  doing?"  Well, just this morning I went to consult with my exciting new gastroenterologist, and I'll be going back for a colonoscopy on May 7th.  The words " urlLink Crohn's Disease " were mentioned, but nothing solid until they get the ol' butt-camera.  I'm getting really hyped for the  urlLink March for Women's Lives  this coming weekend, and I've already read through Gloria Feldt's   urlLink The War on Choice   to get ready.  I'm in the process of interviewing for a promotion at work to SIM (store inventory manager), and I get the feeling I have a pretty good chance.  I'm excited about that, but I'm kinda nervous, too.  I know I can do it, it's just going to be a lot of new stuff to learn and new responsibilities to keep up with.  And that's my life.  Woo.

I can't decide if it's funnier if it means "yes" as in consent or "YES!  YES!  YES!"  Heads up to the DC people: I'll be back in Centreville from April 23 'till the 26th for the  urlLink March for Women's Lives  shindig.  The march is only on the 25th, so I'll be around for a few extra days before making up for all that time I spent in DC NOT being politically activisty.

       I've been listening to too much emo lately.  I've also not been writing, which I apologize for.  I don't know why.  I don't know if I'm just still recovering mentally from being sick (not that I'm done being sick, which doesn't help) or if I've been too busy at work to come up with anything to blog about or if I'm just lazy.  Pokemon Colosseum is also a likely factor.  I got 5 votes in the  urlLink Trannies  for Best Fanfic Writer Ever without having finished a single story all year, so I suppose I'd be justified in retiring.  I just haven't felt up to writing.  Maybe I'm just too bogged down with stimulation: Here I am on IRC with a channel and two /msgs, talking to another friend on AIM, with three IE windows open (including this one) and listening to  urlLink Exciting New Liberal Talk Radio .  I think the weather is getting to me.  I haven't seen the sun in days.  I need to stop complaining and leave my poor blog out of this.

There's just something deeply wrong and hilarious about figurines of  urlLink little girls admiring their panties  or  urlLink Swan White being American  or, well,  urlLink  this  .  I'll be the last one to claim that no adults are into toy cartoons, but I guess I'm just not used to seeing a company so willing to cater to the older, pervier part of its audience.  And I'm a girl, so I can get away with it.  It's like how only black people can get away with collecting embarassing old black caricature folk art.

       I should never, ever have discovered rec.games.video.nintendo.  I went to ask for advice on charging my GBASP while in England, and now,  24 hours later,  I am posting things like this:  "purda"   wrote in message news:NWxtc.1575$IB.1435@attbi_s04... > I think that the Nintendo DS is going to screw over the PSP due to it's now > widely know features and it's backed community. Plus this is Sony's first > time into handhelds and are probably going to screw a lot of things up, make > bad market choices, and simply all around suckyness.  I agree, and here's why: The thing that Nokia has already learned and that Sony will learn soon enough is that portable gamers are a special breed.  Maybe it's because of the Game Boy's domination of the portable market for all these years, but portable game consoles are a special market that can't be treated like normal consoles.  First, you have to keep costs down - no portable gamer is going to shell out $300 for a system, and only the disgustingly rich are going to shell out $300 for something they could very easily leave on the bus.  Second, you have to realize that graphical capabilities are not the most important thing.  I still remember playing through the first GBA Castlevania and showing my boyfriend with awe how the background and foreground moved seperately, to which he pointed out that *real* consoles have done that since the SNES/Genesis days.  Portable gamers, in general, are easily amused and don't live, eat, and breathe 3D graphics.  For that matter, Third, lots of portable gamers are old-schoolers who would rather have a solid side-scroller or a well-thought-out RPG than an overwrought 3D adventure.  Most of the most popular GBA titles have been RPG/Tactical RPG games and side-scrollers.  So all this together means that the people who are interested in portable game consoles, who all already own Game Boys and probably have some small loyalty to Nintendo, aren't going to pay $300 for a system that will do far more than they really want it to do.  They just aren't that kind of people.

       Damn, I don't even know where to start...  I don't want to sit down and do a proper Wizard World East "report".  I put up  urlLink a big photo gallery , which you should go look at if you haven't already, and I think that was about all the structure I had in me.  I'll have more pics in my  urlLink photo blog  of the trip itself when I get them edited up, probably Wednesday or Thursday when I'm off work.  It was a lot of fun, though.  The cicadas are already making a racket out east; the news says they should be hatching here as soon as Friday.  For some reason I find myself associating summer heat and cicada noise on a really deep level.  I'm not sure if it's because there are always different cicadas in the summer in Alabama where I grew up (maybe someone reading this from the South can answer that) or if the last time these came out, when I was 8, just made that much of an impact on me.  It's like the sound itself is the sound of oppressive heat and bright sunlight.  I really hope this new medicine the gastrointerologist put me on isn't wrecking my concentration.  Something sure is.  Maybe I'm just tired.

       Yard sales have treated me well this weekend.  I went to them almost religiously when I was in high school, strapping on my skates or getting on my bike every Saturday morning and riding around the local subdivisions looking for old Transformers.  I found a lot of really awesome stuff this way, stuff that would have cost me a good chunk of money to buy from collectors.  I didn't even know the  urlLink Time Warrior watch  I got for a quarter was worth anything until I wore it to BotCon '95 and people kept asking how much I wanted for it.  But after a while the toys dried up and even before I left DC I stopped going to them.  Here in Columbus yard sales seem to be a less structured affair.  People have them on Fridays, they have them on Sundays, they last the whole weekend, they go until 5 or 6 or it gets dark outside.  This Friday and Saturday there was a charity yard sale by my store using one of the empty spaces in the shopping center.  It wasn't much, but I did score a fairly new Polaroid One-Step camera for a dollar.  Sure, the film's $12 for a cartridge of ten, but the camera was $1!  It's purely an experiemental art camera for me, though I'll probably snap off some shots of friends to give them.  And in another instance of old technology, today I picked up an NES system and a big pile of games at another yard sale.  Highlights include: Ninja Gaiden, Super Mario 3, Metroid, Goonies 2, and some stuff Graham assures me is wonderfull awful, like Kabuki Quantum Fighter and Low G Man.  I'm forcing myself to finish Pokemon Colosseum first, though, because I need to breed Mon some Pokemon before we head to Wizard World East this weekend.  But then it'll just be me, Ninja Gaiden, my Polaroid camera, and The Police's "Ghost in the Machine" on vinyl.

       I suppose I should let you all know how I'm doing.  I went in for my colonoscopy on Friday.  To start out with, in preparation for this I couldn't eat any solid food from Wednesday night until it was over Friday afternoon.  By about 6PM Thursday I'd open the fridge to get another bottle of water and just about start crying when I saw all the food in there I couldn't touch.  I do not do well with not eating.  Only the severe consequences of failure (i.e. not actually being able to get this colonoscopy over with) kept me in line.  I had to start taking a miserable-tasting laxative called Fleet Phospho-Soda at 7, which I attempted to mix with Vernor's to cover the taste.  It was recommended that it be mixed with ginger ale or water and lemon juice to "mask" the taste.  Those of you who have experienced Vernor's particularly strong variety of ginger ale will appreciate how bad this laxative must have been for the Vernor's to be nigh useless against it.  I took Graham out to pick up the Transformers PS2 game and a PS2 to play it on in hopes that the Mini-Cons would distract me.  Actually, once I started taking the laxative my hunger stopped bothering me so much.  Maybe it was the two bottles of water I had to chug immediately after it.  I had to get up for another round of the Phospho-Soda at 6AM, though I got to watch Armada while I tried desperately not to vomit.  Then I went back to bed, got up again at 9 for my last chance to drink anything (I couldn't even have fluids within 4 hours of the "procedure"), and caught another hour or so of sleep.  Graham and Walky both accompanied Ron and me to the hospital where the clinic is located, despite an impressive thunderstorm that hit right as we were leaving.  They checked me in and took me back, letting Graham keep me company while I waited for everything to be set up.  I'll be happy if I never have another IV in me for a long time.  They sedated me for it, and as of last night the stuff was still messing with my memory a little.  I got to watch the monitor, thinking drowsily that I had done a pretty good job with the "cleaning out" part.  I didn't really notice when they got to the imflamed part, though I did see them taking samples.  I didn't actually feel anything, but it  looked  painful: a little metal rod came out from under the camera, prodded into the lining of my intestine, and then - SNAP! - retracted suddenly, taking a little bit of tissue with it.  They did that a few times.  When they were done they wheeled me back into the little cube I started in and brought Graham back so somebody who wasn't drugged could hear the results.  I have ulcers in the lining of my large intestine/colon/whichever you want to call it.  They don't seem to be large, but there seems to be a number of them, and they're almost certainly what's causing my chronic diarrhea and bleeding.  The doctor said it's possibly a sign of a minor case of "a kind of colitis", and I presume he's talking about ulcerative colitis.  Y'know, what with the ulcers.  They're going to test the samples and get back to me with a solid diagnosis, and then we discuss "treatment options".  So yeah.  Chronic illness.  It's not a fun thought.  I have to say, though, I feel vindicated to have something certain, to have actual photos in my medical file showing nasty red sores inside the gut that's been troubling me for almost three and a half months now.  I feel like sending copies to the doctor I was going to when this started, who strung me along for three weeks, three horrible weeks of constant diarrhea and blood and pain and worry, worry more than anything, reassuring me that it was just an infection and if I'd just take the antibiotics even though they made me vomit it'd clear right up.  It WASN'T an infection.  I'm not crazy.  I'm not making it up.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know if it's the guilt I've always had about being sick because of the way I was treated when I was sick as a teenager or just that feeling of helplessness women get when faced with patronizing old white men in lab coats or what makes me feel so vindicated knowing once and for all that this is something that is a legitimate illness, that there are photos of my insides that show what's wrong with me and nobody can say I'm faking or making it up or that it's all in my head and dammit, I TOLD them so.  I know doctors are trained to take care of these things, but sometimes you just know what's going on with your body more than some disinterested old man who just wants to collect his fee and get on to his next fee, oh, I mean patient.  And even though I now have to learn to cope with something that will likely go into remission with medication but which may very well also plage me to some degree for the rest of my life, at least I know where I stand, which is better than I've been doing for about three and a half months now.  And now I go watch Invader Zim.  Woo, DVD!

       So Graham and I found a  urlLink new kitty friend  on our landing when we came home from late-night grocery shopping.  He was very affectionate and very not-neutered and sorta worryingly skinny and extremely hungry.  We're not sure if he's abandoned or lost, but it seems like he's definitely one of the two.  I put out some food for him that he devoured with the ferocity of one who has not eaten an actual meal in quite some time, and I figure if he's still lurking around the stairwell in a day or two I'll put some flyers with his picture up around the neighborhood.  And if he is abandoned...I don't know.  That's an awful lot of bills for shots and neutering, and I can't imagine Garfield would take it well, though God knows he's already facinated enough by her meowing through the door.  (Yes, HER name is Garfield.  Just deal with it.  And she's long been spayed herself.)  And she's got her own vet trips coming once I'm done paying for all  my  doctors.  I guess we'll just have to see how things play out.  Now I've got Stray Cat Strut in my head...

       My mother told me on the phone the other day that she had the decidedly awkward experience of having my creepy ex-boyfriend from high school - 6 and a half years ago dumped, for reference - pull into their driveway as she was standing out there messing with her car.  The purpose of the visit seemed to be for the sole reason of showing off the Viper he's now driving, though it's uncertain whether he meant to run into me personally or if he was really so desperate for attention that he just wanted my parents to see it.  Of course, he happened to be in the neighborhood to do this because he still lives with  his  parents.  Normally I consider pathetic ex stories to be slightly embarassing.  I mean, while  urlLink Garrison's bio  is at least as funny as anything WARenfeld's written, and rivals Echowarrior as the Munchkiniest Fan Character of All Time, I still only grudgingly admit when it comes up that I actually dated the guy responsible.  Do you really want to admit you had the bad taste to date someone as horrible as that?  But I feel I have in my defense the fact that the things that make him such a loser now - relying entirely on his parents, stalking 15-year-old girls - were at least somewhat acceptable when we were actually dating.  It's just now that he's 7 years out of high school that it's pathetic.

        urlLink Stuff like this is why I like Virgin Mobile.   Sure, I still have the same signal issues everybody else has, but no bills or contracts for them to screw up.  I started playing  urlLink Mega Man Network Transmission  today, and it's pretty fun, but I think I might give a stronger recommendation for it to people who had already played one or two of the GBA Battle Network games.  With a more RPG-esque battle system the chip system was a pretty neat thing, but combined with a side-scroller it sometimes feels like an unnecessary complication.  But I suppose if I didn't want some kind of catch to it I'd be playing Mega Man 8.  It was with great dismay that I learned that  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  will not be  urlLink out in paperback in the UK  until about a week and a half after we return from our trip.  I don't know if I've mentioned it here, but I've been reading the UK versions of the books, for much the same reason one fluent in Spanish might rather read Gabriel Garcia Marquez in  his  native tongue.  Also because I'm a horrible angilophile snob.  I've read up to  Prisoner of Azkaban , and I was hoping to pick up  Goblet of Fire  and  Order of the Phoenix  during my visit to England.  As it is, I'm considering my options.  I could bite the bullet and just buy  Order of the Phoenix  in hardcover, leaving my set unmatching or picking up a paperback later.  I could put that one off and just buy  Goblet of Fire  on this trip.  Or I could blow roughly $125 on  urlLink a box set of all five in hardcover .  Heck, I don't need to eat.  We'll see.  My saving has been going pretty well, despite the new tire I had to buy today.  No real story there, the other three were replaced last summer after a harrowing week during which I made three trips to Discount Tire Company, one immediately before leaving for OTFCC, and the one that had been spared was badly worn out.

       It's been probably a week or so since I last filled up my gas tank, so I'm not entirely sure when someone put  urlLink three   urlLink Chick   urlLink tracts  under the door to my gas cap.  Maybe they're trying to explain that the rising gas prices are Satan's doing.  I dunno.

        urlLink So these are out now, at least at Target.   I picked up Legend of Zelda, but while my original enthusiasm was directed right at Excitebike, having just purchased it for my actual NES kinda took that edge off.  For that matter, my deep, aching desire for the NES-style GBASP has been dulled slightly - so very, very slightly - by the possession and use of the actual controllers it is based on.  Still, I have to fight with the desire to trade in my trusty blue model for the beautiful red buttons and grey stripes.  If blue wasn't my signature color I'd do it in a heartbeat.  In other personal gaming-related news, Steve-o picked up Wario Ware for the GameCube as I was buying Zelda, and it is indeed all that and the proverbial bag of chips.  Today was a very good gaming day.  And we had a cookout!  It went great once the rain stopped.

       Okay, let's see...    I've got the AC in my car working.  I've got a bag of stuff to bring for friends.  I've got my camera batteries charged up.  I've got the rent check ready to go in the box on the way out.  I've got the special T-shirt I made.  I've got plenty of Asacol, plus psuedoephedrine-free sinus medicine and my nightly vitamins.  I've got a handful of absentee art entries.  I've got a notebook for writing down contact information so all the contest winners and auction people can get their stuff, and it's got tabs by subject.  I've got five copies of the art room schedule.   I've got a back-up CD of all the art show, contest, and auction forms in case the ones Malin printed spontaneously combust.  I've got to get to bed.

       On top of finding out I would need another $500 in repairs to my car to get my air conditioning working, and being told I'm pretty much not going to get this second promotion I was trying for at work (also that my co-workers hate me and I should be on Ritalin) , Friday also marked the loss of my title at work as Queen of the Fictions.  I would like to think that this was, like my loss of comics, not because of failings on my part, but Friday was bad enough already without asking about that.  Instead, I have now been put in charge of Young Adults and...Religion.  While I have been known to read the occasional J.K. Rowling or Eoin Colfer, I haven't read a religious book since sating my curiosity as to what this "Left Behind" business was about.  (And learning it was about writing to the lowest common denominator.  I had more challenging reading assignments in junior high.)    I always kinda dreaded the idea of getting stuck with Religion.  It's not that I have anything against religion itself.  Conceptually, it's fine, and I find the non-Christian stuff especially interesting in a "Let's learn about other cultures!" way.  But it's the hate stuff that always bothered me.  The fact that there even  is  a book called  urlLink "Is The Homosexual My Neighbor?"  is kind of appalling.  Or one I discovered today,  urlLink "Who Is My Enemy?" , which tells you how to draw homosexuals, "militant feminists", and even (Gasp!)  liberals  into your church so you can convince them to stop having sex with other men, putting on shoes and leaving the kitchen, and voting for Kerry, respectively.  Okay, so I find this sort of stuff a little insulting.    But I started running it today, and it wasn't really so bad.  Most of it was pretty innocent.  My main lingering concern is being a heathen in the section.  When I ran fiction, if I apologetically expressed to a customer a lack of knowledge of Nora Roberts aside from what I learned while stocking, that customer was unlikely to get upset or try desperately to convert me to reading Nora Roberts.  I wonder if any of my predecessors have been proselytized to for a lack of deeper knowledge of the subject matter.  Though I guess it's not really that much different from working any other part of the store, or any other store, for that matter.  I've been invited to churches or asked if I know that Jesus loves me while working almost as many times as I've been awkwardly hit on by extremely creepy men.  I'll manage.

       Last night I dreamed that I wanted to give everyone I work with little gifts, but all I had to give was untranslated manga and capsule toys.  I think this sums up how I'm feeling about work right now pretty much perfectly.  I want to give something, but what I have to give is neither understood nor most of all wanted.  And what is wanted, I don't seem to have.  I have a pretty uncanny ability to dream perfect metaphors sometimes.

       The Good: I got free passes to IMAX Spider-Man 2 tonight.    The Bad: The $100 I spent to get the AC in my car recharged yesterday seems to have kept me in sweet illicit coolness for all of one day. I go in at 8AM tomorrow to see if they can figure out why it stopped working.    The Ugly: I'm crampy, and I can't take anything proper for it because ibuprofen will apparently upset my UC.

       What the trailers for the new&nbsp;Will Smith sci-fi flick&nbsp; urlLink "I, Robot"   really  make me want to see, more than the movie itself, is a movie based on Asimov's "The Caves of Steel".&nbsp; I just reread that and its two direct sequals (as opposed to all the other stuff that it was also linked to) a few months ago, and I couldn't help thinking what a great basis for a movie it would be.&nbsp; Admittedly, the people writing "I, Robot" seemed to think so, too, since the plot is essentially the same detective story with a seemingly impossible robot murder of a human, just without the android&nbsp;partner and cranked up several notches on the action scale.&nbsp; I guess maybe they figured if they paid Asimov's estate just enough to use the name of one of his books, maybe they wouldn't sue them for halfway stealing the plot of another.&nbsp; I'll probably see it when it hits the dollar theater, though.&nbsp; I'm a sucker.  &nbsp;  Sunday nights are the most boring time for the internet.&nbsp; Lots of sites don't update on weekends, and even the big&nbsp;corporate news sites seem nearly comatose.&nbsp; Fortunately it's one of the best Adult Swim nights, so that makes up for it a little.&nbsp; I'll probably be heading over to the Evil Empire Supercenter later tonight to pick up the makings for a Mini-Con logo shirt to wear at OTFCC, though how much use I get out of it will depend on whether we have shiny staff shirts this year.

       Last night was an important step in my life as a geek: I learned how to play Magic: The Gathering.&nbsp; There are perfectly good reasons I never got into it when it first came out, those being 1) I spent all my money on toys and comic books, and 2) All my stupid high school&nbsp;nerd&nbsp;friends had shitloads more money than I did anyway, even if I didn't spend it all on toys and comics, so they bought all the good cards and&nbsp;it would have been&nbsp;pointless for me to even try to compete.&nbsp; The idea that I could have asked my parents to maybe buy me some cards every so often so I could be cool is almost as laughable as they idea of asking them to buy me some clothes to make me cool.&nbsp; At 14 I had to buy all my own Pearl Jam&nbsp;T-shirts.&nbsp; You know, on weeks when there wasn't any new TF:G2 stuff out so I had spare cash.  &nbsp;  So&nbsp;residual teen angst aside, I picked up some Mirrodin decks and boosters that somebody had sold my store and Steve-o was kind and patient enough to teach me how to play.&nbsp; (This was, naturally, after driving around most of the west side of Columbus and determining that there were no toys or comics&nbsp;for me to spend that money on.&nbsp; Not that they cost much after my discount.)&nbsp; I suppose the Mirrodin expansion was as good a place as any for me to step in, what with being themed around a&nbsp;metal world with lots of mechanical creatures.&nbsp; I lost both games, of course, but that was only to be expected.&nbsp; Steve-o had these elves that kept popping up that were protected against artifacts, and all my creatures were also artifacts.&nbsp; Also, it was the first time I had played ever, and he's been playing for years.&nbsp; But just you watch, one day I'm gonna win one!&nbsp; Maybe when Graham brings some of his cards from his parents' place.&nbsp; He said he loses a lot.  &nbsp;  Now I just need to learn to play D&amp;D and I will be fulfilled.

       I want to be Graham's Aunt Susan:     As further proof that I can find just about any toy if I put my mind to it, today at Meijer I got ahold of the very popular and sadly short-packed movie Doc Ock figure that I've been angsting for since I finally saw Spider-Man 2.  Now I have to dig out my Spider-Man from the first movie for him to beat up on.  For my next trick, I will be picking up the Transformers Battle in a Box set for all the non-Midwest #wiigii!ers.

       The box of tea I bought home from England doesn't have any instructions on it like the tea I buy here.  Presumably if you don't know how to make tea they send you out of the fucking country like you deserve.  It's really good, just simple Sainsbury's Red Label, but I shouldn't have it too often because the caffene's bad for the ol' colitis.  Not that that stopped me from saying "YES MORE PLEASE" every time someone offered me tea while I was there.  Today I got started in earnest on that pile of books I brought home and read through  urlLink  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  .  It's narrated by a teenager with  urlLink Asperger's syndrome  who finds a neighbor's dog murdered while on a night-time stroll and takes it upon himself to solve the crime, managing on the way to uncover complexities in his life that he had never known were there.  His autism makes for a facinating window through which to view the flaws and anguish of the adults in his life, which affect him in ways he is unable to understand.  It's a fairly short book and a quick read, and definitely worth a summer's afternoon hiding in air conditioning.  Oooo, Graham's to the first Mr. Freeze episode on his Batman: TAS DVD.  I loves me some Mr. Freeze.

       My new car stereo needs an "Emo" setting.  I find myself overwhelmed with entertainment options lately, and like a computer trying to run too many tasks at once, it causes me to freeze up and do little more than stare at a slowly scrolling IRC window all evening.  In light of my haul from England, both from book shops and Graham's Aunt Susan, who has the best house in the whole world, I have put myself on hiatus from buying any more books until I've finished more of the ones I already own.  It doesn't help that I already had a backlog of books I hadn't read before I left; working at a used book shop with a really good discount will do that to a person.  I should spend more of my time working through that backlog and less staring at this computer screen, but then I also have all those games I should play and those DVDs I really should watch at some point, having shelled out $20 or so for them and all, and I really need to edit up some of my pictures so I can get them online, and maybe there's something more to read on  urlLink AlterNet.org , or by some miracle  urlLink Warabi  has updated with more illustrated episode reviews and not more picutres of Transformers  urlLink Armada  and  urlLink Energon  characters as hot anime chicks.  So I just sit here surfing when I could be doing things that will reduce my backlog.  I just took an hour's break to read another chapter of the ass-kicked old copy of  A People's History of the United States  I've been working on for weeks (having taken about a week off to read  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , which I  really  liked).  So I guess what I'm trying to say is, if I'm not around much, if I'm not updating much, bear with me.  I've got a lot of work to do.

        urlLink Okay, who's gonna buy this with me?   I saw this new generation of Tamagotchis when I was in England, and while I was chomping at the bit to snag one, even at £12, I didn't wanna spend my pounds on something I could buy in dollars - and probably less of them - when I got home.  I am an unapologetic gadget whore; I still have three old Tamagotchis and a Digimon in a box somewhere.  But back in those days I had Sketch around to fight with my Digimon.  I'm going to have to hope for dirty one-night-stands for breeding.  Or I'll just have to buy two.  Who am I fooling?  I'll totally end up buying two.

Now I just need some local friends who will breed with mine...or at least some friends who'll stop into town long enough for some digital pimping.

       I really like Energon Tow-Line.  He's like the illicit love child of Thunderclash and Skids.  Maybe if I'm feeling cruel I could whip up a fanfic to that effect.  Coming up on my 26th birthday, and in light of all the problems I've been having at work, I have decided to go back to school part-time and learn computer programming.  My mom has been generous enough to offer to pay for my tuition and books (assuming I don't try to go to some pricy-as-fuck school like OSU), and I've started the process of seeking out information from local community colleges and tech schools about their programs.  I probably won't start until winter quarter, which will give me time to feel confident about my plans and brace myself for the work.  Computer programming is something I've always kind of envied people for knowing, but for some reason it never occurred to me, despite being reasonably clever and generally good with computers, to pursue it as a career, and I didn't know where to start learning it as a hobby.  When I graduated from high school, Computer Science seemed like a somewhat frivolous degree choice.  Even my friend Chip (Hi, Chip!) started as a CS major and changed to English.  But culture has started keeping up with technology, making computers not just a niche but a necessity, and the IT career path seems to have stabilized.  So I ask of those of you in the know: What advice would you give someone looking to start a computer programming career?  What sorts of courses should I look for, what languages would be best to focus on and which are on their way out?  Is web programming a good way to go, or is there too much competition?  What Would Mainframe Do?

       Since I'm already up and feeling pissy, I suppose I might as well start what will pass for my OTFCC report.  Being staff means I can't really do a proper one without it consisting largely of "So then I sent a text message to Malin...", so I'm just going to post about a few particuarly interesting moments.  I'll start with one that actually happened on the way back out of Chicago, which I will call...   OTFCC '04 Moments #1: Pulling Off On The Highway   We started the drive back from Chicago around 2:30PM on Monday, and traffic was already getting heavy.  We made it through Chicago proper without incident (other than me trying to desperately text Bluestreak7), impressive for a caravan of three vehicles in heavy traffic.  We were probably about 20 miles from I-65 and I was starting to fret over my gas gage when this old white Tacoma pick-up pulled in front of me, blocking me off from Phil.  Normally it wouldn't be a big deal to have one car cut between us like that, but then he started driving erratically.  He never turned his blinker back off, he was swerving a bit, and he was going slowly enough that a worrisome gap was growing between us and Phil.  As I pulled around him, Windy (who was the only other person in the car), said that it looked like he was dancing to his radio or something.  Great, some drunk freak.  I caught up with Phil, made sure Forky's Trukk of Doom was still with us, and went back to worrying about my gas.  And before we knew it, here comes that ugly old Tacoma again, getting in front of us and driving like a retard.  What's  wrong  with this guy?  So as soon as I got a chance I got around him again and caught up with Phil.  But this guy was intent on his game of leap-frog.  Spewing curses, I went to pass him again, and this time Windy and I made the mistake of looking over to see just what this guy's problem was.  And there he was with his cock out, holding it up for all the world to see while he masturbated with the hand that wasn't on the wheel, presumably keeping up with us so he could watch us in his mirror.  Fucking perv.

       Nothing makes me more disgruntled with my job than coming back to it after a weekend of being respected and appreciated for my work.  Let's take this morning for example: I've caught some of the cold Graham brought back from the convention (also, my colitis is acting up and I can tell if I had to try to deal with customers my voice would be gone by noon, so I'm just generally fucked up today), so I decided to call in sick lest I become even more fucked up this weekend.  It turned out this one shift leader who has some sort of undefined issues with me (I can't do a damn thing in that store when she's around without her telling me I'm doing the wrong thing) got to the phone first and before handing the phone over to the store manager put a bug in his ear that I had been going on about how I was planning to call off today.  Well, yeah, I did mention to one of my friends there that I  felt like shit  and that I might not make it in today if I didn't feel better this morning.  And anybody who knows me knows that when I feel sick, which is about 90% of the time, I bitch constantly anyway, and I hardly ever actually call off.  So she can take her snarky shit out of my business and learn to fucking sort.  And now I can't sleep like I should be doing right now because they've got me too riled up.  So I'm going to make some more of this wonderful Sainsbury's tea and see if I can't calm down my wide assortment of throat problems.
