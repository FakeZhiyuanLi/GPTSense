      ...is a horrible movie IMO. Saw this on Sunday at 3:20pm show with friends Veldan and Vernes (they're brothers) - very long, and boring...it goes like this. Fight, stop for a few days, fight again, stop for 12 days, two sides visit each other and are like friends what the fuck is up with that? and there were about 4 people gettin burnt (when they're dead, it's sort of a burial ritual only they burned their people when they died) It kinda got repetitive. Where did those $200 million went? Here's a tip next time you're making an epic film - hire a better writer.  5/10 too damn boring.  My day was alright though, went to church early in the morning then went to friends and we went to see Troy, went back to friends house, ate, made some music with  Acid Foundary , didn't get back home 'til 11pm. Now it's 11:38 as I'm writing this and I think it's time for some Contar-Stri

      Well, just created this thing. I have a friend who's been using this 'blog' for a while, he shall be known only as the "Neusch Wanderer" yup, thats my good ol' CS-playing-junkie friend. Shout out if you reading this (i'm sure i'll link you to this as soon as you show up on AIM...) =) right then. Saw  The Day After Tomorrow  last night with a coupla friends; Alex Walsh aka "Steve Vasquez"  Mann Plymouth 12   at about 9:20pm 'twas already dark outside (ahhh I love it when it's dark and you're going somewhere i.e. movies, party..) we bought the tickets, Tom said that we should get the seats first and then buy food...so he leads us, and goes into the wrong room which plays the same movie only it's almost over. Hahah - then Tom calls himself a "dumbass" and we enter the right room. We spot Chris Griffin.......'nuff said, get the seats towards the top then go buy food. After that Bill Hendricks along with his cool 'rave' lovin' brotha and Steve Gallian (sp???) then a few other friends come in two of which both names start with  Eric  - Yes, I don't know their last names. So, I got to sit next to Alex - he put on his Steve Vasquez persona and proceeded to make me laugh, a funny guy I tell ya. So, let us talk about the movie itself. The first hour is extremely great it is very intense two main highlights of which where the scenes of  urlLink Multiple Tornadoes hitting L.A  and a  urlLink Tidal Wave hitting N.Y.C.  - when all was destructed, flooded, and washed away the movie turned into a slow and boring pace - which was the second half of the movie. I'm telling you, the movie coulda been a classic disaster film if they extended the disastrous events and done something about that damn second half! Overall it was a fun flick, it certainly had that feel of a "Summer Pop Corn" movie and I'm glad that I had fun. We then got into the car and cruised home lotsa talking about sex ensued between Alex, Tom, and his lil' fa...his brother Brandon while Myself and Guy remained quiet observing, and listening. When I got home (about 12:20am) I got online, called up my friend, "Big V" from Bloomington, and after an hour I went to sleep. Yes, it was a fun day last night, more of which will happen this Summer, DEFINITELY!   I am sorry for making you read this LONG and probably boring entry of this 'blog' but this is my first one and I felt it was an obligation to make it memorable. Adios, Amigos check back soon for something exciting from your's truly.

      I've decided that I wanna get in shape, and I'm totally 100% serious about this. I've had enough of being miserably out of shape, having to worry about what shirts I should wear so my out of shape body doesnt show, swiming in the pool, hot tub, lake!   My plan is, neutrition #1  breakfast = salad, fruits  lunch = zone bar, or fruits  lunch = hearty meal  ---  Cardio #2  1) Run ONE mile non-stop, the other mile, walk fast, or run with small intervals of walking (Morning)  2) Run after dinner, in the evening, same as in the morning.  ---  Fitness #3  1) Pushups - 10+ (or til burns) = 3 sets 2) Situps - 20+ (or til burns) = 3 sets 3) Crunches - 15+ (til burns) = 3 sets  As I progress, I will add up running mileage, and fitness activities should become more harder.  Thanks a Lot to  Dawei  for some good advice. Appreciate it.  I'm excited.  Outie.

      Tonight, I remembered how annually, I go to  Vali-Hi 65  which is a Drive-In movie theater in Lake Elmo, MN. It's maybe an hour+ long trip, but, extremely worth it. The place itself holds a parking space of 500 cars, that's approximately 1,000+ people I'm assuming? So, the idea is; to get my friends from Bloomington Veldan & Vernes (my usual partner's in crime) and Alex (who's trip will be the first to a Drive-In movie theater) Tom, Alex's friend + maybe some other people from school.  Now, when I told Alex all about the Drive-In, he had this to say...  (Taken from a chat excerpt on June 27, 2004 @11:23-31am)   InVinCibLeX17 (11:23:23 PM): hey, i have a really great idea InVinCibLeX17 (11:23:33 PM): but WE 'GOTTA" do this StevefromPanama (11:23:40 PM): k InVinCibLeX17 (11:23:45 PM): have u ever been to a Drive-In movie theater StevefromPanama (11:23:51 PM): nope InVinCibLeX17 (11:23:55 PM): oh.

StevefromPanama (11:24:34 PM): yeah, but Im not making out with you ; ) InVinCibLeX17 (11:24:40 PM): no no no... StevefromPanama (11:24:41 PM):  how cool?  InVinCibLeX17 (11:24:44 PM): thats fuckin 60's InVinCibLeX17 (11:24:46 PM): or 70's InVinCibLeX17 (11:24:49 PM): this is the SHIT InVinCibLeX17 (11:24:51 PM): ok StevefromPanama (11:24:54 PM):  cool, we'll go  InVinCibLeX17 (11:24:57 PM): let me have some time to type this shit up InVinCibLeX17 (11:26:16 PM): Ok, basically...this shit is like...HUGE SCREEN, parking place, up to 500 cars, first showing starts at DUSK, so 9:30p, 3 movies, with breaks in between each one.. GRiLL all you fuckin want, do whatever you want, fuckin, fuck in the truck for all ppl care...lol,  InVinCibLeX17 (11:26:26 PM): 1000 people InVinCibLeX17 (11:26:52 PM): I've been to that place, omg, so many time, every summer...I FUCKIN LOVe the Drive-In StevefromPanama (11:26:53 PM):  wow cool as hell  InVinCibLeX17 (11:26:55 PM): if we can get Tom InVinCibLeX17 (11:26:57 PM): and his girl InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:00 PM): and Josh InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:02 PM): and My friends StevefromPanama (11:27:05 PM): no, just guys InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:06 PM): and maybe more friends of urs StevefromPanama (11:27:10 PM): I don't want fucking in my car InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:11 PM): so much fun InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:18 PM): naw man, i was kiddin about that InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:19 PM): but InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:20 PM): dude InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:31 PM): it is fuckin the best thing I love doin in summer InVinCibLeX17 (11:27:49 PM): its like, past midnight, watchin movies InVinCibLeX17 (11:28:17 PM): Vali-Hi 65 InVinCibLeX17 (11:28:20 PM): is the drive-oin InVinCibLeX17 wants to directly connect (11:28:55 PM).  StevefromPanama is now directly connected (11:28:59 PM).  InVinCibLeX17 (11:29:18 PM): http://www.drive-ins.com/theater/mnvali InVinCibLeX17 (11:29:21 PM): thats the one StevefromPanama (11:29:44 PM):  tight  InVinCibLeX17 (11:31:22 PM): tyhink about the drive in ok InVinCibLeX17 (11:31:26 PM): we GOTTA do this StevefromPanama (11:31:30 PM):  yep, sounds like a great idea      ----  Now, the bolded words are Alex's replies, which I calculate at a 66% high probability that we 'might' go to a Drive-In. I calculate so, because to me, it seems some people like Tom - might not go, his replies might have nothing to do with that...but I just used the calculate phrase cuz I thought it was a cool thing to say...yeah, so - This all will be worked on, and discussed. For now, I gots to pray we go. Cuz Drive-In in modern times is WAY 2 MUCH FUN.

      ..Guess where I just came from? I  JUST  got here, from Willow Creek movie theater. I went to it with Bill, and his bro Jim. The movie is a flat out 10/10, masterpiece. I believe everything Michael Moore let us know, and see in that movie. Right now, I'm kinda tired so I'm keepin' this entry short.  Bush is a baffoon.  -Thanks for the Involver mix, Jim

      I just got done watching  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  for, the 10000000000000000th time, somewhere around there, and...quite honestly, I feel depressed toward the end. This whole film has great action - but the atmosphere is depressing, mostly the ending. Yes, I believe that's great directing/writing right there, because the director succeeds in 'making' you feel that way. I love T3, one way or another. It was the film that I was looking forward to see on the silver screen, much like my aniticipation with the upcoming 5th Batman movie titled  Batman Begins  which comes out next summer in middle of June. I was obsessed with T3 before it even came out practically because it was going to be my first ever time seeing a "Terminator" film on the silver screen. Back in the old days when T1 happened I wasn't even born yet. T2, which came out in '91...I was too young for that. I was 5, back then. And when it premiered on TV - knowing how I loved the first Terminator (I was a child, but I fuckin loved that movie!!!) I was anxiousely waiting to see it!!! And when I saw those T-800's out in the ruins of L.A. shooting those laser guns...and hearing the T2 theme...I felt like the happiest person ALIVE! I was THAT BIG OF A FAN!   Ooooooh the memories, the good ol' days - I wish I could go back and experience the same thing all over again. *Sigh* But I guess, it will take some few years for scientists to develop a time machine...then, it will be the issue of money for me.  Have a good evening. =)

      Wow. I had some fun this weekend! Yet, I felt something was missing...Guy. Damn, dude - why you gotta be lazy? Tsk tsk.  On Saturday, as planned. Me, Alex, Tom, and Josh (Alex's friend) all went to see  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story  at Plymouth (same theater we went to see  The Day After Tomorrow  [5/28]) I tried to persuade Guy to come with us, afterall, he  did  say he was going to go the day before. But, he didn't. Anyways. When we got to the theater, it was sold out. So we bought tix for  The Stepford Wives , lolz and snuck into the Dodgeball room. But damn, did it suck. We had to sit all the way up front on the second row - It was soooo hard to watch the movie. You basically had to slide down the seat and look up like you're looking at the sky. Hard, my eyes hurt after that. Nevertheless, that movie was hilarious!@!!  -Now, on Sunday, I went to church. After that when we were on the way home. My mom had to stop by SEARS and when she got back she noticed our back left tire was flat and it had a piece of metal stuck in it. Luckily we were right next to "Firestone" shop. LOL. Talk about luck huh? But when my mom drove her car there, couple of meters. She destroyed the tire so it had to be replaced, That was about 3:25p. We finally got it replaced and paid $141 When I got back home. I called up Walsh, and he sent Tom after for me. I got there about 4:50p At first, I kinda thought it sucked ass, nothing exciting but later people started to come in, Bill came in, Tom's GF, and some other girl I dont know - We played Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, especially me, for HOURS. LOL. Then we went to Alex' room and Bill surfed around  urlLink No Pulse . Tom and his GF started making out on Alex's bed, for like two hours straight. Then later at like 12:20p they were about to go home but decided to make out for two more hours. LOL.   Sh...I better stop writing.   It was fun I can't wait to do something fun like that again. It will happen again on  ID4 .  SUMMER ROX!!!!

      About 1 hour ago, I got back from a gym I went to with Guy where he works. It's nice working out! I haven't done it in like a year! my heart hurt! arr. Anyways, Guy got his lisence on tuesday? i think. I wish I could get one soon - but no, mom says turn 18 so then we can pay less for insurance... *rolleyes* whatever, not givin' me my freedom...arrgh !!  Umm. Listenin to  BT - Communicate [Toksins Narcan Remix] , tight tune! can be found at  urlLink www.toksin.com  anyways, neusch also said somethin' along these lines when we played CS today "techno is like a new disco, it all sucks" - got news for you...it's called an opinion - you're not speakin for everyone when you 'express' what you feel techno sounds like. I'm sure there are people who would say the music you listen to blows cock. But whatever, dont like it. Fine by me. Could care less.  OuTiE..

      No, I've never even tried scotch - I hate alcohol. That line is from Will Ferrel's new movie  urlLink Anchorman . Today has sucked ass, I woke up at like 11am I think and watched some Cinemax, "Scarecrow" was on, a movie with Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, and their life on the road. Kinda cool. But then i went and played CS, surfed the net..bla bla bla, watched more tv, ate, mom came home @ 6pm, we left house @ 7pm cuz some people were looking at our house (it's for sale) so we had to be out. We got home and they never came, then, all of a sudden they show up and look at the house for 2 minutes and leave - that was weird.  Alrighty, I hope I get to do somethin' fun in the coming days - hopefully really soon. I'm rrrrreally bored.  OUTTTTTT.  P.S. Stomach ache, SSSSSSSUCKS

      Is this journal pointless? I think not, at least to me - I kinda like putting down my thoughts and describing my regular days on here. The problem is, noone even views it! lol. This is cool though, cuz I can look back and read this and it will bring back memories of my days!!1!1!1!!!!11. OK. So..today was basically a moviewatching day. Guy came over my house in the afternoon and we played some Vice City - then I discovered that my parents got  The Return of the King ,  Master & Commander , and  The Last Samurai  which I saw and thought it was GREAT! So in excitement I ran over to my room where Guy was playin Vice City and told him that I got the movie and we'll watch it. I made some spicy noodle for both of us and we watched the movie. Great movie, it actually made me teary eyed  more  the second time than the first time I saw it. Guy thought it was great too. Then after Samurai - we watched the last 20 minutes of  Batman Forever  on TV. After that was over, it started raining for a little bit -  Halloween: Resurrection  was on HBO. Guy watched some of that and left home. I played some CS after that aaaaaaaaaaand now I'm typing up this entry!!! WOOooHoo, the excitement!!  Out.

      I didn't graduate, but I went to it. The class of 2004 graduated. I sat with some friends on the bleachers at the gym - thats where the ceremony was. We got there at 7:30pm and already, the whole school parking lot was FULL! the police detoured us to an alternative space which was a school bus station, they made us park there. We walked over to the school and immediately my friend Guy put on his Gown and the hat and went to his group that he's supposed to be with, they gathered at the cafeteria. the group is organized by your last name. I went down to the first floor (cafeteria is second floor, but it's really the first, its just the way my school is built) So, i met with some friends, Murphy from last year, Ben McCarthy also from last year, Sean Quinn and a few other people that I don't know - but we all went up and sat on the bleachers all the way on top. The ceremony started with the National Anthem, and moved on with a Welcome from Brittany Benson, and Student Senate. MWHS Concert Choir stepped in and sang  Worthy To Be Praised  which was a cool song actually I liked it. Senior Class speakers then gave two speeches; one was  The Opportune Moment  by Sarah Martinson, and  The Blink Of An Eye  by Lana Peterson. I don't remember what they were about, but definitely about how the class of 2004 was great in friendships. MWHS Symphonic Band performed  Puszta  and School Community Awards and Recognitions were presented by our Principal Keith Randklev. The Concert Choir again performed a song called  Lullaby . Greetings and Presentation of Graduating Class was presented by Gene Zulk, former Principal and now a Superintendent. Conferring of Diplomas was presented by Roger Bredeson, Ann Bremer - School Board Members. Finally, Reading of Class Roll was performed by Bob Lohmann, good ol' Bobby, he is the Tech teacher, also a Woods class teacher - it was his last year in MWHS after I think 33 years working in school - he was chosen by the class of 2004 to be Reading the names of all the graduates. It was great. When some of my good friends got their name read, such as Kevin Olson - gosh, what a great kid, all the people I was with went crazy. After the ceremony I asked him if it felt good getting recognized, being supported he said it was Great! My great fuckin' funny guy friend Alex Walsh graduated tonight! and I'm so happy for him he is such a funny guy - there aren't many people in the world with great sense of humor. He Is Great! Congratulations man!   It was definitely a night to remember, I will  never  forget this night...it will hold a special place in my heart because It's the last time I see some of the people I will probably not see this summer. I'm so glad I went, It was a happy, and yet an emotional night for me. I am not coming back to MWHS next year. =(

      Almost spent my entire fuckin' time online, surfing the net sites like  urlLink Coming Soon ,  urlLink JoBlo ,  urlLink Nekozine  etc... and played Counter-Strike. Geez, Oh yeah I went to Guy's house for a good ol' hour and a half I think - did my  Into The Wild  paper for Contemp. Literature. I hated doing that, that book kind of depressed me. Not a good way to finish school by reading such a book. Hmm - what else? Shit, I really don't know. As I sit here typing this up I think about what in the world will I do after tomorrow which is the last day of school, and all the way throughout the summer...I mean, I really fuckin' hate it not having a damn car. If I had one I'd be out with friends every single day, I would  never  be home. But that's the problem, So if I wanna do something I have to call friends to come and pick me up. Grrr !!!1

      Yes, folks - that's what everyone heard in the lower halls of Mound Westonka High today. The Class of 2004 is officially done with school. As I was walking through the crowd I saw a lot of people hugging each other, in tears...what do the tears mean? the sign of happiness? or the sign of sadness and the fact that these people will never see each other ever again (at least some of em wont). I'd say the latter, but heavier on the sadness bit. That event made me think about how I will feel when I'm done with school in Mound, which is not next year, but  this  year! Yup, I won't be coming back to MWHS in good '04-'05 - moving to Virginia. *sigh* I will really miss all of my friends, especially Tom Wright, Bill Hendricks, Alex Walsh, and GUY! I've had such a blast during my years in Mound. Getting to know people, going to the movies with Bill, Tom, Steve G, Guy, and Reid. All of that was fun as hell. I couldn't have asked for more..(or maybe I would) This summer will be my last stay here in Mound, Minnesota - I feel sad writing this...but I will try to make the best of it by doing as much FUN stuff as possible. Whether it's going to the beach, movies, BBQ, driving around - it don't really matter = I WILL HAVE FUN, I will try to make this SUMMER the best one ever.  Only two more days left, *sigh* I feel sad. =(

      Hahaha. That's a really fuckin' funny movie! it's one of those movies where once it starts with the jokes, they don't go away. There's always something that's gonna happen next, that will make you cry with laughter (or not cry, but still laugh). Bill and Jim & I, all went to the 9:40p show. Now what's fucking gay is. They asked me for my fucking I.D. I was so fucking pissed. I said, I ain't got an ID i'm fuckin 17 years old - but she wouldn't let me in. So Jim, bought the ticket fo' me, at the other booth. Fuck. the hold-up made us miss the opening of the movie (don't know how much we missed) but anyways. The flick is great. I love the "Burn this motherfucker down" scene hahaha. It's filled with cameos. Got great jokes, and some not so great. Overall, it's hilarious and will make you laugh.  When we got out of the movie, Jim said "Let's go to White Castle" and we actually went. LOL. The one in St. Louis Park. This was my first time in there. Mmmm, and the mini-burgers, are sooooooo friggin delicious. WOW. I'll definitely be making a trip over there AGAIN! pretty dang soon! The movie does a great job promoting the place anyways. Cuz when we got there, there were a lot of peeps!  Now, I donno...but I really wanna see Dodgeball, and Anchorman again! "White Castle" really made me wanna watch those again! fuckin' good movies.

      I'm so bored...nobody calls me and asks me to hang out, Bill, or Alex, or Tom..no-one. I'm so pissed off right about now.  Right now I'm listening to some good trance though, "Euphorasm Vol. 1" by SlyOne. Still, I'm just wasting my summer - I thought I'd be doing so much stuff but all I end up doing is waking up and going straight to my fuckin' computer. Reason? = Nothing else to do where I live to make myself busy. The spot I live in just friggin blows, friends so far away, no mall, nothin'  That's one of the many reasons MOUND sucks. Arrrrrrrrrrr!!!!! I'm so pissed. >:(  So much for 'hanging out'

      Iggy here. I'll try to keep this entry short because I don't feel like typing much tonight. Just got back from Delano...saw "The Bourne Supremacy", a movie&nbsp; I was suppose to see Friday night - but plans got fuck'd up. This movie is really fucking good, and a better sequel too. Couple of things. "Supremacy" stays true to the realism brought by the original - the bad guy shoots and does not miss. Now that's fuckin real. Anybody can shoot a gun and hit a target, it's really not that fuckin hard. You don't have to waste a whole damn round to get just a shot. All it takes is aiming - a thing other big action movies ignore. This is a REAL movie and it stays true to realism, thats what I like!   The story is very good, I did not feel even&nbsp;a 'little' bit bored watching this movie. Great acting, great story, overall great. Matt Damon's my new action star hero =) [ hell naw, Arnold will remain #1] &nbsp;=). I would definitely see this again. Glad this movie takes some time in Russia =) wooo, watching the finale taking place in Moscow was just a great experience. Understanding the language, seeing all the famous spots...etc...   9.5/10 - (-5...I know the director was going for realism, its all cool, and I know it was a technique/style...but some shaky cam directing, was hard to watch)  Cool flick, everyone should see this.   Dang, this entry aint that short at all - I felt like typing hahaha.

       Today was a really good day for me, and I'll tell you why.     &nbsp;  Alright. Today I woke up at 11:30am and ate my breakfast which was a fried egg, w/ some sausage and a salad with "three cheese" dressing. I went downstairs, and played Judge Jules' Morning Show on Radio1...on my comp. Some great tunes I want to have! I then went to ComingSoon.net and found a hella good stories on Batman Begins @ Comic Con fesitval in San Diego. There's a picture of  urlLink http://latinoreview.com/films_2004/comiccon/images/cc-batman.jpg &nbsp;Dr. Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow. And here's an interview with  David S. Goyer  the writer of  Batman Begins , and  Cillian Murphy  who plays  Dr. Jonathan Crane .  urlLink http://superherohype.com/batman/index.php?id=1778 &nbsp;some great news so far - cuz I can't wait for this flick!!!!!!!!! =). I also played *Hidden & Dangerous 2* today for the first time since, like February. I suck at Multiplayer now sooo bad. I played two single player missions also. Later on, at 3-ish my mom and I went to Target and bought her a bike, cause she wants to excersize. We got back at 5, and Guy called me asking me if I wanna go to the gym, we went to the gym @ 6pm, I did some cardio, burned 450 calories, then I did some situps 12-12-12 (3 sets). Did some push-ups, and chest workouts. We left somewhere 7-ish...and G, wanted to eat so he suggested some Asian food - we went to the restaurant by Video store. He got some Mushu, and Orange Beef (really good stuff!!) and I got Peiking style chicken, only they didn't have Peiking, but there was a different name for it...although it looked and tasted like Peiking, heh it's so good!!! I just ate it and my mom&nbsp;like it a lot too.     &nbsp;  No movie tonight, but tomorrow definitely. Guy didn't feel like going today he wanted to play some Final Fantasy X. I said awwright (that was when we was still at the gym) I can't wait to watch  The Bourne Supremacy  though. The first was really cool.     &nbsp;  You might be asking why this entry is title "Great Day" well I have only one thing to say, cause it felt like it =)

      Just got back from Eric's house, Bill & I watched it there. It's a cool movie, good action, good story, good acting. Never gets boring moments. Tomorrow we're goin to see the sequel  The Bourne Supremacy,  can't wait for that. Today I woke up at like 1:30pm - Yeah, fuckin late isn't it? Ate, watched some TV, surfed the net. Then Tom on AIM invited me to go work out at skool. I went, we ran...but I couldn't keep up with the rest so I walked. Later we went working out a tiny bit in the gym. I talked to coach Humbert about signing up w/ Track just so i can get in shape. I think I'ma do that. Then at 10:50pm Bill picked me up and we went to Eric's to watch The Bourne Identity, it rocks...see it.   The Bourne Supremacy -  &nbsp;tomorrow.

      Tonight, for the first time Bill came over my place at 10pm. We were suppose to watch "The Butterfly Effect" with Eric and Steve, but Bill couldn't get ahold of Eric, and Steve didn't feel well so Bill proposed we watch it at my place. The thing is, my built in DVD player in TV didn't work...so we decided to watch some movie on VOD (video on demand) we watched Final Destination 2. Then we caught the last 15 minutes of Bad Boys II. After that, we watched Jackass: The Movie - it's hilarious. Now Bill just left my place and I'm here on the comp. Tomorrow we're gonna watch "The Butterfly Effect" someone's house, hopefully Eric will be available this time. I'll bring my X-Men Collection DVD and we'll watch that too. I love X-Men movies. Speaking of X-Men, director Bryan Singer is now directing the new Superman movie titled "Superman Returns" this has just turned to be my second most anticipated movie. First being,  Batman Begins  (2005).  What am I gonna do now...hmm well, I think I'll surf some movie sites for news and check out the Prodigy forums. See what's happening, then off to bed!!! This nite&nbsp;has been pretty neat. Thanks Bill for comin over.

      Today my mom got me an application for "Papa Murphy's" when she was buying a pizza, cuz she knew I need a job so she got it for me. I filled it out and today we drove back and I returned it. Then we went to Chanhassen. I showed my mom where Guy works @t. She went for a walk while I stayed in the car listenin to Sasha's  Involver  album. It rocks, I think it's my favorite - maybe GU 23 and Involver sahre the same spot. We got back at 8+ I think now I's here chatting to Jenny from the block. Lol she's nice. =)  Outttttttta heeeeeeeere!!!!!

      Wowsers, it's July 20th already - time fuckin runs fast and I mean it, really fast *sigh* &nbsp; I hate fast times. Speaking of which, I saw "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" for the first time in my life yesterday. What a cool movie. High School flicks alwasy entertain me and they always make me a tad sad. So yes, I basically went on a *Video on Demand* spree. I saw Fast Times, Chasing Amy - which was a bit disappointing, too much talk - Jay &amp; Silent Bob only appeared towards the end. I expected something comedic from Kevin Smith but all I got was some few laughs and a love story. Bah. &nbsp; Then later in the night about 10pm "Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan" was on Sci-Fi which was long - 3 hours, but entertaining. Although I could've figured out it was fake even if I didn't know the truth, just the acting from other people is very cheap, and cheesy. &nbsp; besides that, I aint done anything today yet, woke up at 11:33am and now I'm here not knowing what the hell I'll be doing today which blows a LOT! cuz I'm hella bored! &nbsp; Outta here

      I just got done watching this movie a couple of minutes ago - WOW is all i have to say. It's a great film and I think everybody  needs  to see it! Jack Nicholson's best film from what I've seen. It's such a feel-good film and also sad. The nurse! i couldn't stand her - I really really really couldnt stand her. How can you be possibly so fucking cold?? Dont you fuckin' have a heart? I felt so much hatred towards her. Just can't describe it. Jack Nicholson is one cool fuckin' dude. His acting in this is beautiful, so believable! The ending is really sad - aww man I feel so damn angry...dammit!!!!!!!!!!! fuck!! what the hell. This movie will make you fuckin hate nurses, if not...then it will at least make you think. &nbsp; 10/10 - definitely goes in my TOP 10

       Just got back from seeing I, Robot and let me tell you - it's pretty 'decent'.    &nbsp;  To tell you the truth, I kinda dug it! the movie isn't the greatest sci fi you'll get but a decent summer popcorn fun. It's got cliches (Cop trying to tell something, but no one believes him) but it's also got some fun action. The tunnel sequence was friggin awesome. Those two huge robot carriers and Spooner's (lol spoon) uber-cool looking Audi OOOO. NS-5's attacking his car, buncha robots die, and all - but it looked really frickin' kool! knowing that it's Will Smith, you'll definitely get some funny jokes, and there's a few here, there was a really funny joke in this but I wont spoil, expect it when Smith says he's "allergic" to something - you'll love it, and laugh at it. It's great stuff! Decent story, decent acting, some great music (I forgot this was Marco Beltrami!) and some neat looking action sequences.    &nbsp;  But it isn't the greatest film - some will dig, some wont. Me? I liked it.    &nbsp;  Fun Fact: This was the 3rd time in a row where we saw an opening movie at the same room, thats great!

      Today, while I was still sleeping, Guy came over my house and woke me up at about 12:30pm? not sure but around there, and told me he bought a remote controlled plane for $90 at some RC store. I ate quickly and showed Guy my Video On Demand option on TV, we watched the first 10 mins or so of Freddy vs Jason - then we went to Swenson park and launched the plane for like 45 mins, the plane didnt stay in the air for more than 15 seconds, or less sometimes cuz its right wing was fuck'd up. Then the plane went into a tree and stuck there so I had to go climb the treee and get it out, took about 5+ mins, hehe. So we launched some more and went home. Then I watched a bit of Die Another Day, til the part he has sex with Jinx.  I, Robot - Friday! 1 day left, (batman preview)

      ...is a really neat thing.  I just finished watching  Freddy Vs. Jason  thanks to that, It's like a DVD player embedded to your TV, you can rewind, pause, stop, resume. It's great. Saw this in theaters when it came out - I dug it a lot. Now I watched it again and I still feel it's ace. Monica Keena is hot, but a very bad actress lol. Freddy rocks for being funny - and scary. Jason is dumb, but very friggin BADASS. The rave scene is the coolest (the music rocks in it) Katharine Isabelle is a hottie, love the pigtails.  There was a scene in the first draft of FvsJ where at the end Freddy & Jason go down to hell somehow and "Pinhead" from Hellraiser movies goes "No gentlemen, what seems to be the problem" and it ends, I thought that was a cool ass ending which definitely leads to Freddy Vs. Jason Vs. Pinhead.  But right now, they're thinkin of doing Freddy Vs. Jason Vs. Ash (from Evil Dead) and as I watched FvsJ tonight I got to thinkin, "yes I think it's gonna be a great movie if they get Ash" and I believe Sam Raimi showed interest in directing. Would rock!  Outie. Time to surf for a little while, then go to sleepy =) Gosh, I LLLLLLOVE Summertime!!!

      Woke up today at about 1:25pm and flipped thru channels and Freaky Friday was on, I missed the first 35 minutes. The movie's great - I really liked it, it's a family feel good film, one thing about Hollywood I love, that they make these kind of movies. They can take you away from feeling sad and make you happy. Heh. Lindsey Lohan's hot.  I, Robot - Friday July 16 [Batman Begins] teaser

      Is my new favorite tune by  Meat Beat Manifesto  "Wooh Alright" accompanied by an ongoing bass throughout the tune, with old skool heavy echoing beats. I've heard this many times but I never knew the track name of it. Now I know it, thanks to Morbid. Nice memory dude, and thanks for the RIP too. Sounds nice on my speakers.

      Kinda a late entry but uh, yesterday I went to see Anchorman with the same group I've been going to see movies almost everytime. Alex and Tom came over my house at like 8:45-50pm about there, and both started screaming my name  so fuckin' loud. So me and Guy got in and went to Walsh's house he had to change, there we met both of his parents talked a bit and left for the movie. It was hella fun ridin there with our boys - always a great time, listening to music, talking, looking at the lake out of the car's window, nice skyline. Ok, im gettin carried away heh ;) We get to the movie theater and go straight into Anchorman 9:30 showing, we got there like 10 minutes or so early. There Bill and Steve saved us 8 seats, there were extras, all the way in the back. (I love that spot, best view)  Josh with his Girl came, lol and then Guy saw us and tried to get to us all the way from the opposite side, which was funny he tried to get thru all those people sitting, Alex and TOm were like "Excuse our asshole friend" haha shit. =)  Now, the movie was FUCKING AWESOME. Will Ferrel is the man, this is such a great time. Great fuckin cameos in that film, Will Ferrel was funny in Old Skool but here he's just fuckin hilarous!! the scene with the dog kick, fuckin had me laughing so hard aww shit. And the Retard weather man was great!! Ohh man I'd see this movie anytime again! Just love it. I suggest people see this ASAP! 10/10  - So when the movie was over we went to Bill's house cuz he's parents went to Wisconsin, with a short stop at my house so my man G could get his car, and we'd follow Alex. Cuz he didn't wanna sleep over.  We went to Billy's house, and had a fun time. Jumping on Trampoline, and then Bill, Guy, Alex, & I went swimming in the pool which was cold but really nice, I ain't dunnit in a while.  After that we went to Bill's room and he played some DDR on his comp - damn he's good.  Later, we went watching Shaolin Soccer, ROFL - what a great fuckin movie. Two comedies in a Row!  - At 3:15am we went home (Guy & me) Alex also changed his mind about sleeping over. Bah, of course, Tom couldnt sleep over cuz his mom didn't want him to. Always like that. arrr  Man I can't wait to go tubing!!! tomorrow hopefully! I love the weekends!! =) =) =)

      Just got back 6 minutes or so ago from Walsh's place. Boy what a time.  It was Alex's b-day yesterday - the big 18. Yay. At about 9pm Alex came over my house to pick me up I gave him "The Jackal" DVD and new Prodigy album as presents. We went over to Tom's place. Bill came over with his car and we went to Mall of America to eat at Hooters...but I wasn't hungry and I had a little heart burn. Sux huh? We waited some 45 minutes for the food to come in, and Alex, Tom * Bill ate really fast. We went to the Arcade which was a fun time seeing Tom spaz out when he lost the Tokyo Cop games, LOL. "Get tha fuck out of my WAY!!!" hahaaha. So we spent some time there maybe 15-20 mins? and went home to Alex's house for a sleepover.  I donno when but about midnight somewhere there Tom's girl came over. We watched some show named "Real Sex" about all these sex toys gadgets which was kinda. meh...but funny at times. I spotted "True Lies" on one of the channels and I changed the channel to that - So we watched that til' Tom's girl got bored and they got it on on da flo' ;) OK. Then they went inside the room, locked themselves and... ;)  We watched Tv, then Tom and Annie got out of the f'n room adn we watched Punch-Drunk Love at like friggin 4 in the morning. We stayed up so late, we pulled an all-nighter. We went to sleep at like 5Am and it was already light outside. The thing is, neither me nor Tom wanted to sleep - buuuut I guess we had to ;) Anyway. T'was a pretty fun night even the definition of fun was watching 3 movies lol.  So we all woke up at like 12pm and I played GTA and some Tekken. Bill left tho, and came back at like 2pm after we ate some good burger's which Alex's mom cooked. Watched some 8 Mile and now I'm home.  Now, for next fun night. Movie on Friday.. Anchorman wooo ;)

      Looks like I didnt have to wait for September 17... It got leaked - that shit happens.  My first impression when hearing Spitfire, the first track was a grin on my face I was in disbelief. Spitfire is the next Firestarter - it also sounds like 99 Problems. AONO takes a new direction sound wise. Lots of distortion very dirty. Totally different than FOTL, Jilted, Experience. It's got its fair share of sloppy trax, most are decent and a few awesome ones. For all of you out there, you'd have to wait for the release date I aint leaking this. Heheh ;)

      So I went and saw Spidey 2 last night at PLymouth, at the latest show which was 10pm movie was 2 hours and 7 mins long.   First I gotta say, great fuckin movie. Second, I was disappointed with how little Dock Ock was shown on screen. But, the sequel screams....hehe, not gonna tell which villain. ;-)  Spidey 2 is mostly about Peter Parker, and his love for Mary Jane, he cannot reveal his identity to her. He is afraid of being with Mary Jane because he will always have enemies and they would harm MJ to see Spidey suffer.  Overall this movie gets a 9/10 for not having more Dock Ock - badazz villain.  - We all hit up Denny's at 12:30am and I ordered a deluxe burger cuz I was pretty hungry.  On the way home I ate in Alex's car while we had a conversation, which was a good one. ID4 party happenin' at Alex's house hopefully, I'll try to get Guy.  Today I'm going to Best Buy with Guy. He's buying a new video card while I'll trade in some PS2 video games at Funcoland...hopefully...  OuTie!

      Hehe, just saw this puppy on Cinemax and I gotta say. It rocks. I liked it a lot. I thought it was a worthy sequel - funny jokes (i laughed a lot). Stiffler stole this movie I think, he rox so much. Thanks to Sean William Scott who made it happen. Hooah!  Nothing much for news though. As usual went to cap'ns practice and I ran a lot today, 2.5+ miles which was nice..more than what I usually run. I think having other people run with me gives me the passion to keep going and thats what happened today. I'm proud. Tomorrow whatever we're doing I'ma try and do my best.  Looks like there was no movie at Tom's house tonight, i never bothered to call and see what's up anyways. Not mad or anything, cuz I understand that his mom probably doesn't like him having people over the next day.  I really wanna see Hellboy though!!

      LOL. This was a fun night. I just got back from Tom's house, we watched Kill Bill Vol. 2. We were suppose to be in the hot tub - but didn't do it. Tom called me around 9pm and told me to get my swimming suit on cuz we be hot tubbin', but first...we went to Movie Gallery and rented "Kill Bill Vol. 2" and "Hellboy" (which we'll be watching tomor...I mean today, at night 10pm-ish) So yeah we got the movies and got to Tom's place where there were Tina and Steph (dont really know em in person) Stephanie left quickly, but Tina hung out for a little bit then she went. I played two games of Star Craft, and Alex with Josh tried to scare me behind me while I was playing but..HAHA IT DIDNT WORKEDD!!! lol. Yeah I finished kickin' ass on SC and we then popped in KB: Vol. 2 which was a good movie. While watching the movie we cracked a lot of jokes and overall had a great time. The highlight being when towards the end Axel & myself started fighting (aka having gay sex) then Tom got his dog in there LOL which was funny as hell. I love these fuckers.  Ax, u know I luv u. and Tommy also. and JOSH u foo' lol.  Lol Tom & Biology class two years ago. "Nnnnyyaaahhhhhh"  can't wait to watch Hellboy wooohoo!!  Now whea' mah Pieh!!!

      Aight, well today was kinda neat. I went to the captain's practice again and we did the warm up and stretching then went running for 2 miles, but I only ran 1 mile straight, but back was harder I walked most of the way. Towards the end I sprint though. It sucked, I was all red in the face cuz my blood went up to my head or whatever, all hot. But it was  cold outside so that helped. Anyways, we went down to the gym a lil bit and then went to Ben M.'s grandparents house, he showed us the wakeboard and the boat. Then we went to Tom's house and hung out in there, I showed them "Batman: Dead End" and 'Grayson' short fan films (both comic books) watched some TV and at like 1:30 Tom's mom got home and we had to leave. I had a good time though, already made a new friend so that's cool.  Tomorrow more practice, I'm diggin this, hard but so good.  *listening to* Tony Faline - Do What I Do (uuuh, came in with my staff, yo)

      just got done with "Radio" starring Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. I really liked it, based on the true story. The movie's a nice heart-warming tale, really 'feel-good' material I'd say, but has it's sad moments. I suggest it to anyone.  Today also, I woke up at 9am, took a quick shower and at 9:30 Tom came to pick me up. We got to school and had a CC practice. Running was a bitch, felt so exhausted - but coach Humbert told me to take it slow since I only am a beginner. Tomorrow I'm going again.

      Hey to all you night people, sittin there at your comp this late =)  Just got back from the movie theater, saw Collateral with Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. I liked it a lot. Pretty good. What made this movie stand out, at least for me and I'm sure for many others is how it was shot in digital video (DV). So, it was like watching something anyone could have filmed. It just looked very different and felt more realistic to me. Michael Mann, the director of another crime thriller  Heat  (1996) comes back with another thriller. Also set in L.A. both actors, Tom Cruise (Vincent) and Jamie Foxx (Max) deliver great performances, very natural and believable. The story is about a cab driver who picks up a man named Vincent. He says he's a Real Estate person and has to make 5 stops for some business, but when a man falls off a building onto Max's cab, the truth is revealed about Vincent. Yup, that's right folks - he's a contract killer. So, Max is made to drive Vincent to the rest 4 stops where he makes all his kills. Damn this movie is neat. I really liked how Michael Mann chose to shoot the movie in Digital - it's just so cool. The feeling you get, urban realism. His directing is very neat and I'm not the only one who will say this. He kept me interested in every scene...all the angles, cinematography, MUSIC! (really neat score by James Newton Howard) all felt right for this, and the fact that all this takes place in one night. I liked it very much and I would suggest it to people who seek for some suspense or stylish directing, or the good performances. It all has it in there.  I'd give this an 8/10. One scene, I couldn't hear the dialogue cuz it was too quiet and I didn't understand what the scene was about. (Jazz club scene)  Pretty good flick. Can't wait for  Alien Vs. Predator  coming next week!!!! Wooo, then we'll go eat after that at Perkin's prolly.

When I checked "last game played" was on 4.29.04 APRIL lol, yeah the month when I was on "Resident Evil: Raccoon City" playing spree on Star Craft - such addictive mod.  I'll be playin' Counter Strike now haha Wooooo!

      Sssssssssuuuuuup ya'll!!!! Iggs here with another entry. What I did today: - Today, my mom woke me up at 1pm...LOL, I totally forgot about the physical appointment I had. I quickly ate, a hot-dog and we went to Ridgeview Clinic. Got my balls fondled haha. So when I get back. Call of Duty is already finished downloading so I installed it on the other comp and it worked - had a few problems starting the game, but I fixed it. ANyways, Bill came to pick me up at about 9 and we went to Axel's hawz which was fun, cause we watched "The Butterfly Effect" his girl had to leave early cuz her mom probably wanted her home - but I donno what the deal wuz. So, the movie is damn good! Ashton Kutcher's acting was really great. "What th' fuck is this!??" haha had me laughing. I donno, I tthink at like 11:30 we leave to go to Denny's - but I didn't have money cuz I wasn't planning to go anywhere just Axel's hawz. I got some "Big Bird" sandwich which was delicious. We sat in the smokin area cuz it had a better table in there, much bigger. Alex payed for me I think. This was a pretty fun night, I'm glad we did all that. Today Bill & I, and hopefully Jim &amp; Guy will go see "Collateral" which I'm looking forward to. Bill, thanks for the Hybrid CD, and for lending me "The Butterfly Effect" I'll be re-watching that with Guy today. I'll burn Frou Frou's "Details" album for you.

      Few updates. Today I woke up at 12pm and I ate fried eggz & bagel with philly cream cheese. Sooo good. I watched some tv, I surfed some net...then Tom called at like 2:45, and told me he's coming over. I called my mom to check if we're doing my physical today - she said no. So, when TOm came I showed him my house and he liked it. We went to some place with lotsa gravel and Tom showed me what a 'shitty' looks like...that was fun! then we got to hs house, noone was there. So, we went to some auto body shop past the middle school. He got some tag replaced. We got back, and there was his cousin and 4 kids I don't know of, 2 are from Florida. So we tubed, for a while, then wakeboarded, then we went on another boat, wakeboarded there (I didn't wakeboard) at about 7, we got in the house and ate some good food Tom's mom made. We went down, and I played some games (Ghost Recon, Wrestlemania X8, and Rogue Squadron II) then Chris &amp; Bob came in (I don't know the reason). Then they left. Tom took me home at 10:30pm  And now, Im feeling kinda tired, headache, not good. My ears feel hot, must be the sun.  Tomorrow we suppose to do something with Bill, which I'm looking forward to.  -0- : listening to Sasha &amp; James Zabiela on Annie Nightingale show. Good mixxxx - but I feel down...don't know why.

      Ok, now this was fuckin' gay. I leave the school tennis courts with my mom, and then we start having a conversation about how my mom takes all the humor so seriousely with me. So I get mad at that shit, and dont realize i'm goin 43 on 30. So i get fuckin' pulled over for the first time. So fuckin' gay. I'm never gonna drive with my mom together again, it seems that every time I'm behind the wheel she always criticizes my driving, and it makes me really mad. I know she cares for me - but she needs to lighten up!

      I just got back home from Plymouth, we went to the 9:55 show. Well, first thing, I already knew the twist (I asked for it). So watching the movie with knowing the twist - wasn't that interesting. The movie is fair, certainly isn't Shyamalan's best work - The Sixth Sense will remain his best. There should've been more creature scenes. It did look fucked up! There was a lot of talking scenes but hey, it's a movie, it has a story, dialogue matters. Can't complain there, but M. Night could've at least spiced it up somehow, he's the genius and all! Some great acting, Bryce Howard, did wonderful. Joaquin was great. The movie's pretty okay-ish. I can understand why it gets bad reviews though. Overall 6/10 rating.
