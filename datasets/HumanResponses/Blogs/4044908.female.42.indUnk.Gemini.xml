      I ran across this article this morning.&nbsp;This really is so&nbsp;true. Unless the pain of losing a loved one hits you directly, you never fully understand the cost. I can imagine the pain because I&nbsp; lost my son&nbsp;when he was only 12-years old. It wasn't for the same reason, but the pain remains. It haunts you every day and your life changes forever. Lets always remember&nbsp;those who have truly sacrificed, be compassionate&nbsp;and thank God for his amazing grace, and for the hope&nbsp;the gift of&nbsp;everlasting life brings.&nbsp;    urlLink http://aolsvc.news.aol.com/news/article.adp?id=20040728085309990015&amp;_mpc=news%2e10%2e9

      Maybe I think too much...I thought this was an interesting article, especially now.&nbsp;With&nbsp;re-election time upon us again I have noticed&nbsp;we&nbsp; can become very edgy with one sentence or just hearing a name.&nbsp;We can think we like someone until this subject comes up.&nbsp;We hear an opinion&nbsp;that is not ours and WHAM! We are immediately trying to think of a way to get&nbsp;REVENGE!&nbsp;They are such an idiot!&nbsp;And so on... Well,&nbsp;I too&nbsp;found myself getting caught up in this and didn't like it. I&nbsp;have never liked confrontation and try to avoid it at all costs. That isn't always the right thing to do (I know) but it's who I am.&nbsp; I also don't think we should be teaching our children to disrespect others just because they may have a different view.&nbsp;We are all human&nbsp;so getting angry is normal, but let's try to&nbsp;do one thing for each other as&nbsp;Americans. Stop...Think...Realize&nbsp;we all have the right to our own opinion. This world would be pretty boring if we&nbsp;all thought&nbsp;the same.&nbsp;Then speak your view with respect for the other person. You will be given respect if you show respect in most cases.&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp;you really come across as a total hot-headed jerk, rather than making what may be a good point of&nbsp;view to share. Now, let's see if I can take my own advise.    urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/27/health/psychology/27reve.html?ex=1091678400&amp;en=00dce92668 &nbsp;&nbsp;
