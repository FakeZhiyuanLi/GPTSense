      That is a combination of "weird" and "word". interestingly enough.  so in the surplus of boredom i had, i was reading a bunch of different online journals and what not, and i came to a few different conclusions:  1. I enjoy reading about other people's lives, WAAAAY more than i enjoy reading and writing about my own. i'm not really sure why this is. but i was reading this one guy's journal and then all of a sudden a lot of stress i had was gone and i felt better about life. i think that it's kind of similar to how people enjoyed going to the movies durring wars so that they can forget about their lives for a little while and get caught up in something else. werd? 2. you know that whole kevin bacon chain effect or what not? that thing where like you're never more than 10 people away from knowing kevin bacon. (i.e. i know jane, who know's an agent in hollywood, who has a brother that worked on the set of a movie with kevin bacon..get it?). well i realized how not far away we are from people. there is this dude that i met awhile ago at the state theater conference thing, and just clicking on links to other people's blogs, within 2 clicks i was at his. and i was like WHOA weird i totally know this guy!  3. i think it's really interesting to see how another group thats similar to your own works at another school. does that make any sense? yea i think this one may be the hardest to explain. ohhh well.   so thats one thought of the day. the 2nd thought of the day i had is how fascinated i am by ear wax. does anybody know how it's formed? werd.   well i should get going i have to work now. you know, this is good for me, i can put my random thoughts in here so i wont forget about them. COOL peace out fooolks.

      Well since Kara jumped on the bandwagon of public blogs, I too have decided to make one to show publicly. And here's the inside of a crazy half asian..  Desperado. wow this song is so amazing. i always say "this is my favorite song" or "oh my gosh i love this song"..and yes i do love every song. but there's something about this song. there are a few others like it. it's one that can reach every emotion, every bone, every feeling, everything in my body. and i feel it running through me. desperado.....   You can no more seperate one life from another than you can seperate a breeze from the wind.  The human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect. That death doesn't just take someone, it misses someone else, and in all the small distance between being taken and being missed, lives are changed.   Strangers are just family you have yet to come to know.  No life is a waste. The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we are alone.  --some quotes from The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom.  that last quote sticks out to me. the only time we waste is time we spend thinking we are alone. if this is true..i've wasted a lot of time. i've actually recently tried to think differently. it is hard though. but i think so often when one thing sets us off..or maybe just me..i kind of have this dominoe effect into thinking that..i'm alone. and that nobody loves me. we're never alone..as easy as it may to convince ourselves of that, we're not. people do care. it's the truth. i would bet my LIFE that every single person on this Earth has at LEAST one person who loves them so much, that if they knew how much love was felt for them, they would have no reason to feel anything less than amazing. wouldnt it be great if we felt this all the time? wouldnt it be great if it didnt take death to realize how much we love somebody? i guess that saying you dont really know what you got till it's gone or maybe that song is right. you dont.    anyways on a more positive note WHEEEEEE!! choclate milkshakes good.

      Dear TV- At first I was mad at you because today i woke up at noon and all i did was watch you. It's been 3 hours and the only thing i really have going on today is a 2 hour soccer practice. and then i will probably come back to you. I was mad because all i was doing was watching. I was distraught by the fact that, that is a lot of tv watching. But then i realized something it summer vacation and lounging around watching tv is really what summer is all about. Thank you TV for your entertaining ways. Oh the irony. -Neil

      Spiderman 2..way better than i ever imagined. i am in love with that movie. i would marry the movie if that was possible (and legal?). however, i guess it would all go amuck when Spiderman 2 found out about Spiderman, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Friends, Britney Spears, and Chris Carrabba (my other true obsessions). it would be one giant brawl. well unless none of them wanted to marry me. wow am i really discussing having these objects marry me? well i guess two of them are people. shut up neil now, save some face for yourself.   Dear Friends- Tonight was awesome. Thank you so much for a great night, it was so awesome to see you all, each time I saw your faces I smiled. I love you all, even if you weren't at the theater.  -Neil   G'night

      so they always say "live life with no regrets". i used to think this was a good way to see things and live life. but now, i'm not so sure. i think that it is okay to live life with regrets. obviously you shouldnt look back and regret everything you've done your whole entire life..but isn't okay to look back and say "man i really wish i hadn't said that" or "man i really wish i would have been nicer to that person" or "man i really wish i would have started that essay sooner". isnt that okay?   probably another post to come soon. who knows really

      well tonight was a bump in the road for me. but i'm learning more and more things as i go on. a big thing that i'm learning at this point is that we do have control of things--i have control of deciding whether this bump in the road requires waiting a few days to fix the car before i continue, or if i just change the tires myself and get on with things. i choose get on with things. and so here is a song to say GOODBYE to all of my problems. its a shoutout from me and my girl paige, because well we say PEACE OUT to problems!    I've been waiting all day for ya babe  So won't cha come and sit and talk to me And tell me how we're gonna be together always Hope you know that when it's late at night I Hold on to my pillow tight And think of how you promised me forever (I never thought that anyone) Could make me feel this way (Now that you're here boy all I want)  Is just a chance to say  Get Out, (leave) right now,  It's the end of you and me It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone  'Cause I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies You said that you would treat me right but you was just a waste of time (waste of time)  Tell me why you're looking so confused When I'm the one who didn't know the truth How could you ever be so cold To go behind my back and call my friend  Boy you must have gone and bumped your head Because you left her number on your phone (So now after all is said and done)  Maybe I'm the one to blame but (To think that you could be the one) Well it didn't work out that way   I wanted you right here with me but I have no choice you've gotta leave Because my heart is breakin' With every word I'm sayin' I gave up everything I had  On something that just wouldn't last  But I refuse to cry No tears will fall from these Eyeee-eeee-eeees  Ooooh, ooooh Get out   lol..good times. just so you know this post is sarcasm/realism all put together.   wow, okay so things can get better. a simple few phonecalls and things are lookin' up. lord of the rings, things are lookin up. remembering tommorows a new day, things are definitely lookin up.     only a few minutes till tmw. peace out today.

      Oh the consequences (both good AND bad) of a job at a coffeeshop.  this morning i woke up at 4:15 AM to be at work at 4:40 AM. As i rolled out of bed i seriously considered muttering a string of profanities to express my extreme discomfort. i took a warm shower,that really felt like it should last forever, was instantly cut short, remembering i had to be at work oh so soon. i finished getting ready and took of for work. it was still dark out. i was still mad. still angry. and still wishing i was at home in my warm bed waiting for my body to wake up on its own.  but then....  i was driving down brookwood when i seemingly found "inner peace" in the morning's tranquility. i was no longer upset. and all other problems that had been, even from previous days, faded and all i could focus on was the road in front of me and the dark black empty sky that continued on to forever. a total of 2 cars were on the road that i saw on my way to coffeerush. they both added to my contentment and as i passed them i imagined their own sense of serenity.   i stepped out of my car once i got into that parking lot, the air felt crisp and fresh and cool, and i felt prepared to take on the day, roll with the punches, and laugh at life's attempts to bring me down.  and now finally at the end of the day, from waking up so early, at 11:13 on a summer night, when most kids are just beginning their nights, i am so exhausted that i am going to sleep right now. but this is not a bad thing. i am excited to crawl into my bed, let my head hit the pillow, sort out the days events in my head, and drift into that place where everything just seems to fade away.    and then tommorow will begin. a new day, a new day.   g'night folks.

      because there is nothing currently on my mind that is worth posting, i instead give you a compilation of moments from the greatest show that we have yet seen... I give you  "Friends"  Phoebe: If you buy a mattress from Janice's ex-husband, isn't that like betraying Chandler?  Monica: Not at these prices.   Rachel: I use my breasts to get other peoples attention.  Monica: WE BOTH DO THAT.   Rachel: Hey, just so you know: it's  not  that common, it  doesn't  "happen to every guy," and it  is  a big deal.   Ross: How's Monica?  Phoebe: She's calmed down a bit. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.  Ross: How's the hair?  Phoebe: I'm not gonna lie to you Ross. It doesn't look good.  Joey: Can we see her?  Phoebe: No, your hair looks too good. I think it would only upset her.  Rachel: Oh.  Phoebe: Ross, you can go on in.   Ross: Every week a TV Guide is delivered to Joey and Chandler. What is the name on the magazine?  Rachel: Oh it's Chandler Bing. Him. Right there.  Monica: No.  Ross: Actually the correct answer is "Chanandler Bong"  Chandler: Ms. Chanandler Bong.   Ross: What is the name of Chandler's father's all male burlesque review?  Monica: Viva Las Gay-gas.  Chandler: Unfortunately, that would be correct.   Ross: What? No. What - what are you doing? GET OFF MY SISTER.   Minister: Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...  Ross: I Ross...  Minister: Take thee, Emily...  Ross: Take thee, Rachel... Emily.   Phoebe: They don't know we know they know we know.  Chandler: Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in High School?  Joey: No. I had sex in High School.   Monica: Fine! Judge all you want to but,  [points to Ross]  Monica: married a lesbian,  [points to Rachel]  Monica: left a man at the altar,  [points to Phoebe]  Monica: fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  [points to Joey]  Monica: threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire,  [points to the box Chandler's in]  Monica: livin' in a box!   [Ross enters, after just getting engaged to Emily, Joey hums the wedding march] Joey: dum dum dum dum--- Phoebe: Oh the Olympics..  Rachel: All right this may sound a little hasty, but just go with it. Why don't you and I get....married?! *haaaa*  Oh Friends..and those are only like..a one part of the infinite comedy that is..Friends. AHHH!!  g'night.

      i've been doing some thinking these past few days. and it a sudden thought startled me. well it didnt really startle me, but it did create some sense of "hmm..i never thought about that before" but i was thinking to myself, everything, and i mean EVERYTHING that occurs to me--whether it's good, bad, happy, sad..a new friend here, a bad grade on a test here, a fight with my parents, a special kiss from a girlfriend--it matters on such a small scale. it's like..everything that happens to and around me is one drop in a monsoon. one star in the galaxy. i live in frickin' hillsboro, OR. but even on a larger scale..this thought potentially robs anything of syndicated value (i'm not quite sure what the word 'syndicated' means, but it felt right, so go with it). For instance, a wedding..a wedding is literally nothing. there are thousands of people married. and to those people, the bride the groom the friends the family, it is such a huge life changing event..it literally feels like the whole world such stop in its tracks and watch the wedding and be genuinely excited for the couple..and yet the world continues turning, not even giving a minute's notice to this huge even. do you read the obituaries? on occasion my mom and i sit down and read them..not to be morbid..but because we've both agreed that people should take time to give a moments thought to those who have passed on whether we know them or not. as i sit there and i read them, i do get some sense of sadness for the person and their family. but to those families, i cannot imagine the intense amount of grief they feel. and i barely even get a crumb of that. it's bizarre to me. although..i was reading my book (the 5 people you meet in heaven) and it talks about this..and i think that i really agree with it..that everybody is connected. that is why we are all so drawn to birth and to death..it is something that whether conciously or unconciously evokes some sense of emotion out of everybody. our bodies, our souls, our spirits, they know the deep lying roots of humanity, of our true purpose here. we   are    all connected..strangers are friends we have yet to meet (also a quote from the 5 people you meet in heaven).   i think thats it for now. i'm tired and am participating in a looooong run with a beautiful girl that i am so lucky to have in my life. the long run with the hot sun will all be worth it because she will be by my side. i love you miriam.  g'night, sleep tight, dont let the bed bugs bite (because they give you herpes)

      just some random thoughts...  i forgot how hard running is. especially in extreme heat. it is butt hard. although, sweating and that feeling of exhaustion feels good. i like it. that which does not kill you, can only make you stronger.  i want to go to the record store. there is nobody to go with. and it's sad......  i've done all that i can possibly do. and in response to that, from one of the greatest movies of all time "That'll do pig..that'll do" yes babe. yes.  the big gulp theory is true. prove me wrong.   some choices are really hard to make. and that just plain sucks.  yep. thats whats on my mind for now. probably more laterr. who knows really?

      well okay i have to leave for work really really soon, but i wanted to write down my dream before i forget it, so if this post seems to end abruptly it's because i left for work.  anyways, so this is how my dream went.  i was a servant in this giant, nice house. it was definitely set in the past..because everybody was dressed in old time clothes..circa 1900's? i was younger than i really am, like maybe 12 or 13 perhaps? i was scrubbing the floors, the were a dark wood. the woman of the household was in the kitchen cooking up something that smelled really good. the man of the household was at his desk writing a letter of some sort. there came a knocking at the front door. the man got up to get it. he was instantly pulled out. the glass of the door was the kind that you cant see through.    okay i have to go to work now but i think this is enough to spark my memory when i get home! be back laterrrrr

      yea i know that it's lame to put up song lyrics in your blog..but contrary to popular belief it's still okay! you know i guess i just made a judgement didnt i. hmm..maybe it's not lame or viewed as lame. okay time to shut up neil.   We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes Get a job you f***in' slob's all he replied   God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues Then you really might know what it's like   Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love He said don't worry about a thing baby doll I'm the man you've been dreamin' of But three months later he said he won't date her or return her call And she sweared god d*** if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his b**** And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the doors They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore   God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose Then you really might know what it's like   I've seen a rich man beg I've seen a good man sin I've seen a tough man cry I've seen a loser win And a sad man grin I heard an honest man lie I've seen the good side of bad And the down side of up And everything between   I knew this kid named Max He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs He liked to hang out late at night Liked to get s*** faced And keep pace with thugs Until late one night there was a big gun fight Max lost his head He pulled out his chrome .45 Talked some s*** And wound up dead Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain You know it crumbles that way At least that's what they say when you play the game   God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose To have to lose...  -Everlast "What It's Like"   all right i'm out for the night. might post again later..but then again maybe not.

      why is that, no matter how hard we try and change something..some things just will never change? why is it that the things we hate the most about ourselves..are the things that always seem to show? why is it that no matter how firmly one person believes in one thing..to another it is completely the opposite? why is it that we cant all get along..or not even get along..why cant we all tolerate each other? why in God's name do we consider some people better than others? how is it that we can completely switch emotions in a heartbeat? why do some people's opinions matter so much?    interesting stuff eh? well..as much as life can get ya down, you gotta try and enjoy it right? well i'm gonna go and try and get my self up! hope you all have a great night! i love you guys!

      i'm a little stressed right now. and it's over stupid silly things. but i am stressed none the less.  stressful situation #1: i cant remember if i locked one of the windows last night at work. yea that would be really bad. most likely fire-able. but then i keep telling myself..dude you'd hear the cars outside, you probably just shut it and it's just become so natural that you didnt even think about it. work in general is stressful right now...however it's weird because work is one thing that i love a lot right now. who knows.  stressful situation #2: i've misplaced these free service coupon things for my car. and my dad is mad. and i am mad at myself. and i cant remember where they are. and there were a ton of them. so i just lost a lot of "money" for my car. BAH neil BAH.  stressful situation #3: i really really miss kara and andrea. simple story, but stressful on the heart.   stressful situation #4: melody left for college yesterday....cant really talk about it without getting worked up.  yea those are the accumalation of my stress right now. and you know, looking at it right now i feel a little bit better. i also keep telling myself ya know "hey..5 years down the road, it wont matter" my aunt always told me that. and it's really true..how many things, honestly, how many things will matter 1..5..10..30 years down the road? few to none will. i dont know. WHEEE!   on the plus side..today = sauvie's island (nude beach perhaps?) and thurs and fri = total relaxation and fun at the beach. wow..summer really knows how balance things out. yay.

      i know it's hardcore time when i have so much on my heart and mind, and yet the words completely escape me when i want to be able to get it out.   family- no i'm not about to become the next teenage cliche and rant and talk about how much i hate my family. quite the opposite..i love my family. i love my family so much i cant stand it. my mom is so awesome and free spirited. my dad inspires me everyday and always makes me laugh. my brother is my best friend, and i love him so much i cant stand it sometimes....but then i always find myself asking myself..what have they done for me? yes, of course they provide everything, they do. they provide my clothes, they provide me with a loving household, they provide me with comfort..yes they do. but there is this "thing" that cannot be named that occurs with the rest of the members of my family that does not occur for/with me. i've spent tons and tons of nights home alone..wanting to be with my family but they want to isolate me from this "thing". where are they when i need them? they dont even know the names of most of my friends. one of my parents has actually wished that somebody else was their son and said that to my face. i feel like i have let them down..by every poor decision i make and God knows i've made millions. i feel every grade lower than an A is letting them down, every minute i'm not at home i'm hurting them, every time i just...do something i know is not okay with my family i hurt. and yet..they do something that whether they know it or not is crushing me.   friends-i've never felt so..alone, no not alone, so..completely isolated? completely seperated, yes separated from my friends than at this point in my life. i feel like..theres nobody left in this world i can talk to. yes, there are people who relate to me, but i dont feel there are people who i can completely be who i am around them and show exactly who i am to them. i feel like..around every group of people i'm with at the core base, i am neil. honestly, so dont think that i'm this different person blah blah blah crap, cuz thats not it. when you etch away the surface, i'm still neil all around. but it's like..i edit what is said around certain people. i edit what is done around certain people. i allow myself to feel certain things to certian people. does that make any sense?   something i'm realizing is that it IS okay to be alone. a strong sense of self and independence is something that should be valued and cherished, and a time in life that is practially handed to me to find that, should be something i should treasure.   yes..perhaps it is time i grabbed the bull by the horns and find out exactly who i am and what i am. i have a year left before i go out into the world, a year before who i am is tested, a year before i am stripped of all previous knowledge of who i am, a chance to start fresh..who will that person be?   i really dont know what i'm saying right now and i'm really tired. so i apologize for those of you who actually read this. well i am going to go now bye.

      i think my stomach is permanantly sore from laughing so hard.   i just watched the footage i have from graduation, and the things michelle and i do are really..bizarre.  but  (to me at least) very humorous.   michelle, thanks for the years of laughter.   hey, to anybody at all that read this thing--do any of you know how to post pictures from a dig. camera, or any picutres at all?  off now to continue my plAN (still need toothpicks...MUAHAHAHA!)

      man..the thoughts in my head right now amaze me and leave me empty, not in a bad way, but just empty without answers without emotion without reason.  time changes everything. everything changes. true, right? i know i have changed, i know i have. but as i sit here and i reflect on life, i feel like everything around me, perhaps isnt changing, but is moving so fast and i am standing still, stuck in one point and forever destined to its residency. i see people falling in love, i see people falling in hate, i see people becoming best friends, i see people becoming enemies. all the while, i sit merely an audience member in this huge world. i'm in awe. i feel disconnected somehow, but again not in a bad way.   it makes me sad the way some things are changing. there are some people, that i wish to grab hold of, take their hand and look at them and say NO! please dont leave! dont go! dont change! please, stay here right here in this spot where things dont move so fast, and we can change and grow at a slower pace! ...but life is funny in that, we ourselves can only live for ourselves.   things do change, but there is something that keeps my heart at peace. no matter how things do change, the memories of that which once was, continue to live, deeply rooted in my heart and supplying hope when i feel lost.  even when i am lost, i have realized one thing: i'm still here. it's been hard for 17 years, and i am only SEVENTEEN years old, and i feel like it's been a lifetime! but i am still here. things have been hard, life has dealt its cards to me both good and bad...and here i am still here taking in every breath.   whew.   hmm well i think i'm going to bed now. adiossss

      i just now got home from graduation. i'm exhausted both physically and mentally. i've cried tears that i didnt want to cry, but tears that came out none the less. i've had my heart tugged back and forth from complete love and happiness to hollow remembering the friends that i am losing. i feel like this huge piece of my heart is missing now. i'm just going to write a few things to a few people who will probably never read this but i just feel i have to get out:  jenni peden- jenni thank you so much for what you have done to me. whenever i saw you jenni, you always said hi to me and gave me a hug and were genuninely happy to see me. you made my life so much better. each hug you gave, each smile you gave, each "hey neil" made my heart grow to love you so much more each day. next year i'm going to be so lost without my "asian" friend to share a laugh with, or go to DC with or just get a hug from. jenni you made me feel like i mattered in this world, thank you jenni peden, from the bottom of my heart.  joshua sawtell- i didnt get a chance to see you tonight josh and that sucks to the umpteenth possible integer. josh i truly feel so blessed to have you a part of my life. josh i feel like no matter what circumstances were happening in either of our lives, no matter if we hadnt talked in years, no matter if i had made you hate me with all your heart..if i needed you, you would be there for me in a heartbeat no questions asked. thank you josh. you've been a faithful friend through my highs and my lows. i've never felt anything less than an amazing best friend out of you josh. thank you joshua sawtell, from the bottom of my heart.  melody nelson- melody...you were the reason i cried tonight. melody you are so many things that i need in my life..you are my humor, you are my shoulder to cry on, you are my person i can vent to, you are my everything. when the hold world has walked out..i know i always have a friend in you. i cant believe i wont have that person that..i was obsessed with the bball team with, that person i talked forever with on jennifer's roof, that person i went to dashboard confessional with TWICE, that person i could laugh hystericaly to the point of tears, that person i could turn to when i felt the lowest of the low. i dont know wheere i'll be next year without you. you've made the world a better place for me to live in melody. i dont know how to say everything i want to tell you, everything that i have to say from my heart. there is this overwhelming amount of love that i have for you melody. and words could do it no justice. thank you melody nelson, from the bottom of my heart.  ryan pedersen- ryan..god knows we've had our share of ups and downs. ryan i love you man. i've said it before..take away everything that's happend..get down to the root of who you are and i know that love is the deepest seed planted in your heart. you've shown nothing but that, and it inspires me. i've looked up to you and respected you for so long. you've come so far ryan. i miss the days where we used to talk about everything..but things happen and change for a reason. i know that you are happy right now ryan, and i am so happy for that. keep the things in life that make you ryan..you deserve happiness so much and i am so glad that you have found it. thank you ryan pedersen, from the bottom of my heart.   members of freaks and geeks- yea i'll tell you how much i love you guys in person. but a brief note..you guys more so than ANYBODY have really shaped me into who i am. thank you members of freaks and geeks, from the bottom of my heart.  oh my gosh. i could go on and on forever about the class of 2004. just fyi if you're not on here. that doesnt mean anything please dont feel like i care less about you..thats not it at all. and hey if you need a pickmeup im me or call me or email me..and iw ill go on and on about how awesome i think you are. cuz class of 2004..hell every single person who reads this most likely..i love you guys, you have made my life so much better, and i would not be who i am today with you.   to the class of 2004- good luck..you'll always have a special place in my heart..and will always be in my prayers and thoughts. thank you for the years of nothing but good memories. i love you all.  to my class, the class of 2005- get ready guys..we're about to go on the ride of our lives. lets make it the best one yet.  to all others, graduated or soon to be- make everything you do special and mean something. take something away from what you do. get ready kids..cuz soon you'll be here.    i love all you guys so much, and if you ever need anything please DO NOT hesitate. good night and god bless.

      it's been awhile since i've posted. although i'm pretty sure it wasnt missed, i think it's quite possible that the only person who actually reads this is kara. and me of course. and i think maybe sometimes monica. but that is okay. so here we go with the thoughts of the day:  i brokeout today. no i dont mean figuratively or symbolically. no, i mean i my face broke out and was covered with acne today. you know, i try not to be vein and care, and for the most part i dont. and today i looked in the mirror and i saw all the pimples smiling at me and i was like eh..well not much i can do, and so i went on with my day. the unfortuante thing is, i hate it when acne hurts. i really honestly dont care if its on my face. well i mean it's preferable if it takes residence somewhere, else, such as say, my thigh, or hey not even on my body, but things could be worse. but when it hurts, that is just the pits. elizabeth once said something really inspiring to me: "Jesus is more faithful than acne"..thought prevoking isnt it?  kara and andrea are leaving on saturday. tomorow is our last day to hangout just the three of us. i feel like this is a taste of what next year will be like. i think that we will all end up going seperate ways once go off to college, not as in from each other, but as in where we go to school. so i think this is good practice for me. or something like that. however, that does not take the suck-factor away from any of this. no not at all. however, i do have an awesome girlfriend that i will get to spend even more time with and i cant wait for that.  speaking of which, i have to say i think that i'm dating quite possibly the best girl for me in the entire school. i love miriam. miriam if you read this, thank you for everything you do. even just being. because even if just see you walking, my heart is filled with happiness.  okay whoa sorry, i hate it when people go off on tangents about their love life, and i was about to become that. SORRY. well right now it is 12:37 AM and i still have about 2 hours left of homework to do. school is fun. but not really actually.  melody wrote something in my yearbook that i thought was pretty cool: To be able to see a rainbow you have to endure the rain. i like that. even though it's kinda girl-ish it's a pretty comforting thought.   i honestly have no idea what the point of this post is anymore.  something i've been pondering a lot lately: this idea of karma. well not really karma, but well yes i guess karma. i've been finding myself thinking that well if i do this bad thing that i will enjoy, then a bad thing will happen to me--what goes around comes around. and i find it to be true. however, i really dont know if it's one of those things where i find it because i'm looking for it, or if it is actually happening.  weird.  i also think it's weird how time can change things. really bizarre. you know what? i used to really not be able to stand devin mcnichol. i really didnt. i'll be honest, i think i was pretty dang jealous of him. but now, D is one of my best friends. i love the guy and trust him completely. ironic? definitely.   on the contrary, a lot of people that i used to really love a lot and respect immensely have slowly dissenegrated into people that relaly dont matter to me, and while i still love them..they are not as important part of my life anymore..  i'm reading htis book and it preposed that all people, no matter how wonderful they are, are only truly interested in whats best for them. something i will be thinking about these next few days.  i should probably return to my english/tok homework now. farewell, oh i think people really should start using htat more. it's such a nice way to end things. i hope you fare well. see isnt that pleasant?   NEIL

      actually another change. i was just joking about the starting line's playing favorites. the ACTUAL song that goes on the list is "best of me" which ironically enough, i'm going to post the lyrics for and explain some things afterwards. WHEE   tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone the worst is over you can have the best of me we got older but we're still young we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up  here we lay again on two separate beds riding phone lines to meet a familiar voice and pictures drawn from memory we reflect on miscommunication and misunderstandings and missing each other too much to have had to let go  we turn our music down and we whisper say what your thinking right now tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone the worst is over you can have the best of me we got older but we're still young we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up  jumping to conclusions made me fall away from you i'm so glad that the truth has brought back together me and you  we're sitting on the ground and we whisper say what your thinking outloud  tell me what you thought about when you were gone and so alone the worst is over you can have the best of me we got older but we're still young we never grew out of this feeling that we wont give up   i need to make a public apology to my best friend. kara anne girod. i am so sorry for everything that we've been through this year. i think this song has a part that i really want you to know..the worst IS over..and you can have the best of me. i'm here now as your best friend and i'm sorry for everything. i'm really ecstatic (i wish i could use a big fat SAT word to make myself sound more intelligent) that we're past our epoch of decline and have had our awakening. we're on a good road now. YESS!  i had a really bad day today and then a really good day today. i think it's weird how things can even out. spencer's graduation party was today..and it made me really sad. i really like spencer gotter a lot, he's a really awesome guy and an even better friend. i think that i will definitely have to spend some time there this summer. i then got the honor of hanging out with the best girl around here and the best friends around here tonight too. it was great times.   you know life is really like a rollercoaster. even when it's down, you still have the up to look forward to. right? right.  i'm really tired and i'm sorry if this doenst make any sense to anybody. WHEEE!!   well i'm going to go now..i have to be at work at 7 AM tmw..BOO but yes for the CASH$$. g'night you crazy kids.

      after much thought i've decided to take off magicstick off my list of top 5 (or is it 10?) songs.   so that leaves us with Desperado by The Eagles.  I've also come up with two more additions to my list.    "Playing Favorites" by The Starting Line-the acoustic version "Thriller" by the king of pop himself Michael Jackson.  songs in current consideration: "Summertime" by (correct me if i'm wrong kara) Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong "Buffalo Soldier" by the reggae king Bob Marley "Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman   Hmmm...music is good. yes music yes. look at music go.  i just finished taking the SAT's today. it was..really not fun. i mean it wasnt awful because it wsa so hard, it was difficult yea, but the thing that really got me was how intensely boring it was. 3 and a half PLUS hours in one room. not able to talk. able to move for a total of 6 minutes. no food. no water. and if i smoked, no smoking. it was so horrific. it was kind of how i imagine hell being. it sucked sucked sucked.  you know i rant and rave a lot about bad drivers but again i had not one, not two, but three encounters with the same thing. i was driving down tv hwy going 47 mph, 2 miles over the speed limit--so i'm not going all that fast. and THREE cars pulled out in front of me. and they didnt speed up. it irritated me so much! i wanted to be like..what are you doing idiots?! seriously. it enthralled me. i was irate. because..seriously you DONT do that. you dont look..see a car coming rather fast..and then decide to go anyways and act like you own the world.  whoa, calm down neil. you know if i wasnt a selfish person as well, i'd be totally okay with that and let them in. yea..the car is becoming an angry place for me and i should fix that. definitely.  well i gots to get going..i'm going to see kara and andrea's recital in a little while and i have to get something to eat. hope the day is treating you well if you read this/when you read this. ADIOS!

      few random thoughts going through my head right now:  do you know what i hate? when you're driving and you see a light thats green, so you start to speed up, careful not to go too fast, but as soon as you get within reach, it turns yellow on you so you have to stop. i want to yell at the light and say cant you just let ONE more car through?! idiot. then when i sit here and think about it i just get even more mad at myself for getting mad at..a light..wow thats stupid. but i'm sure we've all been there. at least i hope we have.   i think that i have spent the year trying to impress people and be friends with people that when i reflect back on it, i have no clue why. i think i neglected the people that are really awesome and who love me a lot in exchange for stupid people who really only want whats best for themselves. i dont know. i'm a little down right now. most likely if you're reading this you're a good person, the good one. actually you defintely are. but do you know what i mean? it's just like you look up to somebody so much and you want to be friends with them, that you go out of your way to do so, but by the end of it you realize that no matter what you do, you'll never be what you want to be to that person. does that make sense? i dont really know what i'm talking about. aside from a few bad apples though, i have to say i have the world's most awesomest friends ever. thanks guys, you all mean a lot to me.  i wrote my creative paper for ms denny's class and *gasp* i actually enjoyed writing it. yea..crazy. i ENJOYED english? ms denny's english homework? crazy stuff.   i'm so excited for summer. i can literally taste freedom. elizabeth daniels said something to me today that i've taken to heart. you have to try everything once. (everything within reason i.e. no having drinking yourself to the point of alochol poisioning..etc) and so this summer, i'm not holding back. i'm going to take chances. i'm gonna make mistakes. i'm going to just let myself go! it'll rock. it's sad because the 2 people i spent my summer with last summer will be gone for the first month. but hey..i still have the most amazing girl to spend my summer with MIRIAM MCSPADDEN ..cant think of a better way to spend my time then with a girl that i could just sit with in silence and be content with. and there are a lot of fish in the sea to hangout with aside from those who venture to say..new york for a ballet workshop. i dont know who would do that kinda thing?   this is becoming a long entry. i'm tired now. i think i'm going to make a few phonecalls and then hit the hay. do you guys ever use that expression? hit the hay?  because yes, i am a needy person, if you do happen to read this, could you comment? it makes me feel better about myself. and you know even if i check back on this and there are still 0 comments i will continue writing because..well..those with ADD need a place to put there random thoughts down on.   good night. i love you all. especially one girl in particular..

      a list of teacher's i realy incredibly a lot respect ms erwin ms denny ms cea  mr miyama sil mr coleman ms dunbar dr hellman and...well i think thats about it right now. OH ms saacks is realy great. i wish i could have every teacher at hilhi. i miss coach keck. this post is lame so far.   hmm, so we did this thing in TOK where we had to talk about different things that awaken our senses to different memories. i think it's really weird how that happens. you smell one thing and BAM you're back last summer. my example: this kid just walked by and whatever he's wearing (deodarant, detergant, cologne..good hygeine perhaps?) really smelled a lot like the houses that we worked in at the street of dreams this past summer. and then all of a sudden i had all these good memories flash right in front of me. our brain is quite a unique thing..it can recall so much for all the different senses. it's so freaking weIRD.   in less than 10 days i'm going to be a senior. it's a freaky thought. i really cannot believe that i've been at hilhi for 3 years. it feels like it's been..well not 3 years. also..man i'm going to miss the seniors that are leaving SO FREAKING MUCH. i dont know what i'm going to do without a lot of them..a few of them have become my very closest and best friends. and i feel like they are literally just being ripped away from me. you know, i used to think that time erased things. but i think more than anything people erase things. people erase horrible events from the past from their minds, they erase dreams for reality, they erase other people. i dont know..i just hope that i can keep in touch and stay close with the ones that are leaving that really mean a lot to me. because at this very point in my life..they mean more than they know. werd. WERRRD WERRRD!!   hmm the bell is going to ring soon. so i'll probably update again later tonight.  I HAVE THE DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL CONCERT I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED! CHRIS CARRABBA IS HERE! YESSSS! tonight is going to be one of the best nights of my LIFE!  i love you all. :)

      2 thoughts that passed by not too long ago down highway 26(hahaha i made  a funny):   do you know what is a quandary for me? whether or not to eat healthy and to excercise/be in shape. because when i sit there and i think about it..well we're all goin' to the same place in the end, and hey..why not enjoy the scenery?(aka...FATS SWEETS ALL THAT STUFF AT THE TOP OF THE FOOD PYRAMID!) honestly..is it really that bad? along those same lines..i see people at the gym and they're all faked tan and incredibly in shape..and i just want to say to them do you know what? we will all look the same when we are 80. old and wrinkly. i dont know. although, i have to say, i'm really excited to be old. old people are very hip.  second thought of the day is, do you know what is one of the best feelings ever? the feeling of climbing into your bed and falling asleep. it's weird..as a kid i hated going to bed, and sometimes i still do. but then on very weird days i actually get excited to go to bed. it's what i look forward to. bizarre. i blame IB.  i feel like i should say something else. but i'm kinda out of words. i'm really excited, i'm going to brush my teeth and then go and read the argus in my bed with all the lights off but my flashlight with the window open so i can hear the wind blow. XTREME. peace out fools.  p.s. if you fake tan or are really muscular, the truth is i'm probably jealous? or maybe not. who knows really.

      Well today i got a "review" at coffeerush--basically it's where they decide whether to keep you on the staff or not. i'm a little shaky about things, now acutally i think that i'm paranoid about things now. peg basically said that she likes me, but if i dont hustle my butt up on bar and what not, then she'll have to let me go. scary. i dont want to go back to wendy's! PLEASE DONT MAKE ME GO! so basically i'm just going to have to work a little bit harder and try and pick things up a little bit faster. interesting.  do you think that you have control over your emotions? it proposes an interesting question for myself. today i tried to hold in whatever else i was feeling and convey complete and utter happiness. before i knew it, that feeling took over and i couldnt even really register anything but being really happy. it was quite bizarre. but you know, i'm not sure that this is completely possible. i dont think that we have control of our emotions all the time. maybe because for reactions that our own body has, chemicals and what not, i dont think that we can control it all the time. i think for the most part we can, but as a whole i'm not quite sure we do.  i'm trying to compile my top 10 favorite songs of all time. it's quite difficult. so far i have: Magicstick by 50 Cent--wait wait, let me explain. there's a LOT of memories and good times attached to that song. i'm not straight up thuggin...yet. HOLLA  Desperado by the eagles--pretty self explanatory.  then i'm at a loss for the next 8, because well there are way too many great songs. any ideas?   i think that now i am going to go workout at the gym with mr ian jake daggett. have a wonderrrrful night.

      today i am finally content once more. i took myself on a little off the road tour of life. i had my fun. i hit some bumps. i even lost sight of the road for awhile. but instead of me finding the road, the road has found me, and welcomed me once more. tonight was a good night.   i got to see miriam today. it made my life so..awesome. i love being around her. it makes me so happy. it fills me. i just i cant..TOK was right, language isnt enough. it isnt enough to explain how i feel..just to see her, to hear her voice, to touch her hand, and to hug her. and to feel her fit right next to me. she is so beautiful. i love her smile. i love her.  i think it is so weird how life works out. i read chris's blog today. and he talked about leadership camp and how we hung out (we are thuggin brutha's pherrell afterall). but if you had asked me a year ago if i thought i would be good friends, maybe even friends with chris, i would have said...well probably not. but i am friends with him now. it's cool how life works out.  you know this post (in the first paragraph) and my post about marshmallows both are symbolic of something else. and i think the only person who might get what i'm saying is megan.  &nbsp; Dear Megan, Do you know what i mean by the symbolism in my posts? if you did that would be ....really neat!  do you know what this summer needs more of. BBQ's. yes it does. i would offer to have one at my house, but we are landscaping/redoing (what is the word?) our backyard. however i would willingly supply and cook and whatever for a BBQ if someone would so kindly lend their backyard. we can have corn on the cob! and have a big waterfight (another summer thing). and then stay up all night. and laugh a lot. and watch se7ven. because jennifer lenny and elizabeth havent seen it. BBQ! BBQ!  &nbsp; i am now going to go listen/read "one flew over the cuckoo's nest" for IB. i am pulsating invigeratingly with excitement.  Dear ______, i hope you know that the way you are is awesome. you light up the room. people are drawn to you. everybody laugh's when you're around. everybody smiles when you're around. you have a&nbsp;way of making somebody feel like they matter. your intensity is unique, and though you may see it as a flaw, it really makes you&nbsp;even more special. dont be afraid to speak your mind, your opinion&nbsp;is valid, and it is who you are. learn to be comfortable&nbsp;with&nbsp;who you are. love yourself.&nbsp;you are an awesome person and i cant get enough of you.&nbsp;oh how would ms denny would hate me: never change, stay sweet!  &nbsp; -neil  &nbsp;

      i just got home from leadership camp today. it was really a good time, way much more so than i thought it would be. i felt really grown up..being the seniors of the camp. it was so bizarre to realize that i am the senior, i'm at the top (of high school..what a letdown! haha). i have to say that i love getting to know new people, it's so exciting to me. although...  &nbsp; i have to say i wish this world was completely free of judgement. i know that it's not possible. but i just, i really hate judgement. i hate the labels that i put on other people. i try so hard not to judge, and yet i find myself doing it either in my mind or even outloud sometimes. and i HATE it. and i hate the labels that are put on me. i hate wondering if people like me. or what they think of me. because labeling is frickin' stupid. when it comes down to it, get rid of everything...we're all the same. this is such&nbsp;a simple concept. the world makes everything so complicated. maybe not even the world. but just..we. i mean ourselves. or something  i am so tired. i am always tired when i post. it is fun. i dont know. whee4e  &nbsp; good night.

      today i was at work. lindsay, a co-worker at coffeerush, and i were sitting there going about making coffee and such when i mentioned that our best friend (well..imaginary as of now) was in town. who is our best friend you may wonder? Jessica Simpson of course. lindsay asked why we werent going to see her. i laughed. lindsay asked.."No seriously..why arent we going to see her". It was then decided we would go, come hell or high water (is that the saying?) to see jessica simpson in concert that night. and we did. it was so random, but one of the best days of my life, not just this summer, but my life. i had so much fun, i laughed so hard, and jessica simpson, yes she is pretty awesome. she is a great performer. she radiates a warm, genuinely awesome feeling and you feel it in you. women, children, men, grandparents, all alike were all together just havin' a good time with jessica simpson. oh a bonus for me and lindsay. when we got there we were like, oh our tickets are all right..probably be able to see her...with big huge binoculars. turned out we were about 6 or 7 rows from the stage. we were about 10 feet away from jessica simpson.   &nbsp; but it's cool, cuz she is our best friend after all. she tried to hangout with us afterwards, but her agent said she had to do some sort of meet the press type thing. it's all good.   &nbsp; i'm going to leadership camp for the next few days. i think it'll be a lotta fun, i'm really looking forward to it.  &nbsp; i'm sorry i think this blog post probably let some of you down. but again..tonights post is a self-post. because i had the time of my life at jessica simpson's concert and i would do it all over again in a heartbeat. i am comfortable "in this skin". yes jessica, yes.

      ugh. i can feel this guilt, this evil, this "demon" of my life if you will, i can taste it and feel it burned into my mind, it's like a huge frickin marshmallow on a stick thats burning and it's a huge flame, and it's charring the marshmallow and it's charring my life and i feel like the way i'm trying to put it out is by fanning it back and forth, you know what i mean? but it doesnt work, instead it just feeds the fire. i know the way to put it out. it's simple. just trust, put my faith in the thing i know i must. leave it to that, and a simple fresh breath of true freedom will extinguish that flame, that i cannot put out myself. but i first  must  give myself to the breath. i must take that leap of faith. put my heart where i know i must. and not a half-baked job of it. a full on, giving myself to it. putting my trust there, giving myself there. not even keeping one bit of it for myself. it's a big jump...but i think i'm getting closer to the edge, and am ready to jump. breathe your sweet life into me please.   &nbsp; does that make any sense to anyone at all?

      She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger And finally drank away his memory Life is short but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees We found her with her face down in the pillow Clinging to his picture for dear life We laid her next to him beneath the willow While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby  ~~  You see my old man's got a problem He live with the bottle that's the way it is He says his body's too old for working I say his body's too young to look like his My mama went off and left him She wanted more from life than he could give I said somebody's got to take care of him So I quit school and that's what I did  ~~  Don' you draw the queen of diamonds, boy  She'll beat you if she's able  You know the queen of heats is always your best bet   Now it seems to me, some fine things  Have been laid upon your table  But you only want the ones that you can't get   Desperado.  &nbsp;

      so random thought of the day.  &nbsp; constantly i'm surrounded by people. i try to be groundend in my own sense of independence, but really, what the hell is independence anymore? is it even worth it? and honestly (and by independence meaning 'uniqueness'), does there exist such a thing as independence anymore, or is that red robin little coaster thing right, "you are unique...just like everybody else." is acting a certain way just to be unique really unique? or is listening to britney spears because you like britney spears being unique? okay honestly now, define unique.  &nbsp; &nbsp; in the words of a.a. mills...get out of my chair DILLHOLE. &nbsp; &nbsp; oh ______ and your wild ways.  &nbsp; &nbsp; pherell fool. pherell.  &nbsp; you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor.

      i just got finished watching 2 of my favorite movies of all times. and instead of me just talking, i decided to post a few quotes from those movies because they are currently what is all over my mind right now. the movies prevoked thoughts and reawakened my senses. if you havent already, you should view "edward scissorhands" and "the breakfast club".  PS i didnt edit the cussing.  Peg: How was it?  Edward: It was great. She showed me all the wallpaper and where everything is going to go.  Peg: Well that's nice.  Edward: And then she brought me in the back room where she took all her clothes off.  -ES John Bender: YOU ARE A BITCH.  Claire Standish: Why? 'Cause I'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch?  John Bender: NO. 'Cause you know how shitty that is to do someone, if you don't got the balls to stand up to who you like.  -TBC Kim: Before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards, it did. I don't think it would be snowing now if he weren't still up there. Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.  -ES Andrew: What do you need a fake I.D. for?  Brian: So I can vote.  -TBC Edward: Because you asked me to. -ES Brian Johnson: Dear Mr. Vernon: We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it is we did wrong, but we think you're crazy for making us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us: in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.  -TBC   great, great movies.

      i had a teacher in middle school named mrs robinson. i think i did at least. she taught me social studies. i didnt like that class all that much. but she was cool. and her shoes were hip.  this is like my millionth post in 4 days and i've gotten 0 comments on all of them. at first that stressed me out, but then i realized all the benefits i've reaped for myself just from having this that are so much greater than having the satisfaction of having comments. although, dont feel like you cant comment, it just makes me feel better. kind of like, the cream in the middle of an oreo cookie. or a dolphin.  tonight i got a star trek communicator device (i'm not quite sure what the politically correct term is for it) from hillary, i am really exhilerated about it. it lights up red and beeps. i nearly wet myself with the excitement.  geeze. what is the purpose of language really? who knows. if i could have an interpretive dance blog, i would do that. maybe someday i will. that would be neat.   anyways i'm really tired and really craving sleep like a dog craves a fire hydrant to release his urniary ways.    g'night.  -neil

      so the sports world is gearing up for one of the biggest events that competes the world's best athletes all to claim glory and be champion of the competing countries in quite possibly the world's biggest competition: the olympics. the us time trials for both track and field and swimming are occuring at this point and time. i watched both of them and was really entertained, but then again i love watching track and swimming. there is something about those athletes..it is purely captivating to me. but as i was watching i had an unfulfilled desire: i want to be a competetive athlete. and i dont mean just a high school athlete. i crave, i desire, i want so badly to be the best. i know that this is a dream. but then i started asking myself, why? why is it just a dream? the majority of these athletes are in their mid to late 20's..i'm 17, i have a ton of time to start working towards it now. so what is stopping me? the answer is nothing. just something i've been thinking about today haha. sorry to those of you that are completely uninterested in the world of sports.    i had the privelage today of catching up with two friends who have been at college. it left me wanting more time with them as well as the feeling of immense excitement for when i get to leave for college. it's weird, i dont think there's been a time that so many emotions have flooded my brain when i thought about something than when i think about college. man it is so good to see some people, do you ever feel like when some people leave it leaves you feeling incomplete? that was exactly how i felt. but it's weird, people come and go all the time. it's like..that piece of me tonight was filled after not being filled for so long. it was awesome.  kara and andrea come home on monday. i cant wait. i am so excited. a whole new chapter of my summer begins monday night at 10:30 PM (assuming their flight is on time).    i am tired.    i love you all. :)   g'night.  -neil

      Dear ________, I am really ...well i dont know what the word is for it with you right now. you know, it just bothers me how i sit around and i wait for you and then you never follow through with anything. today isnt the first day this has happend. yea we do hangout ocassionaly and we have fun, but those times are like..once in a blue moon. i dont get you at all. you say that we are good friends, but whenever i want to do soemthing, or try and make plans with you are always too busy, or too tired, or this is happening or that is happening. you know what hurts my feelings worse? how i know that you love going places with your "other" friends. the "other"=a label that i wont actually put on here because then you may know that this would be directed at you and i dont want that to happen. i'm just trying to get out some emotions right now. i just wish and hope that some day, i'll mean as much to you as you mean to me.  -neil.

      tonight i watched a surprisingly good movie: Grind. it is about a group of 4 guys who just spend their summer tyring to get sponsored for skating. i wouldn't put it in my all time favorites list, but it was a pleasant surprise i must say.   what is your favorite movie? i think that a person's favorite movie really does say a lot about them. i have a few favorites that come to mind. it's funny, because most people (i think these people are a little more intelligent than i am) choose movies that are real thinkers, beautiful cinematography, precise acting, everything in the movie is perfect. my movies that i love..i like them just because they maek me feel good and happy.   i am tired and my head hurts, but not too badly. it is good that it doesnt hurt too badly as opposed to badly. yes that is true.  tomorow is full of options. sauvie's island=tempting. ballacrosse=tempting. buffalo exchange=tempting. friends marathon=tempting. oh the insanity, when will it ever end?   g'night

      my quads hurt and feel strained. it's a good feeling.  tonight was a bunch of carefree fun, something i've been needing for a long time. i dont usually just go through and say what i did, but tonight is a different night of sorts. as soon as i got off work i came home and it felt good to sit down. you know that feeling right after you've been standing for a long time and you finally get to sit and you can feel it in your feet and it feels really good? well tonight was like that when i got home. and so i sat. then what should happen? the phone should ring of course. my good friend rose potter would be tonight's caller. we made plans. we picked up cassie seawell who i havent seen in awhile. off to shari's in tanasbourne we went! i was dissappointed to findout that the food at shari's in tanasbourne is no better than the food at shari's here. big time bummer for me. the 3 of us talked. we laughed. we talked some more. it was really fun. then we went to albertsons. i almost hit a car and left cassie behind. but we went back for her. she needed a friend. rose and i decided to prank call people. 1st winner: jenni peden. we called. she called back. she was at marks house. MARK! i missed mark. we decided we should go over there, smuggle TP and then TP her car. off to marks we went! not only was jenni and mark there. but also katie fast, joey, brad, and i think tyler may have been there. it was exciting. by this time i really had to pee. so i excused myself. i began searching the bathroom for toilet paper, but to my dismay, the toilet paper was absent! so i took the remaining toilet paper along with 2 feminine hygeine products. we informed them that cassie had to be home at midnight and so we "left". oh ho ho ho we didnt really leave. we came back. and ....we tp'd. michief makers 2004 struck once more. after that, the fun finally ended and i took cassie and rose home, but the good times continue rolling.   now the reason i am writing about all this, the events of my evening is really kind of a simple thing, and may be really unimportant to you. but tonight i realized how badly we need to have uninhibited fun. just do whatever you want say whatever you want and surround yourself with people who totally dig that. tonight i didnt think about anything bad, anything negative, i just had an honest feel good time. i hope that the summer has more of these nights in store me.   dear cassie and rose- thank you so much for such a fun evening, i really think the 3 of us should hang out more. pizzacatto? hmm..  dear mark- even though i know you wont read this, we should hang out more like back in the old days. you're a good guy, i love ya bro.   g'night  neil  PS i think i'm going to post some pictures now. wheeeeEE

      things that totally suck: difficult times in life trying to put the past behind you gas prices angry people certain people in general.  thinking about college thinking about the upcoming school year people who dont return phonecalls unanswered questions certain songs by certain bands/singers ashlee simpson having a record contract, michelle burnett not having one. kara and andrea being gone certain people who think that i dont want to be their friend--i dont really get that one so much seeing roadkill driving down 32nd thinking about food while i'm eating it change..  things that totally rock my world hardcore style: FRIENDS! (yes the tv show and my actual friends) gas prices going down the drive in movies the girl of my dreams driving around for long periods of time doing absolutely nothing and yet having the time of my life boating with kaitlyn moore remembering kara and andrea come home on MONDAY!! berries from the farmer's market farmer's market in general making new friends being weird and crazy, but learning to love it all the same. finding out who you are being happy in the midst of the downs of life being totally confused with where life is taking you..and why life sucks so much..but deciding to take that on with a smile instead of anger my job and my co-workers brushing my teeth laughing smiling thinking about colleges and what the future has to offer knowing that, people who suck i can either a)avoid, or b) they'll be leaving soon enough (only a year left to deal with some of em'!) realizing that even if people "suck" they still have so much importance in my life..and teach me so much about myself and how the world works. stars sunsets sammy my dog and sammy kara's dog MUSIC summer   hmm. good stuff. i think that even though it's hard, when you have a really tough time in life..no matter what i think the good stuff in life always will outweigh the bad. keep your chin up kid. you can get through this dawg.   g'night.

Dear Ryan- do you know what is funny? i spelled Hillary's name the way hilary duff spells hers. thus the absence of one of the "L"'s   Dear Hillary- okay, lets pick out a day where we both are free, because i want to hangout with you really soon. also when do you leave for college?

      today i was driving down the road. and i was following this man in a red truck. and he was driving very slow. and at first i was very very angry and tailgating him. and then i glanced briefly at his sideview mirror. his face held so much joy, and so much serenity. i dont know what it was, but there was something about him that made the whole world seem much more peaceful than i had made it to be for those few minutes of anger. then as if i was in some sort of bizarre movie (and probably with Louis Armstrong's "Wonderful World" playing in the background) i saw thing that added into my wonderful drive. a woman pushing a stroller and the baby pointing at a tree, a couple and their dog going for a jog (that rhymed!), a woman of indian descent waiting patiently at the bus stop, and happy familys in the cars destination--wherever! and i felt truly alive and awakened to how beautiful this world can be sometimes.   Dear Hilary- I would call you, but I dont think i have your number. I want to hangout with you though, because it will be oh so much fun. perhaps i will get your number from vanessa. or perhaps you should give me your phone number on here or at my email adress. sportsspart6@muchomail.com  -Neil  i am really excited. the drive in. plus neil. plus miriam. = good good times. oh and of course..HP3 is always a bonus.    let the good times ....ROLL.  thats a ten-four soldier. over and out.

      In all honesty, do you believe in miracles? Now think long and hard before you answer that. Do you believe in miracles? It is quite the quandary, because the first inclination I'm sure is yes. But then when you think about science or other significant explinations you may begin to doubt your answer. I don't believe there is a right or wrong answer to this question, but my answer is yes, I do believe in miracles.   Dear Beach, I wish i was staying at you tonight instead of here with my big gulp neighbors. the ocean sounds a lot more appealing than big loud firework explosions.  is anybody else highly afraid of fireworks or am i just a loser?   today was fun. sat around and enjoyed an awesome summer day, like you enjoy a candy cane durring christmas time. went to soccer. got my butt kicked. time to get in shape neil. yessir.   oh to be an ostrich, what a wonder that might be.  g'night.

      random question of the day:  Tonya Harding, ice skating goddess, who brought all the spotlight to ice skating, OR a disgrace to portland, and oregonians in general? (think long and hard about this one..who even knew what figure skating was about until the harding-kerrigan scandal?)   sometimes i feel like my life is reality tv! tomorow it will be! maybe i might post some pictures. but then again maybe not, i guess you'll have to wait and see what the reality is! HAHAHA i am so funny sometimes.  i'm going to go eat captain crunch and watch full house. it's like i'm 7 again!

      a thought from last night:  miriam was playing the piano last night when i was over. she played cannon in d. she didnt want to, but i of course, forced her to. and as she began to play, i was hoping that i could stay in the moment forever. she was so beautiful as she played. i just wanted everything to fade away and just be with her and watch her play. i feel like i fell in love all over again. i am so lucky..   a thought from today:  first, i must say i really really enjoy pressure washing. it really is just fun. i dont know why i enjoy it so much, and i probably shouldnt but it makes me think of maybe what it's like to live in a waterfall.  second, while i was pressure washing, i started thinking. and i came to a realization. i think that too often people try and live to please others. i know this sounds simple, but it's so true. our lives are dominated by wanting to please others. and that may be a good thing, trying to put others first, but is it such a good thing? in actuality, we are the only ones that have to deal with our actions. and that could mean a few things. to some it may just be themselves they have to confront. to others it could be their conscience. and to some it could be a higher power.  i am guilty as charged with trying to please others too often. majority of the time i find my life, my emotions, my goals even, dictated by what others will think, what others want, what others say. and as i was pressure washing, i wondered WHY? my new goal is to yes, think of others, but now to do some things for myself. because i think that is a healthy thing to think about.  that is my thoughts for the day(s).  i stink from working outside. shower i must.  much love is sent to all.  hoping happiness is with you, -neil

      tonight was a fun night. and it involved a LOT of my favorite people of all time (but not all, because well..you werent there. unless you were there. interesting concept...).  i got to spend time with miriam today which was really nice. and then she and i went to the service at harvest. it was hard for me to go to harvest today because it is the first time i've been to church since about may when..well things in my life kind of went off-course if you know what i mean. it was awesome to go back though..it just felt so right, and it just felt like God was just welcoming back and giving me a huge hug, it was an awesome feeling. i then got to spend time Oregon's 2005 Junior Miss, KARA GIROD (congratulations, holler, and thanks for the cd by our "mystery friend"....) and josh and andrea parson. red robin does have wild ways..   and then it was like a reunion of the old days. jennifer and i went stalking, just like we used to. i wont tell you who we went to stalk (it might be you...) but i will say it was massive amounts of fun.   today leaves me feeling really content with life. kind of like one of those times when you're smiling, and you dont know why, but you just cant stop smiling. it's an awesome feeling to have. and knowing that i'm just standing on the edge of everything. whew. it's gonna be intense (that's a direct shout-out to moose...do you know what thats from?)  got soccer practice tmw. hopefully i dont die. or throw up either. though both remain possibilites. stupid neil and your out of shape ways.  Dear _____, I am so sorry for what is going on in your life right now. Man, i wish there was something i could do that could give you rest and make you happy. I want so badly for you to find what you want, whatever it is. Give yourself a break..and remember you've done the best you can.  Always here if you need it, -neil   i have to be up in 4 hours for work, life rocks! HAHAHA! night.

      First, and i believe most important, i am watching "full house". goll those tanner's are CRAZY and somewhat out of control.  so tonight i came to a few ...realizations? conclusions? i dont really know what to call them..just a few things i noticded.  - as you get older, things get easier to handle. today something happend, and while in the past it would have really made me upset and feel bad about myself and i probably would have dwelled on it. but today instead of feeling bad for myself, i thought to myself the circumstances in which the comment was coming from. and i tried to pick out why they would say what they were saying as well as a reason i could still be thankful for that person. and i succeeded, and i felt much better.   and while i think that i'd say...well i dont have a percentage but a good portion of the world moves in that direction, i'd say another portion stays to the equivelant of middle/high school maturity level. those people make me sad, and sometimes chip away at my hope, but take a deep breath and then things begin to look up. right? right.  well there are other things i want to write about, but i'm tired (...it's 10:09, wow i'm pretty sad), i want a bowl of cereal, and full house awaits me.   g'night.  -neil

        tonight i went to the gym. the shirt i was wearing was given to me by kara. as i worked out, i was omitting the smell of kara's laundary detergant. it was really weird. i felt like i was bathing in someone else's scent. on a weird scale..i kinda liked it. it was nice to have a new smell. wow sometimes i amaze myself with my...i dont want to say weirdness but i'm too tired to think of another word.          i went through all of my college stuff today..and though i feel like i spent hours and hours looking at it, and i read a ton of it and even filled out (partly) an application, i still feel like i basically got nothing done. it's really irritating.                Dear Miriam,     I miss you.          So i've had this blog thing for awhile now. and i knew how to put pictures up awhile ago. but now i have no clue again. i also amaze myself with my own stupidity. i dont even know how to put a little picture thing up for my profile. maybe i shouldnt even be going to college!           i am so determined.               goodnight.          PS i tried a new font. i am cutting edge.

      i got my haircut today. i always think it's a cool feeling to feel your hair being cut. and seeing all your hair float to the ground. it's sort of reaffirming in a way..not sure of what, but reaffirming none-the-less.  so this "moment of truth" i spoke of came. and it's climatic peak, i found to be more of an awakening than anything else. my moment of truth? nope. but i definitely began to realize a lot of things in that moment. i totally feel at a crossroads. do i take the road less traveled? oh robert frost and your wild ways...  the weather has been perfect. although, alaska would be better. i hear this time of year it's sunny at 60 degrees. thats my kind of weather. i'm not one for the heat. bring on the good ole' oregon rain.  i am out of things to say tonight. i know which road i choose to sojourn..it is the road less traveled. i close my eyes, and i take the big jump.         let the good times roll.
