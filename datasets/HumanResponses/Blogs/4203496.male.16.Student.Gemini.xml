      Yeah, I was in Toronto this week staying at a friends house, it was alright. Lots of AOE2 and Beyond Good and Evil, videogames and the Olympics were what passed the time, man how I hate the olympics. It always takes the time spots of my favorite sitcoms! Anyways, I want to encourage people *who am I kidding?* to check Beyond Good and Evil! Over shadowed by other large games being released this game went way under the radar. Utilize a camera to uncover goverment secrets (we won't find any abused POW's don't worry, well actually you will) roam across Hillys ( a futuristic planet) in your hovercraft and yes, interstellar ship *unleashes killer metal riff*  Great soundtrack/voiceover work gameplay is insanely great and the graphics are nicely polished. Unfourtunatly it does suffer from some poor camera angles that take away from the gameplay, not to worry slight problem the goods out do the bad 1000 to 1

      Went out the other night, decided it was time I saw the light of day. I know, *gasp* but the sun didn't burn. We went off to Taco Bell (wouldn't want to clean the bathrooms there) evidently no one does, they are as filthy as, as, a resteraunt selling spicy food's should be. That wasn't even the highest point of the evening though!   The Village , It was good, my father hated it but my mom and I stand by our decision. It was one heck of a film, eerie and odd but good. Now see it, I comand you.  *ends tansmission*

      Listen, we have a problem, a HUGE problem, this problem is fairly new and could scar the industry of videogaming.  The Kingpins of some of the large producers of videogames watch numbers, they like numbers, if they see a game with high numbers, they see what they did that was so grand and they duplicate it, in a slightly different manor. This is where the problem comes in.  Grand Theft Auto 3, innocent enough, no? Well, it isn't so nice when every single promising game coming out on the market is a rag-tag spin off of the go any where do anything, steal cars. shoot people genre. "What's so bad about this?" you may ask, well, first of all, I'm not even a fan of the series, sure at first I admired there ingenuity and there break through gameplay, but now, it's a kick in the face. Take Jak and Daxter for example, that game was as far from GTA as Canada to the moon. With the unfortunate release of 'Jak 2' it has become just another of the lowly peas in GTA's pod. I say we give the fat cats a message and tell them to take their numbers and flush 'em. You killed Jak and Daxter and put a permanent scar on the Videogame industry!   + Jak and Daxter +  (That would be an e-shrine lamenting their passing.)
