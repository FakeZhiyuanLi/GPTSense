      Check out  urlLink AudioScrobbler .  Seems like a pretty cool tool. Will be happy when they add RealOne plug-in as I hate using almost all other media players.

      Its just gone midnight and "I've" just created a Blog site! So welcome to whoever finds this.   Its been an odd day; I had my third exam this week at 1800. Think it went ok. After the exam, walking back to my bike I found the front wheel missing (quick-release, knew it would happen eventually). Stupid thing was that it was chained right outside a security camera, so my first thought was to hunt it down in some nearby hedge or go find out who had access to the video. I eventually found it propped up against a wall being badly hidden by a group of young lands who I saw only moments earlier knocking bikes over! Needless to say, they didn't put up much of a fight when I simply walked over, picked it up and disappeared with it. Just glad i got it back, would hate to have to walk, or worse, catch stinky expensive busses!  The day is over but it seems I just don't know it yet. The tail-tail signs i should probably take note of are when i'm surfing the net looking at the prices of breadbins on Froogle! *boggle*  I'll grab a cold drink and blow some people up in Desert Combat for 30min before i hit the hay i think.  Night ;)

       urlLink Mortalis of Venril Sathir    This is one of my babies. Its a site I've been running now for about 2.5 years and its for a guild call Mortalis on Venril Sathir in EverQuest.  I'll tell you one day all about how EQ paradoxically changed my life for good and for bad. Until then, you can browse the news archive to see the l33t talk of loots obtained and battles won (in that order) and visit the public forums to see how not so l33t people chat to the guild members of Mortalis on an infrequent basis.  I shall summaries EQ for you for now before you draw any illusions of the game being remotely interesting.  It stinks; To be content in the world of EQ you need to spend more time playing the game than any clinically sane person would spend watching the TV, going out for walks, socializing at a normal level (non-virtual) or even going to work. This game needs a bigger warning sign on it than tobacco because it quite simply kills your real life.  That aside, if you're only looking for a bit of role-playing fun a couple of times a week then this game can also satisfy those desirse too. It caters for a whole range of player types, just that unfortunately it can lead to OD, as I shall explain another day.  I enjoyed putting the site together and hosting it. I enjoy producing a community environment and pleasing people with the sites aesthetic and functional characteristics. This month (June 04) i shall be revaming the style of the site and removing alot of the JavaScript and DHTML features which in totalaty caused the homepage to load slowly.  I am also publishing some new sites over the next couple of weeks and shall make those publicly known when they are fully up ;)
