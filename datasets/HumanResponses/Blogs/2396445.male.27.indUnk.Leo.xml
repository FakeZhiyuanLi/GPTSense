      California supermarket strike.  I don't want to sound too harsh but I'm totally sick of this stupid supermarket union strike.  I just went to the market and got hassled by some picketers.  I mean, Jesus, they should be happy that they have a job and have the ability to get heathcare.  I work, and I have to pay some extra money for my healthcare.  Nothing in this world is free.  I guess it's that stupid-ass American mentality.  People tend to forget that most things in life are privileges, not God-given rights.  So my advice to the union workers on strike: Stop complaining and get your lazy asses back to work...!  --- These are my own thoughts.

      My friend is a buzz kill.  I was driving with my friend to meet some people for Karaoke.  My friend didn't really want to go but he wouldn't say it.  Instead, he told me he would sleep in the car while I hung out with my other friends.  What a wuss.  I wasn't about to leave him in the car to sleep when what he really wanted was to go home.  Damn...  I think the people who end up having the least fun are the ones who can't adjust and deal with new situations.  Sometimes it good to force yourself to do something you don't really like with people you don't really know, if anything to just be a good friend when your buddy wants to hang out with his other friends...  --- These are my own thoughts.

      I saw a bumper sticker today: "I'm Proud To Be An American."  Then I thought to myself:  Should I be proud to be associated with a country that pretty much everybody hates?  We are arrogant, self-serving, and bunch of overweight bullies.  That's not really anything to be proud of...  --- These are my own thoughts.

If that happens then Taiwan will end up being a Chinese state or province anyways.  China is too slow to change from Communism?  Then they will attack Taiwan if they declare independence.  Either way, Taiwan is part of China, whether they like it or not...

      So I'm up at 1:23am again.  I told my buddies that I would go surfing tomorrow morning, but it doens't look like I'm gonna make it.  My plan was to go to sleep early but I guess I ended up watching TV and listening Sukiyaki by 4PM on infinite loop.  For some reason, listening to the song makes me feel better, ever though it should make me want to shoot myself.  At least it's not the ex's birthday anymore.  It still really irriates me that she doesn't try to contact me.  I guess that is my sign to move on.  The last thing I told her was that if she wanted to talk to me, she knew how and I wouldn't push anymore.  Argh... so that's what three years gets you these days?  Maybe she's waiting for me to call.  Or more likely, she's probably scared that I'm pissed, which I am.  There's a Catch-22.  Anyways, the longer she waits, the easier it gets for me.  So I guess I should be happy that she doesn't call me...  --- These are my own thoughts.  My interpretation of what I have written may differ from yours.

I've known her for a long time, she's been hangin out with me through two different breakups.  She reminds me to treat my friends better.  I tend to drop off the face of the earth when I get into a relationship.  I should stop doing that cuz girls come and go, but your friends, if they are true friends, don't.

      So today is my ex's birthday.  I haven't talked to her for almost a month now.  Not after I told her that if she wanted to continue talking to me, she would have to initiate the converations.  I think it's cold that I was within walking distance from her house in Taipei and she didn't try to contact me while I was in Taiwan.  It really sucks to figure out that our three years together has boiled down to this.  I could just cave in a call her, but then it would be just like when she left.  I've always put in the effort and sustained the relationship after she left for Taiwan.  Sometimes, I wonder if we are in some kind of waiting game, that maybe she's just waiting for me to call.  Everytime I start to think that, I catch myself and remember why we broke up to start with.  In the past, I've always called first.  I got tired and frustrated all the time.  I'm sure she's doing fine out there, and I'm not doing that bad.  So I'm just gonna say it here: Happy Birthday Maria.

      Went surfing three mornings in a row with my new board, which I have named Jade.  I'm so tired now.  I can't believe how much better I am now with this board.  I makes a big difference when you have the right equipment.  Today, I caught the best wave I've ever ridden.  I dropped in late and made a very steep drop right into the pocket.  Then I rode the wave for a bit, trimming along the break.  My buddy was coming out from the inside and he saw the whole thing.  Too bad he didn't have camera...

      So it's official, well practically.  I went to go get my passport photos and dropped a few things in the mail:  - Negative CIR to USC. - Postivie CIR to UCLA, along with a bunch of forms and two 2x2 passport photos for my BruinCard. - Deposit to UCLA ($1500!).  On an interesting note, the girl at Kinko's asked me if I was going anywhere interesting.  I best I could muster was," No, I'm going back to school and these are for my ID card."  What a lame answer.  I should have lied and said something interesting like," I'm going to Costa Rica to do some surfing."  Oh well, I've never been too smooth at stuff like that...

      Things seem to be going well for me today...      I managed to wake up early and go surfing.  I caught a bunch of good waves.  Actually, this is the first time I've had a lot of fun surfing in a while.  I must be getting back in shape.    When I got to work, I found that someone had unplugged the machine I was working on without shutting it down properly.  It wouldn't work right when I fired it up.  I was about ready to kill someone!  On top of that, we had this whole ordering issue with our company's stock of ethanol.      Amidst all the gloom, I called UCLA and they told me I got it (see post below)!  At that point, I was stoked.    Then around lunchtime, the girl I met that went to my high school called and told me she is coming down to San Diego.  I feel kinda bad that she is driving down from Torrance to hang out with me.  I think she wants to come down because I asked her if she wanted to go see Maroon 5 with me tomorrow at the Del Mar Fair.  She can't go to the concert but will come down tonight instead.  I will have to take her someplace nice to make up for all the trouble.      BTW, I just got that stupid machine back up and running.  I knew that if I futzed around with it enough I could get it working.  Turns out that the camera on the vision system doesn't take well to hard resets and lost its IP settings.    Wow, that was a long post.  Now I need to clear my head so I don't act like and idiot when I'm hanging out with the girl tonight...

      Went surfing after a hiatus of about 3 weeks.  My arms are about to fall off.  There were two dolphins playing in the water near us.  One of them decided to jump so close that I felt the water moving aroung my legs while I was sitting on my board.  It scared the shit out of me.

      Hmmm... work is changing.  There are rumors that we bought a Canadian company.  We are also cutting some people because we are trimming costs.  What sucks is that I know who is on the list.  What sucks even more is that he's a friend.  I've been trying to give him hints to shape up but it's fallen on deaf ears. Well, I don't know how he's going to take it.  He's been acting pretty strange lately.  I won't go into his problems but they center around his not being about to deal with his breakup with his girlfriend and gambling/debt problem he has.  The big day is Wednesday, my boss will break the news to him.  After the purchase of this new company is announced, I have no idea where GeneOhm is headed.  Will they still need me?

The parking lot was a challenge all in itself.  Then there was a trip to Ikea in Burbank this afternoon.  I can't believe how many people were there.  On top of that, it took us 1 full hour waiting at the stupid pickup area to get my mom's mattress pad.  If I had known, I wouldn't have volunteered to take my parents there.

      I called UCLA today, half expecting them to tell me outright that I've been rejected.  Actually, it was worse.  They told me that I have to wait 1 to 2 more weeks before they will get back to me.  What sucks is that now I have to ask USC for an extension of at least a week.  Unfortunately, I ended up talking to some guy that didn't seem to give a shit about me so my little speech about how much I wanted to go to UCLA fell on deaf ears.  I will try to call again tomorrow to see if I can get in touch with someone with a little more influence...  --- These are my own thoughts.

      Today's Lakers games was ridiculous!  We were jumping up and down all over the place when Kobe that last shot in regulation.  Then OT was just 5 minutes of rubbing the win in the Laker-hater's faces.  My neighbors must hate me now.  At least my predictions are still valid.  I was afraid of losing face in front of all my friends for a few moments.  I had opened my big mouth and told everyone how I thought this series was going to be controlled by marketing concerns.  I'm still on track...  --- These are my own thoughts. My interpretation of what I have written may differ from yours.

      Still thinking of my IM conversation with the ex yesterday.  One of my friends pointed out that I didn't even give her a chance to say anything.  My response was that if she wanted to say anything else, she would've done so regardless of whether or not I told her I didn't want to talk to her.  My point is, I don't expect anything out of her after not calling me when I was 200 yards from her house...  --- These are my own thoughts.

      Lakers vs. Pistons  Sad as it may seem, this is a scripted series and will play out for maximum benefit of both teams.  Even though I hate Karl Malone, we all know that no team can beast the Lakers right now.  So the best they can do is make it interesting.  Here is my prediction on how the series will play out and why.  Game 1 - Lakers lose to the Pistons.  This is a believable loss.  It's okay for the Lakers to lose the first game because the fans can say they got surprised by the Pistons.  Pistons fans will have a little more faith in their team and not give up right away.  End result: Lakers fans aren't too disappointed, and Pistons fans don't tune out the rest of the series because it seems like the Pistons have a fighting chance.  Game 2 - Lakers will win this one because it's the second to last home game they will play.    Game 3 - Lakers win.  They are on a role now it's 2-1 Lakers after this.  Game 4 - Lakers win.  Same as game 3.  3-1 Lakers but now they hype the pressure and how the team is built for this championship.  The press will set them up to crack under the pressure, and they will.  Game 5 - Pistons win.  This is good for the franchise as they put up a valiant effort and they don't lose the series in front of their home crowd.  the last thing the fans see is them winning and that will help the franchise next year in terms of ticket sales and promotions.  Lakers are still up 3-2 so this doesn't phase Lakers fans.  Plus, now they can win the series at home.  Game 6 - Lakers close out the series at home.  What a storybook ending!  They win at home in front of their fans.  Detroit isn't too bad off as they didn't lose in front of their fans and they put up a good fight, winning two games, against a team that everyone knows is better.  Even if I'm not exactly right, I'm calling this series 4-2 Lakers. There is no fucking way they would pass up a chance to win it at home.  There is just too much money involved and we all know that money is what makes our wonderful society what it is.  It's sad that I can sit here and predict this.  It will be even sadder if I'm right...   --- These are my own thoughts. My interpretation of what I have written may differ from yours.

      Before I go to sleep for the night, I leave you with some questions:  1) Is it okay to go out with your ex-girlfriend's cousin's ex-girlfriend? 2) Is it okay to date your friend of many years?  I pose these questions because they are relavent right now.  These are usually taboo issues: (1) because of the ex connection and (2) because it's always wierd to date friends.  You can easily destroy the friendship if it doesn't work out.    Anyways, I'm still pissed from the earlier IM episode.  I can't see any reason why I should be friends with the ex.  I don't need another pen pal.  I wanted to be her boyfriend.  In fact, I was ready to be more than just her boyfriend.  Alas, she doesn't see things the same way so we are not together anymore.  Argh... she didn't have to IM me and bring up all these lame feelings again.  I was getting along just fine trying to push those three years of memories and feelings into the back of my skull...   --- These are my own thoughts.

Well, I wouldn't exactly characterize beer and cheesecake as essentials but I guess they belong on the list becuase it's stuff I have a lot of now, even though my friends were supposed to consume them...  --- These are my own thoughts.

I am so pissed right now.  I know it's very childish, but I'm kinda pissed that she IM'ed me out of the blue because I've been trying to get her out of my mind for quite some time.  Also, she doesn't deserve to share in any of my accomplishments anymore.  She gave up that privilege when we parted ways...

      I have an interesting observation.  I broke up with the ex because we are at different stages in our lives.  She was not ready to settle down and I was.  The ironic thing is that now that I'm single again, I've been forced out of the "settling down" stage.  Now I'm at the same stage as she is in.  Relationships are all about timing I guess.  Now I have to find someone who is in the same stage as me, again...

      I got this as a forward today.  The fact that I find it funny shows how much of a geek I am.    Subject: Weapons of Math Instruction  At New York's Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule, and a calculator. At a morning press conference, Attorney general John Ashcroft said he believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction. "Al-gebra is a fearsome cult," Ashcroft said. "They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in a search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns,' but we have determined they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'There are 3 sides to every triangle.'" When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, "If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes."

Anyways, we had a hike back to my friend's place.  An interesting question came up:  Is it better to take care of a drunk guy or a drunk girl?  I think a drunk guy is easier to take care of because you can just park him in front of the toilet.  A drunk girl will probably make a fuss and be all bitchy cuz she's not feeling well.  I know when I get wasted, I just want to be left alone in front of the toilet...

      So what do you say when you see a friend in a movie theater  after  you've seen the movie.  It happened today to me while I was leaving Harry Potter, which is actually a very good movie.  I saw my friend and her friend going in to see the next show while I was leaving.  It was a bit awkward because I think she felt a bit guilty for not inviting me to see it with her and her friends.  But then again, I could just be reading into it too much.  Both of them were carrying a lot of food and their movie was about to start.  Maybe they were just in a hurry...

The issue was that he just wanted the phones and I was looking to get out of my current plan, which I was sharing the ex's brother.  So now I buy my airtime from him and send him a check for $30 every month.  Well, in Taiwan, I just used my phone on roaming cuz I was too lazy to buy a local SIM card.  It turns out I used about 100 minutes at $1.50 per minute for roaming.  I'm gonna cut him a check tomorrow.  I knew it was going to be expensive but I didn't know it would be  that  expensive...

It's another karaoke favorite that seems to come up everytime I go with my brother Vince.  This is mostly my fault cuz listening to  Eternal Flame  by Atomic Kitten, reminded me of this song.  Realizing that I had the CD in a box somewhere, I dug it out and ripped it.  I listened to it on my PDA along with the other songs and now it's thoroughly stuck in my head.  It's a good song except for the fact that whoever wrote it made up the word "tragical."  That's awesome, I want to be able to make up words too...

      Music is very important for me.  There's always a song to sum up what I'm feeling.  right now, I can relate to a few songs:   Flake, Jack Johnson : The lyrics of the chorus pretty much sums up my relationship with the ex.  She told me she might come back, I waited, and then I figured out that she wasn't coming back.   Someday, Sugar Ray : This is an old song that I listened to after I broke up with my frist ex.  It still applies now.   Numb, Linkin Park : I would think this is more about how the ex felt as I was trying to convince her to come back.   So Yesterday, Hillary Duff : She can't really sing but some songwriter really felt what I'm going through.   Sukiyaki, 4PM : It's and old song with an old message, but it sums up what I feel pretty well.   Eternal Flame, Atomic Kitten (Bangles) : This one is stuck in my head cuz my cousins and I sang it at KTV in Taiwan.  Yes this is the trip right after I broke up with the ex.  It's a wonderful love song, but it just reminds me of the breakup for now.   Pictures of You, The Cure : What do you think I was doing the whole time while I was waiting to see if the ex was going to change her mind?

The next two targets for me:   urlLink HP iPAQ Pocket PC h4350  - Even though I have a Viewsonic V36 (see a few posts below), I realize now that I need a simple laptop replacement.  What I really want to do is hook up to the local WiFi network and use MSN, write emails, and update my blog.  Having just spent the better part of a month converting from Palm to MS Pocket PC, the Sony Clie PEG-UX50 was out of the question.  I really wish they made something in that form factor that runs MS Pocket PC.  My buddy at work has the HP and it's nice.  Another irritating thing is that the WiFi for my V36 is on a SDIO card.  So I can't use the memory card and the WiFi at the same time.  The h4350 has built-in WiFi and a little keyboard so I don't have to peck at the screen with the stylus.  Now I just have to get rid of the V36 and all the extra crap I bought for it.   urlLink Dell W3000 30" LCD TV  - I recently lost the TV in the guest room becuase the ex decided to give it to her cousin.  So now I'm down one TV.  This thing would be great in my room, where I currently have a 27".  I plan to either get another digital converter box with DVR or move my computer in there.  Hmmm... Lindsay Lohan pictures on at 30" LCD monitor?  I don't think I'll ever leave my room again...

      I don't even remember what day I broke up with the ex anymore.  I think is was April 22.  The only thing I really remember is that it happened on a Thursday night.  Hmm... looking through some old e-mails I sent suggests it happened on April 8.  That would make sense cuz I went to a Padres game on the 11th and I was pretty miserable that weekend.  Has is been almost two months?  Time is moving faster than expected, which is good becuase it means I will get over this crap faster...

      God damn worked until past 1am today... But I got a lot of shit done at work.  I think it's cuz I've been slacking off for the last month so after this weekend I felt all recharged and ready to work.  It also helps that I'm back to doing stuff I like to do.  Don't worry, my boss reminded me that I still have to take care of all the other shit I was supposed to do after I get this more important stuff taken care of.  So another interesting thing that happened today was that the cousin of the ex called me and told me he couldn't deposit her tax refund check because the account was closed.  I didn't know anything and I sure a hell didn't want to help.  So I don't know.  I did feel bad for blowing him off so I called back later and told him that I was sorry for being mean to him.  It was funny being able to say "so..." when he told me what was going on.  I'm chuckling right now, in fact.  BTW, it is getting easier and easier not to think about the breakup and crap.  I think I'm through the angry, bitter stage now.  I wonder what stage is next.  Anyways, it's fucking 3:20am so I should get to sleep.  I'm gonna miss yet another day of morning surfing.  My friend are gonna stop asking me to go soon.  I think one of them has already given up on me.  I have to get my act together and get on some sort of regular schedule.  Damn, I just remembered I have to be at work earlier tomorrow to meet a vendor....  Aw shit... while I'm at it, I might as well mention that I went to someone's engagement party on Saturday night.  I didn't know anyone there since I was there with a friend of the friend, which makes me nothing.  Anyways, the fiance was freakin cute.  That got me all depressed to I just drank a lot of  vodka tonics, I think 5 or 6, and got thoroughly wasted, all the while checking out the fiance.  She was Japanese.  Did I mention she was super cute?  I hope she's happy getting married, good thing I didn't meet her earlier, I would've tried to make thing complicated...

      Interesting week.  I surfed on Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon.  I snuck out early to go surfing.  The waves sucked pretty bad this afternoon so I had a crappy time.  Anyways, I'm looking forward to surfing tomorrow morning up at pipes...

When I drive to go surfing at 5:30am, I usually see older, less expensive cars.  Do the people who have enough money to afford nicer cars have jobs that don't require them to be driving around at 5:30am?  I drive an Audi, if it wasn't for surfing, I would only be driving after 8am...

      This was quite an eventful week.  Here's some stuff that happened and a few thoughts:    So I get his random IM from the ex on Tuesday.  There was nothing of importance exchanged in the ten line conversation.  She asked me if I when I was going to UCLA.  Basically, this is all information she could've gotten by asking one of our many common friends.  So she used this questions to initiate a converstation that I thought was quite useless.  In the end, I felt pissed off.  She asked to have her own life and that's fine, she can have that.  Now she should stay the fuck out of mine...   I got my reading packet for Anderson's Leadership Foundation class.  There's like 20 case studies from Harvard Business Review.  I guess my school begins now...   So work is getting extremely irritating with the personality issues we have going on.  We have a power tripping girl who is making everyone miserable.  I want to just tell her off and put her in her place but she's not one to play by the rules.  Basically, she thinks she can play politics and undermine my boss and me, but she forgets that she's just an RA.  After three weeks of her shit, I really want her out of there.  The sad thing is that she doens't seem realize that all she has to do is listen to me and maybe she can improve and make everything better.  She likes to make everything personal.  The fact of the matter is, no one trusts or respects her anymore so no matter how hard she tries it doesn't matter...   Lance Armstrong kicks ass.  I've been watching Tour de France and he is simply amazing.  I just hope that one day I can be as dedicated to something as that man is...   I spent almost 6 hours in the water yesterday.  I was so tired that I slept almost 14 hours last night and I skipped out on this morning's session.  I will be going out in a few hours though.  When I went out on Wednesday, I had a miserable time.  This weekend's conditions are much more suitable for me, smaller and more consistent.  It's much more fun for me and allows me to concentrate on catching and riding waves, not trying to get out past the break.  Everytime, I go out, I can't get over how easy it is to just forget everything else and enjoy myself.  The only thing that comes close is long distance biking...   My friend is leaving soon for the east coast.  Although he was only around for the about 6 months, I feel that he has bonded with our surf crew quite a bit.  He is one of the most laid back people I have ever met and sometimes, he makes me feel like I worry about too much useless crap.  We'll miss him...

      So it's like 1:30am.  I've been playing with my new laptop and now I'm going to try to go surfing on 3 hours of sleep.  Anyways, I also found out what happens when you install two anti-virus programs together.  Argh.  Norton was already installed and I installed the one recommended by UCLA over it.  I thought I had disabled Norton but I guess not.  I was pissed because my new laptop was crashing on reboots.  Anyways, I somehow got it to boot up and I uninstalled Norton.  Everything seems to be fine now.  I'm wondering if I should just buy Office 2003.  I have Office 2000 and I'm not sure all the Anderson stuff will work with it.  Work is shitty right now too.  More about that later...

      Geez, I had written this nice long post about my FEMBA welcome event but it was lost because the wireless network at my parent's house sucks. Anyways, here is it again (sort of):   So I met about 60% of my FEMBA class this afternoon at this mid-summer welcome event. They gave us these pieces of paper to write people's information on but I ended up just folding it up and sticking it in my pocket. I mostly focused on trying to meet people and hopefully make some kind of impression. I realize now that I'm not really that good at these kinds of situations. I tend to be shy and not one to walk up to people and introduce myself. After spending the whole afternoon forcing myself to be social and outgoing I was drained. I hope that during the Leadership Foundation class in September, I get to know the people in my section better. I know that I will do better in a smaller group. It's just too hard for me to make an impression when there are 115 other people around me, all talking and trying to meet people. I guess I get too distracted and I can't concentrate on the person in front of me. I had hoped that I could be outgoing and confident at this event, in a way reinventing my personality, but now I know it's going to be more gradual of a change. At least I know it's something I should work on now...

It was a longboard break, the waves just rolled through and then dumped at the end.  Being on shortboards made it so we could only catch close-outs.  Sunday was a bit better up at Pipes, our usual weekend hangout.  2-3 foot waves and a few workable shoulders.  I was tired however, which made it hard for me to control my body and consequently, I ate shit on a few of the waves.  I haven't played tennis in a while so the Saturday afternoon session with some head honchos from my company made me all sore and lethargic on Sunday morning.  I kicked their asses, by the way.  I'm gonna sleep in the couch for the rest of the day...

      I've discovered over the course of the past few weeks that sometimes, it sucks to be the boss. There are times when there is just no way to please everyone; in which case, you just have to be strict and direct with everyone, whether or not they really deserve it. What sucks is that many of my employees I consider to be my friends as well. I was warned when I took this position that it's hard to be a supervisor when you are friends with your employees. The best I can do is tell them that it is strictly professional and hope the don't take things personally...

      This weekend was nice.  I surfed on my friend's Surf Perscriptions F-85 on Saturday morning at D Street.  I didn't do that well in the beginning but I caught a few nice waves towards the end.  Then I went to Surf Ride a bought a new surfboard (see below).  Saturday night, I went to Petco Park with some friends to watch the Padres play the Dodgers.  One of my friends had a room at the Omni Hotel next to Petco so we went to check out the room.  Swank.  I woke up at around 11:30am on Sunday morning because I drank so much the night before.  I waxed up my new surfboard and headed to the Carlsbad Factory Stores with a friend to look for some jeans.  God must be punishing me for being skinny, there were no 28" inseam jeans to be found.  I bought some shirts from DKNY and a pair of sunglasses from Kenneth Cole though.  Then I took Ivory out at Scripps Pier.  I had a lot of fun on the new board.  I caught a few nice waves right away.  I'm glad it wasn't too big of an adjustment moving to the shorter board.  After surfing, my two buddies and I had some milk tea and ate dinner at Islands.  Then I went home and did my laundry.  Now I am writing this stuff...

       urlLink    urlLink     Here's a few phone camera shots of my trunk after a visit to Surf Ride.  We discovered that stacking 4 boards like in the first picture will not allow the tailgate to close, so we had to cross them.  There is no way you can fit that many boards in a sedan.  Wagons are cool... urlLink

      Went to the Padres vs Dodgers game tonight.  The Dodgers lost, too bad.  I had 3 beers and a Stoli Tonic.  BTW, July 31, 2004 would've been 4 years.  Fuck it, I'm buzzed.  I'm going to sleep....
