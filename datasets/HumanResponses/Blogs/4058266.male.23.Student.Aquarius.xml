       I went to a Christian book store in Clairmont to buy a Bible. I picked one up and brought it to the register to pay for it and the lady behind the counter started to hit on me. She goes "We are having a blood drive and if you could donate some blood for us that would be great, we need some Young   and Healthy men." I was like "Young and Healthy huh?" She was like "Yes (with a smile) some Strong and Healthy men." I don't know if you would consider that getting hit on but I just find it funny because I was just trying to buy a Bible and she's all checking me out. What the hell.

       For the past 2 weeks my emotions have been tangled in a web of uncertainty.  I've been so busy with school and kung fu that I don't even know what's going on with me, as if I've been in limbo and there's no way out.  Hopeless?  No.  I don't think so.  The only feeling I can think of is "Numb".  Do I have emotions you ask?  I do.  I smile with happiness.  I cry with loss.  I... really don't know.  I should know myself pretty darn good by now and yet I still don't understand why I feel this way.        I'm not in a relationship anymore.  For the past 4 years I have dedicated my time and energy to my boo.  I have been single for the past week and don't know what to do.  We had so many things in common, so many places we would hang out, and just spending time with her family was great.  But, as the ups and downs continued we both agreed to take a break just so we could have time to think... and that's when I decided to be single.  I know she hurts, but now I have to think about myself first.  That's what I want.  I need time to grow by myself.  Time to be... Just me.         My motorcycle, my R6, My bike... was stolen from me last Friday the 23rd around 3pm.  I was having lunch with my homeboy at UTC and when we were on our way back that's when I noticed, my bike was gone.  It so happens that if we would have came out 10 mins earlier then we would have seen these guys.  My homeboys bike wasn't even touched.  3 long years that bike has been goal of mine.  I got it and with-in 5 months... Gone.  Blessing in disguise?  You could say that but I'm stubborn... I don't want to believe that.  Lord, help me forgive these bastards (sorry).  All I know is Karma is a BIT*H.       BUT, there has been good things that happened to me this week.    -  I've been able to read my books again.    -  I've had long conversations with the Lord.    -  I've had deep conversations with my sister (I miss that).    -  I've been reading the bible.       My feeling now you ask?  Numb.... Still.

        Kumu Lloyd once told me;  God did not make women from a man's foot bone so that man can walk all over her. God did not make women from a man's butt bone so that she would have to follow behind him. God made women from his rib so that the women can stand right next to man.  To be a man means to protect women.   That is your number one job.

       I had a great day at work today. All my kids that I teach are so adorable! Pain in the bu*t sometimes but still... I know they work hard when I'm with them. Its truly a great feeling you have when you teach someone as young as 5 to do a Kung Fu technique. They hit hard, yell loud and then have a wicked mean face all at the same time. Then you say, "Okay, relax." Their face lights up with a smile. =D I love it.  I'm also in charge of teaching brand new students (who never took martial arts) Kung Fu as well. I love it when they get all into the technique and their face lights up and you can tell that they are thinking, "This is so cool!" I love it.  As an instructor I'm also in charge of working out. Tonight we (all the other instructors) have seminar nights where we spar and play push hands. Tonight was a conditioning night. We have our annual instructor tournament coming up in two weeks so we have to be in shape for it. We did a couple bag workouts (kicking, punching, and kneeing the bags, oh ya about 2-3 minutes each). Then after all this is said and done we have to run 2 miles and beat our previous time. My time was 16:47 that I had to beat. My friend Leo was 16:27 (I think) but anyways, my Sifu told us that if we all beat our time tonight then we don't have to run this Saturday for the make up times that other people didn't beat. But, if one person doesn't beat their time then everything doubles... Basically, double or nothing. So we debated and then thought... If we are instructors, and we push our students all the time... Why the hell not! LET'S DO IT! So... We run like hell! I was thinking in my head the whole time "Just 20 seconds behind Leo!" "No worries!" I caught up to him and started to yell " C'mon Leo! I need you up here bro!" We finished our 2 miles in 15:47. Man... I walked back to help some of the other instructors push and we did it. None of us have to come in this Saturday.Its days like this when I feel the best about my fellow instructors. I know they have my back no matter what happens.  I know now that I have only 11 more days until the tournament. I have to remember, "While your not training, someone else is training to kick your butt!" Bring it.

       Yesterday, I went to Urban Outfitters with my sister and her boyfriend. I love this store although every time I go I never buy anything. (Yesterday I did buy something =D) Well, anyways... I was standing in front of the shirts and some guy walks up to me and asks me if I could grab him a "Trust me, I'm a doctor" shirt. I looked at him and said "Um... I don't know bro, you probably have a longer reach than I do." He looked at me with a confused face about to say something but then I said "Dude, I don't work here." He said "Oh you don't?" and then he got it himself. Man... This guy is a little bit taller than I am but still wanted someone else to grab his shirt. I swear some people are just soooo lazy!

       To my ex-boo,    I still love you. I will always love you. I will always think about you. I believe that this break-up is for the best for us, just so we can finish our goals in life, but also for many other reasons. I know you feel rejected in this time of need but do understand... That is not my intention. I truly believe that this is what I need right now. All the things that I used to do like, calling you just to say I love you, the times I would to hold your hand, resting my head on your shoulder when I'm tired, cutting my hair and waiting to see if you to notice. All of these little things I felt you took advantage of, but you know what... It's okay now. I have accepted it but still feel numb about the whole thing. I know that there is more to think about, but this is the only thing on my mind. At least our break-up wasn't on bad terms... I tell you boo, I still love you, I will always love you and I will always think about you.

       Ate,    Your the best person in the world. I appreciate and thank the Lord that you are in my life. It took us along time to get where we are now but man... It was worth it. When I'm down in the dumps you are the first person to notice. The first person to listen to what I need to say. The first person to help me realize if I was wrong or right. I just wanted to thank you on paper because you hear it always from my mouth, this time its different. I'm going through a lot right now and I couldn't do it with out your support. Thank you again.    Your loving brother,
