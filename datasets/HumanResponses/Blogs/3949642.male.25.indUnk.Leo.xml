      This is dedicated to my uncle, who died on duty at the age of 29, doing police work... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “Those that I fight I do not hate,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Those that I guard I do not love;”  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death, W.B. Yeats)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It was all white in the room,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The corpse in his winding sheet,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt in a new white sari,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staring into the silence where he had gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window, But I didn’t cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; She had gone crazy, my mom whispered,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between her sobs, “She is just 25, the poor girl”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just continued to look down,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the mosaic floor, not registering a word.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear the white saris softly flapping, But I couldn’t cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; My cousin sister came to me,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was five, did she understand?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took her out to buy her chocolate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear the neighbors’ shushing as we went by, But I still didn’t cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; On my way back in the train,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three passengers were discussing the police,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “All corrupt sons of bitches – they deserve to die”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remembered you, uncle, so proud of your uniform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could still hear my aunt screaming as nani lit your pyre, That’s when I cried. &nbsp;  --V.
