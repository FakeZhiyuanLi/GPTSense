      Well, I have a large music collection now (compared to what I had before, anyway). I got all of the cd's down, so now I'm just enjoying them and doing my thing. I've really not got anything to do, and I'm supposed to be in bed, but whatever. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon....  I should plan an outfit for tomorrow or something... I don't think I've ever done that before... except for weddings and stuff. Anyway, it's time for me to lie about going to bed. I'm going to bed now.

      Well, here I am, at my sister's house. Nothing going on really, hence my appearance on the computer. We went out and ran errands yesterday, and last night I acquired a bag of cd's to go copy onto my computer, but other than that we've just been sitting around the house. I saw this interesting show called 'Faking It' on TLC, where they take some random person (in this case a sheep-sheering kid from Colorado) and give them a couple weeks to learn a different profession (ie Hairstyling), and at the end, stick him in with a couple of seasoned pros to see if a judge can tell the difference. It was actually pretty cool, so I might have to watch that show again some time...  Anyway, I'm off now. I think I'll be home soon.  Current Music: Cranberries - Linger

      Well, I just wanted to make one more post before I go to bed... not much to say, though.  Actually, I might not go to bed. I haven't quite decided yet... I probably will, though. Whatever. I don't have anything better to do.  I'm supposed to go to Katy's tomorrow for her birthday, and I don't think I can go. She's gonna kill me...  Ok, well, I'm going to either go to bed or find something to do, now.  Current Music: Elton John - Your Song

      Vanilla Sky is a very, very cool movie. I love movies that make you think like that... You know... those movies that the general public absolutely hates, because they're too stupid to understand them? The only movies like that that get any respect are the film festival ones, because they're often expected to be weird. Meh, whatever. Society sucks, anyway.

      Well, my parents went to the Folklife Festival,  whereas I did not. Nate wants me to help with his periodic table, Martin wants me  to set up a webpage for him, and I want to do my english  homework... I suppose I can fit that all into one  day.

      I don't know what it is, but I love this  hat... It's like the ultimate driving hat, and it adds  just the right amount of character...  I suppose it's the one thing that gives  my average outfit a little boost, and makes me actually have a unique  appearance. It's funny, though, because I usually hate wearing hats, but this  one is mass comfortable and everything.  Right, well, that's that. I just went to the store  to get donuts and Whoop Ass... I'm set for tomorrow morning. My parents want me  to go to the Folklife Festival in Seattle tomorrow, and I haven't quite decided  if I want to go..  Meh. I think I'll go back to working on that  website.

      Yeah... the networking class is awesome. I'm glad I didn't let the prison resemblence fool me. The parking lot sucks, and I'm really not so sure about the school, but the class itself is like sugar-coated... ethernet cables... or something. Anyway, I'm in the server group, installing and running Windows 2003 Server to create a domain for the rest of the class. There's also the Windows Xp Group, who connect to the network or something, and then the Network group, who actually program the routers and run the ethernet cables around and stuff. And then there's the Hardware group, who apparently put computers together. We already have a bunch of working computers, but I guess we'll have more or something.  Anyway, I'm off to... well, I was going to sleep, but that wasn't really working, so instead I'm just laying on the floor. It's all good either way, though. So, yes. Until tomorrow.

      Well, we stayed up really late last night playing an insanely boring game of Starcraft. It was a special map, as opposed to original... you start with a single marine, as does everyone else. There are zerg and protoss computers all around the outside of the map, and five invincible bunkers in the middle. So, each player gets their own bunker to hide in. Also, if you stand in the center of the map, it's a healing zone, so you can just stand there and hit the stim pack button if there isn't too much stuff attacking, and you'll be able to hold it off. Finally, there's an array of buildings around the outside of the center (so not as far out as the enemies) and they all have corresponding beacons. So, if your unit stands on a beacon, you control the building and you can build more units or upgrade. The only way you get money to do that is by killing things. Finally, to finish the game, someone has to make it to one of the 4 crystals in the corners of the map, which are insanely well guarded.  Long game.  Ok, I'm going to my brother's house today, and won't be back until late tomorrow, so everyone have fun doing whatever you're doing.

      That game was so fucking awesome. I almost wish I hadn't beat it, just so I could still be stuck deep down in the plot, ignorant to everything around me. That game changed the way I think, it was so cool. Also, I've decided that the people at Ubisoft are my gods. I'm going to build an altar and worship them. Fuck, I wanna work there... Splinter Cell, XIII, and now Prince of Persia. Ubisoft is on top of things.  You know, it was really revolutionary. Not only did it make you think from start to finish through the puzzles (mindless puzzles have been all the rage lately), which were the core element of the game, but the plot was a rollercoaster of heart twinges, satisfied sighs, and tears of joy. Some people play games for the action, some people for the challenge, some for the story. I play for the story. Any game that doesn't have good character development and a wicked plot is meaningless to me. Like Spyhunter... that was interesting, because they attempted to have a plot built into a racing game--big mistake. That game was horrible.  More babbling, because I'm still awestruck XIII -- a beautifully rendered identity crisis with plot twists so awesome it makes your head spin. Totally my kind of game. Splinter Cell -- Stealth action redefined. I love being sneaky, and Splinter Cell was the first stealth game to really  take the initiative to offer oodles of movement options (split jumps, zip lines, etc.) and still keep a clean interface. Prince of Persia -- The ultimate puzzle game/the ultimate time travel game (in a way)/the ultimate story-driven game. Even if it didn't have any replay value (which it does) I would have to buy it anyway, just because it would be blasphemy not to.  You know what, this is crap, and I'm tired, so I'll just post tomorrow when I'm awake, and my heart has returned to a normal rhythm.

      Now I remember what I like about summer... I really missed sleeping in.  Anyway, I got some good StarCraft in last night with Nate... eventually the game got so drawn out that we gave up due to boredom... it was pretty bad. I also did a lot of taxi missions yesterday on GTA3... that was cool.  Other than that, I really haven't done anything, but I'm going out today to do stuff.

      Ah, yes. I forgot I had to wait for this download to finish, so I'll just waste some more time.  I finally installed Office XP on this computer, so I don't have to use WordPad anymore... I hate that program. Notepad is awesome, of course, but the lack of text formatting doesn't cut it for school assignments. Word is definitely cooler than WordPad...  Anyway, with it came Outlook, which I haven't used in a long time, but I got it all wired up and suddenly I'm really organized. It's crazy, and I love it. I started remaking my address book, as I've done many a time, and I put tons of stuff in the calendar, like things that are coming up, and birthdays, and anniversaries, and more. I'd forgotten how good it feels to have your time all organized.  Right, well, the download is almost done, so I'm going to check up on a couple LJs and then go to bed.

      I apologize for being a bit slow on the updating, but I've been working hard. Actually, today I went and drove around and had a bit of fun. I never realized Computer Concepts had such kickass prices on games. I got Decent II, Gunman, Dark Earth, Phantasmagoria, and Rebel Assault II all for $5. It was grand.  Yes, anyway. I took apart our launcher and redid most of it with string, and it looks so much better, it's crazy. It's not quite finished, but we've got a couple of class days, so I'll finish tying it up in class tomorrow, and then we can calibrate it with a piece of string. I'll be redoing the blueprint on the computer tomorrow, to make sure it is perfect, because that's what I do.  Right, finally, I played a bit of StarCraft today, with Nate, Matt, and Kyle, and I must say I've missed our big 2 vs. 2 games... they're really a lot of fun.

Actually, I took one of the blurry pictures of Amber and played with it, and it turned out massively cool. It was actually a stem of a stem of an idea, so the original idea will have to be played with. The second stem made its way onto devart as well, but it's not nearly as cool.  Right, well. I'm off to bed. Oh, Juli's answering machine is awesome.  Current Music: Outsider - Your Love

      Well, I just intentionally dug myself in a deeper hole with Katy, and I'm not sure why. I seem to be slowly killing myself via other people, or something. It's crazy. Anyway, I've decided that I'm going to force myself into being a loner next year, so I can get a 4.0... I get too caught up in everything and nothing when I've got this many friends. So I'll just die my hair and wear different clothes, and disappear off the face of the earth. It'll be awesome. Actually, I probably won't, but I was seriously thinking about cutting and dying my hair. It might be interesting.  Anyway, I'm off to kill myself. Hah! No, I don't even think I could contemplate suicide, and it's not because of self-esteem, trust me. Right, well. Bye!  Current Music: No Doubt - Just A Girl

      Yeah, wow. Ok. I dunno. Tegan is apparently  asleep... pretty early if you ask me. Anyway, I'm off to watch a movie with my  parents, even though I've seen it before.... I just went to Home Depot and got some really cool  earmuffs, and then to Dairy Queen, where they apparently have an extremely bad  night crew... I ordered a banana split (drive-thru), and I pulled up to the  window and the lady tries to hand it to me in a dish with the spoon all stuck in  it and everything. Like I'm going to eat it while I'm driving. Possible, but  very unlikely. Anyway, I kinda gave her a funny look and said, "Can I get a lid  and a bag?", "Oh, alright". She hands me the banana split and has me hold it  while she goes and gets the lid and the bag, and then just hands me the lid and  the bag and closes the window... I'm like, oh great. So, upon attempting to put  the lid on, I find that it's actually another bottom piece, so they don't even  fit together... So I just crammed it together, stuck it in the bag and hoped for  the best... maybe she was new or something...

At least I'm getting that much more practice.  The way I was originally going to shade the picture didn't look very good, so  I'm trying something new, and it'll probably look like crap, but I'll just keep  working on it until I get it...

I also downloaded Sacrifice, a game I had played once before, and I must say it's a very cool game, although I don't think I'll ever overcome the confusions of the interface... it's a strategy game, where you control different units and such, but it's from the third-person, where you are a wizard controlling all of your units. Also, you can summon, cast spells and so on--the usual stuff. Anywho, it has great graphics and very interesting gameplay, but it's hard... hehe.    Whatever. I'm going to go make myself busy.

      You know... death should always be a possible side-effect. Of course, I suppose they only include the ones that are a direct cause of the product. But, for example, something that may cause drowsiness could cause you to fall asleep while driving or walking on a narrow catwalk.  Of course, then they'd have to include every possible way that falling asleep could kill you... fall asleep and drown, fall asleep and fall off of a train platform, etc.  It's amazing the kinds of things people get away with in court these days. It's crazy, because it's not like they could make small claims a thing of the past, because then people would just start shooting each other, or whatever they could do.

If Rhino were free, I would be happy... and Milkshape would be a nice freebie, too. 3ds Max would of course be a lovely freebie, since the retail price still runs at about $3000. Of course, GMax is like the same program as far as the actual interface goes, and that's the one thing I don't like about Blender. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

Last night I decided that there was no way in hell I'd ever use all 4 bays, and then I realized that a fan would fit perfectly in two of them, so voila. I also made a  urlLink cheap little baffle  out of printer paper to guide the airflow to the cpu a bit better... that's why I decided I might not get that fan.

      Yeah, I haven't updated in a bit. Meh. Still the usual stuff going on.  We took our first test in nt class... that was interesting. Nate got 30 some percent, Christian got two or three more than him, and somehow I got a 44%, tying the previous class record. Beautimous. Anyway, I just went and saw King Arthur... that was interesting. Pretty good overall, but it was iffy in places.

      Yeah, now I've got 4 clients going, and it was pretty much error free and easy-going. Of course, there was a power failure on one half of the room, so all we had running for a little bit was our 3 servers, the 4 WinXP computers, and the class server, which is run by Mr. P Anyway... not much else going on, other than that. We're pretty much on the first test, now, after one last instructor check tomorrow. He kept rebooting the server for some reason, so we couldn't do much, because our servers are running as child domains of the central domain. I'll just say it wasn't helpful.  I'm going now, so yeah.  Current Music: Aliz√©e - A Contre-Courant

      I went crazy and split my hard drives into millions of partitions. Actually, I'm not quite sure how many there are, but including cd and image drives I'm up to M: I'll go count how many there are... Ah. Nine. Quite a bit more than I need, but not more than I can make use of. Anyway, I'm going to go frolic some more...

      Ok, the internet is working again, although it's a bit slower than usual. But it works! Hah!  Anyway, yes. I suppose I'm just happy that it's working... Oh, I fixed the power supply deal, too... so, yes.

      Apparently I lied, because it broke right after I made that last post. Anyway, I'm at my sister's house now, with the semi-acceptable combination of slow computer and fast internet. Verizon must not have completely blown up, because they're providing properly here, but it is quite a distance from home.  Right, well, off I will be.

      Looks like my internet isn't freaking out anymore. It's been really slow for the past two days, and I couldn't connect to anything. Anyway, I'm fixing my power supply problem right now, and I have a secret project going right now. It'll be very cool.  Anywho, I think I'm going to unplug pretty soon and work on the power problem.

      Morning it be... well, late morning. Anyway, I'm still running on two power supplies, and I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do about it. I'm either going to make a little modification so I can mount that power supply inside my computer, and have two power cords (that would be pretty cool.... hehe) or I could buy a converter from whatever to peripheral or I could just cut off my floppy plug and grab a peripheral one from an old power supply and put it on there. Oh, or there's the new power supply idea.  The last two sound like the best ideas, but the first one sounds like it would be cool... two power supplies... hehe. Anyway, I'm not going to work on that until later today. For now, I'm just going to run it with the case open, and overclock my video card some more.

      I'm lovin' this fan controller... I don't know if I mentioned before, but I have to use two power supplies to run the fan controller, because I was short one power plug. I was thinking about getting a little converter to go from floppy to normal peripheral so I can plug it in there. That would be convenient, since I don't have a floppy drive anyway, and I don't plan to.  Current Music: Foo Fighters - Low

      The fan beasts have been silenced... somewhat. It's pretty hot stuff, but it unfortunately requires two power supplies, because my 400 w is short a single 4-pin peripheral plug. It's awesome, nonetheless... and now I've got that nifty dashboard thing on the front of my pc.  Anyway, I'm off again.  Current Music: Stray Cats - Stray Cat Strut

      Interestingly enough, in the process of fixing my hard drive I actually lowered my cpu temperature a good 8 degrees. I also have my partitions optimized for speed, now, and the fans are all a bit quieter.  Anyway, yay to that!  Current Music: Franz Ferdinand - The Dark of the Matin√©e

      And on a somewhat normal sleeping schedule. I got up at 4 this morning... yay! Yes, anyway... I had to fix my computer, because XP got written over in the process of fixing Nate's computer, and that hdd stopped responding for a little while. I think it was an ego problem... 1.59 million mb seems a bit large. Anyway, I finally got it back, and I'm back in business, here.  Now I'm web shopping... hehe...

      I'm tired again. Granted, not as tired as before, but still a bit tired. My eyes are really dry, too.... hmm... Anyway, the caffeine lasted just about as long as it was supposed to, but, unfortunately, I don't have any more. So, now I can just sit here and.... yeah. I'm installing SP1 right now, and it's really slow. Yeah. Ok.  Current Music: Simple Minds - Don't You

      This is like the super drug. I suddenly feel wide awake, albeit a bit more clumsy than usual. I hope I don't randomly crash... of course, if I do, we'll have a conclusion for the second experiment. Closure is good.

      Ok, I say screw the chair one, because I'm pretty sure it's not going to work. So, onto the caffeine. Excuse me while I go take inventory. ................................................ Ok, all is well. I've got a can of whoop ass (literally). So, the experiment officially begins at 1:22.

      I think I'll take advantage of my current state and make it into a science experiment. First Experiment: Sleeping Upright I hypothesize, of course, that there's no way in hell I'm going to pull it off, unless I'm in the shower. But I've already taken a shower this morning, and I'm not about to take another one in the name of useless science. Anyway, I'm too tired to stand up, so we'll skip to the next one. Second Experiment: Chair Sleeping I've actually been trying this off and on for the past hour, and I don't believe it's possible to get into any position at all in this chair where I can sleep. I will continue to attempt this one for a while, and fill in the details later. Third Experiment: Caffeine I'll throw this in later when I really start to fall apart. We'll see just how much a little caffeine boost helps out.  Anyway, you can now begin eagerly awaiting the results of said experiments. I'm sure you're on the edge of your seat.

      I just kinda realized that there is no point in my putting titles on these posts... the majority of them are completely random and useless, and very few have any substantial meaning. Of course, I'll continue to use them, but I just thought I'd acknowledge their lack of purpose. Anyway, I figured I'd just update every few minutes until I get bored with that and go elsewhere.

      Hmm... I just saw my clock in the mirror, and it said 12:51... and then I turned around, and it said the same thing. Nifty. Anyway, I keep catching myself gazing at my bed, or at that pile of soft stuff over there, or whatever... It's really hard to will myself not to go to bed... mind over matter, eh?

Anyway, I went back to Ground Control and beat a couple more missions there, as well... I haven't played games in a while, so I'm quite enjoying myself, now. I just need to get someone else playing GC so we can play online. Heh. Heh. Heh. Yes, anyway. I'm off again.  Current Music: Sarah McLachlan - Sweet Surrender
