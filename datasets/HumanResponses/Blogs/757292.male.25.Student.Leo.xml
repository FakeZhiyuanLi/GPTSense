       Rocking out to "Chanbra" by At The Drive-In is the new cute.  It was good for me too.

       Went to play softball in a nearby city today for the 'Wendy's Extreme Baseball Tournament" and now my body is killing me. Both sides of my stomach, shoulder blades, the right bicept, my thighs and parts of my legs are all sore as heck. Was it worth it? Not really, but we finished in second place and got medals, so that was amusing. My co-worker Matt kept everyone entertained with his slightly offensive sense of humour, but it was amusing nonetheless.  When I arrived home it was super nice to find some birthday greetings by some really great people. Thumbs up to that.

       Today was my first radio show. The Fibonacci Sequence is a go! Overall, it was just an amazing day.

       After watching some special recounting the music of the 1990s, I long to flash back to 1994 when the Smashing Pumpkins were still around. At the same time, I feel really old. Just like when I'm sitting in Phog and they're playing all the grunge hits of yesteryear.

       This moment of clarity.  When trying to catch this bus you usually get there 30 minutes early, or just miss it by two minutes and have to wait another hour for the next one. Not one for standing around in the cold, I took the next available bus, which remotely travels in the area near my house, and prepare myself for the 30 minute walk ahead of me. Final destination. Exit the bus. Thank common sense for telling me to put on a sweater before leaving the house. Headphones and mini disc player on. Hood over top and jacket zipped up as far as it can go. Begin journey.  I'm not one who minds walking or even running home, especially when it's really warm out. I'll walk any distance and the people who know me well recognize the extent of this statement. There's something about traveling long distance by foot, which makes me feel alive. On a normal day I'm blessed with numerous vehicular-based modes of transportation and I never get the sense that my body is being put to good use. Walking homes changes all of that. It seems like my breathing opens up, and I love the burn as fresh air flows through my nasal cavity. Tonight the cold air made my face numb in an almost pleasurable way, and my legs were burning with pins & needles.   At the same time, my mind was churning more thoughts per minute than usual. Cutting through that empty field I could only see small islands of grass glowing under lights lining the nearby highway. Pitch black mud everywhere else as I tried to keep my feet on top of the fluffy grass. It was like a mini game during my trek.  As I entered my home sweet suburbia, my voyeuristic side was tempted. The dark streets and the interior lighting of each house made it easy to see inside the majority of the buildings. What did I observe? People really love to watch TV. What an eye-opener, huh?

       For the past year or so I've given up on online journals. Specifically my dulledsenses Livejournal because people kept using the information against me, so I just deleted everything. That was a mistake because all my memories are gone except for one. It was persistent for sure and would not delete due to some encoding problem. It was also an entry that I didn't write, but rather someone else's words used to describe a shared experience. In a way, I'm glad I wasn't able to get rid of it.  Since then I've created the ourmovieyear Livejournal, which I only use to write about films. In these entries I also try to explain how I relate to elements of these films, with hopes that it will help myself and others understand me. I'm not sure how effective it is, but it's still a fun way to get some writing done.  I've also made a few random pieces of writing, which I never published online until now. These would have been journal entries, but for some reason, I feared that the content wasn't meant to be accessible. Today that changed as they can be found below.   Today we had a band from Winnipeg come into the studio to perform some music live on-air. I stood between two amps watching the mic output levels while these two musicians created abrasive music that could be the soundtrack to a nightmare. I mean that in the best way possible. During that time, I got to wondering if previous events in my life were different, if I would still be the same. Previous people who were influences on my life have come and gone after varying lengths of time. No doubt they have each left their mark. So basically I was wondering if some of those influences who were only around for a few months would have drastically affected my life assuming I had the priviledge of knowing them for longer. Maybe I would have been living in Vancouver without any sort of post-secondary education. Maybe I would have been living in the GTA just trying to get by with a couple of minimum wage jobs. Maybe I would have been living in Windsor with a similar situation minus a steady girlfriend. Around this moment I snapped out of my daze while the music continually assaulted my ears. The story to this moral: I miss all the previous participants in my life, and I really wish they showed some interest in still knowing me regardless of our differences.

       I think I am suffering from a case of technological distraction. Or maybe technological depression. I blame the "Reading Week" break for knocking me off my scholastic track, in combination with all the technological distractions around me, and my procrastinating personality.   Currently there are two papers that I must write. I have all the necessary information placed in a relatively logical order, but I cannot find the motivation to put this knowledge into my own words. All the pieces are there, but I don't want to put together these puzzles. Putting together that Lord of the Rings 3D puzzle at Toys R Us on Boxing Day was more than enough puzzling for me. I got home around 2pm and it's going on 9 hours later, but I only have 2 paragraphs to show for myself. I'd like to credit this success to my laptop, my television, my PS2, and NCAA College Football 2004 (where I set a record for sacking the opposing quarterbacks 102 times in one season with one player). Call me Brody, but this ain't Mallrats.  So I could have finished a lot of things with my time, but I didn't. It makes me feel like a failure in a sense because I was highly motivated while taking the bus home from school this afternoon. Then it all died. I'm more of a thinker than a person who makes actions happen. This I have to deal with.   That's the technological distraction. Where the technological depression comes in. I'm not exactly sure. For one thing, I think it started around 8:30 this morning on a completely different note. I try to sit near the front of the class in the Contemporary Europe course because I figure it keeps me away from the people who aren't there to pay complete attention to the lectures. This nerdy guy and girl always position themselves near me, and as the days pass, they speak to each other louder and louder during lectures. I wish I could turn my ear off, or focus it so I can only hear the professor, but instead I pick up every sound in the room. Especially them. I shot them the "evil eye" twice, and a guy one row in front of us did the same, but to no avail. I asked them if they would keep it down, but that only worked for 37 seconds before they started laughing. I didn't know imperial expansion in Europe was funny. It was especially hilarious when all the Asians were slaughtered in the Boxer Rebellion during the early 1900s, wasn't it? So that was the first spark towards lighting my match today.  The second spark came during a philosophy class. I sat in my usual seat with two empty seats to my right. Halfway through the class, some girl came in late and sat in the chair two seats away. Overall, the class focuses on the professor giving us lots of time to attempt random examples of reasoning and logic. After about 2 minutes, people start talking about random bullshit. I got really drunk last night. Me too. I love your hair. You like my new bag too? Oh thanks so much. My boyfriend broke up with me over the phone after 6 years of dating. Can you believe it? Today the late girl called her friend's name (she was sitting two rows in front of us) and she proceeded to turn around to talk in a language foreign to me. I could tell they were talking about my laptop bag which I had sitting on the other empty desk because the classroom was mostly deserted today. Instead of the girl in the row closest to the front moving her things off the empty desk beside her, they asked me to move my things so her friend could come over. I agreed and asked them if they would please not talk too loud because I have trouble concentrating. That didn't work. For the next 10 minutes they talked and laughed with each other in the language foreign to me. When the professor walked by, they pretended to be discussing the work, but obviously they weren't doing that the whole time. I mean, the example we were examining revolved around nuclear holocaust. How could anyone be laughing at that? I'm venting. Basically I don't understand why people must be so distracting in places of learning. If you're there to socialize, you obviously can do that elsewhere.   As one might be able to tell, at this point, I wasn't happy with people. This is where the technological depression sets in. Some guy pulls out one of his 2-way radio/walkie talkie things in class and starts having a conversation with a friend somewhere else nearby. Annoying as that is, it was made more annoying by the horrible beeping noises that occur after every message is sent or received. Also, why is it necessary to use a device like that to make plans with your friend in the middle of a class. Can't people wait a few minutes for class to be over, and discuss these things in person? I have the same gripe with cellphones.  Speaking of which, on the bus ride home, some guy was nice enough to be talking on his cell phone very loudly. Fine, it's a public bus and you can do what you want, but do you really need to let everyone else hear your conversation? It was the most pathetic attempt at conversation too. First he calls his friend to ask, "Yo, did I leave my wallet there last night? You sure? Don't lie to me. A'ight. Well I'm gonna be there in 10 minutes so be ready to go." Phone call #2 occurs a couple minutes later. "Hey. Check on top of the fridge. I think it's up there. You sure? If you're lying I'm gonna kick your ass. Yeah whatever. Peace." Phone call #3. 5 minutes later. "What's up? I'm just about to get off the bus so meet me outside. What? You ain't ready yet? What's taking you so long? Fuck man! I wanted to get this shit done so we could get high before work. A'ight, well just hurry up man. Cya." Did one really need to make all those phone calls to the same person within the span of a few minutes? Was it really that necessary to spew out those sentence fragments for everyone else to hear, or could you have waited?   I'm getting more and more lost here. Overall, it has been one of those days where I'm thinking way too much, finding all kinds of flaws and problems, not getting enough done, and getting depressed for no reason. The only things I decided are:  1] I really need to train my ear to selectively hear certain things. 2] Now that my education is finally broadening my horizons, I need to put it to good use. 3] I need to get these papers done. 4] I'd like to play a game of pick-up basketball or softball to get my body going and to feel alive. Fresh air, sweat, and physical contact.  5] I really want to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm.

       I'm slowly turning into a curmudgeon and disliking the types of people who live in Windsor. Maybe it's just not isolated to this city, but I've been noticing a lot of people who act more hip than thou, grown up rich-kid snobs, cultural chameleons and those who consume pop culture like it was gospel. I wish I had some kind of artistic ability to vent this frustration, so anyone with said abilities is reading this, I'm jealous of you.

       Today was technically my first day of summer vacation. It's already started off on a negative vibe. Last summer I was blessed with two jobs, and when I was laid off of one, I laughed as it happened. Well my friends, karma is a bitch because thus far I am unemployed and have been that way for about 4 months now. While I'm certainly sitting comfortable with enough to pay for my tuition next year and rent as well, it just seems so weird to have all this time on my hands and a lack of an incoming monetary source.   Most of the day was spent inheriting a tonne of stress, which I really don't need. Things were looking good during the border crossing to the Moneen show. Upon arrival, no names were on the guestlist and the show was sold out. A sold out Moneen show in Detroit was certainly a shocker considering the show they played last month was poorly attended and the few crowd members were really getting into their music. Regardless, these events were probably for the best so I can't be too mad about the outcome. It still would have been nice to see those young men from Brampton headline a show tonight.  As a nice surprise, when I got home I found out that my Numbers/Les Georges Lenningrad/The Sick Lipstick poster by SeriPop had arrived in the mail. So I look forward to getting it framed tomorrow and hanging it on my wall because this apartment definitely needs some wall decorations.  "my soul is weak / my eyes are blind / my father drove me on / it's nothing more than dust and ash / the day my friend was gone.

       the other night the power in our house and neighborhood went out. normally this is not a completely uncommon occurrence, but it seemed to be a more major blackout than normal. i felt an urgent feeling of uncomfortableness similar to what I might feel if I was in a horror movie. at any minute, a killer could walk through my door and end my life. it was a very eerie feeling for sure, but I wonder what brought it on?  once the power came back on, i felt a bit more safe as the glow from my cable modem illuminated the room slightly. in the backyard, a strong light was glowing which I never noticed until now. i had to look out my window. not knowing would kill me. however, another strange feeling swept over my body. this time I expected to see someone nailed to the fence surrounding our hot tub in the jesus christ pose. a backyard martyr for all intents and purposes. luckily the backyard was empty except for a heavy coat of snow paving the lawn.   finally i could go to sleep. and yes, i am still considered mentally sane.

       i want to talk about a blatant rip off. moments ago I heard the song "Mad World" by Gary Jules playing on a TV downstairs and I instantly thought, "Donnie Darko must be on!" When I turned on my TV and found the channel in question, suddenly my interest and high died. A random cop drama was using the song, which isn't a problem. the problem is: the image style, fades and editing were absolutely and completely ripped off from Donnie Darko too. surely creating a somewhat original mis en scene can't be that difficult.  no idea is original, but at least try to do something unique.

       she strikes back with a vengeance once again. i wish i was documenting these entries while keeping score of what day I wrote them because it seems like she is getting into my head more and more frequently. it's a good and bad thing. on the negative side, i don't need any negative distractions from Christina. life is easier when tests of love aren't involved. on the positive tip, i still want to know her and not let a friendship slip through my fingers. the distance makes it nearly impossible. and a potential lack of interest makes it scary to even think about the prospect of contacting her. am i a ghost or skeleton in the closet? or was i just a sock that was misplaced in a messy bedroom but temporarily forgotten about until it accidentally reappears? hopefully the later, but likely the former.  vague statements turned my stomach upside down and inside out all at once. vague statements were always a specialty and i mean that in the best way possible. sometimes it wasn't fun trying to decipher them, but in hindsight, they were always genius.

       I keep having the same dream in which a former associate and I are very playfully teasing each other while running back and forth between rooms in my old house like children. Basically she and I are flirting in a major way, but neither of us is totally revealing our true intent or emotions. It's frustrating in one sense, but incredibly joyous and fun the next. Although I know it's a dream, the whole experience is one of the most fun-filled moments I can remember.  Painfully though, I look for her latest online manifestos and get disappointed when the "he" being mentioned isn't a reference to me.
