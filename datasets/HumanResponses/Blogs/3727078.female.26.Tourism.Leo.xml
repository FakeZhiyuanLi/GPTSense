						   Teams,  I’ve spoken to Mel about this and we have decided in the spirit of good fun that we are going to have an internal competition between LOTR and the Star Wars team. Both teams will compete on these metrics and compare our scores against each other:  POSE  AQS  AHT  Hold  Attendance    Metric scores will be based on the OVERALL team average. The team that wins in the most metrics will be considered champion for the month. The winner gets a free dinner or lunch which will be paid by the losing team. The mechanics is simple:   Breakdown of competing teams:  LOTR                   vs.                 Star Wars  Anton Formoso                              Mel Montano Allan Flores                               Conrad Lee Ramon Benipayo                             Chris Marasigan April Ponce                                Nikki Abanto Neil Vargas                                Alfie de los Santos Alex Constantino                           Michelle Espiritu Mark Catabian                              Jay Licas  Mel has two more TLs under his team which are Mark Carpio and Rhea Garcia; however, they will not be included in the game as they have new teams.  When: Start of game is July 1, ends on July 31  Miscellaneous Rules:  Trash talk is allowed hehe. However, any TL of either LOTR or Star Wars which is found as being unsportsmanlike (i.e pikon) will be taken out of the game. If two or more TLs or at least one OM is/are found as unsportsmanlike will void the whole game.       Let’s have fun doing this and always remember we are doing this for the program and to finally determine which team is the best!!!  For any comments or suggestions to improve the game please reply to this e-mail. Thanks and good luck to the Star Wars team – you’re going to need it hehehehhehehehehehheheh

						   Hey guys!  This idea to put up a public messaging board came from Team Erendil. Kudos to you guys! Anyway, this is a free for all LOTR messaging board -- which means you can say what you want and I promise it will not be taken against you. However, some rules to remember:  1. No profanity 2. No verbal abuse  3. No fighting 4. No pornography  These things I will not tolerate. However, praises, comments, suggestions, rant, raves, concerns, whatever, is welcome. I hope you guys will be diligent in checking the posts here as some of them will contain important updates. By the way, if anyone is interested in modifying/beautifying/etc. this message board, just tell me so I can let you do it. Let's make it nice and easy to read ok. Thanks!  Anton
