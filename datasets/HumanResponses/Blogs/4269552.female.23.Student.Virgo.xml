      Date: August 16, 2004 From: The Ex-Girlfriend of the Guy i am Screwing (EGGS) To: all her friends and family Subject: [Mr. NYU] and I..  Mom, Dad, Grandma, all…  I can't imagine having to do this more than once or to have to actually verbalize the following, so I am sending one email to all. Forgive the impersonal nature but I can’t bear to get on the phone with each of you and try to explain this between sobs. Today, on my birthday, Mr. NYU ended our four-year relationship. Of course this came as a shock to me as when I last saw him in LA he was very much in love and even asked me to extend my stay with him, which I did. In fact, we had talked several times prior to his departure about how strong we felt, thus the bomb he dropped has hurt like nothing I have ever known. I tried to make sense of it and questioned and pried which was finally followed by an admission that while in LA this summer he began seeing a woman named [name deleted]. [name deleted] is included on this email as I saw it fit being that she was well aware of our relationship and apparently wanted to be involved in it regardless of his commitment to me. So, since she has recently played a huge role, there is no sense in excluding her now.I know that you all will want to call and talk but I just can’t do that now. I need to get my life together and find a place to live. If anyone has spare appliances, utensils, or a bed, I would be so appreciative. I will be in touch soon.  [EGGS]  ----------------------------- Date: August 17, 2004 From: The Responder To: EGGS Subject: Re: [Mr. Nyu] and I…  Dear EGGS,  Let me begin by thanking you for taking the time to include me in your mass mailings. I also greatly appreciate the messages you have left on my voicemail.  Next, let me extend my sympathies. It must really suck to be as crazy and delusional as you are. Four-years? That’s a bit of an exaggeration, isn’t it? Isn’t more like three? Oh that’s right, you don’t like the number three number because you owe Mr. NYU three grand. And that also explains why you didn’t ask him to “buy you out of the relationship” for three thousand dollars and instead asked for five.  Now, because you’ve taken the time to include me in your list of family and friends, I hope you will accept a little friendly advice. If you want to keep a man, try to NOT do the following:  --Ask him about marriage every other day. --Sort through his personal stuff. --Fake suicide attempts. --Call up his friends and ask them for dirt on your boyfriend. --Get your female friend, who is dating his best friend, to break into her boyfriend’s e-mail account so you can read all their correspondence. --T hreaten to throw his shit away, destroy his property or injure his person when you are discussing the future of your relationship  There’s a lot more I could advise you on. But since my time is billed at insanely expensive rates, I’ll leave you with just a few tips on what you should do, before I go back to my motions, briefs and whatnot, and make some money for the prestigious law firm at which I work.  --First, get a fucking job. Part of the reason he dumped you is that you are too expensive to keep around. --Second, stop watching so much daytime television; that shit rots your brain. --Third, I know you are in therapy, but maybe you should consider actually following your shrink’s advice, as you have been seeing him for years and are still nutzoid. --Fourth, be careful of who you fuck over. Not every one is as restrained as I am.  Well. That’s it for now. Sorry I didn’t respond to you sooner. I admit that I am not a great correspondent, but that doesn’t mean I am not thinking about you. In fact, I have created a special folder in my inbox just for your messages. It’s titled, “TRO.” I guess Mr. NYU didn’t always share the details of his life with you, and he didn’t talk much about his legal studies (perhaps because it bored you?). But, as a friend, I’ll take the time to tell you that TRO stands for “Temporary Restraining Order.” And that’s exactly what I will file if you don’t leave me the fuck alone, you crazy bitch.  Sincerely, The Responder

      Sure, we are all fans of McSweeney's " urlLink Open Letters to People or Entities Who Are Unlikely to Respond ," but what about open responses?  Recently I was bombared by e-mails sent from the crazy ex-girlfriend of the guy I am currently dating. I really wanted to retalliate, but I knew that would only esclatate the matter and make me look bad. Still, I have all these mock responses and no place to send them. Seems like a waste of good sarcasm, no?  Then my friend recieved an e-mail from a former professor (with whom she was having an affair) asking her to write a "letter of recommendation" for a new job he was applying for. This asshole, lied to her, broke her heart, dumped and then acted as nothing happened and now he's asking for a letter of recommendation? She's too nice to write the kind of letter she wants to. But wouldn't it be great if she could post it some where?  And there are other scenarios as well. Has a boss written you up for something at work and you are dying to respond? Has an ex-boyfriend sent you a really ridiculous e-mail and you need to vent? Well, this is the forum for you. Please send both the original e-mail and your ficitious response to  urlLink openresponses@hotmail.com   All real names will be changed to protect the innocent and the guilty. If there are is a particular psuedo name you want to use for any of the persons please indicate that.  Yours Truly,  The Responder
