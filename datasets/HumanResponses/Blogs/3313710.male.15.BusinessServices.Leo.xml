      This download is my personal best firewall.  It is Zone Alarm Pro 4.5.  I have tried many other firewalls, including Norton, but this has to be the best. Download Zone Alarm Pro 30 day trial from the link.  Install that and then search the internet for a registration code. Perfectly legal? Yeah-Right!!!  My favorite site for cracks and regristration codes is "CrackSpider."  You should be able to find the URL.  The download should start automatically.   urlLink Click here to Download Zone Alarm Pro 4.5 Trial

      Today's download of the day is Kazaa Lite K++ edition. It is my favorite P2P network, file sharing software. It is like Kazaa, but made from a completely different company. Unlike the normal Kazaa, you have the option to disable file sharing. It does not have any&nbsp;of those annoying ad banners or pop ups. One other feature that it has, is a RIAA blocker. I don't know if it does any good, but it's better than nothing.   The download should start automatically.    urlLink Click here to Download Kazaa Lite K++ Edition

      How many people have a long list of favorites that not organized at all? This is a good of time as any to clean them up. Create folders and subfolders to make them organized. It might take a little time to do this now, but it will save you a lot of time later. After they are cleaned out, run this freeware to check for any "dead links." With the way that websites change frequently, this is a good utility to have on hand. *I apologize for being a day behind.

      This is my favorite "Data Destruction" freeware.  It is called Eraser.  It writes binary code over files (zeros and ones) so that it cannot be read.  Then it removes it from the hard drive.  When you send an item to the recycling bin and then empty it, it is similar to tearing the table of contents out of a book.  It doesn't actually delete the file, but it makes it extremely hard to find.  With eraser, it's gone for good.  After it's installed, to use the program, you just have to right click on a file and select erase. It's that simple.  Here is the download link. *I apologize for being a couple days behind.
