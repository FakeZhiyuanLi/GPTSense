      First let me say that i am a proud card carrying democrat. I would also like to try to dispell the rumors that only republicans have moral, hold their families above all and are against abortion. To that end I would also like to state that while I am against abortion I am fully in support of a womans right to choose, also the state and church have no place in her choice.&nbsp;I am a family man and i put nothing above them they are my reason for living, I put up with what i put up with because of them for them. Republicans always try to take the high moral ground they are no different from anyone else. For those who state that they are they are simpletons. Dont listen to the American biased press and make your choices, do your research listen to NPR (The Most Unbiased Form of News In the World). Use the web just do your research and thats if you vote democrat or republican.

      I dont know why i can't stop thinking about this man, His actions have been criminal at the least. First with the help of his brother he stole the election from the country almost 4 years ago. Then over a year ago aided by 9/11 he lied the country into war. Are the live that have been lost in Iraq murder? I think they are, when a president willingly lies to the people to promote his own agenda, and lives are lost this is atleast treason. He is not an honarable man, he rather campaign under the veil of religion and moral values. But what moral values has he shown. I think its about time that we all stop listening to his disgeniune rhetoric and put the power with someone else. I cant imagine another 4 years of George W. And for anyone that thinks i dont support our men and women serving in Iraq you have no idea, i still think they are serving&nbsp; our country and the world proudly.

      Welcome to my friggin blog hopefull i will use this to cast my rants and raves. By the Way George Bush lied and our kids are dying!! Forget everything else that is what has happend.... Dont let him steal this election. For those Ralph Nader supporters the question you still have to ask yourself is Do you want to make a statement with your vote for Ralph Nader and help elect George W. Bush or should you vote for the person that you would rather have in office. I am not telling you not to vote for Ralph Nader, you are an american and have the right to vote for whomever you please. Just please look at the big picture.

      I would like to personally thank each and every soldier that has ever served during a conflict, I would really like to thank all the men in women who are in harms way around the world right now. While your country is fighting over whats right, you continue to serve us all proudly. Don't let the rhetoric for one minute make you think that we all are not hoping for each and every one of yours safe return. I think of you everyday, but I cannot bear to watch the news to see one of your pictures shown on the screen as a fallen soldier. You make me proud everyday your strength, your resolve and your sense of country serve us all very well. Thank You!

      I know Kindergarten is school, but it seems more like preparation for real school. My daughter begins her journey through a life of learning tomorrow. I'm proud, im nervous im a little bit of everything I think this could be the day that changes her life forever, I guess everyday is that. But im really excited, and rightfully so I just hope I can be there for her every little step she takes. Kids are great for times like these, I just have to remember to cherish every little moment like its my last because they grow up so fast. Its a flash......

      The regular television news is so biased and sensationalistic that it makes me want to puke. Politically speaking you can tell when the reporters are pro democrat or republican. Whatever happened to presenting the news and letting people make up there own minds. I detest it, I think people should be informed, stop listening to these nimrod shock jocks on the radio who just spit there own ignorant opinions like they are scholarly. Damn thank god for NPR (National Public Radio) unbiased almost always and an American staple, I actually think most less than 20 %  of Americans even know what it is. If your town does not have a decent station go to NPR.org and listen to the national feed 24-7.

      If you agree with Gay marriage  or not, you have to disagree with the precedence that President Bush trying to set. He is trying to pass federal legislation banning it, this means in the future these peoples rights (if they have any now is a question) will be up to bigoted politicians to decide. No it cannot happen and what about the next group they deem as undesirable, this is comes from the same man that calls his bi-racial grandchild "the brown one". I know it seems like I don’t really like the president, which is not the case he probably is a good man that wants to do what he thinks is best for the country. I just don’t agree with his ideas, and I definitely don’t agree with the way he was elected. You cannot take away a group of people’s rights because you disagree with there stands or morality. The Christian right is playing too much in our politics with the Republican rule. Religion is not a bad thing but it has no place in government policies, this country was founded on Freedom from religious persecution.
