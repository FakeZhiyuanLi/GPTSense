      So this weekend was one of the most weirdest ones ive like ever had... I had a great weekend with my friends, had my party, and so on, but the past few weeks of supressed confusion and stress all blew up huge-"super"- on.... oh say thursday, like all in my head.... At any moment I was ready to complelety crumble and fall apart, and was so frightened that, out of my control it would happen at the most unoppurtune moment...There are so many stressors between Woods, my family, people, and my future that I was just a wreck, having lots o fun yet so suppressed by all these worries and emotions...i felt like I didnt feel as if my life is out of control, but that its out of MY control, if that makes any sense, which is like torture for me...  Anyways, I think i am finally getting better-betters not the word to use.... overcoming? no... lets just say coming to grips with things and dealing, i think im done with the emotions....yeah.... but My friends of mine have been amazing... you know who you are..without you i'd have no one to sort all this out aloud to... I love you and your support and love means the world to me... and i mean that... Being so preoocupied with myself and the stressors, i havent had as much time nor have i felt in the right frame of mind for my quiet times.. and how foolish and self-centered do i feel, that when I resume i immediately feel a rush of a better feeling of content.  God just has a way of revealing things to you on his time, though they seem like revalations of miracles when they occur... I think i sometimes take it all for granted all God's done in my life... Ive gone to First B in STC since I was 4, I was saved when I was 8, and ive always had all the head knowledge...But God still i working on my heart everyday.. Its an on going process that continue forever baaah Theres so much to think about but i'll end with this, a verse that i found written in my notebook from a while ago, though still just as noteworthy for me today.... 1 tim 4:12 Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct,love, faith, and purity, show yourself an example for those who believe. Here goes to a better week with a clearer head and a leveled mind... mmm has that ever been possible for me?? :)

      So,I'm sitting at my house on a Saturday night at 11. Why you ask? My parents are crazy. They wanted me to do all my homwork tonight and they wanted me to "rest". Yea ok. I was kind of bored and don't liek the whole staying at home thing at all. It will not be happening ever again I can gurantee you that. They also will not let me see the Passion of Christ. My mom said she does not want me to witness the violence and I don't need to see it with friends but can go with my family.So whatever, kind of mad about that. So I spent my night making the Taming of the Shrew sign and a cast board for the musical. Which was actually kind of fun and I got to use my "creative talents". Oh well, no teenager should be home on the weekends this is crazy. And no one wants to talk or anytihng becuase there basically all doing stuff. Atleast I won't be home all week. Oh and guess what? Beth lost Wicked for sure. I want to cry.

      I am very sorry if I offended anyone today or seemed angry at anyone. After Pat told me that he thought I was mad at him I realized how much of a bad mood I was in and how it affected the people around me. I am espically sorry to Rachel Lamp becuase when she came to give me a hug I kind of pushed her away and I am sorry. I was just in a terrible mood and so overwelhmed and I took it out on the people around me. I'm sorry to Pam to becuase I did not mean to act the way I did. I have to except the fact that Yomi is an ass, Fantasy festival can not take orders and no matter how much I try I am just always going to be a bit bitter. So I'm sorry if anyone thought I was a bitch towards them. I am going to make this week much better and instead of loathing Yomi and being angry, I will just luagh at how bad he is. Also I have to express how creeped out I am with Chris Williams liking my sister and also Brian having her massage his back. These two things gross me out and make me want to puke. Shes a freshman you losers, lay off. What the heck, go get something some where else. For crying out loud people sure piss me off. But I love you all and now I have to go take a act practice test becuase I forgot to all week. Love you all.

      Sitting at school yet once again. Just finished a lay out project and now I have free time. I really wish I had my history book with me becuase I totally did not study for my history quiz and I'm in so much trouble next hour. I had two peices of cheesecake in choir and now I'm not feeling so good. Why do I consume so much food? I seroiusly have a problem. Oh geez. Ok, so no one answered my question about the toga thing. Well, Richie did but not seroiusly. I need to know guys!! Oh forget it, I'll just call Kacy. I am so excited about Al's. I can almost taste the butterfinger malt. So something  has been bothering this morning  and it is a problem with my neighbors. I have known them since I was four and they have been like a second family. And I thought I knew them well. Well, they have been married for 35 years and Jim(my neighbor) cheated on his wife and they are now getting divorced. Joe(his wife) has locked herself away from the world and is on medication. People have been constantly going over there and checking up on her. My mom checked on her and said she looked awful. So it really makes me think about marriage. Why can't two people stay faithful? Why is it so hard? I really don't understand and it is just another thing that worries me about growing up. I really don't understand. Which brings up another point. Since Bush thinks marriage should only be between a man and a woman,  becuase it sanctifies the meaning of marriage, how come men and woman can not stay together? How does that sanctifie marriage? I don't think it makes a difference what sex you are. There are gay couples that have been together longer then most married couples and stay truthful but a man or woman can not even stay faithful to eachother. What kind of marriage is that? Marriage should be for anyone not just heterosexuals, I don't feel it is right. I'm sorry if I offended anyone but this eally bothers me. I think if you love someone and you care about that person then you should be able to do whatever the hell you want.

I really dont know how to make one...im gonna need A BUNCH of help...and i definatley told u amy that we are going naked under our togas, but im rethinking that.   So i have been talkin to a certain person lately and i feel bad for this person...this person is very insucure and people are mean to this person. so i try to make this person feel better but i really dont know what to say sometimes...just thought i would share.   Jeremy u are being a butt and i dont like it. dont get all pissy but (and im not the only one that thinks this but im not gonna saywho) you always talk about urself and ur problems but u never wanna hear about anyone elses...we help you but you arent very responsive to us.

      Jeremy! Figure out a way to invite Jill to blog with us! She tried using Kacy's invitation but it can only be used once before it expires. O Mighty Blog King, I beseech thee, there HAS to be some way to rescue her out of the depths of secluded blogging...  Today was a pretty good day, I think. I'm not really sure why. There wasn't anything really specific that happened... I thought rehearsal went alright... people suddenly seem to know how to act a little more when lights are on them. That's amusing.  I really want to go see The Passion... but I have no time! I'm supposed to see it on Friday with my youth group as part of our 30 Hour Famine, but I can't because of stupid Kate. By the way Amy, Steve Byczek and I decided I would make a great Petruchio.  I'm bored. And boring. Time for pre-calc.

      So I had another migraine attack this morning during first hour and got out of there to go to the doctor for him to relieve some of the pain (Its all from my messed up pressure points in my jaw and neck) and I'm driving home on 64 weary and tired and what comes on 102.3? FOOTLOOSE!!! ah hah hah in a sick sad way it made my day..It was just a good time of remembering moments of funness and stupidity and new happiness. I thrive on little gifts like that... and after a nap my heads a little better now..  To a *Certain Someone* you could never have a war with me, you love me too much.. besides you know i'd win....  10 days till I turn 18!!! but even better, only TWO DAYS till we all kick it with togas!!! ( for those who can come.. sorry erin.. hah hah I know you were just DYING to wear one :) ) What is all this reluctantness on going glam in a toga? Im glad some of you have come to your senses.....:)  Hope Kate is going well for everyone involved... from the stressful moments ive read of, it sounds like you're nearing opening weekend... Isnt it how a show always is?? hah... Yeah this was a better woods week, like I feel much better... about act 1, that is...since thats all we did this week... Now we just need to START act 2... yeah, 15 days........

      I'm sitting in publications right now. I found out you can type in the blog but you can not read what you guys posted. So I'm wondering how I can possibly get in. I really don't want to go to history. I'm dreading it so much and wish Kristine would ditch with me. I'm so hungry and so happy that I don't have rehersal with Yomi today. Otherwise I think I would have to kill myself. The farther away that boy is from me the better. I'm almost craving that malt that I plan on having at Al's tomorrow. Which Kristine, you are going. No questions. I have decided I will wear a toga to Kacy's party but what doyou wear under a toga? That's my question. OK I got to go class is almost over.

      You aren't kidding, Jeremy! Laugh it up?? There's not much laughing going on here! But that's ok! I love all of you!  Pam! I think I know who it is!! I REALLY DO! And I think he's wonderful. I have a pretend crush on him.. because he's so great that I just love him, not like him. You know?   Um so I have been having lots of smug days lately! It's sad! But only part of the day and not TOO bad. There are degrees of smugness, I have realized.  I lost my train of thought. That's what talking to 4 people while trying to post does to you.  You guys are all making me sad! Things are going to change SO much after this year. I have thought about that recently too.. it seems like after the Pops concert everyone started to get all nostalgic, even Patrick said something about it. Jill and I always said we were going to fail this year, to be super seniors next year.. but alas, I don't know if that is going to happen. This morning, as I walked into the commons from Siberia, I was thinking about my years in high school. It was weird when I looked up and saw this kid I knew in my computer class sophomore year, when he was a freshman. He was oh so annoying and gross, but now he's enormous (72 feet taller than me) with a girlfriend and seemingly more mature. What happened? It's so strange! And, with my stupid schooling arrangement last year, it sometimes feels like there's dead space in my memories of high school. I didn't realize how much I missed of everything being homeschooled for a year. No wonder a lot of homeschooled kids have a hard time adjusting to social standards in public schools. Sarah Bauer calls my schooling last year the "lost year." And it really is! Anyway, so I love all of you and I'm sad that people's friends typically change drastically once they go off to college. But hopefully we'll always be in touch a little.. oh here I go. Tearing up. I still have a few months! Don't get ahead of yourself! No day but today!

      OMG, I seroiusly have had enough Yomi. I have had all I can take. I'm not even joking. I LOATHE him. So much. I never thought I could dislike so much but I do. And I know Erin you don't like when I talk about people but I think I am allowed this time. He is going to ruin the second act. RUIN!!! Ahhhhh. Why would they cast him? My god what were they thinking. I had a really good night though tonight. Jeremy and Pam ate dinner with my family and then we had a American Idol party. Good times. I loved it, it was a break from thinking of how much I can not stand Yomi. But anyways on a lighter note, hopefully tomorrow will go better and I don't have to freak out and end up in one of my pissy moods(ok, so I may not be in a god mood ever but I was today, until Yomi walked in and then Leo showed up) so lets just hope everything goes smoothly and we have no worrries. You knwo they say that in canada? No worries? It's like a favorite saying. Learned that today, oh Canada. The land where you can leave your doors open and live in peace with the syrup. Ok I must be off I have history homework to be attending to. I love you all and Kacy, I'm not wearing a toga.

      We need a new title cuz it takes away from the seriousness of what people post... Anyway I am SUCH a liar- and I feel I need to come clean. I actually am not healed. Well, not completely- I think we are both healing- you know who I am talking about if you are my friend. OMG! That was so mean! Anyway... we had an interesting conversation that led to a type of closure... but really more of a new type of relationship that I look forward to. I would be in denial to ignore the feelings I have and just move on, and I know the same goes for him, so we are gonna be friends. He is right in saying that the most of what we miss is our friendship. We can still be friends and love eachother. I love Kacy but its not like we're gonna get married... Unless we are both single at 45, but thats another story. So I feel better.  On a different note- Amy made me realize that people are going to leave me again this year. I blame them for not failing in school. Seriously. And to all those that failed to fail a year ago- I miss you. Jamie, Jamie, Morgan, Michelle, Krystal, and the rest of you guys... girls?....  Happy Channukkah.

      I must say that I have never really thought about what it will be like next year until tonight at dinner. Me Pam and Kristine went to Panera bread and I realized that my life is going to change drastically. Kristine will not be there. That sadens me in more words then I can descirbe. Also, Erin my new friend for this year will not be there either, she keeps me grounded and always lets me sing in her car to whatever thrift store cd she has, lol, and that makes me upset. And now without Pat I will be the only bitter one in drama and I will have no one to back me up on why we are like the way we are. And no obnoxious Jill to be there and crack jokes just at the right moment. No Tina or Julie. It's going to be so diffrent. I really don't want it to be and theres going to be a ridiculous amount of people I don't care for that will take their places. And that makes me sad. I am going to try and live up these next two weeks because I know I won't get to hang out with you all after school. I lvoe everyone of the senior leaving and of course Pam and Jeremy. So I love everyone. Sorry to make this all sappy and weird, I'm not usaully like this. But I had to put it. Oh and your all invited to Al's on Thursday, okay? Love you all. Kacy~Can't wait till Friday!!!

      Aw Kristine you made my night! I'm so excited for you. What a weekend! Doug from Trading Spaces made my day on Saturday! But everyone already knows about it and I probably need to get over it. Ah well.  I'm the biggest procrastinator EVER! But, no, that's not true. At least I've worked on scholarship stuff so far tonight! And it's only 11:39! The night is young! I can still write an essay and do 10 journals and my precalc! No sweat! I'm gonna cry.

      so this morning, sunday, i went to church with elisabeth. and i was a little scared because i was afraid that i'm not as devout a christian as she and everyone there woulud be. but like good christians they were all very very nice to me, still, i felt a bit uneasy. and as we sang i thought that i would go to willow creek with my parents next week instead because i would feel more comfortable in not such an intimate setting- there were only about thirty people there i think. but then we took communion, and everyone lined up for bread and wine and then went back to their seats to pray and take it together. and seriously it was so amazing i had to hold myself back from crying. and then the minister said that anyone who had not accepted jesus into their hearts should pray and know he would accept you and elisabeth looked at me and asked if i had, and all i could say was that i thought so because i was so scared that someone was going to say no, you're lying, you think you have but you haven't. but all she said was, do you want to? and we went out into the hallway and prayed together, and she said she didn't know how to do it exactly but she just did. she did for me. i love her so much. i love jesus so much. i cannot even put into words how good it felt to pray out there with her. you know how sometimes you're just so happy that your heart feels like its going to explode out of your chest, like your body is just not big enough to hold all that love in? i hope so, i hope everyone has, does, and will continue to feel like that. because its awesome. and you know what? my day just kept getting better too. at the sermon portion of the ceremony an englishman went up and talked about speaking with God, the Holy Spirit, and speaking in tongues. and i listened and before i listened to elisabeth and a man standing behind us praying in tongues, and i wanted to too. and her minister at the end asked if anyone had not been baptized in the Holy Spirit that wanted to and i raised my hand and went up there. and then the minister asked me if i had been baptized at all and i told him yes, when i was a baby. so then he told me how he did that too and how he talked with a christian pastor(he was brought up methodist- i don't really know the differences guys) who asked him if as a baby he repented anything,~no~ did you accept jesus into your heart as a baby?~no~ then all you did was get wet. he explained it as just a tradition parents do. which i think is so cool and i don't want to do that for my kids then until they understand i think. so then the englishman, whom i cannot remember his name, which is quite sad that i only remember my and elisabeth's names, well he and elisabeth prayed with me and i asked for the Holy Spirit. that was amazing too, i was sooo happy afterwards i really cried, i couldn't help it, it was just sooo moving. and although i didn't speak in tongues, elisabeth and i agreed to have a bible study hour twice a week and i know that i'm getting closer to God and Jesus and i feel so happy. i've been a lot happier since i've started accepting him into my life and today my jaw hurt i was smiling so much. life is awesome everyone. i am truly blessed.

      I feel pretty good today for once. I got to get coffee with Kristine which makes me happy all the time. I find I never run out of things to say with her. I felt bad for Pammy today she was not feelign so good and U hope she feels better soon. I feel better about Kiss Me Kate becuase we worked on it today and fixed and added so much and now the only thing plauging my mind is how bad the scene with Yomi is going to be. I found out today that Erin Mcormick has nothing better to do but talk smack about me which pisses me off but then I realize why should I care? I don't like her anymore so why should I be bothered by what the hell she thinks. My throat hurts again and I'm getting close to cutting it out. I'm not even joking. I also realized today that being single is not that bad. I was talking to Kristine and my mom and realized that I'm happy and content at the moment and I'm fine the way I am but being invloved again with someone would add to my happiness factor. Oh well. I'm going to go watch High Society with my dead husband FRank Sinatra. I love you all. Oh and Johnny Depp won!! WHOOOOO

      I have been really happy lately. I have had all the support I needed these last few weeks because my friends are fantabulous. I really think I am healed, and looking forward to future relationships but enjoying the extra time I have with those closest to me. I love life and am sooo excited for a new beginning.  And I am made of Jello.

      WHAT AN AWESOME MORNING!! after jumping out of bed at the time when i was supposed to be at my church, and then running late to work, my day has turned to the best as I sit here and ponder... (im at work again... doesnt SOMEONE want flowers???)  This morning was the first week of my being a lead in our church's worship band, for the first time ever ive been apart of it, and, selfishly it was just the best.. Im not sure if its right for leading to cause this, but it was one of the most influential worship times i've had, like with that real connection... and thing is, it was sooo not like a performance, i was just being a "leader" as one of our guitarists would say, leading the whole church in worship... My problem is I totally move when im up there, I bounce on my feet, and cant help but smile super (you heard me SUPER)...sorry if im boring you all... But be happy for me :) It was definetly a "thank you God" moment.. he's given me this gift (if you can call it that) and now Im using it in a way thats glorifying to him, what he's told us to do... Anyways Im in the best mood ever so yeah! Blaaaaaahhhhh- i really need to get off and to learn my lines... AND find good, unknown booknotes on a book that will make it seem as if i have read it... GOOD TIMES!!!

      I'm realizing things about myself that need to be changed. It's very interesting... and quite adventurous. At my small group (no, it's NOT a therapy group) we talked about things we need to change in our lives. I really didn't have anything then... but God's got a silly sense of humor and immediately began pointing things out... ha. Ha. Speaking of God, I must go to bed so I can NOT fall asleep at church tomorrow. I love all of you, sorry I didn't go to Jimmy's.   Ah yes! I give props to Pam and Jeremy because I would be freaking star-struck if I didn't know them (your duet was SWELL, that's with all capitals), Amy because she also did a freaking SWELL job (you distracted my page-turning, but I still am the best at it), and Kacy because she came and endured the longest concert in the history of everything (she's a trooper).  That is all.

      Ok, this is new. Just got back from dinner with everyone. Realized I can't stand Brian Hock two nights in a row. He drove me insane I barely talked at dinner. I am so tired  but yet I'm still online. I really have a ton of homework tomorrow that needs to be done. I totally don't want to do it. I want it to be spring so bad, your right Kaci. I am so sick of socks and sweaters and I am defintaly rethinking the whole living in chicago thing. I'm really worried about the act and wonder if Im ever going to get into college. I have a lot plaguing my mind at the moment. I need like a week off from everything. Sorry to make this sound boring and pointless but this is all I really have to say. Good night~Amy

      So Im really lost in the trees, in this show called into the woods.. the morale is terrible I mean TERRIBLE ...sadly  I think it's turned into a metaphor of my life....   So Wesleyan doesnt want me.... Im really afraid that this is just the beginning of upsets.. I was affected by it, but yet also not.. My mom was like ready to break down, she kept asking me if I was really okay, and when I said yes mom! she would say I just dont see how i could be... Im working on the problem of fearing rejection, and i realize that I cant dwell upon a loss, or hold back because of it... That will only cause more upset and grieving over what never could be...With this sport of mine Im gonna have a lot of it if I pursue it... Actually, Im really okay about it at the moment.... I think... remind me not to write these at night.. I tend to dig deeper and type out more than I'd want to....Im not sure its a good thing :)  "I wish...."  Maybe I just wont go to college... And I'll move to Austria and move in with some nice old Austrian couple who eat schitzel (sp?)and Haribus (the gummies) all the time....wait do they have toga parties in Austria??? it just may not work out then...  To all apart of this blog and others... Thanks for both reading these long shpeels of babbling and listening to it as well... I couldnt imagine my world if I hadnt met you all... Thanks for being my friends (oh how cheesy!) I love you!!!

      So that person I thought I had a crush on, well I was wrong. I don't like her like that- it's just a huge amount of respect...  P.S. Wish/pray/hope for my brother, Jim. He is in the army and was just declared to be on "deployment" status. That means he can be sent to Iraq at any time.

      I feel really torn and guilty right now. I dont know what to do...  I have this person who I believe looked up to me as a person and respected me. I got strange vibes and told this person I would rather not be friends. Now he is hurt and thinks negatively of me. I don't know what to say to explain that I just dont feel comfortable... without sounding selfish and cruel. I am really sorry if I hurt him in any way...

      ...as in cool, not the musical. Geez, you are such musical nerds. That's funny because it COULD mean you are crazy about musicals, or just musically talented geeks. Heh heh.  Jeremy, we have to best blog ever. It looks so good I could cry. Really, just weep.  Kacy, you've changed. You're thriving, there's something about the wood... not only do I mean that but also its because you LOVE Into the Woods SO MUCH!  Ummmm help me! I have the worst case of senioritis!! I don't do any homework unless it is due the next day. So.. basically, I will suck as a college student. My english teacher gives us gi-normous assignments but then months to do them... and naturally I haven't started them and could just cry! Maybe I can blame Kiss Me Kate. I don't have time for anything but rehearsal and then all my youth group stuff and then sleep! Speaking of which, I better go do that so I can check that off my list...  Oh yeah, and I lost all the applications for Student Aid for Grove City College... so I spent my evening searching for it. I hope it turns up, otherwise I am way irresponsible.  Do you two want to go see Godspell (Ryan Brown is in it, and would REALLY appreciate it if we went) on Sunday? It's at like 2 or 3 and I think only asks for donations... think about it and call me if you are interested! I'm probably going either way.

      I gave up my old blog because it sucked butt. I am starting a new one to represent a new part of myself. Leaving the past behind me, I can start fresh. I hope to be a more caring and daring person from now on.  Oh yes and this blog will hopefully have more than just me as a member (assuming they accept the invitations) so that should be exciting.

      I haven't posted on here in a week..basically because I have been only posting in hiphopdancer86.blogspot.com (my blog)...but I wanna comment on...the weather, yes the weather. So the background of my desktop displays the local weather in a pretty picture like format. Today it displays a few clouds, a sun and some hot air balloons. Spring break for us Jacobians was last week and the weather was not this nice that I remember. We got jipped! Yesterday I picked up my Prom dress, oh yea! I am oh so excited even though my best friend isn't going as of now, plus she doesn't approve of my date. Thats a story in itself and it's posted all over my blog. Crazy stuff. But I don't know who to sit by or where I can sit by at the tables, so if anybody has room for me and my date, lemme know! I have to work tonight, so everyone should come visit me! Just kidding, it wouldn't be tons o fun. TJMaxx is not fun at all. I need a new job.  I heard today about Jeremy and Kacy and Les Mis! Congrats to you both. I cannot wait to see it, you guys are really amazing! Also congrats to all of those who tried out for Clue and got call backs...I heard a lot of people tried out...you guys are all my favorites! :)

      A new chapter is beginning... Im sure of it....In the "optimisticness" of Sondheim, something's comin'.. A large amount of the sadness Or "darkness" (more like a confusion) in my life is controlled by me, and Im just not going to allow it anymore...Happiness, laughter, whatever word you'de find in a thesthuarus (sp?) under happy, will reign.. and today was the grand opening of this new thinking. Today was a great day... I got to put on my dress (prom) and got the train all bustled ( I LOVE my train! :) ) And I got a call from the Les Mis People!! YAY!! not only do i get to play a dream role, I also get to spend time, at practiice and (FINALLY) on stage with my best friend.. more yays! Im so proud of us! Im so proud of everyone who auditioned for Clue! You guys are all awesome shining stars! Im so proud of all of us really... TOTALLY ripping off Amy, I do wish to clear the air just a bit... To everyone here, and I believe everyone who reads this blog who I know, you all know the words to "For Good"... I feel that way about you all... for friendships presently existant and not, (and this isnt aimed at anyone in particular) I can only say thanks for all the times we've had and will continue to have... You've made me who i am... Just felt like it needed to be said... Those were some good times... Good times... And heres to tons more!!!  Happiness is morning and evening, daytime and nighttime too.. yeah its cheesy, but its cute, you know it is... yeah... go charlie, go...

      First i would like to say Congrats to Pease and Kacy! WOOHOO!! you two will be awesome!! But i have a bone to pick with the both of u...I WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL NEWS FROM EITHER ONE OF YOU. it saddens me it really does...i think i might cry...1...2...3...ok im over it! :) The second topic of my blog would have to be....hmmp...well lets see, um what did i do today...hehe. Well i went to school and sleep through physics (UHHHH I HATE THAT CLASS!!!) Then we had gym second hour..uhh gym sucks but it wasnt that bad today...flex block was fun I LOVE YOU TINA, CLAIRE, LAUREN and CHRISANN (sorry if i spelled that) GUITAR GOES BY SOOO SLOW AND PEOPLE ARE ANNOYING! today these two kids almost got into a fight it went a little like this....Don't touch my stuff man...I'm sick of you touching my stuff...back off man...back off...on and on and on...they were both two scared to do anything...but it was amusing...my pick fell down my shirt today in guitar. i lost it...i dunno where it went. it seriously vanished. But yea..I SLAMMED MY POOR LITTLE FINGER IN MY LOCKER. :( it hurt all through english. auditions sucked...for me. Everyone did really well!everyone but me...i was really surprised that they many boys came...and a lot of them were good.

      So I really have nothing to post but I'm bored out of mind at the moment. I just wanted to bring something that not really bothers me, but disturbs me. Why is it when you walk down the sophomore hall way, half of them look like they belong in California? What is with the fake tanning and dyed and streaked hair, along with the stomachs hanging out the shirts? I just don't get it. It kind of makes no sense. It is 40 degrees outside but hey, lets wear flip flops and no clothes. It seems like were rushing the season a tad. But I mean, I wear flip flops too but some of these people look like there on vacation. I just don't get it and it has been plauging my mind so I decided to bring it up. Sorry if some thought it took up blog space but I had to vent....ok done. Also I have been thinking alot about the ACT. It really scares me alot. I am terrified. I told myself I would study over break and I definatly did not do that. I am such a procrastinator(sp) its not even funny. Oh well, I could always move to New York and pass out programs at a broadway show and watch it for free. Then I could become all Phantom of the opera like, join the choir and somehow be changed from choir girl to lead by confusing the directors with my phantom like voice. Ok, I'm done.

      hey guys. sorry i don't post. ever. but it seems like it doesn't matter because you all keep up the blog nicely :)  wow patrick. that stuff is... scary. i'm not even sure what to say. i want to call you but i can probably stake money on the fact that you are already sleeping. that's ok... and don't worry about it. things are under control... if not by the school then especially by God. psalm 27:14, yo.    my mind is fried. i have nothing to say. other than the fact that my new favorite movie is "the importance of being earnest" though i have yet to see the end. i just love collin firth.

      Hey people!! Referring to: Pam, Kristine, Jeremy, Richie, Pat, and Tina, I need your rent money. It turns out it was $70 becuase of the extra charges. I need the money as soon as possible becuase I dented $500 on my mom's credit card. I don't get to see you all on a regular basis so get it to me when you can. Jeremy I dig the colors. Not to bad. They suit the blog well. We should have pictures on the blog. I think it would look cool. Alright love ya all.

      Hey guys! I really wanted to post today, but I'm way too tired out still and kinda sick from my vacation (I went to Europe over Spring Break) so I'm just saying hullo tonight to let you know I'm still around and I'll post tomorrow w/ vacation details and my take on that "rebirth" somebody mentioned. BTW I'm actually pretty freaked out tonight; no joke. Mrs. Robinson, our Principal, called my mom. Apparently a boy at our school created a "hit list" on his blog stating, "...their sins and wrongs may wash off in their showers but they stay scarred on my wrist...our dreams are not far away. One day they'll all see, they will all pay. They will suffer, as I have suffered. I want to stab/kill\murder/show:" and then he listed off over 140 names of Jacobs students and faculty. My name was on the list, smack dab in the middle. Hock's name was on there...twice. This boy (who for now will remain nameless though with Jacobs' top notch rumor mill I'm sure you'll all find out who it is sooner or later (if you don't know already) anyway) he needs help and prayer because he obviously has issues and I hope he finds help and eventually happiness. I feel so sad for him; though currently I feel pretty scared for my own safety and health. I can only wait and hope and try to make each day better, "No Day But Today". Good luck at auditions for all those trying out tomorrow. Sorry its been so long since my last post, better post tomorrow, I promise. Have a good night everybody.

      Well I was gonna say "Tada!"about the new atmosphere but someone got to it first, anyways, I'll say it anyway.. Maybe This will help us with that "rebirth" some were speaking of... hope the return to school was nothing but the best... for all those hating school (hah, hah, amy in particular), try to find something there to find happiness or joy in, or else the rest of this year and (let's face it, sorry :) )next year will all be bitterness and.. um, unhappiness, I guess.. if that makes any sense...but on a happier, lighter note, we have new colors, and they rock.. this... blog..... 2 more months, guys, 2 more.....

      OK, first day back after break. I think, well first day back, no homework right? Umm no sadly mistaken. The amount of work I have is unbelievable. I can not believe it. I really thought I could take a nap after school, maybe go to lifetime. Um no. I will be doing school work. I seroiusly I hate it. I envy you Kacy having spring break this week. Also, I just got a job. So being the stupid girl I am, kind fo forgot about the spring play. I will be juggling school, play and work. But I think if others can do it, why can't I? I've doen two plays at the same time. Why not add one more thing? I hope I can get through this. Only 52 days left of school and I'm out fo here. And then I will be a senior and will be closer to going away from this small hellish town. Oh how I long for summer.

      So ive been kind of content lately, like today, besides the rain, was a wonderful, uplifting day.. but at the same time, Overall, im not.. I definetly dont live in a dark cloud of sadness, but I feel like a piece of me of missing... I still cant figure out what made it dissapear so quickly, but its gone, and I wish I only knew how to get it back.. its beginning to sadden me lots everytime i think of it, which is happening more and more...Things change, yes, but things do not have to become the way they have because of it.. Its a lesson Im trying to learn myself as well..... and thats basically it.   By the way i LOVE eva cassidy. Is there any way to change the color of this blog? the whole blue and red thing, hurts my eyes :).

      So just to clear the air,it seems the blog has gone dead. And I think we all know why. Lets think of spring break as sort of a rebirth. We are all new people and ready for new things. I would like for a certian few to please rejoin the blog and to not feel that some are a threat or that we do not want them on. I wish things could be the way they were at the beginning of the year and that everyone could getalong. Could we all try to do that again? It would mean so much, I think to everyone if we all just could agree and continue on with our measly teenage lives. On a sad note a very treasured place where I like to go for a drink of coffee or a nice pastrie, Kava Kava, is closing. It makes me sad considering they make one of the best chai tea lattes in the area. I will be sad to see it go. If you have never had the pleasure of going there I suggest  you do it now. It will not be around much longer, plus, Fridays are open mike nights.

Then Brian, Mike Bolz, Mike Hanley (sp? hmm) and Adam Clark (who is really funny and i didnt know he was...he is my new favorite.) came over to watch clue...long movie...not that good. The mikes and adam brought a cake for brian cuz it was his birthday...oh how thoughtful. And then me beth, sutton and brian were gonna play clue but MY MOM called and i had to go home...UHHHH...we had just started the game and i was sad :( but yea overall it was a fun night...ohhhh i smoked a cigar...well brian said i didnt really...i put it in my mouth...it tasted gross...so yea maybe i really didnt do anything. but yea...i think im gonna go to bed. GOODNIGHT EVERYONE! no one ever makes comments on my blogs...im thinking they are not worthy...hehehe..i dont care (im crying inside) byebye

      So here I am.. after like my third attempt (truly) at sleeping..oh my these late hours... I mean SOME of us (meaning me :)) have school tomorrow.. but just tomorrow!! The sun'll come out.. Im sure of it.. Annie says so.. So i thought getting up and writing some of this out would help me..... maybe.. its worth a try... sorry if this gets long.... ANYWAYS so I know I cant sleep because as soon as I lay down Ive never felt so ADD in my entire life.. Ive tried three different CD's/songs, ive tried no music, tv, no tv, etc and in whatever I have on i just think of so many different things.. Ive had problems sleeping before, but normally its because I have like issues or problems in my head to think about... right now I just strictly have so much in my head, nothing stressful of any nature, believe it or not, though some of it has to do with college, with the greatest place of all, the OC to be exact.. no I dont mean the Tv show with all the hot guys and skinny girls but OTTERBEIN!!! as of, well today I think I have almost fully decided that is where I will be attending college (AH!).. I thought oc would be an all or nothing choice, but of course, with God's design, what really ever is? I thought it would be musical theatre or no attendance, but instead I have the chance of going there for musical performance.. along with some more money in a talent scholarship... so ive wrestled with the idea for the past few days.. If I dont do musical theatre is this me being a true failure? Is this where God wants me, will this give me more oppurtunities, I mean Im thinking especially at otterbein this will happen..... So that hasnt been tonights dilemma... Ive really got my heart set on it now... i feel like I already have for a while, as some of you MIGHT have guessed :) So now Ive been laying in bed, and just realizing things, and thinking of how things will follow through when Im away...i also realized that I realize things kinda late.. that Im kinda slow.. like I was just laying there thinking wooow... In a little more than 2 months i'll have graduated! Then I was picturing things in my head, thinking of College, imagining my room being unlived in while im gone, i can see my mom walk past it, and like bursting out in to tears or something.. I'll miss some of my siblings growing up times, i mean theyre still pretty young. its hard being the oldest....and of course I will miss my people who live around me here, who grace me with their presence so often I know i take our time for granted, and I mean that... Then I was thinking of college and how it'll be a whole new world (for lack of better words),  and how it will be when the two worlds collide, ah Its just a whole new chapter that Im looking forward to see where it will go for me and what my plan is to hold... sorry this was a big ramble guys.... I guess Im just figuring this all out right as it arrives, of course, not beforehand... But what would be fun about that? without suprises, it would be like a christmas with no presents...... To everyone I hope your breaking has been wonderful and relaxing!! Seniors, I hope your decisons are coming to an end, Erin I hope Georgia was the light at the end of the tunnel and you have found your place! To everyone (again) I love you all!!!

      I am beginning to get back in touch with another person who I thought I would never be friends with again. I went to work again Sat and we were both working at the service desk...we caught up on old times and yesturday and a slow and boring day we just sat there and talked for 5 hrs. It was so nice. We talked about guys and school...I am glad that we are working out our friendship that was lost for stupid and silly reasons really.  Amy I love you so much! Your last post was so great. You are my favorite andw e definatly need to hang out over break...Jeremy and Pam...you too! I miss ya guys so much!   If you asked me two days ago about Prom, I woulda punched ya. And now, two days later I have a light pink dress with embroidery and a lace tie in the back to pick up on Sunday. A guy who I have not spoken to since homecoming called me on Tuesday night to catch up. I met him at a church camp two years ago and we got in a fight around homecoming but it seems that we have done 180 degree flips...I have done a lot since l last spoke with him where he has toned it down and is back on his feet. I am so proud for him! Alas...  Spring break is flying by..I am so sad...but then we are on the home stretch for the year! yay! 2 MORE MONTHS!

      I played dance dance revolution last night. And whipped Pease's ass. But thats not the point. It was hard. it made me mad that I could not do it right away. I thought, how s Lisa better then me when it is her first time doing this? ?It was a challenge. And I know this may not make sense to some, but it made me realize all sorts of things we go through in life. They may be small or large but ethier way we all have problems. Yesterday mine was a stupid game of dance dnace revolution in which I had to master the technique of dancing on a pad and looking at the confusing tv screen. If you would of asked me two days ago what my biggest challenge ways I would of said hoping not to mess up the one act(which by the way we kicked amjor ass on). Right now our own Kacy is going through college decisons and it's a challenge to decide becuase it basically will determine the rest of your life. Pam had a hard weekend but she is so much more relaxed and better off, Jeremy went through difficulties with realtionships and now he is happier then ever. So the point I guess I am trying to make is, how proud I am of all of us and how much teenagers actually go thorugh and the credit we do not recieve. We face problems everyday and overcome them the best we can. We sometimes do them on our own or have the comfort of friends to help us along the way. So although I am not making college decsions or entering a new realtionship, dance dance revolution is still a challenge, just not one to make a big deal out of.

      Pease your voice was missed. The concert was not the same without you. I could not hear your amazing voice and lets just say the tenors were..well..off. The choir certianly needed you. Pamela and I had fun. Our little Kristine got asked to prom. I was so happy for her and she can not seem to stop smiling. It makes me happy to see her so happy. I am running on caffeine at the moment. I'm very burned out. You know that feeling where you can not seem to keep your eyelids open at all and you just keep thinking about your warm bed? Well thats exactly what I am going through now. How I wish the bell would ring and I could go home. But we have reheresal till like 7 and then were making shirts to wear to the event tomorrow. If any of you can, please come and support Jacobs tomorrow at the one act festival. It would be greatly appreciated and we need all the audience members we can get to make us feel more comfterable. We are performing at 2:40 at Fremd High school. So please try and be there and then that night, we are all going out to dinner. Love you all.

      So I came across a website revolving around the vice president's gay daughter and the whole gay marriage debate. I almost cried when I saw some of the letters people wrote to the site. Here is one of them:   Dear Mary,  I don't understand how gay marriages are even considered possible. Yeah sure maybe they are in "love" but it seems so wrong because a woman can't get a woman pregnant and a man can't get a man pregnant so what is the point? Not that I don't think that a person should be judged by their sexual preference but it just doesn't make sense to me.  Shana Minneapolis, MN   and here's one that made me cringe:   Dear Mary,  If I love my pet, can I marry my pet? I want to marry my dog! Please Mary, I need your help to talk to your father and President Bush to legalize my marriage with my dog! PLEASE!!!!  Amy Maine   What is going on? Ahh

      Change seems to be the topic of conversation with you people. So I think I will try something new. Although you all are probably going to stop reading this about now becuase I really have nothing to say that might intrest anyone but Pam, Kristine and Jeremy. So anyways, had a rough day today. The play is not going good for me. I really do not know why. It's like I can't get into it and it's kind of hard when they stick you behind a door and won't let you move for twenty minutes. So I have been having trouble with my lines and just not having the greatest of times. I was in a very bad mood today second hour till I got home. I don't know why ethier. I basically hated anyone that came into contact with me except Pam. I don't mean to sound harsh but I had this desire not to talk to anyone. I am so relieved spring break is coming up becuase I definalty need a break from everything going on. I would love to qualify for state though. That would be such an honor and I would feel like all of our time and energy really paid off. I can only wish and hope for the best. So sorry if anyone took offense to my bad mood. Don't mind it, it happens often but atleast I'm not like Leo. what a drama queen. Come on now. Notes to a select few: Pam-Love you dearly. Thanks for putting up with my moods. And I'm glad your happy. It makes me glad to know things are better. Kristine-Sorry about my lines. They will improve and none forgoten tomorrow. I love you as well and how about beans and books after practice on Friday? Jeremy-We will do Als. Don't worry. We will fit it in. come to Chicago with me, Krisitne, Pam, Michelle and Elizabeth ok? Were going Wednesday. Kacy-Don't stress darling. Everything will work out and you will realize you worried about nothing.

      So I go to get the mail today on my way up the drive way and there is a 3x5 envelope from Otterbein... Im thinking oh no its the sorry you have talent but we dont want you card, ya know, "thanks for trying"... anyways, then I open it after a big deep breath and i see "congrulations on your acc..".. then I think oh my what does this mean? does this say acceptance??? (you know how you can think so many things in your head in like a second) so i pull it out and it says congratulations on your acchievements... Its some breakfast banquet since i have the presidents scholarship award... oh well....  perhaps one day more.. man, my stomach cant take this drama.... :)  Ugh well I have to go off and plan a period of improv for theatre 3 becuase my teacher is gonna be gone and I get to play Ms. Willey the teacher.... bah

      I want everyone to know that Erin...yes, Lydia Erin Allums...she was driving me and my fellow gang posse to the never-everland of Siberia when a seagull came along. She almost hit the poor little buggah! I was gonna cry..I saw Hermit's...(I named him) life flash by. Oh dear, the pain he woulda had. haha..Erin I love you, and I know that you were cautious about his feelings, refraining from hitting him. You were just lucky..or should I say, Hermit was just lucky! hehe.  I did it! I tried a marshmellow from the Lucky Charms cereal...I don't know what is so..pondering a word..great? about them. Compacted suga, yum!?  Another Prom dress catalog came in today. I cringed and then I teared...no, not really, but the thought sounds dramatic! My mom told me that we should go dress shopping over break...ummm for what? I don't think she realizes that I am 1. Dateless...and 2. eh, dateless.... so that goes to 3. not going to need a dress for Prom.  My 3/4 bday is coming up on Sunday! yahoo!

      Normally on a day like today, I would be more than happy to stay home from school. But I have the worst pain ever in my throat and it doesn't go away... I'd rather be in school. I am a little scared cuz the doctor thinks it's strep and I am not supposed to go to school tomorrow either... I might have to miss the concert. Eh that's ok. Oh and I can't eat because it hurts too much to swallow.   OK Pam lets not attack our own blogging members- they have feelings too ;-) . Pat I lost your email again so if you give it to me I can add a link to it if you want. Would anyone object to having their pictures on the internet? I want to make a photo album and I have some pics from Kate- let me know.   I love you all and I miss you tons!  ~Jeremy

      Its been brought up a lot lately, and its on my mind like 24/7... Its that C-word :change, and its completely constant (oo, more c words....)...My brain, or actually more a mixture of my mind and my heart, feel like they are being stretched to the point of popping....Im not emotionally troubled, or feeling like im gonna fall apart or anything, like im happy and content with each short term moment, but there are just so many ideas each with so many alternate endings running through my head.... Otterbein sends out their letters TOMORROW.... This morning in coll algebra my stomach starting knotting up like never before and it kind of hasnt gone away.... I have no appetite (except for the taste for a taco...????) and my mind just races when Im not kept busy.. people were right, having the show did take the college stuff, all those, ya know, life choices, off the front of my brain...Anyways, im completely realistic and realize i probably wont be wanted at OC, but finding out kind of writes down the rest of the beginning of my story after highschool... at least i think.... or at least limits the choices..  Ive never been one to not over achieve, but lately ive been thinking that not getting in will allow the number of decision making dilemmas to go waaaay down.. So we'll see.. There is a plan out there that been predestined, and I just want a glimpse of it... CAN I PLEASE JUST SEE "A GLIMMER?" This waiting is craziness though.. You seniors, you know what i mean... for you juniors, just wait, especially if you're planning on doing anything in performing, which i know many of you are... I just CANT believe this day has finally come.... Ive been waiting for this for 6 months, since I was first accepted into the school...Ive wanted to be in performing, "an actress" since i was five, when everyother girl wanted to be a figure skater, a singer, and dancer, or all three, with the occasional doctor or teacher thrown in.... My longing for it just never went away, never. Now the day has come with the chance of an oppurtunity of it and we'll just have to see what happens.... Im sorry if Im rambling, but I ramble often anyways, and now I just have all these new anal thoughts coming out of everywhere Back to change, Ive talked about this a lot this week, and this is what ive compiled.. It IS inevitable, which isnt neccasarily negative.... Environments, situations, people all change all the time... Its human habit, it makes you who you are, and the drive for it means you cant just settle for mediocre (uh oh 4 syllables!!) sameness, and thats good. Ive always said I hate change... But its really the action taken because of change and the RESULTS of it that i dread.. But I, we, have the ability and choice to take action and take events, feelings, and relationships down the path we want them.. It may be hard but it's always within our reach. Like Jill wonderfully said we all are handed 24 golden hours everyday… Everythings been put in our lives for a reason… Some things will fade away, but some things will shine as bright as before, and get brighter. New things will arrive, yes, but the best things will not be forgotten or replaced.  Well Im off to go to write to Kuehl essays on Hamlet.. I’ll be done in a few days…..Aw, my head is in no condition to spit out brilliant essays on Hammie...  Sorry guys, bet this post has been a real laughing matter... :)

      Patrick, why do you assume I would marry Jekyll? Or perhaps you know another "Lydia E." But you know, girls often think they can change guys in a relationship... not like I would know very much... I hope Julie brings my gym uniform to school tomorrow. I swear I have ADD.  Patrick! Dashingly using the word "disheveled," you persuaded me to tidy up my own room. I realized, too, how many pairs of shoes I have. Don't anyone ever let me complain about needing shoes. Some kids in Haiti don't even HAVE shoes, and walk all around that crazy little island on rocky, pot-hole infested streets, if you can call them streets...  I was just thinking about Haiti because my friend got home from the Dominican Republic on Saturday. (They're island twins, for the sake of clarification, though I doubt anyone REALLY cares :) ) One will never appreciate things such as running water (that doesn't shut off in the middle of a shower..) or freaking paved roads or electricity not from a generator until one goes somewhere where the people DO live like that... and really DO seem more content with life than many people here.   I say all this to actually say... well, I really don't have a moral. And this post contains no other concluding statement except that I'd like to go back sometime soon.  By the way, where did Kristine disappear to?

      Due to Patrick's last title, I decided to post my feelings on such a word....change makes me so freakin nervous...this past weekend actually I was telling my friends about things like Goldfish...I never had the cheesy treats because I am afraid of change...weird huh? Are they really so delicious? Fake cheese crackers that in the more recent months became more colorful kinda scares me. Lucky Charms...never had them...afraid of eating marshmellows that are stale feelin'. Am I just one crazy kid? Change makes my so nervous. Alas..?! (haha Erin)  "Every morning you are handed 24 golden hours. They are one of the few things in the world that you get for free. If you had all the money i nthe world, you couldn't buy and extra hour. What will you do with this priceless treasure? Remember. You must use it, as it is only given once. Once wasted, you cannot get it back."  "I do whatever the rice krispies tell me to do..." um....Jay what does that mean? please lemme know.  So just to let all ya'll know, my 17 3/4 bday is on Sunday, March 21st...so I might have a rave...a jam...a fiesta....wouldn't that be fun? Would anyone come? All invited..I will post details later! So I am an idiot huh...

      Jekyll and Hyde was phenomenal and I'm so glad I went. Thanks to Amy, Kristine and especially Pam for organizing the event. Sorry I didn't get my money in right away. Also thanks to Julie for giving up her ticket to me, and to Erin for making sure I actually received it. Seeing Jekyll and Hyde tonight reminded me of a story I once heard. “Long ago in a faraway kingdom...” No wait, that's another story, never mind, anyway... In this story, I compares life's inconveniences to life's problems. I believe far too often I confuse the two. For instance, Friday I went out and bought two new hats just because I couldn't find any hats I liked in my messy room. I kept telling Erin and Lisa how big of a problem it was that I didn't have a hat, that is I couldn't find my hat in my disheveled hovel of a room. In reality I didn't have a problem, just a minor disappointment. Everyday for weeks I “needed” to relax so I put off organizing my room. In the long run, that relaxation doubled my stress because I ended up spending money. If I had cleaned my room little by little, I never would have lost my hats and I never would have had to drag Erin and Lisa all around the mall looking for them. What Dr. Jekyll had was a real problem. First of all, who's going to marry a guy named Jekyll? Honestly, would you want to be Mrs. Lydia E. Jekyll? I know I wouldn't. Jekyll's real problem of course is that he's a raving psychopath who can't control himself (Or that his fiance' will "have twouble thaying her vowth" ).  That's a true burden; my problems are little more than setbacks, and I'd best not forget it, how peculiar! (BTW: Erin and Lisa TY soooo much for coming w/ me. If you guys hadn't have been there I might have bought that trucker hat at AE. )    On a lighter and much happier note I found out when I got home on Saturday that a letter had arrived from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. I opened the letter and saw, “Congratulations!” printed on the first line under, “Dear Patrick,” and I started chirping for cheer- a phrase I invented to replace the cliché “jumping for joy.” [I really hope it catches on,] Miami is one of a couple schools I'm really interested in and it gave me a great feeling. My ecstatic mood reminded me of “This Is the Moment”. “...This is the day! See it Sparkle and Shine! When all I've lived for, becomes mine!...”  Amy- I'm sorry you're having such a stress-out over such a silly mess; don't pout. You're life is too good to want to try to re-arrange. Just like they say in  Jekyll and Hyde: The Only Thing Constant Is Change. I hope when Spring Break comes you get a chance for much needed relaxation. You have many good friends, so as you move forward have confidence instead of hesitation. “Facini: You have a great gift for rhyme. Fezik: Yes, some of the time. Princess Bride? Anyone? Inconceivable!”  PS Erin, if you really want I will buy you a “convertable” for a wedding present, but wouldn't you rather have a convertible? Just Kidding

       So yet again I am in publications pondering what to do because my partner is gone and he is the only one that knows what he wants on the spread. Becuase basically it is his. Pam~I hope this is your final decsion. I do not want you to possibly regret something or be upset all over again. We will go boy hunting over spring break, don't worry. So last night I talked to my ex. He just randomly talked to me out of nowhere. I hate it when he does that becuase it re-opens wounds that were once closed. I found myself remebering everything we did together and all our inside jokes and it made me sad but happy. I'm glad we are still able to talk but in a way I wish we would'nt. I don't want him to say something and I will instantly fall back in to my old routine of wanting him back. I was so confused last night. I am a very confused person I decided. I do not desreve to be with anybody. You want to know why? Becuase all I do is hurt people. I've done it so many times I can't even tell you how many times I've done it. Why do I make everything so complicated and why does it have such a profound effect on me? I am going to have such a hard time when I grow up. If I'm having a hard time now, it's going to be even worse when I'm older. If anyone would like to offer some words of wisdom I would greatly appreciate it. Jeremy~I think that you are a great person and should follow your heart. If you want to get back with Keo, I support your decsion. I want you two to be happy. If you both want to be together, by all means we will all support it. Just keep in mind we all warned you that you might get hurt again. Or this time Richie. Just do what makes you happy and what you think is right. All I want is you to find hapiness.

      Wanna hear something funny? I definitely just saw Beans and Books today for the first time EVER; I had never heard of it until today on the way to church with my sister. I didn't know it was open either. I can't wait to go, especially having read darling Amy's raving reviews.   Sorry I missed the family reunion, Daughter and Hubby. I was too busy being an old woman. I found some wrinkles today too. Time for a midlife crisis. Patrick, you have to buy me a convertable. Preferably one that has heat that isn't actually air conditioning in a stealthy disguise. Funny how you and I are married yet counting down the 6,100 some odd days until our wedding... how does that work? Back to the future? Hm. I was talking about flying cars with my mother today, speaking of the future. She said she and her friends used to think, way back in the day, that cars would fly. And then she said there should probably be a weight limit per car.. and then we decided that was probably politically incorrect. This was on the way to Woodfield. (That had to be the most interesting sentence ever. Nobel prize, please.) I showed her a dress I found at Marshall Fields.. and we bought it. I really like it, but it's more of a safety if I can't find another one.   Ah yes!!! Jekyll and Hyde! LOVED IT! Absolutely amazing! AJ whats his face was... wow. I can't get over it. And I want my cd, dear Husband, so I can know the music even better. Golly... I'm so glad I got to go.   I called my brother today on the way home from church... just cuz I popped in a swing cd and wondered when his spring break is so we can go swing dancing again (all are invited, next time I go). We talked for about 20 minutes. It amazes me how much he's grown. He's a friend now. It's bizarre. All those years of screaming and being mean (from both sides) melted away with college. I told me about his girlfriend Jen and his slacking off in school and not to worry about college cuz I'll love it. And then he told me how he went to the girls' dorm to see what Jen was up to and found his friend Beth (my Grove City kindred spirit: met her once and almost immediately started to sing Les Mis with her) blasting Wicked at the security desk! HA! I sent that to her because I KNEW she'd love it. That's another story, nevermind, anyway...  I think I'll go upstairs now because it's colder than an ice cube down here. Next time I'll be a little more creative. Is it strange to anyone else that it's 10 on a school night and NOW my sister decides to practice her cello? I swear, that girl is crazy. She once, long ago, told me she needed gel pens because she thought she was dyslexic. Ah the joys of being 12, and not ahereing to societal standards of making sense. Yes, one reason I just love 'er.

      So I went to beans and books today with Kristine, I know I am going to get in trouble for saying this, but, I liked it better then starbucks. It was amazing. It is so warm and cozy and the drinks are so good. I was in heaven. We are going to go like every other day and do homework, so if anynoe wants to come cram with us feel free. It's so amazing and you feel like your in a Meg Ryan movie. We did our homeowrk by a fire, drinking coffee and eating pastries. I have found my second home. No joke. And its so much closer to my house. So yea. You want to know something funny? Guess what my parentals purchased today for Beth? A softball bat. Not just any soft ball bat. A $200 softball bat. Why you ask, when the school provides them? I just got the answer of, well, it's nice if she has her own. I will never understand those people. Love them to death, don't understand them.

      So, I don't really have much to say at the moment. I'm just bored at the present time and not very tired so I guess I will just stay up and write to you wonderful people. I found a candidate for my future husband tonight. I definatly think it is a major turn on when a guy can stand in front of a full auditorium and belt out notes that are pure and so wonderful sounding to the ear. But yea, totally blown away by that boy's talents and his singing ability. So I was thinking the other day, 3 months left of junior year hell. I say screw the next three months. I seroiusly do not care. I have no desire to be in school anymore. I just want to fast forward to June and get this over with. I can not wait till I can wake up when I like, drink chocolate milk while watching my favorite day time shows, and just be lazy. What I would give to have no assignments, or lines memorized and seeing people I can not stand to be around everyday. But, I will have to deal with it. I am also applying for a job tomorrow. Which is odd of me, being as my parents told me when I entered high school to not worry about a job, becuase they will apy for everytihng, but now I do becuase they don't want to give me money anymore. So Im applying for a hostess job at Olive Garden. Atleast its not like I don't know....McDonalds? Oh well, we will see how that works. But I'm falling asleep now so off to bed I go.

      Hello everyone,  I would first like to say a little something to Pat...So yea i was a little peturbed...but it was just cuz amy was feeling bad, and i thank you for kissing my finger and missing your line..:) Just thought i should clear that up. So tonight we went to see Jekyll and Hyde, im gonna marry AJ Keller (my apologies go out to the following people: Jamie, Amy and Pat... he is mine) he was amazing and i love him. So...confusion...so early today i was determined to not like lets just say...tomatoes. It was really uncomfortable around tomatoes today...i dunno why. like i didnt want anything to do with tomatoes again. So tonight at Jekyll and Hyde i felt different, why you ask??? I DUNNO, so i really dunno what is wrong with me. Why am i stupid....hmmp...well at least i have AJ by my side. So im really worried about the one act...(of 2 act which is what it really is) cuz i suck butt and leo is dumb...and yea we have a week...oh boy...hehe famous line. my parents are evil, honestly. my younger brother can do whatever he wants...he is at his friends house sleeping over. Their arguments..."you r never at home" (neither is my brother) "you never come home after school" (neither does my brother) "your brother doesnt come home this late (HE IS 13!!!!!). So i told them the truth when they asked why im never home... CUZ I HATE IT AT HOME!!!!!!!!! they dont understand that they make my life hell...mostly my mom all she does is nag...please amy dont complain about ur parents you dont have it bad at all. well if anyone has any advice about tomatoes...please feel free to share. i better be off. goodnight....everyone seems happy except for me...i hate it.

      I can guarantee all of you that this will be an extremely long post so for anyone not up to the challenge of sifting through my puzzling prose, please accept defeat now and stop reading.  Alright, with all the slackers gone I can begin. Thank you so much Jeremy for inviting me to this page and, “Hello to everyone.” I've been reading this page faithfully- well maybe obsessively- everyday for the past 3 weeks now and maybe it won't be so very weird if I can post here as well.   Amy- I cannot tell you enough how amazing it was to work with you on stage in KMK. (Kiss Me Kate: I think we should make it into an acronym from now on. Perhaps it will start a trend ands everyone will start to abbreviate everything. It would really add great efficiency to all our conversations.) You and so many others in that show [Pam, Erin, Jill, Kristine and ...OMG... definitely Jeremy] have been blessed with a gift for acting, singing and leading others. You really brought a great dynamic to the show and I thank you for all your hard work, even if I didn't aways give 100%, or at times even 77.896%. In regards to the whole “Drama Department Drama” (abbreviated DDD or even D^3 [D to the 3rd]) I think it would clear the air (ELPHABA: And just to clear the air, I ask forgiveness, for the things I've done you blame me for. GLINDA (Or the Artist formerly known as Galinda): But then, I guess we know, there's blame to share. BOTH: And none of it seems to matter anymore...) if I just re-posted my note here for closure:  “When Jeremy gave me your note, and I saw that the very first line started with “I'm sorry” I knew you had made your decision and I knew that decision did not include me as your date. After I read the note, I folded it up and put it back into my pocket with a smile on my face. “Why are you smiling?” Jeremy asked me. His confusion was understandable. The girl who told me she was going to Prom with me had decided to go with my best friend instead. “Well” I said “I have two very clear and very different choices: I can choose to mope and sulk or I can choose to be happy because I am able to give my friends Amy and Brian a wonderful gift for Prom; I get to allow them both to have a wonderful time by taking one another. I am so happy for them, and I say to them Congratulations! I immediately chose to be happy for Amy and Brian, not sorry for myself. What do I have to be sorry for? Amy and Brian are both my friends and I still see them and hang out with them. This isn't the end of the road for us, its merely a pothole made to make us stumble. But we're not going to. Amy, I wish Jeremy was by you, because if he were he could give you a really big "C'mon!" for me. Goodness gracious girl, why would I be mad at you? I fully support your decision. You need to do what you feel is right, and I hope I don't appear as the type of critical and unforgiving person who would judge you without regard to your feelings. Was I sad because we weren't going to go to Prom together? Yes, I was sad that I wouldn't get the chance to dance with a very good friend of mine. However, I was never mad. On the contrary, I was happy. I was happy for my friend Amy, who gets to have the Prom of her dreams. Amy is such a great girl and such a great friend, she deserves to have the best Prom possible, even if it isn't with me. So, Amy, are you on my “sh*t list”? Of course not! First of all I don't even have a “sh*t” list and second of all, you and Brian are both my friends and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time together and I wouldn't want anything less for either of you. Amy and Brian are two extraordinary people. I wish them the best and I hold no grudges. Amy it sounds like you are having a hard time dealing with all of this stress. What kind of a friend would I be if I wasn't there for you? What kind of a man would I be if I didn't treat you with all the love and respect you deserve? If you would rather be at the Prom with someone else, who am I to stop you? I don't mean that in an apathetic way because Amy, I could never be mad at you. All I have ever wanted was your happiness and I'm glad you found it after all. Thank you for all your hard work in the play. I hope we can still be friends. I really hope so. I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you. Its me who should apologize, not you sweetie. Please accept my humblest apologies, my thanks and my best regards.”  Thank you for allowing me to do that. “Even flowers have their dangers, And though scary is exciting, Nice is different than good. Now I know, don't be scared. Granny is right, just be prepared.”  Kacy- Into The Woods was great and you did an amazing job. You and Nick had a good dynamic and you even had Amy and I singing along during It Takes Two (much to Jeremy's dismay). I'm very happy I got to see it.  Pam- I hope the 1 Act goes well for you guys, sorry I won't get to see it I'll be in Munchen (German for Munich). BTW, I heard you were a little peeved at me from that whole thing with the conversation Brian did or didn't have with Yomi that time. I hope you're not still sore about that. It'd make me unhappy if I couldn't throw grapes at you anymore, or miss telling Yomi to “Be Quiet Dammit!” because I was kissing your booboo to make it feel better.  Kristine- Awesome job during the play! I realize all this encouragement comes a little belated but I wasn't in the right frame of mind these past couple of weeks to give it out until now. Like Amy said in her speech, we couldn't have made it through the show without you and I will also be sad when you leave next year. Alas, just think that we may have already had the last of our “Train Talks” during make-up time. How Bittersweet.  To My Daughter and My Wife- Jill and Erin, you guys are swell! Jill, we should get together and watch spice world sometime. Erin, sorry I never answer my phone on the first try, BLAST! I'm shaking my fist at myself. Erin if you hadn't gone to do Tae Bo the other day, you could have joined the family reunion between Me, Mitch and Jill; we played BALL, not just “ball” but BALL which was a blast until Jill and Elyssa started to hog it. Oh well, you guys are great no matter what. And just think Erin, only  6,132 days until we get married!  Jeremy- I guess it was good that we stole that booth at Bennigans because they refused to sit us or give us CrunchLunch, otherwise we wouldn't be such good friends. I'd have a Chicken Club Salad with you anyday, just as long as you don't leave me alone with James and Mrs. Espel again. Thanks for the invite to the blog, besides this we donj't always get to chat, what with General Ledford keeping us SILENT during gym announcements. Great Job in the play you too and by the way, I was being sincere because I know with me you have a hard time telling, just kidding.  Isn't it nice to know a lot? And a little bit...not.

      So I was laying in bed this morning after I'd woken up and I just kinda laid there and thought about all this weekend was made of... and i was just there and I thought oh my gosh kacy.. this is your last show in highschool... Eight of eight... That's a big deal for me.. I mean this is all I have done since i was FIVE.. except for the times of softball and gymnastics during elementary school which, obviously, I mean OBVIOUSLY failed at some point... These shows throughout highschool at Central and outside the burlington bubble, apart of (GASP!) FVYTC have been defining and memorable milestones in my life.. Ive met the most amazing people, created strong long lasting relationships, and even learned about myself and my goals and capabilities.... And of course then there is mr nesseth.. ah hah... Although he at times can make me feel "why am i trying" he can also be a great mentor and source of inspiration... Throughout this show, the verbal encouragement hasnt been tremendous, but last night he gave me a great compliment.. he told me that the show last night was all about me and that it was the best performance I had ever done... so thats nice... its definetly encouraging.. above all, he has given me, throughout the past four years, oppurtunities in all of these shows to do so much and broaden myself on the stage... its been a great ride. So i was asked a few times after the shows "you're doing this in college right??" Which brings me to..... This next week is the week of college decision making... I'll find from OC sometime this week, which is what I have been waiting for since November, and Im off to visit ISU (very excited to go!!!!) and do my audition this sat, which is where I will probably end up going... So it'll be a week of suprises.. Hope your weekends are all amazingly full of fun  Oh and I so just got the whole meaning of this show on like, Tues.. we were in english all talking and I had like an epiphany, I mean I should have had the alleluia sounds and all, and I was like I GET IT! The first act is the fairy tale ending, and the second is like reality!!! Everyone was like, yeah..... And with that I have finally fallen into the show, I feel apart of it, I dont have to think or worry about things (except for forgetting my baby backstage) and I actually LOVE being apart of this show... and being out there, with the audience, its one of the best feelings in the world, and adding in little quirks every night makes it more fun and enjoyable for me... what can i say, but into the woods, each time you go theres more to learn of what you know...... This is true, this is true..... :) The End

      I have been contemplating my current monetary plight. I have $16 in my checking account.... and I'm going to college soon. I think I need to rearrange my priorities. I have no self control with money. And I always manage to justify my spending habits. I think I have to take a break from a lot of things and work my butt off. But tomorrow my friend is in town and we are going dress shopping. Actually, she is, I'm tagging along. I don't believe I'll find a dress for $16... and even if I did, I'd probably bounce the check. I'll land in prison for... bad money managing... before I'm 20.  BUT I'm excited about Jekyll and Hyde. And if it weren't for some really wonderful people then I would not be able to go. I will return the favor.   Tae Bo kicked my butt today in gym. I'm a freakin old woman. I'll have to change that. We should have a Tae Bo party. Jeremy, you and I are going to be masters at it.   So I'm thoroughly not entertaining. Sorry for those of you that read this the whole way through, you must have been stranded on a deserted island with nothing else to do but read my post. I'm honored.

      Woods was very good. I'm very proud of you miss Kacy. And congratulations for your amamzing accomplishments. I can't wait to see Katia tonight. I'm so excited, remeber, anyone that wants to go dinner at my house at 6 and we will be off to St. Charles at 6:45. Also, thanks everyone that came ot the fashion show. I loved having my "fan"section. It made me feel good and proud to say those are my friends. I love that dress, but we have to part, for Bob and Sue won't pay for it. Oh well. I can not wait to see Jejyll and Hyde. I"m so excited and hope it's good. I hate it when high schools do shows and they kind of how do I say......ruin it for me. So I hope the guy that plays Hyde and Jekyll are worthy of watching. I"m worried about the one act. I do not think it is going very well and am nervous to show it to people. I'm afriad they will laugh at us and make fun of Pam's and mine attempt at a Italian accent. But me and Pam are tryin and well, hopefully it deveops over night. All right I actually have to do work today so I will see you all later. Have a good weekend!!!

      I agree with a good friend (Pat) who says change is good. I think it helps people realize themselves, and eachother, more. Experience many things and don't for heaven's sake dwell on the past, even if it was good. Focus on creating a better life for yourself and realize that life is short and when something fails, accept it and move on.  I apologize for the resounding use of cliches but they can sometimes be effective, sort of.  Last night was the scariest night ever- no joke. But that's OK. Woods! Can't wait.

      So I'm happy that things with Pat and I worked out and that were ok for now. I'm glad that although we were both (he mostly) hurt by my desicion we are still going to remain friends. Also I wanted to throw something out there. How many times are you suppose to forgive someone and take that person back. So yes, I am referring this to Jeremy and Richie. I love you both and care for you both deeply but you two should nto eb together. You had your time and I don't think it would work again. Why possibly hurt eachother and risk any future you could possibly have together? I personally think you two are very different people looking for different things and do not have much in common besides the fact that you both care about eachother. And for those of you who read this and did not understand my blog posting last night, it was not about Jeremy and Richie. Don't comment unless you know what the hell I'm talking about. Thats all I have to say at the moment, besides for the fact that I'm bored out of my mind and have a lot of crap to do today and don' t know when I'm going to get it done. Oh and Pease, Pat wants to be a part of our blog. So invite him please. Oh, so my sweater is making me sneeze like no other. I don't understand what is wrong and I'm like breaking out in tiny hives. Oh geez. Alright people I am off and on to do the history homework that I avoided doing last night which means I ignore my spread on boys cross country, make me gag. Oh well, you can't do and get everything out of life. I am off.

      So I know most of you know and you all probably hate me, espically Pat. And I know he reads this but I need to explain. For those of you who don't know I like both Pat and Brian. But my feelings for Brian have been with me longer and I orginally wanted him to ask me to prom. I like Pat alot and have much in common with him but I can not ignore my feelings and it's not fair for me to ignore them. I have done that before, and myself, and the other party got hurt. I just could not do something I did not agree with and I know Pat probably hates me and never wants to speak to me again as well as anyone who knew about this, but I didn't want to hurt him later on. Maybe my mind will completely change but I don't think it will. I just felt that I could not go with someone who had stronger feelings for me then I  did for them. Thats not fair the either of us and it's not right. Pat, I hope you still talk to me. I hope we can still hang out and that I don't end up on your shit list. I don't want you to dislike me or kick me out of your life. You told me to go with my feelings and I did. I had to do what I felt fit. Please don't let this affect what we have. I know your probably thinking to late and that you hate my guts with a passion and that I should not even have the right to speak to you, but I could not do it. This is all I have to say and I had to speak what was on my mind. Most of you know that this whole thing has been bothering me since it started. It would have affected both friendships ethier way and I would of hurt both of them. And it obviously bothers me becase I have been questioning it since it happened. I have made up my mind though, and hopefully my decision will be accepted and hopefully in a couple days or weeks, Pat will forgive me and I know he will find someone to go with and will probably have more fun with them. But that's not the point. The point is I'm sorry. I want Jeremy to know I love you a ton and thank you for talking to me about all of this. You definatly guided me and helped me out. Pam, thank you for listening to me over and over again and being honest. And Kristine, I owe you money for your phone bill. And Pat, I'm sorry.

      A really great friend once dedicated this song to me and with a lot of pain I am going to post the lyrics:  Goodbye, no use leading with our chins This is where our story ends Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day But before you walk away I sincerely want to say  I wish you bluebirds in the spring to give your heart a song to sing And then a kiss but more than this I wish you love  And in July a lemonade to cool you in some leafy glade I wish you health and more than wealth I wish you love  My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be So with my best, my very best, I set you free  I wish you shelter from the storm A cozy fire to keep you warm But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love  My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be So with my best, my very best, I set you free  I wish you shelter from the storm A cozy fire to keep you warm But most of all when snowflakes fall I wish you love  Gloria Lynne- I Wish You Love

      Actually, humiliating myself through posting evidence of my preteen ridiculousness.  I found my old journals today. I cannot believe some of the things I wrote. And I'm amazed at some of the things I kept, too. Utter humiliation.. especially if anyone ever saw them! Although, things seem to have been a lot easier then. There were only... popularity stresses then rather than college and actual FUTURE stresses that seem to matter so much now. I wrote a lot about the letters I wrote to people that day, the fact that my now good friend Matt "actually acknowledged my presence today," and all the random other things that make a 12 year old's journal entertaining to read 6 years later. I'm sure my sky was falling when my best friend at the time didn't invite me to go see a movie with her and my other friend; and i was all elation when my then crush emailed me. I'm starting to think I was a loser! Oh no!  I'm glad you guys like me! Or at least put up the appearance enough to pacify me! :) Anyway, I was thoroughly entertained and thought I would share it.   Ooh by the way, Lisa B. and I went to the mall last night after our book study, and I found the most gorgeous dress ever. Wish I had money. And a date. Sucky prom.  Jill- you need to start posting. Jeremy-I feel like I didn't see you today. Pam and Amy- You're freakin' hilarious. Really :) Kristine- Did I tell you, you are a fabulous hostess and thank you so much for the party on Sat? Kacy-I'm gonna see Woods on Thursday! Let me know what time! I hope your tech week is going well!   Love you all!

      I'm tired and confused and want to go crawl in my bed and never come out. I'm sick of high school drama. I'm sick of people doing things behind my back. I'm sick of everything being a competiton. I want to rewind my life to the start of the school year. I want a week to myself away from everyone and everything. I can't stand it anymore and I seroiusly think I am going crazy. I have so many questions and am so confused and wish people would answer them all for me. I want to go somewhere by myself and jsut stay there until I'm ready to come out. I want it to be summer. Screw the next three months. I don't want to be here anymore. I have no desire to come to this hell hole and sit here and try and pretend and wear a mask, hiding my feelings and thoughts about people. I don't know what to do. I'm so confused and I have a problem with making big deals out of nothing. I'm sorry to dump this on you guys but I need some kind of support and some kind of help to just make up my damn mind and to tell me what to do. I have to go though, class is almost over. Happy Birthday Kacy, Jeremy I am glad you quit work and Pam, you are one of the greatest freinds a girl could ask for.

      I don't think you people realized how horribly horrible I thought the show was going to be two weeks ago. It ended up REALLY good, and I give all of you credit. I am proud of us, guys. Two pats on the back. What makes plays the best is greeting the people afterwards. I was so pleasantly surprised to see so many people I know. Especially the "seniors", as they will always be referred to by me. Tipps, Thrash, Gasm, Hindley, Buhrke, and Farelly all came to see us and I love them all. Good times.  Oh and I just quit my job at the JCPenney Bedding Department. Surprised I lasted as long as I did.  It is my best friend's birthday today and she is SO hot.  W- Wonderful smile, voice, and hair. I- Intelligent sense of... humor. L- Long- lasting friendship L- Little moments that make you great. (Super) E- Entertaining conversations. Y- Y? because I love you and it's your birthday!  Happy Birthday Kacy! Man I should've been a poet.

      I am never having a cast party again. EVER. There were people I did not even know at my house till 4 in the morning. I could of killed them. And I had to wake up at 7:30 to go to the stupid act class that does not help. I just woke up about a half hour ago. I've been sleeping since twelve. I really hope the show goes good tonight. That would definatly make it, to have closing night the best show we have done. Last night went well and I am hoping I will have enough energy to even go to Kristines. Oh yea Kristine, I'm sleeping over. Also, I want to add how much I appreciate my parents. I do dislike them most of the time but I think what they did for me last night was great and my mom has been non stop on the run for me for the play. I just wanted to put that out there becuase I'm really proud that I have them for my parents. Anyways, were going to kick major ass tonight. Oh yea, and Erin McCormick can kiss my ass.

      I definitely didn't get home from Amy's last night until 4... and that's really late to me. But Amy, you are sooo freaking nice to let us invade your house for so long, sorry if it got to be too much. Tell your parents thank you, because I did not get a chance to.  I have had the best time doing the shows this weekend. I'm so blessed to know such wonderful and talented people. I know we all say it so often that it may eventually lose any meaning (though I hope it doesn't), but I LOVE YOU GUYS!  Kacy, again, I'm so excited to go see Into The Woods... you don't even know how much! Thank you for coming to our show!

      I know, I know. That's so cliched. Especially if one has been living and breathing Kiss Me Kate for 3 months. But, my darling children, tonight is the night!! "I love each and every one of you! Break a leg!"  (I soooo coulda been a better Petruchio. Just accept it, Patrick) Ha! Love and kisses to my favorite Shrew, Grape/Bianca-girl, Suitor/gambler, other Suitor (I hope you enter in Cantiamo like you did the other day, it was grand), Stage Manager (who ISN'T mean, just doing her job), my darling Baker's Wife, and everyone else I forgot who isn't in this blog. That sounded mean. But I didn't mean it mean. I don't think anyone reads this but us anyway! :)

      So I'm excited. Last nights reheresal went really well. I had no idea what happened but all of a sudden it all came together. Something happened to me that has never happened before. I didn't have to think. I know that sounds weird but the words flowed out of my mouth. Ever since we started I have been struggling and thinking but now it's totally diffrent and it makes me feel amazing. Thats why I love this. I'm someone different and it is like a adrenaline rush. I can be someone and no matter what I do or say, none of it matters once I leave the stage. I love this. I don't know now what I want to do with my life. I can't leave this now. It means too much to me. I have to major in it in college and I have to go against what my parents want. I can not minor in it. I love it to much. And Pam, don't let your mother affect you, please. You have to much talent to throw that away. Secertary my ass. So, I hope tonight goes well and better then last night. Yea, and that whole peaking thing, hah were so going to do that tonight, were going to break the damn peaking barrier.

      so yea...i hate my family. well i dont really...but im just upset. So none of them want to come see the show (well my sister and my mom are coming but they are dreading it...well my mom is) I really dont get any support from my  mom and it really makes me sad. I dont think she know how much i like doing this kind of stuff, probably because she never listens to me. i really wish i had the support i need from my family. i think i should just give up on all my dreams because its not like anyone believes in me. well im gonna go read the scarlet letter, and sulk in my unhappiness. pease, dont pity the duff. Good luck to: Sutton, Pat, Pease, Erin and Kristine, (and anyone else in the cast that doesnt read this blog...well they wont know but its ok!) I LOVE YOU GUYS!!! MWAH!! ohh ohhh and Kacy GOOD LUCK NEXT WEEK LOVE YOU!!! byebye!

      I have no energy. I am basically staying awake with the sugar intake I had during lunch. I got absolutly no sleep and I have way to much on my mind and all my energy is going towards the play. I will be so happy when it is over. I really am sick of having no energy and being tired all the time. What kind of teenager gets tired at 10 at night? I do. It's pathetic. My school work is suffering so much. I sleep when I get home and repeat the same exact routine the next day. Although I will be sad when it is over becase then I will feel like I have nothing to do but then atleast Kristine, Elizabeth, Pam and me can go back to our Wednesday Starbucks dates. Oh I want chai tea right now. Ok I have to go there is three minutes left in class. I'll post later. Oh Pam, lets not go to school Friday, OK?

      So I've discovered that Sondheim's Woods has been put in my life for a moment.. Its TOTALLY a metaphor to my life guys!! I mean, I guess to a person's life... The woods are like the paths we take in life, and there will be suprises and happiness and problems along the way.... The goal is to get through them.. part of the journey is learning HOW to get through them.. Our survival and strength afterward  and the people who surround you are your rewards...So many of the lyrics hit me now and I'm like WOW.....  So my major lost in the woods moment at the moment is College and my musical career in general.. Lately ive been pretty harsh with my self second guessing myself to have any career in music... Then God puts people in my life to open my eyes to it all...Tonight  Mr. N. told me he saw the baker's wife for the first time in a while when I sang moments, and that if I can do it likethat I'll be wonderful, and that he was gonna get weepy...At Times I wish stuff like that wouldnt happen... I wish I could just forget about the passion and drive I have for it and go to college for something ordinary... Then I could forget about the fear of not getting into programs and wondering why....But that would be the easy way.. Then I ask REALLY stupid questions like "why God have you given me this gift" and you know you have those moments where you feel God talking right to you... "To glorify and be an instrument for me..." Which leads me to... Over the summer I had thought I had felt a calling to mission work and music min somewhere at some point in my life.. Have I been taking the easy way out and trying to take my own plan of life without listening to God?? Will all musical theatre doors be shut in my face? and then will I know the answer??? To just sit and say "well I wait and see which doors He closes" isnt right... its not truly walking with Him....hmmm... so Now, Im not ditching the idea of musical theatre by ANY MEANS, but Im looking into other options, if all musical theatre decisions do fall through...  Im sorry That you all have to read through all this as I sit and think out loud... But this has turned into a huge growing experience for me, these past few weeks... And I think this all has been part of the stress and getting all this out can only help me..... Maybe I will pull out the rutter.... That last movement is the best of the bestest... I love everyone... Hope tech week is a breeze And practice tonight has gone so well.. Im feeling much better.... Still, though, when you come... dont :)

      Kace, I can completely echo everything you said. I've been crying a whole lot this weekend, over the most random stuff, but primarily over my realization of Christ's love. Speaking of the Passion (mainly my reason for sobs), that movie truly brought to life everything I have heard since who knows when. I know it's truth, and I know the story... but seeing it, coming from a visually-driven culture, really impacted me. I wondered aloud, to my father, if it was bad that I was really affected by it... if my strengthening of faith BECAUSE OF the movie is bad... sort of against the whole "believing without seeing" thing. He said, and my dad is the most intelligent, Godly man I know, that it is not a bad thing. He said that we, as teenagers, are so visual because of our culture that this movie could have an amazing impact on people... plus, "believing without seeing" relates more to those that demand a sign for God before they believe. I believed before, but seeing it just intensified it.   You know what else?? This guy was showing us pictures of stars, and explained how far away they were and how HUGE... and it made me feel so TINY! And what REALLY blew my mind was that God made it all... and me. He knows me by name. You know how incredible that is?? I get so wrapped up in my own life, and I try to reduce God to a pocket-sized forgiveness machine... but he's GOD. He's SO much bigger than I could ever imagine. Yet, at the same time, He sent His son to suffer so horribly and die so painfully.. for me? What?? The biggest part, well not biggest, but another amazing part is that at any time Jesus could have thought "Erin's not worth this." But he didn't....

      I am so overwhelmed. I got no sleep last night. None. I have way to much on my mind and it is causing me to stay awake. I am literally going in and out of sleep at the moment. I studied for history for an hour and a hlaf and still did not cover all I needed to, which led me to ignore my chemistry exam today too. Also, the play is good but so many details and things need to be taken care of. I'm glad I have Pam to help me with costumes and shes basically doing everything and I have Jeremy and Kristine to keep me sane. I thank you guys so much. I saw Ryan Brown's play yesterday. I realized how amzingly talented he is and I feel bad that I have never recgonized him before. It also made me feel good that he was so happy we came. It was like giving an expensive gift and watching the persons face light up but better. I can't even really describe it. My back is also killing me which caused me not to sleep. I have no idea what is wrong but it's been bothering me all weekend so I have to go see the doctor soon. Oh well, it's like I'm 50 years old, Pam's right I am an old woman. Well I must be off, I need to study.

      Way too often I get caught up in the details of life that I forgot how simple it can really be. Simple- and beautiful. I have to sit back and realize the magnitude of greatness I am blessed with- not with what is to come- but with what I have right now. My mom and dad are so awesome and I take them for granted every day. My friends are fantastic. Richie- you still hold a very special place in my heart. I think I am happy. I just listened to Rutter's Requiem - the final movement- and cried. It's absolutely amazing to me that one man could map out and create that amount of beauty and emotion. That's why he does what he does, and why I do what I do.  P.S. Thank you soooo much for that CD Kacy.

      Man oh man whoever invented the idea of procrastination, are they ever on my bad side.. They better hope I never find them. So this  ten page research paper, just found out today its due friday night by midnight on my teacher's front step...hah.. the not-so-funny-thing is I have no research done on "how war photographers depicted world war 2 differently than the Government propaganda"-or something to that affect... There is also the essay due monday to hand in on "why there will never again be an American revolution"- by some american-bashing french guy.. I sure sound like i shoudl be in AP, dont I? hah hah....   So while most of you are in a theatre right now, watching a show called RENT! (jealousness.. i do hope it was amazing!!!!!) or a show about the woods, or are IN a show (break a leg pat!), i sit at my computer, trying to put off the 6 college algebra assignments ive somehow "forgotten" to do... instead Im trying to melt a M&M with my candle, which isnt working so hot.. and i just burned my tongue.. never mind...  "and i think to myself, what a wonderful world..."   Oh man, last night, Mr. Cop and I had a date on randall rd..it wasnt a very good one, he wasnt really my type.. I was so numb as it happened, i dont remember much of what he said once i saw the little clip board in his hand.. ticket numero dos-in a lifetime, the first was just over a year ago... ah..the sad thing is i never really speed anymore like i used to, ESPECIALLY not on randall, cops are all over, but i was coming down the hill at 10:40, singing les mis, loudly. and lost the concentration of the speedometer... oops.. the parents (well only my mom knows and its going to stay that way) took it MUCH better than last time.. I was grounded from my car for two weeks, and they made me take the yellow bus to school... oh good times.....  SO theres no fuss and there's no more scenes- and no point to this entry but to say that i am in a really great mood, and I love you all so much and miss you all because I havent seen you all in a very long time (so it seems). but only a month to go!! (Seniors, im talking 18 days!!!!!) Have a great weekend, and a greater week!!!

      I haven't posted in awhile, so I think I am going to right....now! This little 5 day weekend really isn't as super as I thought it would be..I blew a lot a money yesterday, and today I will probably just sit arouind the house, go to dance and then probably hook up with some friends and be crazy. It's really not relaxing. One month left, and I can garentee you that summer break will be anything but relaxing. With Prom coming up next week, and then talent show the next, I have what seems everything to worry about when Prom seems questionable now and we don't have our music or our dance finished for the talent show...hmm...great! Can I just take a huge nap and wake up like June 5th? Seniors, we are almost there, and juniors, I hope you had fun Christmas Treeing the PSAE today...and yesterday I am sure you all did awesomely well on the ACT's...it wasn't too bad was it?

      I think sometimes Ive worried too much (fancy that) on this whole college/career "thing", and lost some my focus and love of.. life. And thats too bad. Little bursts of inspiration from very unlikely places was making me think of this earlier. There was the tipsy cubbie fan on the train (in a weird way), and today it was my sister. I was busy in my room with nothing important and she came in and asked if I had my prom pictures back. I said no, kind of brushed her aside, and she said oh. When I asked why, she told me she wanted a picture of me from prom to put in her desk at school because she was so proud of me and thought i looked pretty. Man, she caught me by surprise. She made my day without even knowing it. I think almost all of us come from families with sibs, so we all understand. Sometimes (sometimes it feels like most of the time), they're not easy to live with, but those times that are happy make them so much more special. It made me realize today that Im going to miss her, something i hadnt really thought of much. But it was a good time.   Hope your testing has gone just grandly, you juniors. BELIEVE ME, the hard part is over :). Get ready to work your addition skills tomorrow in the math section.  Seniors, enjoy your seniority for one more day (for this week :) ).  Is anyone not 'Into the Woods' tired yet?? A bunch of us are going this weekend to see North's (which I am COMPLETELY biased all about), and anyone is welcome to come along!  Pat, hope you've flipped your coin, or found another means to choosing your college.  Erin, hope you've found your right college place for you. where? Please share! (oh, i rhyme) Jill, NIU, right? welcome to the corn......

      ..For that is how one almost always feels about sicknesses affecting oneself and the people around someone, until it does happen.... It makes all the pettiness, small problems, and social snafoos seem so trivial.... It makes me just want to go out and hug everyone i love, everyone i know really. I just found out my preschool teacher from back when, a fellow church member, and family friend for ages, has a very advanced cancer, a kind of lymphoma, in the blood...  It hit me with major shock, just to hear my mom talking about it,and almost nothing breaks me more than seeing my mom get really upset and cry. Anyways, please, anyone who reads this, pray for her, and the doctors, and her children and husband, and all.... Thanks.

          So something happened to me today that does not happen often. I went on a field trip for Impact and went to go visit kids at Lincoln Praire and tell them why it is not cool to smoke and why you should not do drugs and such. This is my second year doing this but today it was different. It felt good to impact those kids lives. Some girl came up to me and thanked our group for coming and explaining things to her and realizing her mom's nasty habit is not something she just inherits. It was neat to see the different reactions from all the kids and learn what they had to say. It's amazing to me how smart 10 year olds are and how much they can say. It really felt rewarding and made me think of different career options for myself. It was a satisfying feeling I can not even describe. I wish there were more programs like this offered at Jacobs for us to go and talk to kids about the challenges they have to face in their growing lives. Alot of the kids werent even concerned about the saying no part it wa sjust how much homework they have in middle school and why recess is cut out of their schedule. So then it kind fo made me wonder about wether they really cared aboiut what we had ot say or if it's just because we were older. i mean my fifth grade class had dare and half of them do pot. So I just hope they take into consideration what we had to say. Sorry if I bored some of you. It's just that I had to share with others the feeling I got today that just topped off my really good junior year.

      So today...not such a great day. Yeah, i lost my spare key to my car and though I was able to get it open with a clothes hanger (lent by the kind ladies at the Town Cleaners) my key was nowhere inside my car. Thanks to Michelle and Lisa for helping me look for it! Tomorrow the AAA people will make me a new one for free! (otherwise it would have cost me over $200 ouch!!) The problem is that someone took the key out of the lock in my trunk (yeah on the outside...I left it there...what a doofas...ugh...stupid STUPID me) and now they can get into my car anytime they want. I could get the locks changed on my car, but that would cost over $400 [fo' hundred dollas] (back to you Bahdin) and for me it might as well be $1,000,000 because i have no job. Thanks to Pam for trying to help, without her I might have paid someone to open my trunk for nothing. To add to my great mood, i have 2 spanish quizzes tomorrow-only problem there is i don't habla espanol enough to get an “ah ploos” (btw thanks for the help on the pro para quiz Jill) and Mr. Glynn was so  hospitable at rehearsal, letting us down easy to how the set for the show will not accommodate the plot in any way shape or form. Not like I can complain because I was the only one not off book at rehearsal, and I'm supposed to be Mr. Tenured Drama Club Pres. On a brighter note...no I'm sorry there is no brighter spot to this horrible no good very bad day. BTW- Everyone sorry for the overuse of the ellipsis as well as antiquated Internet acronyms like BTW. Thanks to everyone for putting up with my ranting, flipping out and sarcasm as well as my latent posting. Some days I simply cannot "Laugh It Up"...

      Hi everyone! I thought I would come on here and talk just a little, liven things up... This may seem RANDOM (when am I ever not?) and Blabbish, but please feel free to read and comment nicely... Hah. So I hope everyone's week has gone wonderful, with the weather and all. For all you who went to Phantom IM JEALOUS! and I hope it was great!!  May 1st is college decision day... why do i feel a little reluctant to send in the deposit? Im sorry if I seem a little bipolar on the subject of college (and Im not trying to be funny when I say that, cuz in this case, it is true) but i guess its just scary. I wish I would have looked into the chicago schools more, even though i visited and researched and told myself they were not for me.. oh well , live for the future!:)  You know that terrible smell one has after they go tanning? And you know how much worse it is when water hits the skin? Well i went tanning and then ran around geneva to like 10 different stores yesterday, in and out of the pouring rain.. i felt sorry for any person i came in contact with... My apologies.  TWO DAYS TILL PROM!!! IM SOOO EXCITED!!! This week has gone sooo slow because of it, but only one more day! and then the fun can begin. YAY!  Aw exactly one year ago my chorale performed the Rutter Requiem and it was so beautiful and lovely.. we worked on that thing for like two months! It was a great reward, and now I miss it...you cant stop the beat ALMOST makes up for it.. sigh.....  Next week is going to be sooo nice for us seniors!! Mon i have a field trip to the zoo, and wed and thurs we have off!! that is soo nice. We should go out to lunch or something. Sorry Juniors. Have fun with those tests. Bring a pillow along to sleep... trust me... You'll all do wonderful! :)

      Yeah that's me. Except I'm consuming the Chinese food, not being it. Ummm... I'm WAY frustrated with Clue. I have no idea what I'm doing... no idea how to memorize lines... no idea where to go in the stupid "hall"... and i feel like some of the people have resigned themselves to be a part of a really bad performance, so they don't really care.... Oh yeah, and I have to swear a mink. (No offence, Lisa dear!!!) Eh.   Gotta go sing at YG... woo.   Bye guys, love you all a lot.  OH YEAH! I bought a garter today! So I'm looking forward to prom a lot; it'll be really fun because I'm with the coolest people ever!

      Ive decided Everyone can use a little change once and a while, or often... a lot. So Here are three things I will try super hard not to do again... or ya know, not so often  1) the overusage of the period (.). If you notice, i use it a lot, mostly  to tie one random idea to another.. often. Oops there i go. (You do not know how many times Ive had to retype this.) (...) 2) Adding a sprinkling of salt to my fries, especially, as ive been accused of, when these fried objecs have already been salted. Im sorry if ive offended or grossed anyone out in the previous procces of doing so. 3) Presinging as I like to call it.. Enough said.  So there you go. Wish me luck! Just kidding.

      Whew what a day!!!!! What a Week so far!!! So Yesterday I had seriously 10 choices, different paths to take for college/life.. Now I think I have actually made up my mind, and its the right one, its what suits me best.. The only thing that scares me is I thought I had the right decision before too, and that has not stayed the same at all!! But The worries cant hold you back.. you've got to "roll on the wave of surprise". I cant be afraid of changing minds and failing.. that will hold me back more.. The word "fail" has never meant anything positive in my house in any light, I mean the P's see nothing good coming out of it, if that makes any sense, when something can..The biggest different in opinion between me and my parents is just that- They believe that by me not having all the answers to my fate and being okay with it, not being comepletly stable in a career, Im not serious, when trully its the opposite.. Its time to take the ride..... Its time!!!!  Something has changed within me, something is not the same. Im through with playing by the rules..  Yes Im a stealer and its cheesy but it is THE TRUTH... I mean,  Yesterday I was timid and afraid, of this all but today Im seriously determined... Its all goin down- in a good way.. Can I deal with all the pressure? Im not sure, but Im ready to try All the things I love, all the things that are my comfort zone, its time to truly break out of it and see who i really am and who i can be... YAY!!!! ....sort of.... :)

      ...cuz it's getting harder and harder to breath.  So the whole "your a peach" is being said by everyone lately...(actually me and Erin and Sam are the only people who really say it)...but anyways yesterday at work I thought that I should finally say something to this really annoying girl. So I said "Hey Parker, your a prune"..she said thanks and continued to talk to me like it was a compliment...some people will never get a hint I guess. Anyways. To the title: A month and a half left of this place and I am no longer a Jacobonion and I am constantly freakin. College, big excitement!, No longer seeing my friends everyday, sucky like no other. There will be no FLAG!, no getting Espel real mad, no ultimate frisbee!, no lame excuses for not having homework, and most importantly every single friend that I have made at Jacobs won't be so tight in my life anymore except for my roommate. argh. But then new experiences with new friends will be replacing the experiences I had with old. As much as I say that I will never visit Jacobs during flex, every junior will know that damn right I will be there the first weekday I get to be home. On a happier note...tomorrow Madrigals goes on a fieldtrip! yay!

      Watch me spell "today" in French wrong..  Today was my "hunker down in the house and avoid human contact if possible" day. Actually, I suffered from extreme boredom after rehearsal (which really got to me.... I can't handle being yelled at with no direction. Oh well, I'm over it!).... so I fell asleep on the couch then woke up and went to my maja's room to paint my nails again... then went downstairs to the basement and worked for 2 1/2 hours. At least I get money for staring a computer screen putting in names and addresses and such. I've learned though that I could never handle an office/data entry job. I'd go nuts.  Let's talk about something happy. Um... we had the "be good for the rest of the year" chat with Mr. Bregy today, it lasted about 42 seconds. And Patrick, Lisa and I made the observation that all those that booed or were obnoxious in the assembly are most likely the ones that will get in trouble and end up having to take finals or not participating in graduation. Its sheer irony.  I'm really hungry now... and I am pretty darn sure that all this was unimportant musing that was completely unnecessary to post about. "Sucker!" to those who read it expected something fun.

      Sometimes I wake up and wish I could be someone else. Not that I don't like who I am, but that I have been forced to act in certain ways and do certain things. Like I am trapped in a lifestyle I can't escape from. There are things I would like to do that I probably won't. Or... as often as I would like...wink...Like go to Bangkok with Julie and Evan... Sex...  And get my lip pierced. I am sick of people telling me not to- because it isn't me. It's frustrating. Ahh I feel confined sometimes like I want to scream. Repressed? Possible.

      Hmm... ever get into a slump? Like... a mental-and-emotional-almost-break-down kind of a slump? I think I'm in one today. And I don't know why. I think I'm stressed about the unknown (big surprise, it's like all I post about). BUT then I look down at my nails and no one can possibly stay depressed when staring at such a cheery and sun-engulfing color. Oh yeah, and I thought rehearsal today was fun.. it seemed like we were all in funny moods. Maybe it was just my caffeine intake earlier today that contributed to my enjoyment of Clue madness. Es possible. Ah yes... and Colonel Mustard (or Colonial MusTARD) telling Mrs. White that she paid the black man...    Did I mentioned I'm TERRIFIED of the AP tests I have to take soon? HOLY TOLEDO! I'm gonna fail. On a scale of one to nine, I'm gonna get a negative 18. Just wait. I can't write worth beans. I didn't used to be that way.. back in the day I could write those timed essays with no problem, now I think I just worry about it too much and then freeze. OH well... I estimate I'll get a 3 overall, and that tests me out of freshman english for some colleges. Either way... I suppose it doesn't REALLY matter in the long run.  Tonight I had to go give Heather Garcia a disk so she could save a paper or something at Sarah's house. I  walked across the dark cold street and heard some sweet melody floating through the air. Alas! It is Sarah, sitting on the street corner strumming a little diddy on her guitar (not Butch, the new one... did we name it yet?? I don't recall!), just like old times. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I might succumb to getting a kindred tattoo... inkify myself... though probably not, as much as I enjoyed dancing on the sewer years ago. I love how none of this makes sense to anyone but Sarah.... this one's for you, kid!!   I'm finished... and I hope everyone has a grand day tomorrow!

      Have you ever been friends with someone and it makes you depressed to be friends with them? I HAVE! Have you ever thought that a "friendship" could be one sided (thats two words rite?)? Oh but it can. Yea and it sucks. I really dont think that being friends with someone is suppose to make you miserable. Sometimes i think my so called "friend" gets pleasure from seeing me upset all the time. Well im sick of being walked all over. Other people have feelings, but i dont think everyone knows that. Because not everyone takes other people feelings into consideration...i have kept in long enough. I'm not gonna let you walk all over and treat like crap anymore. I feel like this was the only way to get through to u. But it most likel wont work...its always your way. And please dont make me an excuse for you not liking someone, you do that all on ur own. I hope the person im talking about gets the clue...im sure they will.   Anyways, I hope everyone had a WONDERFUL Easter. gym tomorrow uhhh :( So overall i think i might be happier now that i dont have someone pulling me down. O kokinomalis makes me happy. (oh yea only tina knows who that is) byebye everyone

      Possibly the greatest weekend ever. Thursday I hung out with Amy (who we all love because she's a great person) and Erin. We visited Jill at her dance studio, where I learned some kick ass dance moves such as the bicycle. Then we visited the Elgin Gang (Amanda and Kacy) and chatted. Back to Lake in the 'gonquin we went and Erin went to bed. Amy and I waited for hours on end for Pat to come so he could watch Nemo. He didn't. We cried. 1...2...3... OK we're over it. (Copyright Pam)  BTW Pam I am SOOOOO happy for you about prom!  Friday night I went to a party where there was no alcohol and nothing other than good old- fashioned "hanging out" occured... ... yeah. It was really fun and Richie made my night again because he is amazing and I love him!  Yesterday I hung out with Kacy and we visited Amy at her work. She was so cute but they were busy so we bounced. We left my car at the mall and went to her house, where I got my fill of Nemo. Then we went to Hannah's and the DC kids were there and we just hung out. Pat drove me back to my car and when I got home my brother was having a small orgy (night before he was to go back to the Army) so I retreated to my room and counseled Terry on the phone, promising him that the party that was at his house on Friday while he was gone was eventless.   Sorry but I had to write 'cause I barely do any more. Feel free to comment about how much you hate me. Oh and be anonymous. That takes guts.

      wow, third quarter is finished. is anyone else aware of how long the year has been? seriously, i guess just so much has happened this school year that if the events and all of the drama were spread out evenly, i think they would fill up at least three years time without boredom. but thats good, we wouldn't want life to be boring, where would the fun be in that- but thats what boredom means- lacking fun.... sorry. but today is Easter which reminds us that there is eternal life and we can start over and that is amazing. Life is wonderful and full of excitement! everyday just gets better and better and with three new tires on my car i am ready for everything! but the most important day of my life so far is coming in the next week and i want you all to know: i am getting water baptized. i'm not sure what day, probably next sunday, but i'm duely soooo excited (for the non-christian bloggers: this is a way for me- a born again christian- to bury my old life and start anew with the Lord). i went to pam's church on thursday- greek orthodox. it was nice, different, in mostly greek, and good, but man am i clumsy! when i moved to let a girl get past me, i hit my head on the ceiling. and when everyone put their kneelers down to pray, mine got stuck. so when everyone had gotten really dead silent, i gave it one last pull and BANGED it on the floor- yeah tina called it magical, although i wouldn't say it beat my magnificent fall at all.                                  gooddaysir.

      Today is Easter for those who don't know! I just got home from church. I went hunting for eggs this morning and I got an Easter basket with the Jessica Simpson cd. It's really good, I like it! I am leaving to go to my Amma and Papa's to find another basket with money (a woohoo!) and then off to the other side of the family for more and dinner.  On Thursday, Jeremy, Erin and Amy came to visit me at my dance class...it was a delightful surprise..I was shocked, I didn't think people really cared about me, but it was because they were bored anyways, but they thought of me and visited! It was so cool! People have friends watch all the time and I felt special! Sorry I didn't hug ya guys, I was sweaty, but I love you guys so much for coming! I hope you weren't that bored lol.. Well to all, have a Happy Easter!

      Well I had an eventful last two days. Yesterday was pretty bad for me. My finals did not do to good and my damn cold is still with me. But Elizabeth made it much better at dinner. Thanks Erin and Jeremy for the Culvers. Jeremy has a chicken plant in his stomach. Nice one Jer, and no chickens do not grow on trees. I got a call back for Route 66 and that kind fo cheered me up but then brought me back down becuase I can not go to it. I have to work 3 to close and so not looking forward to that but I do get to work with richie and everything goes so much more faster when I do. I went to Als today with Brian and had a amazing malt. I love Als. Me and food just go so well together. If I could eat all day I would, like everyone else. Although, today at work, my co worker Bob says that he is never hungry anymore because he is a cook and hes around food all the time. So he has no desire to eat it. I was like you have to be kidding, maybe that should be my future profession. I would probably just end up eating more though. Oh well, come visit me tomorrow, anyone. It always makes tihngs go faster that way, and Erin if you plan on coming, buy something this time. And Kacy, make Jeremy go with you becuase thats the only way he will come and then its two people we get to see. I love you all and have a good Easter.

"We will sing with jubilation, we will shout til the mountains ring, we will lift it higher than the heavens, with jubilation we will sing!" I only think Patrick and Erin would understand middle school choir songs...fun times...Espanol 4, a woohoo! Anyways, I wanna go out to lunch afterwards at 130..I have no clue to where, but I want everyone there if ya'll are interested..we can talk tomorrow about it I guess!

      Ok so for those of you that have my screen name, it has changed to Broadwayamy126. My dad switched interent services and I will no longer be using my other one. I absolutelt hate him at the moment becuase everything had ot be changed and no more cool icon or sound and I can't see others icons or profiles or hear their sounds. I'm going to miss my aol.So I just wanted you all to be aware. I have not been online in a long while due to my deathly cold which is sucking out all of my energy, and work. Work is so tiring, I'm really afraid to grow up. I did 4 and a half hours fo homework last night to find out it is not due until tomorrow. I must say it was turing out to be a pretty bad day but then at flex Sara made it all better by gluing pennies to the gorund and I had a venti chai creme after school thanks to Kristine. So tomorrow is our last full day and I can not wait for it to be over and then we block clue! Whooo. I must be off though, come visit me at work people!!

      All I can say is that I look like I have no teeth. Very flattering, Jeremy. Thank you. :)  I'm going to be up all night doing homework. Stupid me that put off doing my binder for English until the night before. For those in AP Eng next year, don't procrastinate... though you will SOOOO want to. I guarantee senioritis will suck you in and hold on to you with its clutches of death. Right now, I have a paper that I was suppose to have a rough draft for last Tuesday (didn't do it), 2 practice AP multiple choice tests left (both an hour each), 10 journals for Othello (still don't know what I'm gonna write about), and 30 Open Questions for which I have to write... something...and.. that is all! OH YEAH! AND all of pre-calc. Suck.   But I'm not complaining! :)

      Friday night...I slept 15 freakin hours! I woulda slept probably but my cell rang and woke me up! I don't ever remember for sleeping more than 12 hrs at a time (like all summer long)...but maybe that just comes to show how much sleep I miss during the week.And even Friday after school before I hung out I took a 2.5 hr nap...Oh, how I love sleep.  Then I had to work last night and I found out my schedule...I work an extra day this week..it sucks so much. I hate work. Everyone else who works works at cool places like Barnes and Noble. And I have a sucky job with sucky pay and I am applying at all these places and I get nothing..at all! I think I might take a trip to the mall today...hmm...yes to the mall.

      So I am officially a working girl. It sounds so weird to say to people yea I have a job. I don't think the idea has really sunk in yet and I don't know exactly how long I will last. But we will have to wait and see. Totally come visit me! It's nice to see famialiar faces. I saw Into the woods tonight at Dundee Crown. AMAZING. Thats all I can say. The acting was wonderful, Lisa was great, Jackie was just unbelievable and the princes were totally hot. The set and costumes fit perfectly. It was like watching the movie. I was so impressed and so proud of them. It makes me think why can't we do it  becuase they had a all student orchestra so why can't we? They seemed fine with the music. Oh well, hopefully we will do something good and fun and just....different. Also I am happy that next week is one of those goofed up weeks. Early release and finals and no school. that makes me happy to know. Hopefully it will go fast and Sunday will come apace hahaha (Pat) and Easter basket baby!!! My favorite part. WHOOOOO. Anyways, it is late and my nyquil is kicking in, good night everyone.

      I have a question....does anybody know what that song is about? I was thinking that today when I was trying to get my mind off other things like how retarded Prom is all come up to be. It's all about the drama, and I am about to like return my dress and not go. But seriously, what is that song about? Ponder about it, and let me know. I should know considering I am in good ole spanish 4, but no. Not at all. Big time FALE-URE, right Jeremy? heh I have one of those feelings today where I just wanna stay home and sleep...but I won't let myself do that since it is FRIDAY! yahoo!  I have a solo that I am singing at St. Margaret Mary on Monday in Show/Jazz frickidy choir...and today I found out that I am singing with a tape. The bad part is is that the music is more flowy and not totally to a beat, so me and Espel can't watch each other for cut-offs, etc. So I have to fake my way through it on Monday and I am nervous about it. Oh dear. I will be okay!

      Tomorrow Jim is coming back from Arizona for 9 days. I hate him because he just took a trip to Disneyland with his girlfriend. One good thing about the military is that you end up travelling everywhere I guess. He's cool though. What's weird is that we have gotten a whole lot more comfortable talking to eachother ever since he moved out... And I kinda miss him because he was the cool one in the house. Although very loud and annoying, he made things interesting.  I was gay bashed today. Damn high schoolers.  I lose my keys EVERYWHERE I go so you all need to help me out with that if possible. ;-)  Pat- We rocked for the April Fool's trick. That was da shizzle.  Pam and Amy- Let's go to college together. (Kacy too, if Otterbein calls my name.)  Richie- You made my night tonight. I love you a lot :-).

      so keeping up with the song title theme i noticed pam introduced, that song has been stuck in my head for.... hmm.... lets say ever, that sounds nice. but i love it so it's greatness. well, i bet most of you are reading this thinking, or possibly even saying outloud by now, "who is this cat who thinks he/OR/she(because i don't know the sex until i read the entire blog to see at the end who posted it, unless i'm like this certain author who also cheats and looks ahead) can just post on our blog?! Some Nerve!" well, kids, i'm sorry. i don't deserve to be on the blog because of my intense lack of committment, but let me just say, JEREMY, that i do feel incredibly honored to belong to this prestigious blog which contains no hitlists whatsoever (what is mr. bardin talking about?! i am sooo not wordy. and that comment can go to mr. moeller, too, pshh, make your thesis a list, comon now!). well, bottom line is my name is on the blog and i'm really going to make an effort (of what degree i can't say) to live up to it. so, this is my initial post and hopefully it will be followed up by many grievances and fun, happy stories that i just want all y'all to read, and hopefully mostly the latter. let me just say how happy i am, i really can't say it enough. I LOVE LIFE!!! SOOOO MUCH!!!!! i love everyone and everything and life is wonderful! truly spectatic (someone please comment on if thats a word or not)!i truly hope you all feel the same way. good night.(hey how do you say that in spanish espanolas and espanolos?)

      So it has reached the end..today was my last day of highschool!!! all fun Nothing too bittersweet (none of that sad stuff will hit me till grad and more so when I leave IL), except a little bit of chorale which was more just fun..Carolyn (an alto-member) brought in subway for us all, so we ate and ate and ate cake and ate more, and then seniors got to pick music to just sing through, stuff we've done through the years... it was so fun.. and I mean when we are together, we are just like one big group of friends, even though we come from different circles of friends and so on...so we all skipped lunch, and stayed in 203 and talked and laughed and settled little fighting matches that have been set for four years now ( all in fun), and some even began a cake fight, but that soon ended... it was all a great time...  So our graduation song: UTTERLY cheesy and easy, but I love it, the words really say a lot, and make me smile super big, and begin to tear up everytime we sing it.. Its a good time, and just is kinda the place where I am at, how i feel towards my family, my friends... my room, my cat... The list could go on.. Its not like its the most powerful song I have in my head, but something about it hits me, hah, maybe its the whole graduating thing...so i felt the conviction to post them on this ever busy blog... It go as follows :) I love you all, so much.... Thats not a goodbye, Im just stating the obvious :) Okay, now the song begins  Letting go, When the day comes that I must say goodbye to you, Its the last thing in life I'll ever want to do. I know it has to be,  But its so hard for me. Letting go,  Facing up to the truth that it is time to part; Giving way to the day that may well break my heart. It's Not the thing I choose, To win I have to lose... Letting Go, Moving on with my life into the time to come. Day by day, page by page, sure of what Ive become. But then you always knew that's what I had to do.  For I know the only way to grow is just by letting go.. LETTING GO when the time comes I know I shall return someday,  But till then, this is when I have to find my way. Its a fact of life, though it isnt fair, There will always be this love we share Still the hardest thing is letting go

      good thinking, kristine. i definitely have been pondering the whole leaving high school thing.... but as of now i'm still going to be here, wasting away again in margaritaville... or lack- of-college-decisions-ville. whatever. i think i'll live in a refrigerator box on wacker drive. everyone wants to live in the city at some point in his or her life... so all are welcome to visit me, as long as you give me money for a happy meal.  but seriously, patrick can testify to the fact that sometimes i get in strange moods when i start to think of this thing called the past 18 years of our lives being almost over. it's like we have had everything planned out for us for so long, and now we have to jump into the unknown, ugh alas.   i have to call someone to see if they can pick me up from the library... i'm stranded.   but i love you all, and i'm sorry this blog has all but died. this is an insanely busy time for everyone... that and i can't go on my computer at home any more because our office has flooded a lot lately, so for fear of electrocution...  someone pick me up! please?

      So...... It seems that the last few months of this school year have created some different, and some REALLY different outcomes to situations that we all could have imagined. And now, people are beginning to freak out. To get through all these changes, people have got to calm down. Yes, its true relationships are seemingly changing everywhere you look, some for the better, others for the not-so-better. The thing is, thats what happens with change. I see it that it is then our job to not let change tear things apart and break down relationships. I think this time of year we all have a tendency to be more easily annoyed and frusterated, and let people leave our lives without putting up too much of a fight. Its something i think all of us have been guilty of, me included. It seems to be one of those things you learn about as you grow up, and sometimes it seems too late to try to fix, it being so late and not worth it anymore. Its true, half of us are graduating, all going in completely separate directions. Why try to improve things that will only seem tanglible for the next few months? But its those memories, those happy times that you'll want to remember forever. You wont be able to when a estranged relationship is in the way.  I feel like by being a senior, especially in these past few months, my views are sometimes put into perspective,  thinking past more than tomorrow (this happens OCCASIONALLY, hah). Believe me, i dont feel like im more knowledgable than anyone else, but I just think of the outcomes of everything now that I know Im going to be leaving. It may seem a little late, but I dont want to leave anything undone, or unsaid. I guess I just need to turn my own thoughts into actions as well. Yes, this blog seems to be dying- It used to be a place where we could come and write about both the serious and randomness in our lives. Now, its attacked (that sounds dramtic but true) and seems to be among the divided territories. Yes friendships seem to be falling apart too (i just said too!.. things are REALLY changing... hah hah thats a joke). but things dont have to stay that way. How can relationships end so quick? I dont think they can..I just hope we can all take these chances we are so gracfully given everday and try to "end" or continue things right.  And why does going off to college have to be the end of everything??? I know I need to think realistically, but people prove my hope, friends stay friends through college distances every year. Not every friendship will of course, but I think If you want it bad enough, if you put enough effort in, no matter how long you've know someone, i dont think you can lose it. yes, things may be a bit different, but you dont have to go away. i know it wont be easy!, butIf its a friendship meant to last a lifetime, a few years hopefully, in the long run,wont seem to make a huge dent.  So Im sorry this post has lasted as long as it has, Im sorry if it makes no sense, but i didnt know where to start... I just know that I dont want things to end that dont have to, or end in sad ways in which they didnt have to.  The lyrics to the calling's new song, "our Lives" kind of sums up it all up in more poetic words than i can make up. I would put them here but then the post would be like super long.. Hope you all guys have a happy week... Days left, my senior darlings.. Lets make them count. all of us.

      so its true, people are splitting. and it wasn't one thing that started it but its definitely growing- exponentially. and nobody's doing anything about it, including me. unfortunately i don't know what to do. i feel like i'm adding to it because it's too hard to choose sides. but i'm also trying to become more independent of people because i'm scared for the future. and i really won't be that far from here, but some of you will, and- well, people hardly ever stay friends after high school, especially people who have only been friends in high school- for a few years- no matter how good of friends they are. and that kind of scares me, but even as i type, i know what i say is true but not to the whole effect. because it hasn't fully hit me yet. some people are getting scared and i can only sympathize(thanks pat) but not fully empathize yet. so that makes me even more scared because how am i going to feel come august? so i propose this: can all of you bloggers write on here how you feel about this leaving and graduating business, and then i think we could say our "goodbyes" now before this really hits us that OUR LIVES ARE CHANGING forever. and hopefully that can bring this group some more vitality so jeremy's love child doesn't have to die so soon. well it'll make me feel better. how about some feedback on the idea.

      This website is dying. It doesn't make sense to have it anymore mostly because we aren't one large group of homies. We are separated and divided as if Jacobs is home to some sort of civil war. Unfortunately I have come to the conclusion that changing the colors just won't do the trick this time.

      Holy toledo! Blogger is different. I don't know if I can handle it.   So I just had the best time at Prom. I'm so glad it went well. Not that I thought otherwise, but so many people told me how much last year wasn't fun. But I had an absolute blast, and I can't wait to see everyone's pictures.   Now we are entering the TRULY final stretch of the school year. And I don't really know what to do. I am the only one in the world, or so it seems, that hasn't decided where to go to college. But, I suppose it's ok. Lately I've learned a lot about just trusting in God. Otherwise I'd have a nervous break down! But I say that now with an air of lightness because I am in just too good a mood at the moment to worry. Hopefully it will last...   Anyway, I love you all and hope everyone had a good time at their respective proms. Have a good week!

      so i'm sitting here, avoiding anything that might be productive in my life(aka homework) and i said to myself,"hey i wonder what's going down on the blog, why don't i have a looksee." and man, you guys weren't kidding about anymosity! i hope the anonymous kid left since amy's last post, oh i love her so much! it makes me sad. but yes, procrastination? i think i win triple points for not filling out my tax form yet. yes that's right, all of you disbelievers, i am an outlaw, a rebel with really no cause at all, seriously- none. i got nothin'. but kacy, you see procrastination really isn't a bad thing, as long as you have a good teacher who appreciates the fine art of it- some of you here know john personally, yes he is a conouseiur. all i need to say here tonight is that everytime i get over my girly crushes, another pops back along. i really hope someone else identifies with this, because it drives me crazy. i won't have a crush on anyone for a while and then i'll go ahead and acknowledge the fact and how proud and happy about it i am and then, BAM! it hits me. amy you know who i'm talking about. i go stir crazy inside my mind sometimes. although i found shouting it outloud(where no one can hear me of course) did help. but i am open to any tips, any tips at all ladies and gentlemen...

      Today I had probably one of my first in person realization of how some high schoolers can be, making me yet just a little bit more excited on leaving HS and going off to NIU where hopefully those people will stay back away from my life. Today I was having yet another conversation as usually with Jeremy during gym where Mister Ghetto-Skipper (as I would like to call him) decided to interrupt and proceeded to make unnessessary comments. Amuzing...no...I have no clue who he is trying to impress actually...but for real Skipper, he's so full of himself and when he opens his mouth he is even more an idiot...Jeremy...you gotsta hang with me soon because we haven't in forever, and I believe I am up for another party at NIU...who's all wit me?  Just to let ya'll know, 4 days to Prom, and still, not so excited..hmm...  And I would just like to say, Kacy and Patrick seem to scare me with their clonical (is that a word) experiences...you guys are great...oh yes and why doesn't anyone for the most part post anymore? The last 5 posts seem to be either Kacy or me...are we more entertaining than others? Let's take that one as a compliment Kacy!

      I'm back from the dead.... and I can't believe how much this blog has changed! I miss everyone; yet, surprisingly, I don't have much to add to the blog even now. Eh.  I was just shopping for a laptop, because I have been really convicted that I need one for school. At least so I can continue to not post on the coolest blog ever. :)  So, I have decided that I have no friends. Except some of you. Sometimes. :) Today I called one friend to see what she was doing, and she was busy. Then another friend got on the phone and was all friendly and stuff and was like "oh yeah, we are swimming at ____'s house." (Names left out to protect the innocent)  So I was kind of hurt, because I wasn't invited and it was like the whole gang that I usually hang out with. Hm. I think I should take it as a hint.  And now I'm just whining like a little freshman about how people don't like me. Well... too bad. Heh.  Sorry I'm crabby. I hope at least a few people on this thing still enjoy my company at least some of the time. I'm going home now because I haven't eaten since this morning. Bye kids.

      There's a fine fine line.  There's a fine, fine line between a lover and a friend; There's a fine, fine line between reality and pretend; And you never know 'til you reach the top if it was worth the uphill climb.  There's a fine, fine line between love And a waste of time.  There's a fine, fine line between a fairy tale and a lie; And there's a fine, fine line between "You're wonderful" and "Goodbye." I guess if someone doesn't love you back it isn't such a crime, But there's a fine, fine line between love And a waste of your time.  And I don't have the time to waste on you anymore. I don't think that you even know what you're looking for. For my own sanity, I've got to close the door And walk away... Oh...  There's a fine, fine line between together and APART. And there's a fine, fine line between what you wanted and what you got. You gotta go after the things you want while you're still in your prime...  There's a fine, fine line between love And a waste of time.

      Hey I say we "re-ignite" this blog... Lets get everyone involved, make it awesome again ( for I do believe we were awesome bloggers) and let "the flame grow super" and set this whole world wide web thing on "fire"..I think ive been to one too many bonfires...:)  I mean now I have listened to many wise people speak of this whole commencing commencment, and have more importantly talked about it with my closest friends... "changes, they are acomin" but this would remain a great way to retain some stability and familiarity between us all i believe..it doesnt have to be a super frequent everyday thing, for we all know time isnt something we all have extras of.. but just to know its there and to keep us all in touch.. I dont know if there is still hope, but I "hope" so :) I think so..Whats it hurt to try? It cant change for the worse...  So lets revamp and remake this thing, maybe even throw in some new colors (who knows) and start this all again.. for a great hopeful person once said "hey do you wanna come out and play the game? its never too late." If we wait much longer im afraid the moment of this all will pass and it will be too late.. oh how dramatic sounding.... I love you all.. hope everyone had a wonderful weeekend.. Mine was awesome.. I got to see and celebtrate with so many different people, and all of you again, which made my saturday.

      So I haven't posted in A LONG TIME! but not many people have so...yea...I don't feel that bad. Well this is kinda just a goodbye post...mostly to the seniors. So you are graduating tomorrow and even though there is still all summer, I don't know if I will see you guys very much. The last three years I have always had you guys around. I may not have been as close to you freshman year, but there was always someone to look up to. Now most of my friends are leaving. I don't think im ready to grow up that much. There have been so many changes this year and some may have been for the better and other for the worse. So I just wonder how next year will be if I don't have those people around that I'm used to seeing everyday. I won't be able to car dance with Kristine or paint my nails orange (or geranium) with Erin. And I will be missing a couple bandmates, oh Jill...WEASLEY IS OUR KING! Pat I don't think its weird that you eat the WHOLE apple. Kacy you always know how to make me giggle! So what I am basically saying is that I'm gonna miss all of you SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO very much. Thanks for all the memories...I love you all!!   OK so i remember this song from middle school, we were gonna sing it or we sang it for 8th grade recognition...oh Miss. Lackey  For just a little while  We were here together  For just a little while We were side by side And I know someday that we will reflect on this and see what I special time it was For just a little while  For just a little while We have shared the music  For just a little while  We haved shared a dream (i dunno if thats the line but as i sing in my head thats the first thing that i think of) And i know that in our hearts we will never be apart  what a special time is was For just a little while  Maybe Someday when we're on our own Maybe Someday when we're all alone We'll remember this time and we'll smile For just a little while.   (so there is one more verse and i dont remember how it starts... but this is how the verse ends)  And i know that through it all  these are days we will recall What a special time it was For just a little while.  So i just had that song stuck in my head...ohhh it makes me sad...

       So, I am not too quite sure if posting on laugh it it up is still legal...I haven't posted in a super long time, so I am now considering that I havent seen any of you in over a month (miserably sad and I am sure you all miss me too!)    I am off to school on Aug 19th, and to some you may be leaving even earlier and some, later...but that is my move in date. I am ever so lucky to have my fellow Jacobonians that are seniors now so close to me. (only 50min!)...but then I have my fellow college kids who will be traveling to all different places all over...So I&nbsp;have concluded that I need to see all of you before the date&nbsp;posted.    I have been pretty busy lately...making new friends, changing my look and&nbsp;battling self&nbsp;control. I know that this summer has been busy for all of ya'll and&nbsp;I would really love to hear it&nbsp;all! So for now, this is goodbye, but not for good!!! Call me! and I will&nbsp;for sure call you! Have a great day!

      and it could be SO much worse, but if i care to delve in to my negetive unhappy mode i can say les mis is getting rough, with two weeks to go. The directors are getting pickier, rightfully so, and not in an evil way, and most of the people just arent committed. Some dont even know the show... i overheard a few of the younger ones arguing about whether i was dead or a spirit or still alive, and one girl, my age, came up to me and was like," you're dead right? wait, no...." it can be amusing. the set design is really nice for a tiny stage, but once in a while, when i feel like complaining and comparing, its not the blizzard theatre with its cool technology but thats okay, because things change and thats okay. erin i saw you asked about the dates: it begins the 15th, @ 8 and the 16, 17 @8 and the 18th is at 2. the next weekend is the same.  hope everyones summers are going fantistically. Im having a good time, just not liking the idea of my full time job.. i love my job ( i work at the county building doing seasonal data that is so simplistic with a great office atmosphere) but the whole getting up at 7 and losing 8 hours of my day, but i really got setup nicely..  anyways this post is far boringer (thats not a word but thats okay)than all but i just felt like contributing a bit.   I miss seeing everyone as often as i used to. we should all get together some time and have a ho-down (sorry.. remember, i am from burlington.)

      (i'm mainly commenting on patrick's comment on my last post. my comment turned out to be so long that i decided to post it instead...) yea patrick. i second that emotion. let's get together, yeah yeah yeah, why don't you and i combine?...... parent trap, anyone? no?  i soooo can't sleep. and i have to get up to go to ikea tomorrow morning, actually THIS morning, with sarah... funny, cuz i was up at this time (2:16 am) yesterday morning too.   but seriously folks, lets hang out. most of us leave prettypretty freakin' darn soon. i'm starting to get excited, but i'm still crazy scared! i decided northwestern is stupid, because they still haven't told me who my roommate is... but i've decided too that that's how God wants it to be.  i've learned to trust a lot this summer: with my missions trip, unknown college plans until THE last minute, my job, and all that. it's very cool, actually... as sucky as it sometimes appears. the daily events in my life, that seem so dark and SCARY!!!!, are always so much brighter at the end, when i look back. i can even say that about just this summer. i don't expect anyone to feel like reading this, its just good to get some thoughts out... and typing is so much faster than journaling the old fashioned way. speaking of which... i really want letters and emails and stuff when i leave. and i will REALLY REALLY try to respond! email will be the easiest to respond to, but i just love writing and receiving snail mail. i will try to keep my  urlLink ernah22@juno.com  account, but in case i can't and i must, for some unforeseen reason, switch to the school account, i'll let everyone know....  maybe i'll try to sleep now.  i miss my casa hogar and sobre el puente kids. hope they are alright.

      that's a word my friend and i made up a long time ago...  it means i love you a lot... i think it came from my mumbling. don't really know. but that's how much i love all of you. you all make my heart smile. i just wanted to let everyone know, even though my posts are few and far between.  now i'm going to sing "... i've got my hand in redemption's side whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine i'll fit all of these monstrosities inside then i'll come alive...."  and here's my tidbit of the week, more for myself than anyone else: "count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. and let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."  bye chiquita bananas!
