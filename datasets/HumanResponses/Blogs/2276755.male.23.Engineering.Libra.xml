      Not much to post today...must complete a report for Computer Graphics course.  I do this while listening to "more songs i like", a CD compilation I made years back.  "Live and Let Die" just ended.  Can't wait for school stuff to finish so I can catch up on movies playing on the dish.  BTW, I saw an advance screening of The Last Samurai.  It was actually pretty good.  Great action, cool Japanses dudes.  It should have ended 1 scene earlier, though.  Great flick, though.

      Alrighty, Lance Bassem sent me a great link today.  You know Triumph, the insult comic dog from Conan O'Brien?  Well, here's a music video he made:  urlLink http://www.milkandcookies.com/links/10764/   It's best if you copy the link and paste it into your browser's address window.  Pretty funny.

      So I found this neat little 80s quiz.  They test you on song lyrics.  Attemp this only if you have a mastery of 80s songs.  I thought I knew stuff pretty well...I'm a little embarrassed at my score of 48.5 or something like that.    urlLink         Anyway, click on the pic to try it out.

      Oh, I forgot.  The opening of Unscrewed starts off with Martin Sargent saying "Clearly, I'm the guy.  I'm pretty much the man."  I mean, how can it not be funny?

      Emergency update:   Anyone with a passing interest in Star Wars MUST go to this site:   http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/star-wars-holiday-special.html#gallery  It shows just how hilariously awful 1978's holiday special was.  Read it, then look at the galleries at the bottom.  Guaranteed laugh-out-loud time.

      The constant hum of people mumbling at school is like some sort of torture device...but I will continue despite it all, for you, my fans.  So I discovered this pretty funny show on TechTV.  If any of you have satellite or digital cable and like electronics, I suggest you get TechTV immediately.  Anyway, this show comes on weeknights at 11:30pm and it's called "Unscrewed with Martin Sargent".  It's like a talk-show, with Martin Sargent at a desk and he has a co-host and each episode starts off with some (pre-scripted) chatter (you can tell by the quality of acting).  But it's usually pretty funny.  When it's funny, it's pretty good, but when it's not, it's sorta lame but you gotta give Martin props for trying.  After that, they have segments.  Like, they send correspondents to trade show to make fun of computer people or whatever.  They also have little skits.  Take yesterday for example.  Martin told this story about how he bought an old Russian satellite off the US government's auction site and it came complete with a Russian aerospace technician (he came in a straw-filled box).  So the co-host asks what he did with the guy.  Martin replies that he did the obvious: locked the Russian in a closet and set-up a webcam.  Then we see the webcam feed: There's this guy in a lab coat stomping around a walk-in closet kicking boxes and such.  Pretty funny...especially at 11:30pm.  If you can, check it out.  They have a web site, too,  urlLink here.   Also on TechTV, check out X-Play, a pretty good videogame show.  The din of talking in the lab grows, encompassing my entire self.  I feel like I'm swallowed by the noise...fading...fading...fa..f... ...

      This entry is brought to you by "Astro" by the White Stripes.  He're a sample: "Maybe Jasper does the astro Maybe Jasper does the astro Maybe Jasper does the astro, astro"  Special shoutout to Joe "Greasy" Greiss  Anyway, last night was the Computer Graphics assignment 3 demo.  We had to make a 3D house and walk around it and change the texture of the house and the surrounding yard and stuff.  Anyway, that's the basic idea of it (it's much more deailed than that, though).  In any case, our demo was at 8pm last night.  So all day, I studied the code, just in case she asked nutty stuff.  I even spied on other groups passing their demos.  This one guy made a hockey game, with a goalie and a player and puck and ice mechanics...SICK!  Anyway, right before the teacher demoed us, she said she didn't schedule supper so she took off for 20 minutes.  Our demo finally started aroun 8:25 and ended shortly before 9.  She didn't ask too many questions.  We did all the talking and showed all the stuff that the OpenGL programmed house can do.  Of course, Murphy's Law came into it.  When we tried to bump map the cube we had floating in the back yard of the program, it turned blue.  By restarting the program, it finally worked, but I don't think she minded too much.  Then she asked stuff like "Why did you pick this project?  Who did what?  What gave the most trouble?"  We cracked a few jokes, she cracked some and all was good.  Best of all, we get an exra 4% for going on the first day.  Score!!

      So after tonight, smooth sailing for a bit. Tonight is the Computer Graphics demo where we have to show the teacher our project.  I fear the questions she may ask!  Other than that...ESPN Hockey, anyone?  So, as has occured every year, I have an exam after LotR movie comes out.  So I gotta wait a whole day or two before I can see the final chapter of Peter Jackson's brilliant series.  I cannot wait.  You know what bothers me?  People who say "Lates" instead of "bye" or what have you.  What's wrong with bye?  Or goodbye?  Or goodday?  C'mon, peeps!!  Alright, back to analysing 3000 lines of C/OpenGL code.  Bye for now!

      Hockey Night at Dave's was a (mildly) rousing success!  Despite a low turnout (me, Dave and Mo...and later Dai), tons o' fun were had by all.  First up was the MegaStars (oldtimers) game.  All sorts of past greats took the ice.  I, along with many others, predicted the Oilers oldtimers would win, by virtue of their relative youthfulness.  Sure enough, they won 2-0.  What surprised me was the spectacular play of Bill Ranford and Grant Fuhr.  These dudes can still play!  The Oilers should sign them.  They'd do way better than their current goalies!  After that, we ordered Terry's submarines.  Anyone who knows what that means knows how impressive those subs are.  We ate and ate, before and during the actual outdoor Heritage game.  It's really neat to see the breath come out of the players' mouths.  They were freezing.  But the prize goes to Jose "tuque" Theodore for wearing that hilarious tuque with the pom-pom on top.  he had it over his helmet!  Classic.  He should wear that every game for good luck.  After the game, we played ESPN Hockey on the PS2, 4 players.  Great fun.  However, I must say that the PS2's loading time is friggin' insane!  Soooooo slow.  I own the game on the Xbox and the loading time is much noticeably shorter.  Later that night, I finally saw an episode of Samurai Jack that I had missed.  It had Jack and these Shaolin fighters beating up of rock monsters.  Really cool fight scenes.  Having already downloaded the 10 episodes of Star Wars: Clone Wars cartoon, I burned a VCD out of them.  The quality of the downloads weren't too great, but I made a VCD regardless.  With Nero, I made a cheesy little menu page with a picture and titles.  But then I went online and found somebody's pre-made VCD of the 10 eps.  I downloaded it and made the VCD and wow!  This guy's quality is top notch and his VCD menus are animated and have music.  VERY impressive.  Okay, that's it for now, homeys.  TTFN.

      Howdy yall!  Justin suggested that I do what he does on his blog, which is to state whatever music is playing at the time of this writing.  So, this entry is brought to you by "Jolene" by the White Stripes....and the letter "A" and the number 3.  Anyway, I got over my bad mood yesterday.  How?  Well, I sat down and watched all 3hours and 43 minutes of the Two Towers Extended Edition.  Well worth it!  The EE is so much better than the regular edition, which was already amazing.  A bunch of new scenes show flashbacks of Boromir and Faramir.  It goes a long way in establishing Faramir's motives.  Anyway, well excellent.  I can't wait for the Return of the King EE, cuz it's gonna kill the regular version, from what I hear (if you wanna know more, ask me personally).  Also, I then played many games of ESPN Hockey on the ol' Xbox.  I love that game, even though I suck.  Oh well.  Now, I will maybe play a game or two of ESPN Hockey, then get my hair cut, do some much needed homework, then go to Q-bert's house to watch the Heritage Classic.  Anyone who doesn't know what that is...tsk tsk.  Just kidding, but if you have a passing interest in hockey, you MUST watch.  Alright, I'm off kiddos!  See ya on the flip-flop!

      One of the worst weeks ever.  After the huge highlight that was last weekend, this week has become dreadful.  I can't seem to get enough sleep.  I'm always tired, especially at school.  I have no motivation or drive of any sort.  I know, I know, a couple of short months and I'm finished school, but I'm tapped.  You ever wake up angry at everything?  Yeah...I hate everything and everyone.  I'm looking forward to watching my Two Towers DVD soon...but I don't know when.  So many school-things to do...  By the way, Warner Bros. has dismissed the previous report of MAtrix Revolutions coming on DVD on January 6th.  We'll see about that. And I hear that FOX itself might bring back Family Guy, not the Cartoon Network.  In other news, I will download the last chapter of Star Wars Clone Wars cartoon today and burn all ten of them on a VCD to be watched in a DVD player.  Ca't wait until February for the next batch of ten... Alrighty, peep!  Time to face another day.

      Howdy, peeps.  A special shoutout to Kevin Vo, who seems to be my only regular reader thus far in the infancy of my blog.  Cool, Daddio!  Anyway, what else...?  Is anybody else excited about seeing Messier and Gretzky reunited on Saturday?  One thing, though.  The old timer Habs are so old!  The Oilers are gonna kill them.  So, it's official!  The Matrix Revolutions is on DVD on January 6th, 2004!  Due to lack of $$ at the box office, they feel the time to make $$ off the whole Matrix franchise is dwindling...so they wanna cash in while they can!  Ha!  Jerks!  I heard that the Family Guy may be resurrected due to strong DVD sales of its seasons.  Crazy...It's probably pop up on the Cartoon Network in the States, but surely someone here will pick it up, like Teletoon or something.  I received the Two Towers Extended Edition in the mail on Tuesday (thank you, amazon.ca).  I wish I had time to watch it, though.  It's 43 minutes longer than the original, and from what I hear, it's so great.  Stupid school...  Alrighty!  Bye!

      Okay okay.  I usually deride pro wrestling because it's usually so stupid.  Sure, sometimes the fights have some neat acrobatics, but the outside the ring stuff is so absurdly insulting to intelligent people that I have to gag.  This weekend's Survivor Series was no exception.  I saw the last bit with the Buried Alive match.  Ridiculous!  When Kane busted in and threw the FAKEST puches I've ever seen, I'd had enough!  He missed with almost all his punches!  And he's a pro?  And then, the shovel fell into the grave with Vince.  That so looked like a mistake.  And oh no!  I big explosion when 'Taker tried getting into the truck.  Ooohh!  How mysterious!  The crowd looked so bored.  And rightfully so.  This supposedly big match was TERRIBLY yawn-inducing.  I know that it's just an excuse for Undertaker to disappear for a while so he can get surgery, but still.  I regret having seen the few minutes I did.  I read that there were some good matches earlier in the evening, but that last fight was laughably bad.  That's it for now.

      Ok...so....The White Stripes concert was totally amazing.  We were pretty close and could see how great Jack White is.  His guitaring, especially at the beginning, is amazing.  As an amateur guitarist, I can appreciate how great he is.  The music totally rocks.  I love the let's-have-fun-rocking attitude mixed with blues.  My ears were ringing well into the next day.  MonSciFiCon 2003 was also amazing.  Pat Lee, president and amazing artist at DW comics, proves once again that he's a nice guy.  I got another sketch this year from him...and it's personalized this time.  Also, other guys like Ramos and Kubert were so polite and nice.  they talked and drew and signed their hearts out.  Kudos.  So, yes, I got a picture with Marina Sirtis.  She was cracking a few sarcastic jokes at our expense (for asking for pics just as she was gonna leave).  She speaks French, too.  What a surprise.  We also got pics with TNG and DS9's Gowron!  He was funny.  The guy who plays Chewbacca was also there and we got pics with him, too.  He's friggin' huge!!!!!!!!  OMG!  I cannot tell you how big he is.  Finally, there was ST: Voyage's Neelix.  I refused to take pics with him.  On a disappointing note, Lou Ferrigno did not show up.  What the hell else could he have been doing that was so much more important?  Balancing his checkbook?!  Anyway...  A good time was had by all.  Now, with the Grey Cup tomorrow, this weekend is solidly packed with great times.  Sometimes, life is fun.

      Well, tonight's the postponed White Stripes concert.  Back in August, Jack White got into a car crash and destroyed his finger, thus cancelling concert.  Months later, the band is finally playing their show.  Should be good.  Let's not forget about MonSciFiCon this weekend!  All your favourites will be there.  Marina Sirtis, Lou Ferrigno, Ethan Phillips, Peter Mayhew and the guy who plays Gowron.  Plus, all sorts of comic book types!  That should be so much fun, some of you may not be able to handle it.  (I don't even know if I'm being sarcastic).  Seeing as how Chris (aka MastaCSG) is boycotting this blog, I suppose I can badmouth him and he won't even realize.  It's like badmouthing the Amish...they'll never know!  So has anyone read Chris's latest article on itoop?  Man!  He's such a whiner.  He's complaining that the escalator is not a ride.  That's a stupid idea!  The escalator IS a ride!!!!  If you want to march, use the effing stairs.  The escalator is for lazy people.  You're MEANT to stay on it and not move.  Oooh, you just have to rush up the escalator, right?  Why?  To save 3 whole seconds!?!  Sometimes, when someone rudely rushes past me on an escalator, I make it a point to eventually catch up to them in the hall and walk directly in front of them just to make the point "Hey, I didn't run up the escalator and I still beat you, you jerk!".  I hate people who push past on an escalator.  The only acceptable reason for running up or down is if there's a bus-catching involved, because in such situations, a few seconds CAN make the difference.  But don't give some pansy excuse like you're late to class.  So what?  You're late!  Big deal.  Eff... I'm out.

      I have a few things to say...  I was watching Average Joe yesterday and felt my IQ drop with each passing second.  But it was great!  Wow...you should see these losers attempting to justify why they are the ones who will win.  Hilarious.  And what' the deal with the brown guy!  He's 21 and is going for his Ph.D.?  What's up?  So I read that Warner Bros. is so worried that the market for the Matrix will soon be non-existent, that they are considering releasing Revolutions on DVD before Christmas!!!! That's insane!  Very bad word of mouth is causing it to make much less money than the previous flick, and they're panicking.  What's worse, they fear nobody will buy the DVD on its own, so they plan to package it with the first 2 movies.  So anyone who wants the first would have to get the others too.  Wow...I love it!!!!  To quote Jon Stewart, as he put it very brilliantly on The Daily Show, "The Matrix bbbbbbbbllllllllloooooooooooowwwwwwwwsssssssss!!!"  He must have said that 5 or 6 times during the course of November 10th's episode.  Also, I must profess my hatred for all things school-related.  Also x2, I must profess my hatred for Lucasfilm for denying Canadians the pleasure of watching the animated Star Wars mini-series.  And boo to the CRTC for "protecting" us from the evil that is American cable channels.  Boos all around.

      So we were in the quarter finals of our soccer league and we finally got to play on a nice field.  Instead of the mud on the lower field at school, we got to play high up on the hill (behind Molson Stadium) on Forbes Field.  Forbes, like Molson, has FieldTurf, which is so cool.  It's a synthetic playing surface that is made of individual blades of fake grass.  What's more is that there is fake dirt, too, made of ground rubber.  This gives the field some bounce to simulate real grass and dirt, minus the nastiness due to bad weather. Anyway, I was in nets and did an amazing job!  The only goal I let in was an own goal off one of our players (dammit Neil!).  But in the last 30 seconds, we scored to tie it...but then the dreaded shootouts began.  I got a piece of the first kick, but it went in.  I guessed badly on the next two...but the following two, I had a good jump on them...but the guys kicked hard and accurately to the very edge of the goal.  We lost the shootouts 5-4...thus, we were eliminated.  There's always next year...no wait!  There isn't!  Good season, guys.  Addendum:  I am so sore!  I accidentally stepped on my hand with cleats (don't ask how).  And they I pulled a muscle right above my foot and I literally cannot move my right foot.  And my right quad is pulled, too...  Anyway, I have school stuff to do.  See ya!

      So, I gots homeworks to do, right?  But the big Als football game is on tv!  Dilemma!  Should I bring a tv into the computer room and watch?  I decided against it because that would detract from my work.  So what do I do instead?  Create a blog!  Wow!  What a waste of time this is!  It's more unproductive than watching the game.  Also, I have a separate window open on cbc.ca's sports scores.  They're the only ones I found who list up-to-date CFL scores.  So not only am I avoiding my homework, I'm also looking at the scores every few seconds.  Must...refresh...browser!  In other news, I must...MUST...tell everyone that I despise the Matrix.  Not the first one, mind you.  It's great, despite hints of bad writing ("You ca't die...because I love you!"...blech!).  But I didn't like the 2nd movie.  I thought it was was too flowery with the dialogue and abandoned the founding ideas of the first.  What about all the people stuck in the Matrix?  And then the 3rd movie...wow!  How awful!  The ending is waaay too unsatisfying.  The series went from trying to free everyone from the Matrix (and thus save humanity) to saving all those rave-ing lunatics (pun intended) in Zion!  I could care less about them!  I could care less about Trinity, Link and his bloody wife...Argh!  The only bright spot about the sequels is Agent Smith.  Wow...  Coming just in time for the holidays, the new book that's guaranteed to be a best-seller:  "How to Ruin a Franchise" by the Wachowski Bros. with a forward by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga.  Eff, I'm out.

Here, you will find anything I have to say about anything.  Consider yourselves lucky that I am giving such uninhibited access to my mind FOR FREE!

To kick off this happy time between semesters, I saw Return of the King, and boy was I happy.   200 glorious minutes of one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I smell Oscars...maybe even for Sean Astin, who's great!  I can't wait for the Extended DVD...it'll probably clock in at over 4 hours...  I will take this chillaxing time to get re-acquianted with video games....my preciousssss......

      So Javier Vazquez is gone.  Good riddance!  I never liked him anyway.  He always blamed everyone else for his shortcomings.  He's supposed to be this wicked amazing ace but never showed it.  Instead, he sneers at other players on the field if they don't make a play behind him.  He can't pitch in big games either. Now he's off to the Yanks, where Steinbrenner is known to publicly bash his own players for underperforming.   A guy like Javy would react with bitterness and lash out in that scenario.  I seriously can't see him staying in NY very long.  He won't be able to stand the pressure.  Either he doesn't finish the season as a starter with them or when he's a free agent at the end of the season, he leaves. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

      My name is Vrej and I have a McDonald's hockey card problem.  Must...continue...buying...cards! I love those cards.  They're so cool.  So today was the last day of school.  Now it's exam time.  gotta study, I guess...but not tonight!  Tonight, I'm going out to see Master and Commander.  Looks good, and my boy Russ is in it...always good.  I found out that Avery "Ben Sisko" Brooks has been an associate theatre professor at Rutgers University since the 70s, up till today.  Crazy!  I apparently bought the Return of the King game for the xbox on ebay today.  I placed a bid and won!  They game is supposed to rock hard!  Plus, it's 2 player co-op, which is always a cool novely nowdays.  I went to the dentist today.  For years, the guy's been saying that he'll keep an eye out for these little dots of cavities.  This yeah, same story.  He said I could maybe get a filling for it.  Or not.  As long as we keep an eye on it.  Meh, whatever.  Ok, I'm out dawgs.  Word up!  And the Froo-Froo B*tch-Dawgs rule!

      Alright, I admit it.  I'm buying McDonald's hockey cards this year.  I got one with a piece of net mesh insode the card.  How cool is that!  These cards are very well done this year.  I urge everyone to buy them (mainly so that I can trade with you).  Other than that, I gotta start studying for finals now!  Argh!  The humanity.  But there are so many more important things to do...like watch the extras on the Two Towers Extended Edition DVD.   Ahhh...I love DVDs.  Anyone else watch "Arrested Development" on Fox?  I must say that it is one of the funniest shows on tv now.  It's quickly climbing the ranks.  It's on after Malcolm in the Middle on FOX, Sundays at 9:30.  WATCH IT!  Yesterday's episode was particularly amazing.  Let's hope FOX has patience with this excellent show because they rarely show patience with others (ahem, Andy Richter).  Alrighty, I'm out.  BTW, the official soundtrack of this entry is the voice of Joe 'Greasy' Greiss asking questions about how to finish the Computer Graphics report.  Bye, y'all!

      So I downloaded something called "Johnny Cash: The Essentials" or something like that from Bit Torrent.  I hate to seem like I'm following trends but it's excellent.  I know that it's suddenly cool to listen to the Man in Black but to hell with people's opinions!  I likes it.  I made a new compilation mp3 CD with the 3 disc Johnny Cash download, all 4 White Stripes albums, the 2 Strokes albums, Sam Roberts and The Raveonettes.  I really like the Raveonettes.  They're a little odd (all their songs are in B-flat minor).  And they're from Denmark or something.  So after the Halo Trial Version has spread like wildfire through the computer labs, we finally were able to install a cracked FULL version of the game.  LAN parties at school!  Except we must all remember not to yell to loudly and always, always remember to press ALT-TAB when officials show up, so as not to get busted.  Some variation on GameDay is going on tonight chez Dave.  I called it MegaDay, but time will tell whether that moniker is apt.

      The Star Trek fanboy world is abuzz with speculation that Star Trek overlord Rick Berman and his writing crony Brannon Braga may possibly (finally) be fired from running Star Trek.  Ask the vast majority of Trek fans and they'll tell you that these two are running Trek into the ground, as evidenced by bad ratings for "Enterprise" and the tanking of the last Trek movie, "Nemesis".   At the risk of sounding like a first rate geek, I must admit the prospect of seeing these talentless hack gone is exciting.  Outside of Trek, these guys have virtually nothing to their credit.  I hope the stories are true.

      I came across this brilliant quote.  If you get it, that's great.  If not, you'll be confused.  "There are 10 kinds of people in the world: those who know binary and those who don't."   Tee hee hee...

      I found this quote on the net at several places, and I think it may be true:  -------------- "Frankenstein" - The series is expected to take place in present-day Seattle with both Dr. Frankenstein and his monster surviving the past two centuries thanks to genetic engineering on both subjects. The two are then discovered by a female cop and her partner through a routine homicide investigation. Over the course of the pilot, Frankenstein's monster joins forces with the cops and will combat Dr. Frankenstein and his other creations in successive weeks. From Martin Scorsese and author Dean Koontz.  --------------  Oh my effing GOD!!!!!  How is this garbage gonna potentially get made?  It sounds like a parody on the Simpsons or something! Why can't I get a tv show?!  I'm sure I could make a way better program than this.  Holy Jebus...   Anyway, back to work...

      It's been a while since I last posted but here I am.  I got one of those tiny USB drives.  It's 64MB (sorta small by what's out there today), but I got it for an excellent price, so I'm happy.  Thanks to Allison for hosting the Goodwill Gameday (previously called Gameday 3).  Fun was had by all involved.  More posts soon (lots of work to do)  Bye!

      In the past week I've noticed these new earmuffs that are all the rage.  Whereas normal earmuffs cover the ears and have a band that connects the two pieces, these new ones are one piece of furry material, spanning the back of the head.  I mean, if you want to go for that Lobot look, that's fine, but whatever happened to the good old tuque?  Apparently, some people took offense to my Vlad bashing.  I says he's greedy for turning down a lucrative offer to remain here, only to get a lesser contract elsewhere.  Well, it turns out he may have simply wanted out of here and took the best contract he could get to leave.  If that's the case, he's not greedy, but merely a jerk.  Although, if I were in his shoes, would I stay in an uncertain place?  I dunno...  The former itoop.org staff is working hard to get our web presence back.  After the domain 'itoop.org' lapsed (ahem, CFO...), we have now begun the process to secure www.itoopia.com.  It should be up and running soon.  So here at school, the latest thing is installing the Halo demo on the computers and having impromptu LAN parties when nobody 'official' is looking.  Just that the keyboard is so difficult to learn, after being acclimated to the controller.  That's why I brought my USB controller today, to see if it's any better.  Ok, folks.  Got work to do.  Bye.

      That's it.  After months of anguish and delays, my 'box is modded!  Finally!  I can't wait to watch DivX downloads on the machine and play all sorts of games!  Ahhh... However, school is making it increasingly difficult to keep up with game playing. Comp arc lab is taking up all sorts of time.  Then there's DSP lab.  Who the!?  What to do, what to do...?  Ok back to the work now.  See ya'll on the flip side.

      So this weekend will be nutty, maybe.  I have to study a bunch of stuff and actually start my CompArc lab and DSP lab.  The bright side is this: I managed to get my hands on Civ3, finally.  Also, my Xbox is being modded as we speak!  Hooray!!!  Can't wait to watch DivX straight off the 'box.  What up with these hugr rumours that Vidro will be traded and the money used towards a high priced guy, maybe Ivan Rodriguez.  Hey, I wouldn't mind salvaging Vidro's salary.  He won't be around next year anyway, might as well deal him and get something.  Otherwise, it's Vlad part 2.  Also, I'm very excited about the installation of FieldTurf at the BigO.  This finally means we won't have the worst turf in the league.  We'll skyrocket up, because FieldTurf is a fantastic product.  If you don't know what it is, I suggest reading up on it.  Alrighty, dudes.  I'm outta this here architecture.   Have fun...

      So very very bored!  I guess I'll update the blog with...news of...nothing. so I tried to renew the itoop.org domain and the stupid register.com site refuses to log me in!  What the hell do I do?  Instead of our wide circulation (of, like, a dozen) it's just down to me and the rest of the itoop crew.  How sad.  For those of you who don't know, the temporary address of www.itoop.org is now http://go.to/itoop  Man, I'm so bored, I'm checking every nook and/or cranny of the Red Dwarf Official web site.  Man, I love Red Dwarf.  Can't wait for the DVDs of Series 3 and 4 come out next month.  Speaking of geek, Star Trek 6 Special Edition dvd comes out at the end of the month.  Oh, happy day.  Just don't let my geekiness get out into the public.  Aw, who am I kidding.  I embrace my geekhood!  Embrace, I tells'ya!

      So Vlad goes and signs with the Anaheim Angels, eh?  For less money than the Expos offered?!  He rejected the Expos offer because he thought he'd get more on the open market, but that didn't happen.  He was blinded by his own greed.  And sure, Anaheim has an offensive powerhouse down there, but they need pitching.  I don't think they'll do much in that division, despite their sick offense.  Oakland lost Tejada, but they have an insane rotation.  Predictions are fine, but the reaosn the season is played is to actually see how the chips fall.  Alls I know is, if and when Vlad returns here in an interleague game, he'll get a tremendous boo.  He'll feel how quickly the MTL sports fan can turn on their own.  Plus, with the money saved from Vlad, the Expos went out and bought some nutty power of thei own, for very cheap.  Can't wait till opening day!

      So earlier this week someone at school suggested we get the old Eng gang together and have lunch.  Should I use names...aw, why not?  so Carmen's all like, let's go eat.  Then, the long-absent Sophie suggests to go to Le Taj, on Stanley, I believe.  Well, it turns out this is Neil's uncle's restaurant.  So, braving bitter cold, we show up and had a fantastic Indian buffet lunch.  Good times were had by all.  In unrelated news, should I or shouldn't I tutor at Champlain for $$?  I must ascertain whether I have the time.  Although, sweet sweet bank is very attractive.  How about this: my DSP lab section has been assigned: Wednesday.  Wednesday?  I don't have school Wednesday.  I have to go all the way there now.  Anyway, what else would I have been doing anyway?  Nothing, so it's probably better this way.  Cool everyone.  and by everyone reading, I mean Kevin, my only regular reader.  Bye all!

      Anyone who knows me is aware that I have a complete disdain for buses and bus drivers.  Starting this month, my bus pass ballooned by almost $6.  You'd expect better service, yes?  No!!!!   Today's bitter cold was blamed for buses showing up late or not at all!  Dozens of people all around me were freezing in the -20 degree weather while these bus people could simply care less.  Soon, it'll be cheaper to take a car downtown.  And way more convenient.  Instead of having Joe Ugly cough in my face, I'll be in the comfort of my own automocar, cruising around, listening to whatever music I like, rather than the bus driver's poor taste in Quebec Pop.  On an unrelated note, I finished my Return of the King video game and it was spectacular.  I unlocked more characters and secret levels, so the game's not done just yet.  All round a great game.  Ok homeys and homettes, I'm out for now. Be good!

Wow...I couldn't feel my face, my extremities were numb and I had a burning sensation on any bit of skin exposed to the bitter watches of the winter day.

      Well, it's back to school time.  A couple more months and I'm a professional!  Yay for me!  So I got the Return of the King videogame.  And it's excellent!  I can't believe how cool it is.  I've never played a game like this before.  The oliphaunts, Osgiliath, Gollum...it's great.  I finally finished it yesterday.  Now I wanna go back and play it again with the new characters I unlocked.  So I have MWF off this semester, basically.  However, I will most likely fill up that time with labs work...blech!  Ok, that's it for now.  Bye now!

      So during this break, I've done minimal studying.  I still have much to cover, but I think I can catch up.  Everything comes to a head on Thursday, when I get my Iron Ring, baby!  Can't wait.  So I finally headed down to Golden Bowl's new competitor, Winnsie (or however it's spelled).  This new Asian joint is pretty good.  It's just like Da Bowl, except they have a sushi bar, to boot.  The prices are comparable and the place is bigger.  I ordered the peanut butter dumplings and the garlic butter pork chops.  Oh my god.  Delicious!  I've never had pork that way.  I would most definitely recommend going there to anybody.  The prices are good, too.  Under $10, with no tax (technically, the tax is included, but whatever...).  So there's this band called Alexisonfire.  I saw a couple of their videos.  I hate them!  This is what they're all about: some guys cranks out distorted chords on their guitars, while the 'singer' SCREECHES at the top of his lungs...for 3 minutes.  This is music?  At the risk of sounding like an old fart, if that's what music is coming to, I'll keep my Bing Crosby LPs, thank you very much.  If ever you come across Alexisonfire, run, don't walk, away.  You'll thank me later.

I plan to catch up on movies I need to see, tv shows I've been neglecting and oh yeah!...studying.  I got 2 midterms when I get back.  So time to chillax.  I'll keep y'all posted.

      So I didn't go to school on Friday.  And I'm not planning to go tomorrow (Monday).  4 day weekend is amazing...if it weren't addled with work!  My iron ring ceremony is allegedly on the 4th of March.  However, I have 2 midterms that day! 2!  Imagine I'm forced to miss iron ring for a test?  Not cool.  Not remotely cool.  I've noticed my blog is usually made of little tidbits...Reading other people's blogs, I realized the stark difference.  Other people talk about where they went, what they did, have amusing anecdotes about stuff.  Nothing like that here.  Mainly cuz I don't go and do much.  In fact, what did I do just yesterday (Saturday)?  I worked on a prelab for DSP class.  All night.  Yeehaw!  Let the good times roll!     My Xbox calls my name, yet I am forced to turn a deaf ear.  I yearn to play games, however I have loads of stuff to do first.  Can't wait till next week: spring break.  Am I going to party like crazy and go somewhere?  Hell no.  I will stay at home and sleep/play video games all day.  That's how it goes.  So goodbye, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu.  I'll catch up will everyone (I have readers?) later.

      So Saturday we went to Le Milsa Brazilian restaurant for Dave/Mo's bday.  It's all you can eat of 10 different types of meat.  Sirloin, pork, filet mignon, chicken, etc etc.... It was incredible.  Sure, they also give you potatoes and salad but the meat's where it's at!  The Sirloin was so tender...it melts in the mouth.  What beautiful food, if food can be called beautiful. Dave and Mo each got a vintage Habs jersey as gifts and they seemed quite pleased.  Afterwards, we went to Dave's and hung out.  We caught parts of movies on the dish.  Jeepers Creepers 2 is hilarious!  It's one of those movies that's so bad, it's entertaining..unlike Gigli which is so bad, it's unwatchable.  Alright, dawgs, I'm out for now.  School work is a-calling!

      So I was at school for a good deal last night and had an overwhelming urge to go see the Super Furry Animals concert, just like that, out of the blue.  Alas, everyone bailed on me. (by everyone, I mean, like, 2 people, but whatever).  Besides that, today is Mo and Dave's bday dinner.  We're going to this Brazilian joint with supposedly 3 things on the menu.  One of them is all-you-can-eat meat.  hmmm....meat  Meanwhile, this stupid comp arc lab assignment #2 is causing much grief.  As I mentioned in the last post, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.  How true.  Word comes now that everyone has been doing the assignment incorrectly.  Back to the drawing board with a Monday dude date!  Argh.  Sad news for fans of Ed, as the "season finale" was aired yesterday.  17 episode season?  C'mon!  You so know that NBC isn't renewing it next season.  Oh well...here's to the happiest little show few people watched.

      Have I ever mentioned how great BitTorrent is?  I missed Scrubs last night, cuz I was watching 24.  No worries!  I simply downloaded it!  Everything works out fine!  Hooray!  On the other hand, DSP lab is nutty.  It's much harder doing it and DTSP at the same time, but DSP requires info from DTSP that we haven't learned yet.  Roughness...  On the next other hand, CompArc Lab doesn't seem too bad.  I'm hopinh to finish it on Friday.  although, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray, as they say...  Did anyone see 24 last night?  It was pretty nutty.  It's the halfway mark and who knows what will happen in the coming 12 episodes!  Wow, I love that show.  A big happy bday to Mo.  Happy bday Mo.

      So during Janet's super bowl hijinx, I read that TiVo usage went through the roof.  Everyone was rewinding the live feed to see if they saw what they thought they saw.  Anyway, Super Bowl fun was had at Mo's.  Lots of sodas and chips were consumed.  Afterwards, Ameeeeesh trashed talked at Halo, so we just had to go back to Dave's place to hash it out.  I would say we're all around the same skill level.  I want to play again when I'm less tired and queezy, as I was yesterday.  It's looking as if there will be another GameDay this weekend, but of a different sort.  Maybe exterior activities will occur (bowling, people? followed by dvds/movies/food/games?).  Only time will tell...I guess...  Oh, and the Super Bowl was pretty entertaining, too.   The preceding entry was brought to you by: "I Can't Wait" by the White Stripes.

      So, MegaDay went down at Dave's, yesterday.  11 people were there, including Dave: Allison, Samir, Karthik, Jean (fresh from 'Nam), Rice-a-roni, Carmen, Me, Mo, Franco and Joe.  We played Clue, Taboo, the Game of Life and the much loved Murder Mystery game, Mafia King.  At 1:30ish, everyone bolted.  Dave berated people for leaving so early, so I stayed.  Dave suggested we try and watch Gigli for a lark.  We tried, but after an hour, it was too unbearable.  Really rough....It's so bad.  Anyway, today was hockey, and we played for 2 hours.  This little punk kid was at the rink and outskated everyone.  He was such a hog, though.  Should have crosschecked him across the back!!!  Now, after a nice Terry's meal, I am tired and will soon retire to my bedchambers.  Tomorrow is the Super Bowl, with a gathering at Mo's.  I'm sure much merry-making will occur.  Oh yeah, about Mafia King, Carmen is so evil!!!  She's all like, "Oh I wonder who the murderer is" and nobody suspects her...Very deceitful...Gotta keep an eye on her next time we play...  Tricksy hobbit...

      So the new Batman movie is shaping up to be pretty good.  The cast is solid and advance reviews of the script are encouraging.  Check  urlLink here  for some info.  Anyway, they got a new bat-logo:    I like the logo.  It's un-polished looking, hopefully setting the tone for the movie.  New pics have emerged of Batman's new set of wheel:      Before you start crying "what did they do to the Batmobile", this design is very reminiscent of the vehicle Batman drove in Frank Miller's landmark "The Dark Knight Returns" mini-series from the 80s.  If the movie is anywhere near as good as that comic, then we're in for a treat.

      Once in a while, you hear of something so magical that it can only be spoken of in whispers. Anything louder than that and it disappears. Our good friend Hitch spoke to me of such a thing: a vending machine that spits out 2 cans of Coke for every 1 button pressed. Too good to be true, I thought. It was not.  The story was that in the Pulp and Paper building, the Coke machine gives 2 cans. Problem #1: Where the hell is the P&P building? It turns out it's nestled quietly between McConnell Engineering and Otto Maass Chemistry. Only if you know it's there, will you find it. One can only see it if one believes its existence. A thirsty Neil and I decided the time was ripe to get our Coke.  We entered through the main doors. To our left is a long, curving staircase going deep down. Ahead, a hallway. We chose to go down the hall. There was a sign that told visitors to register at the booth. However, the booth was temporarily vacated. Our luck! At the end of the hall, deadend. We were turning around when some lady from an office asked "May I help you?" Quickly thinking on my feet, I said, "We're looking for the exit." She told us that we'd have to leave by the way we came in. Whew! Dodged a bullet there.  Then Neil spoke. "Are there any vending machines in this building?" I cringed. She said no. An obvious lie.  We retraced our steps and went downstairs, revealing a labyrinth of halls. Suddenly, security people appeared down one hall, so we quickly fled down the opposite one. Scurrying down, we stumbled upon an open area, with one sad-looking table. It was lit, however, by a beautiful Coke machine glow. We'd found the holy grail.  Putting the dollar in the machine, I hesistated. Do all the buttons gives 2 cans? Or just one? I pressed the first Coke button firmly. Chunk-a-chunk-a-chunk...a can rolled down. We waited, holding our breath.  ...  Chunk-a-chunk-a-chunk! Another can! We'd succeeded! We grabbed the cans, ran up the stairs and bolted out the doors.  Later that day, Hitch informed me that there was an underground passage from Otto Maass leading to the basement of P&P, thereby avoiding all security and sign-in booths. I dunno about you but this way was much more fun.

      Putting aside my better judgment, I saw not no e, but two movies this weekend.  I saw Jersey Girl and Dawn of the Dead.  I didn't know what to expect from Jersey Girl, a PG-13 Kevin Smith movie.  It's no secret that I'm a Kevin Smith fanboy, but would his core audience like the movie?  I, for one, did very much enjoy it.  IT could have fallen into sappy sentimentality, but for the most part steered clear of cheesiness.  It was very funny, to boot.  Dawn of the Dead was amazing.  Sure, you never learn what the zombies intentions are (do you ever in these type of movies?).  Also, you don't know what turned them into zombies.  And some choices by the characters are quesitonable but I must admit that this is one of the best zombie movies you'll ever see.  It's very well made.  If you ever wanted to see almost unbearable violence and gore against zombies (and some not), then you gotta see this flick.  It's so intense, from beginning to end.  Finally, they made a quality zombie movie.   Anyway, my l reviews of both movies should appear on itoopia.com later this week.

      Alright, so I came up with a new band name.  The Bat Rastards.  Let it churn in your head for a few days.  It's pretty catchy.  We'll see.  I wonder if any band practices will come about soon (although I highly doubt it).  Sigh...  So I finally got my Weezer DVD today.  The UPS guy returned today and I signed for it.  It contains all the Weezer videos, even some made only for the DVD.  There are tons of behind the scenes stuff, too.  I can't wait to get around to watching those, as well.  All in due time.  To all those who read this blog and have yet to complete their smallworld.com fantasy baseball team: do it now!  I hate it when a league has people who have incomplete teams that dwell at the bottom of the league with zero points!  How it irks me!!  Know what?  I'm gonna fire off an email to people who have yet to fill out their team.  The season starts on Tuesday with the Yankees taking on the Devil Rays in Japan.  I'm starting a mini-crazy at school with these cool wristbands.  I must thank Rez for introducing me to wristbands.  Shout out to Rez.  My autobots one is very fantastic.  I wish I had the Decepticon one to complement it, but those are hard to find.  Anyone see the box art for the Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD set coming out in September?  Looks pretty swanky.  That is a must-purchase item on my list. Speaking of Star Wars, the Clone Wars cartoon starts up again tonight.  Stupid CRTC doesn't alow us to get Cartoon Network, so I must find it on the net, through illicit means.  Damn you, CRTC!!!  Amazing news for Montreal baseball fans.  The Score has picked up the Expos nationally!  From coast to coast, at least 25 games will be broadcast.  Add to that the RDS games, plus the 6 Expos-Jays games...plus the odd TBS/WPIx broadcast and we get 50+ games on tv.  Weird how the franchise is being run like a real team only after MLB takes over.  I wish I had more free time so I could continue to write songs for the band.  Writing songs is very difficult.  Well, at least writing semi-decent songs is.  I'm by no means any good and it's hard.  Congrats to Dead For Twenty Days for landing an opening slot gig for alexisonfire.  Even though my hatred for noted screamers alexisonfire is well documented, I must congratulate my boys in DFTF in their achievement.  Hooray for them!

      As an addendum to JBo's latest blog entry:  All alexisonfire fans, take note:  That band is awful.  They set new standards to being awful.  I'd rather listen to a William Hung two-fer Tuesday than sit through an alexisonfire 'song'.  They are talentless hacks.  Screaming into a mic takes ZERO talent.  None!  Maybe those guys behind the 'singer' can play well but who even know?!  You can't hear them for all the screaming and yelling and the biting, flavin'...m'hoy...   That is all.

      So I'm all hyped about getting the new Weezer DVD.  It's their first one and it has tons of rare footgae and all the music videos, including some made especially for the DVD.  So I go to DVd Passion and they don't have it.  So I go to Future Shop and they don't have it either.  I was so frustrated.  I eventually went to futureshop.ca and ordered it online, with free shipping.  It's only $12.  Yay!  Anyone see the hilarious first half of The Simpsons this past week?  The Star Wars parody was hilarious.  Have I mentioned my disdain for school and everything school related?  So this Friday, the new Kevin Smith movie opens.  I dunno about this one.  It's different from his other stuff (i.e. not vulgar to the extreme).  Will I like it?  Only time will tell.  You know what DVD  did  come out?  "Transformers Season 3, part 2 + Season 4".  And it's only $59, not the ridiculous $89 the other season parts cost. One day...one day...  Speaking of TF, I finally got my Autobots wristband.  Again, yay for me!

      Ok, I love this DVD Profiler program.  It's the most mind-bogglingly deep, yet simple, program to use to make a database of your dvds.  The best part is, you can upload your info and others can view what you have!  I'm gonna include my link on the side, so y'all can check out what I own, as well as see how great this program is.

      Yesterday was a whirlwind day.  It started off wih Dave and I going to McDonald's/Wal-Mart.  So naturally, it turned into us going to Future Shop, too.  Then we went to Microplay.  Then we went to Dav'es house.  Then we went to St-Bruno mall for some reason.  Then we went to the Microplay in Candiac.  Then we went to Justin's to watch the (boring) hockey game.  Then we went to McDonald's again!!!  Then I came home and read a little before sleeping.  At Justin's we rewatched some Strong Bad emails.  Lately, I thought it was getting non-funny.  I don't know if it was the late hour, but I laughed at some that I previously thought were unfunny.  Oh well.  The reaction to my rap (posted below) was favourable.  People seem to like my lyrical skizzills.  Yay for me!  I'm also trying to put a link to this little window showcasing features of the upcoming Weezer DVD.  I hope it works.  If it does, you should see it on the righthand side somewheres.

      Anyone who knows me (and Chris) knows we've been writing semi-satirical raps for years (since the Champlain days).  Well, Chris's new article on the ol' itoopia.com site inspired me to get out the old quill and write a new rap.  Here it is:  "Who's Better Than Me?"  Back up, back up, you better Watch your step. Spitting lyrics like scarabs like I'm Imhotep. My ryhmes are like parabs for the Biblical set. Spending dollars, like ballers, on my Private jet.  When I got problems I don't Complain to ya. Taking charge of matters like Lawrence of Arabia. So talented, fill the stadia. My music blasts through every Cafeteria.  So many others don't hold a Candle to me. I look in the mirror, reflect so Handsomely. TV censors can't Handle me, Cuz when I get on, I cause a Scandal, see?  All my peeps in the corner say "You da man. Put your mind to it and do Whatever you can. If you run out of ink, you can Use my pen, Cuz you're so prolific, you're my West Asian 'N'!"  If I rated my flows, they'd get Three thumbs up. Eleven on ten, 6 stars, Sup? Knock'em out of the park, grand slam Batter up. Candy on each arm, Various cup.  So back up, back up, you better Back the 'eff' away! I don't know how much more You can take. You're bogus, you whack, you phony, You fake. Like a guest on a show hosted by Ricki Lake.  All hail me, hail me. I'm beyond Compare. I'm ubiquitous unlike Picard's Thinning hair. You mess with me, it's you I Ensnare. Step right up, step right up if You dare.    I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

      So yesterday was the much ballyhooed WrestleMania XX. It was hyped as the biggest, baddest WM of them all.  Not quite.  It was pretty lame.  Undertaker?  Puhlease!  Big Show?   Ugh.  The only bright spots were Brock LEsnar giving the finger to the crowd before being "stunned" by Austin, Rey Mysterio and the last match of the night.  Very bloody!  Wow.  People were gushing blood all over the place.  Amazing.  Much fun was had.  Around 10 people crowded around in JBo's basement, eating various chips/chocolates.  Pretty fun, but the wrestling could have been better.  Meanwhile, I got a Palm Pilot.  It's not a fancy one or anything, but it's neat.  The Zire m150.  So today, I downloaded the proper software to hotsync it with my computer, as well as a bunch of games and apps and stuff.  Ill have to soon figure out how to port them onto the Palm.  As long as I get some neato games working, I'll be happy!  I pre-ordered ESPN MLB for the Xbox off amazon.ca, as well as the upcoming Weezer DVD.  The DVD was $12, so I couldn't resist.  By using my contacts at www.redflagdeals.com, I was able to conjure up a $5 coupon for the site, so I got a nice little discount off the total price.  Free shipping, too!  Yay for me.  So Dave owed me money, so he gave me a $5US bill.  So this morning I go up to the exchange office in the train station downtown.  The guy in front of me had just exchanged hundreds of dollars...then it was my turn.  I show up, plop the $5 on the counter and got $6.50-something in return.  How embarrassing.  Alrighty, ya'll.  That's it for now!  Bye!  By the way, Chris, if you're reading this, stop.  I know how much you loathe blogs!!  :p

      So, I have a few things to say about hockey.  I heard someone say that hockey is a minor league sport that thinks it's a major league sport.  How true it is.  Besides a few key cities, nobody gives a damn and a half about hockey and now there's more reason why. Todd Bertuzzi goes and wails on this dude from behind, breaking his friggin' neck.  Is this gonna finally allow the sport to crack the fickle US market?  Instead of having finesse and skill on display, sadly the biggest hockey news of the year is this assault.  I understand they try to sell hockey to the US south by promoting the violence but seriously...who's gonna be turned on by that?  Bertuzzi is an ass-monkey for what he did.  It brings the wrong type of spotlight to the sport and it may seriously damage or even end the victim's career.  Secondly, the trade deadline is waaaay too close to the playoffs.  At this rate why not have it the last day of the season?  It's just as much of a joke!  The teams in the playoff picture just abduct whoever they want from the have-not teams and then say goodbye to these hired guns at season's end.  Then next year, the same thing will go on.  What a pathetic joke it is.  They should move the deadline back a month.  That way, you're not so close to the end of the season so as to keep some mystery alive.  Will a certain gamble pay off?  Well, with the deadline as it is, there are no gambles.  You know you're in the playoffs, so it's just loading up.  Meh!  I don't *hair* about it!  I woke up this morning feeling miserable.  So I went to the doctor and sure enough, my reoccuring throat infection flared up again.  I was prescribed antibiotics.  Also, I explained to the doc some problems I've been having and it looks like I am indeed lactose intolerant.  I stopped having dairy for a few days and felt fine, but this morning I experimented with a glass of milk and almost immediately: bad results.  At lunch, I had cheese in my sandwich and...bad results.  From now on, if I want dairy products, I'm gonna make sure I'm not leaving the house soon afterwards.  Alright, blogmonkeys (to appropriate JBo's term), I'm sooooo out of this hizzy!

      Ok, so Thursday was the big Iron Ring day.  We all attended a secret ceremony where only those with rings or those receiving them can attend.  Wow.  It was the cheesiest thing ever.  This is what it's like inside:  [Selections of the following has been omitted to protect the integrity of the Iron Ring ceremony] an anvil and [removed]... chain in my left [removed].  [removed]...Rudyard Kipling [removed]..."we know nothing" [removed]... end.   So, afterwards, the wine and cheese was just that: cheese.  What a garbage fest!  all the food was taken quickly.  What a bust.  Good thing Neil hooked it up at his uncle's restaurant, Le Taj.  We got a crazy discount of this nutty, multicourse meal, including butter chicken.  Hmm...I love that place.  Special kudos go to Neil's uncle's wicked suit.  Very nice.  About 30 of us were there, I figured.  We really packed that place.  Afterwards, we wen to Club Nexxt.  In our honour, they dropped the cover charge for McGill students and gave out a coupon for 1 free beer.  However, this dude Anthony (white guy, crazy dreads) got hold of a whole roll of those beer coupons, and was giving them to anyone who asked.  That joint must have made so little money off us, it's incredible. Highlights include: -Franco drunk (a sight to behold) -Mark drunk (amusing) -Kevin losing his ring...twice! -Neil drunk (entertaining as always)  Finally, I got home at 4am-ish.  Tired, yes, but ringed, as well, which made it worth it.   **ADDENDUM** so the following day, I had to make up for all the lost time from Iron Ring day.  So I was at school a solid 12 hours, from 1:30pm to 1:30am-ish.  Afterwards, JBo showed up at school and we stayed a bit, all the while resisting the cheap drinks at the CS party downstairs in Trottier.  Neil and I had to finish a DSP lab.  We'd had 3 weeks to do it, but only started yesterday...and got 8/9ths of it done!!  We're great...although, just wait for the demo... :( We finally left, picked up Dave at his house, around 2:30am, and went to McDonald's (hey, we were starving!).  Upon finding out that Friday's trio is fish, we promptly left and pursued eating activities at Arahova, which is open till 5am.  We had some great souvlakis.  The bad thing with souvlakis is that in the morning, the bedroom stinks of garlic.  But again, fun was had by everyone.  Aaaaahhh, those were the days, we'll say one day.  Alright, back to the lab report!  See ya later!

      Today's guest writer is Celine Ho:  "Iron ring day! Vrej is wearing a tie! he was supposed to wear his Bugs Bunny tie but he didn't coz it wasn't tied properly... boo! Anyway, all these fours years have come to this: a ring that we will forever wear on our pinkie. What does it represent?? I guess it shows that we've been through thick and thin in this engineer program. It also looks nice to wear because it's silver and nicely shaped.  I've known Vrej since primary school, he was in my grade 1 (or kindergarden) class and he hasn't changed a bit. I'll bring those kiddy pics to school one day and show you... ;) He's the same ol' Vrej... we'll see in a few years. I'm sure he'll still be the same.  Anyway, Vrej is back.  Celine :) "  Second guest writer is Vrej...Vrej Hezaran, yes...:  "I'm so excited about getting my iron ring day today. Also, I think Joe Greiss is the pinnacle of humanity. Oh yeah, and there are 10 kinds of people: those who know binary, and those who don't. See, I really am Vrej Hezaran."  Hezky Vrej Hezaran

      As predicted, RotK ruled the Oscars.  However, I don't think anyone thought it would sweep every category in which it was nominated!  11 for 11.  Wow.  It tied Ben-Hur and Titanic for most awards by a single movie.  Well deserved, men.  I have many Xbox games coming my way soon (thank you Bassem).  However, I will not have much time to enjoy them.  This will be a hectic week.  2 DTSP assignments, 2 midterms, 1 DSP lab to seriously start working on, plus Iron Ring festivities.  In the words of James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause, "You're tearing me apart!" The only solution is to take one day at a time and do whatever I can.  Once I get my ring, I will undoubtedly be much happier.  Ooooh, I believe there are strawberries in the fridge.  Can't wait to get at those.  So I had a McDonald's coupon that would get me a hamburger and small fries for 99 cents.  Turns out the coupon had a typo; it was supposed to be $1.99, I think.  Anyway, so the guy apologized and pretended I gave him a different coupon, so there would be something to show in the books at the end of the day.  So, I got the burger and fries for a grand total of $0.81.  Cheapest lunch ever.

      So I finally did it.  I wrote my last undergrad exam.  Ahhhhhhh the sweet feeling of being finished school after all these years.  So afterwards, we went to AMC Forum to the former Jillian's restaurant.  We ate and watch the hockey game.  I predicted a 4-1 TB win, but they only won 3-1....pity.  Anyway, a good time was had by all.  Over a dozen peeps from school attended and we had fun.  Then we went upstairs to the arcade place and the fun began.  Karthik asked this big tough-looking black guy if he could play table hockey.  The guy told him to back the eff away.  Karthik doesn't take kindly to things of that nature and a seriously murderous gleam entered his eyes.  He was immovable.  The guy started shoving him, unprovoked.  Soon, 10 people were in a huge shoving match, almost toppling the table hockey set.  In the middle was Bassem, holding people apart.  If I thought Karthik was immovable, man, Bassem was a rock.  So much so that I'm giving him the nickname The Rock from now on.  Anyway, more people jumped in and the fight was separated, with the big guy's glasses almost broken.  Then we all left.

      So last night, Tim Meadows was on Kilborn.  Man, do I enjoy him.  He's such a funny dude, too bad, he's doing nothing nowdays.  Sigh...  So on The Simpsons a few weeks back, they went to a science fiction convention.  It was called Bi-Mon Sci-fi Con.  I feel cheated.  I thought I came up with To-Ron Sci-Fi Con and its weaker brother, Mon Sci-Fi Con.  Oh well... :(

      Have you seen google's new webmail thing, Gmail?  It's like hotmail, except you can store 1 GB of emails and stuff.  Perfect if I download something huge elsewhere.  I can send it to myself and re-coup it when I get home.  Also, it incorporates google into the email.  I can therefore search my emails using google.  Neat.  Ok, has anyone seen this new Pizza Hut promotion?  You order pizza and they send you a DVD to watch with your pizza.  The 3 choices of movies are: Lost in Space, Weekend at Bernie's and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  Yeah, I can't wait till the 2nd phase of this promotion when they give out Masters of the Universe, Death Becomes Her and Ski School.  Jesus, man!  Who's the ad wizard behind giving bum-f*** nothing movies with pizza?  I laughed out loud when I saw that commercial.  To all those skipping the home opener to watch Game 1 on tv: I am severely disappointed.

      Well, the Flames/Canucks series came to an excellent end.  The best series of the first round looked like it was over until Vancouver scored with 5 seconds left in the third, tying it.  But worry not, for Calgary came back and won in overtime, sending the pansy Canucks packing.  Take that, Bertuzzi.  Loser.  Day 2 of my break till my next exam begins thusly: wake up at 11:45.  Read newspaper, come to computer, write this entry.  So the Canadiens won.  Wow.  Those Boston losers must be crying into their Bruins jerseys.  Thornton was such a non-entity that people were calling for him to be stripped of his captain-"C".  The good thing about having some time: catching up on DVDs. The bad thing: not much to talk about on blogs.

      Yup!  I got nothing for a while.  My last exam is on the 29th.  Hooray!!  I get to catch up on DVDs.  Yehess...  Also, I get to look forward to the baseball home opener.  I cannot wait.  I finally saw  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep , and it was very funny...and had a little message, to boot, about old people still being useful.  Anyway, it was a fun movie.  Very weird, but fun.  Ossie Davis was hilarious.  Kill Bill: Vol.2 surpasses the first, so you should check that out, too.  As for me, I'm gonna play some video games, watch some movies and generally chill for now.  Ahh....the good life.

      Did you see the hockey game yesterday?  "Oh, I'm Kovalev!  I will grab my wrist and abandon the puck.  Not only that, but I will take Souray out of the play, as well.  Oh, look at me act!"  Loser.  Meanwhile, the Calgary/Vancouver series has gotta be the most exciting series out there.  Very fun to watch.  Go Flamos!  What the hell is up with these Expos?  Everyone predicted their pitching would suck, but they'd have nuts hitting.  Now that the season started, it's the opposite!!   Their pitching is something like 3rd best in the league but their hitting is last.  Dead last.  They're batting a collective .190!  The only team nearly as bad it...the Yankees!  They're somewhere near .208.  Hopefully, if their batting wakes up, they'll win many games.  Good job, Omar, on signing Livan Hernandez!  Yay!  Man, so this final on Friday?  Screwed!  What am I to do?  Sooooo nutty.  Why did I ever volunteer to do what's basically Signals 3?  Oh my...  After Friday, my next (and last) exam is on April 29th, so I have plenty of time to do that.  So, Friday night:  Kill Bill: Vol.2?  Perhaps!  So, I downloaded all 20 episodes of Star Wars Clone Wars cartoon and made a VCD out of them.  It's so neat.  I must rewatch it.  So, the lady from SNC calls and says she'll call back next week to tell me when I start.  When I start?  She didn't even outright tell me I got the job.  I guess I did... Meanwhile x2, I keep checking the online posting of Tyco Brossard.  I've been rejected for 5 of the 6 positions I applied for.  But the 6th...I meet the criteria!  Hopefully, I'll get an interview.  Imagine working in Brossard?  Screw SNC's summer position, if that's the case.  This would be permanent!  Anyway, I'm out homeys.  P.S.: I will update some stuff on itoopia.com next week.  Stuff is busy now.

      So I was watching the Expos game today.  Yesterday, they won 1-0 and today, lost 4-1.  What's the matter with them?  Before the season started, everyone thought the hitting would be potent and the pitching, suspect.  But now it's the opposite!  The pitching rocks but they can't hit to save their lives!  Argh!  It's so frustrating.  Once the hitting wakes up, though, watch out, NL East.  This team will win a bunch of games.  Anyway, I was watching the game and Cliff Floyd injured himself, chugging to first base.  This guy is 6'4'', 230+ pounds.  As he's running, he pulls something.  When you're that big, I suppose it's easy to pull something.  That weight must be a tremendous strain on his frame.  At least he's all built and stuff.  Maybe he can deal with it better than, say, Yao Ming.  Sure, Yao is also muscular, but his weight is divided among his body more.  He's like a horse.  If he even breaks his leg they gotta shoot him.    Has anyone seen that Yao Ming is going out with some star on the Chinese woman's basketball team?  Wouldn't it be hilarious if they have kids and they're, like, hobbit-size?  Man, what a week this will be.  Reports due, finals to study for...lab to attempt to demo at the last minute (actually, after the last minute).  Sigh...  Oh, and the Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons ended this week with a bang.  Episodes 18 and 19 had Anakin fighting Asaaj Ventress on Yavin 4.  Very cool.  The rain sizzling on the lightsabres was great.  Then in episode 20, they introduced General Grievous (pictured below).  He's a lightsabre wielding Droid general and a badass, to boot.  This guy is gonna be a villain in episode 3 and allegedly has a fight with Obi-Wan.  If that fight is anything close to his first appearance in this cartoon, then it will be awesome.  Go download the episodes from www.suprnova.org or  urlLink here .  Well worth it.  I hope the success of these Genndy Tartakovsky made cartoons sparks a full length animated series.  That would be wicked. All rightey, peeps.  It's time to overeat.  It's Easter.

      Yesterday was the end of an era.  I attended my last lecture as an undergraduate student (for the record, it was DTSP, of which I understoof little).  I can't even understand what this means, having finished school.  Sure, I still have a few reports to hand in, and 2 finals, but wow!  Never to attend a lecture.  Nice.  And as a bonus surprise, I got a call yesterday for an interview at SNC for a summer position.  Sure, it's nothing permanent, but it'll be good experience.  The interview went well.  The lady asked me a few questions and made sure I know how to write and speak and generally found out if I was interested.  She eventually said I'm an excellent candidate for the position and she'll find out next week what happens.  The position would be technical writing, more specifically, writing the help files for their in-house project management software, or something.  Let's see what becomes of this.

      Aha!!  Today, the Expos start the season!!  Excellent....let's go!  Skimming through my regular blogs (by my fellow ECE students), there is a feeling of sadness going around.  People are getting sentimental about this being the last week.  I didn't even realize.  Thursday marks my last undergraduate lecture (I hope).  I suppose it is sad.  But it's not the same since we moved to Trottier.  Back in McConnell, we used to hang in McC12, eating lunch and stuff.  Sure, Trottier has the Halo lab, but it's not the same.  Remember in PErfect Strangers, when they moved from the apartment to the house?  It wasn't the same after that.  Same thing.  Anyway, no time to think about stuff.  Too many things this week to realize what's going on.

But alas, everything is a repeat (except for Arrested Development, hooray!).  I heard the The Simpsons was new today, but apparently, that's false.  I don't know what to believe anymore.  Ok, back to work.

      Wow, I've been at school a lot lately, with no end in sight.  So much to work on, most specifically Comp arc lab project.  Argh! Tomorrow is Saturday, which will be spent at school.  Tonight will be spent doing school-related stuff.  Sunday will see me write a DSP lab report.  Next week...well, I don't even wanna think about next week.  I haven't even had time to explore my Weezer DVD that I bought recently.  Fie, oh fie!  Whew, another deadline met!  Stupid DTSP assignment!!  What's the teacher's problem anyway!?  Why can't baseball season start any sooner?  Anyway, I'm out for now.

      So I finally got paid yesterday.  Or is it payed?  I never know.  Anyway, what a feeling it is to have a poopload of $$ dropped into one's account.  The possibilities seem endless.  I prompty bought the Red Dwarf DVDs I've been meaning to get for a while.  I am satisfied.  Not only that, but I tutored and mowed a bunch of lawns, too.  How long before I burn out?  In other news, I joined Nautilus Plus today.  I plan on going after work a couple of days a week.  Gotta get in shape!  Other than that, same old, same old.  The Enterprise season finale was nutzoid (but I won't go into details, in case some of you [ahem, Chris!] haven't seen it!).  But trust me, it's seriously whack!  I'm doing research into getting a digital camera.  Probably sometime next week, I'll get one, but I'm not sure yet.  I gotta see what Brault & Martineau have.  Alright, that's it for now.  In case any of you are wondering why there's not Heel of the Week on the ol' Itoopia.com, it's cuz I can't think of anything.  The well is dry.  Things don't bother me as much since school ended and I'm getting income.  Wow.  Maybe I've turned a leaf.  By the way,  urlLink here 's a compilation of some of the best moments of movie swearing, complete with clips.  Ahhhh, I'm such a Kevin Smith fanboy.  urlLink

      Alright, peeps, you must go see Supersize Me.  It's a documentary about this guy who decided to eat nothing but McDonald's for a month...and how he almost dies.  After seeing it, I never want to eat fast food again.  I'm serious.  You must see this movie.  It's hilarious and scary at the same time.

      So, at work, my supervisor was supposed to show me a bunch of stuff last week so that I can get some work started while she takes 2 weeks vacation.  Fast forward to around 3:30 today, the day before she leaves.  She rushes through tons of things.  Then she apologizes because she didn't have time for me last week.  The best part: she said she's sorry that I might not have much work to do while she's gone, but at least I'm getting paid. My thoughts exactly!  By the by, I got a new cell phone plan.  It's the free weekends.  So feel free to call from Friday 8pm to Monday 7am.  I had to alter my number, though, so make note.  It's now (514) 554-VREJ.  Oh yeah, Justin was wondering about this.  The baseball player with "the wife" is the Dodgers' Jose Lima.  Pic below:     That is all.

      So after 11 years, one of my must-see TV shows goes off the air.  I enjoyed Frasier from day 1 and it's sad to see it go.  Recalling countless classic episodes, I desperately hoped the last one would be good.  The fact that the original writers (who wrote the show to 5 consecutive Best Comedy Emmys...5!!!  Unheard of!) returned this season meant that the quality went back up and the final episode was funny and avoided being like most last episodes.  It was funny and a touch sentimental.  But good throughout.  Bye Frasier...  On another note, my lack of posts is due to the fact that I don't have net access at work.  Otherwise, I'd be writing more (during my lunch break, of course).

      Overheard at work; subject: gay marriages  "C'est un abomination!  Un abomination!  Sous peu, on va être capable de marier des chiens!  Des chiens et des chats!  On va parler 4 langues: l'anglais, le français, le chien et le chat!"  I thought that was too funny.

      So I've completed an entire week at work and I've pretty much got nothing done.  First, my cubicle was usurped by someone else.  So now, I have an office on the clear other side of the floor...where there is nobody.  Second, I didn't have a computer for the first 3 days.  Then, I got a computer, but couldn't log on because it wasn't hooked up to the network.  After that, the proper software I need wasn't installed.  Then, it's the weekend.  So, it's been a very long week of nothing-doing.  So, yes, I missed the Friends finally.  People are all like "did you see Friends?"  I say "no".  I actually don't care about it.  I've seen, what, a dozen, 15 episodes?  What I care about will be the final Frasier.  I've seen every Frasier episode since the day it started, back in Sept. 1993.  What a brilliant show it is.  Next Thursday will be a sad, sad day.

      So today was my first day of work.  I've never worked in an office before.  I met up with the lady I'll be working with.  She's nice.  I also met out mutual boss.  He seems like an affable chap...but we'll see... However, even though the order was placed weeks ago, someone screwed up and I didn't have a computer!  So I pretty much did nothing and got extremely bored all day.  I never realized how long a day is when you're not sleeping through the entire morning.  So months ago, I heard rumblings about a Star Wars tv show.  The fact that they made the Clone Wars cartoons might have been an indication that the eventual show would be animated (hence, testing the market with 3 minute shorts).  But today comes this news, from  urlLink theforce.net , the leading SW news site:  ----- More SW TV Series Confirmation Mon, May 03, 04 01:00:20 AM EDT   Sean writes in with this cool report to confirm work on a SW TV Show is most definitely happening:  I asked him about Star Wars' future and he got really excited and told me in thinly veiled comments that it is going to TV (live-action) . He couldn't go into details because he was under a legal contract.  So I asked this gentlemen if the show was pre-EP4, he said maybe with a smile, then I asked about Vader, and he had the same response, same with Chewbacca, same with Tarkin. Anyways he said Lucasfilm was really excited about this, and he did mention that there were to be no Episodes 7-9.   We've got more coming this week, but let's just say a TV Show is a definite thing, according to documents being distributed to licensees and marketing people now. ----  What to make of this?  I always thought a live action show would be amazing, but only if it had new characters, weaving in and out of the original trilogy storyline.  The SW universe is huge and could sustain some great stories (to wit: KotOR).  Let's see what comes of this.  It had better be good.

      So last week was TV-Turnoff Week; a week where everyone was supposed to turn off the tv and do something more contructive.  I say to hell with these damned I'm-better-than-you types who ridicule us tv watchers.  You know when someone is asked what their favourite show is and they say "Oh, I don't watch tv"?  Bulls***!  Everyone watches tv, ok?  Some people like claiming they don't cuz it makes them feel intellectual.  They can go screw themselves.  Sure television is usually full of the stupidest, most insipid content, but still.  I like TV.  Which brings me to my next point.  So Friends is ending this week.  It's like it's the end of the world!  I've seen a handful of episodes in my day and they were generally amusing.  But the way the media is presenting it, it's as if the days will darken and rivers will overflow once it goes off the air.  I wonder if people will make as much noise when Frasier (yes, a superior show) end the following week?  Sigh...  So I was watching the trailer to Van Helsing and I noticed something.  Why is it called The Wolfman, capital T and W?  I mean, there's Dracula, Frankenstein's monster (not Frankenstein, as some people like saying.  To quote Red Dwarf "It's a mistake commonly made by incredibly stupid people").  But it's always The Wolfman.  Even if there was an entire pack of Wolfmen, each one would individually be called The Wolfman.  Maybe it's because the only attack one at a time.  But by that token, any henchman in a kung fu movie should be called The Henchman, cuz they seem to attack one at a time, too.  Whatever.  So finally, we get pictures of Christian Bale as the new Batman.  The costume is looking neat, a little different than we've seen.  I'm hoping for some better, more telling pictures but here are a couple:

      So I'm at the Gap cuz I saw a big sign advertizing shirts that looked neat.  So I pick one and go to the cash and there's this nice-looking girl servicing the cash.  She takes the shirt and expertly folds it and places it in the bag.  So I quip, "Do they train you to fold like that or are you just good at folding?"  To which she replies, "Hahaha, they don't train us, no.  But if you want, I could show you how to fold later."  Me, being much less bright than the light bulb of Callista Flockhart's fridge, explained that no, I was already late on my lunch break.  Sigh...   So, glad to see Ontarians decided not to be swayed by those radical, hicks-in-disguise Conservatives.  That's right.  I cannot understand these Westerners.  Maybe they should separate and relieve us of grief.

      So I'm walking down Ste. Catherine street and they're filming some movie at the Anglican church, next to the Bay.  It's a wedding scene.  According to the signs, the movie is called "I Do But...", not to be confused with "I Do Butts", which plays late at night on the dish. Seriously, though, I did some research and the movie is actually called "I Do (But I Don't)" starring Denise Richards, for the Lifetime Network.  Bew...

      So I understand that people don't wanna vote Liberal, but what's the alternative?  I will not stand for a Conservative government.  They're the devil!  So, fine people might be tempted to go for the NDP or whatnot.  That's good and well, but people, don't think ideologically.  Think realistically.  A vote for anyone other than Liberals is a vote for the Conservatives.  I'm not saying this in support of the Liberals.  But if you vote for someone else, it just means the Conservatives have an easier shot at it.  And who are the Conservatives?  They're the few PCs that were left merged with the masses of Alliance/Reform yahoos!  You want the Reform party governing Canada?   And don't talk to me about voting Bloc cuz they'll represent Quebec.  BS!  Since I saw their tv commercials, I hate them even more.  "On veut un Quebec qui nous resemble."?  WTF is that about?  That's racism hidden under solidarity.  They're pretty much saying they wanna a white, French Quebec.  That's good if you're white and can pass off as French, but I for one despise them.  And who founded the Blob?  Former Conservatives.   Adn the NDP are nice and all but they're living in a dream world.  Poor guys.  Please, PLEASE do not elect the Conservatives.  It's the equivalent of voting Republican.  And voting for another party with no realistic shot is the equivalent of voting Ralph Nader in the US.  That being said, Brossard is back, baby!  Take that, Jacques Olivier and Longueuil.  Y'all can suck my diznik!

      Take THAT, Italy.  I'm sick of your crybaby ways.  "Oh, Sweden/Denmark will conspire to draw a 2-2 final, so that we, the Italians (the rightful heirs of soccer), will get ousted!  Unfair!"  I'm sick of your bitching!  Ha!  Good riddance.  Take Totti with you!  So I picked up the new Wilco album...and it's weird, straight down to the package!  Nowhere is there an indication as to the band or the album's name, except on the sides.  And that track with 12 minutes of guitar fuzz is odd.  But the regular songs are pretty nice.  After an initial listen, I prefer Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but I'll spin the new disc a few times before rendering judgment.

      So I took the plunge and got a digital camera.  The Minolta Dimage G400.  It's 4Megapixels and has a 3x optical zoom.  It accepts both SD cards and Memory Sticks.  It's pretty neat.  I'll play around with it, take pics and videos and then comment some more.  So the Expos are retiring Tim Raines's number tomorrow and I will be there.  It's a lone bright spot in this miserable season.  What's that?  Lakers lost?!  Muahahahahahahahah!!  Sorry, Kobe, but I guess you'll be able to cry all the way to prison.  So the new Wilco album is coming out this Tuesday and I've heard mixed reviews.  Spin magazine called it too weird.  They said it's nutz experimental.  The Gazette gave it 4.5/5, saying it gets better with each listen.  All I know is that there is one song that's 15 minutes long, where the last 13 minutes is such distortion.  Weird, guy!  Oh well, they have my money. And I'm seeing the show on Auguest 5th.  That's it for now.

      Every chance he gets, Vin Diesel proclaims how much of a Dungeons & Dragons nerd he is.  Is this possible?  If so, even I'm gonna call him a geek.  He seems to know his stuff, from quotes I've read.  I could just imagine him sitting around a table, arguing with the DM about the dexterity check needed to pick a lock.  The geeky nerd, on an obvious power trip, makes the required roll so impossibly high, just to piss Vin off.  So then Vin flips the table over and dismembers said nerd.  Discuss.

      So, instead of watching what seemed like a great hockey game, I was duped into seeing "the funniest Filipino on the planet".  Dear God!  If he's the funniest, then Filipinos are in trouble.  This guy sucked.  I didn't laugh once.  He had no idea how to deliver a proper joke.  Despite his utter suckage, the crowd was eating it up.  I guess cuz they were all Filipino themselves.  Oh my God.  I want my $20 back.  I feel very ripped off.  Afterwards, we were loitering at McDonald's when this French guy from Sorel hears us speaking English and proceeds to have a 2 hour conversation with us about why we're speaking English in a French province.  He seemed like an ok guy, but his complete cluelessness was shocking.  He couldn't understand why it's good to know more than one language.  Let's see him speak English as well as we speak French.  Anyway, long story short, he was but a microcosm of the mentality of many Quebecois, mostly outside the multicultural Montreal region: close-minded but not aware of it.

      So yesterday was grad day....under a giant tent...under the pouring rain.  After dreadfully boring speeches, we finally walked across stage and got our diplomae.  But walking through the rain all day had my feet swimming in my shoes.  VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  I hate wet shoes.  Made for a miserable day.  Then, the reception was in the lobby of a tiny building, where anyone was invited.  Imagine hundreds of people in a place the size of maybe 4 standard classrooms...with only carrots to eat.  I hate you, McGill.  You will never see another dollar of mine.

      So this weekend, I took in 2 Just For Laughs shows.  One was a series of short comedy films.  Pretty funny.  Way too much to discuss in this space, but trust me, some stuff was good.  Others were not so good, which seriously has me thinking I should make a short film and submit it to a festival.  Anyway, the second show was the superb Best of Uptown Comics.  It's basically a parade of black stand-ups, coming on stage in succession, with host  urlLink Orlando Jones  making jokes in between.  Orlando was great.  Special guest  urlLink Sinbad  was great.  The lone white comedian was great.  And the last guy, Earthquake, was damned funny, too.  In fact, the entire show was SOLID.  I'm hoping to go back next year.  Fun fact: Orlando Jones went to McGill briefly.  Check this  urlLink link  where he mentions it.

      So I went to pick up my pictures from Pharmaprix and I whip out a twenty, thinking it's gonna cost around $7.  But the girl says "$1.14".  I was shocked.  I gave my money and left.  Why so cheap?  Was it because I flossed the other girl last week and it was her way of thanking me?  I seriously cannot explain it.

      Another reason to hate cigarettes. I was walking by the little cafe they set up by the autoparc and some girl sitting in a chair on the 'terrace' flicks a cigarette behind her, grazing my arm.  I stood, shocked, then glowered at her.  She had this look on her face like she was scared to death of what I might do.  Instead of yelling at her for almost setting my arm on fire, I walked away.  Does that make me the bigger person or is it just another instance of conflict evading?  I should have yelled at her good.

      So I tried my hand at flossin' over-the-counter ladies again.  I dropped off film at Pharmaprix.  There was a choice between "quality" and "high quality".  Even though the signs explained the differences, I asked the girl what the diff was.  She giggled and explained.  Then she asked me to write my name.  I asked whether I should write first or last name.  She said she likes to put her first name.  At this point, I should have asked what her name was (turns out it was Lita, I found out later).  Anyway, I didn't ask.  So then I asked if I can come see her tomorrow to get the film.  She laughed and said it'll be ready in 2 days so she wouldn't be there.  We said bye and I left.  Still got it...  So at work, I finally have something to do.  Sure it's monkey-work, but at least the day passes quicker. So the other day, Ken Martin asks me if I can be a reference for his passport application.  I say sure.  The next day this morose-sounding lady calls. "Hi, I'm calling fromt he passport office.  Ken Martin listed you as a reference."" "Ok." "Can you describe him?"  "Uh, sure.  He has dark hair.  And he's half-Japanese." "Thank you." Click! Too funny.

      So we went to Ottawa on Wednesday night (thanks to Allison for driving me back and forth) and I met up with Joe at his apartment.  Dave, Jean and Mo showed up a bit later and then all sorta of fun was had.  If you wanna see pics,  urlLink here 's a site I made.  Anyway, I must say this, though.  Ontario is ultra lame.  No matter how old you look, everybody cards you.  Everybody.  Without any exception.  This 30ish chick was outside a bar crying cuz it was her birthday and she forgot her ID, so the entire night was ruined (cuz she couldn't get into any bars).  So sad.  Glad to be from Quebec.

      Well, the Weather Pixie is back!  Huzzah!  Thursday night was the Wilco concert at Theatre St-Denis.  While there were many empty seats, the show did not disappoint.  This is the third time i've seen them play and they're always rocking.  I even took some lengthy videos with my camera so I could watch/listen to my heart's content.  My job is ending soon.  Less than 2 weeks.  Sigh...what to do?  Anyone want to hire a computer engineer with no experience?  Please?
