       "i'm sorry i love you please take me" ordeal. I mean like, why be fake? It makes me wonder, I feel used. Again. I feel that I've been taken advantage of. Again. But, like Kailey said, And I'll never forget. Whats there to take advantage of? I don't get people. And people don't get me. I don't understand how people can say sorry to you, but you know, sorry wont always cut it. theres a certain number of times that you can use it, for the person to realize that your bullshitting them.   As I was saying, when people say sorry, do they actually mean it? I want to see some statistics or something, cause man, today was horrible. I despise people. a lot actually. I don't know what to believe anymore, I don't know what to think anymore, people are there bullshit lies, people in general. fuck society, fuck friendships. i don't see the point. honestly. i think i have about two friends, who would do anything for me, IF that. so long folks.     i don't think i'll ever do anything for anyone, ever again.

       a song by a band brazil. you should check them out. there good.    &nbsp;  well, i think i can sort of start my whole "plan" or "goal" or whatever. I really want to become friends with Rachel, and Paul, and some of her friends, and most of all Vanessa, they seem like very cool people, the types that don't talk crap on anyone, and stuff. I think it's kind of lame, how people are so judgemental now a days i will just leave it at this.

       Are all or most gay guys mean ? One of my old real good friends, Ryan, is gay now, and he's the biggest jerk ever. It's kind of sad really, is being gay a new fasion, and inorder to be gay you have to be stuck up? Weird. Well I took a walk tonight, listening to melo music, walking at a good decent pace, devouring the air. It was a nice walk. I think I might do this everynight. As I was walking, I was remembering how much before I wasnt a happy person, always bitter around the same people, a loser, a jerk, an asshole. And now, I think that with me kind of changing, I'm starting to be a nicer person, It's weird, cause like I never was this way, I used to be a very, very, very shy person, I still am, but not as much as before. You could ask anyone, I was shy, and kept things to myself, all the time. I still am like that, but not really . And If I do change, everything about me, I hope people will understand, cause this is how I am happy. I like going to shows and seeing all the "scene" kids, and then there is someone who usaually doesnt fit in. Thats me. I just hope that there are at least 5 people or even 4 people who will accept me, and want to hang around with me. Cause I know already that Junior year, will not be as good as I would expect it to be . Hey, but if all goes wrong, theres always that  other  alternative . Can you guess what that is ?

       walked into a department store, and saw people that you wish you could take into a secret place, and fuck there brains out, kiss there lips, touch there legs? well thats how i felt today. i hate it that i am fat, and totally unattractive, i really do want facial surgery or something , cause i hate myself. i feel like im not  good enough  for anyone, and it just sucks. as i walked through ikea , i was secretly stalking my prey, and checking them out, from head to toe. as i approached the line to check out the items, i noticed how everyone was looking at this one man. this man was well, different. it wasnt really a man, it was a wo man . i couldnt help but stare for about twenty seconds. i've always wondered what i would look like twenty pounds less then what i weight right now.&nbsp;i hope to become skinnier before school, and have nice clothing before school.

       when people are telling you to join there "crew" or make a "scene" with them. i find it stupid. i mean like, if your going to start something, then bring yourself in, and do it yourself, be original. don't bring other people in it. thanks.

       that someone says that there your friend, and you expect that a good friend would tell you something am i right ? well i think people are really fake. today, i asked trent how come he told everyone, except jef, that he went to palm springs. but he really went to volleyball camp. i find it extremely lame, that he told jef, but not us. and if anyone knew, jef has like the biggest mouth ever, you can't really tell him shit, without the whole world knowing the next day . but as i was saying, he told jef, not us, and about 3 weeks ago, trent had the biggest thing against jef, but after trent saw my livejournal about what jef, tariq, jared, and i did when we hung out, he started to be extra nice to jef, and i think it's kind of low, cause trent was talking all of this crap on him before, and jef just lets it be okay. which i think is crap. but whatever, there are many fake people in this world, and i'm just starting to realize it. you make start to think that i'm fake, and since this is the internet and all and theres not security, whatsoever. well i will leave myself thinking tonight before i sleep in my bed. 'never, ever believe someone, unless you know they can be trusted, even though, that trust, can always be broken, so just be aware .'

       i think i'm going to blog in here for a bit. I like my little layout on here, it's pretty. so I am going away with this livejournal stuff for just a bit. today, as i was walking down the street by the store the call bestbuy. i noticed how elegant the trees looked, and how i would like to be one of them to. the lady in the cd isle wasnt much help. it makes me wonder what this day and age is coming to, with the lack of basiclly everything. does everyone remember bagel bites ? i remember how good thoes tasted when i warmed them up for two minutes, and forty seconds. now that same taste that i used to adore, isnt there anymore. it's kind of like what my dad said to my sister when i was evesdropping on there conversation. he said that the lack of quality is everywhere, even in food. and i would have to agree. i feel the fan on me, it feels nice. sometimes i wish i was a piece of dust, and i could just fly away. on the freeway, there were tiny men in orange suits fighting a bush fire. i don't know why would there be so many people there, to fight a little fire, on a bush. it was quite funny. i think i saw someone almost fall from the cliff. well i must go now. i'm about to depart and go to sounds like. the cd store, to see if they have this dvd that i am eagerly searching for. my quest begins today. my plan begins tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;

       so yeah, today has been okay. Sister came out, and we did the room. well my brothers room, since mine is already quite done. well i hate my aunt. shes so annoying. i hate her. i wish she would just leave this house. Jef is being weird around his cousin. I've never seen him act this way before. I feel like a zombie. Ruining my life, just sitting here, and listening to music. I need a job. Badly. I think I'm going to start my quest on looking for a job pretty soon, maybe after summer school. thats if I don't drop out. Well I hate myself. I wish I looked like some people on myspace, there so pretty, and I'm yeah. Well goodbye.     -jay

        hello all, today was okay. i think it could of been better. i hate how everyone is always constantly mad at me. i mean, i don't get it. . . i really hate it, makes me depressed. well i hope no one really reads this, because this is suppose to be a special " private " blog. i have a  plan . it's to meet all the awesome scenesters on myspace, that i have added to my friends list. and become really good friends with them. they seem like very nice people. and they seem like there the type to not judge you, unlike some of the people who i hang around with recently. and if my friends can't handle the fact that i am changing. i'm sorry, but there really not my friends then. well this is my private journal, which will only be updated everytime i have something very hard to write in my livejournal. much love.

       isnt there always that strange feeling that you get when you know someone is gone forever, but you feel there prescence in a room near you? or, when your on a late night walk, listening to some tunes on your broken down cd player, and all of a sudden, you think of a special holiday or something special that occured in your life, because of something in the air, or maybe your mind is just playing tricks on you? Eaither way, it's quite pleasant.
