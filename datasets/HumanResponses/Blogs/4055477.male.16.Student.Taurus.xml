      --Ok, So since i've moved back from Georgia i've lost quite a bit of weight( 50-60lbs ).. Now that i'm down to a lower weight, I guess it's time to work on the gut and muscles...  This has nothing to do with what Tiffany said... Bitch... :: LOL j/k ::  ( No, in a way it does, but I  feel the same way.. ) Time to loose the Man-Boobs ( Moobs.. ) and start packin pecks..  --Now, i'm in no hurry, I just wanna get goin.. I mean, think of it this way:  "I dont do much outside of sitting around and working.."  I'll be all "Swole"... (Rofl..)  Next..  So, I got my login name &  i'm all set to start my online courses for college.. ( Of course they start a day earlier than school does...  ) For some reason I wanna go back to school..  No.. i'm lyin..  Ha..  Guess I'm workin 5-9pm tomorrow too.. (no prob, more hours = more tax taken out)  wait.. ok, nvm..  (no, its otay.. I wike workin in tewls..)    Done..

       - - So, I finally gave in and told Logan I was gay.. (I dunno, somehow i thought I was gonna just skip that little part about me  for the next, ever .. considering how many guy friends i've lost in the past.. ) He was really cool about it.. makes me happy that someone gets it (even if its just alittle..)  -Anyways, he was supportive and I liked that when I told him, he didnt just let the window blink and watch in awe as I basically slit myself open and spilled my guts onto the table..  I mightve just made a friend today..   - -Right now i'm goin through drama in other areas that I dont wanna worsen, but i'll just say that it was all my fault..  Also, if i wasnt a passivist i'd kick someones ass right now .. (Bitch..)  I gotta let go of the issues and buckle down..  7  days until the end of the world.. (i'm goin to  hell )..  ttyl.. (Talk to you later..)

        - - You can already guess that the party was great.. we ate, talk, laughed and beat the hell outta each other.. (through all of that I think i ingested about an ounce of shaving cream) ..

       - - How is my job going to have a sale today where you get an extra 10% off of your already 20% clothing discount THE WEEK YOU DONT GET PAID!??!?? I was trying to buy some more school clothes and stuff but theres no money that I really have to spend.. We'll just see what 40 dollars can get with a 30% discount on clothes already marked 50% on sale..  - I need polo shirts.. and t-shirts.. maybe some of those CRB tee's I saw for 7.96... (sorry, i'm just thinkin out loud.. typing*)  So, I work at 12:30 till 4:30, so i'll prolly find somethin I like and put in on hold till I get back up there at six.. I'll go bug somebody like  LoGan  or  JeSsIcA .. BTW I havent seen  JiLl  in a while.. Anyways.. (It'd be cool if we all went to the movies or somethin.. theyre all pretty cool ppl.. Fun fun.. Besides I need more friends.)  I guess I'll be stayin at my cousins house b/c I have no way of getting to the party otherwise.. (it's starts at 4:30)  No licsencse yet..

        - - Today was a big difference in our house.. (We all actually got along..)   For a while atleast  ..     - I spent the day out with the fam-fam (*family..) Didnt do anything too special.. Grocery shopping (which took up the day)... Sometimes it amazes me how much we can fit in the trunk of a little 04' sonata..      --It felt good being around everyone again without someone on the phone, out clubbin, or too moody to have a decent conversation with.. We got to do some of the old things again.. ( paging eachothers name over the loudpeaker, throwing frozen carrots... Fun fun..) Even my little nephew got in on the action..    K, maybe I dont have the most normal of families, but I still love 'em..

       - - So, I guess next week will be my last full week of summer break (thanx for the update LoGan!.. Grr.. ) This morning I spent most of my day lookin up buddy icons and listening to music. (So, you can tell i've been really busy this summer..)  " ... ... ... "   - I didnt get to float today so I spent my day at work up in my little cage in kids.. (They really call it a cashwrap but they can go  f***  themselves b/c it's not..) I Feel like a hamster in that damn thing.. ( walk to one side, turn around, walk to the other side.. so on.. so on.. )  And they wonder why I count my registers down five minutes after I get there ( So I can get the hell out! )  - - Do you ever feel like your "fake" when your at work? Sometimes I just wonder what I would really say if they werent paying me to stand in the cage (sorry, "cashwrap" ...)   What I say now:    Customer:  Well, The sign says it's 30% off and if you dont give it to me than i'll never shop here again.  Me:  Mam, i'm soo sorry. I'll call someone over to go re-check the price for you. Sorry for the inconveniece (3 Minutes later) Have a nice day! (b**** walks away with the 30% off..)   What I would say if the pay was too low...    Customer:  Hi, could someone help me over here!  Me:   (standing in opposite corner) " ... ... ..."  Customer:  Excuse me, young man! .... ok, let me speak to your manager  Me:  (slowly walk towards the woman) "... ... ...." (bitch slaps her and her children)  Customer:  My Lord! I'll never shop here again.. (holds face where big red hand mark is..)  Me:  (back in the corner now..) (tilts head, shrugs, smirks, and laughs..) (gets ready to bitch slap her again..)  Customer:  (runs away..)  Bitch-Ass Customers...  (lol)  (Ok, maybe i'm not really  that  mean.. but its nice to think about..)  Anywayz i'm goin to go look at cars to buy tomorrow.. Then I got that party on monday and I was goin to geauga lake but not anymore.. But then again, there's always room to shop.. (I love blowing that  chump change  I get from sears..)

        - So, Today I was a floater at my job. Yay! (Just so we get somethin straight, a floater at Sears is not the kind your thinkin about.. I give all of the associates their breaks and close registers..  Sicko..  )    - -But anyways, it's so nice that I dont have to be in one little box for 4 hours straight.. (I get to be in different little boxes,  so there!..  )    ..There's an increase in shoplifting lately.. It's embarrassing b/c most of the ppl who live in my apartments across the street are the shoplifters! (I still dont understand what a person would do with $300 in sears giftcards except buy gifts for their grandparents..)  Stupid ppl..    Whatchu talkin bout willis?  (Sorry, I just wanted to say that..)  Thats basically it for today... I got a party to go to on Monday so that'll be fun (Me being the only sober one and all..)

       - - So, I figured that I'd start this other journal so absolutely anyone can see what my life is like without all of the details.. I know it sounds funny but then again, you haven't seen my actual journal  have you?  Anyways..  - Lots of things goin on in my life that are a little "stressful" to say the least.. (living the suburban life is hard..  i swear it is! )  Hopefully this year will start out new b/c moving to Ohio in December was about the  worst decision my mom ever made . I'll try to make some new friends and not be the guy who speeds to class b/c there's nobody to talk to in the hallway.. ( I'm pretty sure that one day my pants caught flame.. No, seriously.. )
