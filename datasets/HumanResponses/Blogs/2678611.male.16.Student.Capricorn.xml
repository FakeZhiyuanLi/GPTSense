      If you follow the path you must not follow the path itself, but rather, follow your goal, because if you focus on the path and not your ultimate goal, you may fall astray and turn back.    You can make yourself believe anything. If you want to hate someone you can, if you want to love someone you can. It's actually a very simple concept, its how people fool lie detectors, all you have to do is believe the lie. So if you can believe a lie, then you can believe a feeling, maybe thats how people in the middle ages learned to love the spouse they were forced to marry, either that or they hated them and eventually murdered them in their sleep...one of the two.

      Word plays get you vanished Like a shadow in the day, demolished Another skull to add to my collection Another life intersected like a contradiction Off the chain, Delivered to your brain Drove a man mentally insane Chewin' myself out the straight jacket 180 degrees fall accross the wratchet 6 AM off to go break another back Pull 9-5 without an ounce of respect Every day I do my best to chill Everytime tryin to find another cheap thrill I could use a little more structure in my life Check all the possible prospects not pertaining strife Tryin' not follow everything along the same circuit Doin' the best not to become another name in the obituaries Spread across the page flows the deepest of my brain quaries Too many people willing to risk their soul for solom vindication Willing to spend a 2-week spoil on premeditated medication I'm straight forward with the words, just letting you know Too many two-faced people are they friend or foe Just keep your gun cocked up Fuck around though and find your bitch knocked up Keep callin me cuzzin and find your chin bone buzzin I aint a nice person, your head is about to be waht im submersin Pull the chrome out, too late, im pullin ur spine out

      Oh shit!  On the news some kid from my school was booted out cuz he had a hit list with like 10 dudes and some teachers, and shit about how he was gonna kill them and then kill himself, fuckin Columbine wannabes, shit, what the fucks wrong with people. Then i started thinkin', was I on that list? Nahh, prolly not, dude was 17, makin him a junior, or a pretty stupid sopohomore, so i was most likely NOT on the list, they didnt say who that kid was though, and I wanted to find out when I went to school today, but im sittin at home cuz my fucking ride is 2 stupid to give me a call to see if im on time, they stupid fucker always leaves late to begin with, an extra minute isnt going to fuck up his schedule, god damn, he forgot me yesterday 2.  I also watched that vid of the dude gettin his head cut off, on the time stamps 11 hours lapse over the whole thing, one time lapse was inbetween when they assaulted him, and cut his head off, so i was wonderin what the hell kinda fucked up shit they were doin do that dude in god knows how much time, i'm going to just assume anally raped. I also noticed dead peoples faces look really weird, really creepy, but before i get TOO sadistic lets move on.  My mom gave me an extra 10 bucks this morning, i dont know why, but she did, so thaz cool, maybe ill go buy a CD or something with my other money OR!!! ill put it in my fund to get my Klipsch 5.1 Ultra speaker system for my comp, after i get that i wanna get another 2 extra subs i can link up 2 it, so it will have the dual side firing subs, and then 2 extra 8 inch subs, 100 watts a piece, my current 6-inch sub is enuf to make parts of the house rattle, so i figure with my next set up ill be shakin shit off the walls.    Sometimes i just wanna grab somebody by their hair and start punching the crap out of their face, i figure before they can fight back ill have 6 good hits to their nose. at that point they might be in a state of shock allowing me to smash em the eyes 2. Dont ask.  I started a new book, its BAD ASS, yeah thats right, books can be cool 2 you mudda puckers. It's The Face by Dean Koontz. I haven't gotten very far, but its about this ex LAPD cop workin for the biggest dude in hollywood as a security manager or something, and some dude has been like sending in 'disturbing' packages, and the dude is all tryin to solve the puzzle. Except so far its been being solved really fast and theres like 350 pages left so i figure the plot will thicken.  Indeed it shall.  Who said that?  I'm listening to Atmosphere, i've been listening to that a lot lately, Slug is a bad ass rapper and he generally has pretty good beats layed on his trax. oh yeh that reminds me I burned a copy of Aesop Rock - Labor Days for my russian teacher Mr. Plichta, he asked me 2 so i figured why not, I doubt he will like it though, oh well, doesnt hurt anything.  Also in russian we were discussing about how people need to be able to share their opinions freely, cuz fuckin Kim got pissed at mr. mac for saying there was no god and only science so she and her uppity bitch friends met for discussion after school, fuckin bitches like that get me pissed, who gives a flying fuck what somebody said, especially in science class, by a FUCKING SCIENCE TEACHER, what the hell do you think hez going to say? get real you stupid fuckers, i swear to god, people are so ignorant, its like they are appauled that somebodys opinion conflicts their one so throw a fit.  Who lit the fuse on your fuckin tampon?  good god people, seriosuly, lighten up  now if he was inforcing his beliefs and saying that his way was right, thats a whole nother story, but thats not what happened, atleast to my knowlege.  Oh yeah i was watching a news video about the raising gas prices and it informed me well. there is no shortage of gas, the prices ballooned cuz the demand on wholesale is so high they cant keep up with production so they jack their prices causing the other prices to soar also. And compared to inflation, this what our grandparents payed in the 1950s. (think ratios you stupid fuckers)

      Ok so where was I, yelling cynthias name to no avail right?? ok anyways.....  I fumbled my way through the endless sheets of rain, and soaked ground, trying to get my ass out of here. I figure I'll head back to the car and wait out the storm and that's where I will probably be the safest, except I didn't remember which way I came from, any foot prints I had layed were wased away 5 steps back.  What was that? I could've sworn I saw Cynthias figure running in the distance, I took running off after her, yelling her name, every few minutes I would catch a glimpse of her, never being able to reach her. I thought the rain was drowing out my voice which would explain how she didn't hear me.  (i really dont feel like finishing this story)  I felt like I was running accorss something hard and I looked down to notice I was running accross the road once again, I looked down at at it, and turned around to see a car flying at me, breaks screeaching, it swereved and fish tailed, the rear end of the car collided with me, launching me back.    I woke up 3 days later in the hospital.  ~Fin     Bitches

      Since when did love for a night in a hotel room cost 5 dollars?  Since when did mexicans name their kids Jesus?  What's with all these kids ridding 22s?  Why the fuck do people do crack?  Where the fuck is Osama Bin Hatin?  Why the fuck is everybody so negative?  "This is gau, that sucks, i'm better than you cuz you suck so bad, everything is shit, you arent shit, go to hell, everything stinks" Ya know what? Fuck you and fuck off, nobody wants to listen to a baby whine all day long, unless ur name is michael.  Why the fuck do people think i wear expensive clothing? Its not my fucking fault they're poor! good god!  Why the fuck is everybody so fucking uptight?! i manage to live without being uptight, why cant they!?  Why do people talk about how they would only date hot chicks and shit, when they always have to talk to the biggest losers of chicks who are ugly as fuck?!?! dont be so fuckin picky, you stupid retards are going to be virigins forever, and paying for it doesnt count!  thats enuf ranting for tonight  *takes a deep breath*

      I stepped of the train at about 9 o'clock at night, the ride was what should be expected from any train ride, fairly calm with no interuptions, it wasn't a full a train and i didnt have to sit next to anyone, i pittered about on my laptop for most of the duration.  My ridr was late like always, I was expecting my brother Ryan to pick me up, i was expecting him to be late, so all was on time. I noticed a man drinking tea and feeding his dog a cookie, this intrigued me for some reason. Checking my watch i notice Ryan is later then usual so i figure id give him a call, right when im about to call him i see his car pull up, his wife is driving, he explains Ryan was too busy to come pick me up so she had to come instead. It was another 2 hours before we got to where we were headed, I watched out along the cold landscape, as it passed me by. Cynthia (ryans wife) and I make little conversation on the ride home, a gentle rain starts hitting against the windshield.  As we put miles behind us the rain is picking up, the visibilty worsens and the night is turning into a spiraling staircase of rain drops and windy hell. I never liked the way Cynthia drove, keeping her consistant 80 mph as we barreled down the narrow highway, only about another hour to go.  This type of weather was uncustomary to this dry terrain. A coyote darts accross the highway barely missing us, we serve out of its way and back into our lane, Cynthia looks at me, close one huh? Her distraction leads to something more unpleasant as we hit a section of washed out road at 80 miles per hour, the car veers to the left sharply and it flips off the road. I woke up with the most god awful head ache ive ever experienced in my life, and im laying in about 5 inches of water.   I go to check on Cynthia and she's no where to be seen, I crawl out of the wrecked car and call for her, we mustve been thrown for about 300 feet off the road because I can't even see the highway anymore, and my cell phone is ruined from all the water.  I find disturbed earth, or atleast what i think is disturbed earth, its still raining, and im having a hard time finding where the car impacted along the ground, and i feel highly disoriented, i touch the sore spot on my head and check my hand to see that im bleeding a good amount. I call cynthias name to no avail and i start to become very worried...  Would you like to know what happens next?  Then stay updated on my blog, I may post again tonight.

      nah i wish i could write something like that, couldnt shoot close if i arced it at the sky.  if u want to know any other good hip hop u can contact me on aim: icewatterr    hip hop is all about the real stuff in day to day life, how many people can relate to ferarri enzos and enuf gold to be called Midas?  new rappers like 50 cent and lil jon cant rhyme and they wont battle the tight mc's because they are still being challenged by reading, so why rap when they can sweat over a good paperback  if u go into a chat room geared twords hip hop ull prolly find a bunch of kids 'batteling'; their rhymes consist of the stereotypical shooting up bitches and 'that gangsta shit', sad isnt it?  Talib Kweli - Good Mourning  "Good morning, Brook-nam" Another stop... on the train (wake up... wake up... wake up...) We come to a stop that everybody got to make...  Whether you local or express  [Talib Kweli] What's the meanin of ghettofabulous Not ridin the back of the bus I'm a revolutionary antagonist Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen  at once; still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go They come back as tales of niggas we used to know Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out like respect and fade out like TV sets into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you  [Hook: Talib Kweli] Good mourning, good afternoon, good night What have you done with your life? Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man I'm puttin up a hellafied fight {*Hi Tek scratch: "Stay awake to the ways of the world"*}  [Talib Kweli] I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+ Who said, "Just because no one can understand how you speak don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep" In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered  [Hook: Talib Kweli] Good mourning, good afternoon, good night What have you done with your life? Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man I'm puttin up a hellafied fight {*Hi Tek scratch: "Stay awake to the ways of the world"*}  [Talib Kweli] Yo, the time come for everybody.. It ain't somethin you can really prepare for  Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and Grover Washington, rock rock on and My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and Big L, rock rock on and Freaky Tah rock rock on and Jerome Green, rock rock on and Slang Ton, rock rock on and We celebrate life.. {*echoes*}   ^ thats that straight real shit, no talk about spinners and fuckin bitches in a club.   more lif and ak greatness  Inhuman Capabilities Lyrics by Akrobatik  feat. Mr.Lif   Akrobatik [Mr.Lif in brackets] Akrobatik brings the closest thing to lyrical perfection When I extent my tecs send spiritual conections Never catch me lounging in the ignorant section Kill emcees for my profession, with the lyrical [invection?] injection [Does akrobatik burn?] No question! I'm vexed trends got ladies drooling over the next men But I flex pens and bench-press thoughts to build my strength Cuz the battle will be long and I plan to go the length You can search latitude and longitude and never find a stronger dude My attitudes define emcees to prey on for food My minds like hannibal lectur's Cuz when it comes to eating niggas up I give cannibals lectures [It's time to peep some artists of a different texture] Uplifting the motivated, mentally slaying the extras [They look gorgous as soon as rigor mortis sets in. This is when Lif steps in. Just in time to bust another lyrical headspin. and windmill... Hes been ill. since way back! He came into the studio laid back Then he proceded to blaze a hole in your track Hurry up and get sum medical aid, the beat starting to fade This dj's cutting you on a blade And if you reach for the board your fingers sliced the niggas nice. You got caught up in a lyrical heist And got physically diced You can try to splice him back together] Will he be the same? [Never]  -scratching- Inhuman capabilites Is the god human Inhuman capabilities We the inhuman  Yo! We stand miles above ur highest point 93 million styles above ur flyest joint  Welcome to the brain you about to get the grand tour Bringing rappers to they demise like Gigantor Speaking of demises me and Lif about to plan yours The incompetent we stomping them at the damn door [Cuz he'll never comprehend what we stand for We'll f**k up your Air Force and start up a land war. Running down the line A to Z like transor Go the whole line like 5 and 4 Combined after the poeple signed I heard the people find me...to be...mad shockin when im rocking Check how our voices are] Interlocking! [To crush the mental toxin, thats poisening] You and yuor offspring [So were launching] Bombs! [In fact, a full scale f**king attack] On anything wack [Ak hold back] Naw never that! [I'll sever that thought completely] You are now getting sleepy [Hypnosis] Submerged [I'm under] Implant elements [Lightening] Thunder [I'm surfacing] Prepare to [Start murdering those verballize but really aint wise Give them several tries they still meet they demise Ak and Lif defy] Aries [Large] Got everything you need [Hammers] Claws [Stitches] Bars [Flamethrowers and saws] Lif and Akrobatik always blowing the spot [Cuz we do the type of shit the average human cannot] Span the globe on foot [In a day an a half] Go back in time and tell Confucious that [He don't know the math] Control the elements like a male X-man Storm with a staff Navigate the 7 seas on a white water raft Confiscate all your rounds even before you pull your gun out [Put some spit on your index finger] And put the sun out!    duo artist compilations like that kick serious ass, just like Cannibal Ox  http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Cannibal-Ox/
