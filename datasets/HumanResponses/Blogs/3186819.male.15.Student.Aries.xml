      Its a typical day in my neighbourhood, an annoyingly disgusting day in my neighbourhood. I get home today, expect to go out with mother and I wait. And wait. When she comes home she already got the things we were getting, but with JEFF. DAMN I AM REALLY STARTING TO DISLIKE THAT MAN! So I thought I was gonna decorate me bedroom tonight. WRONG. All items must first be approved by El President...i mean Comrade...i mean Fidel... I MEAN MOTHER. So congratulations boring life. Damn I can't wait until I see my pschyatrist!

      So yeah, how stupid are things in my life? I thought I would wake up, have a nice coffee, have my shower, and be ready. But no. Some bitch (aka my mom) used my computer super early and somehow DISABLED my alarm, because she stole my alarm clock. Why? Because sho so BRILLIANTLY spilled water on hers. So anyways. I go to have a shower, and my sister Queen Bitchala, Queen of Slutty Whores bolts into the bathroom as soon as I say I'm having a shower. And then, what does my mom do? SHE YELLS AT ME FOR GETTING ANGRY AT HER! "You've been yelling the past couple of days" she says. So I replied "Maybe thats because you won't get off my f***ing  back, because heaven forbid Brit gets a little less. because she is such a bitch she gets everything" and then she yells again to stop yelling, when I was only speaking loud enough to go over the noise of the seemingly extra loud, very water hoggish shower. So now I can't bloody have my coffee, because mom and her boyfriend USED THE MILK I PUT A NOTE ON SAYING PLEASE DO NOT DRINK. She treat him so much better then she treats me. She'll offer if we're out to buy him a coffee, but will deny me a coffee. Last night I asked to go along on the ride with them, even though it wasn't anything big. She flat out says No, because she had a hard day and wants to go alone. AND THEN SHE TURNS AROUND AND ASKS JEFF (her deaf b/f) TO GO, EVEN THOUGH I AM DIRECTLY AROUND HER. Damn I am pissed off.

      Oh what a strange cruel life we lead. As friendships pass and people float downstream, you start to wonder, why am I telling people the ship is sinking and watch them jump off the plank when in fact it is floating better than ever? Noone can ever predict exactly what is going to happen to them in the future. Noone can acuratly portray their life. The human brain becomes clouded with time and it is aggrevated with life. Titles are placed on you and you place titles on people, barely noticing it. What people fail to recognize is that titles themself are a problem. What is the big deal if you are a "best" friend. Why rank people. What will that accomplish other than insult the lower ranked people and overinflate the ego of the people you rank high. It doesn't matter what the fuck happens in life, it invariably scews up one way or another. As franicked ship members become nothing but flotsam and jetsam, you really start to wonder "Could I have prevented this". And you know that if you hadn't yelled the ship is sinking everyone overboard, the mess would be gone. Why is life so full of these fickle little things? Some trace it back and blame it on the serpent in the Garden of Eden deciving Eve and bringing evil into the world. Some blame it on so-called "Luck". Some just say they are having a bad day. If that holds true then I guess I've been having a bad life? And then on top of that the constant blur that is friendship. Some people guilt you into saying something, even if you say that you don't know what to say. The constant ins and outs of life are stressing and are pissing me off. I caught myself on the phone saying "I hate my life. Hey look there is a bottle of tylenol on my desk, how many are in the bottle" and then I proceeded to opening the bottle! Thank goodness the party on the other end informed me of what I was doing and stopped me. After ending a friendship your emotions are left raw and bloody, like a scraped knee. It leaves you vulnerable, and when friends start fighting right then and there, you feel powerless and lost. You wonder why people care so much about friendships. Theres a million and a half things you would love to yell in your friends face, but heaven forbid they ever hear it let alone you lose them. If I lost my friends I would of lost the best treasure I have. But why are friends so necessary. On MSN during three way conversations, are the other two parties talking about me behind my back? When you get a phone call, is there another person on the line, making the person who recieved the call a victim? This life is so full of twists and turns why do I live it. Why do I continue to live my life. Up until today I had a very good answer which prevented me from thinking further into why and if my life should be continued. The old answer is replaced by this new one. If I die, I lose the best people I have ever known in my life. My Friends. Especially T.T. and M.C. (as of 05/04 This no longer applies :) And why would I put them through the most tramautic thing that can happen (or one of the worst). That would be selfish and idiotic. My mother would just die if I did. And my friends would be so hurt it would make me so angry. So why do I continue living? So that I can be with them now instead of later.

      Is it just me, or are we constantly bombarded with the advertisments of Stuff by Duff. Its on almost every channel, and it has the same song. Stuff by Duff are disgusting-looking clothes and accessories aimed towards the "tween" phenomenom and are supposedly for up to 16 years (aee http://www.stuffbyduff.ca). I am sick of them. "My stuff is now at Zellers" is constantly spoken, filling the void that was left by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Its annoying! Stuff By Duff is everywhere advertised and it is driving me crazy. So this Stuff, apparantly by Duff (probably she never saw the clothing before production) is at Zellers.........

      look Julie, Robert is a good friend of mine and you're a little anti-commitment b*tch. You know, It must of taken truck fulls of courage to ask you out and you "dump-him" before you've even gone out? What the h*ll? If you don't want to go out with someone don't but don't pretend you do and then change your mind. All and all i've talked to Robert about what a girlfriend is (or boyfriend really) at our age. Clearly to any regular person in gr. 9 sex is not an issue so I'll leave that out of this. (I thought I'd acknowledge it to show that I'm aware and that I simply don't wish to bring that into things) General requirements for signifigant others: attractive *whatever that might be to you*, clearly likes you *so as to attempt to avoid rejection*, funny, potentially smart, has common ground with you, is able to keep up a conversation without awkward pauses. How many of these was Julie? right, none. But moving on in Rob and my discussion we brought up the fact that those things were pretty much how you define a best friend. It's true! This hole obsession with boyfriends and girlfriends is stupid because ultimately you're looking for a best friend, which many of us already have. Why do we pressure ourselves into giving these ppl who we care about titles? Maybe I'm missing something but If your requirements for a girlfriend or whatever are there already matched to someone, why ruin that by pressuring them into something they don't want to do? Leave it at that. When it happens it happens right? And then you can reevaluate what a girlfriend is.  Best of luck to you Julie, I'm sure guys love trying to go out with the girl who doesn't even give ppl a chance. "Let's just be friends?" right, that'd be a step up for you Hun,

      If you have never three, four, or even five way called before learn now! It is the most fun one can have in a nice or not so nice manner. For years it has been available but it seems as though it only becomes common knowledge once you enter high school. You can make it so that every one is aware of every one else on the line or some ppl can be "mute" so they can hear everything but the, well victim, doesn't know theyr'e there. Of corse i am somewhat scared that someone could do the same thing to me, sit there as a friend and ask me what i thought of other ppl while that person may be right there listening. I am a lousy liar but i do "edit" what I'm going to say and to whom I say it. Not really in a bad way, and I'm not changing what I say, I merely try to be tactful to the person I'm speaking with. The magic of "three waying" is that that guard can be down for one person making you soooo vulnerable to the others eagerly hanging off of each and every word you utter. It's fantastic. So, the moment you let your guard down to that friend who is oh so nice and thoughtful, maybe even crying with you, be aware. It's not what that thoughtful person has to say that matters, It's the silence that you should really be concerned about. -By Tanya

      It seems that no matter what I do, I can never please my mother. I could drop dead and she would criticize my form when dropping, the way I died, and then when the autopsy came back she would critize the cause of death and the way the coroner performed the autopsy! BLOODY FUCKING HELL there is no end to it for me. I go to cook supper and she says "noone wants a big meal". Am I noone, do I matter? Apparantly not. Neither does my sister it seems. She wants us to eat rice and potatoe skins and 1/2 of the meat we usually do? What the fuck does she think I am, her bitch? Then she barges in my room and I turn of the monitor, and she assumes I am looking at porn. Yes, because I just love porn *rolls eyes*. So she demands to see that it truly is a journal, so I flash the screen on and then off so she can see it is a journal but not the words. She then proceeds to barg in 4 more times. Bloody hell it is sickening. I wish I had some way of getting away from it all. Death is too permanent, to serious. Life is unbearable. A seperate vacation doesn't make fiscal sense. We cant even afford food! Its times like this I start to begrudge rich people, but then I remember theres a ryme and reason for this life. Maybe my reason was to be a support, but I can already feel the cracks forming on my sides and deep within. I am breaking slowly, and when I fall apart, God only knows what is going to happen. Will I die? Maybe. Will I MAKE myself die (you know what I mean)? I could, but probably won't. Will I be committed? Possibly. Will it be a breakdown? Certainly. Life isn't treating me right, so I am being rubbed the wrong way by my family. Its like my mom is treating us like her employees. Like it or not mother, I am only 15! I am ready for the real world, but want the innocence of my youth years. Damn I am sick of this. At this rate I will have a meltdown in 4 weeks. Percent complete to critical mass:40%.

      "For once a non-pesimistic post! Here is the story about the great night Tanya, Michael, and I had.  So it starts around noon. Tanya, Michael and I are all on MSN talking about her blog, and then michael has to go. So I mentioned that she was right, friends do need to make plans. So that cleverly planted hint got us scheming. First we were going to go to a carnival...Too expensive. So we settle for Roller Gardens. So I call tanya as soon as I find out the easy where there, Stonechurch Bus, is closed at 6. So she is on her cell on a bus trying to explain to me. So I decide to just catch an Upper Ottawa at Gore Park. So my mom picks me up at a bus stop and drives me to gore park to meet tanya and take the same bus together. So i wait, get on the bus, and then find out she caught an earlier one. So I arrive at Roller Gardens, and there is tanya. So we wait and 10 minutes later Michael shows up. So we proceed in, and Tanya rents inline skates. So we find a table, and an old aquaintence of tanya glides over. She brings a male over with her. So this guy starts talking to tanya and then they dance. During the dance he GROPES HER BUTTOCKS! So then they finish and he lays on her! So she excuses herself to go to the bathroom, and outside of it she converses with Michael and I. We start making plans to escape. Michael and I pretend to be sick and leave. We wait in the lobby, and she doesnt show up. So we talk to security. They cleared the dance floor so we could walk through, and then we talk to security some more. He ensures we get to the bus stop safely. Then we took the 22 Upper Gage Bus to Lloyd D. Jackson Square. We get to the Famous Players Cinema at around 10:40, and the last movie started at 10:30. So we arrive late and watch the movie which was a meant to be scary serious drama but ended up making me laugh. So after the movie Michael calls his mother and we wait. We see her drive by 3 times until she stops for us. Then we spent time laughing and talking in the car, desperatly trying to find Tanya's house. We do, and then I go home, and then I wrote this blog after taking my medication. The End. "

      The human mind is a miracle of creation. Everything in life, let alone the world, has an effect on it. It performs many functions of your body without you being able to stop them (such as regulating heart beat). Outside influences have reactions inside the body, and almost all of them initiate with the brain. So things that make us sad and depress out mood must have effects inside the brain and throughout your body. In this essay I will go into detail on the consequences outside insults, and even insults initiated to make fun of yourself, have on your body and mind.  	When someone is made to be the joke of a group, or are insulted, the body jumps into action. The person may become defensive, aggressive, and angry. The person may also become quiet, reserved, and chose to segregate themselves from the community. Why does this happen though? What causes these effects? It all can be traced back to the brain.  	When someone is afraid, upset, overjoyed or angry, the body sends a signal to the adrenal glands. The glands (located behind the kidneys) release epinephrine (e-p&-'ne-fr&n) (more commonly known as adrenaline). Epinephrine has an effect on almost all aspects of the body. When it is released, it creates many changes. The person can become aggressive and hyper. This is because epinephrine when released in high quantities (such as when offended) speeds up the conversion of glycogen into glucose, which provides extra energy to the muscles. If you’ve ever heard of a man overcoming insurmountable odds (such as being mauled by a bear) and succeeding (like killing the bear with his bare hands), that’s because of adrenaline. It causes you to tense muscles, and it increases your heart rate and respiration. Emotions, such as anxiety, irritability, sadness and depression, or extreme happiness and exhilaration come out. It also locks the bowel and urinary systems, to ensure no leakage during combat (an evolutionary or creational change).  	While the results of epinephrine seem to be an asset when being insulted, the long term effects of high levels of epinephrine can be damaging. It lowers the immune system, and can cause chronic fatigue syndrome.  	While epinephrine may be a major player in the whole system, it is not the only culprit. When constant put-downs and derogatory statements are put on a person, stress sets in. This isn’t the every day “oh my, not another test” kind of stress. This is the constant never ending beast kind of stress. With this kind of stress, illnesses and disorders can set in. In both women and men, it can cause clinical depression, bi-polar disorder (also known as manic depression), schizophrenia (these three especially from insult-oriented stress), acne, high blood pressure, obesity, glaucoma, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, irritability, stress headaches, dandruff, graying and balding hair, tremors, gastrointestinal problems, trust issues in relationships, and diabetes, among others. In men, it can cause impotence, low sperm count, infertility, pre-mature ejaculation and weak bladder. In women it can cause irregular menstruation, difference in volume of menstruation (heavier/lighter), and decreased fertility. All of this from a few simple, but mean words.  	Although stress can cause all of these, why? What is it in stress that makes people essentially shut down? Just because someone called me “humongo” or “jumbo”, does that mean I am going to go insane and die? No. The human body has built in mechanisms for dealing with stress. But these mechanisms are not fail-proof. If the problem is not managed effectively, then you can get problems, and later in this paper I will discuss these methods.  Stress has four categories. The first is the “fight or flight” category, which is the where epinephrine is released. Next is the internal stress. This is where comments about yourself that you make stress you out, or other items that you are stressing over. Thirdly, there is environmental stress, which is stress caused by your surroundings and people making comments about you. Finally there is fatigue and overwork, which can pile up over time. When the body senses stress the hippocampus (the part of your brain that consolidates memories into a permanent store) pumps out a stress hormone, cortisol. However when constant stress is in place, it damaged the hippocampus, throwing cortisol levels out of whack, creating memory loss and you can start forgetting favorite memories, causing stress, which then releases more cortisol, in a vicious cycle.  No one wants these things to happen to them. But how do you deal with stress and bullying? What about insults? Bullies and insults can be stopped. If you are the one dishing insults out about yourself, STOP! If it is someone else, ask them to stop. If they refuse to stop, there is a simple 3 step technique you can try. Step one is to ignore it. When you ignore a bully, they do not get the attention that they so sorely need to feel power and control. If it continues, move on to step two, form allies and create a coalition against the source. No bully wants to stand up to a group of ten people who can be pumped full of adrenaline. And step three, Leave the situation. There is not point in staying where someone is going to insult you. Why is this technique successful in many cases? It is due to the base that all that bullies are looking for is attention. They want to feel the power and control over another human being. This is because they have a mental problem. This may be from family situations, anger in the home, and is most often a learned behavior (they see father abusing mother, believe it is the right way to treat people). If after trying many situations the bullying persists, you must tell a trusted adult and treat it as a criminal harassment case.  As well as stopping the source may go, you still have stress to deal with. There are many good ways of dealing with stress. A lot of times stress is caused by inadequate sleep. Try to get at least 8 hour (preferably 9-11 hours) of quality (undisturbed, uninterrupted, silent, dark) sleep. Dump nicotine, alcohol, drugs, and even caffeine like last year’s eggnog. Exercise. By exercising you can channel the stress you are feeling into physical motion, and burn that stress like a battery. Try classes such as yoga or Tai chi. All of these things can help relive stress.  Insults and derogatory humor are some of the lowest forms of communication. After being educated in these, their effects, and dealing with them, and person should be able to shake a problem. A major point that must be stressed is that it is never your fault you are being bullied, and NEVER bully yourself. For when one turns against themselves, they have nowhere to fall back.

"I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: no  Tanya Z says: come on? How impotant is spellllllink ? EHHH? michal miceal michael. It's all good  i need $600.00 says: im very particular  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: MSN uses something called "slang" and "short forms", its a sort of system used by most people, as to not have to type as much or seem like an perfectionist  Tanya Z says:   happy thoughts guys  i need $600.00 says:   these are happy  *rolling eyes smiley was here*  Tanya Z says: no they're not  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: who cares, tonya made a mistake its not the end of the world  i need $600.00 says: Tanya.......with an A  Tanya Z says: come on. lol not a big deal.  i need $600.00 says: la dee da dee doo    Tanya Z says: come on guys.   i need $600.00 says: *whistles uncomfortably*      Tanya Z has left the conversation.    i need $600.00 says: well i suppose the biggest reason we were friends at the beginning was a) we knew each other at cardinal and B) at the beginning we had similar beliefs  i need $600.00 says: but theres no reason trying without a mediator  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: is tonya coming back  i need $600.00 says: probably  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: did she tell u why she left  i need $600.00 says: nope  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: than she'll be back  i need $600.00 says: *once again whistles*      Tanya Z has been added to the conversation.    When did I eat that? says: well i suppose the biggest reason we were friends at the beginning was a) we knew each other at cardinal and B) at the beginning we had similar beliefs  When did I eat that? says: just to refresh everyones memory  When did I eat that? says: now I can continue my thought  When did I eat that? says: as time went on my beliefs matured and changed and the raport I had with Josh started to diminish. Then I decided I wanted out of the HSU leadership until I could handle it again, and when I did, the so-called and incorrectly named "hate-mail" became.  Tanya Z says: is this hatemail a large issue?  When did I eat that? says: for those of you who don't posses the knowledge to know what "rapport" means, it means the comfort and the being comfortable with each other to the point where the guard is let down  Tanya Z says: thanx. Rob. I needed that  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: im sorry but your right.... i didn't no what Rahore meant, as I unlike some undisclosed people, have better things to do in my life than spend all my time looking up words in the dictionary and by doing so unsucessfully trying to make people feel insuperior  When did I eat that? says: i dont look these words up, they are in my vocabular by natural means  Tanya Z says: surely different vocabularies aren't what's splitting u guys up?!  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: no there obvioulsy not, because you dont just know words , you either look for them, hear them or are taught them, and if I hang out around people that dont talk using 50 syllables in a scentence then thats my choice  Tanya Z says: and is this entirely based over the "HSU"   "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: in his mind yes  When did I eat that? says: my mom taught me advanced words in my speech therapy because I head Severe Phonological Disorder  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: but i have alot more important things than a small organization  Tanya Z says:   what of such vocab being an issue? I've never heard this befor now  When did I eat that? says: nice to know that u know what is in my mind.....  When did I eat that? says: i sure wish I knew what was in my mind  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: you've already told me this, but maybe u then need to know that 99.999999999999999999% of people dont have their mom teach them advanced vocabulary, so they dont know what rahoar means  When did I eat that? says: actually, it was my mom who taught them in place of a speech therapist  Tanya Z says: rapore, but this can't be a serious reason?!!!  Tanya Z says: Robert! No guilt tripping us into tragidy allowed!  When did I eat that? says: i am not guilt tripping  Tanya Z says: good.  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: i no he has a problem, its called being a perfectionist, maybe instead of being self insecure and trying to fix it by pointing out other peoples mistakes u should concentrate on your own mistakes. You can't judge or stop other peoples mistakes, the only one you can judge or control are your own,so start concentrating on your own mistakes and stop concentrating on other peoples mistakes  When did I eat that? says: okay, so is your point in life to make large posts that are meaningless?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: let me guess its spelled "Know" not "no"  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: there he goes againg   "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *again  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: yeah tonya's back  Tanya Z says: so ultimately, u guys are willing to terminate your relationship over the above reasons  Tanya Z says: lol. I never left    When did I eat that? says: I have my own reasons for terminated it  When did I eat that? says: and im sure josh does too, but im not about to tell you whats in joshs head  Tanya Z says: I'm sure that's the case. Any of these u think need to be expressed?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: well i like always, have told him why im no longer his freind, he has both been told, and from what he has done, he to probably was able to know why without me having to tell him  Tanya Z says: So, this is how uy guys want it to end?  When did I eat that? says: well maybe  Tanya Z says: ... or maybe not then?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: like i said from the beinging grounds for a freindship is built on respect  When did I eat that? says: and i dont respect josh  Tanya Z says: yes. That's very true  Tanya Z says: oh.  Tanya Z says: I meant in regards to Josh's statement  When did I eat that? says: okay, right now I want to work towards the successful closure of the relationship  When did I eat that? says: I for one is ready for resolution  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: well actually the thing can be said about my feelings towards robert, now obviously everyone knows why i no longer respect him but hes made no comments on how he possibly would have no respect for me  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: theres nothing to resolve , though i dont think positivly of you, and i dont think negatively of you I just simple dont care  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *simply  When did I eat that? says: I tried to close the situation. I reached for closure  Tanya Z says: is there anything you've always wanted to say Josh? What is it that u are going to acredit to the "brake up" if you will  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: thats the thing its not a "brake up" he thinks we were in some sort of homosexual liberal gay marriage, srry but i now just like before dont swing that way  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: i call it a freindship  When did I eat that? says: ive always wanted to say that my weight and my comments about myself and my caloric intake are my own deal and he  should butt out of my personal affairs  Tanya Z says: if I were terminating my relationship with a g/f it would still be a break up to me.  Tanya Z says: and I think I would still miss that person.  When did I eat that? says: at least were not calling it a divorce. when a marriage is terminated it is a DIVORCE not a break up  Tanya Z says: lol. I beleive I've used that term to be honest    When did I eat that? says: tanya did earlier  When did I eat that? says: Tawn Tawn is Smart Smart  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: no mr perfectionist as a child that has lived through divorce, they may legally call it a divorce, but in realitiy they say theive broken up or split  Tanya Z says:   Tawn Tawn eh?  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *theh have  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: stupid keyboard  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *they have  Tanya Z says: lol. it's all good  When did I eat that? says: and I havent been through a divorce? My two biological parents divorced and it was the bloodies divorce ive heard of When did I eat that? says: i know things about my family that God himself wouldnt want to know  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: aYour right, no ones life is as bad as robs, you lived through a BIOLOGICAL divorce which is so much harder than my or others lives, you just have the worst life ever and we should all just dwell on that instead of getting over our problems or hardships  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: -says josh sarcastically  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: lol  When did I eat that? says: brillant sarcasm  When did I eat that? says: brilliant    "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: oh but academic people aren't smart enough to use sarcasm, according to J**** veiws its the same with applieds   "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *applieds  When did I eat that? says: and this comes from where?

I keep my word!  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: i dont want to talk from a biased, non respectfull, hatefull, SPITEFULL person  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *talk to  When did I eat that? says: See, that used to bug me, but as far as im concerned, i dont care what u say, because you are nothing  When did I eat that? says: insults are one of the lowest forms of insult  When did I eat that? says: communication*  Tanya Z says: lol.

When did I eat that? says: i will sit where I always sit, talk to people I always talk to, and stand at the bus stop where I always stand When did I eat that? says: i will not change my life  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: Once again i cant say, as thats exactly what he wants , but I dont care if the pathetic excuse for a human being that is Rob  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: *care about  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: what he thinks  When did I eat that? says: thats nice  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: And if you do come near me ever whether on the bus or no i will stop the problem  When did I eat that? says: next thing I know going to food basics is going to be considered stalking you?  When did I eat that? says: like i said I will sit where I always sit, talk to whom I always talk to, and stand where I always stand  When did I eat that? says: like i said I will not change my life  "I didn't do it"- Michal Jackson        (Child Rapist) says: its my right not to fell insecure such as the jests from insecure people who take there problems and imperfections out on others, so once again as the your beloved Charter stated everyone has the right to security of the person, now I will be trying my best not violate your rights, by trying to avoid you where possible and I will hope that u will do the same When did I eat that? says: you are out of line  Tanya Z says: surely ttl avoidence is a little dramatic?

      Im a "not so mean" (paraphrasing what Elise said that Im not evil enough), fat, blogging machine! But anyways, today some questions were raised (Thanks Chuckie) about my gender preferance. I assure you that I am straight. Although homosexuals are very fine people, and I get along with them fine, as Josh would put it "I don't swing that way". And people, you can give me dirty looks, laugh, giggle, gossip if you will about my open non-homophobia (not being sickened/afraid by gay people), Quite frankly scarlet, I don't give a damn. Just a post to clarify. The following do not make a person gay:  Cher (although she is "The Queen of the Gays" (another great quote from Chuckie)) Talking With Homosexuals Consorting With Homosexuals Caring about self-image, hygene, and body care (also known as metro-sexual, and no, that is not having sex with a subway or bus) (and on that note, I don't go for manicures, pedicures, spa days, etc....I shower every day, change every day, and always have clean laundry). The Song, "It's Raining Men" Cooking Baking Well, this list could go on, and lets get to the bottom line, and that is I am not homosexual.  Well, there was a good waste of a post. But if Chuckie ever reads this, I am not coming out of a closet, nor am I a closet. Also, my bosoms do not neet a closet for themselves. And a final note.....If I was gay I would openly admit it. I would not be ashamed. I applaud those gays who are open and free with their homosexuality.  And to Holly B, incase she ever reads, The Gay Court of Law is Now In Sessions, Will the Honourable Judge please flip the switches. FLIP THEM. NOW!!!!!!!!

      Well, a fresh start for everyone. Tanya, Michael, I am sorry for comments and censorship. Everyone else, sorry for putting you in between...  Now on to the post! (on that note tomorrow I need to go to the post office. post....post....post....)  Too Much Work? Overstressed? Need a day off? Take a page out of bobert's blog. Of course I have my mother to back me up when I want to stay home. But I always have a honest and valid excuse. Monday? I was tired, I felt shitty, I had egg the night before and got ill! So I have a reason (however minute). I checked the internet time and time again and there is no thourough manual or guide on how to steal a day off from school. First, determine the type of parent you have.   The Types ---------------------  1.) The fussy gussy: When you say you're sick, they worry. They want to check your temperature, keep you warm (or cool, depending), and tend on you hand and foot. If this describes your parents, see Section 1.  2.) The pouty doubty: You say you're sick, eh? Prove it! Does that sound like your parent(s)? If it does, see Section 2.  3.) The easy breezy: If you need some time off, your parent(s) understand. Just have a good reason. See Section 3.  4.) The too-busy-to-care: Often mistaken for Pouty and Easy. They don't want you to stay home, but don't have the time to check. What ever will you do? See Appendix 1.  SECTION ONE, THE FUSSY GUSSY -------------------------------------------------  You are stuck with the MOST DIFFICULT parent to fool. If you say "don't worry, i'll be able to fend for myself" they may read that "I'm faking it, send me to school mommy! (or daddy or grammy or whatever). Find a way to boost that temperature. If they have to be distracted for a while, find a heat source (hot water tap should work nicely) and boost that temperature to around 102-104°F (if you have a Farenheit thermometre) or if you are a truly metric Canadian (GO METRIC) 38.89-40°C. Why did you need to go to the bathroom? Diahreaah? Felt like vomitting? You decide. Don't go above 104°F (or 40°C) otherwise your fussy gussy might race you to the hospital, and while you may of wasted some time, you'll be serving longer in GROUNDING because you will have been exposed. Now that you have the fever, refuse to let them touch you. A fussy gussy usually can tell by the forehead. Periodically throughout the day suddenly RUSH to the bathroom like there's no tomorrow. Retch (force vomit if you feel fussy gussy is getting wise to you. Force vomit by playing with your gag reflex with your finger or an object (toothbrush, etc...). Or go with the trust standby, diarheaa. Pour some water with ice cubes in the toilet for a nice PLOPPING runny sound. Yeah, its disgusting to see written, but if you want optimal effect......But don't do a vomit run more than 3-4 times, and always drink fluids after each run, otherwise fussy gussy will be worried about dehydration. Diahreaah can be 6-8+ if needed, but space them out so that fussy gussy really gets to worry. REFUSE the hospital. Say it was a bit o'bad pork, or ham, or bad alfalfa, whatever. If that doesn't work, just say that you are starting to feel better. Lame excuse, but what else have you got?  SECTION TWO: THE POUTY DOUBTY -----------------------------------------  Ms (or Mr) Pouty isn't AS hard to fool as a fussy. But you still need effort. Usually pouty's are people who have to work during the day, so you have pressure few minutes to convince them. You have to pull the tricks that fussy has to do, but in a shorter time. But once they are gone, you've got free range of the house and don't have to act all day. If a sitter or someone is there to watch you, follow fussy gussy guidelines loosly. ANY phone calls you recieve, speak hoarsly and pained, for it might be Parent/Guardian checking up, or the school to ask where you are (if parent forgot to phone).  SECTION THREE: THE EASY BREEZY (not beautiful cover girl lol) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  YOU'VE GOT IT MADE IN THE SHADE PAL! Just make up an excuse. See Appendix 2 for Easy Breezy and Other Excuses. At first easy might be doubty, just give a little fussy gussy evidence and your're on your way!  APPENDIX ONE: THE DON'T HAVE TIME TO CARE ---------------------------------------------------------  Well, you have a tough thing ahead of you. Treat as if a Fussy Gussy Pouty Doubty.  APPENDIX TWO: EXCUSES ----------------------------------------  This is my favourite list of excuses. Try them!  1. I am really tired. I tried so long to memorize for the /INSERT EVENT HERE\ that I wore myself out. 2. The always loved FAKE SICK 3. I ate some bad /ENTER FOOD HERE4. 24 hour flu! 5. If you are adventurous (or its Thursday, wanna have 5 day weekend) 48 Hour Flu. 6. You caught something at SCHOOL (and don't want to recirculate it, better stay home and fight it :) 7. I am having a real problem with some people at school, I need a day to set my affairs in order. 8. I need a day away from the noise and hussle-bussle of school to recap on my thoughts and I get SO much more work done at home.  Well, thats about it. If you have ammendments, excuses, or otherwise, please feel free to comment. There is a Comments (0) thing at the bottom. Please fill it up!  With Love,  Bobert

      Well, you've all heard me say them. Now here is a regularily updated list of quotes!  -Don't live in the past. Learn from it. Because those who can learn from their past and use it to mold their character and their future will be the truly happy.   -Don't dwell in the past. For dwelling is a place to live, and noone should live in the past.  -Don't stress over the little things. The little things exist to get to you, so don't let them.  -Don't be negative. For when you are negative it drags other people down with you. Be happy and positive, in hopes that it will bring other people to that level.  -(this is not one of my own invention, but a common cliché) He who lives in a glass house should not thrown stones.  -In this world there are things that are going to drag you down. But if you let that happen, you'll drag down someone, and they'll drag down someone, so on and so forth until the inevitable collapse of a group of people.  -Don't be hard and insult yourself. For when you turn on yourself you have noone left to fall back on.  -(Another cliché) When life hands you lemons, make lemonaide! (Or lemon merangue pie....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...pie)  -Racism. Stop It. (totally stolen from the Government of Canada)  -(stolen from song) Come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody get together, try to love one another right now!  -A smile should be a lantern to the world.  -Whatever doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.

      Well, I took another day off school today. Sometimes you'll find that you need some time for yourself. With the pressures of daily life and the annoyances of the world, a day off is just what the psychotherapist ordered!

      During the months of April/May I have lost 3 friends. Whilst one of these (Joshua Hughes) was dropping a seamingly dead weight, the loss of Tanya Thomson and Michael Chanady will hurt for a while. However I like to think I learn from every path I travel. From that path it made me realize a few things. One is that true friends will stick by you through thick and thin, water and mud, etc. Those who dump you because of an imperfection aren't worth it. Another thing I learned? I learned that you cannot take friends for granted. While you may develop a rapport with friends, it is not wise to let your guard down for a long while. Thirdly, I learned that in life it is never going to help anyone to be negative, pessamistic, and downtrodden. So to Tanya and Michael, and even to Josh to some extent, Thank you. The lessons I learned from these relationships have helped me create a brand new outlook on life, and allowed me to think positively towards life.   Now I have some more good news. After many long and painful months, I have finally made up with my father. Unlike some, he didn't demand a great long journey down a road of self-discovery. All he asked is that I respect him and those important to him. And with that (or as I percieve things) things where forgiven. After months of signing From Evan, its now changed to Love Dad. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms. Rex, my Guidance Counselor. You gave me the courage I needed to write an email to my dad. Thank you Ms. Rex. Along with an improving relationship with my father, his significant other, Sheila, is also optimistic and ready for a relationship again. She said she knows where the pain and the hurt stemmed from. She forgave me for the past and looks forward to the future.   I have created for myself a statement (quote if you will) that is now my life motto. Don't live in the past. Learn from it. Because those who can learn from their past and use it to mold their character and their future will be the truly happy.  Thats one of my new catch phrases.   Well, it is getting late, and I have to go to school in the morning. To my beloved readers, and those who may read it for a glance of information about them, I bid you goodnight *breaks out into a 6 minute So Long, Farewell, Aufweidersein adieu song like the Vontrapp Family Children*  With Love, Bobert

      Well, it didn't happen. Mom is STILL in the hospital. Yeah, thats right. Damned doctors make everything so damned dramatic. So she will be in there for "a couple more days". Damn. It is so annoying. No wonder why the TV show ER is so good. It wouldn't surprise me if they all had medical degrees, because I am sure half of med school is acting class. Bloody hell.  Well, I don't have much else to say. I really don't. Why are you still reading? I said I was done. Okay, now you need a life! Still reading, eh? Loser. Looooossserrr! If you are still reading by now you will be fat, ugly, and unpopular for the next .000254 seconds. Yeah, thats right, you heard me. .000254. Take that. Take that to the moon and bring me back some cheese. Wow, you are STILL reading. Bloody hell.................      (am I done yet) yes, yes I am

      The title alone opens a can of worms!  So as you all know, I took another day off school (blushes). I think everyone should have 1 (or 2) flex days per school week, where you can take it off whenever. Or you could "bank" your flex days and take a week off! Oh well. So I spent the day reformatting (for you non-technologically endowed folks, thats erasing everything from a hard drive) and installing. So first I install Mandrake Linux 9.2. All's well. I install Windows 98 and alls well. Same with 2000, and then XP. Low and behold what does XP do? It decides it wants to ERASE Linux. Theres 30 minutes of Linux time wasted. Does Microsoft really hate Linux that much that XP erases it? Talk about taking a grudge too far. So now I am updating XP and what not. After this, I will be installing all of XP's applications (Word, games, etc). Then I will install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, just for shits and giggles. AND THEN I have to install Linux AGAIN (4th time in the past 3 days).   Now only Linux people will understand the next part...  Stupid LILO is being a bitch. It shows soo many entries when I want to start my computer. It has:  linux failsafe windows windows2 floppy old_windows old_windows2  AND ITS DRIVING ME NUTS! I went into the lilo.conf file in the /etc/ folder and edited out the floppy, windows, windows 2, old windows 2 and failsafe (cause old_windows is what takes me to my Microsoft boot selector that asks me Windows 98, 2000, XP, Server 2K3). But nonetheless they STILL show up. LILO is driving me insane. A short trip all the same, but still. DAMN YOU LILO. DAMN YOU TO THE DEPTHS OF LINUX HELL FROM WENCE YOU CAME!  In the end, for me the endless question for Linux or Windows? BOTH! Why restrict to one? Linux is awesome, Microsoft is compatible. If only all the Windows programs worked in Linux.......Oh well.  By the way, I am taking another "flex day" tomorrow (well, by the time someone reads this, today). I gotta clean the house because me mammy might be out of L'hopital tomorrow (today).

      Well, it's happening. Jeff (if you don't know who he is by now, learn, Jeff=Mom's Boyfriend) placed an ad in the paper for the sale of Chelsie. She is a beautiful female golden retriever...The ad goes as follows:  "GOLDEN RETRIEVER Female, 2.5 yrs. Obedience trained & friendly with people. $600. o.b.o. 905-648-2172."  -Ad placed in The Hamilton Spectator. Ad added May 18th (yes, today), 2004.  Now I doubt anyone who reads this blog will be able to afford a $600.00 dog. Well, afford, maybe. Want? Thats a whole different can of worms. The ad should of said this  "GOLDEN RETRIEVER Female, 2.5 years, spayed, shots, trained, good with people $600.00 or best offer 905-648-2172"  But nonetheless 4 people called today. So far, in my mind, I have chosen the people. They just recently lost a golden retriever (died) and has another golden retriever who is in shock over the death. They are good with dogs and are looking for another golden retriever in order to cheer up the dog surviving.  This hurts like a bitch (no pun intended). Do all bad things come in bundled packages? It seems like it. Mom gets admitted to the hospital, Chelsie is being sold, Jeff is being an idiot, and school is into crunch time. Why do bad things do that? Do they just wait for other bad things, and hop on the bandwagon? It seems to be so.  If he sells this dog, I will never forgive him. I won't hate him, but I will have definately lost uber amounts of respect for him (and he was already working from a deficit). However I do realize that it is for the best. She is affected me mom's health, she is cooped up in the basement all day (with only a short bit outside), she is alone a lot of the time (but she absolutely adores people), and she is too big and loud for where we live. But why did they get her if they knew that this would happen. God only knows why they did this. It is making me go on an emotional roller coaster and I am dying of pain. Not all the money in all the world, not all the lyposuction, plastic surgery in all the world, nothing in the world will make me feel better. Haven't I been jabbed in the heart too many times in these short 15 years? Haven't I suffered enough? For heaven's sake, how much is ONE person expected to take. If the first 15 years have been like this, is the worst yet to come?   I have to stop writing, because pretty soon my eyes are going to be too clouded by tears to do anything.  Goodnight and God Bless, Bobert  P.S. The dog is still for sale, so if any of you need a $600.00 dog, give 905-648-2172 a jangle...

      Well, first lets appologize (cough tanya) for not writing for a long time. I've been downtown at St. Joseph's Hospital, and I can't get internet access there. So I'll explain the last few days.  It all started Thursday night when I went to bed. Well, thats a lie. It started when I got woken up at 5AM Friday morning (I usually get up at 6:30/6:45/6:55) (excuse if the writing is bad, my dogs are really pissing me off). My mom woke me up to get her nebulizer (for those of you who are outside the asthma community, a nebulizer is liquid forms of puffers (i.e. Berotec (feneterol hydrobromide), Atrovent, Ventolin (salbutimol), etc) that is put into a kinda sealed cup with a nask attached. An air hose (if at home) or an oxygen tube (if in hospital or have a home oxygen tank). When the air reaches the liquid medication, it vapourizes and is breathed in through the mask). So yeah, she wakes me up to get her nebulizer, so I pour in the berotec nebule and the atrovent nebule and close the cup and start the machine. I go back to bed. I think it was just an asthma attack...  So I get home from school and cook supper. Mom phones and says she won't be home right away. When she does get home, she is barely breathing. Once again, Berotec nebulizer and puffer treatments (almost ODed). Nothing worked. So around 10:30PM Friday, Jeff (you know who he is) took her to the St. Joseph's Hospital Emergency Room. They rushed her to critical care. They wanted to intubate her (shove a tube down her throat and pump in air) but she refused. Oxygen and berotec was administered. They also ran solumedrol (a steroid used in asthma treatment, comnmonly known as Prednisone). So she was in ER until 8PM yesterday. Then they moved her to floor 7, room 7** (yeah, like I will tell you what room!!!).   So yeah, sounds good? Wrong. Dr.*some middle eastern name like cookamungeroanspikgnolasnghaodfh* and Dr. Nair both say that she will be there until at least Monday. Dr. Jesheck (sp? Its said Yesheck) said she looks horrible. So what does this remind me of???? When she was hospitalized in March on a Friday. They sound Monday.....Then it was Tuesday...When did she leave? SATURDAY! Bloody f***ing hell!   On top of this, they want to put her on "maintenance" steroids (so like life long almost). Corticosteroids they are called. They want her on Advair (shes already taking that along with Atrovent and Berotec). Advair contains a corticosteroid and a ventolin-like substance. In addition, they want her on Symbicort (another corticosteroid/ventolin-like thing, but different cortico/ventolin). Then Singulair (ANOTHER corticosteroid). And then they might have to continue with Solumedron (Prednisone)  So forgive me if I am distracted. Forgive me if I am negative. Forgive me if I break down in uncontrollable, insane tears. Sorry folks, but this person is too worried to care about anything else.  However I would like to add that EVERYONE has been so kind through all of this. The hospital staff, I love you all, you are doing a great job. And my uncle, aunt, other aunt, Grandad, Grandma, and even my mom's colleagues (shout out to Lynn) THANKS A BUNCH for your kindness. I Love you all and am glad to have you.

      Wow, how strange. I'm pregnant! Well, not really. But i'm due next week...For any of you "out of the loop", next week I am bringing home a mechanical baby. Thats right. And I even have names! If it's male, then it's name will be Cheridan Charles Genung (Cher Chuckie for short). If it's female, Cherilyn Sarkasian LaPier Genung (hey! thats Cher's real name minus the Genung part). Thats right. My computerized child will be named after Cher! And other than that, they have another thing in common other than the name. THEY ARE BOTH MOSTLY MADE OF PLASTIC. Sorry Cher, I poke fun out of love :). Well, if only its crying was "This is a song for the ..." (hungry, lonely, dirty, etc.). Unfortunately, babies can't sing Cher. Oh well, c'est la vie!  By the way, I get to wear an empathy belly.....  By the way, the song on my site has changed. Guess to what! CHER!!!!

      Cette poste est pour tous les lecteurs français que j'ai. ....I rire au nombre de lecteurs français. zéro! Cette poste est détachément traduite, donc la plupart de probable c'est grammaticalement inexact.   This post is for all the French readers I have.....I laugh at the number of french readers. zero! This post is loosly translated, so most likely it is grammatically incorrect.     Et pour tout vous francophones. Ouais, je vous aime tout. Vos sons nasaux me font heureux. Et se rappeler: Ce Soir pour la première fois juste environ 10:30 il va commencer pleuvoir les hommes. IL PLEUT DES HOMMES!!    Tout ce commencé environ 4 ou de 5 mois il y a. Ma maman est dans sa pièce, et elle a de l'eau sur sa commode. Qu'arrive-t-il? D'une manière ou d'une autre l'eau renverse sur son réveille-matin, le ruinant. Donc elle me dit et que finit-il par hapening? Mon réveille-matin la devient. Lequel ne serait pas normalement un problème, sauf j'ai payé ce réveille-matin avec mon propre argent! Cette droite. Donc pour le moment j'ai utilisé un programme de réveille-matin sur mon ordinateur. Travaillé grand, jusqu' à Jeff a obtenu un travail! Comment affecte-t-il lequel vous ne pouvez pas comprendre, puisque il est sourd, qu'il votre programme de réveille-matin? Bien, parce que pour son travail qu'il doit se réveiller à 4:30 SUIS. Ouais. Donc ma maman se sent qu'elle doit se lever avec lui, et alors elle travaille en ligne (son travail en ligne) jusqu'à ce qu'elle doit aller travailler. Mais dans le procédé, elle rend infirme mon réveille-matin parce qu'aussitôt qu'il s'allume elle le ferme de! Comment efficace est cela? Et alors à peu près 15 minutes après il saute, elle me réveille en haut. Ceci m'urine de. Le quel mauvais endroit pour amener un bébé dans! Je suis enceinte et dû la semaine prochaine. Plus sur ce plus tard ou demain. Toujours et à jamais appeler 1-800-267-2001. Oh ouais, aller à http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk Cette droite. Le bouchon effronté pour Gwenn!     And for all you anglophones. Hoo hoo hoo hooooo. I laugh at you through my nasal sounds.   All of this started about 4 or 5 months ago. My mom is in her room, and she has water on her dresser. What happens? Somehow the water spills onto her alarm clock, ruining it. So she tells me and what ends up hapening? My alarm clock becomes her. Which normally wouldn't be a problem, except I paid for that alarm clock with my own money! Thats right. So for the time being I have been using an alarm clock program on my computer. Worked great, until Jeff got a job! Which you may not understand, since he's deaf, how does that affect your alarm clock program? Well, because for his work he must wake at 4:30 AM. Yeah. So my mom feels she has to get up with him, and then she works online (her online job) until she has to go to work. But in the process, she disables my alarm clock because as soon as it comes on she shuts it off! How effective is that? And then about 15 minutes after it goes off, she wakes me up. This is pissing (note for the translation I said that this is urinating me off) me off. What a bad place to bring a baby into! I'm pregnant and due next week. More on this later or tomorrow. Always and forever call 1-800-267-2001.   By the way, go to: http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk http://frengus.tk Shamless plug for Gwenn!  by the way, IL PLEUT DES HOMMES is french for IT'S RAINING MEN

      No, I am not talking about Bernard Laundry, the Quebec person. I am talking about laundry laundry. You know the cleansing of soiled garments by mean of water and detergent or dry chemicals.  So today for no apparent reason I am pissed off at Jeff, just one of those days. So to give myself a project, I decide to go unclog the fabric softener dispenser of our washing machine. So I unclog it, water runs out of it fine, so I decide to run a load of clothing through. So I threw in a carefully designated pile of only my clothing. I cranked the size to “Super”, water temp Warm/Cold (Warm water wash, cold water rinse). I turned the dial to 15-Super Duty Wash (or something like that, for really clean clothes) and pulled, as pulling the dial starts the machine. The water starts to pour in. Then I add a little more than the “recommended amount” of detergent (this time it is Sunlight Morning Fresh) and put in the clothes. In the freshly cleaned softener dispenser I add uber large amounts of softener. And not the regular, big bottle unconcentrated stuff. No. I fill the dispenser to the top with Downy April Fresh ultra concentrated softener (you are supposed to use ½ a capful). And I start. Then I started the dryer to dry the things just previously in the wash.  About an hour later a buzzer goes off. The dryer is done. While there I was going to put my clothes into the dryer (as the clothing in there was dry) and put in another load. Much to my surprise, I open the washer and it is FULL OF WATER. That’s right. Why was it? Well, when you close the lid of a top loading washing machine, a little probe pushes down a button signalling to the machine that the lid is closed so it can spin uber fast and not spray water or hurt anyone. Well, the button had become dislodged. So I attempted to screw it in. But where the screws would mount the button module, the casing was broken. So I pulled out the handyman’s secret weapon, DUCT TAPE. I taped that button down so good it didn’t know what pressed it! So then I drain the water out and run the load again (because old water is just ICKY). And it all works. So I tell my mom that there was this problem. “Tell Jeff” she says. So I say back, “I am a perfectly competent person and can fix things on my own, and do not need Jeff”. So I did fix it....  So Jeff decides to (later that night) look at the thing. So I went upstairs after showing him where the thing was. What did he do? He took off my carefully wrapped and placed tape, turned off the water supplies for hot and cold to the washer, and tells my sister to not do laundry. Well, fat chance I would listen to that. Why would he make something that I fixed (even if temporarily) broken again? So I told my mom and she told me “Just put the tape back on and do laundry”. So I did. That’s when I discovered the water was turned off. Did he think he could outsmart me by closing a couple of valves? Honestly, give me some credit. I may be a tad dense at times, but for heavens sake, my IQ is 175!!! (okay, it has been down to 168, depending on the test. The IQ averages are: 80-120 is average, 121-150 is above average, 151+ is Genius level). He thought he could outsmart me with water taps. If he wanted to stop the laundry, why didn’t he turn off both sets of taps (the ones supplying the sink, which then lead to a tap for the washer in a series type connection) and take away the water supply hoses? So, essentially, I won the game of wit this time, and I am not altogether surprised. As we speak now, two blankets are in the washing machine, and I believe they are in spin cycle.  With Love,  Bobert  P.S. Yes, I realize the stupidity of a post about washing machines, but it had to be said. I am pretty sure Jeff is part of the Anti-Laundry Coalition of Canada (ALCC). There motto? Smellier, Dirtier, Waterless... At least you learned a few things:  To recap: My IQ: 168-175 Level Classification: Genius (you would never guess when meeting me, I try to not let it go to my head). Average IQ: 80-120 Above Avereage: 121-150 Genius 151+ Jeff is the Anti-Laundry

      Have you ever taken the time to think about the simple things we have in this life that 100 years ago were only dreamed (or being invented?) Well, tonight I will discuss the telephone. By dialing 7-15 numbers you can reach anywhere in the world (some places like Alberta is urban areas you would dial 555-1212 not 780-555-1212. Yeah, like an edmonton to edmonton or surrounding area call. But Edmonton to Calgary? 403-555-1212...... and international calls outside US/Canada you dial +011+country code+area code+phone number) All by pressing some numbers!   What happens when the power goes out? The phone is there! (if you have seen the Bell commercials where it is like "the lights out out, Bell is there"). Why? Well, it is very simple. If you've ever opened the jack in your wall for the phone, beyond where the jack is (the bare wires), you'll notice 2, 3, 4, or even 6 wires. These wires are dedicated, run by the phone company, not by another service. So 2 of these wires are dedicated for your phone. The others are used for another line, DSL, etc. So that still doesn't explain why it stays on. Well, these wires (copper) and then linked to your phone company (copper until a neighbourhood box or even until the switch, or it may be fibre optic or hibrid fiber coax (HFC) cable, or just plain coax. These wires are hooked to the phone company's power supply, not Hamilton Hydro's (or Hydro One, Epcor, L'Eletrical-Poopies Quebec, whatever). So if the power goes out for your house, it doesn't affect the phone company's power. What if the power goes out for the phone company (Thank you goes out to: Dalton McGuinty, Ernie Eves, Mike Harris, gotta love the privatizing and the "promised no hikes in electricity" cough cough......4.3 cents to 4.7 for the first 700kWh and 5.3 (or 5.7) after? Sounds like a hike Dalton.....premier liar!) Well that doesn't matter. The phone company has an EXTENSIVE battery backup and backup generators. Thats nice, but if lightning hits a phone pole, down goes the wires, and cuts the supply, right? WRONG! They are wrongly named phone poles. They carry no phone lines (except in rare cases). Those are hydro poles. Almost ALL of the phone company's wires are burried. So no ice storm, hurricane, tornado (well, maybe a tornado if it rips the box out of the ground) will cut the cord.  So thats good, but how does it all work? Well, the telephone is one of the SIMPLEST devices. It consists of a speaker (what you put to your ear), and microphone (well...the thing to your mouth), a ringer, a duplex coil (so you can't hear yourself through the speaker) a touchtone keypad and frequency generator (the dialpad) and the hook switch (the thing that hangs up the phone). So sure, now you have a phone, but what is beyond those two dedicated copper cables? Well your in luck, cus I know!  So you dial a number. It rings. Someone answers. Why? In the days of the manual switchboard, there was a pair of copper wires running from every house to a central office in the middle of town. The switchboard operator sat in front of a board with one jack for every pair of wires entering the office. Well, back in "the good 'ol days" they actually had a manual, human operated switchboard. Yes, HUMAN! When you would pick up your phone, a little light would shine above your jack on the switchboard. At that point the operator would plug his/her (usually her at that time) headset into the jack and then ask who or what number you would like to talk to. She would then plug your jack into the jack of the person you wished to contact and she would send a ring signal. Then a light would go on above their jack signalling that they were connected. When the call was terminated, the lights would extinguish and the operator would pull the cable out. Very simple, yet a lot of work.   A long distance call was hell for them I bet. You would connect to the operator and tell them the phone number of who you would like to talk to. Then she would call a long distance office, where the operator would be connected to another long distance office, the one for the area code of the person you are calling. Then the operator would tell that office the number, and she would be transferred to that office. This office is the cental office for the person you are calling's area. THEN finally that operator would connect the call. VERY LENGTHY PROCESS. But simple.   Now adays it is more complex but easier to understand, if that makes sense. A box for your neighbourhood containing hundreds (maybe) of household copper wires that will run to a switch (explained in a bit) or to a digital concentrator, which digitalizes it by sample rate of 8,000 and an 8-bit resolution. Then it transmits it with hundreds of other voices through a fibre-optic or coax line to the phone company. If you are calling someone who is connected to the same switch office, it simply hooks the call through using a computerized method of the olden days, all mechanical though. and faster... If its not or is a long distance call, your voice is transferred along with millions of others in a fibre optic cable to the office of the recieving party, and may also travel over satellites and microwaves (not the ovens, but the microWAVES).   Excellent, now you know the basics. Ever wanted a simple two way phone network for fun? Well, in your parents childhood and maybe in yours you may of had the two paper cups and a piece of string, and the sound was transmitted through the string and amplified/concentrated through the cup...Well today you can set up your OWN PHONE NETWORK! all you need are two cheap phones (cordless don't work as well), a 9 volt battery, and a 300-ohm resistor (about $1 at Radio Shack). So you cut open the phone cord running out of both phones (oh yeah, you need a phone cord :P). The red copper wire inside hooks up to the battery (one phone on each terminal, so when you cut the wire in 2, hook up one end on each). Between the battery and one phone you must install the 300ohm resistor to prevent frying. Cut the phone cord as required to use the resistor. Then you plug one end of the cord into one phone, and the other into the other phone. Note you will have to strip the coating to get to the copper wire. Then pick up the phones and your voice will be carried along! Unfortuantely they cannot ring.......They need a 90 volt AC wave at 20Hz to ring. But now you have a little intercom!  Well, I daresay you know about phones now...This post is part of a series on The Simple Things in Life We Take for Granted...Tune in soon for Television and other items.

      Editing the actual list would be, as Tanya has pointed out, like changing history. But I would like to announce that someone has ascended to the ranks of those I can trust. She never really left the list, but I was wary about adding her in midst of the conflict. This person is ***TANYA Z THOMSON***. She has proven time and time again that she is trustworthy and is a good person. And of course, Michael is on the list of people who are going to burn for their lies. And Tanya, I am sorry that you had to be in the middle of all this. I am sorry for the things I said, and I am sorry for hurting you.

      Have you ever been in a situation when you believed you could trust someone and thought you were doing the right thing, only to find out the entire time you were being strung along like a puppy on a leash? Well, that once again (and for the last time) has happened. Of course, at the time of publishing I only know one side of the story, and do not know if this is the actual case (because I don't believe a single bloody word Michael says), so please bare with me.  If you have (and I am not going to publish the dirty integral story here and now until I have heard all parts and considered their validity), than remember one thing. People can be idiots. I have some tips for you that I have learned from being in these situations and being "used" and "tested".  Tips: 1. Always listen to your family. They usually know best. When they say someone is not good for you, understand they truly mean that.  2. Trust your instincts. When you hear that little voice saying "You shouldn't", listen. The voice knows.  3. If someone has hurt you once, they are, in all likelyhood, going to again!  4. Be wary of who you trust. Unless someone has proved themselves trustworthy, they aren't.  5. Unless your family has done something to prove your trust wrong, give them the benefit of the doubt.  6. If someone has hurt you, you don't need them. You can find better friends.  7. Hear all sides to a story before passing judgement.  8. If you are ever fed a line such as "We were testing you", you do not need them. However you can use this "test" to learn something.  9. Don't be bitter at the world. Some people can just be jerks!   10. The world is not picking on you.  Okay, so there are the lessons I have learned. One of the most important is to not let it get to you. It may hurt, but don't bother with it. It is irrelevent! Find the good part of the situation and let that shine. Remember, you are valid, you are a good person, and you are not hated.  And in my defense for this situation (as from what I know) I was manipulated into saying some things. A friend whom I trusted much much more than the other manipulated me into feeding lines to the other. Now this part is party to change, as I have not heard the other side of the story yet. I trusted T much more than M. T got me to say things to M. I don't trust M...You fill in the blanks.

      The world is really truly full of liars. I have been hurt one too many times by people by lies and so called "tests". There is a short list of people I will trust, and once and for all, I will publish the list.  Mother Sister Grandparents (both sides) Myself My Doctor The administration at school My aunt  And thats the end of the list. If you didn't arrive on the list, don't feel hurt. I have a reason for not putting you on (not a close enough connection, you have proven yourself untrustworthy, not old enough to be trusted, etc.). So to those who seem to like to "test" me, go fuck yourselves.

      Yoko Ono's a bitch. A true cold hearted bitch. Why am I posting about the bitch of a wife of a great singer? I don't know, I'm bored, so lets fry this 71 year old bitch. Reasons why Yoko's a bitch:  John Lennon took 6 bullets in the chest, Yoko's standing right next to him, and doesn't get shot once......Coincidence? I Think Not....Did he run out of bullets? No...Conspiracy? BINGO!  She contributed to the ultimate demise of the Fab 4! (Of course I mean the Beatles)  The recently released DVD, Lennon's Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon was one of her bitchy tricks. On the classic song #9 Dream, Yoko Oh-no edited herself into the original video, mouthing the backup vocals that were sung on the original recording by Lennon's girlfriend at the time, May Pang. What will she do next?  She sat in on the Beatles recording sessions. 'Nough said.  She started the Plastic Ono Band...Shameless plug for herself, don' you think?  Overall she is a saggy-breasted, fat, ugly, old slob who wasnt fit to be within 100 feet of the Beatles.

      Posted June 1st in the morning: As soon as that baby starts to cry, I'll be there for it, when the rain starts to fall, i'll be there for it, like i've been there before, i'll be there for it, cause it's there for me tooo!   --------------------------------------------  The reality of after I got my baby:  I got outside and it started to rain. I got on the bus and it eased off a bit. I got off the bus and it was torrential downpour like uber water and hail like a full blast water hose. I got on another bus and it was all fine! I got off the bus WAM! It started to fall harder again. So the funny i made earlier, I'll be there for it, when the rain starts to fall.........Damn that funny. Damn it to hell and beyond. Not only did the rain start to fall......I'm pretty sure the Hamilton area churches put their offering monies together to build an ark! Two of every animal, except the homosexual....I poke fun because I am on caffeine sleep (which is the state in which I did not sleep, but let caffeine fuel everything) and if I am a bitch first period (because I am construcively evacuating [blah, im skipping] periods 2-4) thats because I went to bed at 1:45 monday night and woke up at 7, didn't sleep tuesday night, so I am sleeping ALL OF WEDNESDAY (minus first period). Welcome to my world. Don't touch the merchandise.......Cause if you do.......Hey look, pretty halucinations dancing in the corner of my room! Elise, were those really advil? Wait a minute, I haven't taken advil for like 2.5 months.....This is what caffeine sleep does to you.....No sleepy, you see thingys....Actually I am not hallucinating, and I am glad I am not. Have a nice night/morning.

      At first, when I heard Mrs. Warren explaining the Baby, Think it Over program I thought the name was kinda lame. But now, here  I sit at quarter to 4 (THATS AM, FOLKS, 4:45AM) still awake with this baby. I got a particularily easy one from what I have obersved. The last time it cried was at 2:08AM....So it'll start soon. This truly is a matter of Baby. THINK IT OVER. I think legally any teenager wishing to have a child and is in the next short while going to attempt to conceive, are in the process of concieving, or thinking, "Awe, a baby will be nice" should have to take this baby home for a week. There is no sleep involved, you have to worry about every little thing (is its head supported? is it on its back? what does it need now?!). This is truly a case of thinking over the decision of having a baby. Not just thinking it over, living the reality! The greatest feeling I will of had this year (well, it is at par with the realization of never having to take gym again) will be when Mrs. Warren cuts this key off my wrist!!!!! Although (note 3:52AM, baby cried [thats like right now, it cried whilst writing my blog]) a fun and educational exercise, its tough. I gave up on trying to sleep! So my words of advise before getting pregnant? BABY. THINK IT OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!1

      The day I have been waiting for for most of a semester is finally here! I get my baby!!!!! Do I have the energy to watch it? Probably not! Will I be there at every crying moment? YES, OF COURSE! As soon as that baby starts to cry, I'll be there for it, when the rain starts to fall, i'll be there for it, like i've been there before, i'll be there for it, cause it's there for me tooo! Heeheeheee I made a funny...Well, I will try to keep you on a 2-hour update of the events of baby...And when I finish my Baby Journal I will publish it.  Lullaby I will sing to baby: "Strong Enough", "This is a Song for the Lonely", and:  If I could turn back time, If I could find a way, I'd take back those things that have made you, and you'd never be, if I could......Never mind, those are explicit words :D. Talk to you all later. Byes!

      Well, here I am. Writing again. This is a consolidated post. This could be a few posts, spread out over some time, but its not.  Child Labour  Sure, there are kids overseas who work in sweatshops, etc for next to nothing. But if you think about it, children and teens do so much around the house it is astronomic. We do this to "help out". But think, if we left, the amount of work for parents! Well, stay at home parents wouldn't feel the crunch. My typical day goes as such:  Wake up, drink uber amounts of coffee, run to my bus. Sit in school "learning". I get home. Make supper, do laundry, clean. Bring purse to mother, take phone calls, sometimes make lunches.   If you don't count school, I spend a large part of my time doing chores! It is starting to annoy me. And it never fails that every time I sit down to do homework, "ROBERT!!!" i hear bellowed throughout the house. Usually my mom needs something. Then I sit back down to work some more, "ROBERT!!!" again, this time maybe my sister. I do whatever and sit back down "Ding-dong" "BARK BARK BARK YAP YAP" goes the dogs until I answer the door. I sit back down "RING!!!". IT NEVER FAILS!  Well, c'est la vie!   The loss of a pet  Well, it has come to be. On the 8th/9th of June, my dog, Chelsie, is leaving us forever. She has been sold. How many nights have I spent with her, trying to keep her active. How long have I looked after her. And for what? Another heartbreak? I find tears welling in my eyes as I write this. If its this bad now, I will be insane when she does leave.

      Okay, so we all know that stereotypes exist, but man alive, they are so overused at my house its not even funny! If someone misplaces food, I get blamed for eating it. When in actual fact it is just in the back of that cupboard, or Jeff put it in mom's room. Lord! Whenever food disappears, I am to blame! Just because I am large and enjoy food doesn't mean I eat every single thing that passes in front of my bloated face! This is my pet peeve!

      Back in April, I laughed at Tanya and Michael for using conditioner. But now I too have fallen victim to the conditioner craze. It just makes my hair a little nicer to me. A short little blurb, but all the same.  Also, my heart and sympathies go out to Tanya, who has lost a dear loved one. I'll be there for whatever you need Tanya.  Final Note: Cher is coming to Hamilton in August.

      Well, the awesome powers of love have once again shone through today. We recieved Chelsie back, and she had lost lots of weight, had trouble standing, was dehydrated, and wasn't eating. CLASSIC signs of either A) Maltreatments and/or B) Depression. So Mom and Jeff were visibly angry about the situation, and the way things look now, we are keeping Chelsie. They told us in the 13 years they had a Golden Retriever, they never bathed it once except near the end. Thats 13 years of grime and dirt! That must mean they don't feed enough or give ample water. So chances are we are keeping Chelsie. HORRAH!

      Have you ever been inquired "What's the magic word" when asking for something? Well, "please" truly is the magic word. When my mom got home, I asked her to sign my carryover form. She said "later". When "later" came she signed it. Then I told her I needed her to sign a note saying that she gives me permission to:  Drop Math and go to Applied Grade 9 Math next year (see previous post) Switch Academic Math, Grade 10 to Applied Math, Grade 10 Switch Food and Nutrition for Music  And she said she was sick of signing notes! Finally, when I said "Please" she signed it. Try please. It will work*.  *By reading this you agree to indemnify Robert A. Genung, and any of his subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and members, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of claims or actions you make, by agreeing that saying please WILL work.

      Well, it has come to this. I am dropping math. I could carry over, but no. If I really wanted to, and tried hard, I could get 80s and 90s in math all the time! But I am just too damned lazy to work hard in Academic. So therefore I am dropping Academic Math and taking the easy way out, Applied.....Thats right, I said it. Applied...I am not just descending from the Gifted Mountain into the depths of Academia (mmmmm Macademia nuts), But I am going deep into the hellishly easy pits of Appliedumb. Why? Like I said, I like Easy Street. Could I excel and do wonders in Academic Math? Hell yeah! But will I? Hell no...

      Everyone, I have re-evaluated my view of religion. For a while, I refused to go to church without a reason, was extremely frightened by many aspects of religion, and even stooped so low as to make fun of people who were religious. But now I have matured my visions and have decided I am ready to go to church. What brought upon this suddent revelation? When I saw my sister in a dramatic play "Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames". It was a truly moving and influential experience. Apparantly over 200 people came to Christ over the course of 3 days after seeing the influential play. It was that night that I decided that I would rededicate myself. I was saved in September 1996, but for a long time I really didn't live up to Christianity. So that night, right there in the church pew, I prayed and reaffirmed my beliefs. Now I want to go to church! I am not going to be one of those people who carry a Bible around everywhere and quote verses left, right, and centre, but I will definately have a different point of view. Life should have more meaning now, and I feel better deep down inside.

      It's odd how life works things out...My mom bought Cher tickets the day before I got an invitation to a family reunion in July. Now I am hard pressed to recieve funds to travel! I need about $188.00 to fly to Manitoba...But without taxes, surcharges, fuel fees, NAVCAN, Airport Improvement Fees, and Security Charges it would only be $144.00. AND THATS A BIT MORE AFFORDABLE!! I don't suppose any of you reading this would like to borrow or donate to me $50 or $100 or $150??? No? Worth a shot, eh? But seeing this really makes me think, why is travel so expensive! Why don't do better research and find CHEAPER ways to travel as opposed to expensive ones. Bottom line, I need money. Problem with that! Mom can't afford it, there's no money in dad's budget for it, I am not allowed to get a job because it goes on her income tax, noone wants to hire someone like me as a babysitter, and professional services for many household duties and computer repair are very affordable if you find the right place. So what am I to do? My grandparents can't fly me out because they are already finding a way for me to get back! If anyone has any suggestions (OR MONEY, MONEY IS GOOD) please tell me.....I'm, what they call, desperate.

      Have you ever marvelled in the stupidity of examinations? Make everyone do the same test to see how much they have remember from 5 months ago...BRILLIANT! There must be a better way to evaluate knowledge other than examinations! What about people who stress out about tests! There is someone in my family living class who last year vomitted all morning from stress for exams! They are emotionally and (due to lack of sleep) physically taxing on the body! Sure my family living """"exam"""" is open book, but what about my french exam (even though my teacher said if any one of us fails the exam we still pass the course). There really is no point to final examinations and evaluations or even cumulative education. After studying hard for the exams one of the biggest things we want is to lose the knowledge! Good luck to you all with exams, and have fun!

      Have any of you actually taken the time to contemplate the idea behind fairy godmothers? Webster's defines a fairy godmother as " noun-a generous friend or benefactor". But modern society has us seeing fairy godmothers as magical beings waving wands who appear mysteriously and sing    "Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Put 'em together and what have you got bibbidi-bobbidi-boo   Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo It'll do magic believe it or not bibbidi-bobbidi-boo   Salagadoola means mechicka booleroo But the thingmabob that does the job is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo   Salagadoola menchicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Put 'em together and what have you got bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi-boo    But whens the last time you heard a "generous friend or benefactor" sing that? Tell me! WHEN! Has the definition of fairy godmother changed in the last two generations with the hour hour photo, disney-filled, rubber stamp education era? Or is Disney at fault??? Do we need to update the definition of fairy godmother? And what about fairy godfathers! There is no such definition. I've always assumed the Fairy Godfather is the leader of the Gay Mafia! When will the definitions grow to meet the world? WHEN!!!!! Disney est loco!

      Michael Moore is a genius! If you have not seen Farenheit 9/11, see it! Not only is it amazing, but its true! I have never been a documentary kinda guy, but something as provacative and occasionally funny as farenheit 9/11.....It is cleverly developed, showing just enough to leave you wanting more (but if they showed much more it would be boring, repetitive, and distasteful). Apparantly the soldiers listen to music while bombing people....One soldier listens to "The Roof Is On Fire" and then he starts singing (rather untalented, but who am I to judge!) "We don't need no water let the motherf****rs burn". Of course it WASN'T censored in the movie, and that along with some graphic footage is the difference between PG/PG13 and 14A. Oh well...At one point I felt like vomitting, and at others I was laughing at "Dubya". See it, you'll get it.

      It all started last night, when Tanya told me Farenheit 9/11 was playing in Ancaster. I said I would try to make it, but it is unlikely. So it turns out I make it. So anyways, we arrive at Silver City and buy our tickets, and have like an hour to kill. So we go over to Starbucks. I have a new love, and her name is Espresso.....Well, more like Cafe Americano. So I buy a Grande Cafe Americano. I take one sip and love it. So later I bought another one, and the guy so rudely told me "Thats just espresso and water" and I look at him and say "I know". Bloody hell. What does he think I am, an uncultured swine? I know about coffee. I know what a cafe americano consists of! I am not J****! And now, I am actually sleepy! I am going to bed after this blog post (and one about the movie of course). Starbucks.....

      I am sure there are very few people who have not gone garage saleing. Its the most awesomenest way to spend time on weekends. For instance, last weekend we went to garage sales and I got a fax machine. However, when I got home a huge area of copying was whited out. I figured the scanner inside was busted, and was prepared to keep it as a telephone but its faxing capabilities were nill. But then, I opened it and saw a multitude of dirt and sticky grime near the scanner. I cleaned that but nothing. So I left it for a while. Then I opened it up about a week later and decided to clean very well down where the scanner was. I did so and low and behold it works! Cleaning solves many problems, people! Learn that. So if something doesn't work, try cleaning it!

      Yay-ness-esk! I have my last exam tomorrow for French....PLUGH i hate french! Oh well, it is my last exam. And then I have a long, rewarding summer ahead of me. A few things have dates almost set in stone, such as:  June 22, Last Exam June 28, Federal Election July 3, Hold Garage Sale July 31, Family Reunion in MB Aug 23, CHER Concert  And a few things that are relocatable, such as:  July 27, 28, 29, or 30, Fly to Manitoba 1-2 Weeks, Unscheduled Time Slot, Granddad and Grandma's House At least 1 week in Manitoba, may be 2, starting anywhere from July 27.  So an interesting summer all around! I have a lot of stuff going on.......It appears ever clearer that I need a job. Not a conventional job, more of "odd jobs" whether it be computer repairs or babysitting. Something I can turn down once in a while. And somewhere in this time I hope to lose 10-40 lbs...Think of me, 40lbs lighter......I would look a lot better, dats fa sure! Oh well, c'est la vie. Whatever will happen will happen...  And a last little blurb.....If you have bad shoes, DO NOT WALK OVER 10 MINUTES.....I walked to Lime Ridge today and I have a blister! OUCH it hurts when it hits something.....Oh well. Goodnights everyones. Lets not lose touch over the summer. You can always call me at (905)-574-3429. And if I likes ya, I will give you the phone number of my upcoming destinations. Also, lets not forget y'all can visit me! 66-55 Towercrest Drive....Feel Free, but try to call first, as I might be out-of-province, out-of-city, or just running (ahem, bussing/sitting) about Hamilton.  Lotza Love (heeheehee), Bobert G.  P.S., Tanya, I love the idea of a picnic......Just watch out for Yogi Bear!....Now im the UberNerd...lol...

      Admitedly, it has been a while (June 26th i believe) since I have posted anything. I've just been too busy/lazy. So let us recap what has happened since my last post.  Well, of course, I saw Farenheit 9/11 on the 25th, so here we go from then.  I had a pretty quiet weekend. A doctor's appointment, but other than that. I am being taken off my medication! Yeyness-esk! Then there was an Election on the Monday. My beloved Liberal's won! I didn't do anything on the 29th. Except Michael came forth with an idea to revamp the Hamilton Student Union. Thats all I can say, due to a nda...Then on the 30th.....Don't even get me started. On the night of the 29th (oh, Michael came over with his broken computer, so I fixed it), Tanya and I were discussing what the 3 of us should do on the 30th. Somehow, Wild Water Works became an idea. So when the 30th came around, I thought it would be a good idea to have my ticket anyways, just incase we were going to go. So I bought my ticket at Shopper's just before going downtown. This was seen as presumptious, but I was prepared at least. Even after saying we didn't have to go that day (repeatedly saying that) we did end up going. Michael didn't swim. Then the 3 of us had dinner at La Spaghett. Best food I have ever eaten! And that pretty much summed up June. Canada Day rolled around, and we planned to do a lot of work on the HWSU. Unfortunately, my family duties called, so Tanya and Michael got stuck with all the work. I do feel very much so like a "rubber-stamp President" but what can you do! On Canada Day, we priced a boatload of stuff for garage sale, I planted the grapes and strawberries, and then made dinner. I made steak and chicken (my mom eats only chicken and occasionally turkey/fish), baked potatoes, and my sister made some corn-on-the-cob. It was a good meal (but it's no La Spaghett). Then after the dishes were washed, we went over to a field and set off fireworks! It was the first time we had ever set of fireworks, but it was very fun! Then we came home and I went to bed a few hours after. And now today I am writing this post and excitedly (but impatientely) waiting for the 24th, when I fly to Winnipeg. Let us hope that time flys!   UBER THANK YOU TO TANYA AND MICHAEL FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK YESTERDAY. THANKS SO MUCH!   With Love, Bobert

      Well, we are down to the wire now. My flight leaves in 9 days. Wowsers-esk. I knew that I was flying first class, but I didn't know HOW first class. It turns out I am in seat 1-A! THAT IS EXECUTIVE CLASS! That means I get a meal and an alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverage, FREE!!! I loves the first class already! On the way back I am in seat 1-F....BUT THATS STILL FIRST CLASS! Finally, no more squeezing my ample ass into tiny seats! Go first class!  Naturally I have a doctors appointment the monday before my flight. Go figures.

      Something has been haunting me for a while. It happened Father's Day EVE, 2003. About a week before my Grade 8 Graduation.  For some unknown reason, my mom, her boyfriend, and the neighbours were outside. I was sitting quietly in my room, doing nothing really. But then I get called downstairs to bring some music outside to where they were sitting. Maybe if I didn't get called down. this wouldn't of happened. But anyways, when I got there they all asked me to stay and drink and eat with them (they being mom, her b/f, and neighbours). So, on poor judgement, I drank some scotch and some whiskey (I didn't even get tipsy or drunk, just a little red. With my weight it takes uber alcohol to get me drunk, and I've never been drunk). So this carries on outside for a while.  Around 12:30AM it wrapped up, and my mom was feeling a little ill. So her boyfriend helped her to the bathroom while I got her a glass of water (an important detail, the water). So while waiting to give her the water, out of nowhere came this SHREEK from my sister's bedroom. He was yelling (like SHREEKING YELLING) at her "WHY DID YOU SPILL FUCKING WAX ON THE FUCKING CARPET, YOU FUCKING BITCH" (that is quite close, if not exactly what he said). I had spilt the wax, so I claimed the blame for it, to take some heat off my sister. After saying I had, he came at me, with this odd look in his eyes, with his hands outstretched towards my neck. Instincively, I did what I had to to defend myself. I through the water at him and just ran the the stairs. He POUNCED at me and started strangling me. I kicked him in the testicles a few times (I guess either he doesn't have them or the adrenaline kept him from feeling pain). We tumbled down the stairs and he got me in a headlock which he claimed was to "Calm me down". Hmm, do you grab a bulls neck to call him down, do you poke a dog to make him calm down? NO! So eventually I was able to place another kick and I am assuming I hit something important. I broke free, RAN upstairs. I jammed my door in its frame so it would take a lot of force to open it, all the time hearing my mom's boyfriend saying "You're through! Your DONE!", which I interpreted as "Your Dead". Sp then I tried to get on the phone, to call either Children's Aid, the Police, or Kids Help Phone". My sister was on the phone and wouldn't get off.   And then my mother, the next morning, wanted me to wish him a happy fathers day! FUCK NO! I should've said, I just said "I am not speaking to that formfill that claims to be human". For some reason we ended up all of us going out for breakfast. I WOULDN'T LOOK AT HIM. And after all this my mom had the audicity to say "It was both your faults". Yes, I JUST BEGGED HIM TO STRANGLE ME!   So the next day at school, I tried my best to hide the bruises. I kept my head down (like even when walking, staring at the ground so it hid my neck). Then on my way to second period, my principal stopped me in the hallway and said "This is the second time today I have seen you with your head way down". So we stepped into her office, and for the first time that day I lifted my head and she saw the bruises. I scrambled to make an excuse, but nothing came. I just told the truth. She looked extremely worried and then I stayed in her office until The Children's Aid Society (which is Ontario's version of what "Child Welfare" and "Child and Social Services" are) got to my school. Then we I had a long interview with Sherri Comeau, the CAS worker on my case. We went out to lunch, tried to get ahold of my mom, nothing. It was crunch time. The CAS office closes at 4:30. If I could get a hold of my mom before they closed I would be forced into a foster placement until my mom was ready to take me back. At 4:27 miraculously I got ahold of my mother.   She came down and she said to me in the van "The one thing I never wanted was to chose between you and him, but you've made me". I wanted to rebut that, but she was too upset I thought it best to shut up. I would've said "I didn't ask for him to choke me, it is not my fault, I didn't ask for Children's Aid, I tried to hide the bruises, I DIDN'T MAKE YOU CHOSE, THEY DID" but that wouldnt've flown over too well. Something like a restraining order was put on my mom's b/f and he was not allowed near me until the investigation was finished. I had a tough choice to face. I used the excuse "the emotional trauma fogged my view of the situation" to change my story with the police. I ended up saying that "I preemptively thew the water and originally he had no intention of hurting me". I said that of course to make sure my mom didn't suffer any more than they had to. The police photographed my bruises. I kinda had the option of pressing charges or not. I decided I wanted it over with, no more drama. So I decided to NOT press charges. The investigation was closed, he was never forced to take anger management or parenting classes, and now I feel as if he is a ticking timebomb ready to go off again.   This starts bugging me often...Especially around father's day. This wasn't the first time he abused me, either. Before my mom, sister, and I had moved out to Ontario, when we were in Alberta, I locked myself in the bathroom to get away from him. When I opened the door he pounce for the neck again, and then my mom's excuse was "He was trying to shield your head from cracking on the bathroom floor"....That wouldnt've been necessary if he hadn't pounced at me. THEN HE CHASED ME AROUND THE HOUSE, yelling insults like Fatty.   The thing that bothers me most is that at times my mother says that I AM THE ABUSER. Hmm, who was the one that strangled and chased me, HER BOYFRIEND. Who was the one that played mindgames and was almost cheating on her, running of to swingers parties without telling her and against her wishes, and putting her in the hospital because of the stress that caused. And she wound up in the hospital again, and while she was in there her boyfriend tried to sell her "favourite" (I use the term losely) dog. I've said it before and I'll say it again. He is an abuser, plain and simple.  So why has this been bothering me? I don't know. It is good to get it off my chest, but the thing is my failsafe defense if I ever get attackted by a male failed. If I ever got attacked by a male, my defense was KICK THEM IN THE TESTICLES. It is plaing dirty, but what do I care, if I get out of a situation, I get out of a situation. I kicked, but nothing happened. I need better defense mechanisms, and fast. Anyone have suggestions, or comments to the situation that happened?

      Since school has ended, I have found my list of escapades, shenanigans, and adventures have slowed to all but a trickle. I actually went 3 weeks without seeing Michael or Tanya. We had our "Wild Waterworks Catastrophy" and it just slipped. I had a garage sale, and thats about it. And my plan for today? Finish this entry, sleep some, and go to a doctor's appointment. Fun! Erm, or not. Why is it that summer brings such boredom. It makes you appreciate school for its amazing ability to keep us occupied. But, as human bitchiness goes, when we are in school, we want summer. When we are in summer, we are bored. So what do I have planned for this week? Well, doctor's appointment today, might see some people on Friday, fly to Winnipeg on Saturday. But I actually had a good weekend. Saturday I met Tanya and Michael at the mall and we browsed, had a drink at Casey's, and then went to Tanya's crib (bling bling) erm, house. I DIED MY HAIR BLACK! And then we watched "Signs"....I SCREAMED MY NATURAL WHITE ASS OFF. Then I went shopping on Sunday. I got a pair of jeans, some t-shirts, and my favourite, VANILLA COKE. And then this. A boring summer.  &nbsp;  You never know what might happen. Just today I thought "I should replace this screw before it is stripped. LOW AND BEHOLD it stripped". Try to trust your instincts. When you see a baby falling from the window, instead of looking up to see if Michael Jackson is above you, CATCH THE BABY. Never kill one man's spirit. Every&nbsp;spirit you kill takes a piece from yours.  &nbsp;  Never bite of more than you can chew. And if you do, chew until it is done. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Forget that, you don't know how powerful until it is gone.&nbsp;Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.   Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.  &nbsp;  Do one thing every day that scares you.&nbsp;Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.&nbsp;Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself. Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.   Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.  &nbsp;  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.  &nbsp;  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room. Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.  &nbsp;  Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be  urlLink gone  for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.  &nbsp;  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.  urlLink Travel . Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders. Respect your elders. Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.  &nbsp;  Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85. Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.  &nbsp;  And just for "phun"  &nbsp;  "You know who it would be funny for Julie to go out with??? ANYBODY!" "You know whats funnier? JOSH GOING OUT WITH JULIE". You Know whats funniest "Julie died from relationship abuse. That hammer she was dated. She threw it in the air and got multiple deadly concussions.....He is now serving time building a juvenile hall.

      You know, it’s funny how life works. You think things are one way, and bam! They are different. I thought things were going pretty good with my dad, and then I get this shit from him! I talked to him today about the possibility of seeing him, and he said that he can’t be sure of my honesty, can’t be sure if I am just paying lipservice about starting a new relationship with him. He can’t take that chance that I will hurt him, because I have caused him so much pain already (a very close paraphrase of what he said on the phone). Bleeding eh! &nbsp;Oh well, happy Hamilton to all of you.

      Yay! After a prolonged (2 year) absence from seeing my grandparents at their home I am finally here. I flew first class from Toronto Pearson airport, and rather enjoyed the flight. I am having a good ‘ol time, and the country air is clearing out the smog! Short post, more details at a later and more interesting date.
