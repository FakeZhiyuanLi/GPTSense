       urlLink StupidVideos : Your Web-Repository of Stupid Videos   I find this site to be a  great  source of entertainment!  My step-son Chris introduced me to this site last summer and I've been back every few weeks to see what's up.  There are at least 2-5 videos I think are funny up there every few weeks.

       urlLink DogDoo.com: The ultimate harmless, SATISFYING practical joke!   I've been sending this link to friends for years.  If revenge is your thing, this site is a GREAT (and safe) way to go about it. :)  One of these days I'm gonna get the bronzed plaque and give it to a boss.

       urlLink ANDY KAUFMAN LIVES   Pretty interesting site. I personally find Andy Kaufman one of the most individual indviduals I've ever heard of. I would go so far as to say he is the grandfather of all the "reality" shows today. The man was always "on" and always in character (from what I've read), and always doing his own thing.  Living or dead, Andy Kaufman is certainly a man worth remembering.  PS: There's also a  urlLink blog  out there claiming to be that of Andy. Probably complete bullshit, but makes for interesting reading nonetheless.

       urlLink CNN.com - Three children found decapitated in apartment - May 27, 2004   It's news like this which reminds me how extreme humans can be.  In one nice tidy little flawed carbon-based package, we're both capabable of incredible good and incredible evil.  Yes, I know.  Sometimes I can be annoyingly pragmatic.  This gets me to thinking, is this a  universal  condition, or strictly human?  Guess we won't know the answer to that until we make contact with other life forms out there (assuming we're not alone in this expansive three-dimensional reality we call "The Universe").  One thing's for sure, though - I'd sure hate to run into an alien race which would be even  more  extreme than us!

       urlLink California PUC approves new telecom regulations   My experience with telcos has been more of the "it simply works, but I dread having to call in when there's problems"-type.  I must applaud the telecom industry at creating such a solid infrastructure, but do have to admit that customer service is often lacking terribly.  When I lived in California, Pacific Bell was the big evil phone company (here in Wisconsin, it's generally SBC).  Their customer service had degraded to the point that the state government had to practically babysit them.  They had to maintain a certain level of customer satisfaction or the state would levy fines and other punishments.  My personal experience, as both a residential and business customer, didn't necessarily reflect these problems, however I didn't really get involved with them until long after their "trying times".  I did hear plenty of anecdotal horror stories that'd make me cringe.  In any event, I think these new regulations are a good thing.  We simply need to start holding companies responsible for the level of their customer service.  I personally and professionaly find it astonishing that so many companies out there (not just the telephone companies, mind you) don't focus more on providing good customer service. I do believe things are starting to improve, but also believe that we still have some ways to go...  (I have the same rant about how poorly comapnies treat their QA and IT, but will leave that for another day.)

       urlLink Warner Bros. looks to reviewers to help ensure game quality   Interesting idea, I must say.  On the one hand, I agree with the developers.  Reviews can be terribly subjective, so that's not necessarily the best barometer for quality.  On the other hand, I agree with the Warner Brothers in that the long list of shitty games based on movies really needs to stop, and definately hurts the brand (at least to some extent).  In any event, I gotta give a nod to the movie studios on this one.  They are at least attempting to address the problem.

       urlLink HelpJacqui - A Story of Courage and Resolve Against Adversity - A Drunk Driver Innocent Victim's Saga   I originally wasn't going to post this in my blog.  While the story is very inspirational, I thought it too sad and many of the pictures too grotesque.  Then I downloaded and watched the PowerPoint presentation provided by the site, and I changed my mind.  We seem to need to be constantly reminded what a bad idea drinking and driving is.  Bumper sticker idea: "Drinking and driving: This shit simply has to stop."

       urlLink Fred On Everything   Seems there isn't much for me to post about lately, so I'll toss in one of my favourite sites.  I like reading Fred's columns because of his raw honesty and his intelligent take on the topics of today.  I can't say I necessarily agree with  everything  the man writes, but because he's such a fantastic writer, I come away having a fresh understanding on the point he's trying to make.  Admittedly, though, his take on things very often mirrors my own.  He's also very funny.  This is the "intelligent funny" one often gets with Dennis Miller, however I find Fred's writings to be higher on the intelligence bar than Dennis'.  Keep your dictionary on hand, though.  This man throws them 10 cent words out there like hot sauce during Mardi Gras. ;)

       urlLink CNN.com - Midwest flooding cuts power, blocks roads - May 24, 2004   Welcome to my wet, wild world. :)  I got to hear our local severe weather siren last night.  Turns out a tornado touched down just north of us.  Luckily, it was a short-lived and very weak one.  Wisconsin hasn't got it as bad as some, but I'm about ready for the rain to stop.  With reports of more severe weather on it's way (which is pretty obvious at this point if you look at any Doppler map), I don't think my wishes will come true any time soon.  Let's just hope I don't hear the severe weather siren again tonight.

       urlLink FactCheck.org - Annenberg Political Fact Check   I  just  ran across this site.  They certainly appear to be interested in facts and not necessarily politics.  They take both candidates to task on their ads, statements and speeches.  I've read a few articles/analysis' up there so far, and they certainly seem to be neutral, not necessary praising and/or villifying particular candidate.  A nice refreshing break from the political rhetoric and shit-slinging that's all too common in our Democratic process.

       urlLink CNN.com - Study: Good death as important as long life - May 20, 2004   Personally I agree with these findings, but I have to wonder, however, if they are really all that valid.  I can easily to sit back and say "I'd trade 7 months of my life for a smooth death experience" when conceivably I'm nowhere near the end of my life.  My tune may be very different when actually approaching the end of my trip on this big blue ball.  Two things I've observed over the years are: 1) You're never really 100% certain how you will react to a situation until you are  in  said situation, and 2) When it comes to actually  facing  one's demise, humans, more often than not, cling to whatever hope there may be to remaining above-ground as long as possible, no matter how irrational the reasons may (or may not) be.  Now, if these 104 people surveyed are actually coming close to facing that final goodbye, then nevermind.  I, however, suspect that's not the case here.

       urlLink South Park Studios: The Show   Speaking of South Park, if you are as much of a fan of this show as I, you'll  love  this web site.  This is the site maintained by those who  create  this show, not Comedy Central.  As such, it tends to be, well, South Park-ish: Up-front, in your face and brutally honest.  Funny as this may sound, I personally find South Park to be one of the most intellectually stimulating shows on the air today (Next to "Dennis Miller" and "The Daily Show").  That's quite an accomplishment considering they do this by using dick and fart jokes. ;)  Serously, though, these folks are absolute masters of subtlety and subtext.  I didn't realize this until I actually  thought  about the message that was being delivered.  Once I realized that, I finally understood that they really weren't being that subtle - they were throwing this information into my face.  I just wasn't seeing it because I was enjoying the dick and fart jokes too much.

       urlLink The Best Page In The Universe.   I like to check in on this site from time to time.  It's a type of commentary site, coming from the tongue-in-cheek "I'm right, you're wrong" point of view.  I don't find Maddox to be particularily hilarious all that often, but his web site is highly original, and I totally applaud him for that.  These days with people just "towing the party line", it's refreshing to see someone willing to dance to the tune of a different drummer. :)  P.S. If you tend to take things too seriously, I'd recommend against going to that site.  Let me say that if you can stomach South Park, you can stomach Maddox.  See: " urlLink Tongue in cheek ".

       urlLink NX fever seizes Intel, Transmeta, guy in local pub   It's nice to see the hardware folks step up to the plate on buffer overflow issues.  Ultimately, however, programmers really do need to start coding cleaner code.  Innovation is nice, but if it comes at the price of sloppy code, and history has shown this to be very much true in many cases, it's counter-productive.

       urlLink CNN.com - Soldier sentenced to 1 year in Iraq prisoner abuse - May 19, 2004   A YEAR?!?  I've seen ligher sentences in cases where someone actually  died !  This isn't your usual, court, though.  Those in the military do not fall under the same rules and regulations as the people they are fighting on behalf of do.  They fall under the  urlLink UCMJ , and the UCMJ is not kind to those who break the rules (unless you got some  serious  political clout).  As a citizen, I find this punishment to be a bit heavy.  As a former Navy man, I must say I'm not really all  that  surprised.  Uncle Sam is big on "tough love". ;)  Based on what I've been reading on these cases, I'd say it's time to break out " urlLink A Few Good Men " and brush up on how the "I was following orders" defense works.  I believe, however, that the movie was much more black-and-white than this Abu Ghraib case is (or will become).

       urlLink Scammer nets 4 year sentence for phishing   I don't know what's more depressing, the slimy asswipes who run these  urlLink phishing  scams or the large number of fools who will give up their personal information so easily.  As mentioned in the article, some folks would give up their passwords for a simple bar of chocolate.  If you fall into this category, please do yourself and the rest of us a favour and donate your computer to  urlLink GoodWill .  In this day and age when people are  supposedly  so concerned about their privacy, it's amazing to me how easily it is to get people to devulge their personal information.  I see it daily in my job, and the contradiction never ceases to amaze me.  (On a side note,  this  is Step 1 of most computer hacking out there, and it's called  urlLink Social Engineering ).

       urlLink Channel3000.com - News - Another Public Official Busted For Drunken Driving   This shit just simply has to stop.  Drunk driving accidents are one of the most, if not  THE  most avoidable types out there. For whatever reason, that's not enough to get people to stop drinking and driving.  Of all the sheer lunacy out there these days, this is one of the biggest - in my book.  I'm just tired of reading about the dead jogger, dead teen, dead pet, dead tourist - all because someone didn't think it was a big deal to drink and drive.  p.s. Kate Nolan is the VP of the  urlLink Dane County chapter of MADD .

       urlLink Toys (1992)   Not really sure why this movie has been on my mind lately, but it has (probably because I had to choose a favourite movie for my blog profile).  It is, by far, one of my most favourite and cherished movies of all time.  Without fail, I almost always cry during the opening sequence, which only leads to a cry/laugh jaunt for the next two hours.  This movie is one of those extremely rare ones which didn't just  move  me, but touched my soul.  Anyone who knows me knows I don't throw out phrases like that on a whim.  Anyhow, it wasn't until later that I learned that this was a "steaming pile of shit" that nobody liked.  The truth of the matter is that this movie appears to be one of those "like it" or "hate it" types.  Those who like it, like me,  really  like it.  Those that dont,  really  don't.  In any event, if you  think  you may be interested in seeing it, forget what everyone else is saying, including me, and give it a shot.

From a business perspective, their history gives me some pause.  From a technical perspective, the device has always seemed interesting to me.  Saying that, however, I'm not terribly convinced there is a market for this thing.  Time shall tell, however, and I'm gonna be sitting by waiting to see how the market reacts to this thing when it finally hits the street.....  P.S. In case you were wondering, no, I would not purchase this device were it to be available today.  To me, the cost/benefit ratio is just isn't balanced for this device.

       urlLink The Environmental Literacy Council - The Great Ocean Conveyer Belt   One of those rare events has happened.  There's actually a movie out there I want to go see.  It's called  urlLink "The Day After Tomorrow" .  It's one of those "End of the Earth" types, but with a little more "It could happen" behind it.  Alas, I digress.  The linked article in this posting is what I personally believe we need to be more concerned with.  I've read a few articles and seen a documentary on this "Global Conveyer" theory, and it looks a lot more solid, and possible, than any other  urlLink "Chicken Little"  theory out there.

Also, Linux is open to everyone who would like, and that's no more (or less, depending on who you talk to) insecure than any other operating system.  One thing for sure, if true, this will  certainly  be a VBT for Cisco.  Shareholders will not be happy.

       urlLink Playfair reborn as hymn | MacNN News   I'm no mental giant when it comes to all the issues floating around about DRM, illegal music swapping and what not.  I just wanted to get my music in a format that I use all the time now - digital.  It's  very  rare for me to use CD's.  In the rare times that I actually buy one, or get one as a gift, it usually goes directly into my computer for storage (MP3 format, of course) and future playing.  Then when I want to listen to my tunes, I either do so on my PC using iTunes, or on my Sony Clie (N760C).  My interest in music has increased in the past couple weeks.  As a music player/ripper, I just  love  iTunes, using it for everything music related.  I've been wanting to use the iTunes Music Store, but purchases through that gets you a file that can only be played through iTunes and/or an iPod.  NOT my Clie.  I can't afford an iPod, but don't really need one as I  already  have a music player.  Hymn was the straw that broke the camel's back, so this weekend I subscribed to the iTunes Music Store and made some purchases.  Hymn worked like a champ, so 10 minutes after downloading my recently purchased tunes, I was outside mowing my lawn and rocking out!  I gotta tell you, if you don't mind walking on shaky legal grounds (using Hymn) or don't mind the limitations on the iTunes-downloaded music (which, when it comes to DRM, I must say is not all that limiting), I  highly  recommend giving the  urlLink iTunes Music Store  a look-see.  In this man's mind, this is the one of the few internet companies that "Got it right" (See also: Amazon.com and Dell).  Direct link to  urlLink Hymn Project .  P.S. DRM =  urlLink Digital Rights Management .  It's basically technology that limits your use of media (how you can copy it, where you can play it, what you can do with it, etc).

If you like honest debate on topics that impact our lives, I highly recommend you put his show on your "to watch" schedule.

       urlLink Ars Technica: Nielsen Rating System points to possible deceit in RIAA sales figures   I fully believe one should pay for a product another puts time and effort into.  As time progresses, however, RIAA looks less and less like an association who's on the side of truth and fairness.  Yes, we need to get people to stop stealing music.  No, I do not believe the RIAA has any of the solutions to solve this problem.  Seems to me the RIAA is their own biggest enemy. ;)  05/17 update: I subscribe to  urlLink iTunes Music Store  this weekend and tried out Apple's solution to music piracy.  Hey, RIAA, go talk to someone who got it right, eh?

       urlLink Yahoo blocks Trillian from its networks    Trillian  is my most favouritest instant messaging program.  Yahoo's attempts to block Trillian have proved futile (there's already a patch out to fix it) and their excuse for doing so is so unbearably lame, I can't believe they used it!  They said they are trying to block third party IM programs to keep SPIM (Unwanted IM messages - i.e. SPAM for IM) down.  This is complete bullcrap as the anyone who uses IM can testify that SPIM is a minor problem (unless you're on ICQ) to say the least.  I don't think I've received a SPIM on Yahoo for the better part of the past year, and I'm on IM  constantly .

       urlLink Peter Schilling   On my path of self-improvement, one of my personal goals has been to get music into my life as often as possible.  I've discovered that when I don't get a good dose of music during my day, I simply don't function as well.  As such, I've been using a little program called  urlLink NetRadio  to listen to a  urlLink ShoutCast -based radio station called  urlLink Club 977 .  They play 80's music.  Now to get to the point of all this rambling.  Club 977 frequently plays a one-hit-wonder song by Peter Schilling called "Major Tom".  After being re-introduced to this little ditty, I recalled how much I like it.  It has a very haunting melody, and a really nice beat.  One of my co-workers told me yesterday he considered it "creepy".  I found this odd, but then again, I have never really listened to the lyrics (I'm more of a "music" guy, not a "lyrics" guy), so today I looked 'em up.  Now I had already known of another "Major Tom" from a David Bowie hit from the 70's, but had no idea these two tunes were actually somewhat "related".  So I found this web site, which gives a nice write-up on the song and it's tie to Bowie's tune.  Pretty interesting stuff.

       urlLink What To Do When Your Friends E-mail Lies To You. - FactCheck.org   Good web site in general,  excellent  article specifically.  Anyone who knows me knows that this is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I continue to be surprised at the biggest load of bullshit some of my more intelligent friends/family will fall for, simply because it was passed on to them in an e-mail.  Yes, we are not infallible beings, and can be duped fairly easily from time to time, however I would figure the old addage "once bitten, twice shy" would kick in at some point.   These  are the folks who really piss me off.  The ones, after I've pointed out the errors in the e-mails, offered my services to research these claims  for  them, begged them to stop sending them, well, they keep sending them out.  Why does this frustrate me so?  I'm not entirely sure.  Could be I'm sad to see such (supposedly) intelligent people either aren't as intelligent as I had thought, or are painfully gullible.  Maybe I get pissed due to the sheer laziness I see all around me from day to day, and this is just a perfect example of this, causing me to wade in a nasty pool of cynacism (which I fight at every turn).  To the few people who have taken my words to heart, and have turned to me to validate some of these e-mails, or performed the research themselves,  thank you very much .  You all are the bright stars blinking on the outskirts of the black hole.  You know who you are.  For the remainder who appear to enjoy making fools of themselves because they refuse to expend one iota of energy to perform the minor amount of research necessary to validate/invalidate the e-mail claims, please stop sending me your crap.  I'd rather read my spam e-mails. ;)

I do believe this finding knocks down the final excuse to invade Iraq.  OK, correction, the one excuse that held up was "Saddam is an asshole and must be knocked from power" (of course, you can use that excuse for any number of countries in the world).  Of course, this report may be somewhat flawed, but all indications show that Hussein and Bin Laden weren't the chummy buddies the Bush Administration led everyone to believe.  Generally, I must admit that I like George Bush.  He seems to be doing what he feels is right in his heart, and I gotta give him credit for that.  His administration, though, I just can't stomach, and because of that, he simply ain't getting my vote.  Yes, this makes me a "Kerry" supporter, but only because there's no other real option.    I sincerely hope there comes a day in my life where I can stop voting "for the lesser evil" and have the ability to vote for someone I actually believe in.

       urlLink CNN.com - Tenet resigns as CIA director - Jun 3, 2004   "Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out". ;)  Seriously, though, I believe this really needed to happen.  While I can't personally fault Tenet for the intelligence failures in our country before and since 9/11/01, I do, however, hold him ultimately responsible.  It's his team (the CIA) that's done a fairly piss-poor job in intelligence gathering, and it is (and was) his responsibility to keep his house in order.  Maybe he could have fixed all the problems that weigh down his agency, maybe not.  I applaud him for stepping down, though, as this will hopefully become the catalyst which will spark the changes that need to be made at the CIA.  I want my dirty, greasy, slimy, questionably ethical agency back doing the things they  used  to do so well (before the cloud of political correctness started pissing on their offices).  Face it, people, dealing in the intelligence biz is a dirty, but necessary, business.  If they aren't getting dirty, they aren't doing their job.  I always had difficulty understanding how people can forgive the garbage man for smelling like garbage, but taking the CIA to task for doing  their  jobs.  In any event, I wish the man the best and sincerely hope we, the US of A, don't spend all our time trying to villify him.  Let's fix our problems and move on.

       urlLink The Adrenaline Vault | Articles | A Plea to Game Makers to Act Responsibly   I fundamentally disagree with the angle this guy is taking.  He seems to indicate, in a round-about sort of way, that it's the responsibility of the developers to create games that are more palatable to younger players.  I find this to be complete hogwash.  The developer's primary objective is to provide a product that their potential customers  want . Should that be ultra-violent games with little plot, so be it. So long as they make a concerted effort to label these games accordingly ("Not for anyone under X years"), I have no problem with that.  Sure, this won't stop kids from getting the game, but is this  really  the fault of the developer? Should I sue RJ Reynolds because the local Kwik Trip sells my teenage daughter cigarettes? Should I blame Playboy because my son obtained an issue from his best buddy? Do I need to take Smith & Wesson to task because a local crack-head shot my cat with a gun made by them? I would certainly hope the reasonable answer to this is "Of course not!"  Like it or not, this whole "Violent Video Game" topic, so far as I'm concerned, lies  solely  on the shoulders of us parents.  These games (or at least every one I've seen) are  clearly  marked as such, so any claim of ignorance by any parents is, well, simply ignorant.  No matter how I flip this coin, it's always coming up "parent" for me.  Even if my 12-year-old son had $50 to go out and buy one of these games, it's still  my  responsibility as a parent to instill in him that this is really not content he should be dealing with at his age (the same argument goes for porn, alcohol, cigarettes, etc).  Basically, pointing the finger anywhere else is simply irresponsible and, in my obviously strong opinion, ultimately teaches our children to shirk responsibilities, blaming anyone but themsleves for the problems of the world.  Wow, I really took that one around the block, eh? ;)  PS: I was initially going to partially agree with that author on the topic of having developers create clearer delineation between "right" and "wrong". As you can probably tell, I changed my mind. Like many things these days, video games are slowly moving into the "reality" realm that sells so well. Quite honestly, in the "real world", the difference between right and wrong is often not all that clear-cut...

The BIOS is one of the first things your PC executes upon powering-up and/or rebooting, and is also one of the oldest components in any system.  Adding a little fire to the modern BIOS could make things much more interesting in the PC world.  The "nStant Media" proposed by nVidia is just one example.

       urlLink CNN.com - 'Shrek' leads record Memorial Day weekend - May 31, 2004   'Twas the  urlLink love of my life 's birthday this weekend, so we all went out to see Shrek 2. While I can't honestly say I found it  better  than the first, it was certainly as good as it, and one of the best sequels I've seen to date.  From a techie perspective, it's some of the best CG animation I've seen since  Finding Nemo .  I'd go so far as to say it even surpassed Nemo in some respects (i.e. how water interacts with objects). If you're into the techie aspects of CG animation, I  strongly  recommend you go see this movie. I highly doubt you'll come away disappointed.

       urlLink Press Release   Normally I wouldn't post a link to a press release, but I think this one is important.  What this "nStant Media" basically does is give you the ability to use your machine (most like a laptop or tablet PC) as a media player  without  having to fully load an operating system (i.e. Windows 95/98/XP/SE, Linux, MacOS).  Thus, if you're just interested in playing a DVD on your laptop, you can boot up to this nStant Media thingy and watch your DVD - instead of going through the arduous task of booting XP, logging in and running your DVD player of choice.  I'd expect to see more things like this cropping up in laptops within the next year.

       urlLink Sony presses "pause" on Clie development   As this posting states, this could be a problem.  While Sony doesn't "own" the PDA market, they were the most innovative (doing things like adding MP3 capability, colour, external memory storage, etc).  One of the most annoying aspects of Sony's innovations is that they tended to be highly  urlLink propietary .  Examples would be only supporting Memory Stick, poorly documented methods to program their PDAs, etc.  What this tended to do was cause you to  always  turn to Sony for solutions to their products, as they were the only ones providing them.  Who knows?  Maybe this will spurn other manufacturers to pick up the ball.  Sony has been the only real manufacturer innovating on the Palm-based PDA line, and I think it's high time for someone else to step into the ring.  PS: I personally own, and love, my PEG-N760C Clie. It was one of the first to play MP3 files, accepted external storage and also play videos. I'm about ready to move on to a newer unit, and must also admit I'll probably be looking away from Sony for my solution. Sony's gear is just too damn proprietary, often making the premium price one pays for it not really worth it in the long run (What happened to all those nifty memory-stick-based gadgets that were promised years ago?). One thing I definately will insist on, though, is the ability to play MP3 files. Having PDAs serve this dual-purpose just makes sense.

       urlLink Longhorn to support HD DVD   Something us techno-geeks need to keep our eyes on.  I believe the winner of this battle will determine the future of DVD players.  Current DVD technology is based on MPEG-2 compression technology (thing ZIP for movies).  While MPEG-2 was the shiz-nit in it's heyday, it's age is now showing.  With MPEG-4 (a-la DIVX and others) providing much better quality with much higher compression ratios (meaning we can now put more crap in that 10 pound bag), it's about time to move away from MPEG-2.

       urlLink Motorola and Apple to bring iTMS to cell phones   Great idea, but still at the earliest of stages.  Using music as ringtones, to me, is more gimmick than anything else.  However, if they can get more memory in those phones to store more music, bump up the battery life and put in a headphone jack, it'd bring the cell phones into the music player realm, which really just makes sense.  Personally, I like the devices which do more than one thing.  This means there's fewer things I need to drag around with me.  Too bad that these multi-use devices are frequently "jack of all trades, master of one" where they do a little of everything, but don't do any one thing well.  Hopefully as technology progresses, this will be less true.  One can only hope.

       urlLink Verizon details FTTP offering, geeks rejoice   For your information, Fiber (FTTP = fiber-to-the-premises) is the "Geek's Nirvana".  One of the reasons for this is because fiber's speed limit is MUCH higher than anything available (and affordable) out there right now.  One other reason, not mentioned in the article, that Verizon is aggressively going down this road is mostly due to the fact that they have, as I understand it, the most dark fiber out there.  "Dark fiber" is fiber that was built out, but never put into service.  Around the time of the .COM bust (1999-2000), Verizon was laying fiber like a horny college kid in a whorehouse in preparations for this type of service.  Obviously, that didn't happen then because of the bust.  But it is now!

       urlLink ICANN to Verisign: "Thou shalt not redirect"   I have to agree with ICANN on this one.  Those of you who don't quite understand the hoopla around this, let me make an analogy.  Say your local telephone company modified their service in such a way that if you call a number that'd usually ring busy would instead play you an advertisement for their services.  Not a bad idea to make use of an otherwise wasted phone call, but fundamentally changes the way the service works, potentially causing confusion not to mention the inability to tell if a phone is busy or not.  It's not a perfect analogy, but I think it gives you the gist of the topic of debate here.

       urlLink Another browser exploit: this time it's Mozilla   Well son-of-a-bitch.  I finally convert to FireFox and now I gotta patch it already.  This just goes to show that  ALL  products will have vulnerabilities.  What's the most important to keep in mind is  WHO  is taking advantage of them.  In other words, you can have the most vlunerable program on the planet, but if nobody writes anything to take advantage of those vulnerabilities, it ultimately doesn't matter (well, it does, but that's a discussion for another time).  This new vulnerability is not going to cause me to switch from FireFox back to IE.  I moved away from IE for reasons other than the fact that there were craploads of trojans/viruses taking advantage of it.  Lack of innovation, features and little stupid bugs (i.e. everything outside the "vulnerability" category) that never got fixed and probably never will are my prime reasons for moving away from IE.  Will I always stay with FireFox?  I don't know, but right now I'm very happy with it.  From a systems administration point-of-view, I do miss the tight integration with Windows (i.e. Group policy features), but that's to be expected  any time  one strays too far from the "Church of Microsoft".  I just need to work harder to maintain that integration, that's all. :)

If what Bill is saying is true, and not just a short-sighted stereotype, that can't be a good thing.

Why does it seem the hardest lesson to learn is to keep security as part of your design plan?  How many black eyes is the IT industry gonna take before they learn their lesson?

       urlLink TiVo gets FCC approval for video sharing   For my fellow TiVo-ites, this one's for you.  To put it in a nutshell, it seems TiVo owners will soon be able to transfer their saved shows to their computers (or others over the internet).  I've been clamoring for this feature since I first started filling up the drive space on my TiVo.  My current solution?  Use the TV card in my PC to record the shows I want to save, then archiving them to DVD.  Only then do I delete the show from my TiVo.  If I could transfer the saved show from the TiVo to my PC over my home network, my production time (to create a DVD) would be cut by a very large margin, and I'd have more free space (on average) on my TiVo.  Anyway, all the whining by the content owners just strengthens my belief in the fact that nothing will ever make them happy.  If these people don't get with the program and start working on some compromises, they will eventually discover that their iron-clad grasp of their content wasn't nearly as iron-clad as they had thought.

It makes little difference if you are a hard-core gamer, or consider the PC an over-priced calculator, Doom 3 is taking the world by storm.  This is a good read for those of you who would like to know what this whole thing is about, but are tired of slogging through techno-jargon that wouldn't make any more sense than Mandarin Chinese to an American.  This article hits the major points as well as providing a little insight as to what this whole Doom thing is about.  I've personally been waiting for Half-Life 2, but from what I've read about Doom 3, I may just have to pick up a copy of it first.  If the visuals are half as good as they are saying, it'll be a good purchase.

       urlLink 3DGPU.com &#65533; The State Of Game Piracy Today   I personally find the "it costs too much money" argument that some use to be, at best, a very weak one.  Just like this article, this particular viewpoint always seems to based in the (apparent) inherent greed of the companies selling their wares (whether it be software or music or movies or whatever).  I'm not saying companies  aren't  greedy, because some obviously are.  What I'm saying is that I highly doubt this is the primary motivating factor for the pricing of their products.  There are R&D costs, marketing costs, building costs, tool costs, etc.  (BTW: The movie analogy given in the comments section of that article is way off base if for any other reason than the fact that the market for movie-goers is MUCH larger than video-gamers.)  Are video games over-priced?  Part of me says "yes".  $50 is quite a bit of money to dish out for entertainment, especially after dumping hundreds of $ on a system (whether it be a PC or a console).  Then again, the popular games these days  are  big blockbusters with huge R&D budgets.  There's also the minor point that if people weren't willing to pony up the $, they wouldn't, so that tells me the games are priced at what people are willing to pay.  At the end of the day, what gets my goat about these types or arguments is this: They appear to simply be weak justifications to STEAL what you want instead of paying for it.  Yes, no matter how I examine this topic, piracy is STEALING, period.  Just because I can't afford what I want it doesn't make it right to just steal it.  Trying to justify piracy is, to me, a textbook case of self-delusion.  Don't crap on my shoes and tell me it's shoe polish. :)   p.s. No, I'm no angel when it comes to piracy, but I'm not going to try to convince you whatever I've pirated has been anything but stealing.  Also, I will NEVER use the "Two wrongs make a right" argument to justify it and/or assuage my guilt.  I've realized the "eye for an eye" mantra usually just results in two blind people instead of one, and what good is that? ;)
