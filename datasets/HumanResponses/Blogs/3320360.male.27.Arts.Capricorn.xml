      I love going out to buy new cameras. I love it even more when you're spending other people's money! That's exactly what i've been doing today; buying a camera for a friend. We traipsed around several stores... then headed back to those stores a few more times... then circled some more, returning eventually to the first shop we tried. Isn't it always the way.   Anyways, I decided that he was going to buy the  urlLink Nikon Coolpix 4500  which we got for the bargain price of Â£200. It's seems like a pretty decent camera, although I only had a few minutes to play with it. I'll inspect it fully tonight as i'm going round to his for drinks before we go to  urlLink Rock City .  Speaking of which i'd better start getting ready. Honestly, where does the time go...

      Talk about quick healing! The zit from Hell has been 'juiced' and has shrunk to a tiny red circle overnight. It's still a little raw but even now it's fading away. I've not seen anything like it before. One day it was all 'throbbing misery' and the next it's pretty much gone. Hopefully by the time I head out tonight it'll look like I have a touch of shaving rash.  Speaking of going out, i'm in a quandry. I'm supposed to be meeting with two different groups of friends tonight. One group I get to see a couple of times a year and the other lot I see on a fairly regularly. But tonight i'm supposed to be seeing them both. Now there are a number of options available. I could call one set of friends and cancel or I could arrange for both groups to meet up. Either way I have a feeling that it'll end horribly. Friends of friends either get on really well or they detest each other. I'm not in the mood for the latter one right now. Ho hum... I'll ponder it over dinner.  Oh, before I go. I've been trying to reply to the comments i've received but Blogger seems to be acting up. I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing problems.   Okay, well, there's steak to be cooked and wine to be drunk.

      I have a zit. A spot. A pluke. Whichever part of the world you're from it amounts to the same thing. It's big, it's red and it's really rather painful. I wouldn't usually devote an entry to something so trivial but this little bugger has decided to appear right on my lip line, causing said lip to balloon.  I've tried all sorts of lotions and potions to make it vanish but nothing's doing the trick. I went out and bought some 'wonder drug' which contains salicylic acid but aside from taking the redness down a notch it's hardly touched the thing.  I've not had a zit in years. Strange how I should get one on the weekend all my friends roll back into town. I'm pretty sure that it's psychosomatic. I bet the second they're gone this thing'll vanish back into the murky depths of my teenage mind.  Throbbing pain aside, i'm trying not to think about it. It doesn't make things any better when your family stare wild eyed at you, hold up a shaking hand and  croak: 'you've... you've got a big spot'.

      The toothache has subsided. Thank God for that. It means I can avoid going to the dentist for another few weeks... Oh, how pathetic that sounds. But hey, my first near death experience occurred in a dentist chair. Let's just say that I have certain issues about visiting them.  Anyways, horrible memories aside, let's focus on last night. The purpose of the visit to Kevan's place was to play some video games and drink some wine. What actually happened: I sat trying to fix his laptop whilst he passed out in the corner. It was the perfect Friday night in.  I drove home at around three am and sat watching a cartoon about a Princess and some goblins. It was all very European and very messed up yet gripping non-the-less. I eventually crawled into bed just after four and began to happily doze... Until my brother called me at five. Yes, called me by sitting on his phone whilst he was getting into a taxi.  Let's just say that I was less than happy. My happiness increased when the cats cam charging into my room at eight demanding to fed/entertained/tickled. I'm now in full-on zombie mode. Two cans of diet coke and three cups of tea later and i'm still mid-way to the land of nod.  I couldn't fix the laptop, by the way. The problem stems from the fact that the browser refuses to open up new windows. It also hates any page which contains php. It doesn't sound much but it makes browsing the web a complete nightmare. What's worse is the fact that you can't easily remove Internet Explorer.  Oh, well, i'll try again next time I go round. Which might be tonight if I can scrounge up some cash for Rock City.

      I've been suffering from a mild toothache for the past week. I've tried to shrug it off but I know I need to visit a dentist and sort the whole sorry mess out. What sorry mess? Ah, i'm glad you asked.  Last Summer I was tucking in to a rather tasty portion of Sweet and Sour chicken cooked in the Hong Kong style. I was chewing away when -cruch- something smashed against my tooth. I felt the unpleasant mix of tooth, chicken and spicy sauce in my mouth and I knew this was going to be bad.  Thankfully the damage wasn't too great. But unfortunately I was totally to blame as i'd actually chomped down on my tongue piercing. The damage was a small rupture on two of my back teeth. I shrugged it off and hoped that it'd fix itself over time.  Sadly it looks like i'll need a trip to the dentist. I feel like such a fool though. Combine that with the fact that my dentist is a total bitch and you can see why I don't want to go.  Wait, didn't I read the other day that they've worked out how to grow  urlLink new teeth using stem cells . Hmmm, I supposed I could just wait for the teeth to fall out and hope they've finished the rearch by then.   Ho hum.

       I've got my new website up and running. I decided to go for a name that's close to my heart so, ladies and gentlemen, I proudly introduce:  urlLink necronum .  I'll be scanning and uploading more art when I get the time. The problem lies in the fact that most of my work is in storage. Still, i'll do the best I can with what i've got available and given the fact that i'm constantly 'arting' i'm sure it'll be looking good in no time at all.  Take today for example. Black cat brought me two new subjects to photograph. Subject one was a rather cute robin and subject two was the most adorable mouse i've ever seen. Shame he'd killed them really. That said, it did make it pretty easy to photograph them.  Anyways, you can find the shots on the new  urlLink site .

       Well, this was rather surprising. I went to post a comment on  urlLink rach's  blog and I was asked to sign up. Then all of a sudden i'm given a blog of my own to play with. It's nice and everything. I'm hugely thankful. It's just that... well, all I wanted to do was post a comment. And. And now I can't even remember what I was going to write.  Oh, dear.   Hmmm, I suppose I could always take this opportunity to plug my  urlLink site .
