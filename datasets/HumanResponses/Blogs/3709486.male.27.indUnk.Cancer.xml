      Susan Sheybani, a Bush campaigner and assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt, was overheard saying, in response to a question posed by a reporter on job quality, "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy-or go on Prozac?"  Congratulations Miss Sheybani, you have made our Idiot of the Week.  This is real compassionate conservatism.  Check it out  urlLink here .

      An interesting  urlLink article  in AlterNet, reports on the new blackface, which is black conservative groups which seem to lack black members or have very few that they parade on the media circuits to denounce the likes of the NAACP and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, such as Project 21.  Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP, has called these organizations "make-believe organizations," and a "collection of black hustlers."  I think he has a point.  Check out the article.

      Just when I thought all Christians were anachronistic acolytes and reflections of some primitive vengeful tribal deity, they go out and impress me, or at least a small segment did.  The Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA) ordained Jay Wiesner, age 30, as a minister in the Lutheran Church.  Though this did not come without some opposition, such as Bishop Craig Johnson of the Minneapolis Synod who did not attend, and the vocal histronics of the anti-gay organization Solid Rock Lutherans, this still seems to be indicative of a positive trend among the Lutheran Church of accepting gays in the ministry and in the congregation, as professed by Retired Lutheran Seminary professor, Loren Halvorson.

      The Bush administration and Republicans love to trumpet the recent slow rise in employment as a sign that the tax cuts are working on reviving the economy.  However, this does not tell the whole story.  First, the negligible rise in employment does not reflect those people who are underemployed, or are only working part-time or seasonal jobs.  When Republicans throw out those statistics at the American public, aided by their FoxNews acolytes, they neglect to mention whether those jobs are full-time, or are part-time and seasonal.  Second, Republicans do not mention the rise in health care costs that are negatively affecting Americans and are making it more difficult for them to afford the necessities of life, even with a good full-time job.  Health care costs are currently rising five times that of inflation, and, according to the National Coalition on Health Care, by 2006 the average family will pay more than $14,000 a year for health care premiums.  This is the health care squeeze, and there are other squeezes as well on the middle class.  There is the inflation squeeze, where hourly earnings have increased less than 2%, but the consumer-price index has risen more than 3%.  Gas prices in the last year have risen 20%, and tuition at a four-year public university has risen over 30%.  Americans may have a job, but they can't afford the necessities.  There is the wage squeeze, where the new jobs are of lower quality than the millions that were previously lost.  Yes, some Americans have gained jobs in the last few months, but they are inferior to the ones they lost previously.  The  USA Today  even said, "jobs in lower-wage industries and regions are growing at a faster pace than higher-wage jobs."  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employers are cutting back on hours, and wages are not increasing at the rate of inflation.  Real earnings in June fell by more than 1%, the steepest decline since 1991.    And, then there is the jobs squeeze, where the increases in employment are much lower than historical job growth.  The Bush administration says that employment is on the rise, but during the first six months of 2004 it only grew less than 1%, placing it at the bottom 50 out of the last 100 six-months periods.  Also, Bush called June's 112,000 new jobs "steady growth," but what he fails to mention is that we need 150,000 new jobs every month just to keep up with population growth.  These are the squeezes that the media does not report, and which the Bush administration attempts to sweep under the rug with phony and misleading statistics and rhetoric.  The truth is that there is no improvement in the economy or any job growth, it is a figment of Bush's 2004 campaign push.  Check out this  urlLink article .

      In another proof of the Bush administration's unflagging devotion to the wealthy and their "Go to Hell" attitude towards everyone else, a recent  New York Times   urlLink article  details how the White House blocked a Republican deal to extend tax cuts to the middle class.  The reasoning behind this block, the fact that many Democrats supported the brokered deal, by Republican lawmakers, and the White House was fearful of extending tax cutting credentials to the Democrats on the eve of the Democratic Convention.  This administration plays politics 24/7 and damned be the people who can benefit from particular legislation if it impairs the political machine created by Karl Rove for Bush.

      Recent statements by a GOP lawmaker indicate that the only chance for the Republicans in the upcoming election is to "suppress the Detroit vote."  Michigan State Representative John Pappageorge (R-Troy), was quoted as saying, "If we do not suppress the Detroit vote, we're going to have a tough time in this election."  This statement seems to indicate two things about the GOP this year:  first, Republicans have yet to formulate a strategy for winning the African-American vote, being that Detroit is 83% black, and, second, that the only hope for Bush this year is to keep certain groups from being a significant voice in the polling booth come November.  This is just another dirty campaign trick courtesy of Karl Rove.  Check out the breaking article from  Detroit Free Press   urlLink here .

      Ralph Nader, the consumer rights curmudgeon and the most sane and principled presidential candidate in the last two presidential elections, has gone off the cliffs and falling into the Brooks Brothers arms of the GOP.  In Michigan, Nader accepted the 43,000 signatures collected by the Michigan Republican Party in order to gain ballot access, flip-flopping after initially refusing the aid based upon principle and then accepting the aid based upon desperation.  In Oregon, Republicans enlisted the help of the anti-choice, anti-gay Oregon Family Council and the corporatist free-trade Citizens for a Sound Economy who recruited right-wing conservatives to sign and gain ballot access in Oregon for Nader.  The Citizens for a Sound Economy phone script explained the need to get Nader on the ballot to "pull some very crucial votes from Kerry."  Citizens for a Sound Economy is chaired by Dick Armey and lobbies for everything that Nader is against.  Ofter Oregon, Armey and his Citizens vowed to get Nader on the ballot in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan.    It isn't just activists being provided by conservatives, but also money going into the campaign coffers of Nader/Camejo.  Initially, Camejo said they would refuse the money based upon principle, but then he changed his mind saying, "It is conceivable that pro-Bush, pro-Republicans believe we have a right to be on the ballot. We will not establish lie detector tests for people who give us money."  Ralph Nader, a once principled defender of consumers and the little guy, has now been hijacked by his own ambition and GOP interests into a mockery of a candidate.  Maybe, one day he will look back on 2004 with regret and embarassment, but, for now, we will content ourselves with looking at Nader as a pathetic GOP tool, a la Zell Miller.

      The Justice Department has recently taken over an investigation, for the U.S. Treasury Department, regarding Halliburton using a Cayman Island subsidiary to do business in Iran.  This is on the heels of a Security Exchange Commission investigation into whether Halliburton violated anti-bribery laws to gain contracts in Nigeria.  Now the question is, can the Vice-President, Dick Cheney, be tied into this as well.  Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) says, about the Iranian services, "The question must be asked: Did these possible violations occur between 1995 and 2000, while Dick Cheney was the CEO of Halliburton?"

      The Department of Labor, in an effort to be more accessible to all Americans, has started a  urlLink website  for the homeless.  This seems entirely plausible being that surfing the net is popular among the dispossessed.  It is important for the Department of Labor to appeal to this constituency being that if their plans to make huge cuts in public housing and job-training programs are fulfilled, then the homeless will only increase, dramatically.

      In an AP  urlLink article  Tim Molloy reports on the Democrat furor over California Governor Schwarzenegger calling Democrat opponents, who he accused of delaying the budget, "girlie men."  His exact quote was, "If they don't have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers ... if they don't have the guts, I call them girlie men."  Democrat State Senator Sheila Kuehl called it "blatant homophobia."  Other California Democrats said it was insulting to women and homophobic.  Assemblyman Mark Leno, a San Francisco Democrat, said it was "as misogynist as it is anti-gay."    Okay, is it just me or is the "outrage" over this remark just a tad bit over the top, either a case of political manuevering by California Democrats, or political correctness gone awry.  Personally, as a liberal and a supporter of gay rights and women's rights, I did not find the remark offensive, nor did I find it homophobic or misogynist.  I have a question, did these same Democrats express outrage when this remark was used nearly every week on Saturday Night Live?  Did they write the show, or give interviews expressing their outrage?  Or, is it that it is now considered homophobic and misogynist because a hated GOP governor has uttered the remark?  California Democrats need to shut the hell up and learn how to laugh.

      Amy Chasanov wrote a great article for the  Economic Policy Institute  arguing against those who oppose raising the minimum wage.&nbsp; She points out that it has been seven years since Congress last raised the minimum wage, even though lawmakers have raised their own pay a total&nbsp;of six times.&nbsp; Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) has recently sponsored a bill, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2004,&nbsp;that would raise the minimum wage to $7.00 an hour, but Republican lawmakers oppose the bill, saying that it will harm the working poor.&nbsp; History tells us that Republicans are wrong in this case, in that after the minimum wage was raised in 1996 and 1997 unemployment went down.&nbsp; Also, the effect on the economy would be negligible being that the wage increase will only affect 7 million workers, less than the 9 million affected by increase in 1997, one which did not negatively affect the economy then.&nbsp; The wage increase will also help employers in that it will improve work behavior among workers and lead to lower employee turnover, lower recruitment costs, lower training costs, and higher profits per employee, examples that Chasanov presents in her article.&nbsp; So, Republican opponents to increasing the minimum wage are either ignorant of the effects of wage increases among workers, or are beholden to special interests that favor cheaper labor and higher short-term profits.&nbsp; Check out Amy Chasanov's article  urlLink here .

Ditka, the Monster of the Midway, has decided to decline an entry into the Illinois Senate race against Democrat Barack Obama according to an AP  urlLink article .  The only other options for the Illinois GOP are businessman James Oberweis, who alienated many in a previous race with his attacks against immigrants, and deputy drug czar Andrea Grubb Barthwell, who is an unknown in Illinois, and, apprently in the Beltway also with House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) saying, "Don't know her."

      A recent news item by  The Century Foundation  finds that the income distribution of the United States is closer to Ecuador and Peru than to Canada or Germany.  Income distribution for the United States is 31% for the richest 10% and 16% for the lower 40% of the population.  In Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru the statistics are 34% for the top 10% and 14% for the bottom 40% of the population.  Canada and Germany show an income distribution of 25% for the wealthiest 10% and 20% for the bottom 40% of households.  The statistics are also part of a downward trend in the United States for income distribution, with it getting more and more unequal.

      An AP  urlLink article  finds that, despite the supposed improved economy, pay raises are lower than 1990s levels.  Employers are offering limited pay raises this year and next year at only 3.3 to 3.5%, lower than the typical 4% raises offered in the 1990s.  Analysts say that these modest pay raises, though higher than the rates of inflation, will be mostly eaten up by rising health care costs.  Also, it should come as no surprise that the highest percentage raises are for executives, at 3.7%, while most mid-level and low-level workers will only see 3.3% pay raises.  The wealthy take care of their own, again.

      According to an AP  urlLink article  support for a posthumous pardon of Jack Johnson is beginning to gain support, even from Republicans.  Republican Senator McCain (R-AZ) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) spoke out recently in their support of a pardon of boxer Jack Johnson, saying that the law that sent him to jail was based upon racism.  The pardon also has the support of Democrats like Ted Kennedy (D-MA) and Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-IL).  If pardoned, Jack Johnson would only be the second case in history of a posthumous, the first being Clinton's posthumous pardon of Henry Flipper, a former slave and the first African-American officer.

      A  Chicago Tribune   urlLink article  reports on the recent flurry of activity among Illinois Republicans to find a viable candidate against the Democrat nominee, Barack Obama, and they believe they have found one in the former Chicago Bears head coach, Mike Ditka.  As a lifelong football fan I remember well the volatile personality of Ditka in the NFL, and, I have to admit, it would be interesting to see if that same personality translates to the US Senate, but, I also have to admit, that this is a case of Republican desperation to win a Senate seat it, according to the polls, doesn't have a snowball chance in hell of winning.  There are, however, two problems with Ditka:  first, he has not registered to vote, and, second, he is a member of the mens-only Bob O'Link Golf Club.  We will have to see if these handicaps are outweighed by the name recognition Ditka brings to the ticket, if he accepts the candidacy.  Will Ditka follow in the footsteps of Jack Kemp and Steve Largent and walk from the gridiron to the floors of Congress?  We will just have to wait and see.

      In a  Washington Post   urlLink article leaked info shows that, in the White House staff, men, on the average, make more than women.  With the recent high profile case with Wal-Mart, and the fact that women still, on the national average, make approximiately 70% of what a man in the same position would make, this should come as no surprise.  The article says that men make an average salary of $76, 624 while the average salary for women is $59,917, which is approximiately the national average.  Now, there is a difference in that this is not due to position by position wage discrimination.  Women and men in the same position make about the same salary, unlike the common problem associated with the majority of the nation, but, the wage gap is due to the fact that men in the White House staff dominate the high-end jobs, where they receive the big salaries.  Like I said previously, this should come as no surprise, that the sexual discrimination in the workplace concerning wages and jobs should start at the very top of the nation, in the White House, and work itself down from there.  Salaries for all the 431 employees can be found at  urlLink www.washingtonpost.com/whbriefing .

      According to a  New York Times   urlLink article , an anti-war group was prevented, by Clear Channel Communications, from placing an ad on a billboard to be shown during the Republican Convention in New York City.  The ad was to read, "Democracy Is Best Taught by Example, Not by War."  Clear Channel, apparently, backed out of a leasing deal, with the group, that had been reached last December.  Clear Channel says that it has no political agenda, and only object to the bomb imagery in the ad, a cartoon like bomb is shown lit with the message underneath, but, it sures seems convenient to deny an ad that is to be shown during the Republican convention, that is also objecting to Bush's war.  This attack on free speech and attempted censorship isn't anything new to Clear Channel, however.  They censored the Dixie Chicks, only after they spoke out against Bush, and they censored Howard Stern, only after he began to speak out against Bush.  Is Clear Channel playing politics?  Seems pretty obvious to me.

      Conservatives can spin it all they want, but the final report soon to be issued by the 9/11 Commission will disprove ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.  According to a  New York Times   urlLink article , most likely will find unaminously that, contrary to White House spin, that these ties did not exist.  The report will also find that there were vast management failures at senior levels in the Bush administration in acting on intelligence reports of a possible terrorist attack in 2001.  The most clear case of this failure of the Bush administration lies in the clear title of an August 6, 2001 memo titled, "Bin Laden Determined to Attack in United States."  How much clearer can it get?    It seems as though the Bush administratin has been willing to place the blame on the CIA, and make George Tenet the official scapegoat for the inaccurate intelligence about Iraq, but I find this dubious in that the administration still vocally purports to the mythical link between Iraq and Al Qaeda, especially in regards to Cheney's idiotic insistence on this link.  CIA analysts have come forward, anonymously, that they were pressured by the Bush administration to provide evidence for a rationale of invading Iraq.  Bob Woodward in  Plan of Attack  details how the Bush administration was looking to invade Iraq from day one, after the 9/11 attack.  I still remember when Condileeza Rice made an off-hand comment that they were looking into Iraqi complicity in the 9/11 attack.  It can get more clearer, in that this administration pressed for an invasion of Iraq, and were willing to invent the evidence to justify that invasion.  And, everyone bought it, hook, line and sinker.

      CNN has  urlLink reported  recently on the downward trend of Americans in reading.  This is based on a report released by the National Endowment of the Arts, which says that the number of non-reading adults as increased by 17 million, in the years between 1992 and 2002.  In 2002, only 47% of adults read literature, such as books, plays and other narratives.  The NEA chairman goes on to say, "We have a lot of functionally literate people who are no longer engaged readers.  This isn't a case of `Johnny Can't Read,' but `Johnny Won't Read.'"  I see this everywhere, as well.  Too many children, and even adults, obtain their entertainment and information from the internet or the television, and have become intellectually lazy in the realm of reading.  They allow others to provide the visuals to the stories, rather than provide them through their own imagination.  Parents need to quit being lazy about parenting, and promote good reading habits, by reading to their children and showing them that it can be both fun and rewarding, but, when adults themselves are lazy in this category, can we really expect our children to be any different?

      You hear about it from the Bush administration, and the Republican Party, and conservative pundits from across the nation:  the "liberal" media is distorting the news.  If any sane person watches the news, or if it sickens them as much as it does me, just pick up  The Republican Noise Machine  by David Brock, and one can see how it is conservatives who are now dominating the media.  It is easy to see this simple fact by comparing the media's reaction to the nomination of John Edwards (D-NC) as Kerry's Vice President.  What do they say?  They attack his populist rhetoric designed to appeal and aid the blue-collar America that Republicans purport to serve.    The  New York Times , a so-called liberal bastion, says, "It is likely that Mr. Edwards will be dispatched to critical industrial states like Ohio to talk about jobs, as he did with such force in the primary.  We hope that he’ll refrain from falling into protectionist rhetoric in the process."  The  Washington Post  editorialized, "Mr. Edwards improved as a candidate during the primaries, but he also demonstrated, especially toward the end, an unfortunate tendency to cater to popular but irresponsible positions. Mr. Edwards was powerful, even moving, when he spoke about how the country was divided into two Americas, with one tax system, one school system, one health care system for the rich, and an inferior version for everyone else. Yet his lurch toward protectionism on trade was disappointing for a candidate who we thought knew better."    Why is this?  The fact is that as "enlightened" and "educated" on social issues, most media personalities are very wealthy, and they stand to lose if restrictions are placed on the market, in the form of protectionism and fair trade, because of the vast incomes and investments many of them hold.  So, they tend to support free traders who will cut their taxes and protect their investments.  It makes sense that, as individuals, these media pundits would be concerned with their own personal gain, but, as journalists, their news reporting should be confined to reporting the facts and leaving the "spinning" to op/ed columnists, who, incidentally, are overwhelmingly conservative.

      According to a  Washington Times   urlLink article , a Catholic lawyer has filed heresy charges against John Kerry with the Archdiocese of Boston.  This lawyer, Marc Balestrieri, conveniently doesn't include the countless other pro-choice Catholics in everday life and politics, but focuses instead on the one who is the Democrat Presidential Nominee.  Hmm, I don't know why, but I feel the brimstone breath of Karl Rove in this.  The penalty that could be applied to Kerry, if this ridiculous claim isn't shot down by the Archdiocese, is excommunication, though, seeing the medieval definitions of Catholic faith that Balestrieri apparently holds, I wouldn't be surprised to see him press for a good ol' burning at the stake.

      You might be asking, why is the Senate Majority Leader the Idiot of the Week, and there is a simple answer:  because he is a HYPOCRITE, and, yes, it needed capitalization.  Recently, Senator Frist refused to  urlLink criticize  the Vice President for making crude remarks to Senator Leahy on the Senate floor.  This isn't so surprising being that it is yet another example of Republican hypocrisy, but it isn't the reason why Frist is the Idiot of the Week.  The reason is that back in June, Frist vowed to pass a bill that increased fines on broadcasters who air "indecency," and that bill passed on the same day that Cheney left off with his verbal hissy fit.  Bill Frist seems to believe that the same standards do not apply to senators as it does to broadcasters, but, haven't they always believed they are two steps above the rest of the nation?

When this happen?  October 2001, and I am extremely curious as to why I haven't heard of this before, especially when the article I link to was first published in January 2002.  Read the  urlLink article .

      Bush, according to an AP  urlLink article  declined an invitation to speak at the next NAACP convention, an invitation that John Kerry has accepted.  I guess Bush only cares to speak before crowds of rich white men, and doesn't care to court the votes of minorities.

      Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey have two things in common, first, they are Americans, and second, they are two US soldiers who fled to Canada in order to avoid serving in what they felt was an illegal and immoral war.  Both young men are currently attempting to gain Canadian citizenship based upon political refugee status.  If they lose and are returned to the United States, they face 5 to 10 years in prison, or, the possibility of an execution for desertion during a war.  A BBC  urlLink article  presents their story and the reasons and motivations for what they have done.  I applaud them for standing up for their convictions and, if their application is approved, I hope that other soldiers, who feel the same way, will now being able to flee to Canada and escape any involvement in Bush's War.  You can visit their websites at  urlLink www.brandonhughey.org  and  urlLink www.jeremyhinzman.net .  If you visit, make sure to write them a letter of support, they could really use a word of comfort from fellow Americans who sympathize with their struggle, especially considering all the hate mail they have received from some Americans calling for their murders.  To Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey, keep up the fight!

      An  urlLink article  on Democratic Underground by Newzmaniac, shows how fans of Bush are now grasping at straws to justify the invasion of Iraq.  As more and more revelations occur, they find themselves resorting to illogic and philosophical fallacies in order to not admit that they were wrong about the war.  As the Architect of Citizen X, I will make it easy for them by doing it first, maybe they can soon follow suit.  Yes, it is true, I supported the initial invasion of Iraq.  Yes, I was duped by Bush and Powell's mythical evidence.  It took a good six months into the war before I realized the colossal mistake that the Bush administration had blundered into when, drumroll please, no WMDs were found, when all the evidence, such as the mobile WMD labs (which ended up being used for filling hydrogen balloons), were shown to be outright lies, fabrications and faulty intelligence.  I realized my mistake and was just as quick to attack the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq as I was to defend it.  Come on, Bushites, it's not that hard to admit a mistake, as a matter of fact, it is downright Christian to do so.  Step up to the plate, it's now your turn.

      A recent AP  urlLink article  details the strain and burden of the US military is feeling while fighting Bush's fictitious war.  National Guard and Reserve units are having their tours extended, and, for the first time since the Gulf War '91, the Individual Ready Reserve has been called up.  5,600 former soldiers, who were at the time enjoying the liberty of civilian life, were called back to duty to fill critical needs in the military, and thousands more are slated to be called back, as soon as next year.  This obvious strain on the US military is making the stories of the reinstatement of the draft all the more likely.

      The Bush administration, and other conservatives, constantly pointed to the so-called economic recovery by putting out the fact that 112,000 jobs were created in June 2004.  However, according to recent  urlLink statistics  that doesn't present the full picture.  Here are the facts:  Unemployment has remained steady at 5.6%, since January 2004, which implies that for every job created a job is lost.  Let us also not forget that this is the time for seasonal jobs, and that the statistic of 112,000 new jobs includes these.  Before the Bush recession began, unemployment was at 4.2%.  He still has a long way to go to correct this problem.  There is a problem with underemployment in this country, where workers are not working full-time jobs, but, since they are employed, this is not represented in the unemployment statistics.  If we take this into account, the underemployment rate is at 9.6%, which is up from 9.4% when the mythical economic recovery began.  Where is the economic recovery?  Is this a case of "fuzzy math?"  Citizen X says, YES!

      John McCain has repeatedly been portrayed as the renegade of the GOP and a maverick senator, caustically attacking Bush and other Republican leaders on everything from integrity to campaign finance reform, but McCain doesn't seem to be much of a renegade.  After losing the 2000 Republican nomination for President, he jumped in with Bush and fully supported the man whose campaign falsely accused him of fathering an illegitimate African-American child and questioning his patriotism.  Now, John McCain is being  urlLink featured  in an advertisement for Bush in which he says, "It is the great test of our generation and he has led with great moral clarity and firm resolve.  He has not wavered, he has not flinched from the hard choices, he was determined and remains determined to make this world a better, safer, freer place.  He deserves not only our support but our admiration.  That’s why I am honored to introduce to you the President of the United States, George W. Bush."  Those are not the words of a renegade or a maverick.    Even McCain's voting record shows him to be a decidedly typical Republican.  He voted YES on disallowing overseas military abortions.  Voted YES on banning partial birth abortions.  Voted YES on maintaining ban on military abortions.  Voted NO on prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation.  Voted YES on prohibiting same-sex marriage.  Supports placing the Ten Commandments in public schools.  Voted NO on allowing prescription drugs in Medicare.  Supports privatizing social security.  Supports school vouchers.  Supports the death penalty and mandatory three strikes laws.  Strong gun rights advocate.  Supports Bush tax cuts.  Strong free-trader who supports NAFTA, GATT, and WTO.  Supports deploying SDI.  Supports allowing churches to provide welfare services.  Where is the renegade?  Where is the maverick?  It is a myth created by the media, because he was a Republican who stood against the "establishment" in the 2000 Republican primary, but after he dropped out of the race he quickly rejoined that same establishment.  McCain likes the renegade maverick label, and uses his PR to advance that idea of him, but he is not a renegade or a maverick.  He is a conservative Republican, nothing more.  Here are some  urlLink truths  about John McCain.

      Today, John Kerry announced  urlLink Senator John Edwards  (D-NC) as his Vice Presidential running mate for the 2004 election.  I have to admit to being slightly disappointed.  I was hoping that Dick Gephardt would be the running mate, but, that aside, Edwards is an excellent choice, much better than the other two on the short list, Tom Vilsack and Bob Graham.

      For 45 years now, Cuba has stood against the United States, thumbing its nose at its colossus neighbor.  And, the United States still holds a grudge at the little nation which has defied it for so long.  According to the  urlLink BBC  the United States, with all the problems with terrorism in the world, has taken time to pay a little more attention to the island nation, by tightening its embargo against Cuba.  An embargo, by the way, that has yet to force the submission of Cuba to American hegemony.  This petty act harms no one, only those American Cubans who wish to visit relatives in Cuba, by reducing the number of times they can visit the nation, only once every three years, to restricting the amount of money they are allowed to spend while visiting.  Could this provoke a backlash among traditional Republican Cuban-American voters?  We can only hope so.

      Sudan is currently embroiled in a nationwide genocide, with the government fighting back against armed militias, yet, the Bush administration, which invaded Iraq to "free" the Iraqi people, does nothing.  According to a BBC  urlLink article  the Bush administration is threatening sanctions, an action they stated was not working with Iraq and was tantamount to appeasement, but, then again, Sudan has no oil or capitalist venture potential, so it makes sense that such a Mammon worshipping adminstration would play appeaser and allow hundreds of thousands of Sudanese to die.

      The Senate is preparing to consider the nominations of two court justices who are anti-woman.  An  urlLink article  on TomPaine.com details the two nominees, Thomas Griffith to the Federal Court of Appeals, and J. Leon Holmes to the Arkansas District Court.  Griffith has spoken of his opposition to Title IX, which ensures equal funding in male and female athletics, and Holmes has stated that "the wife is subordinate to her husband," and he supports an anti-choice bill that refuses the right even in event of rape.  Act now and write your senators to oppose these archaic examples of sexism and misogyny.

      I finally was able to see this movie earlier tonight, and I have to say that I was spellbound.  The way it connects Bush to the Saudis and the bin Laden family.  The way it shows the true victims of this war, Iraqi civilians and young American soldiers, is truly heartwrenching and compassionate.  The way it shows how it is the poor who defend this country and the rich who reap the rewards.  I have to say that I left the theater angry and determined to be more active in voting this illegal and immoral adminstration out of office.  Thanks to Michael Moore for making such an important and provacative film.  And, I have to say that I fully enjoyed joining in with the standing ovation that followed the film.  Go see it!

      A sad day for all film lovers, Marlon Brando  urlLink died  today at the age of 80.  One of my favorite actors, and, perhaps, the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando was the definition of method-acting.

      There are some strange parallels between Neoconservatism and Trotskyism, and it isn't that both words end in "ism."  As an  urlLink article  in  Foreign Affairs , written in 1995, details some of these similarities.  First, the "founders" of Neoconservatism, people like Irving Kristol, Norman Podheretz, Nathan Glazer, Sidney Hook and Albert Wohlstetter, were all Trotskyists in the 1930s and 1940s, and many of the younger Neoconservatives were part of the Socialist Party when the Trotskyist Max Schachtman dominated that party.  Albert Wohlstetter was a member of the League for a Revolutionary Party, a Trotskyist group founded in the 1930s.    Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, offers a concise history of Neoconservatism.  It says, "Intellectually, neoconservatives have been strongly influenced by a diverse range of thinkers from Max Shachtman's version of Trotskyism (in the area of anti-Sovietism and international policy) to the elitist, ostensibly neo-Platonic ideas of Leo Strauss."  Influential current Neoconservatives like Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz were followers of Max Schachtman, the disciple of Trotsky, and were involved in the Social Democrats, USA which was formed by Schactmanites in the 1970s.  Wiliam Kristol, editor of  The Weekly Standard , an influential Neoconservative publication, and John Podheretz, a Neoconservative writer and ideologue, are the new generation of Neoconservative, following in the footsteps of their fathers.  Jeanne Kirkpatrick was also a member of the Young People's Socialist League.  So, the founders of Neoconservatism were Trotskyists, such as Irving Kriston and Norman Podheretz, and many of the "younger" Neoconservatives, such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, were followers of Max Schachtman, a disciple of Trotsky and his protege.  What about the philosophy of the ideologies themselves?  Are they also alike?  The answer is, yes, they are.  Justin Raimondo, in an  urlLink article  for Antiwar.com in 2003, described these ideological parallels.  A core tenet of Trotskyism is the need for one-world communism, for communism to be spread outside of the Soviet Union all around the world.  Neoconservatism says the same thing, but they just replace American democracy for communism.  Trotsky said that communism could not survive surrounded by capitalism, it must spread and conquer capitalism around the world.  Neoconservatism says the same thing about American democracy being surrounded by a sea of terrorist foes.  Other similarities between Trotskyism and Neoconservatism are that both are revolutionary utopian and both are dogmatic.  Raimondo goes on to describe the evolution of Trotskyism to Neoconservatism:  "The post-Trotskyist ideology developed by Max Shachtman, who broke with Trotsky over the nature of the Soviet Union, took on a life of its own during the cold war years. Evolving from an orthodox Trotskyist, he later upheld the "third camp" – "Neither Washington, nor Moscow!" – and wound up supporting the cold war wholeheartedly, including the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Vietnam war. Devoted to spreading "global democracy," Shachtman's former followers soon coalesced into a potent intellectual force that had no trouble taking over the intellectual institutions of the Right as they made their way from one end of the political spectrum to the other. The indelible imprint of their Trotskyist legacy is a principled bellicosity: combined with intellectual aggressiveness and a capacity for bureaucratic infighting, the neocons in power make formidable opponents."  These facts are things the Neoconservatives do not want you to know, and they do their best to hide it, or dismiss it with contempt.  The roots of Neoconservatism like in Trotsky-Communism, and there is no escaping that.  I find it interesting that many of these people turned into what they once hated.

      Jonathan Tasini, in his  urlLink column  on TomPaine.com, describes another side to the Democrat senator from Nebraska, a side that includes opposition to the rights of workers.  Senator Kerrey used a common method that corporate executives have used for years, in order to stall union elections at the New School in New York City, of which he is president, and that is using legal hearings as a delay tactic.  The case of Senator Kerrey is an all too common disease among the Democrats, and that is talking the talk, but not walking the walk, especially when it concerns them.

      Mark Twain once said, "It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly American criminal class except Congress."  And, this is especially true considering a recent AP  urlLink article , that details how wealthy these public servants have become.  Out of 435 Congressional Representatives, 123 are millionaires, and in the Senate, fully 1/3 are millionaires as well.  Don't think that this is just relegated to the GOP, but Democrats are also getting filthy rich while "serving" their nation as public officials.  This is a fact that America has lived with from its inception, that the wealthy elite are the ones in power and it is the wealthy elite that consistently benefits from policy enacted by the government.  What about the people?  Do not dare to label America as a democracy, it is a plutocracy, serving ONLY the interests of the wealthy.
