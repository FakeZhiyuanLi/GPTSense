      &nbsp;Two people came and sat by me  And I ventured to ask what did they see  Their answers could not have differed more  Could both be right, I wasn't sure   From one side came, I see something bad  It's dark and it's crazy and no beauty to be had   No, said the other, I see a shining bright light &nbsp;Forced into hiding by cause of fright  That one day will shine for the world to see  It just needs the courage to set itself free   I see,&nbsp;said the dark voice, a coward, one who runs away  I see, said the other, one looking for the light of day   I see a caterpillar, small, ugly and trite  Not I, said the other,&nbsp;I see a butterfly after the night   I see an ugly duckling, wanted by none  Not I, I see a swan when the hard work is done   If I looked in the mirror which voice would I see  Or would both of them always be a part of me   The dark voice of my past reminding me where I'd left  The bright voice of the future that sees me at my best  I'll keep the one hidden safely,  lest from where I came I forget  And I'll replay the bright voice of good things to come yet

      Through the window of my mind, 'round the caverns of my heart, it whispers in and by"it is I".   In the deepest of my dreams, 'midst the shadows of my thoughts, it whispers soft and true"it is I".   Though I fight it long and hardknowing it's against my will, and the feelings deep inside I push away.   The fight is won already as the whispers call upon me, "Come meet your kindred spirit.It is I."   In the hand that touches my hand; in the thoughts that twine with mine; in the eyes that see right through me, touching deep within my soul.  All the thoughts and simple feelings  shared by two- so close- now one.  Deep within my sheltered conscience  winds of knowledge whisper through me,  "You have found your kindred spirit...It is I."

      If U r following my blog, my girlie, u know in what state I'm.  Here are few borrowed verses of a hurt lover,  You are like a soul that brought life in my being, giving happiness to my lonely plight.  your&nbsp;beauty&nbsp; can be compared to an angel's diviness, serenading my lonely heart.  if winter connotes coldness, you connotes the summer.  your smile always warm my heart, your scent reminds me of spring.  how i wish this feeling doesn't linger, how i wish it wouldn't stay longer.  for it's so hard to be in this state, loving a person who's not your fate.  as i write this ode for you, hope you will have a clue, that this feeling inside of me, is true and only meant for you.  don't worry if you feel guilty, for not feeling the same way, i'm not asking for any reaction, i just want your simple appreciation.  if this would be the fate for me, i should have to set this feeling free, for i know that in loving there is also hurting

      I can't promise you that dark clouds  will never hover over our lives or that the future will bring us many rainbows.  I can't promise you that tomorrow  will be perfect or that life will be easy.  I can promise you my ever lasting devotion, my loyalty, my respect, and  my unconditional love for a lifetime.  I can promise that I'll always be there for you, to listen and to hold your hand,and  I'll always do my best to make you happy, and make you feel loved.  I can promise that I'll see you through any crisis, and hope with you, dream with you, build with you, and always cheer you on and encourage you.  I can promise that I'll share my dreams my world, and every aspect of my life with you.  I'll willingly be your protector, your advisor, your counselor, your friend, your family, your everything.  And I believe that's what love is truly all about.

      I'm Mad about my Girl. I know I'm mad about her but not to this extent. It surprises me , I accept the fact that one who's unaffected by the power of Love is a Saint.  Niether did I&nbsp; know that &nbsp;I 've a poet dormant in me Nor did I &nbsp;know that there is a loverboy within me longing always to find his missing rib !  I'll sum it all&nbsp;with &nbsp;following verses,    Thought About You...  All day long,I thought about you.     &nbsp;   Even when I tried not to think about you,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   When I closed my eyes,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   When I opened my eyes,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   When I thought about the beauty of the season,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   When I thought about the warmth of the upcoming holidays,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   When I heard a love song on the radio,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   When I checked my email,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   Even when I said goodnight to the stars,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;   And when I slipped beneath the softness of my blanket    and gave in to the bliss of sweet dreams,    I thought about you.     &nbsp;     I just can't stop thinking about&nbsp;U !      I need to repeat a famous Quote of mine -   &nbsp;  "Love is a Painful Bliss"

       Miles Between Us...  There's a sea between us, love,and  I wish that it weren't true, for every day when I awake, I yearn to be with you.  There are many miles between us, love, though you're always here in my heart, and every night,beneath the silver starlight,  I pray for the day we'll never part

      &nbsp;    Miss You Badly...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  While I'm sleeping tonight,   you can bet that I'll be dreaming about you. I miss you badly!    &nbsp;  I spend my days thinking about you.   I spend my nights wishing you were here.     I can't wait until you return to wipe away these brown tears.   I love you, and I'm always thinking of you!    I guess I'll keep dreaming until the day that you come home to me.    Only then I will be fully complete Coz&nbsp; U r my Other half

       FOR ALWAYS, MY DARLING  Though our time in this world is short, there is a part of us that will live for always. Not the part that experiences and enjoys life,   as a form of some sort, but the immortal soul that travels the universe.    Although our time may not be very long in this life, I am happy beyond compare to be able to share with you this time of happiness and joy.   I am grateful to you for always being there,     for loving me and allowing me to love you .   No matter what happens during the time we are here, wandering life's many paths, each time I think abt U,  It brings my heart new hope and cheer.   I want you to know that I love you for Always.

      hahaha, True, These Two Days, It just came and went and ofcourse had loads of +ve   1. I read "11 Minutes" - Dunno any other novel said in such a plain - jane words but still creating such a huge impact, a must read for those who want to have a fair idea about what  "True Love"  is ?   2. Thanks to late outburst atleast I can recoup the spirit of our Team, I know I can't correct one individual but atleast I can mould the other !   3. After a longtime watched "Hang'em High" - Superb Clintwood Action Movie and Today will watch Spiderman and one of my alltime Favourites " Where Eagles Dare "   My Personal part - 50%-50% - mostly reminds me of my favourite song from  'Alaipayuthey'- " Kaadal sadugudu.."-"Tholaivil parthal Amam Enginray..... Nanaga Thotalo Mullagi Poginrai, Neeya thotalo Povaga..."    Somewhere in my mind lingers the song with my favorite line  " Zeena Isika Naam Hi!"    &nbsp;

       Friday  - Had to change my plan of travel from KMU to MDU !  somehow arranged the ticket and the delay in departure irked me a lot though  it was soothened to an extent by bucks who took care enough to pick  and drop me at the Bus Station.    Saturday  - Day started in a rather Lethargic mode,&nbsp;by the time I&nbsp;reached my  place -my dad had pressed the panick button due to the delay in my arrival, then called him and&nbsp;informed that &nbsp;I' ve arrived safe.  Elder sis called me and announced the plans for KMU is dropped, thenhad to rush to drop  my younger sis and pay a visit to doc and also for ticket arrangements, in the night hired and watched Around the Word in 80 days and Okkadu. Had a major fun time with my neice, who of late has become a major movie buff - budding prospect - hahaha    Sunday - morning rushed to get my tickets and got he medical bills from the doc and returned back and then again wandered to buy the vegetables and hired simhadri.  then had a chat with Dad. Mom was wondering abt prospects for me which I promptly shut then and there.  Then she was wondering abt the younger sis,elder sis and my younger neice.then it started to rain heavily, somehow left for the station, luckily younger niece was sleeping otherwise it would have been a mayhem.  Again in the train had annoying co passengers swtiching off the lights, etc, somehow managed and completed the novel "Da vinci Code", what a superb thriller it was.    Monday  - Train got delayed , arrived late to the office, luckily had informed abt the train scheduel prior. Somehow managed to c the day thru- throughout the day was feeling damn tired and left home early.Mom rang to knwo abt my arrival.    Tuesday  - It was a fine start reached office early, had a head start and was fully occupied in work, it was a fine day, made up my mind that I'll manage from now on to be here in office at the same time,  hopefully I can repeat the same on wednesday.

      God, What a day it was ?  Saw someone Flirting with Danger, yielding to emotions, trying to seek sanity and was almost rekindling something then came the deathblow- May be this is what God wants, Dunno if that is answer to my afternoon prayers to him, to show that individual the right direction if that has to be rekindled or not.  God, Thank you for proving once again that u r there in my life - for me and my people. All I pray to U now is to guide and take complete care of that individual who means a lot to many of the fellow humans including me.  I know U'll do that not only for me but also for that nice, kind hearted soul who might be low now. But as u made me realise Y'day on y one faces hardship, hope that the pain that individual will undergo now soothes, all I want to tell that individual is life is full of ups and downs and upto what I know is if one goes looking, one'll find lots of ups and not many downs.  God alleviate that nice of pains.  I'm actually looking forward to meet all of my folks this weekend in KMU if things r going fine. From 6 members ,we've become Nine now, dunno if Nanamma can make up this trip,God alleviate her pains too, let her not have a painful end,   Awaiting to meet my elder sis.  Order of the Day : Prayer for well being of all of mine and all of nice hearted souls on earth.  Yet another prayer from me, Keep my girl away from pain and worries, she might be taking her time to commit to me but she means my other half, keep her happy too. Hopefully she comes to me soon, sooner the better but u know what it is ! God, U know what it is !

      This is one thing which I've been wondering most of my time during my childhood and even till sometime back.  "Y do God put one to face hardship"  Then one day I got a spark when I visited the Jewellery workshop of my Dad's friend.Actually hapened to watch the transformation of gold to ornament/ Jewellery.  Even the gold u get in the first case is actually the end product due to fine tuning of various extraction process and even after that gold is subjected to Fire to make it more tensile and durable.  More the fire test, purer the Gold   I got the message, Human might be gold but in the living process he might have some impurities added to him / creaped on him due to his nature or by his surroundings , hence he needs to face the hardship to make gethimself pure, it is the purification process for human.  Now I know why I shud face the hardship coz I know whatever state I'm and whatever i'm , only the purest form of me can survive this process.  I'm will not be worried about the hardship I face, I'm happy about the degree to which I'm getting pure.  Now my heart is light, I feel a burden has moved out of me, I know y I shud face this pain and I know purest of me 'll survive this pain.  It is the pain to make me pure, "No Pain No gain!"  "Y didn't this strike me in the evening"- How come I've completly forgotten this.   Thank you God, Thanks For reminding me about this and making me realise that U r there always for me

      How can I say thanks For all the things that you've done for me Things so undeserved Yet you gave to prove your love to me And the voices of a million angels Could not express my gratitude All that I am  And ever hope to be I owe it all to thee  To God be the glory To God be the glory To God be the glory For the things He has done  And with His blood He has saved me And with His power God has raised me To God be the glory For the things He has done  Just let me live my life And let it be pleasing Lord to thee And should I gain any praise Let it go to Calvary  With His blood He has saved me And with His power God has raised me To God be the glory For the things He has done  For with his blood He has saved me And with His power God has raised To God be the glory For the things He has done For the victory He's won He's won  For the things He has done To God be the glory For the things He has done He has done

      " Today is the best day "  is the approach I've been following, but Today was full of hardships, but I learnt a valuable lesson,  "when going gets tough only tough gets going ", and also how u face the problems is what separates guys from men,   Too much of philo from a guy who asks philo evalo khilo -hahah Kavithai Max.  Well, felt embarassed to the core when my mentor ringed me and thanked me for his son, I'm not great, he is a greater human coz he is architecting lives of umpteen number of students daily, atleast 300 in a day,  How many days had I disturbed him in his sleep and asked for clarifying my doubt, how any times had he given me directions to take up my life, God give him long life to architect much more students.  He is a Sincere and honest teacher, he never even got a penny from me for all this, he is a kind hearted soul, God let him not face hardship.  I remember a dialoguefrom a recent Telugu trash movie but the verses r really true,  a millionaire hardly helps in creating / making another millionaire ( except for blood relationship ) but an educated person can create / make 1000 other educated persons , who else it can be other than teachers .    "Matha, Pitah, Guru, Deivam "   - old saying    how true it is ?   Parents  play a major role in one's life by providing proper education and comfort along with love filled care.   Teacher  - tutors, guides, moulds the life of the student    God  - always guides the path chosen by him for any individual.  what I wud 've been had I not had these persons in my life , sure God is always there for the needy but will I ever be able to knwo about hte living Gods- Parents and teachers - Dunno.  Whatever I'm today is due to them and whatever I'll be will always be due to them.  Max - talks abt senti but these are the essence of life which makes life spicy.     A Valentine Ode to My Parents    V = You are the Very best in all the world to me.     A = All the times you helped through good and bad times -- and still are.     L = Love for me, you have biven unconditionally, all my 25 years on God's earth.  Love you both without any questions. Your love for me and you makes my love for you and others blossom like a new flower in a garden, on a summer's day.    E = Everything you touch and do makes life worthwhile, to live, makes me a better person, because of you.     N = Nobody could ever replace my perfect parents, God sent on earth especially for me.     T = Two fine teachers who taught me that love is the most important part of my life.   You taught me to walk, tie my shoes, read and have self respect, pray the way I still can. Everyday you taught something new, and taught me to love my enemies, and my neighbors, as myself. Nobody can ever take that away from me. You gave me so much from teaching, that no school teacher has ever done.    I = I love you so much, you are important to me. I will try my best to take care of you.     N = Nicest parents ever. I've got the best parents in the world.     E = Everything you gave up, so I could have the things I needed.   Even though you needed things, you put us first. Our home was meek and cozy, but it was home, and still is, whether I live in it or not. I can still feel you here with me. I close my eyes, and see, smell and hear the five of us. You are my everything always and forever.   My loving mind and heart for you both, gave my mind to write this, with God at my side.  Love, your Son    Ode to Great Teachers    A grain of truth becomes the bread of life,  the hidden mist in your sage words.   "What is the difference between butterflies and flies?  between birds & bugs? between discourse and discord?"  And something about freedom, something about what is not.   How quickly what you say becomes important.  How important what you say becomes to me & butterflies, freedom & discourse.   More important is that I now know the difference  between art & artifice  between candor & candidate  between stealth & stealing.   This knowing is my garb, Something the mist of your words helped fashion.  Cover & spear, lion's mane, coil and recoil.   Each grain from that truth, from that loaf of bread you offered  combs through sands, pebbles & stone,  winces & denounces the feeble vision, so plentiful.  Teaches instead of quiet wisdom & good spirits & the simple happy song   Teach us yet, why is it so rare?  - Ur student     ODE TO GOD - Max'll upload sometime in near future

      Am I ?  Yeah to an extent,  Last night post my dinner rushed to visit this guy who was sick only to know he had been to his hometown and he was down due to flu , felt like God can't I take care of him at my place if niot for him atleast for his dad.  Felt bad coz for even someone whom I've known for ages, I'm not of any use or he thinks I'm not of any use.  O.K, I'll try my level best to prove I'm still what I was and I'll be  , rest God will take care.  Well now the happy part, completed the novel "No Comebacks" at last, now I'm resolved to read atleast few pages before I go to sleep.  I've a Dream, I have dream.  I've been living with that, I'll make it happen, this is my mantra, for those who want to know what it is , pls check my previous block.  Max is too good to spell that.

      Hiyo,   Its yet another blog for me to start, hope atleast this time I'm able to maintain it.   It has been a habit for me to write diary (which I've been doing for ages), but of late I've been quite irregular to that,(may be I'm not too comfortable with my Current abode but my lethargicness is also another reason).   My relationship with my girl is like a beautiful bubble now a days,u get close to it , thats it , it bursts.   I miss her a lot and she misses me too, then what is the problem ?   I like her to the core and admire her also to the core, She likes and loves me to the core but don't want to commit.   Dunno when can I've a breakthrough, but I know I'll someday and If I'm marrying anyone that is she !   Think this is o.k for today, will post more on the forecoming days.

      My blog can never be complete without the following favourite songs of mine,    Love Of A Lifetime ( Fire House )   I guess the time was right for us to say, We'd take our time and live our lives together day by day. We'll make a wish and send it on a prayer, We know our dreams can all come true with love that we can share.  With you I never wonder, will you be there for me? With you I never wonder ... you're the right one for me.  I finally found a love of a lifetime, A love to last my whole life through. I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love of a lifetime.  With every kiss our love is like brand new, And every star up in the sky was made for me and you. Still we both know that the road is long, But we know that we will be together because our love is strong  I finally found a love of a lifetime, A love to last my whole life through. I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love of a lifetime.  I finally found a love of a lifetime, A love to last my whole life through. I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love of a lifetime.  I finally found a love of a lifetime, I finally found a love of a lifetime, I finally found a love of a lifetime, Forever in my heart, I finally found a love, .......................................... of a lifetime.    I Found Love (When I Found You)   I found love when I found you When I look in your eyes, I know it's true  My life was lonely, Yeah broken and blue Then I found love, when I found you.

            Well this is a fun one mailed to me from oen of my  friend who has been following my blog and wants me to publish this  one.       A  foreword from me : " I partly agree and mostly disagree " with this stuff. But  if U find it useful well and good.       Here it starts       RULES FROM MEN:     We always hear "the rules" from  the female side. Now   here are the rules  from the male side. These are our     rules! Please note these are all  numbered "1" ON   PURPOSE!     1. Sometimes we are not thinking  about you. Live with   it.     1. Don't cut your hair. Ever.  Long hair is always more attractive than short hair. One of the big reasons guys  fear getting married is that married women always cut their hair.     1. Shopping is NOT a  sport.     1. Crying is  blackmail.     1. Ask for what you want. Let us  be clear on this one:     Subtle hints do not work! Strong  hints do not work!Obvious hints do not work!     Just say it!     1. We don't remember dates. Mark  birthdays andanniversaries on a calendar. Remind us frequently   beforehand.     1. "Yes", and "No" are perfectly  acceptable answers to   almost every  question.     1. Come to us with a problem only  if you want help   solving it.     That's what we do. Sympathy is  what your   girlfriends are for.     1. Anything we said 6 months ago  is inadmissible in an argument.     In fact,all comments become null  and void after 24   hours.     1. If you think you're fat, you  probably are. Don't   ask us. We refuse to  answer.      1. If something we said  could be interpreted two ways;and one of the ways pisses you off,--- we meant  the      other one.     1. It is genetic for us to look  at women. Just deal   with it.     1. You can either ask us to do  something or tell us   how you want it done.  Not both. If you already know     best how to do it, just do it  yourself.     1. Christopher Columbus did not  need directions, and   neither do  we.     1. ALL men see in only 16  colours, like Windows   default  settings.     Peach, for example, is a fruit,  not a colour.     We have no idea what mauve  is.      1. We are not mind readers  and we never will be. Our   lack of  mind-reading ability is not proof of how       little we care  about you.     1. If we ask what is wrong and  you say "nothing," we   will take it as  truth.     We know you are lying, but it is  just not worth the   hassle.     1. When we have to go somewhere,  absolutely anything   you wear is fine  -Really.      1. Don't ask us what we're  thinking about unless you   are prepared to  discuss such topics as design of the       new V6 engine,  the shotgun formation, or monster    trucks.     1. You have enough clothes...You  have too many shoes.     1. It is neither in your best  interest or ours to take   the quiz  together.     No, it doesn't matter which  quiz.     1. I'm in shape. ROUND is a  shape.     Thank you for reading  this;

           &nbsp;      It has been ages  since I updated my Blog - I've a lots and lots of stuff to write and I've lots  and lots of stuff&nbsp; I shud refrain from writing. Am I going to strike a  Balance or what am I going to do ?            &nbsp;      Well , I'll be  as truthful I can be and I still will be as eluding as I've to  be.            &nbsp;      Last two weeks ,  I'm not me . There used to be a time I thought can't a the days be Saturday  and&nbsp; Sunday and was cursing why were 5 other days in the week spoiling my  mood.             &nbsp;      But that is a  part of history.       I now hate weekends. May be I'm having a hangover,  pondering over the past without moving ahead with  reality.            &nbsp;      I don't want to  be obselete. That will what I'll become if I continue in the same way. I've  planned my next two weeks and it is Jampacked. I'm fine with it. I know if I  could handle it during next two weeks, I can do that  anytime.            &nbsp;      For all those  who r wondering on what I'm blabbering about, All I need to tell U is I'm having  Nightmares.            &nbsp;      I know the cause  , I know the Solution but I can't implement it and I'm in a helpless  position.            &nbsp;      All I need is  little patience which I'm finding it hard to have.            &nbsp;      I never rush  things though I'm aggressive but I've 6 more months to spend.              &nbsp;      I know it is  only 6 months for many of u but believe me I'm the guy with mindset of enjoy ur  stay in this life by living every moment but still I find it  tough.            &nbsp;      I'm not afraid  of pain or trauma I undergo.            &nbsp;      I don't want  anyone sympathyising with me , I just want to say it pains.              &nbsp;      people  say&nbsp;Braveness is holding ur emotions.            &nbsp;      But upto my  limited knowlege and experience , I say Braveness is knowing u r weak and  expressing it when&nbsp;it hurts / pains , Brave r those who accept their  weakness , at the same time&nbsp; confront them and&nbsp; living ahead with  them, That is what Braveness is.            &nbsp;      I'm now in the  process of becoming Brave and I know I'm brave  !

      Only  thing that has been bothering me for much more time during past two weeks  has given me enough time to think over mine.  At this stage, I've two options,  1. I can come out of this with a little more heartbreak than I have now.  But is this what I want after being so much involved ?  Rejected.  2. I know she is the one - how to make her realise I'm the one.  I need to rekindle it by being dettached. It might be a success or it can also be the other.  So a couple of rules before I go, what do you think?  1) No expectations. I am not expecting this effort to rekindle or solve anything. It is just what it is a relationship with someone I really enjoy being with.  2) No baggage. I am leaving every flaw, criticism, pain, and heartache at home. No way am I bringing it on this one as there is no point.  3) No begging. This is not a time to plead my case or in anyway convince her that I am the one for her. The only way she can learn that is through my actions and seeing me as fun again.  4) No tension. This can only make things worse. There is no point talking or brooding about the relationship or lack thereof while there.  5) No return . I am treating this  effort  as if we were coming back to separate lives (a amorous rendezvous if you will). This way I have no expectations of continuation of what happens on this one.  Max will now play the game according to the rule set.   For anybody who is worried about his/her other half's past - a piece of my mind to U    "At what point is someones past too much?" Thats easy. The point that you can't handle it. Set up a scale in your head. On one side, put the way you feel about the things you like about the person. On the other side, put the way you feel about the persons past. If you can't find a way to balance the two, or make it so the good of the person means more to you than the persons past, then you probably need to leave them alone. All some time , In any case, you don't have to decide now. You've still go time to get to know this person more. The solution will become more and more apparent the better you know her/him ...  My way thoughts - It's unfair to expect or demand someone to behave the way we would like them to, to really love is to accept and appreciate who they are, to acknowledge their minor faults (not abuse/infedility) and that they are human.  The question from me to U -  which is more important to U - Is it more important 'to be in love with' or 'to love' each other?  To love: is to care about someone in ways that you devote yourself to that person.  To be in love: is to feel your heart beating because you are attracted (physically or spiritually or by whatever ways) to that person.  To be in love describes the excitement, passion, and sense of worth that a person experiences when they are involved with someone. It is a personal experience.  To love someone means that you give them care, concern, friendship and affection willingly. You respect them, understand that they are as human as you and do make mistakes, but that they are a good, capable, responsible person whom you enjoy spending time with. Your affection does not wane with distance, and you do not grow bored of them with time. Neither do you idealize them.  Max thinks he has given more of a lecture / advice and time to stop !

      1. Guys don't actually look after good-looking girls. They prefer neat and presentable girls. 2. Guys hate flirts. 3. A guy can like you for a minute, and then forget you afterwards. 4. When a guy says he doesn't understand you, it simply means you're not thinking the way he is. 5. "Are you doing something?" or "Have you eaten already?" are the first usual questions a guy asks on the phone just to get out from stammering. 6. Guys may be flirting around all day but before they go to sleep, they always think about the girl they truly care about. 7. When a guy really likes you, he'll disregard all your bad characteristics. 8. Guys go crazy over a girl's smile. 9. Guys will do anything just to get the girl's attention. 10. Guys hate it when you talk about your ex-boyfriend. 11. When guys want to meet your parents. Let them. 12. Guys want to tell you many things but they can't. And they sure have one habit to gain courage and spirit to tell you many things and it is drinking! 13. Guys cry!!! 14. Don't provoke the guy to heat up. Believe me. He will. 15. Guys can never dream and hope too much. 16. Guys usually try hard to get the girl who has dumped them, and this makes it harder for them to accept their defeat. 17. When you touch a guy's heart, there's no turning back. 18. Giving a guy a hanging message like "You know what?!..uh...never mind!" would make him jump to a conclusion that is far from what you are thinking. 19. Guys go crazy when girls touch their hands. 20. Guys are good flatterers when courting but they usually stammer when they talk to a girl they really like. 21. When a guy makes a prolonged "umm" or makes any excuses when you're asking him to do you a favor, he's actually saying that he doesn't like you and he can't lay down the card for you. 22. When a girl says "no", a guy hears it as "try again tomorrow." 23. You have to tell a guy what you really want before he gets the message clearly. 24. Guys hate gays! 25. Guys love their moms. 26. A guy would sacrifice his money for lunch just to get you a couple of roses. 27. A guy often thinks about the girl who likes him. But this doesn't mean that the guy likes her. 28 You can never understand him unless you listen to him. 29. If a guy tells you he loves you once in a lifetime. He does. 30. Beware. Guys can make gossips scatter through half of the face of the earth faster than girls can. 31. Like Eve, girls are guys weaknesses. 32. Guys are very open about themselves. 33.

Guys really admire girls that they like even if they're not that much pretty. 37. Your best friend, whom your boyfriend seeks help from about his problems with you may end up being admired by your boyfriend. 38. If a guy tells you about his problems, he just needs someone to listen to him. You don't need to give advice. 39. A usual act that proves that the guy likes you is when he teases you. 40. A guy finds ways to keep you off from linking with someone else. 41. Guys love girls with brains more than girls in miniskirts. 42.

Guys think too much. 46. Guys' fantasies are unlimited. 47. Girls' height doesn't really matter to a guy but her weight does! 48. Guys tend to get serious with their relationship and become too possessive. So watch out girls!!! 49. When a girl makes the boy suffer during courtship, it would be hard for him to let go of that girl. 50. It's not easy for a guy to let go of his girlfriend after they broke up especially when they've been together for 3 years or more. 51. You have to tell a guy what you really want before getting involved with that guy. 52. A guy has to experience rejection, because if he's too-good-never-been-busted, never been in love and hurt, he won't be matured and grow up. 53. When an unlikable circumstance comes, guys blame themselves a lot more than girls do. They could even hurt themselves physically. 54. Guys have strong passion to change but have weak will power. 55. Guys are tigers in their peer groups but become tamed pussycats with their girlfriends. 56. When a guy pretends to be calm, check if he's sweating. You'll probably see that he is nervous. 57. When a guy says he is going crazy about the girl. He really is. 58. When a guy asks you to leave him alone, he's just actually saying, "Please come and listen to me" 59. Guys don't really have final decisions. 60. When a guy loves you, bring out the best in him. 61. If a guy starts to talk seriously, listen to him. 62.

Guys like girls who are like their moms. No kidding! 70. A guy has more problems than you can see with your naked eyes. 71. A guy's friend knows everything about him. Use this to your advantage. 72.. Don't be a snob. Guys may easily give up on the first sign of rejection. 73.. Don't be biased. Try loving a guy without prejudice and you'll be surprised. 74. Girls who bathe in their eau de perfumes do more repelling than attracting guys. 75. Guys are more talkative than girls are especially when the topic is about girls. 76. Guys don't comprehend the statement "Get lost" too well. 77. Guys really think that girls are strange and have unpredictable decisions but still love them more. 78. When a guy gives a crooked or pretentious grin at your jokes, he finds them offending and he just tried to be polite. 79. Guys don't care about how shiny their shoes are unlike girls. 80. Guys tend to generalize about girls but once they get to know them,they'll realize they're wrong. 81. Any guy can handle his problems all by his own. He's just too stubborn to deal with it. 82. Guys find it so objectionable when a girl swears. 83. Guys' weakest point is at the knee. 84. When a problem arises, a guy usually keeps himself cool but is already thinking of a way out. 85. When a guy is conscious of his looks, it shows he is not good at fixing things. 86. When a guy looks at you, either he's amazed of you or he's criticizing you. 87. When you catch him cheating on you and he asks for a second chance, give it to him. But when you catch him again and he asks for another chance, ignore him. 88. If a guy lets you go, he really loves you. 89. If you have a boyfriend, and your boy best friend always glances at you and it obviously shows that he is jealous whenever you're with your boyfriend, all I can say is your boy best friend loves you more than your boyfriend does. 90. Guys learn from experience not from the romance books that girls read and take as their basis of experience. 91. You can tell if a guy is really hurt or in pain when he cries in front of you! 92. If a guy suddenly asks you for a date, ask him first why. 93. When a guy says he can't sleep if he doesn't hear your voice even just for one night, hang up. He also tells that to another girl. He only flatters you and sometimes makes fun of you. 94. You can truly say that a guy has good intentions if you see him praying sometimes. 95. Guys seek for advice not from a guy but from a girl. 96. Girls are allowed to touch boys' things. Not their hair! 97. If a guy says you're beautiful, that guy likes you. 98. Guys hate girls who overreact. 99. Guys love you more than you love them if they are serious in your relationships.
