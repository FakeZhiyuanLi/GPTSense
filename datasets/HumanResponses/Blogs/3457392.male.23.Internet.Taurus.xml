      Have cockles become the new cocaine? Are they the new designer drug of choice? What  it all about? There have been turf wars, the bringing in of illegal migrant workers so bosses can cash in on "the high prices paid by shellfish processors". Why the hell do they pay so much, I don't get it. I'm guessing this is all a bit like the caviar thing.

      It's all about that Sven chappy isn't it. Okay so fair enough he slept with some secretary, surely that's more an issue between him and his misses but who am I to complain? What really gets my goat is that the BBC, who I would usually respect, chose last night to title a segment about the 'Sven Affair' as the FA crisis. Now I ask you is it really fair to use the word crisis in the same sentence as the Football Association? Thousands of Iraqis are dead following the US-British lead invasion and we chose to call some sordid affair by a Swedish Football coach a crisis, funny old world, ain't it?

      Essentially a good Christmas, had a lovely time at my parents place with the Missus but unfortunately contracted some really nasty cold which has caused me no end of suffering for the last few days. I seem to be getting over it now though so it's all go for new years eve partying in Scruffies. Spent yesterday putting up shower fittings in the bathroom which all look very good and haven't fallen down yet, makes quite a difference to be able to have a proper shower in the mornings(:smile:) So a belated seasons greetings to all and hope everyone had a lovely time.

      Me missus has started working in Scruffies which is the pub over the road from where I work. This is great because I am now able to see her on a much more regular basis. I can't quite remember if much else has happened since I last posted, been trying to save money quite a bit to pay for Christmas. Has a nice weekend in Northampton seeing me missus' folks and family as well as having a few nice beers in a little pub. Unfortunately got stuck in Coventry for 45 mins in the freezing cold due to Virgin Trains not quite cutting the mustard

      Decided to come back from me holiday after all, damn stupid decision it appears as everything is still as crappy here as I left it. Reading still sucks and so does work, doesn't it always though? Did have a fantastic week away though. Lot's of relaxing and real fires. Had a few walks about the local area which was nice but also spent a lot of time in the cottage just enjoying being away for a while. The place I booked the cottage from was www.cottagesforyou.co.uk, I really do recommend them on price and quality. Apart from that everything else is running along smoothly, getting ready for xmas with the present buying and cards and all. Seems to get earlier every year. Take care all and wrap up warm.

      So much has happened in such a little time, I shall therefore give up on any chronological process and mention things as and when they pass through my mind. Moved all of the missus' stuff out of her old flat and took some of it all through London back to my place which has now created a wonderful culmination of 'our' stuff which is nice:(:smile:) Work on the whole has been a bit hectic with lots of meetings and 'communicating' eurgh! Never has been my favorite part of the job, maybe I am just a cube junkie at heart. Still I do have a job and in that I am grateful. New years was not too bad but me missus was working all night 'till 2 in the morning and we only got half an hour to see in the new year together, I think I may have missed it as I was too concerned with the game of tonsil tennis being played(:wink:) Now all I need to do is resist the temptation to buy a new hard drive an I'll be able to eat for the next month as well. Happy days.

      Happy 22nd to  urlLink   me missus. Hooray! I went to the circus, I went to the circus(:biggrin:) It was great, they had a bloke that had four bricks broken over his head with a sledge hammer, crazy. Plate spinning a plenty and lot's of glitzy costumes. A fantastic night to be sure. Currently I'm working on getting out of Reading, maybe back to the coast but current job location in hindering this process at the moment. Looks like I'll be moving into another flat or something similar in Reading with me missus for the short term at least.  Should be off on a nice holiday soon with me missus, as her mum has been extremely generous and given us a holiday for two anywhere we want, we're all going on a summer holiday:)

      Wow, seems like ages since I last posted. Me and me missus are now official moving in together. We've found a little one bedroom flat that we like and should hopefully be in the on the 5th of April which is next weekend. Can't wait to be honest, it's going to be so nice to have our own place with our own stuff and everything. I've seen some really nice shelves that I'd like to get and we've already got a really comfy bed that me missus had from when she was living in Colchester. Work is plodding along as it does, nothing too exiting but keeps the bills at bay:) Anyways, I think that's it for now. Take it easy.

      I passed my theory test, I passed my theory test. Having done no revision at all I will assume that lady luck was on my side. Now all I have left is a quick practical test and then I'm off to buy a car... Or wait for someone to generously donate one?

      Off to see the folks for the Easter weekend. Excellent chance to get away from reading with the misses and see the sea. Weather is supposed to be okay but I'm sure it'll rain at some point, what with the bank holiday and all(:smile:)

      Everything is finally moved into the new flat. Although it was only three hours moving all of our possessions in it felt like an eternity due to the stupidly hot day. Although I did have an extremely tasty shoulder of lamb in rosemary and mint sauce at a pub just outside Theale. I've also bought many gadgets like my new T68i mobile phone with an infrared link and desk stand, and two new cordless digital home phones. Splendid :)

      Yip, yip! Got the flat, picked up the keys this morning and should be moving in all our stuff at the weekend. Still got lots to sort out like changing all my adresses and setting up all the bill payments but at least now we officially have the flat. It's also a really sunny day and friday all at the same time which to me says beer drinking in the sun but unfortunatly work must come before beer drinking:( I do love the sunshine, seems to take so long for summer to come round that I forget how loverly it can be.

      I did it, I did it. I finally passed my  urlLink   driving test yesterday. I am so unbelievably chuffed I can't explain, and I only got 6 minors which is pretty good really. Me misses coked me a steak dinner to celebrate with a bottle of wine and a  urlLink   chocolate cheescake for dessert. On the test I did drive over a cycle path but apparntly I saved myself by checkingthe mirror before I did so I am now legal to drive by myself on the roads. Should come in handy in Australia as I'm hoping to buy a cheap run around while I'm out there. Anyways I gotta go do the washing.

      So I've got my driving test on Friday, 2:30pm if you want to make sure you're off the roads in time:) I'm not feeling to stressed at the moment but that is likely to change by Friday morning. I remeber I was really nervous for my last test which was over three years ago now, I screwed up parking and took a wrong turn so I think it shouldn't be too hard to improve on. I've taken the whole day off work so I'll be taking it easy up until test time, I always drive crap when I'm stressed. Australia plans continue to roll forward, not much to report really, should be handing notice in on our flat soon though. Only a potential 2 months to flying time which seems a bit short really, I'm sure we'll do it. Enough babble, I shall leave you now.

      Australia here we come:) Me and me misses have decided that we're going to get out of the rat run by going to Australia for a year. We've only just started planning but it certainly looks like it may happen and best of all it may happen really soon. We're currently planning to leave at the beginning of October as that's when we can leave our current flat and apparently it's a good time for flights. Me misses already has a years working VISA and I'm waiting on my passport to apply. Still got loads of things to sort out like the flights, travel insurance and the money we'll need to live for the first few weeks but we'll get there. I'm going to be selling a load of old bits and pieces and we'll both be living on a shoe string for a while to save up enough cash. We're planning on going to  urlLink   Melbourne to start with as I have an uncle who lives near their and I think most of his family is scattered around Victoria in general. Money in the bank so far for the trip is at &pound;900 but I'll keep you updated on that one. Lot's to get excited about so I'll keep posting as and when things get done.  Yay,  urlLink   Kangaroos:)

      Well, me and me misses spent the weekend up at Hollowell Steam Rally near Guilsborough. We got down there on Friday straight after work and got a lift from Julie (Marions mum) from Banbury back to Guilsborough and then off we went to the Rally. To be honest I think I was mostly in shock at the size of the damned thing, it was massive. Classic cars,  urlLink   steam engines of all descriptions, tractors, beer tents,  urlLink   huge horses, stalls galore, a mobile bell tower and way too much more. Ended up in a pub Friday night for some Thai food in a lovely little country pub, strange combination I thought but very pleasant. Saturday was to be the day of much, much sleep. We lounged around until about midday, then finally decided to rise and have a fry up and get down to the field. Just when I thought I'd got the idea about the size of this rally we're greeted at the entrance by a helicopter giving people rides, utter, utter madness! After a few beers and a bit of a wander we got back to the house and passed out until everyone else was back. Wow, sleep, how I have missed you. Sunday was another lazy day at the Rally until about five then it was off to the station and home in time for a pint in the Hobs before bed time. Lovely.

      So I suppose that yet again it's been a while since I posted. I suppose I have been quite busy of late but not with a whole lot to show for it. I was on holiday in Newquay last week which was great, went surfing and had a look at the Eden project. Could have done with a bit more sleep I think but overall it was worth it I think. Got some great pictures too which I may try to get up on this blog thingy if I get round to it.  Reading, reading you do my f*cking head in. Oh so true, it's pissing it down outside with only 15 minutes till I get to go home, how typical. Reading does really look depressing when it rains and worst of all I can always see it coming from miles away through the office window which looks out over the Thames Valley.  Anyways I've got a driving lesson in this rain to look forward to.

      I handed in my notice at work on Tuesday which now means I have only three weeks left at work from Thursday. Not too long at all really, then it's only another week after that until we fly out, certainly brings it into perspective a little more. As for the Oz plans they're all still going ahead, nice and smoothly. I got my IDP (International Driving Permit) yesterday which is another box to tick, looks kind of like a ration book though so I'm not that impressed. I also got myself a new phone at the weekend as all this saving makes a man hungry for gadgets. It's got a camera on it which actually takes some pretty good pictures so I'm sure they'll be floating around at some point. Had a lovely day with my parents on Sunday, really, really lovely. We went up to Prospect Park for a bit of a walk and then had lunch at the Mansion, we even managed dessert, mmmm baked cheesecake. Really relaxing and had a lovely chat, wish I could fit them in my suitcase and take them to Oz with us. Anyhow, that's about all for now. Bye.

      We now have our  urlLink   tickets for Australia, flying out on the 27th September. Well, they're not exactly the tickets, they're e-tickets which are basicly just receipts so you can pick up the real tickets when you get to the Airport. Still it's a really nice feeling to hold them in your hands. Insurance is also all paid for and should be arriveing in a few days, still waiting on my driving licesnse though and I still need to get an international license as well.

      It's so damned hot everywhere and it's been like this for ages. I've heard tell of temperatures of 35 or more. Me, me misses and Si tried to go out over the weekend and I actually thought we might start to melt. It took me over an hour to drink a pint of larger which is very, very wrong indeed. We did however brave the heat again to make it to the cinema to see Pirates Of The Caribbean which was great for two reasons. One, the film was actually quite good and two, the air conditioning was heavenly. I've heard tell there may be some thunder storms soon so here's hoping it'll all be back to normal by next week.

      What a fantastic weekend. After work on Tuesday we went up to stay with Marion's Dad and Marilyn in Glouster. Had a fantastic Indian in this little restaurant right next to the train bridge. Would have been perfect except for the guys who insisted on serenading us with numbers such as "You Lost That Loving Feeling" and "Bohemian Rhapsody". The next day was a trip down to see Marjorie (Marilyn's mum) who is one of the nicest people I've met in ages. Se also has one of the fattest cats I've ever seen:) After a massive lunch in a nearby pub we went into Glastonbury for a look around and a cup of tea before it was time for the entertainment to begin. The Abbey  urlLink    was really beautiful and we were confronted by something like 10,000 people all with chairs, tables, candles, champagne etc. Chris Holland and Jools were both fantastic as were the rest of  urlLink   the band.  urlLink   Me and me misses had a great time and couldn't resist a boogie up at the front, in what space we could find at least. The fireworks were amazing and seemed to cover the whole sky at the end, nice and short too so no time to get bored. Then it was off home the next day for lots of sleep, great.

      Well, we made it we're here in good ole Oz. Flights went really well, no delays and I actually quite enjoy flying. Took about 12 hours to get to Singapore by which time we were quite tired and by the time we got on the flight to Melbourne we passed out pretty much  instantly. We arrived in  urlLink   Melbourne around half seven local time so we crashed out soon after getting to my uncles to avoid too much jet lag. Only just getting full nights sleep now though as it's taken a while to settle down. Temperature was 14c and raining on arrival but getting slowly better, should be mid twenties after the weekend. We have a BBQ to meet the family on Sunday so I'll let you know how all that goes. Food here has been great, really big portions and good quality for a reasonable price. The trafic lights make a weird clicking noise and you're always told not to dash;) The birds here are really cool as well, they get these little parrot sort of things that are really pretty and the Indian Minor which is apparantloy evil. We also went to a Cafe in town where these really cute sparrows just fly around you looking for scraps. Which reminds me, there's no where you can smoke round here, we went to a Cafe and asked a guy if we could smoke and get a cup of coffee to which the reply was "What, at the same time?", weird. Found an English pub the other dat called the Elephant and Wheelbarrow that had Old Speckled Hen, although it was very cold and cost a fortune it was great. Already been to the Aquarium in town to see the pretty  urlLink   fishies which was great as we saw pretty much all the  urlLink   stars from Finding Nemo which we saw on the plane over here. Got to see some Gummy (baby) Sharks and then had them for lunch the next day, very tasty indeed. Still looking for jobs and somewhere to live so we'll see how that goes, fingers crossed everyone. Think that's about it so this is Phil, in an internet cafe in Cranbourne filled with pre-pubesent boys signing off:)

      Bye, bye Cassie and Sean, sniff sniff:'( Me and me misses went to go and say goodbye to Cassie and Sean at the Weekend, they have a really nice flat in Lewisham with wooden floors and space and everything. Found a nice little pub near their flat which had Spitfire which is one of the greatest beers available on mass. Still seems weird saying goodbye to people like when we saw Martin for the last time the other week. Can't help but think I'll be sat in a pub next week still having a game of chess with him. It does sort of bring it home a bit that we're actually going as well. The stress is starting to really build up with all of those last minute details still getting sorted out. I think me and me misses are both getting a bit fed up with telling people about the flights and where we're flying to as well now. There's some people I've even had to tell twice, if you really are interested then why not remember it when I told you the first time. I also feel like, even though I have not yet been to Oz, I am fully qualified to write a seven volume encyclopaedia of advice to other travellers by compiling all the stuff we keep getting told. It really gets stupid when people tell you to look out for Dara in Adelaide or some guy with an earring in Sydney. Anyways we managed to avoid all this by going to watch Blackball last night for a bit of a farewell to good old British Comedy. Damn good film, go and see it.

      Went down the Rose And Thistle last night with  urlLink   Martin for a game of chess with me misses. Martins got this  urlLink   three player chess set, I won't bother explaining the rules now because they do get a bit crazy but it's a fairly good game if you're in the mood. There is only one winner and that's the guy that checkmates one of the other two opponents, which happened to be  urlLink   me:) Although I see revenge on the cards in the form of internet chess as Martins going off around Europe and me and me misses are off to Oz. A fun night was had by all, just want some sleep now. Oh, and an iBook.

      Just got back from a weekend up at my Grandparents in Hertfordshire, they live a lovely little cottage which is part of the now demolished Radnor Hall. Me and me misses got a lift from my parents on Saturday morning and stopped off at my Aunt and Uncles Livery on the way. Can't remember the name for sure but I think it may be Cowley Livery. Lovely place, they've both put a lot of hard work into the place and seem to be doing really well. Had a night up at an Aunts for drinks and food and few party games as you do then it was back to my Grandparents for a challenging night of single bed sleeping with me misses:) Sunday was a bit less exciting, had a lovely walk up to the  urlLink   reservoir for a cup of tea, then it was back for a massive lunch to find some people had the  urlLink   right idea. All in all a good weekend, always nice to escape the evil clutches of Reading.

      Went to Victoria Market today in Melborne which was huge, they've got all kinds of stuff that you wouldn't believe including real Kangeroo skins, live geese and chickens and chicks and gods know what else :)  Managed to get a whole load of stuff for the car including oil and a jerry can. We also got same Animal Repellers, which are basically shaped plastic thingies that you stick to the front of your car and they make a noise, from the wind blowing through them. This noise is very high pitched and scares kangeroos and such like, or so they say anyway.  Decided to have a couple of big bottles of VB tonight to prepare us for the trip on Saturday.

      More about the jobs later as I'm going to try and do this in chronological order. Went to the old Melbourne Gaol for a night performance with candles and some freaky guy telling us all about the Gaol, very cool. We got to see the last gun Ned Kelly used as well as his brothers  urlLink   suit of armour (Neds is at the library). We also went to see the England vs. Samoa rugby match at a pub after walking all over town. We'd phoned a pub on the other side of town to check they were showing the game live which they said they were so off we went. When we got there they said that the game was not being shown live but would be on at around eleven. Sod that, and off we went to another pub coincidentally passing the Telstra Dome where the match was being played:D When we finally found somewhere the match was well over and the place was crowded with supporters shouting the score at us, damn English hooligans;) We've also met a lovely Ozzy couple called Ian and Rose who gave us free tickets to a Magic show at the town hall which was really good. They had the American flashy magician with fluorescent lights and a sparkly shirt, then a good old dinner jacket affair that was about five-foot tall and very funny. Later there was a guy who could play the accordion while bouncing on a unicycle as well, lovely. Then we all went for a few beers at some place called the Imperial that was quite nice and close to home. So anyways, about these jobs. Marion has managed to find us some jobs doing pruning in a place called Nyah which is near Swanhill and about four and a half hours drive north of Melbourne. All sounds very good as we've got our own trailer to stay in at only $120 a week which is pretty cheap, yes I know we'll now officially be trailer trash just like on Jerry Springer:) I'll let you know how it pans out, take care all.

      Okay so you didn't eraly need to know about that but just so you do, me and the misses both have colds:( Just about got over them now but I still think it really sucks, things like colds shouldn't happen over here. Anyways, I just wanted to mention some of our new favourite TV things over here. Most Ozzy TV appears to be a bit crappy but thy do have their moments. For example there is the fantastic  urlLink   Rove McManus who hosts a talk show and is damn funny, also they have  CNNNN  which is a truely great news parody type thing and a show called Life Support which is pretty good. As for the rest of it, avoid at all costs.

      Hands up who got the Simon and Garfunkel reference. Me and me misses went to Melbourne Zoo the other day, really enjoyed it. Got to see loads of  urlLink   monkees including the most  urlLink   depressed Gorilla in the history of the world. We also got some pictures of the  urlLink   elephants with Daud, that probobly needs an explanation. Daud was the name of a guy Marion worked for in Reading, he had a stall in Broad Street Mall. The whole time she was working there, there was this little purple elephant on top of the stall, so when she finished she took him home and called him Daud. He is now our official travelling elephant and will be with us on all our travels. The  urlLink   Koalas were pretty dull to be honest but they have these little  urlLink   hedgehog things that are much cooler and really cute, I forget the name. Loads of  urlLink   Kangeroos, even one with a baby which was really, really sweet. On the whole a really good day. Grace (the car) has been out and about quite a bit, getting used to Ozzy roads just about although I still don't like trams. Drove all the way from Fitzroy to Cranbourne in the pouring rain yesterday but it was good experience and at least it dried up for the journey back. Went to the Museum in Melbourne today which was pretty good. Got to see loads of native aborigonie stuff and loads of  urlLink   dead animals as well. They also had a skeleton from a pigmy whale which was huge. Take care.  PS Saw an advert for Nads hair removle cream (the brand name is actually Nads, crazy:s

      Me and me misses now have a new addition to our family, her name is Grace and she's a Ford Cortina GHIA. She's also the same age as me and me misses as she was also created in 1981:) We picked her up last night along with all the origonal manuals, a steering wheel lock and a Ned Kelly keyring. Drove on the freeway for most of the way then used the back roads for the last little bit. Did some night driving, after finding the lights:s and some terrible parking as I'm more used to power steering. I get some piccies as soon as possible. Off to the Zoo now. Take care.  PS That's what I call a  urlLink   sunset.

      Finally moved into our first place, it's costing us around $200 a week which is quite good for what we get. We're right near town just opposite the museum which we can see from our window,  urlLink   beautiful view. We have our very own beer fridge and a TV. Other than that the job hunt goes on, anyone got some contract work, anybody? ;) Picking up the car on Monday, can't wait to drive around and see some of the sights. Think we might be off to a night tour of Melbourne's Gaol (Jail), I have no idea why it's spelt like that. It's where Ned Kelly was hanged, they have his armour and a death mask which will be nice:s Anyways, hope everyone is doing well, take care.

      Me and me misses went for our first walk in the bush on Tuesday. Okay, so it was a btanical garden that wasn't all that big but it got pretty exciting. We set off after a quick look at the local map convinced we'd found a really nice walk there from my uncles through the countryside. What we failed to realize was that in Oz they don't seem to have a great love for pavements on there roads when you get out of town:( It took quite a while to get there along dusty highways with massive trucks roaring past at crazy speeds. When we finally found the gardens we realized we'd gone to the service entrance which was not for the public. So we did what we do best and went in anyway looking foreign and confused:s By the time we'd found the park we were dying of thirst and were more than a little releaved to discover that they had a picnic area which must have some small kiosk selling drinks. Alas no, just a few benches, the treck continued:( We finally found the way to the main entrance and made it back to the highway to get home when a lovely German guy who moved here in the 70's gave us a lift back to town and dropped us just outside the pub where we then quenched our thirst with ice cold beer (which fr once we were glad of).  In other news, we have found our transport for our year here in Oz. A lovely 1981 Ford Cortina. The window seals are a bit on the dodgy side but other than that it's great little car. I'll get some piccies up here as soon as possible.  We've also got the go ahead for our accomodation which we move into on Friday around miday. I'll let you know how it goes.  Take care people.

      We went to our first Ozzy barbaque last night with my uncle. We went to se some of his family at their place which was really nice. They have a huge house with a massive garden on the back and one of those gas barbeques that made life a whole lot easier. We took our own booze and had to put up with constant pomey jokes about warm beer but it was worth it for the food:) Had a great night meeting everyone and learning more about Oz in general. Marions has managed to track down somewhere for us to live on Friday so finger crossed and away we go. Looks like I may be signing up to a work agency when we get into town as work is proving hard to find but I'm sure it'll all work out. Must dash as time is limited, take care.

      Peaches are from this day forth not to be purchased from anywhere ever! They are evil incarnate and we're sure the devil must have a large orchard of them in hell.We've been thinning them and the dust that comes off them is horrible, really ichy which makes you go insane with wanting to scratch (which only makes it worse). On the upside we did get to see baby Preying Mantis' which look threatening in a very cute sort of way.

      Decided to finally go and be tourists for the day and see rustic Echuca. The drive took a bit longer than expected but we got there just in time to have an hours cruise on a  urlLink   paddle steamer named The Canberra. The temperature was getting up a bit and it was lovely to be down on the river with a bit of a breeze. We saw some fantastic sights including trees that look like they're walking down to the river where the bank has eroded away leaving the roots and massive house boats with patios on the back. After the cruise we had some lunch in a cafe/bar called The Star which was lovely. We sat outside in the shade of a fig tree, I had Barra Mundi (fish) in beer batter and Marion had a quiche. All very nice and a bit of a change from Safeways home brand Then it was a quick trip to the "aquarium" which was a glorified fish shop but very sweet and a wander round the wax work museum before home.

      Managed to find another really cool looking spider today, evil looking bugger but I think it was more scared of me I was pulling milk cartons off the smaller trees, which are put there to stop the sprays killing them and rabbits chewing the young bark off. I'd just started feeling safe when I pulled one off to find this evil thing looking back at me, won't be doing that again in a hurry.  34c today which is normally okay but because we're working at Peters place the trees aren't big enough to provide any shade so you do get really hot and bothered.  We also managed to find somewhere, after much wandering, that sells liquorice Rizlas in town. Turns out the video rental place is also a tobacconist which had some really old looking packs from the dawn of time or something. The guy sold us them for $10 for 16 packs so I'll be okay for a while, we were also informed that we have cool accents.  Had a bottle of Mighty Murry with dinner, very nice Shiraz.

      Don't panic we haven't gone anywhere just yet but we are no halfway through our time working here so Sydney is getting closer :) ' Managed to lose the car keys this morning before work but finally found them down the back of the sofa, as if it wasn't obvious. In the insuing panic we managed to lock ourselves out though so we had to break in when we got back after work. Marion has obviously had some expertise ir, breaking and entering as it only took her a minute or two and then it was straight for the good silver ;) Banks really do suck here, we've been trying to pay our paychecks in for the last week and due to the bank being closed at four we need to use the ATM. This is all great but they never have any of the damn deposit envelopes to use so we may have to open a can of whoop ass on them :)

      Don't worry people I'm fine, no long term damage done but I did manage to fall off the trailer at work today:{ I was walking along near the edge but thought I had a lot more space left then just stepped out into space. Luckily (so Marian says) I landed on my shoulders an my back kinda. Managed to knock the wind out of me and it certainly hurt for a while but getting better now. Marion got to see some spider in the trees today but we haven't been able to identify it because she let go of the branch it was an and most likely catapulted it all the way to Sydney:)

      Still raining when we woke up this morning which presented an interesting problem with the loo. We don't have one in the van and it's a bit of a dash to get to the toile, block. So when we decided we could wait no longer we got ready far the dash, then the rain stopped, woo hoo, all is good. Got to watch the rugby in the cammunial TV room with some Fijians who were celebrating someone's girls birthday. Everyone was very nice and Marion got to try some Cava which is a drink made from the Cava plant and acts like a relaxant. The rugby was great and Jonny Wiikinson was truly amazing, a real star of the whole competition, The Cizzies have this chant that goes "Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy, Oi, Oi, Oi". So we made up "Jonny, Jonny, Jonny, Oi, Oi, Oi".

      Got rained on at work today while we were up on the trailer so we had to shelter in the cars until it stopped as it can get a bit slippery up there when it's wet. Only lasted half an hour so we were soon back out and thinning like some kind of thinning machine. By the time we got back to the van I was shattered and passed out for a couple of hours when Marlon woke me to see 4 1 wanted anything to eat. I thought sleep would be better so I got another hours kip only to be awoken by the sound of torrent's of rain falling with thunder and lightning. As you can imagine it was pretty loud in the van and we were pretty chuffed there weren't any leaks.

       urlLink   We got to see our first storm in Oz. We spent the whole day at work and could see it on the horizon but the most we got was a few little spots of rain. We get the day off if it really rains hard or there's a storm but no such luck:( Instead it waited until we got back from Swan Hill which was kind of handy. It started with a really strong wind which whipped up the dust into a tiny dust storm which was really impressive to watch. Then came the lightning, thunder and rain. It didn't actually amount to much though and all we got was a little more rain in the night with a bit of lightning. Best nights sleep I've had for ages though, weird:s

I remember my parents used to use it with varying success but we shall see. Still been really muggy today not sure what the temperature is and we've had a bit more rain. More storms forecast for tomorrow, everyone cross your fingers for a long weekend :)

      Our van has been invaded by ants, the little buggers have found a way in past the fly screens under the sink. We're currently keeping them at bay by spraying them with Bushmans insect repellent but soon I will buy some special ant killing stuff *evil laugh*. - Marion made us a lovely sausage casserole for dinner which we had with a bottle of wine. Nice relaxing day.

       urlLink   Woke up this morning to find a HUGE huntsman spider in the van, they're not poisonous but can give you a really nasty bite. Being the big, strong man that I am I got him out of the van and saved the day Q Got up to 42c today so we we went to cool off at the local pool but unfortunately there was some sort of swimming competition or something and we weren't allowed:( So we choose to drown our sorrows in a tittle pub instead that was only a short drive away. I contented myself with coke and chilled coffee whilst Marion sunk the beers. Ended up talking to a few of the locals who were really friendly if a little difficult to understand. I only remember two of there names which were Bushy and Scrapper.

      Went to work at someone else's place today, guy called Bob, seems a pretty sound bloke, doesn't mind the heat and not crazy. Off to a good start then. . No, his trees must have been involved in some nuclear experiment or something, they're massive. You have to go round on this  urlLink   trailer pulled by a tractor which has things to stand so you can reach the damn fruit. You also have to pull the branches over to reach the tops which makes an excellent opportunity for taking the mick out of Phil's weedy arms:( Got paid from Peter as well, $500, hip, hip, do you know the way to Sydney? Well I don't but Marion does and has written it down :)

We went into town after work and got Marion a hat with fly netting that she is overly happy with, I got a big straw hat which works a treat. Got to see one of Sues Red Backs today and we're definitely not getting one, they are evil incarnate.

      Work sucks, it takes ages and you can't drink beer and smoke while you do it. It was 21 degrees Celsius and we were in a field thinning nectarines. What the HELL is all that about huh, huh? I though a nectarine was one of those miniature oranges you get at christmas but apparently this is not the case, when I realised they weren't supposed to be turning orange and round shaped it made a bit more sense: sThe guy we're working for is  urlLink   Peter who seems okay if a little crazy. He smokes a lot and doesn't like the heat, he lives in Australia, in one of the hot bits, you can see why he's crazy. I forgot the flies, the flies are also crazy, there's loads and they try to drown themselves in your eyes. Marion didn't like this to say the least:'(

      500 Km to Nyah from Melbourne and we made it safe and sound after 6 hours of driving, ouch:(We stopped at Echuca on the way which was a really good time to stop. Got some lunch in a bakery and had a walk down by the river then it was off again on the road to Nyah.The drive itself was kind of strange as the countryside went from almost an English countryside to a barren looking wasteland, all boulders and dry grasses. Still very striking in its own way and really quite beautiful at times. Marion saw an Echidna which I mentioned before, its a kind of hedgehog and probably our favourite Ozzy animal ;)I was the first one to see a kangeroo in the wild in it's natural surroundings, road kill:)Got to the caravan park at around seven and finally got settled down in  urlLink   our caravan, it's small but cosy and we like it. So we are now officially trailer trash just like on Jerry Springer, so no doubt one of us will soon lose our two front teeth and have an affair with a goat (there actually is one on the site).  urlLink   We also have two peakocks, some guinne pigs and chickens for our neighbours.Marions not a big fan of the insects, the ants are huge and there's a lot of flies but we're learning to cope by killing them in large quantities with bug spray *evil laugh*.The lady that runs the park, Sue, is an interesting character, she keeps Red Backs as pets in jars when she finds them round the park. Red Backs are little spiders that kill people, yes, KILL PEOPLE. Marion would like one for a pet, I told her to sit in the shade more :)We've been keeping ourselves sane by playing cards and reading, Marion has yet to beat me in a game of 501 rummy, or come that close to be fair but she's trying and makes good toast:)

      Basicly I spent most of the day sleeping, this is a new pastime that I find goes well with reading and drinking. When we did get into Sydney, looking particularly smart as well (I had shoes on, shoes for the love of [insert relevant diety]), we were just in time for the 9pm fireworks which weren't too shabby but were a bit difficult to see as the railway bridge was in the way. After all that excitment we went for a drink in a bar called The Ship Inn where we met a couple called Philip and Kathryn who were Irish and Australian respectivly. Had a good chat about something I forget and drank a few beers before the 12pm fireworks which were significantly more explosive and rather nice. This is where the evening took a bit of a downer as we went back to the bar and were told we couldn't go in to use the loos even though we had bought drinks. So it was off to the public station toilets which turned out to be overflowing with all sorts of unmentionables:s Then as we walked around the streets we noticed some guy about to have his head kicked in saved only by some members of the public (No coppers in sight), crazy town. Then everything was made better by some lady who played the bagpipes under a bridge, she was grewat so we gave her $20 and went home vowing to not go back to Sydney:p

      Damn you Sydney, damn yooooouuuuuuuuuuuu!!! Yep, that's right, oops we've done it again and got lost in Sydney. It all started of so well with us planning to go to a camping shop down the road from where we live, roads here are never that simple though. We knew something was amiss when we asked a guy manning a toll both how to get to Anzac PDE to which his reply was "I tell you one thing, Harbour Bridge is that way" pointing in the direction to which we were now committed:( After an hour or so we did manage to escape the city once more and did finally buy a gas lamp and a new air bed, hooray. We also had Chilli for breakfast as it was the only restraunt we could find:s Grace has also made a trip to the mechanics for a tune up for her Christmas present and we should be piucking her up in a few days.

      Had a bit of a tourist sort of day in Sydney, we were supposed to be buying things for the tent but gave up after about ten minutes. Instead we found a  urlLink   giant chess set in a park near town which was great to sit down with a drink and a fag and watch for a while with the  urlLink   ibex. After a bit of aimless meandering we went in the direction on the  urlLink   Opera House and after rubbing a pigs nose for luck we ran into the botanical gardens which were really pretty. There were also a huge amount of fruit bats hanging in the trees and occaisionaly flying around, very cool. Finally found the Opera House without too much difficulty, does look pretty cool from the outside but for some reason the inside in all bare concrete and really nasty think carpet. Got a good look at the harbour bridge as well, even saw the people climbing over the top, nutters. To round of the day we had a lovely meal, steak for me and fish for me misses, and coronas a plenty:p

      The sweeties Marion bought me for Christmas have all melted into one big jar of gloop which you have to spoon out with your hands, mmmmmm, glooooop:) Let that be a lesson to those who think that celebrating Christmas in the middle of summer is an easy task. We've also found a great little cafe in Rockdale that does egg and bacon rolls for $3.50, it's healthy eating all the way.

      Went down the pub in Rockdale called the Grand Hotel tonight and met a couple of guys who taught us how to play American pool. Mark (Kiwi) and Lee (Croatian) were two of the nicest blokes we've met since we got here. Ended up going back to their flat for a few more drinks and a chat. On the way home which was a bit of a walk we got a pizza from a really cool looking cafe called Jailhouse Rock which was stuffed with Elvis memorabilia:)

      Marion got me loads of cool stuff including a Hackey Sack and a copy of Birdsong and a lizard game, hooray. After a very relaxed morning we had a walk to the train and went to  urlLink   Bondi for the afternoon. Really impressed with their trains, they almost have three levels and they're so smooth you'd think you were floating. Temperature was in the thirties which was so strange but when we got to the beach it was great. Powdery white sand, a brilliant blue sky and sea all filled with people. We both went for a swim and splashed around in the waves for quite a while before getting some food at a place called Chish and Fips and having a snooze on the grass. We go the train back home and had an early night, a Christmas I will certainly not forget.

      Sunny and humid today, still nothing like Christmas. Had a bacon and egg roll in town then lazed around for a while. Later in the afternoon we decided to go shopping in town and took the car for a drive, forgetting it was Christmas Eve:) The roads were crazy and when we finally made it into the multi-story car park I had to resort to singing Christmas carols to stay sane:) I also tried to use the horn on the car but won't be doing it again as it sounds a bit lady like;)

      Having learnt our lesson we finally found a camping site in a place called Rockdale which is only a ten minute walk from the train station and then a 10-15 minute ride into town. Home at last. We ended up camping next to two Scottish guys who are travelling with an American guy and had a good chat with them.

      Drove from Canberra to Sydney today that took about four hours, not bad I hear you say, but wait there's more. We then spent a further four hours trapped in Sydney city centre, we drove over the harbour bridge twice and upset who knows how many commuters but got to Bondi in the end, hooray:) Nope, not hooray, when we get to Bondi we find out that it's a really fancy area and that there aren't any camping sites for miles around. So we end up staying in this dive called the Aegean, which cost $80 for the night, it did have a pool but I couldn't see to the bottom and the owner was currently being taken to court:/ To keep ourselves sane we decided to get beered up in Coogee (where we were now) and get a pizza.

      Went into Canberra town today to do some Christmas shopping and see the sights. Me and mess misses allowed each other $70 and two hours to shop for each others presents which seemed to work really well, suppose we'll see by Thursday. We also had a look round the old and new parliament buildings and got to see the  urlLink   Aboriginal tent parliament that looks so impressive in the park with the old parliament building in the background. Got to see another car stolen as well while we sat in a park having a drink, seems they always leave ours alone:s

      Tried to move the car this morning and she decided she'd had enough, started motor was okay but the engine wouldn't turn over at all. We had to call out the maintenance guy to help us move the car as we were moving to a cheaper van. As we were staring at the lifeless engine guess who walked by, a fully qualified mechanic:) Turns out the points were fused, which we now know all about and how to fix. To say thanks we decided to go out and buy  urlLink   him and his seven months pregnant wife a couple of beers and a box of chocolates.

      Another seven hour drive, this time to Canberra, got to see two dead wombats on the road down there. They're massive animals, like furry tanks or something. We decided to stay in a cabin when we finally found somewhere as it was already raining and we couldn't be bothered putting up a tent in the rain. Managed to find a bar that served Guinness called All Bar Nun and met some guy who apparently advises the prime minister who was a real tit;)

Found a great cafe where we had breakfast, I had pancakes with lemon, sugar, ice cream and a strawberry and Marion had a crepe stuffed with bacon, cheese and mushrooms. Had our first experience of proper heavy rain in the tent this afternoon, she held up well and we saw out the afternoon with tea and biscuits.

Found a site in Lakes Entrance for $20 a night with ensuite, power and a swimming pool, lovely.

      Me and me misses woke up this morning to find that some cheeky  urlLink   huntsman spider had sneaked under the awning of our tent and was sitting on the inner sheet, so I played the big strong man and released him back into the wild no doubt to do the same to the next tent dweller he encounters. After a quick drive into Melbourne we booked into the Nunnery, which is a backpackers right near town, for $80 for the night. We then had a mad dash across town to catch a tour bus to go and see  urlLink   Ramsay Street. The thing is, it's not actually called Ramsay Street, and it's called Pine Oak, pah! They were doing their last day of filming when we got there so we couldn't get that close but we got to see Erinsborough High and drove past the studios. After all that we decided that beer was the answer to all of life's problems and worked our way home through the Elephant and Castle and then The Pump House:)

      Drove the Great Ocean Road today from Warrnambool to Geelong, it starts out fairly flat and you pass through some dry rainforest which is quite impressive. We stopped for some breakfast in a nice little cafe with a gorgeous view that was slightly ruined by a swarm of flies and the waitress bring each item of our breakfast out separately in little bowls:/ After that we got back on the road again and hit the really twisty turny bits, this is when I got really scared. Not being a great fan of heights in the first place I did not like the sheer drops and dimly lit woodland I had to crawl up and down hills in, especially with motorbikes screaming past me:s We did get to Apollo bay though and that was another beautiful beach, I just enjoyed a well-earned fag:) Then it was a nice bit of twisty ocean side driving into Geelong.

      Had to buy a duvet today as last night was a bit chilly, as we're down on the coast now, not used to it getting below 20c. Had a look at the beach at Warrnambool but it was a bit chilly for a swim so instead we had a bite to eat and then went back to the campsite for a swim in their pool. After a bite to eat we had a wander into town for a pint in the local Irish pub, which was really nice and homely feeling, but we only got through half a pint before we were all turfed out for the night.

      Seven hours of driving today from Nyah to Warrnambool. Got to see the Black Mountains and the Grampians, which were really striking when all the land around was flat and fairly barren. Managed to get the tent up fairly easily, really love the size of it, loads of space inside. Decided to treat ourselves to a nice meal at a restraunt down the road for dinner. We had a pizza and a bottle of wine, as we were finishing the wine out in the garden Marion saw a rat run past her then a few moments later I saw a couple at the end of the path. We told the owner who didn't seem too worried about it other than they may scare customers:)

      Went into town today and bought the tent which will soon be our home, we managed to get a 'last season' one really cheap. It's a six-man tent with a ten by ten foot sleeping area and a fairy large sitting area out front. Marion tried a  urlLink   Dragon fruit today, which looked just like frogs spawn and apparently tasted of nothing, did look cool from the outside though.

      Last day of work today, only thinning peaches that was quite relaxing as a lot of the day was taken up by ground work. After we finished Stuart showed us  urlLink   his bus, which he's converted into a caravan sort of thing. It really is amazing to look at; the inside looks so professionally done. He even makes his own bio-diesel from used chip fat. Colin and Sherrie cooked us a meal tonight to wish us well on our travels,  urlLink   Bob our boss came over as well and we had a really  urlLink   nice night of it. We also got to have banana Pavlova that was very good indeed.

      More peaches until 2:15pm today. Marion accidentally put a huntsman through the washing machine today and only found it when she turned a sock inside out, needless to say it didn't make it:( Looks like me and the misses may be investing in our first home together, we've had a look round and found something in our price range and it looks like we're going for it. We've decided to buy outright rather than go for a mortgage as we have the money available to us at present. It's a nice place, portable, canvass like with some poles:) We're gonna live in a tent:)

       urlLink   More picking of peaches today but we finished by 11:45am as we'd got most of the itchy buggers yesterday. Went for a relaxing walk with me misses down by the Murray looking for roos but alas we only found a yob on his dirt bike:/

      Picked peaches today at work, which is an interesting way to spend your weekend. You get a kind of  urlLink   bag that hangs in front of you that you then fill up and off load into a trailer and then carry on. Luckily the temperature got up to 30c by 2:30pm so we got to go home as the heat damages the fruit.

      Went to go and see Matrix Revolutions in town this afternoon, pap is all I can say. Okay so it had some kinda funky bits but on the whole, pap. To brighten our spirits we went to visit  urlLink   Albert the giant Murray cod who was a prop in the movie Eight Ball but now sits next to a barbeque in Swanhill. We also went to see the  urlLink   Burke and Wills tree that is a massive fig planted, I think, by the explorers.

      Only managed three hours work today as my back started playing up again and I had to go home for some rest that really sorted it out. Marion carried on to work till the end of the day being the trooper that she is and now the principal wage earner;) Got a mango in town at the supermarket and had it as a treat before dinner, wow, mango's rock. Had an amusing incident while trying to play cards, Marion managed to spill a glass of red wine over the table so we had to use milk to stop it staining (it really works) but then she knocked the milk over as well, I have such a gifted girlfriend:)

      Me and the misses went into Freo (Fremantle) today which was great, so relaxing and generally lovely. We had a look around for some backpackers places and found one with a spa, that may be a bit much for us so ew think we may have settled on the old firestation which has free internet, parking and a lovely kitchen and common room all for $250  week, great. We also found loads of hippy shops and I ended up buying a hemp bag, very cool. Thank God though, there were less crystal shops than Glastonbury:) We even got to see a Rainbow Lauraquete eating fruit off a tree we were sitting under, very cute looking birds those.

      Lot's of lazy days by the pool, it's all good really. There's a few too many kids about for my liking due to a long weekend for Australia day but other than that the park is great. Had a lovely lunch of fresh bread, brie, garlic and herb dips, homous and stuff. Then for dinner me misses barbaqued some red snapper with lemongrass, pucka. Had a walk down to Jervoise beach today as well, due to being the Indian Ocean it's actually quite warm and so nice to swim in we stayed a little too long and got a little burnt, oops:( We did find loads of  urlLink   pretty shells though as well as a crabs shell with the most amazing pattern on the back. Me misses also found her first red back down a drain tonight ehich she is very proud of even though I won't let her keep it.

      When we got up this morning we were treated to a fly over by some red-tailed black cockatoos which were lovely and apparantly endangered so we decided not to bag one for dinner. On our way to Fremantle we stopped off at a little cofee shop in Northam for a cup of tea and a rest. Turns out that the owner is trying new things to batter so I thought I'd mention battered mars bars (I have fond memories of these from Marshies in Stubbington). So off they went and got some Mars bars, battered them and they were great, apparantly they will be on the menu sometime soon. Mark this day well, Phil introduces battered Mars bars to Australia:) Saw yet more of the  urlLink   Golden pipeline today as well. It appears to be a huge concrete pipe stretching across most of Australia, preumably carrying water. Set the tent up at Woodman Point which is a very touristy caravaan park but has a lovely pool and all the modern fads.

      Before setting off this morning we decided to have a look round Norseman and get some breaky. We managed to find the metal camel statues on the roundabout as well as a  urlLink   brass statue of the horse the town is named after, cute huh? When we made it to Southern Cross we found a lovely little caravaan park which even has a book exchange. We like these as it costs no money and we get some new stuff to read. For dinner we went to the local pub which did us a roast beef and yorkshire pud dinner which was beautiful. They even seem to have proper pavements here which makes a nice change. When we finally got back to the tent me misses found a huge  urlLink   preying mantis outside the loos, he seemed to be enjoying himself so we let him be.

      Me misses had a bit of a shock this morning to find that a  urlLink   giant millapede had spent the night under the tent as well as a rather nifty looking beetle. We decided to let them go as we still have plenty of super noodles and haven't got that hungary just yet, Finally found the blow hole at Madura pass, frankly it was rubbish, no info, nothing, rubbish. After a bit more driving we decided to have a look at the Caiguna blow hole. This one did have some interesting info on them, turns out no water in involved, just 100+kph winds. There were some dead roos in the hole though so it wasn't a completely wasted trip. Time for the navigator to get some rest, it's the  urlLink   90 mile straight. It's the longest straight road in Australia and gets very boring. Finally found a museum that's been built, this time at Balladonia. It's got some bits about th crashing of Skylab (American satelite) back in 1979 and some interesting items on local people and history. End of the road trip, for a night at least, arrived in Norseman. Apparantly the town is named after a horse that was tied up for a night and unearthed a nugget of gold with his hoof and started a gold rush:) We both got certificates for crossing the Nullabor and celebrated with a few bevvies at the local pub. Caught two rather  urlLink   randy trucks on the way back from the pub, can't think what they were up to;)

      Started our journey across the Nullabor (treeless plain) today so there won't be anymore towns for a while just the road houses and camp sites really. Saw some more Emus and Kangeroos today as well as a hell of a lot of road kill. Also saw the flying doctors emercency airstrip, which is basically the road we were driving on. For some reason someone had covered a tree in plastic bottle by the roadside which was quite pretty but very strange. Lot's of giant animal sculptures as well, giant  urlLink   Galas and  urlLink   Kangeroos. Me and me misses then went to the  urlLink   old telegraph station at Eucla which is really fantastic. It's just an old ruined building really but it's half covered by this beutifully white sand so we had a bit of a run around and a  urlLink   play. back on the road again we tried to go to a museum in Mundrabilla only to discover it was not yet built so we pushed on to Mundura to stay the night. Lovely little campsite, very pretty but they did have a very loud generator for some reason.

      Ran out of cash today and had almost a two hour round trip to get to the ATM, not to common in these parts apparantly. I tried to be all clever and make some garlic crutons this evening and managed to charcoal the garlic, not as tasty as I was hoping.

      Saw some Emus by the side of the road today which was kinda cool as well at two kangeroos by a hill called  urlLink   Whites Knob;) It's really cool when you drive around here as you can see the next town almost 10km away by the huge  urlLink   silos they all have. We found a nice enough place to put the tent but for some reason the camp site is covered in  urlLink   powdery white stuff that feels like concrete if you try to  urlLink   get a peg in:s Makes it look like a lunur landscape.

      We got woken up at some God forsaken hour of the morning by an entire flirtilla of Cockatoos. Evil, loud birds bring pain. After recovering from that which took a considerable amount of time we went into town and found an English guy doing proper English breakfasts with pots of tea (enough for four cups!) each. The whole lot only cost us $20 which is less than five quid each.

      Woke up last night to hear some strange noises of something going through our rubbish, so being the big strong man that I am I got Me Misses to go and have a look. Tuned out to be a cat after our corned beef the cheeky bugger. Drove to Gawler which is just outside Adelaide an found  fairly good site for about $15 a night. For dinner we found another great Irish pub called Fibber Molleys that did food. I had a Cajun steak  and Marion went for a steak with mushroom, garlic and whiskey sauce, very nice.

      Drove to Mildura and got there fairly early, we even found a great little camp site that only charges $17 a night and has a pool:) On the way down we got to see a dust storm on the horizon as well as two twisters. One of them was even right next to the road as we drove past and you could see the debris it had picked up sort of hovering in the air. After the tent was up we had a 2Km treck to the pub but when we got there it wa well worth it. A great little Irish place with fantastic Guinness and live music, although the live music was a bit depressing. We even bought a pizza on the way home in the style of the drunk young couple we were:)

      Had a nice lazy day in town today, managed to get some good looking books from a charity shop including Logans Run and The Forth Protocal. For dinner it was noodles and dim-sum with a bottle of wine and the Express crossword for company. Whoever writes that damn crossword really likes Charles Dickens:p

      Had a bit of a windy night last night, looks like the tents only just holding up, might have to get some new poles before long. Eight hour drive to West Wyalong today, we wanted to get a bit further but it took almost four hours to clear Sydney and it's rubbish roads. Had a stop off at  urlLink   Wentworth Falls which were truelly spectacular, I was a bit scarred and wouldn't go near the edge but Me Misses got some  urlLink   great pictures. The fog was amazing up there as well, made everything look very mystical and mostly white. Due to our air pump dying we also had to inflate the damned air bed ourselves which spurred on by th thought of the pub took only ten minutes:) The pub was lovely and reminded us of home, met a few locals and put back a few bevvies before bed.

      Did a bit of Sun worshipping today at Marouba bay or at least after we found somewhere to park. Turns out everyone had the same idea of the beach for Sunday afternoon and all the car parks were full to bursting. We even saw one guy get out of his people mover and start shouting obcenities at some girl who must of pinched his spot, crazy:s Went down the pub for the night to wind down with a game of chess and pool, oh how I miss English pool tables.

      Picked up Grace from the garage today and she goes like a dream, no misfires and she starts first time, looks like she enjoyed her christmas prezzie. Went to hyde park, after dropping Grace off at the camp site, and ha a lounge and a read. Unfortunatly nobody playing chess today. After a bit of searching we found  urlLink   Scruffy Murpheys (Marion used to work in the one in Reading) and had a fantastic $5 steak. Great value if only the drinks hadn't cost twice the cost of the meal;) Then we had a short wander to the cinema to watch Return Of The King which was fairly good but not great.

      Well I think we're both feeling a bit more positive about jobs now. We've ben planning our final trip round Oz so we at least know what we're saving up for, we may even make a huge thermometer savings gauge for our wall:) With this in mind we've been applying for jobs left right and center, cinemas, Hungry Jacks, you name it. Let's hope something turns up soon. On the way home we popped into the travel agents to find out some more about tours in Tasmania and met a really nice bloke who has a room available to rent. So we went to have a look and it's really nice, big garden, spacious bedroom and a working oven:) At only $120 week we think we'll probobly take it so things are looking up.

      I got a call last night from a guy who works for Hay Recruitment who said that he had a job he could put me forward for so I agreed to have a meeting with him today. Turns out it's a four month contract and I can only work for the same employer for three months, bugger:(. This srtuck me as a bit stupid, you would have thought the agaent could have worked this out before I went al the way into Perth. Anyways, still on the hunt for jobs.

      Bit of a busy one today. Maion lost her wallet somewhere so we had to go and get new bank and MediCare cards then we had a wander to the accident and emergency at the hospital. It wasn't anything serious, just me misses' sore throat but it's the only way to get to see a doctor for free over here:s. The doctor wasn't a whole lot of help so we ended up at a health food shop where we bought some bee propolis and ehinacia. The guy that served us turned out to be from the UK as well so we said we'd go out for a drink with him some time.

We spent most of the day lounging around but did go for a few drinks at the  urlLink   Market Bar which is a really nice pub in the markets. After that we had some pancakes and watched some firedancing before going to see One Perfect Day.

The guys at the camp site were really good and gave us a refund for the days we'd paid for and a free membership card which gets you 10% off other parks:) The room is a bit small but on the whole okay.

      Both me and me misses had interviews today, the first was in West Leederville at 11:30am. Unfortunatly we had to walk quite a way in 35c as the public transport was rubbish. They offered us both jobs on the spot with a $300 retainer, not bad for selling teddy bears. On the way to the next interview we did get to see a really cool  urlLink   preying mantis on a park bench. We ended up cancelling the second interview in favour of teddy bear sales:)

      We've started a habit of going for a swim at nine most mornings as it's a great way to wake up and free, which we can afford:) Me misses has decided though that it's her duty to save all the little bugs that fall into the pool, this morning this involved a suicidel bee that kept throwing himself back in, crazy:s While relaxing later in the tent we got attacked my more of the local wildlife when a bird flew into the tent then straight out again. Nive of him to drop by though. When the heat got too much we decided there was nothing for it but to cool of by going to the local shopping centre which has a few shops and everything is air conditioned, nice:)

      Had a drive down the coat today to Mandurah to see some sights and have a relax by the cost. Turned out to be a lovely little town, very nice. Most of the shops were closed as it was a sunday but we did manage to find an  urlLink   English Sweets shop which amongst the many English sweeties we managed to find a jar of Branston Pickle (crosse and blackwell as well) the holy grail of pickle:D After stocking up on sweeties we toddled off to the shoreline and ate our hearts content while listening to some band that had a stage set up in the park. Marion wanted to ask about diving with dolphins so we went to a diving centre and instead ended up buying some really fancy goggles each. After driving back to the tent we took the car down to Jervoise beach and had a play with the goggles, really great fun, you can see everything. Me misses even saw a little fishy:)

      Marion was feelong a bit rough today so me and Alena decided to take a drive to the video shop to change some videos over, this is where it all went horribly downhill. The first thing was the windscreen. We'd been parked in Walters driveway which had a gum nut tree that covered the car in pollen. As we were driving off I thought I'd wash the windows witht he wipers to get rid of some of it. This then covered the whole windscrren in an opaque sticky goo which made driving a bit more of a challenge:) When we finally reached where we thought the video shop was it turned out we were int he wrong place so we carried on doen the road for ages and eventually found Video Ezy. Turns out though that this was the wrong Video Ezy as Walter had rented the videos from the shop in town. Not to be defeated we carried on back the way we came towards town. Just as we're about to hit the bottom of a hill at a major crossroads on the highway, kablam.  urlLink   The gear stick comes completely away in my hand:s Luckly there was a car park on the left just before the juction so I managed to pull accross the traffic and parked up (after lots of pushing in 30c+). Ended up having to get the car  urlLink   towed back the house as all the mechanics were closed. All in all Video Ezy is a lie, it's damned hard, in fact, almost impossible:)

      Marion bought some Idian sweets today on her way back from an interview. I hadn't had any sice I was at juniour school and they were really great. George caught a mouse  urlLink   this evening after a hell of a lot of running around and pulling out the sofas. He wasn't too sure at first but with a bit of encouragment he was transformed into a somewhat lathargic killing machine.

We started off with a spot of breakfast and a cup of tea then it was off to  urlLink   Cogee Beach for a swim with our groovy goggles. We even got to swim with these really cute little sand coloured fishies that even nibbled me misses' toes:) More relaxing when we got home watching The Battle Of Britain and then off to the Freo markets to pick up loads of cheap fruit and veg. After shopping we thought we'd go for a quiet pint only to find that the whole Irish population (and  urlLink   everyone else) was out to celebrate St. Patricks day. We ended up in Clancys Fish Bar with a really nice group of people who were all very friendly. Due to getting home a little tipsy we plumped for pizza, hooray.

      Marion decided we should have  urlLink   pancakes for breakfast this morning so after making up gallons of batter we got to it. It took us a while to get the hang of it but by the end we were flipping pancakes this way and that. The rest of the day was very relaxed, just sat in front of the telly watching Catch Me If You Can and Dog Soldiers.

      Happy anniversary to us, me and me misses have been going out now for two whole years. Feels like it was only yesterday that I was swished of my feet:) I got a lovely rose and a card delivered to me at work which was very sweet. Me misses also started her new telesales job today selling mobile phones. By the time she got back on the train we were so shattered we had some takeaway and a pint then off to bed.

      Alena, our new house person moved in yesterday. She's German, from Hamburg and very nice. Finally got out for a drive today even though it was raing cats and dogs. We went down to the beach and sat in the car eating cheese and pickle sandwichs watching the rain. Due to now having a fully working and quite swish gas oven we had our first sausage casarole in ages, mmmmmm.

      Left the Old Firestation today bright and early to move into Walters place. While we were leaving the hostel we saw two backpackers trying to get there camper van out hit someones car. They didn't look best pleased as I guess they don't have insurance and will have to pay for the repairs out of their own pockets:( We left the car at Walters place and had a walk into town to go and get the key from Walter at the travel lounge. Turns out that Walter needed a system admin guy to start so it turned out to be me. Basically I'm just keeping things ticking over as well as designing his new website, all good fun:) While I was busy with my new job me misses went home to play with  urlLink   George (the dog) who's lovely. Unfortunatly he got a little randy and me misses ended up trapped at the bottom of the garden, he's a big dog. After a hard day at the office there was nothing for it but a quiet pint and some food at Rosie O' Gradies with me misses.

      Sorry about the lack of updates, I've just been really busy at work and then too busy playing at the weekends:) Not too much has gone on though to be honest. We sent Grace off to the mechanics a while back and just got her back. The gearsticks been wired in again and seems to be holding although I've been told I have to be gentle. Me misses is still the worlds undisputed baking champion after she made choclate chip cookies for everyone at ten O'clock at night after beer, fantastic. We've just started officially planning our final trip round Oz which looks like it may include Darwin as well now so fingers crossed. Money is just starting to build up now, just need to wait and see on that score. Me and me misses took George down the park last week and sort of taught him to play fetch. He kind of gets it but still thinks smells are much more exciting than a tennis ball:) Some huge American and Australian navy ships came into Freo harbour the other day as well which meant the town was overrun with Americans:s They've all gone now but the ships did look cool, we almost got a tour on an Air Craft Carrier but the guy never showed up:( If you're lucky I may even post some pictures soon.

      While me and the misses were in town today we saw a bunch of activists protesting about uranium depletion and John Howard. I've come to the conclusion that there is a fine line between activists and crazy folk, that line is numbers. There must have only been ten or so and dressed up in their chemical suits with a distict lack of literature or explanation for their "lie in" everyone was left a little confused:s

      Marion was giving Walter a hand today cleaning up his house before some people came to view it as it's on the market at the moment. She ended up finding a Redback hidden away somewhere and now has it in a jar for safe keeping. In the evening we went to Clancy's Fish Pub which is a great little pub in town that has some great beers. Turned out there was a pub quiz on so we joined in just for fun and as usual came last:( Althoug me misses did manage to win a chocolate sunday in a game of paper, scissor, stone:D

      What a great birthday, I got a cup of tea in bed and a lie in:) I got loads of great pressies from everyone, my parents got me a great duster that says "I love my Cortina" and a Guinness t-shirt. Marion got me the coolest chess set that comes in a really pretty box. Me misses had arranged for me to get the day off work so we spent most of the day lounging around before going for a walk into town. After a quick lunch at McDonalds (everyone should go to see the red haired, freaky clown on their birthday), we had a couple of drinks at Little Creatures. At this point a got a phone call from the police to say that they'd found the guys who stole our bags and had recovered all of our stuff which was great news, they even sent it to Freo for me to pick up. Then we got a train into Perth where yet more suprises awaited us. First we went for a slap up meal at a very relaxing restaurant that even had a huge fishtank right next to our table. Then it was off to the theatre to see a fringe play about a guy who's son is murdered, who then confronts the publicist that is making the murderer rich and famous. All very tangled and quite exciting. After a short train journey home we walked back to the house, what a lovely day:)

      It was a dark early awakening at around 5:00am so we could make it down to the train in time for a 6:00am to Perth. We made it in plenty of time but man was it cold. When we got into Perth it took a bit of wandering to find our pick up point and not too much later we were greated by a huge, green tour bus which looked about ready to fall apart:) but we were soon on our way. Our first stop was The Dawesville Cut which is a man made canal sort of thing into a huge habour, the coffee at the cafe was good, the harbour I could leave. Unfortunatly the  urlLink   Busselton Jetty was damaged in a recent storm so we couldn't go down to the underwater aquarium at the end but we did get to admire the huge jetty. Instead we went to  urlLink   Ngili caves which were truely astounding and rather lucky as we wanted to go see them anyways. It was so humid in the caves we were both passing out after only a few steps, very beautiful formations though. We also had a quick stop at a Margaret River winery to pick up a bottle of wine before we arrived at our accomodation for the night. We ended up staying in a really cool little hut with a log fire and bunk beds, we even got to have a barbaque which I myself cooked:)  Day two started off with the shock of a freezing cold wake up but was softened some what be being able to play with the local  urlLink   Kangeroos which was great. After breakfast we were off to  urlLink   The Bicentenial Tree which is a 75m tree with a ladder built on the sides. These trees are used for fire lookouts although this one was purley a tourist attraction. I managed to get to 25m before freaking out but Marion made it to the full 75m, crazy or brave, you decide. Later we arrived at the Valley Of The Giants for a  urlLink   tree top walk, personally I was feeling a little jittery about hights by this time so I was very proud to walk round the whole route. The trees were Tingles (nice word) which are amazing trees. Some had the centres burnt out and were so big you could drive a car through them:s Off again to some granite formations known as Elephant Rocks which do look a bit like three elephant bums walking out to see, very nice. Later we saw the  urlLink   Natural Gap which is a huge gap (suprisingly) in a cliff face where the sea crashes in to create very spectacular sea spray, here we also saw a natural rock bridge much like the one on the Great Ocean Road but this one was still standing. Last stop was for the blow holes at Albany which are really quite scary when they get going. They're basically holes in the rock that as the water comes in air is forced out at quite a pace. These particular blow holes were also located pretty close to a cliff face which felt a little hairy. This is where is all went a tab Pete Tong. We got back to the bus to find out that someone had gotten in through the window and pinched out bags, theiven' buggers! Luckily I'd kept my camera, IPod etc. with me so it was only clothes and washing gear really. After a stop off at the local cop shop, who were very nice. We went for a couple of pints and bed.   urlLink   The next day mostly involved a climb up a huge hill to see yet more dizzying heights:s Hmmmmm, yes. There was a very cool balancing rock up there though which we couldn't help but try to knock over, alas to no avail.  urlLink   As usual me misses had to go right up to the top and right up to the edge, I chose the relative saftey amongst some rocks:) Then it was back in the bus for the long drive back to Perth, then a train home, lovely:)

      What a lovely weekend, me and me misses went all the way up to Yanchep in the car to go Camel trecking on Saturday. It was a bit of a drive and Grace wasn't to happy for the most of it but she made it there in the end.  urlLink   There was only the two of us with the camel leader for the whole evening which was really nice and peaceful. The woman that lead the camels was great although she'd only been out leading the camels a couple of times before which meant the lead camel would constantly stop or sit down and refuse to move:) The treck was supposed to be two hours but turned out to be two and a half by the time we got back.  urlLink   It was 4:30pm when we left and we headed of to the beach which we just in time for the sunset. The Indian Ocean looked lovely and the beach was deserted, very picturesque. The seats we sat on were actually quite comfortable, apparantly much better than horse saddles although we did ache a bit when we got off. We  saw some Kangeroos really close up who didn't seem afraid at all.

      In an effort to spend as little money as possible we've been trying to find as many free attractions as possible in Melbourne. The YHA we're staying at has been fantastic with helping us and even gave us free tickets to see "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" which is filmed in Melbourne. So me and me misses tottered off to the channel 9 studios in the afternoon to watch the show. To be honest the set looked pretty tacky but it's amazing how good it looks on film, clever blokes these TV types. Because of where we were sitting we're guaranteed to be on the telly, yay! We even got to press the buttons for not one but two ask the audience questions. What was most frightening was the pack mentality of the applause and the ooooo's and aaaa's, you just can't stop yourself joining in.

      Today we went to the Singapore office and managed to book our flights home. We didn't quite get what we wanted but we now fly out at 00:50 on 6-Jul so we only have around a week to kill in Melbourne. As we're trying to tie up loose ends we went to the National Bank to clode our account. It turns out we only had about $87 left in there anyway but we thought we'd best close it so the teller withdrew the $87 and then tried to clode the account. This is the stupid part, it turns out we owed the bank $16 in fees due to making too many withdrawals in the month! You've got to love Australians.

      We got a taxi at midday to the airport which was an event in itself, we almost left our washing at the YHA in the dryer but luckily Marion recued it at the last moment. We flew with Virgin Blue to Melbourne. A very pleasant flight and nice to be supporting the british industry in Australia, go Rich! Out of the airport and straight onto a shuttle bus and then tram to the YHA. A little smaller place this time and not as new but very clean and quite. As a last treat we went to a local pub called The Town Hall which has absolutely fantastic food. So we ate there and got through a bottle of wine, I even ate my carrots:)

      Just a big drive to Adelaide really, mostly involving lateral thinking puzzles on the bus. We did stop off for a kangaroo pie at a bakery which was very tasty and another stop at a winery. Me and me misses didn't bother with the winery as they seem to glorified bottle shops that let you taste a couple of wines. When we finally got to Adelaide it was all a bit weird after being in the outback for so long. We checked into our YHA which was a great place, huge and all very modern and funky.  urlLink   We met up with everyone from the tour later and went for a Chinese and a few drinks at the pub. A lovely end to the tour:)

      Pancakes for breakfast, hooray for Billie (our tour guide). The rain finally turned up this morning, but managed to ease off by the time we got to Wilpena Pound which is another sort of rock formation. On the way we got to see a sheep that had literally just given birth to it's lamb, we even got to see it's first steps to cries of ooo, aaaaaa:) We even got to see some Read kangaroos boxing, full on, hardcore death match stuff, so that's another box I can tick off:)  urlLink   The climb and Wilpena Pound wasn't too bad until I got about halfway up and we turned a corner. The wind was so strong I really thought I was going to get blown right of the cliff face:( So once again I wimped out and went back down. The rest of the afternoon me and me misses spent in the pub with a nice beer and the log fire so it wasn't all bad.

      We got a view of a bridge that used to be part of the old Ghan Railway. It's dissused now but used to be quite an important trade route.  urlLink   We also got to stop for a dip in a warm spring which was very nice, not hot, just warm. It was a bit sandy and I was a little scared to touch the sides but it did help me to smell a little better, you know how it is when you're on the road:) Lake Eire was our next stop, or at least the Southern part of the two lakes that make up Lake Eire. Even though it was the smaller of the two it was difficult to believe it wasn't the sea, it just went on and on and on. It's not really a salt lake as such but does have small salt deposits, mostly fresh water though. Next we had a quick stop over for  urlLink   Talc Alf, this guy is another one of those living bush legends. He makes scupltures from the rock they use to make Talc from which really are astounding, we even bought one to take home with us. He also has a very interesting way of looking at the way words are formed and the meanings of letters, I can't really describe it here but he really is just a top bloke. Tonight we got another treat by staying in a bunkhouse in Angareachiner in the Flinders Ranges, very picturesque.

      Unfortunately our tour bus got broken into while we were all asleep last night but luckily another tour guide managed to scare them off. They only made it out with the Pictionary which they dropped halfway across the car park. Strangely both me and me misses said we had a better nights sleep in the swags which was strange but maybe a sign that we're becoming true bushmen:) We had a bit of a late start with a nice relaxing tour of the town from the bus which was very interesting. The most expensive house they have in Coober Pedy cost $120,000 and has seven bedrooms. However, due to the high cost of water it costs 8c just to flush the toilet in Coober:) We got to have a look at the underground church which is all hand dug into the shape of a cross and is now used by the Catholics and Buddhists of Coober, what a combination. There used to 40 different nations living in Cobber Pedy but now they're down to 39 as the Eskimo died (I kid you not!). After that we got a tour of a disused mine which was hosted by our pyro maniac guide of Coober (she blew up her dads car when she was seven and started making bombs at four).  urlLink   Coober Pedy certainly has some characters and none of them are more of a character then Crocodile Harry. This guy is seventy years old and lived in a dug out called the crocodiles nest. He used to be a crocodile hunter but takes things at a slower pace now days. His home is filled with various ladies undergarments as well as some 'interesting' photos of visitors;) Very nice bloke though. After a bit of a drive we made it to Williams Creek which has the most remote pub in Australia, apparently. It even has it's own airstrip with a building at the end that has "FLY NOW!" painted on the roof:) Me and me misses went for a quick drink and then headed back to the swags for the night.

      Yet another 5am start, although they do seem to be getting easier. We made it to Mount Conner, nicknamed Fooluru as it looks much the same as Uluru, for sunrise before  urlLink   offloading some of the group at a roadhouse so they could go back to Alice Springs. They were only doing a three and a half day tour and to replace them we picked up a Canadian lass. Next stop was an aboriginal reserve for an art centre which was a bit strange to go around really. The actual reserve is all fenced in, even the buildings inside are fenced in. There's rubbish all over the streets and even a camel, that apparently breaks into the local, was wandering loose. It made me feel very uncomfortable being there but once we got inside I felt a bit better about the whole thing. The art work itself was brilliant, they had some really beautiful exhibits and Marion couldn't resist buying a wooden emu's foot with some burnt in designs, a symbol of power I think the lady said:) There were even some painted tiles, on one of the read "I love Jesus" which promted the question of the effect of missionaries on the reserve. Apparently they did once have a missionary on the reserve but he didn't fit in too well and so his license was revoked, now he's in the process of getting it back. Further along the road we saw a large group of Wedge Tailed Eagles which really are amazing creatures, such a huge wingspan and massive talons. It turned out they were having a bit of a road-kill feast with a roo by the side of the road. We tried to sneak up and get some pictures but they got spooked and flew off:( Before arriving in Coober Pedy we had a quick look at the Breakaways which is a piece of land just outside Coober that's often used in movies. Things like Mad Max, Pitch Black etc. were filmed there, a very desolate place.  urlLink   At Coober Pedy we had time for a quick look at our underground "digs" for the night and then it was out for Pizza, bit of a treat. We also got to meet up with our new traveling companions and went for a drink in the underground bar before turning in.

      We started the day at five in the morning to ensure we made it to Uluru for the sunrise, so it was yet more dew covered swags and shivering around the remaining embers of the fire. The sunrise itself was quite pretty if not a little to busy for my liking. The colours were quite spectacular and the changes as the sun rose were nice to watch but not as amazing as Kings Canyon. After the sun was up we drove up to "the rock" for a walk around the base, we could have opted to walk over the top but chose not to. Interestingly enough the local aborigine's ask you not to climb the rock but people can anyway because the Australian government has a 99 year lease on the place. As luck would have it was too windy for the walk over the top anyway so everyone went around the base. It's quite strange walking round, it takes about three hours if you take your time and is covered in  urlLink   strange formations and sacred sites where you can't take pictures. It really is huge and shaped in a sort of triangle from a birds-eye view. We got to see some of the cave paintings which can't be accurately dated (and looked quite recent to me) as well as the two water holes which the aborigine's would approach in silence as they were also seen as sacred ground. After the walk we visited the Uluru cultural centre which was a very interesting place and we couldn't help but wish we'd been there before seeing the rock but you can't have it all. There were two aboriginal women sat there painting as a sort of living display which made me and me misses feel very uncomfortable. It came across much like a zoo exhibit, very strange. For the afternoon we went for 7.5Km walk around Kata Tjuta (The Olgas). Some of the others had gone back to the rock as the climb had been opened up so me and me misses decided to go around Kata Tjuta with a guy called Paul, his partner was climbing the rock instead.  urlLink   It was a really great walk and was a nice chance to be away from the crowds for a bit:) When we finally made it back to the bus there was just enough time to catch a double sunset over Kata Tjuta and Uluru in the distance, lovely.

      Another early awakening but this time with the wet and cold already condensing on the outside of our swags, hmmmmmm. Saying that, after a spot of breakfast I was feeling a lot more lively and almost looking forward to our three hour walk around Kings Canyon:s The first section of the walk has been kindly named "Heart Attack Hill", which is great for those of us who have a rational, yes that's rational, fear of heights. Still, both me and me misses made it to the top, yay us. Unfortunately the camera didn't, it's finally given up the ghost just one day before we go to Uluru (Ayres Rock), fantastic:( Kings Canyon itself is truly spectacular and an unexpected bonus as we knew little about the place until we actually got there. The rock formations really are beyond words, just spectacular, even a picture can't do the place justice. While we were there we also visited the Garden Of Eden which is a pool of water with some beautiful plant life surrounding it all nestled in a sort of valley section of Kings Canyon. One of our slightly crazier traveling companions went for a swim, the verdict was "very cold". After a sport of lunch we set of for Uluru collecting some firewood along the way during which a managed to lacerate myself multiple times, but as we say, "it's for the group".  urlLink   The sunset at Uluru was fantastic, although after spending the day at Kings Canyon we were both slightly disappointed with the grandeur of the place. Still, when in Oz:)

      It was an early wake up at the Pioneer YHA backpackers in Alice Springs, sneaking out past our room mate with all our gear trying our best not to wake him up. It was certainly a cold morning which certainly helped with the waking up process. We met the bus on time at 6:50am and spent a while going around the rest of Alice doing pickups before checking in at the tour office and paying up the last of the price. On the way to our first stop we saw some wedge tailed eagles which are really spectacular animals as well as what looked like wild camels but the paddock's are so huge out in the outback it could have been part of someone's property.  urlLink   To get to Rainbow rock we had to switch busses as it meant a bit of off road driving for a while. The rock itself is so called because of the stripes of colour caused by the iron coming out of the rock with the water as it is evaporated. It was also our first experience of the deep red coloured sand that covers the area.  urlLink   When we got back to the cafe where the busses are changed back we also got a chance to meet Dinky the Singing Dingo. Apparently a bush legend in his own time, Dinky howls along to people playing the piano and even tinkles the ivories himself from time to time. After arriving at the William Creek camp ground for the night we had to set up our swags which are essentially a large canvass sleeping bag with a bit of padding on the bottom. You put your sleeping bag inside these and that's it for the night, just a campfire, your swag, and the stars, lovely. Before turning in we had a quick drive up to Kings Canyon for the sunset where you can see the classic red-rock effect then it was back for marshmallows round the campfire before bed:)

      Today was just crazy. We started off at around nine or ten by moving out of our friends place who's put us up for the last few nights and has been an absolute star (you know who you are). After checking in to the YHA we had a frenzy of booking flights and tours which are all now fully paid up and ready. It did take us quite a while as we had to to and fro between the flight center and the YHA where we booked the tour. Then we got the car from her secret hiding place (AKA the sports ground) and emptied the contents into the hostel ready for selling and sending to the charity shops. This is where it all got a little bit sad as it was time to say goodbye to Grace the fabulous Cortina. She's done well over siz thousand miles in our service and when we finally found a wreackers that would take her it was a very sad moment. Neither me or me misses managed to keep our eyes dry. A bit pathetic you may think, but we'd been through many good and bad times together and travelled from one side of Australia to the other. You're bound to form a bit of a sybyotic link after that:) So with her number plates tucked under our arms we ot the bus home recounting tales of the godd times and the bad, bless her. To round the day off we managed to sell our tent and most of our other (now useless) gear at Cash Converters. They did only pay a fraction of the price but when you're flying out in two days, $63 ain't bad. So tonight will you all raise your glasses with us as we toast Grace, our first and forever dearest little car. Beep, beep!

      So, for those of you who haven't been keeping up to date (shame on you), I shall recap. Our accommodation fell through due to our landlord being a jerk, and that's being nice about it. This inevitably led to my job falling through and after trying to resolve the matter professionally we've reached a stalemate. So the upshot of this is that me and the misses are leaving Freo this Friday. That's right folks,  this  Friday. We're flying out to Alice first and spending one night there. We then leave on an eight day tour through Uluru, Cooper Pedy and much more, finishing up at Adelaide. We'll then spend one night in Adelaide before leaving the next morning for a flight to Melbourne. Upon arrival in Melbourne we'll have a few days to chill before flying back home. We may or may not be spending some time in Singapore to chill out before arriving home, but I'll keep ya'll updated. So far we plan to be getting home sometime on Friday the 2nd of July but this will be confirmed nearer the time.

      Don't know if I got round to mentioning it earlier but about a week back someone spiked our tire with a screwdriver, they did the same to a load of cars on the street so I don't think we were targeted. So on Saturday morning me and me misses went out change it for the spare, took us a while to figure out how the jack worked, it was one of those that works a bit like a lever with the side of the car as the fulcrum. So we may not have a spare tire anymore but Grace is back on the road, yay:)

      It was an early morning start at the YHA, Fremantle made easier when we were presented with a free breakfast, yum, yum. We caught the train from Freo (all very surreal being up and active early in the morning), then an Airport Shuttle from the station in Perth to the Domestic Airport. We chose not to use the Freo Shuttle as my ex psycho boss runs it and I wouldn't trust him not to dump us in the middle of nowhere. It was actually all a very cleansing experience and we both felt very relaxed being driven around Perth doing pickups here and there. That is, until some white van man smashes the wing mirror off the Shuttle Bus, bit of a shock but we carried on anyways:)  urlLink   The plane to Alice was tiny, not like those tiny light aircraft but more of a little jet, quite sweet really. The flight lasted two and a half hours from Perth to Alice Springs, which is a tiny little airport, just right for our plane. The YHA we stayed in for the night was clean and pleasant. We actually spent most of the night down the pub where I had kangaroo with a red wine glaze and Marion had Camel with chili sauce. The kangaroo was great, really sweet and melt in the mouth tasty. Marion drew the short straw with the camel though, it was just like a really old, cheap bit of beef steak. After eating we retired to the bar where we met a lovely couple who were staying in Alice while doing some mining work, then it was back for some sleep before the next early wake up call.

      Me and me misses had agreat night last night down at Clancy's Fish Pub. I may, have mentioned Clancy's before but for the uneducated it's a great little pub that also has a very seafood orientated menu, all very tasty too. Last night we ended up there after I finished work and settled down to a slightly less carbonated beer than you may find elsewhere in ther colonies. This was when the never ending rain cloud that seems to be covering Freo at present decided to start up emptying itslef directly on top of Clancy's, lovely. However it all turned out in our favour as there happened to be the best jazz/funk quartet playing that very night. They really were fantastic, the bass player was doing the funky dipping head thing and the keyboard player aside from being truely great was also a complete seventies throwback. Fantastic.

      Today me and the misses had a day out in Northampton which turned out to be rather successful. Me misses got her ears pierced and got some research done at the library for some writing she's been doing, I got some new t-shirts and we even got a pint of Old Pecuiliar on tap before catching the bus back home:)

      Today was the day of walking around Lubinham looking at peoples gardens. This is some country practise that I have never come accross before in my life. It works by you paying an entrance fee which then allows you access to not only Lubenham Hall garden but also pretty much everyones gardens in the whole village. Some of these gardens are actually quite interesting, if you really make an effort, but some really are just run of the mill back gardens with a few tomatoes and a rather sad looking lawn, oh well, each to their own:)

      After a great night with all the family we were awoken to the smell of pancakes with real maple syrup from Canada. Now personally I never really liked maple syrup but this stuff was really great, not as sweet as the stuff you get over here. We then set off on a walk around the reservoir at Ravensthorpe which is a really lovely walk with dragon flies, ducks and a whole host of fishermen out on the res. Coton Manor Gardens is on the way back from the reservoir, I've been there before with just Marion so it was great to give my parents a chance to see it as well. It really is a lovely place, they have flamingo's and ducks and any plant you could wish to name. It's been divided up so you almost have rooms in the whole garden which adds a beautiful sense of intimacy. On arrival back at the house me misses once again excelled herself by cooking everyone a slap up cooked breakfast.

      The jet lags really hit us now, it's really not that bad, just bouts of letharyafter eating and at other more random times. We've managed to combat the worst effects with pleanty of lounging and drinking;) My parent made it up along with Marions dad and his partner and we had a really great night all together. Me misses cooked a great dinner for everyone and they all seemed to have a really good night.

      We arrived in Singapore a little worse for wear but by the time we'd found our next departure gate and had a sit down it was time to leave again. I think we both knew that the second leg of the journey was going to be a bad one and in some way we were right. It wasn't too bad for most of the journey as we had on-demand movies and food to keep us occupied but soon the cabin fever started kicking in and then we realized we couldn't get any sleep:( Me misses faired worse than myslef as I managed to get in some power napping which worked really well. Things were then made slightly worse as we approached Heathrow as we hit some fairly nasty turbulence which left us both feeling pretty rough by the time the plane hit the tarmac. We got picked up by Marions mum and her partner as we'll be spending the next few weeks at their place. Withen two hours we'd got back to the house, had a quick shower and then it was straight to the pub for our first English pint in nine months, beatiful.

      Well people, we made it to Singapore. We'll be boarding soon for the last leg back to the UK, can't wait for that English pint. We've already stocked up on duty free baccy which should last us a few weeks at least and might even splash out on a new camera to replace the broken one when we get to the Heathrow side:) Here's to on-demand movies and classic NES games courtesy of Singapore Airlines:)

Can't wait to get back, both me and me misses are loking forward to a warm pint, some chips and a cigarette all in the same place;)

      Just had a loung around today and watched some movies. Pass It Forward was a truelly great movie. It has the "I see dead people" kid and leaves you with a nice warm glow. Then we watched Monsters Inc, tee hee hee, I like that movie:)

      Finally got down to the Vic Roads office this morning and unregistered Grace (our Cortina). It was really weird as it was the same place we went to transfer the ownership when we bought her. It seems to be a running theme at the moment of coming full circle which is nice in a way as we feel we've succeeded. A bit like 80 days around the world:) We also got a few of our disposable cameras developed today, the pictures aren't great but at least we have some I suppose.

      We started of the day at the Ian Potter art centre which is one of the very modern looking buildings in the main square near Flinders Street station. The first two floors were free and the third was a pay for entry exhibition. We managed to do the whole ground floor but had to leave to make it to the Parliment building in time for a tour. The tour was also free (just about our limit at the moment) and actually quite informative. The Parliment building in Melbourne was actually used as the Australian Parliment building until they'd built the one in Canberra so there's actually quite a bit of history behind it. The gold leaf everywhere is quite striking and is apparently worth about $3,000,000 on the modern gold market:) We ounded off our day with steak and a couple of beers on the way back.
