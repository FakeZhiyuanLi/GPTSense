      I updated  urlLink Lukewarm Snow  today!  Lots of new stuff.  Last night I crashed at Groff's house, we played Super Smash Bros Melee, PSO, and got pissed off at Ikaruga.  Joel walked in at about midnight and we decided to go to Taco Bell.  We got 3 grande combos that were completely demolished.  Jesse and Sara are back together.  She was waiting for him when we got off work.  Tonight I'm going out with the gang to see Shrek 2, I hope it's as funny as the first one!  I helped my grandparents clean out their garage and I found a stop sign that my dad and uncles had stolen when they were my age as well as a sign that says "This establishment condemned."  And, we opened our pool today!  That's all for now, gotta get ready for work.

      I'm home.  Finally.  It was getting to be a little crazy.  It's so nice to be home and see everyone again.  I missed Audra soo much, when I got home I went over there and we went to the ice cream social and then rented Pirates of the Caribbean because we both hadn't seen it yet.  Well, I'd seen the first 20 mins or so before but was dead tired and passed out.  It just felt good to be back again.  I think staying at hotels was starting to get to me because the night we got home I was in bed and I remember thinking "Wow, this is a really nice hotel."  At which point I realized I was in my own room.  Our pictures are being developed now so I'll upload those later when I get them.  We only have about ten rolls of film -_-;;  I'm sure you've listened to my audioblogger comments.  There were a few days when I didn't have cell phone service at all so that's why there seems to be holes in our itinerary.  But um, those last couple the ones that sound like Indian music.  Those are fake.  It's from a cd, it was a joke to Dan lol  Yesterday afternoon Coty and I drove up to Beldan to buy games.  He got Front Mission 4 and I got the retro series Zelda for GBA.  Coty was so excited about this game, because he hasn't bought a new game in quite some time.  Well, he gets home and finds out that his younger brother left the PS2 at his uncles in Canton!  So it sux to be him.  He said he read the manual about eight times now lol  Last night I went over to Dan's to run for CC.  Turns out he's at Sean's because Sean's family is out of town and he had the house to himself so of course he invited a bunch of friends over.  Dan got the Zelda four swords game for GCN.  Trust me I had my doubts about this game.  It seemed kinda dumb from the screen shots but once you actually play it, it's fun!  It's really sorta addicting too.  I wanna play more!

      Audra and I went to the movies on Friday.  We saw Mean Girls.  I thought it was gonna be really corny, but it has Lindsey Lohan in it so it couldn't be  that  bad right?  Well, it was surprisingly funny!  It was a really good movie, I recommend it.  Afterwards we went back to her house and watched Leno for a bit before I had to go home.  Yesterday Dan and I ran again and at least it wasn't raining like Friday.  It was rather nice out and we ran for more than the required 30 minutes.  It ended up being something like 50 mins, but we walked for about 5 so a total of 45 minutes running.  We have to push ourselves though because we just found out that the school has hired a new track and cross country coach.  He's a triathlete and a marathon runner!!  We are gunna die -.-;;  Yesterday, after running, Dan, Sean and I went up to Borders to get one of my summer reading novels, but I ended up getting a cd instead.  I bought Jet, the Get Born album.  Dan burnt a bunch of cds from his collection for me.  Now I have Flogging Molly, Lost Prophets and Sugarcult!  HUZZAH!  We went to this new plaza next to Borders.  It has an Ice Cream Shoppe (notice the old-english spelling) and a Verizon Wireless store and an EBgames.  I got the Super Mario retro series game for Game Boy Advance.  I actually found a copy of the original Final Fantasy for NES, but it was $35 so I decided not to.  I saw copies of it on ebay for 15 bucks.  We found some really stupid books at Borders, I was looking for books on Atlantis and we stumbled upon one called "Children of the Matrix: How an inter-dimensional race has been controlling us for thousands of years, and still does" or something like that.  Published in 2001.  If it was made before the movie, maybe it would've been an interesting idea, but as is, a giant load of bullshit.  After I took Dan and Sean back to Dan's house, Audra and I came back over here and we watched my Raiders of the Lost Ark dvd because she's never seen the Indy movies before.  I had to take her home after the movie because she's leaving for Girl's State today and she wasn't done packing yet.  When I dropped her off, we sat in my car in the driveway awhile and talked, then we had a goodbye kiss.  I'm gonna miss her these next two weeks.    So, this ends my last post from home for the next two weeks.  I'll continue to post from my cell phone and audioblogger to keep you guys up to date on my latest adventures.  Oh! One more crazy thought before I go.  One my way to Dan's to go running, there was a 5 year old kid karate-kicking his mailbox.  Then, while we ran on Friday in the rain, a field of cows herded close together and just stared at us.  Creepy.  Cya!

      Work was stupid again last night, as per usual.  I want to talk to my boss about being a waiter, that’s where the money is.  Being a bus boy sucks ass.  How hard is it to be a waiter?  Not only do they make more in tips in one day than I make in 2 weeks, but we do all their work!  I think they should at least share the tips.  I talked to the manager about it and she said they had a male host/seater before and it “didn’t work.”  Well, I don’t want to be a seater, I want to be a waiter.  You know what’s retarded?  If the waitresses sell desserts to the customers, they get gift certificates.  How gay is that?!  While the bus boys are there 2 hours after closing, cleaning up their shit that their too lazy to do cause they wanna get out of there ASAP.  I need a new job before I go insane.  I want to work at Blockbuster.  They get to preview all the new movies and games.  Plus, I could work during the week instead of always weekends.  I need a better job because I need to buy things.  DVDs League of Extraordinary Gentlemen LOTR: ROTK Matrix 1-3 Last Samurai Kill Bill Pirates of the Caribbean  Games Van Helsing Used Nintendo  Books 3 summer reading novels for AP English  CDs Sugarcult Lost Prophets Lenny Kravitz New Found Glory Jet Beastie Boys Franz Ferdinand  BIG THINGS *Computer* -this comes before all else, except maybe CDs and summer reading Bookcase New scanner for my as-of-now-non-existent-computer   Audra and I talked on the phone for hours last night.  It was so nice, to have a girl to talk to that understands you.  She understands what I’m saying and she has her own unique points of view.  Tonight we might go see a movie.  I don’t know what though.  The Stepford Wives looks interesting.  I haven’t decided if it’s a comedy or horror.  The trailers confuse me.  The Day After Tomorrow is supposed to be really good too.  I need to talk to Audra about what she’d like to see.  I was watching the MTV video-music awards last night and there are so many movies that I want to see but haven’t got a chance to yet.  Like, The Matrix Revolutions, Kill Bill 1 & 2, The Last Samurai, Pirates of the Caribbean, and I haven’t even seen The Passion of the Christ yet!  I also want to see Dawn of the Dead, that’s supposed to be really good.  At exactly 7:49 am this morning, I got a txt message from Brenton: “I COULD B UR PUNK ROCK PRINCESS IF U COULD B MY GARAGE BAND KING LOL.”  I have only one response: “WTF?!”  Apparently, he’s been over at Jen’s since early this morning.  I asked him what the quote was about and he had no idea.  Maybe Jen sent it?  I have no idea.  Vacation is so close I can smell it!  It smells like a morning sunrise lol.   Gonna work on deviantart stuff now and call Audra, smell ya later.

I want them all to shrivel up and die!  Leave me alone!  If I want porn, I can find it on my own. >  I bet these people are in cohoots with the hippies.

      We were rained out Day 3 or running yesterday, and tonight I might have to work so Dan and I ran in the morning.  We both managed to wake up at 5:30 and then we met at the track @ 6.  We ran about a mile and a half.  The mosquitos were incredibly annoying.  The little buggas hurt when they bite!  I don't remember it hurting like that before.  It was like a bee sting.  Which by the way, I was stung by a bee yesterday afternoon.  WE had just gotten home from the lake.  Coty, his brother, and my sister and her friend and I went again.  The sunburn from the first day at the lake is killing me now.  Anyway, just got back and my sister and I decide to take a dip in the pool to wash off.  Afterwards, she goes inside and I went to turn off the pool heater and pump. (I almost typed "pimp" instead of "pump" lol)  Well, I was walking back to the house and I got stung by some bastard bee.  I even had flip flops on.  I swear, Mother Nature must be out to get me or something.  After we ran today, Dan, Audra and I went out to breakfast.  We went to Steinbecks's Bakery in Mineral City.  That place is so cheap!  Large Coffee-$.75 Glazed Donuts-$.30 each.  I got two glazed donuts, a large coffee and I even got a dozen M&M cookies on the way out for $2.40!  All in all, I spent only a little over 3 bucks.  Amazing.  I don't know how they stay in business.  They had a huge selection of donuts too.  And plus, they're only open from 5-2!  Crazy!  They must have lots and lots of customers.  Hopefully I don't have to work tonight.  The manager didn't have the schedule up last Sunday so I have to check it this afternoon when I go to get my check.  If I don't work, Audra and I are going to the movies.  Maybe then I can buy a used Nintendo at Gamestop.  And maybe even a couple games, I mean, they're only 2-3 bucks each.  I'm thinking Metroid, and maybe, Excitebike?  That is, if they have them.  Oh!  They have Gauntlet!  Maybe I'll get that.  Gotta save some cash back for mom's b-day gift, and vacation.  Gonna go nurse my bee sting now.  You outta see how swelled-up my toe is.  I got stung on the long toe next to the big one.  It's so puffy and now it's hella-itchy.  Smell ya later

      Well, I think Kacy and I are good now.  We were talking online last night and she was saying that some people pulled up in a Jeep, and pitched a tent in their front yard!  They had a clothesline, a fire, and everything!  She said that if they whipped out the guitar, that she was going to go live with someone else until they leave.  Apparently they're friends of her Dad's friends.  He doesn't even know them!  Damn hippies...  Ok, I want you to look at  urlLink this  and tell me if you see Atlantis there.  Apparently, I'm the only one who doesn't see it.  This is important, because if those stupid scientists managed to find Atlantis before me this means I'm gonna either have to wipe their memories and claim responsibility for the discovery or invent a time machine.  I don't think there's anything there.  All I see is little squiggly lines.  Stupid full-o-shit scientists.  Oh man, my quads hurt really bad today.  I even took care to stretch more yesterday, but I'm still sore.  Got go run early today because I have to go get my haircut and then we're going to visit my great-grandmother in the hospital.  She's supposedly gotten pneumonia.  I hope she pulls thru.  She's 93 and in incredibly good health for her age.  She only complains about not being able to see as well and her fingers don't function as well as they used to, which is a shame because she loves to crochet.  But she's a fighter.  She'll make it.  I'm gonna go.  Thinking of playing Indiana Jones on PS2 or drawing comics for a little bit.  But before I go, a shopping list!  (I get paid Thursday) -New (used) Nintendo, my old one finally gave up the ghost -Summer reading novels for AP English -Birthday gift for mom -Father's day gift for dad -try to save as much as possible for trip, computer, etc  I really need to hurry up and save enough for that new comp.  This one is getting really bad with the crashing and freezing. >  Smell ya later

      Ok, so day 2 or cross country training wasn't as bad as day 1.  Dan didn't die today.  We ran in the gravel pit across the street instead of down the road.  Much more fun.  Better scenary and more, uh adventurous?  Jumping over the rocks and running next to the river.  I played FFXI a little bit before and after running.  I leveled my new Elvaan redmage guy to 5.  Justin and Amy were there, but they didn't run.  They walked behind us and after we were done, they were down in the pit and Dan went after them but the bugs were annoying me so I went back for FFXI.  Well soon after they came back, they urged me to leave so they could talk.  Now I'm talking to Dan and he's upset cause everything isn't shibby.  I talked online with him for awhile and calmed him down tho.  Anyways, went to visit Audra again today.  She said the medication stuff is wearing off and now her mouth is starting to hurt bad.  She seems to be getting better tho.  Hopefully she'll feel ok for Girl's State next week.  That reminds me!  I can't believe it's already time for vacation.  I'm really excited now that it's closer to the date.  I signed up for audio blogger so I can update from the road.  Then you all get to hear my voice instead of reading my stupid ramblings. XD  I need to go to bed.  I'm so tired.  Today Brenton, my sister and her friend and I went to the lake to swim.  We were out there for most of the day.  But man, my freckles are back in full force now.  Dosen't take much sun for them to go crazy.  I got burnt on my back tho, sun lotion must've washed off in the water.  ugh. bed. now. smell ya later

      I have a lot to update on.  First and foremost, Audra and I are together.  We kept seeing each other at different places, and then it just sorta happened at Alisha's party.  She came over last night, and she's been over to meet the folks before, this was just to hang out.  Brenton, Coty, and Dan came swimming and we had fun, but next time, I want it to be just her and I.  After everyone left, she handed me a note and a bag of Hershey's kisses.  She said they were for all the times we wouldn't be able to kiss in the coming weeks with her surgery, girl's state, and my vacation.  I should be so creative.  I'm so happy with her right now.  She's pretty, smart, down to earth, and she's good at video games.  It took awhile, but I found a good one this time. :)  In other news, I discovered that people who I thought were my friends apparently hate me.  Kacy and Tanya think I'm an ass because Kacy liked me, but I just want to be her friend.  I never went out with every girl I really liked, why should they hate me because I won't go with her?  You know, when everyone was mad at Kacy for drinking and smoking at the party, I was the only one who stood up for her.  I was like, lay off guys, let her be.    It's just that when I'm around them, they put on a mask.  They act all friendly around me, then when I turn around they're completely different.  I would've never found out if I hadn't read Kacy's  urlLink livejournal .  Can someone find me some antiseptic?  I've just been stabbed in the back!  I've now read thru some posts at Tanya, Kacy, and Sean's journals.  There is so much of them just complaining about how their life sucks.  I'm sorry, I can't handle you people anymore.  I try so hard to be nice and I always make sure that everyone knows exactly how I feel, but no one else seems to give me the same courtesy.  The least they could do is talk to me, I don't live far away, and they know my number.  But no, they sit at home in the dark and type away about me.  At least I still have friends that tell me when they have a problem with me instead of talking behind my back.  Great, now I feel bad for writing all this.  Why do I always do that?  Why do I have to be the nice guy?  Screw it, I'm gonna go run, smell ya later

      Sorry for not posting lately.  I haven't been able to get on our computer since last Friday.  I downloaded a spyware protection program from AOL and it screwed up our computer.  Mom messed with it and then tried calling the customer service rep.  Apparently, they've been having trouble with that program.  I was like "So, if they still have bugs to work out, why do they have it out there still?"  Mom ended up just taking it into work to have one of their techies look at it.  Hopefully it's better tonight, cause I need to download Snood!  Dan has it on one of his laptops and now I'm addicted to it.  My sister is hooked on Animal Crossing again, so no Gamecube for me.  I've actually been working on my comics though.  I have 3 pages of Realm Riders penciled out.  This sucks, I have to get this comic done by Saturday, but I don't want to rush it, not for the judges, I want to do this comic really good because I'm excited about the story and characters.  I mean, if you can't get excited about your own work, how is someone else going to?  Last night, Audra was having girls night, so I went over to Dan's with Coty and we all drive up to see Anchorman.  Right before we left, we got online to fandango.com and looked up the movie times.  It said it started at 7:50.  Well I didn't manage to get a good look at it.  I thought it was playing at Tinseltown.  We got there on perfect time and I walked up to the ticket counter.  "One for Anchorman please" "Anchorman is not playing here.  It is at movies 10."  The lady was really rude.  So we were like crap, now we had to back track to Movies 10.  So we get to Movies 10, and there's only 1 ticket counter opened and theres a big line.  We thought we'd never make it.  Luckily tho, we got our tickets and got in there in time to see the movie.  The previews were just ending as we sat down.  But man, oh man, Anchorman has to be *the* funniest movie I have *ever* seen.  I've never laughed so hard, so long in a movie theater.  It was just continous jokes after another.  Especially the part at the end with the dog and the bear.  It was so hilarious.  GO SEE IT NOW!!!  I'm finally getting my own computer!!!  I have enough in both savings accounts to buy it now, but I want to continue to save until September or October as I originally planned so I don't have to totally empty my savings.  I hope this link works, but  urlLink THIS  is the computer I'm going for.  Sexy huh?

      Wow.  Ever since I got back from vacation, I just haven't been in the blogger-mood.  Even so, a lot of interesting things have been happening here lately.  I think it was last weekend, Audra and I rode the 4-wheeler at her house.  There are so many trails out there, way more than we have in our woods.  We also went to see Dodgeball which has to be one of the funniest movies I've seen.  "Donde esta en la biblioteca." lol!    Then, Wednesday we had Cross Country practice.  It was really dark and looked like the sky would just open up and spew rain like a motha' but it ended up not raining until practice was nearly over.  Justin had another episode and they had to call an ambulance this time.  He stopped breathing 3 times and finally regained consciousness on the way to the hospital.  Dan was, well, distraught to say the least.  He later said that Justin's pupils actually disappeared during the ordeal.  That's intense.  Needless to say, Dan went to the hospital, and I went to his house to inform his parents as to what happened, and to shut down his computer.  (btw-Justin's fine now, it was an allergic reaction to something, the doctors aren't sure)    It just so happens that as I was pulling out of Dan's driveway, a car is passing by and it puts it's blinker on and turns into Dan's drive.  Finally, I realized it was Audra!  She just happened to be passing by on her way home from her sister's house.  I followed her home so she could drop off her car, and then we went to my house to swim, which didn't last long because I forgot to turn the pool heater on that day and the water was kinda chilly, plus it began to storm.  Once we got out of the pool, we decided to watch Monster's Inc. because she'd never seen it.  Let's see, what else?... Yesterday I had to work, my first day back at the job, and it was so hot in the kitchen.  The exhaust fan had just stopped working that day and it was a veritable sauna in there.  I was like "You know guys, I've been in the desert for 2 and a half weeks and it's hotter in here!"  Everyone was sweating profusely.  Even my earlobes were sweating.  It was horrible, I just kept drinking water to keep from passing out.  I started to loose my focus at times.  Last night, my 4H advisor Jill IMed me.  She told me that project judging is Saturday the 17th.  Great, completely forgot about that one.  Now I have to pull an art project out of my ass in a week.  Lovely.  Arghh, I wanna talk to Audra, but she spent the night at Abbey's last night and I'm kinda nervous to call over there this early.  I wish she'd call... Maybe if I send telepathic messages?
