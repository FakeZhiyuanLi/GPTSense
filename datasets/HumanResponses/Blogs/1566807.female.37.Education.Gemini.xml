      ...and so the fun commences...  Sitting here in a state of advanced coma...the surveyor's just been to look at the house to see if it's worth what the ITSC is paying for it. Bastard wouldn't even give me a clue about what he thought re. value, though. I wonder if he saw the patch of dodgy plaster under the window in the spare room? I artfully positioned a whole load of flat-pack boxes in front of it last night. Bet it made not one iota of difference.  So Heff and I have spent the last two days working our butts off to get the place looking like a viable home - rather than a slum we're only temporarily camping out in. House looks GREAT: it's  clean ; we have a living room - with a sofa and everything *gasp* (except a telly *mutters*);  we've done most of the washing; there's no cat-fur-tumble-weed under the beds; the study is organised and tidy; Heff has his own desk to pile stuff on; even the garden got a bit of a once-over.   We finally made it to bed at 3 this morning.  We're TOTALLY FUCKED!!  Heff just went to the Co-op to get some bits for dinner - he looks like an extra from 'Night of the Living Dead'. I hope he doesn't wander under a bus, or anything - he's got his discman on, so he won't be able to hear the screams (most unlike Heff).  In other news, we are approaching solvent - yay!! Heff still hasn't heard anything about his carer's allowance: expect some kickass will be happening in the not-too-dostant-future. Currently, he's stock piling games for when I start writing; though he's itchy about getting his PC down here  - as mine, apparently, is crap.   (Does everything I want it to..well, eventually.)  (Usually, that is.)  (Except when it's having a pissy day or freaking out.)   *sigh*  Anyway, I reckon we're almost at carpet-ripping out point. I am DYING to get rid of all the bloody woodchip. Give us both something positive to focus on: actual, visible, progress forward will be a refreshing change.  Met Sid's (bro's) dog Marley on Sunday. He is adorable: chews everything in sight; drinks from your glass if you don't watch him like a hawk; and farts like the Devil. But I wanna dog, now. Fat chance. I can't even have a tarantula anymore (lifelong ambition) as Heff is....well, not good around spiders. *pout*  Fishtank?  Heff's put up the  Lord of the Rings  poster we bought (for 10p - how could we resist?!) in the study. So now I have a collection of Nazgul, Uruk-Hai and Orcs glowering down at me: most off-putting. Though one of them does have this cool piercing: a bloody-great chain running from his nose-ring to a ring through his eyebrow. Nonetheless, every time I look up, Sauron is giving me this knowing, disapproving, look - like he knows about all the stuff I have 'not quite got around to' yet and should be getting on with.    "Paranoia, paranoia, la-la-la-la-la..."   Here comes Heff. OMIGOD he looks terrible. Though very cute in the hoodie of mine he has adopted. Poor baby. Tho I notice tiredness makes him grumpy, monosyllabic - and not horny!! *gasp* Yes, there is actually something that prevents Heff from getting horny. Who'da thunk it?  George wasn't very popular this morning when he trampled us awake half an hour before we actually had to wake up. He loves Heff: always makes a bee-line for the small piece of the top of his head that sticks out from under the duvet. Then he paws at it and, as soon as Heff blearly pokes his head out, George droolz freely all over him or huffs rotting-cat-breath up his nose. I'm used to it; but it makes me queasy. I can imagine how thrilled Heff must be.  That bloody cat is also eating us out of house and home again: he's troughing down food faster than we can buy it! Yesterday, between the time we got home from town, until we went to bed (about 8 hours) the little sod et 6 pouches of food. That was on top of the third of a can of whiskas, foil tray of chicken-flavoured Felix and ENTIRE can of tuna he'd already eaten in the morning before we went out.   Watching him slam down his fourth pouch last night Heff said, "what's he doing with it all?" Sadly, I suspect the answer is 'depositing it in next-door's flowerbeds'. Well, the evidence would suggest so: there are no cat turds in OUR garden...  Not that I'm complaining, you understand.  I reckon he (George) must have reached maximum density yesterday and is still full: I gave him chunks in slimey oog this morning and he sucked off all the oog and left the chunks.  He is putting on weight like the clappers, though. Thank God. His occasional 'cat impersonation' is starting to look quite realistic, now.  Noelly is coming over for dinner tonight - the first time since he moved out. It will be good to see him; I'm a bit worried about him, as he was quite low over the weekend. I think that, now that the dust is beginning to settle, he's finally getting the tiime for the break-up and the move to sink in and start to affect him. He thinks he should be over it by now; but we were together for a pretty long time (by his standards, at least) and I think he's being a bit hard on himself. These things take time; and he's coped pretty well so far. Especially considering that he never wanted us to break up in the first place. All in all, he's adjusted pretty well - apart from the odd wobble. I just hope that seeing the house all changed, and me with Heff in it,  won't make him feel squicky.  It's hard, coz we still love each other lots; tho, in my case, it's not the same any more. But I still care deeply about the little sod and want him to get on with his life and be happy. I hope he gets round to starting some of his art stuff soon. This was, after all, one of the major reasons for him being on his own.  *sigh*  So, anyway,  I'm making Moussaka for dinner. Interesting to see whether Heff will eat aubergines...   Still, if he won't, George will: save us a few quid on Whiskas.  So, I better go get on with roasting aubergines and slicing potatoes, then, I guess. Sooner I've done it, the sooner I can crawl back into my pit for a few extra hours' sleep...  ....aahhh....sleeep.....sleeeeeep.....Sleeee...*nods*....zzzzzzz.....*unk*.....noooooo......must cook..dinna...  *sigh*  Pity - the kitchen's SOOOOO unbelievably clean, I don't wanna use it! Coz then I'll just have to clean the bloody thing again.  *gloom*  Ah, the endless futility of housework.

      *mumbles incoherently*  It's WAY too early to be doing this; but the postie woke us up at 7.20 (on a SATURDAY!! The bastard) and I couldn't get back to sleep.  Coffee might kick in in a bit.  Besides, it's the first time I've made it out of bed before noon all week: so much to do, just wanted to pull the duvet back over my head and hope it all went away.  But I am a grownup....*sigh*  No, really...  Lost it bigtime last night: like I say, slightest thing; and the cabs round here suck ass to the hugest extent. Felt bad about pissing Noel about; but don't know if anyone else was out anyway. In any case, the expedition was abruptly abandoned when I snapped and stomped off. It was either that or strangle someone. Anyone.  But ended up spending the evening down at the docks - but with Heff. Having him along on one of my night-time wanderings was odd. It's still like being on my own - in a good way: he doesn't distract me by babbling; and it takes away the howling sense of aloneness. Kinda like being able to clear my head; but still feeling safe and warm. Talked lots about stuff: he's definitely making an effort on the communication front.  The improvement is palpable.   Of course, ended up walking home - the cab co. having fucked up (again: I wonder if three times in one night is a record?) and pretty much went straight to bed. I feel very close to him, just at the moment.  Spent all night cuddled up together: niether of us got much sleep; but it was luvverly. I feel so fiercely protective of him: it's good to have someone to love and look out for; and to be given the same in return. It's not like we NEED each other; just that we want to be together and we care about each other; and it's balanced - reciprocal and equal. I like that neither of us is responsible for the other to a greater extent (if that makes any sense). It's just so comfortable and harmonious being together; no nagging irritations or annoyances. Beyond the little domestic stuff that I will beat out of him eventually, of course!! (but he's even pretty good at that, when he puts his mind to it and can be arsed).  Paradoxically, life seems to be going pretty well at the moment: stuff is getting sorted. The 'for sale' board came down at last; I spoke to Paul (soon-to-be-ex-landlord) and have more faith that it's actually going to happen. Dee seems pretty confident - beyond the odd wobble that Paul's gonna pull a fast one. I'm dying to get the carpet up and start cleaning the tiles...  Also, the benefits people seem to be getting their shit together: they sent me a massive cheque on Thursday; so we went out and spent some of it to celebrate. Heff wanted 'viking' lego; but when we got to the toyshop, we discovered it was playmobile (not the same, apparently).  So I made him buy a pair of leather trousers instead!  I just bundled him into the shop and made him try some on before he'd had a chance to think about it. Once he saw how cool they were, he caved totally.  I had to totally spring it on him because I know what he's like:  "Heff, would you like some nice leather trousers?"  "Yeah, that would be the cool."  "So, shall we go and buy you some, then?"  "Let's wait until we've got some money and everything's sorted."   *kiss on top of head*  Arrrgh.   Sensible's all very well; but getting a Heff in leather is far more important! He looks amazing in 'em. Makes a change to see him in clothes that actually fit, rather than the baggy-arsed, three sizes too big, stuff he usually wears. His pant-melons look just great...*lustful sigh*  I'm collecting Duckula videos. I saw one on eBay for a quid; and it seems I went ahead and bought a whole load. Oooops! It was a bit like what happens when I go into a bookshop: I remember going in; then everything's this fuzzy blur, until I find myself standing out on the pavement again - clutching a whole load of heavy bags with a slightly melty credit-card...  I'm reading a fascinating book on the 'Search for Frankenstien', all about Mary Shelley's tour up the Rhine and the infamous summer at the Villa Diodati. It puts a whole new spin on the whole 'birth of horror' stuff: always sounded a weeny bit too perfect and convenient to me. The author's field is eastern European folklore/culture; he wrote a similar book on Dracula that I must now get my hands on. I really need to get the discs out, dust off the research, and think a bit more about the vampire book again; have to do some serious updating; but I still reckon I could sell it. IF I can finally finish it. Might even still do as a doctoral thesis - with a bit more primary research: have to contact UE and see what they say. If I can get on with the research without officially registering, I'll save myself a fortune in tuition fees.  At least my brane seems slowly to be coming round. Finally, I am able to start thinking properly and follow an argument again.   It's strange: considering how much I whine about it not working any more, it finally starting to improve has totally snuck up on me. I was reading a book about KV55 (?? - the tomb Kent Weeks is working on that's reckoned to have been built for Rameses' sons) and suddenly realised I was totally absorbed in something, and able to think about it. I was in bed at the time - Heff was reading Spike next to me; I think he thought I was off on one again, as I started rambling incoherently about being able to concentrate, and actually understanding things! It's a big step towards regaining myself; it's so huge a part of my self-identity; and I missed it like Hell. Not totally there yet; but it's a good start.  So, despite the feeling of dread lack of progress on the getting-on-with-stuff front, I am improving. I still can't get the noodle round this dynamic where I'm blissfully happy and positive, but totally miserable and suicidal at the same time. My mood can crash so fast, and for no apparent reason; it scares the bejesus out of me.  George has just turned up. He looks a little surprised to see me sitting here at this hour. Actually, he looks kinda disappointed: it's HIS job to come and trample over us until we wake up. He does so love it when Heff swears at him first thing in the morning; especially as he knows that, eventually, Heffy will rise from the pit, stagger downstairs in a neighbour-scaring state of undress, slop food into his dish - and NOT ram a pill down his throat. He is a devious little bastard, that one. He might be old, mad and stinky; but he's not stupid. At least he's not leaking pus all over the place anymore - and we're back to three pills a day. Though I think the antibiotics must lessen the effect of the neomercazole: he's started licking the bedcovers again. o joy.  In other news, the lovely Lisa sent me some pics of her week away being abused and tortured. OMIGOD, but she's mad. Or brave. Or something. I'm kinda curious, jealous, admiring, turned on and squicked out all at the same time... I'm really enjoying chatting with her: she's so totally cool; and I think we're on a similar wavelength. Just wish I had more time at the moment to get to know her better. Rare that I get on so well with women. Plus, she's sending me purple lights: how could one NOT adore someone who's prepared to do that?    If she hasn't got any, I am determined to see Lisa in New Rocks now. Eve tells me that there're only two shops in the States that sell em: whenever she goes to stay with her Dad in Florida, people stare!! They're bloody heavy; but I bet that, even if you CAN buy them in NO, they'd still be cheaper over here - including the postage on 'em. I am dedicated to persuading everyone (cool enough) to get a pair: they're soooo comfortable; and, of course, very useful for kicking the shit out of anyone that hassles or annoys one in the street.   Not that this is why I wear mine all the time, though... >:-D   Still no word from Eve since she lost her phone. Having got our wee plan all formulated, and the kinks ironed out (as it were), the daft bint disappears! I reckon she must be busy with College starting again. Having said that, I've not exactly been out a lot recently. We were intending to pop round and see her; but I've lost her address out of my phone. Grrrrr....bloody thing. The one I bought is on the fritz, so I mailed the guy demanding a refund. He mailed me back saying 'no probs.'; but I'm still not holding me breath. At least, now I have some money, I might be able to buy one new - if I can find a 3310/30: they seem to have become practically obsolete!!  Wow, what a huge pile of rambly shite I've written!! Early mornings evidently aren't a good time to do this: brane still sleepy and stream-of-consciousness takes over!  Guess I'd better go and open the mail: I bin putting it off coz I'm in quite a good mood - despite the lack of sleep - and there's a letter in there from the Benefits people. P'raps I will just open the book (1889 edition of George Eliot) and save the rest till Heff wakes up.   Misery loves company, and all that!!

      Ahhhhh....  So much for the great wheeze about not whining in here...hahahaha!!  I guess I should explain about the whole 'mad' thing: I get these moodswings.   Sometimes I'm pretty up and happy. These days, since Heff moved in,  I'm pretty fucking happy most of the time.   But when I get stressed, the whole brane turns to mush. The slightest, inconsequential, little thing will set me off; and I descend, in this lethal spiral, to a state where there seems no point to anything, and everything seems to be for shit.   The oddest thing - and the hardest to cope with - about this is that I don't realise it's happening until  after it's gone .  One reason for starting the whole blog thing was that, when I was really, REALLY ill, I could see the ups and downs from looking back at what I'd written. It gave me a sense of progress; and helped me to begin to understand what was happening to me so I had some way of starting to fight it.  I'm MUCH better now; so I thought the new blog would all be nice and lucid and sane.  'Cept, of course, that I'm not.   Happiness makes you happy; but it doesn't make you   well  .  Ho hum.  Still.   Heff read all the resentful bitchy shit I wrote and we sorted stuff out - so it wasn't entirely wasted. He's so adorable: I woke up to find him bouncing round in a whirlwind of productivity, sorting out the house, my meds, the washing, the cat and my breakfast. I got breakfast in bed!! How spoilt is that?!!  But he says he's happy - and he understands the whole illness thing to the point that he can sort out the real issues from all the paranoid mad bollox. I love that he can do this: takes so much pressure off; and stops the illness making the relationship deteriorate in parallell. Also allows me to relax and concentrate on  controlling  it - rather than worrying about its possible effects.   It's just that, when I don't know what he's thinking, and I'm stressed and in a state of brane-melt, paranoia takes over; but I know he knows I can't help it when it all gets away from me.    How he's figured this out, when so many older, more experienced, and supposedly wiser, people can't see it is amazing; but he can combine instinct and intellect to figure stuff out; and has the discipline and compassion not to take it personally.  Talked a LOT today: much progress. Not that I feel we have any real problems between us: we pretty much agree on what we want, where we're going and how we feel. It's amazingly solid and productive for such a new relationship. We both feel like we're home; but there's also so much scope for growth and exploration.  Also, lots of nice beatings happened today; and much intense pain; so me feel much calmer. Bastard's got me completely addicted now. Wait till it's HIS turn!  The olds showed up to use the PC this morning - as theirs is fuxxored still. They're off to France again next week: a bit of R & R and preparing (bracing) themselves for the onslaught. Typical that both Dad's and Gran's operations are in January. But they seem really happy - and, as they both  adore  Heff (unheard of instant approval upon first meeting. Frankly   astonishing   ; particularly in the light of the extreme negative reaction upon hearing about him - esp. his age. *sigh*), they seem to trust that I'm happy, cared for and will be okay in the end. I'm glad that they're less worried. They're going to need all their strength for Gran, I think.  So we went round to Sarah's this evening which was great. Me and her drank this purple stuff and gossiped while Heff was fixing her laptop. She'd made bakewell tart, too. It was really great being there: friendly, warm and relaxed. I do love her so. I missed not spending time with her; but I'm glad she didn't get forcibly dragged into the middle of all the shit. She's changed her opinion about a lot of stuff, though. She's smart enough to see through the manipulative publicity to what's REALLY going on: another reason I love her and value her opinion so much.  God, I am SO lucky. Look at the gorgeous people I have in my life who care about me; and let me care about them and be a part of their lives.   How in the hell do I ever get to think life's a poinless exercise in misery and endurance?  It's a tribute to the power of the bloody illness that, in a few days' time, I'll probably be wandering hopelessly around the docks again in the dark, fighting the urge to jump in.  What do you do when the huge, solid, chunks of sanity, happiness, rationality and hope can be completely overwhelmed in a second by insubstantial slivers of mindless despair?  Keep taking the meds, I guess, and hope for the best.  And get Heff to chain me to the bed every night so I can't wander off?   Well, it's a thought....  >:- P

      Okay, so, it was....a weekend...  House stuff seems to be progressing; but not up to getting excited about it yet.  Benefits a disaster: the Council are a bunch of useless assholes; and the Department of Wank and Prevarication are right behind them in the queue for A Good Slapping (Long Overdue).  I shall appeal the council's decision that I haven't been  that  ill for the last six months...just as soon as I have a day where I make it out of bed for long enough; with a brane that can string two thoughts together - at least one of them vaguely coherent.  Had a great time on Friday, though. Got to spend time with a small, loony Scot - though STILL haven't managed a sane, sober convo with her yet. Hopefully soon, tho. Great woman - strong, capable, funny; often surrounded by people intent on sucking her dry, though, I suspect. Hmmmm.  Funny how, if you're strong, people assume there's no limit to it and that you don't sometimes need a little support yourself, innit?  Also, the Evie thing. She likes Heff. She supposedly loves me. I love her. We always seem to be pissed beyond all reason whenever we get to spend any time together. Will have to work on this one and see what happens. She's utterly gorgeous; but I can't decide whether she's in too fragile a state to persue this.   Come to that, I was a bit startled to realise that I have feelings for her that run deeper than the odd shag now and then. Also, given recent events, not sure about coping with the boi's involvement in it. Getting accurate...well,  any ....information out of him re. his thoughts, feelings and intentions is slightly harder than finding water in the Sahara. I have no clue, currently, where his head is on this project; or what other feelings/opinions he may have to share about it.  Wonder if I'm in too fragile a state to persue this?    Ho Hum.   Spent all today in bed: woke up at 4 am to find boi slumbering peacefully next to me. Whole house freezing, all lights on, kitchen trashed, all doors open. Had to get up to pill and feed cat. Muttered darkly. Went back to sleep. Woke up at 8; couldn't face trashed house. Went back to sleep. Woke up at 12 - kicked boi out of bed. Read mail - council being bloody-minded; day seemed pointless: went back to sleep. Boi brought coffee. Read book while boi played games. Went back to sleep. Boi had shower. Got extensively and thoroughly shagged by boi. Spaced. Went back to sleep. Boi brought food. et. Boi fucked off to play game "for 10 minutes". Read book for an hour. Got bored waiting for boi - went back to sleep. Boi woke me up at 10 (pm). Phoned a couple of people. Et pizza. Boi fucked off to play game. Boi came back and fucked me. Boi went to sleep. Abandoned pointless attempt to initiate anything resembling a conversation at this point. Got up. At 3 am. w000t. Who sez I don't get up early?   That was my day. Well, yesterday, now, really.  I expect today is going to be remarkably similar...  Only with even less input from the boi - now that I am finally, obviously, pissed off at his recent antics. It's quite amazing that we can inhabit the same dwelling without seeing each other for more than a couple of hours, or having anything even resembling a conversation, for three whole days. (Tho I think the conversation part is longer: seems you get  either  to talk  OR   to fuck - not both).  Cat just turned up to wipe stinky pus all over me.    I foresee more pus, drool and witless growling in my near future.  I expect the cat's not going to be much fun to be around, either.  I love my life.  No, really....

      God, what a day.  Spent most of it trying to be friendly for the benefit of our 'guests' while cleaning up all the mess.  Heff in such a godawful state - he spent the day crashed out under the quilt on a pile of cushions in the living room. Too sick to make it to Sainsbury's: had to go on my own. Had HUGE panic attack halfway through the shopping: had to abandon trolley and hide in loo in Mall for 20 mins - then start again. When I got home (with flowers and food for his delicate stomach) Heff managed to emerge for just long enough to grunt at me blearily, carry some of the bags into the kitchen, and refuse to eat anything; before subsiding into unconsciousness again.   WAY too trashed to come to Noel's: I went on my own - after spending two hours wandering around in the dark wondering what the point of it all is.  Noel's party was...a bit of a blur, really. I remember talking to Hayley and the Jelly-baby fight; but that's about it. Only stayed for two hours.  Heff a bit better when I got home - was really sweet to me; but still falls asleep if I try to have a serious talk with him about stuff.  I kinda miss him, yanno?  Still, tomorrow should be a laff. Going to buy lots of junky presents for Noel to cheer him up a bit. Then taking cake round and watching him open them all!   Teeheehee!!

      Well, what an interesting and unusual night that turned out to be!  Heffy is still suffering...his head hurts so much he's spacing and alternately giggling like a fucker and looking pale and interesting. However, he won't go back to bed coz Eve is still sitting here, in my nightshirt, talking to me. Heather is still crashed out having spent most of the night getting stoned.  It's 2.30; it's Noel's party tonight; I have to go into town - which means I have to get Heff into some fit state so he can come with me.  Have to think about this....funny how stuff turns out, innit?

      Well, new blog: attempt to get away from the habit of using my blog as a place to whine and vent unconstructively.  Also, vow not to slag people off, or talk about graphically sexually explicit stuff (all the time) in here, so it can be a public blog, read by people I actually  know .   (Should their lives be dull enough that they'd wanna read it.)  Anyway.  Where are we at the moment?  Living in unadulterated bliss with the beloved Heff: lots of pain, fun, slamfucking and sweeties. On the relationship front, it gets better every day. This is highly suspicious: means there will be shit arriving somewhere else to compensate.  House is interesting: waiting to see if the Irish Teacher/Soldier Cousin will be buying the one we live in. If it pans out, we will be able to make lots of mess and noise with the excuse of renovation as an exculpatory figleaf. (to explain to the neighbours all the screaming, wailing and power-tool noises they might hear.) Plus ITSC might even end up with a nicely renovated investment. First thing to go will be the 'hedgehog having a poo' (I kid you not) china doorplate on the bathroom door; swiftly followed by all the carpets and the woodchip paper.  *Bracing self for lots of plastering*  George (elderly cat) has an abscess, so looks like he's got a mump at the moment. It makes me kinda squicky to see his face all swollen up on one side; but Heff keeps taking the piss: "haha! You've got a lop-sided face!".   George isn't impressed.   Still, despite the fact I hurt him so much last night that he hissed and scratched me trying to get away, (when I was squeezing out all the pus from the abscess. Love having cats. SO much fun); he doesn't seem all that bothered, generally. He's still eating us out of house and home; and the lump on his head hasn't noticeably stopped him from huffing rotting-meat-breath on us, as he stamps all over our heads, to wake us up in the morning so he can get fed.  And now I have to give him FIVE pills a day.  I should hire out myself as a cat-piller: I'd make a fortune.  In other news, I'm still mad, agorophobic (which I STILL can't spell), horny, nasty, panicky and cynical; and still medicated. Think I'm getting a bit better, tho: have resigned self to having to heal my short-circuiting  brane myself.  Still, if Sarah and I start this doll-business, and it makes any money, it will give me something really positive to focus on for the future.  IF we don't end up fighting like cats and dogs over it, that is.  Today has been good: bit of low-grade torture and stuff; Heff took George to the vet on his own for the first time - and survived; mad olds visited; and Heff cooking dinner (my signature dish) under my direction. We're waiting for Eve to turn up as, having consistently broken every date I've made with her since she came home, I feel I owe her at least dinner and a night in the pub.   And yes, I do have designs on her: but only if she's really up for it. Much as I'd like to see what it's like to shag her when we're both at least a bit more sober than the last time, I'd still be happy to settle for her as a mate. She's cool. She's smart and bought me nny for my birfday. Haven't enough mates like this - let alone horny ones with nice tits...  *stops before brane descends into gutter* (again).  Heather's coming to stay for Noel's party, so we're off down the pub later. Hope Dave and Melissa come - they're having problems at the moment; which is a great shame as they'd be perfect for each other if they could both just get past their insecurities and communicate. I kinda miss Dave; he used to be a fun mate.   Really looking forward to seeing Heather again - she's just my kinda loon. And I think having some company will do Noel good. I'm worried about him - well, more exasperated, really. But he's not my responsibility any more: I just want him to be happy.  But I can't run his life for him.  I'm rambling. Better toddle off and check dinner's progressing suitably and have a bath before Eve gets here.  Heh, heh, heh!!!

       ...Ha  HA !!   Feeling 100000% better today (yes, I know you can't have that much 'per   cent'  ; but I get 'artistic licence' - ok?).   Me and Him had a long chat and we're  both  feeling better, actually. Apart from the obvious extreme exhaustion stuff of course - tho even that's improving: slowly.  You know, it's odd how you can live in the same house, be together virtually 24/7, sleep in the same bed - and still manage not to have a proper conversation for nearly a month. It's all the stress: it's been HELL; and we've both had to find our separate ways to cope with it.  Me, I just go nuts (nice and easy: I don't have to DO anything - just get swept away in a reflexive tide of insanity); Heff withdraws into his shell, spends lots of time on the PC, gaming, and gets all control-freaky as his failsafe persona in times of deep frustration and inactivity.  *sigh*  Still: we now formally recognise the effects each of these coping strategies has on the other; so I guess it was a good lesson to learn early on.  Apart from that, everything's getting to look suspiciously peachy again.  Worry...?  Perhaps there is a slight chance that Fate has got bored with watching us writhe and has gone off to torture some other unfortunate bastard.   Or the job-share Guardian angels are both back from their holidays and making an effort, for once, to compensate for all the shit they so spectacularly failed to catch over the last few months.  *thinks*  *shakes head*  Nah...I doubt it.   'Nuther dumper-truckload is probably just over the horizon...  Yeah, I know I am a pessimistic bastard with a somewhat gloomy outlook where Fate and fortune is concerned: but you can hardly blame me, can you? It's an attitude developed in response to years of experience: to be positive and cheerful would be a highly masochistic and irrational reaction - in light of what my life has put me through over the last...oooh...34 years or so? So - I am a boyscout at heart: I believe in being prepared.  Besides, at least if you are a pessimist you can only ever be  pleasantly  surprised.  In other news, we finally got our housing benefit through.   *does happi little dance*  Apparently, despite us telling them that we have to pay our rent on the 18th of every month, they arbitrarily decided that, tough, we will have to pay it on the 1st.   And - you guessed it - this  didn't  mean them putting the money into my bank account  early ...  Thank God for Gran: she's lent me the money to pay the rent for the last two weeks.  Anyway, to celebrate actually knowing where the rent for Saturday is coming from, we had a bit of an eBay-Whore-fest. Heff got a tail-coat and a fishnet vest to wear under it; we bought some metal vases (for the gothic dining-room) as they were a steal at 99p; and we are currently watching this huge dragon head and wings thingy that you hang on the wall. It's a shitload of dosh and it comes from Germany; but it would look utterly fantabulous above the stairs. Yanno, so people can see it from the door, thereby having No Excuse When They Realise The Truth.  But the best bit is that I found a pair of brand new Demonia Pleaser boots: 6" platforms; laces up the front; 5 buckles up the side; with an inside zip. Currently, they're at £15 with 7 hours to go; and I'm winning.  *bounces maniacally*  The drawback is that they're in New York - but Hell, even if the shipping costs another £20, that is STILL a helluva bargain for boots that wouldn't get you much change out of £200 in London (IF you could find somewhere that sells 'em).    And I SO need a new pair of boots: I've only got 2 pairs of platforms, a pair of spike-heeled buckle boots, me lace-up school boots, me short Victorian lace-ups, me Rocks, me Docs and me slave boots that I can wear out. And Sarah's borrowing me slave boots.   As you can see, they're virtually a necessity!  So I'm glued to eBay to see if I win 'em or not. This is prob'ly a bad idea: I want them SOOOOOO much - and I have been known to get just the  teensiest  bit carried away on eBay.  I will be strong, though.  Oh yes. Strong and...determined. I shall amaze and inspire with my self-control and forbearance. I shall be sensibleness incarnate and thrift personified. I shall resist temptation and stick firmly to my limit. I shall rise above all thoughts of conspicuous consumtion, vanity and avarice; astonishing everyone with my fortitude and sheer, iron-clad, teflon-coated will power.  Oh yes.  Just as long as no one tries to outbid me.  Besides, I've put on a bid of up to $65, so there's a long way to go if anyone attempts to try and steal them away from me at the last minute.  *mutters*   MY   boots!!  While I've been locked out in cyber space, Heff has unpacked the box which had all the ornaments and candle-sticks in; put some pictures back up; and re-hung the curtains. So the house is starting to look a little less like an abandoned Kensal Rise squat formerly occupied by tramps, crack-whores and a small herd of wilderbeeste.   Thank you, Heffy!   Awww, bless him - he's nest-building!  Tho, currently, he is eating pizza and fiddling with his boots - again: how many different things can you DO with one pair of New Rocks, a few feet of chain, a heap of D-rings and a couple of padlocks? Still....keeps him nice and occupied - and stationary - at the dining-table - where he can't make any mess (DON'T ask: let's just say that our views diverge on the strict definition of the word 'clean').  It's absolutely bloody freezing in here. We put the heating on a couple of hours ago; but we're both still blue like icicles. I couldn't figure out how the house was actually getting  colder ...'till I went upstairs and realised that a certain wazzock of my acquantence had left the bedroom door open. This is the bedroom where I'd opened all the windows wide to air it. Then carefully closed the door to keep -  a.  the cat from doing a deathleap onto the drive which would be both expensive and messi (and, given the beast's unusual mental state, highly likely);  b. ...er.. the bloody house warm...?  Duh!  But I'm not moaning, honest!!   I LURVEs him - he adorable and sexi and funni and smart and cute yummi Boi. And he's MINE!!!  Mmmmmmmmmm........Boiflesh.....arrrghllllrraaarrrgle...*droolz*  So, I hardly mind at all about all the towels ending up in drifts in 'his' room; or all the lights left on all the time so the house looks like Crystal Palace; or the piles of dirty washing he collects; or that he doesn't fold up and put away the clean washing when he takes it out of the tumble drier; or that I keep breaking my toes on the assorted collection of footwear he likes to abandon at random in the middle of the floor; or that the kitchen looks like an envornmental health officer's worst nightmare after he's made even a sandwich in it; or that he squashes me out of bed every night; or that he thinks sweets are a nutritious alternative to vegetables; or that he spends hours making a shopping list and then usually manages to leave it at home....  ...uh....so, he's not exactly house broken yet.   The main trouble is that he's got too used to some subbie female or another looking after him and cleaning up behind him all the time. He's having a bit of a shock with me, I think: he isn't really used to it yet. The look on his face when he loses his temper and I shout back and won't do as I'm told....*giggles*  But I  am  laughing about this stuff, honest. In a deeply warped and twisted kindofa way, I find it almost endearing. It's...well....Heff; and I just adore having him around.   The strangest thing is that all this stuff would have driven me NUTS with anyone else. And while I can't claim to be utterly thrilled by the squalor; and I take the piss quite a bit; it really doesn't bother me all that much.   Uh oh...  It's the mushy, fluffy, dribbly stuff again, isn't it?   It's robbing me of my legendary intolerance and violently abusive control-freakery - where Heff's concerned, at least. Generally, I really don't feel the overwhelming need to whip him into shape to render him bearable to live with (like most of the others).  Oh bugger....  Never mind - I'm sure I'll come up with other ways of amusing myself with him, instead!  *big cheesy grin*  I am now going - finally - to go and put the Henna on my hair.   Space Alien a go-go.  Lock up your pets and make sure to blindfold all small children, elderly relatives, and those of a nervous disposition.  But it HAS to be done.  I looked at myself in the mirror today and was horrified at how much of my hair is grey! It's unusual that I don't henna my hair every month or two, so I haven't actually seen my  real  hair for about 20 years. However, due to all the  Sturm und Drang  round here lately, I haven't died the barnet for, like four months; and, having looked in the mirror while I was actually awake and paying attention for once, I notice that I look like someone's Granny!!  So I won't be leaving the dieing of the hare for another four months, again, in a hurry.   Besides, I just  Lurve   squodging all that gunky, smelly, messi, muddy, oogi shite all over my head once a month. Plus, for a fortnight afterwards, I get to bathe in water that looks just like wee - after I've dunked my head in it. And then there's the three-days'-worth of orange scalp, of course - let's not forget that!!  It's all worth it, tho. Especially since I now know that I am no longer able to stretch the limits of even MY credulity to believe that, in my natural state, I am a red-head, any longer.  No, not even 'chestnut' or 'auburn'.  Now it's kinda pale-shite-brown, heavily seasoned with talc white and tombstone grey.  *gloom*  Tho, of course, in my very soul, I will be a red-head forever.   *strikes dramatic pose*  (Even if the actual hair has to be 'helped', now and again, to maintain the outward appearance - so people  know .)  *sigh*  I'm so vain...  For a stunted, plain, fat, scrofulous, middle-aged, psycho-bitch-pervert from HELL with greying hair, that is...

        ...Tuesday...    [*WARNING* I am having an 'off' day.]  I hate Tuesdays.  Traditionally, Tuesdays are for nursing a hangover and resting a bad case of 'headbanger's neck'. They're for staying in bed, watching daytime telly, sleeping, drinking sugary fizzy shite and cautiously conditioning your delicate system to take your habitual levels of nicotine, caffeine and sustenance, until the ibroprofen kicks in, you're re-hydrated, caught up on sleep and feel well enough to get up.   Tuesdays are when you get peacefully to slob around the house; have a nice, long, hot bath at around lunchtime; clean and polish the rubber/leather/PVC you wore last night; force yourself to eat some toast or yoghurt at around 3pm; before cleaning up the kitchen - which is still littered with the remains of what you et when you came in at 4 this morning, staggering, happy, smeared, sweaty and euphoric.  They're for phoning your mates, arranging to meet up later in the week, daydreaming, intriguing, gossiping, speculating and conducting amusing post-mortems of the previous evening's debauch.   That's what Tuesdays are  supposed  to be for.  They're not supposed to consist of getting out of bed, alone, at 11.00 - because you woke up at 7.30 but couldn't bear to face the chaos, dirt, mess and disorder of your house, specifically, and your life in general; so you went back to sleep.  You're not sposed to wake up with a headache because you slept too long; and with no knowledge of having had a great time the previous evening; and with no sense of the peace and renewal, and massive release of tension, that comes from bouncing around maniacally, that ameliorates the effects of the worst headaches.  When you make it downstairs on a Tuesday, you're not supposed to feel completely, hopelessly overwhelmed at the huge amount of stuff you have to do; and this is not supposed to cause you listlessly to make your coffee and drift towards the PC - because you are at a loss where to start to wade through all the shit; and suddenly have niether the energy nor the inclination to deal with any of it.  You're not s'posed to spend Tuesdays vegetating pointlessly until the alleged love of your life appears, just in time to exchange a few non-committal syllables with you - the first for 18 hours - before dashing out of the house coz he's slept too long and is running late. Nor are you s'posed to sit, wallowing in self-pitying misery and guilt and self-loathing, trying not to think about what you  should  be doing, and fighting the strong desire to return to bed; because you can't even work up the enthusiasm even to have a bath.  Tuesdays are supposed  to be for instilling a sense of exhuberance and energy in your existence, so that the rest of the week before you seems filled with possibility, interest and progress. They are not supposed to be a windy precipice, from which you percieve the rest of the week stretching into dark infinity, a landscape filled with mountains, pits and swamps, the negotiation of which you feel you have neither the energy nor the will to achieve.  They're  supposed  to be the day where the objective is to crawl OUT of bed, grab the world by the throat and shake it till the good stuff starts to fall out; not the day where your primary desire is to crawl back  into  bed, to escape reality - indefinitiely, if at all possible.   It's the day you're supposed to be most aware of the keenness and joy of being alive.  Not the day where you wish it would all cease to be.  I can't wait till Kartouch re-opens and I can get back to feeling happily like shit on a Tuesday.  Well, it's a more realistic desire than wishing that my head would sort itself out, my medication would kick in and actually make a positive difference, the house would be clean and organised - and stay that way, the money would all get sorted, everyone who can't be supportive would just leave me alone, and that all the other pointless, useless, drainingly exhausting shite would just disappear from my life.  And to have just   one   day in the week where the initial feeling upon opening my eyes isn't howling pointlessness isn't too much to ask for, is it?

        ..I bin DYING to do this for over a year now...     ...so the Heff and I are baptising our new electric screwdriver by taking off the indescribably horrible ceramic door plate on the bathroom door.  It's supposed to be cute, I think: but it melts my brane.   Anthropomorphism a go-go: fluffy wikkle animals with socks and trousers on.  It's got a hedgehog on it.  Taking a dump.  Need I say more?  Hefflet's just feeded me roast chicken dinna: me very full.  So now I am going upstairs and we're gonna drink wine in bed till our dinna's gone down enough for one of us to lift the screwdriver.  Still got boxes everywhere: but the hall carpet's coming up tomorrow.  Life is looking up.    Pleeeeease   Fate?  Just for a  little  while...?

      OMIGOD!!!  I just blew Heff.  He's in a state of blissed-out delerium - he's gone to be somewhere dark and calm to recover (the sofa with all the lights off).  I think he's happy - certainly surprised (we just got back from the pub and he'd just finished ordering pizza as we didn't get round to having anything to eat today)  Then again, it's the least I can do.  I bin mad for the whole of the week and he's had to cope. He has no idea what's going on: just that his beloved has turned into a vegetative psycho-bitch; and, when she's not doing that, she's huddled incommuniocado under the duvet. He has no-one to talk to about this; no one to offer him support or advice; no-one even to hug him and tell him it will be okay. He doesn't even have anyone he can go down the pub with, to drink beer, yak about shite, and forget about it for a while. He just has to suck it up, cope, and get on with it - alone.  So to say he's been stressed is a bit of an understatement.  But he's soldiered on: in the hope that the woman he loves will re-emerge; trusting that, under all the weirdness and madness and silence, the person he knows is still there.  He copes with his fear on his own - and he IS scared. Hell, I'M scared shitless, and it's actually  happening  to me, so I don't know a damn thing about it: I can't remember this week at all. He's been on his own, doing the best he can, trying to keep our joint world, all we've built, all we've discovered, all we want for the future, and all we mean to each other, from totally flying apart; while I've been off, somewhere, with the fairies.  So, unsurprisingly, tonight, all the fear and stress and anxiety and exhaustion came to a head and he lost it. Of course, I don't know why he's so angry - I haven't been here, right? I don't remember what I've put him through;I don't remember the talks we had where he bared his soul to me; I don't know what he's done and how miserable he's been; and I can't see the relief - 'cause he can see the light at the end of a very long, very dark tunnel he's been trudging through - because he can finally hold a lucid conversation with me.  So he loses it; and I react.  And what do I do?  I do the one thing that he is most terrified about; the fear that underpins his every waking moment, that immobilises him, that makes it almost impossible for him to open up to me, just in case I freak.  I tell him to leave.  And I mean it.  I mean it for the following hour of sobbing and gut wrenching, excruciating misery; I mean it all through the post-mortem about why this can't work and why I can't trust him, and what he's done wrong, and why he needs to get away from me and have a life. I mean it right up until he finds the last few shreds of hope and confidence and courage to tell me what I have put him through - all the stuff I don't know about, cause I can't remember - to let me see all his fears and vulnerability, to hold out all the tenderest, most secret and sensitive parts of himself and ask me not to do this.  And, when I finally realise, he even forgives me.   In a second.   He doesn't hesitate to put aside all the shit and stress and horror and fear and isolation and misery and insecurity that has been his life with me since he got here.  He picks me up, he dries my tears, he hugs me and tells me he loves me and that it will all be alright. He says he doesn't want to be anywhere else than where he is. He tells me I am the light of his life and that we fit together and that he never wants us to be apart.  Then he pulls himself together and takes me out for the evening, so that I can see my friends; and he buys me drinks, lights my cigarettes, and lets me talk to people. He sits beside me and smiles when I catch his eye, and puts his arms around me to let me know he's there, and kisses me and tells me he loves me when we are going to go home. Then he walks with me to the cab and tells the driver where to go, unlocks the door and orders me dinner.  I have this wonderful, indescribably patient and understanding, loving, forgiving, fierce and passionate man beside me, who understands and loves me with everything he has and everything he is -  so deeply that he doesn't even have to think for a second about loving me even after I put him through hell.  And I love him in return, so much. I feel unworthy - deeply humbled. What did I do to desereve this? How can I ever tell him how much he means to me or what he gives me, every day, just by being here? How can I ever repay him for what he gives me and what he is to me?  Words fail me.  And I'm not given to the mushy, gushing, shite, anyway.  So a surprise blow job is the least I can do, right?  For the man I love?

      Yet more....  Arrgh. Thing's gone back to the single little window. Heff's bin fiddlin'...  Ended up having a nice day. I made Heff squeeze out the water from the bread so I could make bread-pudding.  He'd never et bread-pudding before.  He wanted to eat it hot.  And put cream on it!  (He's SO unsophisticated!!)  (said she from the manky bit of Pleb End)  But I think he likes.  Reason I mention this is 'coz it's the first gratuitous and spontaneous bit of non-essential cooking I've done for months.  I think I am already missing all my pots, pans and culinary gee-gaws.  Do you know that, apart from a preserving pan, a pie-funnel, dariole moulds, 4 pestles and morters and a bamboo steamer, I also own a larding needle? That's a little device for making strips of streaky bacon go through the breasts of pheasants so they don't dry out in the oven. Seriously. I spent WEEKS looking for one: finally, it cost me 2.50 from Fortnums (I think).  How am I going to cope without my larding needle?  Then again, here I am all excited about bread-pudding....so p'raps I won't miss it quite as much as I fear.  Besides, I'll have my aloe vera plant to keep me company instead.  Oh, and there's Heff too, I guess....  *purrs*  Speaking of whom.....

        Hmmmmmm....     Interesting day.   Found exquisite little house yesterday: 3 storeys, up a dirt track, surrounded by trees - very quiet and lovely place five mins walk from town centre.  But it's tiny-weeny; and we're agonising over whether we could actually live in it, comfortably, for six months. Most of our stuff would have to languish in Mum & Dad's garage.   But if we can get the washing machine in, and the fridge-freezer, we are telling ourselves we could cope. We both love the place so much - it's got real character, and I could see us being happy there; but part of me thinks we are INSANE even to consider it. But it's so lovely: and close to town: we'd save a fortune, simply on cabfare....and it's got  trees ....but the kitchen only has one double cupboard and a few shelves...then again, the top bedroom is MASSIVE, and it would be really cool to be up under the eves with that lovely view...only the bathroom is so weeny - and probably freezing in the winter - and two flights of narrow, precipitous stairs away from the bedroom...but it's newly decorated and has new central heating...  *sigh*  I HATE having to make decisions like this!  Still, even if it ends up as an utter disaster (watch this space *gloom*), it's only for six months.  We're going to have another look at it tomorrow - by accident - as I managed to leave my filofax inside yesterday, and the agent's meeting us there tomorrow so I can retrieve it.   Taking tape measure, this time...  So, anyway, we're waiting to see what the agent says; and (sensibly) looking at some others in the week.  *grinds teeth*  Plus, I have to extract the remains of my deposit from the useless bastards at Masons; and possibly retrieve the deposit on the other house from Seatons; as well as shouting at someone from the Council, as they now owe me £900 at least in back rent and I had to borrow £250 from Dad to give Paul the next 2 week's worth.  Tomorrow's looking fun, then.  In better news, ran into Eve in town yesterday - she had a cold but still managed to exude yumminess. Turns out she didn't have any of our numbers, either - they were all in her phone. We gave her our home no. and she called last night. We had a long chat, which was nice. She also invited us to her halloween party - Hell, we've got more invites this year than you can shake a stick at - but I'm really looking forward to dinner at Sarah's. Maybe we'll blow out Distinction and go round to Eve's later. Yanno, when everyone's either passed out or gone home - with a bottle of voddy - to offer 'comfort and support'. *grinz* In any case, we're going to see her tomorrow - fortuitously, she lives just round the corner from the little house, so we're going to have coffee. I might even make some brownies.  Ok, so I've been thinking about the whole 'third' thing again...   It seems like a really good idea; but I think we need to consider it, from every angle, for a while. A playmate would be nice; but I'd really like to explore something a little more serious, at some point. This is partly as a result of my feelings on 'openness' having seemingly done a 180 degree  volte face  since I met Heff: I can't bear the thought of him with another woman. That is,  going off   to be with another woman. I'm not sure how I'd feel if I was there too...I think it would be amazing; but there's always this little X-factor of paranoia in the back of my head.   However, I still have this deep-seated yearning for female flesh - though doing that on my own would feel odd, now, as well.  Ho hum.  Anyway, my inclination is definitely veering towards a third, as a way of everybody being happy. Heff says he doesn't have any desire for anyone else at the moment; but I know he wouldn't be averse to another girlie to boss around and play with!! We seem to be feeling the same about the idea of a third - inasmuch as we've actually discussed it; but, then again, neither of us has really had the time to sit down and think about how it would work in practice, or how it would change the dynamics of our relationship. There's a part of both of us, I think, that is reluctant to piss about with something that is so utterly blissful, at the moment.   Besides, there's all this other shit to get through first. But seeing Eve brought it all to the surface of my mind again.   If it ever happens, it would have to be the 'right' person for both of us; and someone who would get as much out of it as we would. It wouldn't work, I don't think, if they weren't an equal part of the relationship.  Plus, we'd have to have a house with a big bedroom; and buy a bigger bed: Heff got very hot and squashed, last time!  Oh well.....  I'd certainly like to see if Eve would be up for exploring a bit - even if just for the experience - yanno, just on an experimental basis: to have some fun, and see what happened after that.  Hmmmmmm.....  Anyway.  After Paul put an ad in the paper, we've had several people 'round to see the house - one of 'em is coming back for a second squint today. I reckon Paul will sell it; but whether he's gonna make as much on it as he would have done if our original deal had happened, I doubt. Still...  Part of me will not be that sorry about leaving here. For one thing, it's too bloody far away from everything.   With me in this state, even going into town becomes a major expedition. It would be nice if Heffy and I could just put on our coats and walk whenever we wanted to go anywhere.  *wist*  On the packing front, progress to date is zilch. I'm not too worried - looks like we'll have a bit more time than we thought, anyway. We've got all the boxes and stuff that I think we'll need; and I have done this SO many times now that I'm pretty sure it will only take a couple of days. Though I do need to sort out quite a few bits and pieces, separate the trash from the ebay-able stuff; plus working out what we will need, and what we will have to store, if we move into the glorious high-rise rabbit hutch in the wilderness. So, really, there's  not a lot of point in doing much until we know where we're going and when - or, at least, about the rabbit hutch.   On the whole, I'm feeling much calmer about stuff, today - fatalism is re-asserting itself. The last few days have been rough, though, and I've been very wobbly. Friday was probably the worst: I can't remember much. I was having to try and write the damn benefit appeal (coz I forgot about it completely, what with all the pissing about this week). It's hard enough to concentrate under normal circumstances; but I had to show people 'round the house, then Dad came and re-glazed the door - which was brilliant of him but very noisy and distracting, then Gran kept phoning every five minutes....   As we were up against a five o'clock deadline, I was a wee bit stressed and when I couldn't find all the info I needed (the paperwork in an advanced state of chaos due to complete lack of filing happening for three months), I flipped totally. By the time we couldn't get a cab to take us to the Council offices in time I was completely mental and raving: the evidence would seem to suggest that I ended up in the bathroom with a scalpel. Luckily, Heff banging on the door and yelling at me, minutes before he had to jump into the cab, pulled me out of whatever stupor I was in. He was in quite a state himself by the time he made it back from the Council - clutching the reciept like his life depended on it. I think he quite freaked the woman who finally let him in: apparently, she had to persuade him to let go of the envelope - even after she'd given him the bloody reciept - as he was almost babbling.  All in all, not the highest point in a week almost entirely composed of lows, I think. Plus, I have to remember to put a big plaster over the place every time my olds show up - or they'll freak. I think they've probably got enough to deal with, already.  The worst thing about this damn illness is its inherent unpredictability: my mood can change so fast; and when I'm off on one, I haven't a clue what the hell I'm doing. Things are not helped by the increase in my meds: they tend to make me more anxious for a while before it settles down and I feel any benefits.  The timing of all this is just spectacular: one of my GA's must have been on holiday and forgotten to leave a post-it note for the other...  Continuing the theme of everything happening at once, Gran is going up to London tomorrow for her meeting with her surgeon. We're all quietly terrified that he will decide she's too frail to survive the operation; or that her condition has deteriorated too far to be fixed. She seems to have improved quite a bit, lately, though: fingers crossed. Nothing we can do about it either way, I guess: except hang tight and wait and see, of course.  Yanno, I used to think that wading through all the shit, the endless fighting you have to do to make anything happen, was the worst bit; but I'm having it forcefully brought home to me that the absolute   pits   is sitting around waiting for stuff to happen. That point where you've done all you possibly can, and your future - and that of those you love - is wholly in the hands of other people, is just excruciating. Especially when you have scant trust or confidence in the abilities of those to whom you have entrusted your fate.  Hey ho.   I would develop a little more faith; but whenever I do, it always seems to sneak up behind me and bite me on the arse.  Not that we're downhearted or despairing, or anything: I refuse to let the bastards have that much influence.  So, on a more positive note (and quietly amusing, in my head at least) Heff is buying me a collar. After years of sneering and sniggering, I tried it the other day; and it really helps. Not only in terms of headspace, and getting into a more submissive frame of mind; but it also helps to define much more clearly the boundaries of the roles. When I'm not wearing the collar, I am just me; when Heff puts it on me, I am slut. I find this endlessly amusing: another example of my words tripping me up again. I still don't like the whole 'lifestyle' type thing; but, as a tool, I have had to backdown about the usefulness of a collar and admit that, in my more exclusively Dommely days, I wasn't really able to grasp the idea from the most useful and insightful perspective.  So I've spent all day (pretty much - in between people wandering round poking in cupboards and asking me questions about the heating) online looking at collars. And coats. I appear to have lost mine: so we need to buy one of us a new one. Who would have guessed that floor-length black coats for less than £100+ were so hard to find?  Ah. The final house-seeker has just left: so I am off to make the Boi something nice and hot and filling for breakfast: the least I can do is return the favour!!!  *cacklez*

      *panics*  I am clinging to the desire not to let the fuckwit-knuckle-dragging-mouth-breathing-asswipe-moronic-cretinous-subhuman-bollock-brained-jerk-wads have enough power over me to ruin my life.  Looking at another house today - with a different agent. This one comes recommended.   *tries hard not to look too sceptical*  Also planning the frozen prawn revenge.  It passes the time and stops my brane from shutting down entirely.  Life suxass.  (Mine, anyway)

        ...bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger....FUCK..      *sigh*  Why can't ANYTHING be straightforward?   Just for  once ?   I mean, yanno - just for the sheer  novelty value  of the thing, or summat?  And, while I'm pondering personally existential connundra, why the FUCK does everything have to happen all at once?  So, on Friday, we rang up all the letting agencies, so we could identify the ones that will take people in our particular circumstances. To each one who didn't just slam the phone down on us in disgust at the mere mention of the word 'benefit', we carefully explained the situation re. the technicality of me being on Disability Living Allowance and Heff being employed by the Govt. to look after me.   Having thus made sure they were wholly and totally aware of our situation, we started flogging around, looking at the houses to which they sent us.  Seatons, who Paul was selling the house through (BIG clue - in hindsight), looked like the best: we saw a couple of hovels; then this fantastic Edwardian 3-bed semi that would be PERFECT. It's huge, has a nice garden, a garage and everything we wanted. So, immediately we'd seen it, we rushed down to their office to get there before it closed, handed over a large wodge of cash (thanks Dad) and started filling in all the forms. Half an hour in, I happened to mention, in passing, something about the benefit.  There was a short silence.   The trace of a confused frown appeared on the girl's face; swiftly followed by "...oh....um...?"  That was Tuesday.  It's now Thursday morning.  We spent a pretty miserable day yesterday waiting for the agent to get in touch with the Landlady. To encourage Seaton's to pull their finger out, we went down to their office in the morning - to find that they had put some feeble bimbo in charge of the thing. It then transpired that she  had  rung the owner first thing (good); but had explained the situation to the woman while, unfortunately, not being in posession of all the facts (very, very bad indeed).   To make it even more entertaining, the house we want, it turns out, is being managed not through Seatons (who are just showing people around the place) but through Masons - our current landlord's agents. While this is good news from the point of view that they know us to be sane, reliable and house-broken tenants, it is a  very bad   sign from the perspective that they are notorious for being  spectacularly  crap; and that it represents yet another node in the chain of communication; thus providing yet another oppourtunity to garble, misunderstand, fuck up and, generally, wholly and totally to bollox the whole process.  So.  Today we are, with a sense of impending doom in our hearts, waiting for the landlady to make a decision; then for her to get back to Masons; then for Masons to get back to Seaton's; then for the ditz at Seatons to work up enough of a sense of urgency to let US know what the fuck's going on.  Meanwhile, we don't know whether to start looking at houses again; sit tight and wait to see what happens in the end, or just have done with the whole thing, get a couple of Kalashnikovs, and go out on a murderous spree of slaughter (directed exclusively at estate agents) in order that our accommodation, consequently, will be organised by Her Majesty's Prison System thereafter.  I am left wondering what was the point of endlessly checking, from the start, that the landlords/agents would be okay about our circumstances; and, having done that, why the cretins sent us to look at  any  houses without checking with the owners first; and why it is seemingly IMPOSSIBLE to speak to the same person twice - unless it is the airheaded female who wouldn't say boo to a goose and can't hold a thought in her head for more than 10 minutes. Finally, I am left to wonder why the hell they find it so  fucking  difficult to pick up the fucking phone for TWO MINUTES, every once in a while, just to let you know what's happening.  In fact, I am suffering from a wearyingly familiar sense of deja-vu, related to the (pretty widespread, I reckon) belief that, if you are having to deal with 'professionals' in  any  arena in this country, you should EXPECT them to fuck up.  You should KNOW that you have to explain everything to them at least four times, in words of less than one syllable.  You should also not be surprised when, even after you've done this, they will STILL get confused and tell the people who matter the wrong things.  You should be  prepared  for them to have no clue what you are talking about every time you call them back 'cause the person you spoke to originally is 'out of the office at the moment', 'in a meeting', 'with a client', or 'out to lunch'. (Though the latter is blatently evident from the first time you speak to them on the phone).  You should also anticipate that they will have no sense of urgency whatever about anything that you have a severely limited time to sort out.   In fact, you should predict, and be able to accept, that you will be releasing the whole of your fragile and complicated life into the hands of morons, who neither know nor care what they are doing; and over whom you have ABSOLUTELY  no  control  whatsoever .  Finally, you should make sure to be equipped with the patience of a saint (quite a good one) -  in order that, when you finally give in and phone them (for the third time), to find them listlessly vague and infuriatingly unconcerned about the  one  , simple - but  critically urgent   -point; the one that you begged them to clarify last time you spoke to them; and that they  promised  to phone you straight back with an answer to (6 hours ago); you won't drop the phone, pick up the nearest biro, and repeatedly stab yourself in the eye with it in a gibbering frenzy, simply to release yourself from the agonizing torture of having to deal with them any further.   I was so surprised, on Tuesday when we went to the Brewery Tap for lunch with the olds, to find a swift, efficient, polite and friendly service from the waitress, that I gave her a Â£5 tip. Unsurprisingly (on the proinciple that, in general, the public gets what they deserve) she was rather shocked and quite delighted.  Well, it's so bloody rare: the norm being "service with a snarl" - though minus anything even vaguely recognisable as service, of course.  *sigh*  So: we wait and see: trying not to panic, get depressed, be optimistic, pessimistic, furious, cynical, impatient, or even fatalistic, about the whole project.  We know we're not going to end up actually homeless, whatever happens. So we're counting our blessings about that and otherwise proceeding in a kind of insulated numbness.  Though it's much worse for Heff than for me: he hasn't done this before; and has no idea that this is perfectly normal. He's still suffering under the delusion that people will do their jobs in a willing and efficient manner because they WANT to help you as best they can, and have the satisfaction of being good at what they do for a living. (cue: hollow ironic laughter) So he gets really angry - he can't help it - despite me telling him that it's just a waste of energy we're gonna need for other things; and he wants to tell them all what a bunch of useles bastards they are - though I won't let him (since, however crap they are, we're still gonna need them to find us a house to live in after they've finished ballsing-up this one).   I think he's gonna be blogging a little more in the next few weeks: he needs a place to dump the fury and disbelief, or he's gunna start insulting random people in the street, just so they will retaliate and provide him with an excuse for beating them to a quivering, incoherent, bloody pulp.  (Me too - hence rant - sorry!)  Still - there is an upside to all this trauma: he got all Sadistic Domly-Dom on my ass last night - which certainly helped me; and I hope made him feel a bit better about things. He does seem a bit more resigned to things this morning, and he's smiling. He also keeps coming up and kissing me with this big grin on his face.  Currently (as neither of us can work up the enthusiasm to do any more packing till we know what's happening), he is arranging the obscene poetry fridge-magnet kit, that he bought me on Monday, according to whether the words are nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctives or possessive nouns.  Well, it's progress of sorts.   Mainly, though, it's a kind of a pennance for constructing the legend "I am going to penetrate your gorgeous bottom hard tonight" on the fridge door on Tuesday morniing - forgetting that my parents were coming to drive us about that day.   My Dad saw it.  (Apparently, Dad changed 'penetrate' to 'shower' (probably to save Ma from seeing it) - a fact I only discovered when Heff told me later what it had said originally.)   *cringes*  Just as well they love the little bugger as much as they do.  They might start to think he was some kind of degenerate pervert....  *snort*  In other news, I also had to go and see my shrink yesterday.  (Yeah, yesterday was a REAL fun-packed day.)  She seemed a little...how shall I put this?...furious?...that the Adult CMHT she referred me to three months ago had done absolutely bugger-all, beyond sending me a couple of leaflets offering me councelling (that I would have to pay for). As the Doc only referred me to the shrink in the first place because he decided councelling wouldn'r help me; and as I have now been off work for a year with this lunacy;and as, to date, excluding medication, the total amount of treatment I have recieved is 0; she's now referring me to MIND, in the hope that they will be able to offer some actually relevant and constructive treatment.   On the plus side, though: she did observe that I seem to be under quite high levels of stress, on a near-permanent basis. She then smiled, encouragingly, and went on to express the belief that, once I have moved and things have 'settled down' into a calmer routine, I will begin to make progress.  I smiled back -  in a somewhat wry and ironic fashion - at this: I have been saying the same thing to myself for at least the last 20 years. Though I'm still waiting for that mystical 'period of calm and routine' to materialise.  A little boredom would be blissful, right about now.  But she has increased my medication again.  w00t.  Meanwhile, I am resigning myself to the fact that, if I can't fix it myself, whatever is wrong with me will have to stay broken.  Good, innit?  I have just shown a couple of people (who are (were) thinking of buying it) 'round the house.  Paul (landlord) has now decided to sell it himself and has resorted to an ad in the local paper.   *rolls eyes*  Heff and I took some small, gleeful pleasure in the fact that the place is trashed, in utter chaos, and filthy; with boxes and junk strewn liberally throughout; with no curtains, ornaments or pictures and scant furniture; added to which, with a carpet covered in random heaps of feathers, forming a gory trail from the catflap to the bedroom (as George caught a bird this morning and we didn't have time to clear up the mess before the people arrived).   So they just wasted 15 minutes wandering around what looked to them like a complete hovel.  Teeheehee!!  Now I think I will go off and do some desultory sorting out of stuff.   Yanno, just on the offchance we actually DO get to move into a house of our own in the next month or so.  Failing that, it will make it nice and simple for all our possessions to fit neatly into my parents' garage....  *groan*  Anyone wanna swap two dim-witted, job-share guardian angels, who communicate via the 'post-it-note-left-on-the-fridge-door' system, for one half-decent guardian angel with more than two brane-cells to bang together?  Nah, go on - it's funny really.....  *sobs quietly*

        ARE  we downhearted.....??    Well, no, actually, we're not.  In fact, all things considered, we're still pretty bloody happy.  *taps screen to check if the thing's on the fritz*  Uh, not sure what's going on here...?  Okay, so chaos reigns; but everything seems to be progressing in a generally forwardly direction.   *blinks*  We've started looking at houses and I reckon at least one of them would be good - possibly two - not including the four we haven't seen (even from the outside) yet. The finances are getting sorted (that is, Dad will lend us what we need 'till we can pay him back); and packing up has begun.   I LOVE that bit best.  (um,   NOT  !!)  So far, we've done most of the study, most of the living-room and 10 boxes of books. We went and bought another 30 archive boxes today, so I'm hoping this will be enough to pack the rest of the books so we can take the shelves down and fill the holes.  I think I may have too many books - whaddya reckon?  So, all in all, I am hardly worried at all.   *laughs maniacally*  I know there's gunna be some massive, disasterous, HORRIFIC event at SOME point before we finish; but I am curiously relaxed about the whole thing.    P'raps I've gone so far through insanity now, that a combination of extreme hysteria and intense disbelief has made me care so little about what happens next that I look like I'm almost sane?   Either that, or my brane has finally shut down all non-essential sectors in a last-ditch attempt to protect itself from further damage.  *shrugs*   Honestly, though, it's just so nice to be  doing  something for a change. I hate hanging around, waiting in limbo helplessly till other people get their shit together - it feels so powerless.   And I'm not very good at powerless.  I'm a bit of a control freak, you see. (Just in case you hadn't already noticed)  Plus, moving house is an adventure; with the bonus, this time, that we're getting some guys to do the lugging boxes around bit (known by my Father, picturesquely, as "humping and dumping"); and if the place  DOES turn out to be a stinking, freezing, slimy, rat-pit, we won't have to stay in it indefinitely.  Plus, I have Heff. What more can I say? (without his head swelling so much that I have to use a crowbar to get him out of the house).  We're just not thinking about it too hard and getting the hell on with it.  So, seeing as how Heff and I now have SOOOO much to do, and so little time in which to do it, on Friday night we packed it in at 6 and went down the pub (as you do) with Lissa.   Just for once, I didn't drink and still had a really good time. Pin'ead (and his dubious mate Gareth) turned up; then Greg and Alice appeared; and we ended up wetting ourselves laughing - I think it was something to do with cheese...?  I can't remember. But it was funny, anyway. And Greg managed to make Heff snort beer out of his nose (Heff's nose that is - not Greg's) which was also amusing (in a rather damp and slightly snotti kindofa way) too.   Good to see Pin'ead - haven't seen him since the night he got stoned when Heather was here. Though he's so laid back, I'm beginning to think he's too laconic EVER to work up the energy to organise a life for himself. He's still in the same job he hates; and hasn't even started re-decorating his house - despite having my sander and steam-stripper for over a year.   Though he has said I can use his garden to bur...uh...store my 'victims' in if I run out of space elsewhere - as he managed to dig a bloody great hole in the middle of it before he got bored with 'gardening' and packed it in.  And he's such a nice middle-class boy, too: you'd never guess....  We also finally went round to see Lissa and Dave's new flat - which is amazing.  You'd never guess they've only been in it for a little over a month - and most of that bickering. Danni gave them a set of framed black and white pictures as a housewarming present, which are just gorgeous; and somewhat tasteful and surprising considering their source. It was prob'ly Toni! (I'm so nasti. Danni's a nice boy really.) (No he is!) (Honest!) Though a lot of the walls are filled with disconcerting Cradle posters and stuff, the effect, overall, is really cool. In the spirit of the thing (black, rubber) we bought Lissa some rubber doorstops today, as she was moaning that the doors keep swinging closed and hitting her on the arse. (I should be so lucky). The place needs candlsticks, tho: so that's the plot for the unmentionable-orgy-of-gratuitous-consumerism-holiday-at-the-end-of-December-that-I-loathe presents.  So, unhungover, but woken at dawn by the bleedin postie (again - we are SO gunna have to do something about that), Heffy and I had fun today looking at houses, having lunch out, doing a bit of desultory shopping; just generally bimbling about. It was even sunny!  *gasp*  Then (as if we don't spend enough time in there already) we spent a couple of hours in the Whore's with Sarah - as Dave had James today. Sarah is looking as luvverly as ever; and seems pretty settled and happy. She's really enjoying her Supported Housing course; and has her eye on a place she'd like to work which sounds like it will be right up her street - and isn't just a dead-end office job. It's SO nice to see her get her confidence back to the point where she's not prepared to 'settle' for something (or someone) that's not really what she wants. I love her; and I'm so proud of her! (AND she has a lovely bum!) (Cow.)  After that, there was the inevitable family council of war, and we ended up having the olds for dinner tonight (they were tough and stringy - ha ha) (sorry). Actually, they sprung for Indian - thanks to Gran (who bunged them some gratuitous readies coz she just found the 15 grand she'd 'lost', and was thus feeling generously disposed towards the world in general, and her relatives in particular).  Nice one, Gran.   Though she's driving me NUTZ, as she's got her panties severely wedged up her crack about the house falling through. I've had to explain to her three times already today that there's nothing she can do about it. I think she so wanted to see me settled; and this looked like the perfect way to give me at least a little breathing-space; but now it's fallen through, she somehow feels like it's her fault and she's let me down.  Daft old baggage that she is.  Then again, while she's so desperately concerned about my welfare, she still backpedalled FURIOUSLY when I asked her if she could lend me the fee for removals until the Council stumped up the Housing Benefit they owe us.   *sigh*   On the other hand, I really don't wanna borrow any money off her at all; because - as Heff said to Ma today - it's just not worth all the arse-ache involved.  Oooh and, apparently, she's changed her will -  again .  It's caused some not inconsiderable anxiety among certain dynastic factions, I hear; and Dee is worried that, if she keeps changing it every five minutes, it will be contested when she finally shuffles off. He thinks I should talk to her about it - but, really, I SO don't wanna get involved.  Like she'd listen to me, anyway. Even if she did, she'd have forgotten the whole conversation ten minutes later.  Besides, like I give a flying bat-shit what she does with her money.   I think the best thing she could do - for me, at least - is to leave it all to a cats' home, or something. I would be willing to pay quite a lot myself just to see the look on the faces of my Aunt and cousins when they eventually found out that they weren't getting a thing.   I'd probably laff so hard I'd end up inna pine box, too.  But what a way to go!  I hate families - they suckass. Well, bits of 'em, anyway.  In other news, got to meet John today: he's nothing like I expected!! But I really liked him - from the ten minutes of embarassed shuffling about making small-talk in my living-room that now constitutes our acquaintence. I just hope the three of them manage to get there and back again, in one piece, and without incurring any fines along the way; and that Paula's car also survives the experience.   However, the highlight of the week thus far is definitely the HUGE, furry, bendy-velvet-legged, glow-in-the-dark, purple spider I bought today. It's on elastic and has beady red eyes and really pointy feet. It's so.....um....very.....well... ME .   Plus, my eBay Nosferatu-inna-coffin arrived today - he really IS indescribably cool. I think that he's now my "if there was a fire and you could only save three things what would they be?" item no. 2. (No. 1 would be George; and no. 3 (obviously) would be Heff.)  *grinz evilly*  (No don't hit me - I'm luvverly really)  I am now going to spend the rest of the evening in bed with Heff, eating toffee popcorn and watching Duckula videos.  Bliss!!!

      *hollow and deeply ironic laughter*  Okay, I'm an unduly cynical pessimist, am I?  Yeah, right.  Though it's funny how life keeps bearing out my worst fears....  Well, the surveyors report came in yesterday: he valued the house at 6 grand under what the ITSC was gunna pay for it; and claimed that it needs £1500 worth of damp work doing.  Personally, I think this is bollox; but there's not a whole fucking lot any of us can do about it.  The landlord evidently reckons he can get more for it; so the deal's off, the house is back on the market, and Heff and I have 8 days to find a new place and move into it.  That's like, a week tomorrow.  I was half-expecting it: in the way you do, where you have it at the back of your head, but part of you thinks "nah, it will never happen". I would be hysterical; but I have neither the time or the energy to devote to the luxury of going mad.  Heff's being brilliant. Considering he's getting the baptism of fire introduction to the slime-pit that is my life; and considering he's never been through anything much like this before; he's handling it pretty well. Thank God for a sane, practical, reliable adult that I don't have to support or carry through crises. I KNOW that, were he not here, I would be being carted off to St. Clements about now, in one of those nice white jackets that does up down the back, under heavy sedation, and probably with criminal charges pending.  Oh well.   The ITSC still has all these cleared funds sitting in his bank account; and he's still keen to buy a house round here - as a good investment, as well as to supply his dropkick relative with a secure roof over her head. So, as soon as we've moved (into the first empty house big enough to store all the boxes in that we can find), we're gunna start looking for something for him to buy.  Of course, all this is complicated by the fact that he's off to Iraq inna couple of months; and made expensive by the fact that we'll have to buy ourselves out of our new 6 month tenancy agreement if we find summat to buy soonish; but hell - that's life, right?  Mine, anyway.  *gloom*  I am trying to console myself with the belief that, in the end, we'll end up with a nicer, bigger and more conveniently situated house to play with.  But, at the moment, we're living hour by hour; and trying very hard not to let panic and terror overwhelm us.  Plus, I'm not holding my breath: as we know, purple really isn't my colour....

      *bounce*  OMG, what a couple of days.   Although, come to think of it, it's actually less than 24 hours. Three mad women will do that to ya, I guess!  It's been great having the old bags here: like the Uber-Caberet-From HELL in yer living room. They're so much fun; but you can actually talk to the buggers, as well. More'n a single braincell between 'em, like, Yanno? I'm concerned that Nikki will collapse from exhaustion in the near future, tho: not only has she had no sleep to speak of in the last couple of days, she also seems to be nominally 'in charge' of the trio. In as much as one can detect any planning and organisation going on! (I say this in the nicest way possible, tho).  Given the vicissitudes to which they have all, in their various ways, been subject lately, it's good to see them still able to laugh. I admire their various forms of strength and fortitude: quite a humbling experience.  Plus, having them around DOES make me realise that I'm not  nearly  as mad as I tend to think I am...*cackles*  Heff has also learnt to suffer the endless piss-taking and gangings-up with grace and philosophical resignation. He's a peach, that one. Tho I think it's good for him, nonetheless!  So, in other news, it was nice to see Nick: his new house is LUVVERLY and I'm horribly jealous - especially of the three-tiered garden. Me wants!! The party was pretty great too - though Nick had to work quite hard to keep everyone happy coz I think when we showed up mob-handed, it scared the bejesus outta his 'nilla mates. So, depite compulsory ice-breaking tours of the subterranean portions of his demense, they stayed in the living room, while we had food-fights and obscene conversations (and Churchill dog impersonations) in the dining room. It was all a bit loopy. I learnt several new things: candy necklaces - immortalised by Nikki - can be used as pretty painful missiles; as can Kinder-egg innards; and marshmallows coming into abrupt contact with Noel's head make a satisfying dull 'thwuk!' noise. I also invented the 'Marshmallow Cluster Bomb': devastation more psychological than physical; but I laughed, anyway.  Yes, is was that kinda night. God help Nick's hoover: I doubt it will survive the day.  Though I think that the next time I see a Churchill ad, I will possibly find myself unable to stop screaming and gibbering. (Thanks, Heather....ma-honeh!)  This morning, after a night in a single bed with Heff (cosy), I didn't feel to bad. Though it quickly became apparent that I was in a minority of one on this.   Now they've gone to catch the three o'clock bus (tho Nikki left at some ungodly hour this morning), the house is eerily quiet and suddenly seems a lot bigger than it was yesterday.  Hope they come back soon!!  I spoke to Drake today - finally - which was really cool. He sounds much better than he did last time I spoke to him; so that's one less person to completely panic about.  He was child-minding: gawd, he's strict!! He'd probably be a good Dad - or make a nasti, cruel, Dom...  *falls about laffin*.   Sorry babes - but yanno what I mean.   *grinz*  Caused some entertainment amongst the assembled masses when they heard me tell him: "God, Drake, you're hard!".    Nothing like one-sided phone conversations to sort out whose brane is PERMANENTLY in the gutter....    Anyway, listening to all the lunacy in the background seemed to cheer him up a bit: I think he was bored, poor sod. Probab'ly suffering from PC withdrawal...? Another few hours and he'll be a slathering beast, desparate for a keyboard and a monitor to play with at any cost!!!   Yanno, p'raps I don't know him very well, but I have a hard time imagining Drake as anybody's 'slutboi'. He seems too smart, individualistic and bloody-minded to me.  Ho hum....  Also managed to get another hard drive for Sarah's PC. NOW all we need is a window's 98 disc as her OS isn't recoverable from her old disc. Everything takes so bloody LONG, and is so sodding COMPLICATED to organise....she really needs to get cracking on her coursework; and  Huwie (main target for scrounging software) is away with his GF this weekend. How bloody inconsiderate can you get: being away, having fun, when I need him to be here so he can lend me stuff??!!  Oh well, better go off and strip the beds before the HeffLord gets back and finds other stuff for me to do...  Yanno, like watching all those Duckula videos I just bought....  *teeheehee*

      ...uh oh....  *creeps in and looks around furtively*  *whispers*  I'm happy and things are going well.  Wow.  *checks to see that Fate didn't hear*  Shhhhhhhhhhhh....don't tell anyone....   Okay, so I am feeling VERY nervous.  Never had stuff go right, and been THIS happy, and have no impending skiploads of shit looming just over the horizon, before, EVER, in my WHOLE life.  Not quite sure what's going on....  Though I expect the punchline will be along shortly.  Had a longish chat with Heff and told him that I'm not gunna chuck him out on the street if he puts a foot wrong occasionally. Since then, there is actual  evidence  of happiness - other than the occasional vociferous verbal assertion.   He was doing this happy little conga-dance yesterday.   It was quite scary, actually.   Inna deeply cute and adorable kinda way.  I love him so much: can't believe how settled we are. Once he's a little more house-trained; learns to get out of his pit at a reasonable hour, and gets over this idea that, somehow, he's responsible for everything, he's gonna be just PERFECT!!  *dodges slap*  *grinz*  On other fronts (coz I'm sure you must be bored shitless about me being all mushy about the Boi all the time), the house thing should be sorted soon: The ITSC should have the surveyor's report today. It's really the last thing that can stuff it up...uh oh....did I really say that? *checks around for Fate again*.  Mind you, that could still pull all the wheels off....but, hopefully, by tonight we should know.   So it's off down the pub tonight - either to celebrate, or drown our sorrows.  Went out with Dave and Lissa last night and it was a really god laff. Heff seemed really relaxed; and Lissa and I are cautiously optimistic that Dave and Heffy are starting to talk. Heffy looked unbelievably gorgeous in his leathers and New-Rocks; Lissa looked lovely as ever (and groped me up - which was nice. Surprising; but still nice). Dave wore his deck shoes and his terrible 'little old man' jacket - just so I could nag him about them (he  says ).  I, like a pillock, wore me new platform boots - which, it turns out, are too skiddy to walk in on the floor in the club. So no headbanging for me. *sniff* Could do with a good bounce about - get rid of some of this energy I suddenly seem to be developing.  If you can 'develop' energy...?  Anyway.  Lissa's going home for three days in November - while Dave's on tour; and she's asked Heff and I to go with her!! Like I'm gunna turn down three days in Rome!! We get to stay with her Ma - not that there's going to be much sleeping going on, from what she's said. It's going to be a weekend of clubbing and sight-seeing: she's promised us post-club breakfast watching the sun come up over the Coliseum! HISTORY PIG HEADBANGER-PERVERT'S HEAVÂ£N!!  I also caught up with a couple of people I haven't seen for ages. Especially nice to see Jimmi - he's an adorable loon. Though I was really surprised to hear he's turning 23 - I thought he was about 18!!! I do also have severe doubts about that boy's sexual identity!! He may be having s0ome kinda crisis - either that, or he's VERY secure for a bloke!!  Also saw Rachel: OMG, she's horny. I don't normally like painfully skinny women: but there's something irresistible about Rach. I think it's her enthusiasm and naughtiness: she's just got this great big grin, yanno? Plus, there was the 'incident' in Kartouche last year when I discovered her subby streak. There is something about having watched a girlie let you force her to her knees by her hair in public that means things will never be the same again between you!! I'll get her eventually. Would have already - if the 'boys' hadn't decided to spoil it all by joining in. *mutters darkly*  Anyway, we're in the gutter again, I see...I have a horrible feeling people are starting to think I'm a total slut.   Or rather, see me for the total slut I am.  >;- P  Changing the subject ENTIRELY: Heather, Nikki and Ditey are coming to stay on Saturday. It's Nick's housewarming party - which should be a laugh! It will be great to have the girls here - I'm really looking forward to it. Still want Heather to stay for a bit, though: we actually had a 'proper' conversation on the phone last night!! oooooOOOOOooooo. Though, predictably, it degenerated into filth...with this mad bint cackling in the background!!  Yanno, that's the other great thing at the moment: suddenly, I know some really cool women! Not ever having been a big fan of women (beyond the obvious, that is), I have met very few I felt I wanted to spend time with. Suddenly, I'm in touch with some absolutely gorgeous, intelligent, funny, warm girlies. Never thought it was possible...though I guess it's not that big a co-incidence that all of them are rampant perverts, too!  Anyway, the Hefflet is gonna read to me for a bit: I LOVE that - when I'm not about to fall asleep, that is.  I am sickeningly in love: thinking of carrying a big bucket around with me wherever I go: yanno, for other people to use, like.  Fingers crossed that Fate has run out of shotgun pellets; and that the dump-truck the "Shit For U! Delivery Co." (TM) uses is in for a service...  *cue hollow, cynical laughter*  (I'm a pessimist: bite me.)  (Oh, go on: you KNOW you wanna....)

      blargh....   I'm sick - I think it might have been the pizza last night. No sleep, grumpy, oogi.   So.   Another good day, then!!   Trying to find a new fone to buy - why is it that sim free phones are SO much cheaper? if you add a pay-as-you go SIM, it doubles the price. I bought my SIM online for 99p. Makes no sense - but someone somewhere is making one Helluva profit.   Also gunna go on Wildcat inna bit - get some jewlry (nipple-shields - yay!!), some small tweezer-clamps so we can do Heff's ears, and some little needles. For shoving into me. How exciting.   After that, I am going to make the damn moussaka (Noel's coming tonight, instead - he was knackered yesterday) (there's a lot of it about) then crawl back into bed for a while and sleep. For real. I can't remember what sleep feels like...   In other news, the house is still nice and tidy. It's great. I suspect, tho, that that is only because I've pretty much been in bed since we sorted it.   Still haven't DONE anything: people are demanding money with menaces. It's crazy - especially as, for a change, I actually HAVE the money to pay them.   Arrrgh.   But I'm happy, really. Honest!

        The Soap Opera Continues...     Yeah, well...like, peace, quiet, calm and sanity is just around the corner, is it?    That's   gunna fucking happen...    Life's bin a bit more 'exciting' than we were expecting...  Things that have happened since Friday:     # Helloween.    Spent with my best friend, Sarah *waves*, and her adorable 2 year old son, James. One had a seasonally purple-and-black coloured toe as a result of bouncing happily down the stairs in a moment of unguarded abandon; the other had a streaming cold, a fever, and wanted to eat sweets and watch Thomas the Tank Engine at 1 a.m.  (I'll let you decide which was which...)  This was a nice, restful evening. Kinda. Well, compared to going out dressed in an assortment of silly(-er than we normally wear) clothes, getting out of our trees and scaring innocent passers-by into speechless horror, anyway. (Which is how I usually spend the season)  We didn't make it to Eve's party; but we did have a nice, sane, calm and refreshingly quiet time, which left us feeling all warm, gooey and revitalised.  As it turned out, we really needed it...    # Heff's Parents come to visit.   It was an EXCELLENT incentive FINALLY to sort out the house - which was fun, as we left ourselves about 5 hours to do a 2 week job of sorting, tidying and cleaning.   I am anally retentive about the state of the house at the best of times; but, wanting to a. make a good impression on the in-laws and b. needing to distract myself from the terrible feeling of impending doom, I was in asshole overdrive for this one.  So all the boxes had to be emptied or stackedf upstairs ("NEATLY, Heff!!"); drawers, cupboards and wardrobes had to be tidied; all clothes hung up; bathroom and kitchen made totally sterile; curtains and pictures re-hung; everything scrubbed dusted and polished; windows, mirrors and paintwork washed; every scrap of carpet hoovered ("...don't forget BEHIND the sofa, Heff!") and every wisp of spiderweb feather-dustered to oblivion. The cat, bemused that his bed (a cardboard box of books, with a piece of cardboard packing on top, conveniently pressed RIGHT up against the radiator in the dinind-room) had been summarily banished to the back bedroom, pretty-much fled for the duration.  I even scrubbed the wardrobe, for chrissakes.  *hides face in embarassment*  The result?  Sparkly house.  Maniac and exhausted occupants.  Shortly after the last dust-particle bit the...er...dust, at 6 on Saturday, just as I was getting out of the shower and wondering if I had time to grab a few minutes rest (before having to pretend to be normal, sane and not  at all  like the 36 year-old Whore of Babylon who is corrupting their 21 year old son that they had expected), Heff's crumblies duly arrived.  I think I did okay...?  I fed 'em...we even had wine (neatly getting round the corkscrew issue by procuring it in a box with a tap) (oooh, sophistication-a-go-go, huh?); and I managed to remember not to swear too much or wriggle out of my underwear half-way through a conversation with his mother....  ...at least, they didn't bundle him into the back of the Range Rover in the middle of the night, flee the scene screaming abuse out the windows, and call in the Vice Squad...  So it  appears   that I got away with it!!  *gloats*  Actually, I am being a weensy bit over-dramatic.   (*shock* Who,  ME ...?!!)  I was  slightly  petrified-into-almost-total-manic-catatonia before they got here; but, despite what the Boi had led me to expect (he's at that  difficult  age), his olds are, like,  totally  cool. Actually, they remiind me quite a bit of my own wrinklies.  Now there's an interesting bijou-nugget-ette of psychological insight, huh?  Meeting them has helped me understand a lot more about the Boi than before. (Sorry babes!) It was kinda like the last piece of the jigsaw: now we know that everyone approves of everyone else, it's like we can breathe a huge sigh of relief and get on with our lives. Funny, isn't it: I didn't realise how important it all was to us both 'till after it had happened. By Saturday night, when we fell - aching, hysterical and completely exhausted - into the single bed in the spare room, we were both feeling pretty blissed out about the world in general - and our little lepton of it in particular.  So that was alright, then.  (We will gloss over the 12 hour straight that Heff spent re-acquainting himself with his PC, and all the games he couldn't play on my crap-machine-from-hell, leaving me completely alone and bored shitless, on Sunday....lest we spoil the warm, fuzzy glow...)  The oddest thing, tho, is that something Heather sent me today reminded me, viscerally, of the emotions I felt when I first laid eyes on a picture of Heff...a complete stranger on a perverted little website I lurked voyeristically on at the time, for lack of anything more entertaining to do.  I just.... knew ...him. Something about the world-weary expression on his face spoke to me like a piercing shriek.  I thought 'oh my GOD!!' and decided I was going to have him.  I made a cunning little plan.  I never REALLY expected it to work - especially when he kept going off with American women (oooh look: Heff wants to move to the 'States!!); but in the end it did.  Actually, it only took 390 days (exactly) to pull off.   I'm so fucking clever, me.   I dunno what's going on, tho - worryingly (and uniquely) a scheme actually panning out, and me getting what I want, seems to be turning out pretty bloody well at the moment.  *still keeping a wary eye out for Fate sneaking up behind her with a big iron skillet and an eevyl grin on his/her/its face*   For a variety of reasons, I am UTTERLY exhausted today: far too knackered to write about the main reason I am so totally fuct, in fact.  Suffice it to say, 48 hours ago, we were looking forward to a period of splendid isolation and boredom (with a little noisy debauchery thrown in for the entertainment value; and we had no telly.  Now we have an American lodger; I get to see if my branecells are still firing; and we have a telly!!  But that's a whole 'nuther bag of ferrets - in which I shall rummage around tomorrow.  Bring antiseptic and some plasters, okay?   Those little fuckers bite like bastards, you know....

      OMIGODSOMIGODSOMIGODS....  Two thoughts:  1. WHY do I seem to go through this thing where nuffink happens, I spend mucho time in bed; then, suddenly, everything happens at once?  2. Talking of bed....Evie is here and I am totally thinking about pouncing on her....  Now my pizza has arrived, so I am going to go and eat it.  P.S. Looks like we have a lodger. And a 'Mercan, to boot!! There ARE still cool people in the world: and I seem to have met most of them, recently.  Who Knew?  Oh....and thought 3: now I have this whole commenty-type thing on here, why does no one comment? I'm starting to get paranoid here, guys....  *giggles in a horrible girlish fashion*  (don't tell, okay? My reputation's been taking enough of a hammering lately...)

      Oh dear.  It's all becoming rather sad. In a completely unsurprising way - alas.  Having been sent a link, I just read Noel's blog and Shay's new blog; and am a little disappointed - not to mention endlessly bored and fucking wearied -  about what they've decided to do now.  Really, I could  - and should - care less what they're up to. I certainly wouldn't wish to try and ram my opinions down anyone else's throat. Which is the MAIN reason that, in an attempt to remain on good terms with Noel, I told him that I didn't want to talk about the situation with himn and Shay and John. I know he thinks it's tough that he can't come and bounce at me about how wonderful things are - well, he could; but I don't wanna hear the details. I am entitled to my opinion, after all; and it IS just my opinion; but I am not going to nod and smile when I think he's being a moron. I'd rather just not mention the subject at all beyond him saying that he's happy.  Trouble always was with Noel that it would never be enough. He couldn't accept the embargo on discussing something that was always going to end up as a fight because we disagreed on it  He'd always want to try and convice me that he was right. And, in this instance, having forced me into a corner and demanded to know why I felt as I did, it's a bit sad that he can't then cope with what I tell him.  Saddest of all: that, having told him my personal opinion - to which I am entitled; and which I never wanted to discuss with him, he's now building the whole thing up into some kind of a monster battle.  It's not like that.   I make my own decisions for my own reasons.   I decided to de-hotlist Noel and Shay because it seemed, under the circumstances, to be the right thing to do. Obviously Noel was upset when I told him what I thought; and I realised that the upshot was going to be that he and I couldn't really be friends anymore: too much had been said.   I think he's being a shit. I'm allowed - it's my opinion. I think that, considering how hurt he was about Heff and I being together - even AFTER he'd moved out; his insensitivity borders on the psychopathic. BUT. That's just MY opinion. No one has to agree with me; and I don't care about any of it enough to be bothered to even talk about it to anyone else unless they ask - at which point I will tell them. Just like I told Noel when HE asked.  So I'm not going to be a bloody hypocrite and pretend like we're all just buddies: I don't work like that.   However, now the paranoia is setting in. Like I'm trying somehow to fuck them over. Like I'm trying to make people hate them for some reason.  What the fuck is that all about?  What   possible   motive could I have for that?  I haven't said very much of anything about it to anyone I know; it's not something I'm especially concerned about. True, I am sick to death of people asking me about the whole thing - like I either know or care; but that's easily solved with a 'don't know - you better ask him'.  And that's at the root of it: Noel just can't believe that I - and everybody else - wouldn't be just totally fascinated by everything that goes on in his life. He can't seem to realise that, on a day to day basis - and certainly at the moment - I've got far more important things to worry about than what he's up to. I don't want any more shit in my life: which is precisely WHY I made the decisions I have not to have any more involvement with him. It's not a malicious thing; just the best way to stop any more grief occurring. For either of us.  There's a real desperation about the whole thing though - he and Shay seem determined to keep the whole thing going by posting on b.com and now blogging about it at every opportunity. They seem fixated on creating some kind of conspiracy that allows them to feel persecuted and victimised. Noel must not have been paying much bleeding attention if he thinks I could - even if I wanted to - have any influence whatsoever over people like Nick, Sarah and Heather. Christ, I spend more time with Pin'ead, these days, than I do with any of the others; and I don't notice HIM giving Noel the cold shoulder. Or Dave; or Melissa (were she still here).    Perhaps he would do better to mail some of my so-called 'co-conspiritors' and actually ASK them what's going on - rather than jumping to paranoid conclusions.  But I guess blaming me saves him having to take any responsibility for his own relationships himself: easier to convince himself - and anyone else who will listen -  that I am somehow poisoning all his friends against him.  Please.   It's all so very primary school.   It's almost funny - were it not so very sad..  Well, here's a newsflash: I don't have a 'camp', I am not interested in 'interfereing', I really don't care one way or another WHAT happens. Noel asked me for my opinion; I told him; he didn't like it; so he's making it into a whole big drama.  For me, I am going to get on with my life. Things are pretty bloody good at the moment; I am happy and settled and shit is getting sorted. When I have spent the last month worrying about whether I'm going to lose the person I love the most in my life, not to mention what's left of the rest of my family, why the  fuck  would I give a good goddamn   what   Noel's choosing to do with his life? Now it's all getting sorted, and things are looking so much better for Heff and I, why the hell would I waste time thinking about Noel? Christ, I ended the damn relationship; and, whatever the reasons, obviously it was what I wanted to do. If I wanted to run his life, I wouldn't have asked him to move out.  Whatever I think about his current relationship is irrelevant: as long as everyone concerned is happy, good for them: it's very firmly - as I told Noel at the outset - none of my business. And the kinds of hysteria and mawkish self-pity the two of them seem intent on providing as entertainment to the public at large equally has sod all to do with me.  And that's just the way I would like it to stay, thank you all very much.  And yeah, this may be sinking to their level; but I am sick to fucking death of the whole damn thing. So now I have had my say: starightforwardly, openly and honestly; without any hinting, innuendo, snide self-pitying implications; and without anyone having to infer anything - and it should all be perfectly clear to everyone.  That said, now I have no intention of either speaking, or thinking, or wasting any more time - either publicly or in private -  on the whole sorry bloody subject.  Lets everyone just get on with their own lives and leave everyone else's alone, huh?

        Yohoho and a bottle of something eevyl with a ded arthropod at the bottom...    (Don't mail me: if I  want  an arthropod, I can   have   a bleedin' arthropod - alcohol sodden or otherwise - okay?)  Heather's still here.  Tuesday - she didn't get out of bed till 4pm.  Wednesday - she fought through some snow at an ungodly hour of the mid-morning, only to get stuck behind someone trying to negotiate passage to Penge in Swahili, or summat - missed bus.  Now I'm hoping that it snows like an absolute bastard tonight, so we get to keep her.  We have formed the Triumvirate of Eevyl: Slasha, Basha, and Flasha. I'll leave you to guess which is which.   (Not even close, hon!)  'Part from that, J still shitstirring like a fukka. I have given up on the idea of having her officially and publicly strung up.. This is because I know that, in the end, it will be my arse in the frying pan; and I still have D as ammunition should any more wheels start to look a bit wobbly.   Besides, from the latest round of 'he said, she said", it is obvious that J has VASTLY miscalculated. If she's not extremely careful, the whole thing will end up exploding in her face.  Actually, given her arrogance, and the fact that she really does seem to think she knows the score - but is mistaken as to the nature and quality of the relationship around with which she is fucking, I am hopeful that this will be the case.  It would give me the utmost satisfaction to be the cause of her downfall after all - and without actually having to do a damn thing!  Well, they do say that what goes around comes around.  Then again, they say every cloud has a silver lining, honesty is the best policy and the meek will inherit the earth. (I think the last one was a typo: someone hit 'm' instead of 'g')  I have spent a miserable couple of hours doing the shopping online. I know that, in the longrun, it will be easier, quicker, cheaper and less psychotic-homicidal-episode-inducing; but today really suckedass. I wish someone could come up with a way for all the necessary groceries to appear in one's kitchen without the verb 'to shop' having to be considered at any stage.  Pills - that's what we should eat. We should have our stomachs stapled at birth; and only need to take nutritionally-balance pills for sustenence.   Think of the money the NHS would save! No crap-diet-induced heart disease, strokes, high blood-pressure, diabetes, anorexia, bullemia, anaemia, cancer, anafalaxis....AND I would still be able to do all the other things I enjoy, to wit: drink vodka, JD and (Decent) Champagne; smoke, eat chocolate, give mind-expandingly fantastic head and drink mango juice!  Nirvana!  Apart from that, I have...uh....laid around playing FFIX; and monged about w/Heather. Heff even managed to pay the water bill - I'm so proud!   Heffy seems to be cheering up again. I'm intermittantly worried by his 'low' moods - I know how much pressure he is under. I think having Heather here has made everything seem less oppressive, though; plus, we went out and had some real fun on Monday; and he's been sleeping better.  Also, I think he's looking forward to hanging out with his mates in Edinburgh. It should do him some good to cut loose for a couple of days. Though I am seriously jealous - I've always wanted to go to Edinburgh. Sod the cat and his bleedin' medication.  Which reminds me: I must take the little bugger for his jab. He's not as mental as he usually gets: but it  is  overdue; and, as his mother, I can see the signs.   I'm praying that I'll get him there before it becomes open-season on other people's kitchens again. I really don't think I could deal with a repeat of the 'chicken kebab' incident.  After her being away, and all the fam'ly bullshit, I finally managed to speak to S last night. She seems alright - ish. The guy she was hopeful of turns out to be a knob.   Just for a change, like.  First he texts her to ask her out. Then he keeps texting her with uncool guff like 'I can't stop thinking about you', 'I can't wait to take you out'  'what are you doing to me?' kinda thing. Then, when she texts him back reminding him that she really doesn't want to get into the whole relationship thing, he sends her 'I wasn't intending to take you for a candle-lit dinner' in a 'fuck you' kinda way. What an asshole.  Still, at least she actually DODGED this bullet.  I've said that she'll have to come over: so we can do Christmas, at last; and to show her the latest bum-curling profile pics. That should cheer her up - schadenfreude always does!! That's why I love her so - she's an eevyl cow.   On the same subj. The Legendary Fuckwit, D, was out on Monday: having claimed to S that he was going home. The general local consensus was an indignant 'he's got a nerve'; mostly supported by enthusiastic 'if he comes near me I'm gunna smash him one' sentiments.   S has far more support round here than she realises, I reckon. Not many people seem at all confused about who is the selfish, irresponsible, juvenile cretin of the former relationship. At least he's getting to her less - now that she's realised  exactly   what a total waste of molecules he is.  Tomorrow I am going to make a solid effort to start sorting out the bookroom. I suddenly realised that there are now heaps of books all over the sodding house: not only is it driving me nuts, but I can't find anything when I want to read it. Plus, the shelf-space must have nearly doubled with Heff's shelves; so there is hope that a reasonable level of organisation is fibnally achieveable. It would be so cool to be able calmly to walk in and get a book without:   a. tripping over the hoover (separate issue);  b. having to wade through several boxes to find said volume;  c. being terrified that a whole load of boxes were going to fall on my head and;  d. a whole load of boxes falling on my head.   It would be refreshing, also, not to have a whole load of boxes sitting in a bloody-great pile the dining room. Albeit that Heff has cleverly disguised them by throwing a blanket over them and making a (very Goth) alter on the top  - through the addition of a couple of large candles and a skull.  There's still so much sorting to do in this house that, although I'm still stressed about what I have to do, I'm constantly remembering the things about which I have been stressed for so long that, although they still haven't been done, I had forgotten to be stressed about them (until I remember them; then I get stressed about them again).  And that's not counting all the Destroy It Yourself stuff we need to start, now that Dee actually owns the place. The quarry-tiles in the hall moan piteously at me for their freedom from under the carpet every time I go upstairs. It's breaking my heart. (And I'm a bit stressed about it, too.)  The upshot of the cumulative effect of all this stress is that I'm not actually feeling very stressed at all right now!  (A little weird and hyper-maniacal; but that's tantamount to 'normal' for me.)  All things considered, I'm pretty damn chirpy, up, happy, contented, hopeful, positive and optimistic.  Though the delusions don't seem to be subsiding....  Ahhhhhhhhhh.....life's just one long blast, isn't it?  (Think  'rocket propelled grenade' )  >:-]

      Hahahahahahaaaaa!!  Bin out; got mildly wrecked, did a bit of bouncin, saw some folks, hedbanged a bit, did some eevyl fixing up of mates: had fun!!  It's 3.13; I just cleaned up the kitchen (MAXIMUM brownie-points to me); am now off to bed to eat schwartz-valder kirscher torte andf fuck the Heff soundly. If he's not asleep by now.  I shouldn't be laffin really: the grandmother situation has deteriorated beyond belief. Time for someone to start making waves: look like it's gunna be me and Dee. Whoop de doo.

      Well, okay, so I'm on a bit of a downer then, hey?  Well, I was.  But now I've been comprehensively Glampered, I'm feeling a LOT better.  That woman is so adorable. It pisses me off quite a lot that people don't take the time to get to know her. Then again, their loss....heh, heh, heh!!  I adore that mix of massive, sick, twisted violence; cute, cuddly, huggy adorableness; and mind-warpingly appalling, constant, deafening, naff humour.  It's odd, yanno: there are very few people I can stand to have in the house for very long; and even people I don't mind are definitely 'there' - if you know what I mean; but the ol' Glampticia is just like one of 'us'. I feel very comfortable with her here. More than that, it's just great having her around: I like the company - we both like the company - and it subtly changes the dynamic between Heff and I in a very positive way. We bitch at each other far less; and niether of us feels as isolated. Perspective, I reckon.  Anyway, it's all good: wish she could stay longer.  Hope she's not bored shitless, appalled by the mess (and the fact that I've spent two days in bed since she got here) and will consent to come back and saty for longer next time.  I mean, we haven't even got round to taking her to see the Giraffe yet.  ooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooohhhhhhhhhh...............  Currently, it's sitting opposite me, at Heffy's desk (I'm gunna have to give her danger money for that, too) troughing sausage roll and telling me about her evening round at Nick's.  It rawks!!  Apart from that, most of the stress is abating.  The house is FINALLY the property of Dee....I can take up the hall carpet, and start stripping the walls. I also don't have to worry about paying the bleeding rent 'till all the housing benefit is all sorted. This is just as well: without the money coming in for last month's rent, we'd all be starved to death by the end of the month.  Happy days!  The Gran has also survived her operation - she now has a pig valve and leg veins keeping her heart going - and, although she is creating chaos, misery and much wailing and gnashing of teeth among the family, there are signs that, AT LAST, light is being noticed and feet are being put down with firm hands.  She is a drama queen, though. But now that a complete moratorium on alcohol has been enacted (she's finished the bottle of brandy my aunt gave her; and the bottle of scotch Judith gave her - just don't bleedin ask. I despair.), the confusion and general pissiness may abate somewhat.  I also decided "sod it" and mailed Lori, so we're back in touch. We've discussed the potentially sensitive political situation and have agreed that this will not be discussed, thereby avoiding her ending up feeling like she has to 'take sides'. I'm glad we're in contact again: I've really missed her.   The Noel thing has finally resolved itself in my head, as well. I've decided that hypocrisy isn't me - makes me feel bad about myself. So, on the basis that it seems impossible to be in contact with him without the subject repeatedly coming up; and on the basis that I am sick and tired of friends cornering me to try and find out [quote] "is Noel still alive? I haven't heard from him for months"; "Can't you talk to him"; and what the  fuck  is Noel  DOING , anyway?", I'm just keeping the hell away from everything connected with it.   Besides, Heff is severely underwhelmed by Noel at the best of times; one more upset like the last one and I will probably be unable to convice him that going round and smashing Noel's teeth down his throat wouldn't be very helpful. At the moment, he's maintaining that it would make him feel SO much better that it would be worth the ag.   *sigh*  All told, I reckon it's for the best, in the end.  C'est la vie...I guess.  Ho hum.  Anyway, off to make puttanesca for the masses: have to think of a way to sneak the anchovies into the sauce, and the can into the bin, without Heffy seeing.  *grinz eevylly*

      So.  I haven't done this in a while.  Too scared to, really: afraid of what might just come pouring out. Delicate sensibilities, fragile egos etc; best to keep it to myself. If only because the hopper is already pretty full and I don't need any more shit from people who, really, don't matter.   Either to me, specifically; or, generally, as human beings.  No names, no pack-drill: they know who they are by now.  Yes, it is still unremitting shit. Everything is going to hell. EVERYTHING. And there's no end in sight at the moment. I have given up on the 'we're nearly there' thing: it's like the 'when X happens, I'll be happy' thing - you end up living your life for some mythical, perfect, future; and, before you know it, you're middle aged and, in the rush towards the future, have forgotten to enjoy the present.  Although 'enjoy' is a moot point.   "Accept and deal with" would be a start.  So I have  accepted  that it's all shit; all  likely  to be shit for the forseeable future; and beyond the shit I can see, there is only likely to be more forms of shit just over the horizon; and beyond that who the fuck knows, and who the fuck cares?  I am also  dealing  with the fact that it's all turned to shit by simply not giving a good goddamn; and by ignoring anything that is not directly MY shit; plus not getting excited about anything that looks like it might  not  be total shit.  Because, the most depressing and destructive forms of shit, I have found, and the ones I am least able to cope with, are those I haven't seen coming.  At least if I am a pessimist, I can only ever be  pleasantly  surprised - right?  I don't mind dealing with the bollox that stems from my own feebelness/uselessness/ineptitude - of which there is a fair amount about, admittedly; but what reduces me to utter blind and uncontollable fury and despair is the endless crap caused by other people. Usually, this takes the form of a little oversight or decision here and there that means little or nothing to the person making it; but has the effect of sending my whole world crashing down in pieces, taking the remaining fragments of my sanity and self control - hence also whatever pitiful level of self-respect I have managed to crawl up to - with it.  But hey, who cares? My mental incompetence is MY problem. Everybody else has the right to just get on with their own lives without giving a second thought to what's going on in my putrescent head.  Hell, I try not to think about it, either.  Apart from the recurring image of me, cold, on a metal slab in some morgue somewhere; which, while terrifying and disturbing at one level, is starting to develop distinctly alluring overtones.  Oblivion would be preferable to this.  I'm bored: cosmically and totally. The one thing I have NEVER managed to endure for long is boredom. I spent all this time joyfully training my brain, channelling the only gift I have into something worthwhile and productive, only to have it crash on me. So all it's been used for in the last year is working out how many days till the rent's due, how long I've been awake for and how many pills the cat has had today.  True, my brain started to recover a little from the effects of what is politely termed my 'illness' a few months ago. Unfortunately, it can't shake itself free enough from the grinding, frustrating and lunacy-inducing complications of the never-ending nightmare I am forced (now I am facing up to things in the present) to call my 'everyday life'. With all that this has meant, my brain has never been clear and stable enough, for a long enough period of time, to start doing anything of value - to it, me, or anyone else.  I wanted to study and to write; but I am now putting these ambitions into the file marked "Hopeless Pipe-dreams".  I can see that there is going to be MORE than enough trauma and stamina required just to hang onto the little positive stuff I have in my life at the moment. Expecting anything else is just plain fucking moronic. It's like getting every piece of clothing I own printed with the legend "Kick Me", then expecting not to be kicked.  Then again, I do still have a choice.   Technically.  I could clear the decks (yet again) and start over.   I always have the option of disappearing and starting again. I could move to a new place, make a couple of new friends and kip on their sofa for a bit while I sort myself out a new life, starting from scratch, without being dragged down by all the crap I'm embroiled in at the moment.   I could just re-invent myself totally: become a totally new person: a perfected version of who I am now - but without all the shitty, useless, miserable things that I am that I so despise at present.  Freedom.  This is another long-held, wistful, ambition; but this time, the years I have spent considering it, planning and fantasising, make it more of an achieveable goal.  I know HOW to do it. The why is also obvious; and the where is pretty much sorted, too.  I guess, in the end, the only thing holding me here now is guilt; and, with what's been happening lately, the guilt is losing its grip on me pretty damn fast.  Why cling onto things when they do me nothing but harm?   Is it really so selfish to put one's own self-preservation and happiness before some nominal duty to people who purport to care but, in reality, do little to prove it beyond saying so; or who charge too high a price in obligation, gratitude and increasing self-loathing for the miniscule efforts they do make, when they can spare the effort, on my behalf?  I dunno.  I live in my own head: like everyone else, I have no other perspective.  Mostly, it just depresses the hell out of me how often I can spot trouble before it gets here, only to be told I'm being pessimistic. Funny how people forget they've said this when my 'pessimistic' predictions turn out to be spot on.  So.  The reason for this depressing, self-indulgent, pessimistic rant: the next truckload of unbearable grief has just left the depot.   This one I DID see coming, some while ago. I just wasn't expecting it quite this soon; leaving me so little time and so few resources, with which to attempt to head it off. Fate does so like to spring these little surprises on me: keeps it interesting and undermines any subtle sense of justification I may develop in the face of the predicted disaster.  Anyway, I know what this one is going to be; it's started already; and the whole situation plays out with such perfect lucidity in my head, in all its equisite misery, that it feels like it's happened already: that horrible, exhausted, sad, sense of  deja vu . I know what's coming; but were I to mention the specifics to anyone, I know what they'd say. They'd use words like depression, negative, pessimistic, cynical (another favourite), paranoid, selfish, delusional, self-fulfilling, self-indulgent, ungrateful.   This doesn't bother me much in this instance; the approaching crisis  itself  does. It's another of those no-win situations where, no matter what you do, you're going to expend a whole lot of emotion, energy, time, thought, words, sleep and pain; and, at the end, when it's finished, none of the possible outcomes are going to make you happy.   It will start off as flat denials (while the evidence is slight and deniable) and lead up, somehow, through agression and defensiveness, to the kind of admission where it is made plain that, in a way not  quite  , specifically, definable, the whole thing is (at least in part)   MY FAULT  .  I am thinking about facing up to it head-on and just quitting while I'm behind; but the rest of the world still thinks I'm ahead on this one; and it would cause no less misery, in the long run, than sitting back and watching it all unfold as predicted.  I can't be bothered, frankly.  I'm losing, either way.  So what   IS   the fucking point?  What is the fucking  point .  Why go through it?  I wonder about this a lot. Why go through it.   If the only way to get through each agonisingly frustrating and painful day is to hope for a better one, at some (unspecified) time in the future - when all your experience, rationale, logic and deduction tells you this will never happen - why, then, continue to endure them any more? Is this not the definition of masochism? Is it not repeatedly stated that one can expect no pity for things one is not forced to endure? Does this not extend from the specifics of life to life in it's general sense? And is each person's pain, and their ability to cope with it, not a personal, subjective calculation - one that can only be made by each individual for themself?   Having thought about this for a while now, I can come to only one conclusion that makes sense of anything; and that's that choice, freedom, self-determination and the ability to take full responsibility for your own life and happiness are a complete illusion. A  myth; a fairytale; propaganda put forward by those without these kinds of issues in their lives, who would rather insist on deprecating the misery of others than face the reality that there really  are  people who don't want their lives anymore; who can't live them through endurance and sufference; who won't accept  that there is a purpose to all of it.  I begin to see the point of religion and therapy after all. Intellectually, I've known this all along; but now I really   GET   it: in terms of it's reason, purpose and method of functioning, in all its minutiae. Finally I understand how and why they're not about being truly 'well' and 'happy'; but are simply about being forced to do what is most comfortable and convenient for everyone else - the 'normal', 'healthy', 'happy', majority.   It's like every 'persecuted minority' with which I have ever identified has been thrown into sharp focus; and the whole dymnamic makes contextual sense, now. "They", that is, 'people' - 'normal' people - just don't want to have to look at anything that they might define as 'unpleasant'. They fix themselves within the comfort of their own world and will fight tooth and claw against anything that might force them to re-evaluate anything fundamental.  Their own truth is THE truth; their own 'Right' is the ONLY way; their own philosophy is the only 'sanity'; their way of living is the only HEALTHY. Everything else is unhealthy, destructive, pornographic (in its true sense) and evil. Evil is, essentially, anything that scares 'us', that is not understood, unpalatable and unable conveniently to be ignored. And,   they   fear, all this stuff is contagious: not challenging it on every occasion is a tacit admission of its right to exist; allowing it to exist risks contact; contact with it risks 'infection': end of happy, normal, healthy world.   This being the case, why wouldn't 'they' want to force everyone else to accept their models and standards - rather than have to give a real, sincere, genuine shit, or anything that might even remotely pass as attention or acceptance, to anyone who believes differently?  I wouldn't.  Even though, every day, I do.   Because they have the upper hand: they're 'normal', 'healthy', 'sane', 'mature', 'reliable', 'productive'. They have the right of condemnation because I'm none of these things; whereas, because I'm none of these things, I have no right to disparage their 'madness' as I see it.  I have no right to my differences; they will never make me 'happy'. I have no choice but to accept; to at least  desire  to comply or be defined as 'deviant' and 'sick'.  At best a sympathetic, condescending pat on the head; at worst a repeated, angry, kick in the head.  I have no right to say that I cannot deal with my life and don't want it; I have no way of legitimately rejecting their 'help' to make me 'normal' again; but I have no right to sort out my own life, and be 'happy', in my own way - if it conflicts with the 'sane' and 'healthy' way of going about things.  Rationality, logical argument, and the fact that I have a certainty about my own life's path that cannot possibly be apprehended by anyone that is not 'me', is utterly irrelevent.   Depression ,  madness : it's when your eyes open and you finally see the truth, it seems.  So I guess I'm just out of options.  QED, really.

        Sunday....     MOOD:....  Happy but wobbly.   M.A.D Level:....  2 - fighting mild panic.   MUSIC:.... Radio 4   FELOID:.... Fast asleep sunggled up to his Daddy.    Ooooooh, Heff-tacular!! The little darling is back: honeymoon period in full swing. I'd almost forgotten how  QUITE  how  totally delicious and adorable he is.    He's still full of cold and coughing like a fucker, though; so I'm looking after him a bit. Gonna go forage for cough mixture soon. Letting him sleep for now. He looks almost unbearably cute rolled up in the duvet, snoring his head off; with the feloid perched, drooling and snuffling, on top of him.  *sigh*  Had weird dreams all night: being in a carnival; walking round some hilly, paved town with Huwie, listening to Teardrop Explodes on my walkman, in an attempt to ignore some of the assholes that were about , and who seemed to wanna tell me all about their sad, emotionally stunted, materialistically discontented, tedious little lives.  Nothing that a chainsaw and some leather braided thongs wouldn't have sorted out; but I was s'posed to be on my best behaviour.  We were trying to find a shop that sold cream doughnuts for my Dad; but they were all closed. The town was familiar: I think it was St. Ives. I miss Cornwall.  Then I went on this boat which was a 'fish and chip' cruise; only the smell of frying was making me seriously heave.  So I went to try and find a tender to escape on, only to find it drifting away from the main boat.   Apparently I woke up Heff at this point, shouting  "grab the painter!! Quick! Grab the painter - it's getting away!!".   It's okay, though: he   KNOWS   I'm nuts; so he doesn't try to understand what's happening in my twisted skull.  So imagine the thrill of finding the Quizilla nightmare thing - someone (evidently psychic) sent me a link.  My reputation is secure: I  AM  a bloody nightmare, after all! I always hoped so....  In other news, spoke to the Gran, finally. I wish she'd learn to leave her bloody phone switched on...or at least not moan like a bastard coz I never phone her.  Still haven't finished the bloody shawl: had to undo half of the second side on Friday.  bugger.  Gotta abandon it for a bit, too, coz rent officer comes on Wed; so I have only a couple of days to make the place look amazing, and convince him it's worth the vast sum the landlord wants.  Trouble is, if I do too good a job, he'll say I don't need all this space and I'll have to move. Hope the shrink won't mind sending out another round of  'she's too insane to move house'  letters.  I love dealing with authority: hardly makes me feel guilty, pathetic and inept at all...  *sigh*  Well, better get the study sorted out. I have a good, sound, logical plan of action, based on critical path analysis.   So that'll be chaos for the next three days, then.  Incidentally, Nick: I think it's really mean that I can't comment on your blog. Not that I generally have much of a clue wot you're going on about; but still....    .

        FRIDAY - at last!!  *maniacal bouncing*     MOOD:....  Happy Space Cadet   M.A.D Level:....  dropped off scale - not sure which end, yet.   MUSIC:.... Nirvana - Bleach/In Utero   FELOID:.... Yowling outside next-door's catflap.    Yesterday was a bit of a non-day.  I was so exhausted, from the untypical crowdedness and excitement of Wednesday, that I slept through most of Thursday. I did wake up at a reasonable (for me) hour, had some coffee, fed and medicated feloid, etc; but I could hardly drag my weary carcase round the house. So I resolved to knit - only to find I was too fucked to do that either.: eyes just wouldn't stay open and I kept fucking up.  So I slept.  Got up at 6pm - feeling GREAT!!  Sadly, it's now 9.30 on Friday morning and I haven't slept since.  I did try - but I was too fucking excited:     HEFFY COMES HOME TODAY!!!    *does somewhat sluggish but nonetheless still deliriously happy little dance*  I can't even  begin  to describe how much I am looking forward to seeing him.  I'm even making chicken noodle soup for lunch: for him and the olds - as they valiantly went to pick him up from the airport; and it's bleedin freezing - far too cold for chicken and salad.   And I guess he's gonna be knackered from partying and coughing and wheezing...  Hope he's not TOO ill and knackered, though....  >=- P  Feel a bit spacy all of a sudden - just imbibed about a pint of coffee coz I know my brane is gunna wanna shut down at about 10; and I still gotta do a bit of tidying and hike to the Co-op to forage.  oooooospacy....  Haven't managed to get me, George and the tube of fleanemesis all together in one room at the same time yet. No more bites....but then, that might not be good news.   I think the 'visitors' may have just migrated into the carpet for a bit to recover.  George's taken to sleeping on the new/old chair all day.  It's been in Huw's garage for about 3 years.  It is damp and smells a bit mouldy.  George, somehow, manages to absorb the smell and distill it down to a  stench .  He's not damp (much); but he smells  FETID .   As in dead babies and rotting dogs mixed up with mouldy bread.  When I was watching the news last night, I kept catching whiffs of what smelled like old sewage. In deference to the 'poofoot' incident, I started experimentally sniffing stuff; and almost immediately identified the source of the unpleasantness as Himself, curled up asleep in the middle of the bed.  He fuckin'  HONKS .  Up close , he just smells strongly like mouldy books; but from a distance, it is  definitely  raw sewage.   How does he DO that?  I bet it's on purpose.  And now that he really IS offensive to the olfactory sytstem, he's being EXTRA cuddly; and looks totally crushed and resntful at me when I won't give him a hug and a good scratching.  I hate cats.  They're so   fucking   vindictive.  I reckon George will be really glad to see Heffy, too: he's been following me about like a bad smell (did I really just type that? I need help: Tarbuck syndrome strikes again) all week,  whining about wanting his 'Daddy'. (ooops: there goes all Heffy's cred: right down the toilet!! >;- P)  Oh well; I can see from here that the chicken stock's just about done. Better go chop some veggies...  *looks around for George*  Sorry - that was unworthy.  (Even for  ME !) . .

        2.40 am    #Update...  Just spoke to Heffy on the phone and I've been eaten alive.  Uh..the two things aren't connected...just  randomly sharing; and brane on go-slo  coz I'm half asleep an I miss Heffy.   But the bleedin cat's getting de-flea'd first thing tomorrow - come Hell or high water.  (And, round here, either is a possibility)  *drags knackered old carcase off to bed - via bathroom, to dig out antihistamine tabs* .

      . .  MOOD: .... YAY!!   M.A.D Level: ....3  (lowish - meds pending)   MUSIC: ....Radio 4   FELOID: ....Upstairs in his cupboard,  obscenely  stuffed with 1 1/2 cans of Felix; asleep.  . .   COOL Fuckin day!!!    Haha!  Lots of nice things, for a change.  Went to dermatologist and have been found suitable for new form of indignity and torture: topical chemotherapy!   Yay!    This is where I get to lie in a big bath of chemical oog for a bit; then get to sit in a kinda light-shower, still covered in oog, and get blasted with UVA light for a bit longer.  Then they let me shower off the oog.  Sounds like a fun day out to me...  After the hidequack, I went into town to meet Jo.  In the scuzziest pub in central Ipswich, Mannings.  Lunchtime, it's packed with 'normals' and uptight squareheads.  Jo, elegantly Gothy in in luvverly buckly strides, replete with interesting scars, black nail polish, eye-liner, jewelry, long hair and broad Californian accent, wasn't too hard to spot.  Feel a bit guilty about him being in there on his own for half an hour coz I was late: it must have been really uncomfortable and embarassing to be seen out in public dressed like that - for the normals, that is... >:- )  Jo is really rather a nice bloke. Cleverer and more articulate than his sound clips make him appear ( quelle surprise ); and interested in lots of cool stuff - about which he actually KNOWS something.   Bonus!!  (Rare, too, IME)  Best bit  #3 was him explaining his impressive scar collection; #2 was that he  totally  gets the whole 'me-and-the-cockroaches-post-holocaust' thing (most people think I've dropped a couple of marbles somewhere when I trot that one out); best bit  #1, though, was definitely when he claimed he used to think I was scary.    I laugh...  (Not sure I believe it, mind. Me? I'm a total kitten: why would anyone find   me   scary?)   *hides chainsaw behind back and radiates innocence*  Anyway, we likes: he was fun - easy to talk to. Hope he comes back -  I didn't get time to show him the giraffe, yet; and I' m really sorry Heff missed him.   (No I'm not: Heff is having fun in Edinburgh, and deserves all he gets, and I hate him!!)  (This is also a lie: I MISS you baby!! Bring Hamlet HOME!!!!)  After that, I went shopping for food in M&S coz I weakened and wanted sushi - even the crappy M&S kind.  Also, today, saw the olds.  Had chat, pissed around, giggled an' stuff.   It's their anniversary tomorrow: 38 years.   Fuck me: that's a LONG time. And they still, like, totally  WUV  each other - despite the fact that they spend a great deal of time bickering.  Perhaps BECAUSE they spend a great deal of time bickering...?  I realised, as I was walking home, that Heff and I are pretty much the only people I know who's original parents are still together - 'cept for Greg, and his are in France.  But 38 years and still all gooey and cuddly with each other is like, almost scary. In a deeply nauseating and sick-making kinda way (pass the bucket).    Not that I'm complaining, you understand; just feeling hopelessly inadequate. Especially in light of the attention this week's  other  events have focussed on the feebleness of my own ability to select a suitable and compatible life-partner. (Tho I  refuse  to have the whole 'age thing' discussion again, ok? It's irrelevent)  Speaking of Ex's - Huwie came over this evening and brought my chair.   It is so cool to see him so happy: and it makes me laugh off my ass to hear him talking about how he has to manage the kids.  Talk about totally smitten!   He's a bit wobbly at the moment though: Jen's an organiser too, and she's told him that they're gonna have to make some plans soon. Which means he's FINALLY gonna  have  to think about what he's gonna do career-wise. I hope he ends up going for a change: 10 years in the same - essentially unchallenging - job, working with the same few people, is about as long as is healthy, I reckon.  He could do with challenging himself - if only so he reminds himself how bloody talented he is.  But anyway, I have another chair.   George immediately wanders in, sniffs it for a bit, drags his claws through the upholstry, claws his way up it till he's perched on the back, sits down and says "Great! You bought me a chair to trash! Hey, thanks!"  I shouted.  He took no notice.  So it's the bleedin eucalyptus oil again, I guess: I'm not re-upholstering the bloody thing just to give him something pretty and clean to shred and slobber on.  It's gunna be the sodding wallpaper all over again, innit? I can see it coming. (Huw tells me the  other  little bastard has now ripped off virtually all the bits I fixed.) Still...*smiles happily*...not my problem any more...*remembers vast seas of woodchip waiting to be removed in current dwelling*....*smile drops off face like lead-lined droppy-thing*  *gloom*  Oh god. The decorating.  No, I am NOT thinking about it today...  But I DO have to face up to only having one-anna-harf days left to finish Gran's shawl.  *Stern Voice raises its eyebrows at Sasha*   And exactly  how  far did you get,  Sasha, since the  last  time you blogged on this subject?   *hangs head*  *mutters indistinctly*  *looks embarassed*   Well, you better go and get the  fuck  on with it then, hadn't you??   *grins sheepishly and shuffles off to knit and eat sushi in front of the telly*  Ahhhhh....fish-scented knitting....luvverly....   >=- 0 . . .

       MOOD:              Pretty fukkin' good!    >:-0  M.A.D Level:     2  (low)    MUSIC:             Radio 4   FELOID:            Asleep under the radiator; snoring appallingly.     Ha   HA   !!!!     FINALLY   managed to get to top-up my phone online!!   I have CREDIT!!!!  It's only taken me a month - including most of last night and this morning -and cost me a bleeding fortune in phonecalls to the craptacularly inefficient customer service centre. Once you get through to an actual PERSON, they're really great; but first you have to wade through the teeth-itchingly useless automated system, the non-applicable options, being on hold for hours and HOURS, only to be told that you've come through to the wrong department, getting a different phone number from an apologetic vodafone rep, dialling the new number - and going through the whole bloody process again from the start [repeat  ad nauseam ]  And don't even get me   started   on the website....it's even bloody  worse .  'Tis true: Vodafone TOTALLY suxass.   If I didn't want to keep my number, I would change to someone else.  *sigh*  I'm dreading trying to sort out the broadband connection. Might have to get Huwie to do it for me... (cunning plan!)  Still: I can now actually send texts and *gasp* phone people!! Just replied to Carol, as she's on half term and finally around for a bit. Haven't seen her for so long, I've forgotten what the pervy little tart looks like!!  So, well, that's the day practically gone....and I'm in a rambly frame of mind (prepare for endless, boring, waffly blogging). I  was  going to try going into town today: on the bus, on my own - first time in nearly 6 months; but now it's nearly five, getting dark, cold, grey and pissing with rain.   So I guess I'll go and have a crack at the bookroom instead...  *hollow laughter*  Really, I  should  be trying to finish Gran's shawl, as it's her B'day on Sat; but ennui has set in.    Quelle surprise.    Have to steel myself, put on a really good film, and sit and do it tonight. No sleepin or readin till I finish the second side; gives me 3 days to do the ribbing.  God, my life has become THAT boring that I'm blogging about  knitting ??!  Fun....I need fun....    Stimulation, excitement, adventure, novelty, troub....uh....p'raps not that...but something different to do that doesn't involve stuffed giraffes.   I reckon a trip to London looks like a wheeze...haven't done any kulcha for a while.  There's an el Greco exhibition on at the National I'd love to see...tho Heff might be bored...  Wonder if he'd prefer James-sitting...? Then again, not sure it's Sarah's cup of tea, either...  God, I am getting so much better.... even to  contemplete  trains.   Just for a change I slept like a log for hours and HOURS last night, and woke up feeling genuinely happy and positive, for the first time in weeks.  I think it's finally sorting the Noel situation: the last source of real aggravation and significant doubt.   It's been an annoyingly irksome itch at the back of my brane since all the crap started in May. Finally doing what I wanted to do - and   should   have done, all along, has made me feel much better about stuff in general. Guess I must have been more delusional - and for much longer - than I thought, to let it drag on so far.   I feel like a HUGE weight has been lifted from my shoulders.  I don't have to have anything more to do with him.   Pity about all the hassle, though: not much of a  surprise , true; but a pity, nonetheless.  [NTS. Guilt: useless emotion. Always stick to Plan A.]  Had a cool Mail from L yesterday -  the great loon!! She may hjave found a way to move here after all. Hope it pans out, I really do. Need more loony women in my life. Especially now Lissa's left - I miss her.  L is still suffering quite badly though, I think. Not that she'd tell anyone unless they virtually pounded it out of her. She copes with impressive stoicism, overall: you never hear her moaning about things. She just sucks it up and gets the fuck on with it. It must be very hard, though: living in a city where she knows very few people and has little support.    She definitely needs to become a member of the Suffolk Lunatics' Support Network. She'd enjoy the meetings down the pub; and the enforced prescription of regular drunkenness, moshing and hedbanging, and visits to see the giraffe.  I'm so bloody lucky with my family, friends and Heff supporting me through all the crud.   They must have picked up some REALLY bad karma in their previous lives....  =|:- ]  Ma's taking Gran to Bart's for her checkup today. We're all praying that the Docs say she can go home: she's fine physically (except she's not taking enough exercise); and a lot better on the 'marbles' front, too. Almost sounds like her old self; she's lost the frail-sounding feeble note she had in her voice before the op.   Another positive development is that the other side of the family have now gone quiet.  It's a pity that the Aunt has hardly visited Gran since she moved into the new Home; but J has no official involvement with her now - since her practice doesn't cover that area. (Though the place  is   owned and run by her mates - hence the relief when the Old Bag finally gets to go home.)  It's good to be able to have a laugh with her again. She's even taking quite well  to Dad calling her "piggy" and making 'oink oink' noises at her all the time. (He's such a wit.)   I can't imagine how it would feel having a bit of another animal inside you. I'm not sure it wouldn't totally squick me out - even if it was keeping me alive. I remember when Mark had his artificial valve fitted, I felt that it must be horrific for him knowing that his life depended on some mechanical device not going wrong.  *shudder*  I have an appt. with the consultant dermatologist tomorrow - I get to see the olds, too as they're taking me. Fingers crossed they'll let me have another course of treatment - preferably before the effects of the last lot totally wears off and I'm back to square one. Assuming that I can fit it in around the 'therapy' (CBT - *snigger*), that is: it's looking like there's not going to be too much time for decorating in the next few months.  I'm terrified at the prospect of the therapy - it starts next week. I guess this is because, for the first time, I am determined to tell them everything....if I can bring myself to do it. Apart from the trauma of recovering stuff I've spent nearly 20 years trying to block out, it's all a bit fantastic, at this distance. And talking about your own life seems so cringe-makingly self-indulgent, somehow - not to mention bloody boring *yawn*: like having to watch the same film every day for a month.   However, I really think that the time has come where it's got to be done. I can't afford NOT to sort things out, anymore. I can't keep on having this crop up every few years and pissing all over my cornflakes - particularly as it's getting worse and worse each time it happens. Plus, , I have decided, finally - and it looks like I may even have the chance - to do what I've always really wanted to - and I'm buggered if I'm fucking that up. Especially since at last I am with someone I can see pulling in a similar direction and happily building a future with me.  (For a while, at least - as long as it's what we both want, that is)  I've had a couple of dreams about turning up to the Hosp. only to realise I've forgotten to put on any clothes, though!   Can't imagine what   that's   all about...  *grinz*  Forward momentum: Oh God, but it's scary!!  I am such an unreconstructed wuss sometimes: can you spell  ambivalent ?  Better'n being bored tho, I guess....(though the chance to find out would be a novelty).  Hope Heffy doesn't end up with alcohol poisoning - it's the gig tonight, so he's got two days to recover from the hangover before he has to get on the plane.  He's offered to bring me back a present of a cute Scottish grrlie...as   if  !!   *wist*  Besides, no doubt he will have felt it necessary to "audition" her...and I   hate   sloppy seconds...  Then again....with a good scrub...(worked with Heff that time) *grinz eevylly*...and as long as she wasn't actually  broken  already...  *tries to drag brane out of gutter*  ...uh...books....knitting...cleaning...bills...cat....shopping...prescription... getting the fuck on with it....now...(ish)...  'Nuff tedious rambling for now.   >:- )

      Good grief.  I just realised that Heff is only 3 years older'n George.  Strange, scary and highly amusing thought.  Tho it's easier to rationalise with George.  (I can say this stuff without gettin whacked, while the Heffness is in Scotland...you can hardly blame me for making the most of it.)

      Oh joy.  Flu....blurgle.   Heff gone to Edinburgh.  Still, peace and quiet.  Have finally lost patience with Noel and told him I want nothing further to do with him.   This is for the best.   I'm very bored with all his hypocritical, childish, circuitous bullshit; and he can't seem to understand that, after all the stuff he went on about re; me turning all his friends against him etc., I have no trust in him; and even less respect.  Sadly, he now believes so much of his own publicity that he feels it totally unecessary to have to take responsibility.  For anything - period.  Plus ca change....I feel like a moron for expecting anything else, really.  You win some; you lose some, I guess; and it's been a learning experience.  One I fervently hope I'm never stupid enough to repeat.  Moving swiftly on...  I hope that there will soon be a few more perves moving to Ips - misery loving company, it being so damn cool and trendy down here an' all....  Dave and James seem to be having fun, from what I can gather. Interesting txts you get in the middle of the night when they're all drunk and nicking each other's phones!  Planning to shuffle off out tonight and have a laugh - such as it is - at Jest. Good to catch up with people I haven't seen for ages - Jimmy was a hoot the other week; though I found it highly entertaining when he found out how old Heffy was.  Better run off and phone Sarah - see if any developments have....er....developed...?!!

      Okay, I am now getting really pissed off by all the childish juvenility going on in Heff's blog.  The latest is that he's a 'scrounger'; and although I am not certain what this refers to, I have an idea.  If it turns out I am right, I am going to be posting a few little home truths that the perpertrators may not be aware of.  Yeah, I know.   But I won't have Heff dragged into this - just because he has the temerity to state his opinions in his own blog.  Grow the fuck up, people.  If it's gonna upset you, don't read it.  It's called self discipline.

      FABLEEEUS day!!  Heffy got cold and feeling like shit, so I made him stay in bed. Having thus enforced bedrest on him, I felt honour-bound to keep him company...  So had a massive veggy day lying around, watching TV, playing games, pissin about, talking, cuddling...etc...    George just LOVES this: captive audience. He spent most of the day stamping about all over us purring his furry little bollox off. It's hilarious: we've noticed that every time Heff and I hug or cuddle, George will appear from nowhere and insist on joining in! Mostly, he likes mountaineering to the top of the covers, zsitting down so his head hangs over the edge, looking down at us in adoration and, of course, sharing his long strings of stinky drool with us. He also likes to creep up beside me and suddenly poke his cold, wet, bald, purry nose in my ear socket. He gets quite upset when I shriek and leap three feet off the gro...uh...bed.  He adores Heff, though. It's quite pathetic the way the little creep follows him around like bad smell. Heff has even trained him to come when whistled at; I don't get a look in, mate: as soon as Heff whistles he goes storming off down the stairs after him. I also spend half the night having to forcibly persuade him that Heff snoring does not mean he wants some pointy-toed moronic feloid bouncing him into abrupt wakefulness.   Watching him ooze out of the shelf in the wardrobe that he has adopted as his new bed, I still find it hard to believe the little bugger's 18 - let alone dying of kidney disease.   Especially since he's got both Heff and I exactly where he wants us: the entire household revolves around the MadDribblyCatLordDomFromHell.  Still: never a dull moment...  Spent long time on't phone chatting to Huw today. So good to hear him happy surrounded by kids! I always said he'd be a good dad; but he never believed me. He's got it pretty cushy now: all the fun and only a miniscule level of responsibility. I must get round to retrieving the rest of my stuff from his garage; and conning some of the gardening stuff that he's not using, too. Probably BEFORE he takes us to B&Q and ends up lugging bloody great bags of gravel about!! Hopefully, I'll get to meet Jen soon. Not so sure about the kids - they sound a bit (well, a LOT) scary; but it'd be fun to compare notes with Jen - Huwie will have a caniption-fit! Teeheehee!  Aw, bless...  Am a bit concerned about Heff, though. That bloody 'college' he was at seems seriously to have undermined his desire to study. I can't believe the useless shits who are allowed to teach; they seem so bloody cavalier in their attitudes; and, from what he's said, most of them don't have too firm a grasp of their subject, either.  If you're so insecure and ill-informed that you become threatened and nasty in the face of a 1st year undergraduate's questions, you shouldn't be fucking teaching, IMO.  I hope he regains some desire to study eventually; he has such an amazing brain, not only would it be a waste if he didn't use it; but I think that, in the right environment, he'd get so much of a kick out of studying.  Plenty of time for that yet, though.  I need to get well enough to get my shit together and support us, first. I'm not having him hampered by abject penury again if he ever DOES decide to go back and study. Hardly surprising no-one fancies degree courses any more: besides the culture-shock, the debt - despite which they are still poverty-stricken - most of the poor sods are too knackered or stressed by the various jobs they have to do, and the slums they have to live in, to commit any real energy and concentration to getting the best out of studying.  Education, education, education?  Yeah, right.  And I wanna go back to lecturing? I must be off my fucking head. (hahahahahaaaa!! Freudian slip, there: I almost forgot I AM off my head!!)  Still....research....writing.....teaching....travel...an income....maybe even a bursary or a grant....  Hmmmmm....  I wonder how Dee would react if we announced in a year's time that we're moving to Colchester...?

      Woohoo!!  Snot-free day!!  (Well comparatively)  Have decided I wanna do my PhD thesis on different versions of Early 'Christian' belief and later heresies. It's all fascinating; and there's lots of original research waiting to be done because of all the new information that's come to light recently.  Got a lot of reading to do before I can narrow it down enough though; and to gain enough grounding to be able to put together a serious research proposal.  Really, I'd like to learn Hebrew and Aramaic. Well, you never know...wonder how hard it is to find resources to use to learn?  Also, I wanna try and see if I can gain access to Monastic libraries in Ireland. From what I've read so far, seems like there might be some highly interesting stuff lying about from the old Celtic Church - before its capitulation to Rome.  Ooooh - research and a nice long trip round Eire!! Sounds like a plan: maybe I can look for a cottage!  The big thing, though, would be to gain access to the Vatican library. There's LOTS of stuff in there....that they don't want the rest of the world to see....  Wonder if I could pass as a priest for a few years?  Hmmmmm.....the tits might be a bit of a problem...  Oh well.  Blackmail or burglary it is, then!  *grinz eevylly*  On other fronts, Heff and I are knackered. He kept having nightmares, yelling and flailing and waking me up; so I caught it too. Weird one about being in some non-celebrity version of I'm a Celeb. - but with me and John Lydon. Started off as a laff-riot: then Cliff Richard, Alice Cooper and Ozzie turned up and it went kinda downhill from there.  Also dreamed I was living in the house in Layer and someone kept letting off a shotgun. Eventually traced it to two little girls at the end of the road and tried to take the guns away from them; whereupon their father came out and said he was quite happy for the girls to have them. Tried to explain about them already having shot someone in the stomach; but he wouldn't listen.   Wonder what that's all about?  The needles arrived today - bloody quick that was - and I'm impressed with this new co. Heff found. Only trouble is, I thought he'd be getting, like 28 guage needles; but it turns out he's got 22 - they're  YAWJE!!! I told him that he's going to have to work up to sticking anything that bleeding wide - not to mention long - in me. Think I'm gonna try and find some short 28 or 30s to wave at him - and HIDE the others!!  Still, recreation's in the pipeline: gotta be good.   Tho I want a pierced aluminium paddle...  In the middle of sorting out all my paperwork and filing at the moment: god, it's boring. Even the RAWK on the CD player isn't numbing my braine sufficiently: so I'm having to stop for breaks.  I'm using sorting out the book-room as a carrot to get me through it: no gloating over books till all the filing's done!  Heffy's gone into town on his own to sort out the other stuff and leave me in peace to get on with it. We've sorted out the dates he's flying and coming back; and Dad is okay to take him and pick him up.    I really want him to go as I think it will do him the world of good; but I get a bit squicky about it when I think about him not being here. It will be really strange!   On the other hand, what's even stranger is that we've been together 24/7, except for two days over Xmas, since he got here in August - and we haven't killed each other! In fact, now that a lot of the external pressure has died down a bit, we seem suddenly to have got even closer. It's quite sick-making how happy we are!  I think M&D are pretty chuffed: say they haven't seen me this calm and happy for years. It really helps that they love Heffy, too: I don't feel torn - or resentful - any more. Haven't seen either of them for a fortnight: they've been up to their ears in Gran-trauma. Kinda miss 'em. It's their anniversary soon: have to think of something twisted but amusing to get them.  Hmmmmm, I spose a flogger would be going a bit far, huh?  Ah well, guess I better get back to it. BDC is pretty tedious at the moment on the postage front; many of the former entertainments seem either to have resolved their problems or, at least, stopped squabbling in public about it. There was a classic last night though - on the lines of 'I've posted this in a public forum but you have no right to comment': as if the forum they were posting in was exclusively trolled by their 'clan'. I love the way anyone else daring to post gets royally stamped upon.   Ho hum.   Live by the sword, die by the sword?    I reckon.  Which reminds me: must look for a new chainsaw today...  >:¬ )

      Bah...spent most of the day asleep.  Still managed to get through half a box of tissues though: I didn't know it was possible for a single human being to produce so much slimy oog from a single orifice in just a few short hours....it's been quite astonishing!   *mutters darkly*   I'm getting really bloody bored with being ill all the time, yanno? Like I haven't got more interesting things to do.  Tho Heff is getting to look after me - bless him!  He seems really to like it when I'm incapacitated: gets all huggy and cuddly and gentle and solicitous.  It would be most uncharitable of me even to  think  that this has anything to do with the fact that, while I'm sleeping, he gets to spend hours on the PC unmolested...wouldn't it?  Yeah.  So I won't think that, then.  Soul of charity, me.  But it's pretty boring at the moment: I can't even work up the energy to read a book.  Still, I am managing to amuse myself, intermittantly, online...   Found a couple of cool new people to chat with; and the ever-present display of self-absorbed paranoia and righteous indignation on bdc is always good for a smirk or two.   People: they just crack me up. What makes someone think that everyone else is so mesmerised by their pathetic little dramas, anyway?  Aw, but it's still the best pound-for-pound low-brow entertainment I have ever found. Well, everyone's allowed to wade around in the sewer a little bit, from time-to-time...  Gran's thoroughly miserable at the new home - quelle surprise. Dad's insisting she stay there for another four weeks, to make sure she's physically as recovered as possible. Then I guess she'll be champing at the bit to get home. The sooner the better. I don't know how J is taking Gran's sudden forcefulness and control; but I just bet it's not with a philosophical shrug and a smile.  I laugh...  So, Schadenfreude seems to be the theme at the moment. I am a bad person. Highly entertained; but bad, nonetheless!  >:¬ ]    Oooh, I feel the need for my bed overwhelming me again....I mean, Hell: I've been out of it for, what? 25 minutes, at least!!   *gasp*    And it should have dried out by now, anyway.  Plus, having bought all these damn videos, it would be good to go upstairs and watch one with Heff.  Despite that we didn't actually get to watch much of the Mummy last night...  *grinz eevilly*  [NTS: Must make a concerted effort to get to sleep before 4...it's getting ridiculous]  On the up side, the Hefflet finally found a needle supplier and there are now some on the way.  w00t!   Especially double w00t coz   he   thinks they're gonna get exclusively stuck in me: he's deluded.   Come the day of the straightjacket....  *cackles*  I've almost collected enough 'things of eeevyl' to do the whole cling-film/sensory deprivation/sensation play thing, too.   Tho I guess I'd better wait till there's a couple of days where we don't have to do anything; as I'm expecting him to go distinctly brassic-oid, for at least a day or so, when I've finished with him.   Oooooh, nice toppy headspace goodness!!  The caveat being, of course, that I can drag him away from Kings of Chaos for long enough.   Thank you SO much for that, Heather dearest!!    When   did you say you are coming back?  *smiles sweetly, radiating innocence*  Oh, and the  worst  thing has happened: I rested my chainsaw on top of my lamp and the bulb has melted the bottom of it!    I'm totally gutted!!   I was going to take it to bits and paint it and everything; but now the chain won't even go 'round!   What am I going to do without my signature weapon??  *wails and gnashes teeth*

      Bleh.   Have cold.   Feelin oogi.  Woke up at 10.30 this morning: eyes all gummed shut; throat swollen and hurty; semi-deaf; nose sore and blocked; head pounding; nipples excruciating (tho that's a 'nutha story *grinz*).  Had sneezing fit; mopped up ocean of snot, tears, gob etc;  then kicked boi out of bed to make coffee. Was hoping that he might get up and help me stay awake, as we have SO much stuff to do that's urgent.  Yeah right.  He did produce coffee; but then the little sod went straight back to sleep.  I sucked down my coffee and put the telly on, while manfully trying to keep my eyes open through some decorating programme....  .....woke up to find it's 3pm and no sign of the boi.   Phoned through to the house phone - yup. Engaged. Little sod is online - as it turns out, naked - where he's been since 12. He claims he didn't wake me coz I was ill.  So,   has  he attempted to do any of the urgent stuff that needs doing?  What, rather than playing Kings of Chaos, answering email on bdc (flirting with girlies), and looking at piercing sites for needles to poke into my sensitive places, you mean?    You   decide.  Feh.  I forgave him though - I was just feeling ill, grumpy and guilty. Should be used to the routine by now, in any case.  And once I'd bollocked him he did get moving and manage to strip the beds - in between watching cartoons.  He also cleaned up the kitchen (a bit); but managed almost to set it on fire making sausage sandwitches.   Yeah, it's a talent.  I'd never had flambed sausage sarnies before: they were really nice!  Though I haven't assessed the extent of the grease-slick in the kitchen yet. >:-)  Ah sod it. He has   other   talents!!  I'm really missing Heather: the house feels very empty and quiet. 'S strange. Hope she comes back soon: it was great having her here. George misses her too: won't leave us alone; and has spent more time than usual howling bereftly outside next-door's catflap.   I think he may be confused.  But it's so hard to tell apart from the generally high level of incipient lunacy.  He made a huge leap onto the bed last night and slipped on the quilt to end up in an embarassed messy heap on the floor. Tried to do the same thing this morning - slid sideways off the quilt while he was mooching up towards me for his morning cuddle: but I caught him just in tme. Poor little bugger: I'm gonna have to put the indian cotton sheet back on the bed or he's gonna leave in an uber-fit of feloid humiliation.  In other news, I am   FINALLY   going to get some actual therapy at last!  I'm going to start CBT as soon as the shrink can find time in her schedule.  Yup, that's CBT.  "Cognitive Behavioural Therapy" to you..............what did you   think   I meant???  Yeah, I'm going to have to work hard not to snigger every time she mentions it.  Yesterday was, to my shock and awe, NOT a complete waste of time. Seems there ARE intelligent, professional and committed people working in the NHS, after all.   Well, two of 'em, anyway.  It was s'posed to be an hour-long assessment appointment; but what with all the interesting side discussions about psychology, the millions of questions they asked me about my life history (*yawn*), and the discussion we had about the possibility of me getting funding for an MPhil/PhD, I was in there from 11.30 'till 1.15! They were great: for the first time ever I felt like I was talking to people who were genuinely interested in helping me, rather than just ticking off their little boxes.  So the woman (Julia??) is going to take me on, to do some 'untangling' work; and the bloke, who's in his third year training as an OC, and is still a student (he's 44 - hope for me after all!!), is going to get me a copy of some stuff he's got on applying for PG funding.  For the first time, I feel like there   might   be some hope for the future.  Not, of course, that I'm in any way holding my breath: it's still gonna take ages before I'm really well enough; but at least I feel like I'm finally getting some direction in my life.   Other than down, that is.  Oh well. Better go start the mammoth sort out, then.  Heather, hon: we love you - come back soon!    [blatant attempt at blackmail] I'll take you to see the giraffe...

      Heather just left - boo hoo. Will miss her. Hopefully, though, she will be back soon. Thinking of adoption...I have always had a talent for ornery pets....  Got my psych consult in about 45 mins. Only taken 15 months for them to get around to assessing me for congnitive therapy. Yay woo.  I'm bricking it, actually: haven't been able to sleep for thinking about it.  Not that I expect them to fix me; just be nice if someone could point me in the direction of the possibility of perhaps finding the instruction manual that might let me collect together the bits to make the odd tool that I could use, maybe, to tinker about in there myself.  Whell, I can't make it much worse.  And the alternatives look suspiciously like basket-weaving classes and self-esteem-raising groups.  You see this is the problem with going mad: you cease to be an individual and become a series of tick boxes and routing paths.  In this universe, I am suffering from depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies.  Therefore I MUST have: low self-esteem; poor coping strategies; no abilities or techniques to relax; no ability to manage my time effectively; poor reasoning and deuctive skills; a tendency to delusion; problems forming and maintaining positive relationships; low sex-drive; feelings of worthlessness; no sense of direction.  Actually, I have none of these. I know what I am capable of achieving and what I want to do. I know how to manage my time, my household and my relationships. I know I am capable of a high level of academic reasoning; can structure or demolish an argument; can ingest, process and synthesize large quantities of complicated information; can see the wood for the trees, behave in a morally and rationally consistant manner; know how to relax, am keen on fucking and am aware of - though not obsessed with, my various faults, foibles weaknesses and darker tendencies.  The problem is, that to actually accomplish or put into effect any of this stuff, I need a brain that works. One that I can focus, control and concentrate with; that does not produce random, disturbing or distracting thoughts; that does not become overwhelmed and capsize at the first hint of stress. I need my brain to do what I want it to do all the time - not just when it feels like it. I needt the fact that I can see the cause of my problems and that I recognise irrational thoughts for what they are to mean that I can control the effects they have on me.   Mostly, I need to find the energy and will to do more than 15 mins worth of anything and have it take a whole day - assuming I can find a way to reliably get myself out of bed in the first place.  My shrink says I will find all this much easier once I'm not under so much stress.  Great.  She's even probably right.  But let's get real here: there is never going to be an end to stress. With the family I have and the friends and life I have chosen - not to mention the various sections of my existance over which I currently exercise no control whatsoever (eg. finances, when the cat will die, the crapfulness of various sections of humanity) - there is always going to be stress.  If I wait for some magical day when all the stress has disappeared, I'm going to be in a hemp sack under a tree somewhere before I can start to put my life back together.  So I can imagine what I'm going to find myself saying to this guy: and I can imagine his reaction.  I know what's wrong with me - why I'm like this. (No, you don't)  I need you to help me fix myself by understanding the mechanisms of my illness and helping me work round them. (Here's a leaflet on support and councelling in your area. We run a self-esteem group on thursdays; and on Tuesday, there's a seminar on coping strategies, relaxation and managing your time.)  I need proper, psychological, treatment. (This is a list of trained councillors in your area)  I really don't need any of this stuff - it's just going to lower my self-esteem, take all my energy to turn up and depress the fuck out of me. (This patient is arrogant and unco-operative. She is deluding herself that she doesn't need the treatment we give evryone else with the same boxes ticked that I just ticked for her.)  Hello? Is there anyone intelligent and rational I can speak to? (We cannot help her. Next.)  Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.  Cab's here.  Shit.

      I've been trolling about in various forums all night. I'm saddened and confused by most of what I've seen there: the pettiness, the small-minded ignorance; the carelessness with which feelings are treated and the utter pointlessness of most of what people do and say.  Okay: it's only 'online'; yet this seems to be used as both an excuse and a justification for the worst kinds of behaviour. Until, of course, the biter is bit: then 'online' becomes real, painful and no excuse.  I can't believe that people set such low standards for themselves then glorify in their own ignorance, stupidity and meanness of spirit. The selfishness and self-obsession is so palpable; the masks of compassion, humour and pleasantry so flimsy and warped in some quarters as to be sickening.  Most of all, I can't understand how people can justify their behaviour to themselves. Do people really have such flexible morals and easily ammendable codes of behaviour? Do they really believe it's acceptable to behave like this - that anyone even vaguely decent applauds or is impressed by any of it?  Do they really KNOW how they appear to others - not just the sycophants (who wil concur to be 'popular') and fellow travellers (who will support them as a way of justifying their own terpitude) that will bark like dogs on command whatever new depth is plumbed?  It's so widespread: I must have missed the day when the rules all changed.  When did revenge at any cost, for any slight - whether real or misapprehended - become acceptable? When did it become cool to use whatever tiny scrap of information you had or could deduce about a person to cause them as much pain, distress and humiliation as possible?  When did it become okay to hit first and find out the facts later? To hide behind whatever cover is available and snipe without ever coming out in the open and clearly stating a case in a way that can be challenged? How is it okay to be cruel and hurtful to someone else only because 'everyone else is doing it'? And how is it okay then to seek to excuse yourself, with resort to your own troubles as sufficient reason to forgive yourself the harm you did to someone else?  Please tell me: when did it become the norm to put yourself before everyone else? At what point did everybody recieve absolution from responsibility - not only for any duty towards other people, but also for the consequences of their own actions and decisions?  Every day I thank God that I am cynical enough to be;lieve the majority of the human race worthless scum; and that I have the objective reasoning and single-minded conviction to give most of it a wide berth. Yet, every day, even   I   am shocked and appalled at the depths to which some people will sink deliberately to set out to hurt another human being.  I'm mystified: when did compassion and understanding, caution and restraint, self-discipline and forgiveness, responsibility and moral courage, good manners,  consideration for others, decency, tolerance, reason, trust, honour, kindness and faith become such a sign of weakness: both unimportant and so uncool?

      .~*~.  MOOD:.... tired and a bit worried; but happy M.A.D Level:.... 1  MUSIC:.....Heff swearing at his game FELOID:....sleeping outside the spare-bedroom door.  BUNBUN:.....thrashing 'round in coffin in spare room.   *yawns*  I'm knackered.  Lots of stuff bin happnin - most of it good.  Not all of it, though: Hon, when you read this, I hope you're feeling really much better - that they've sorted everything out and you can keep the cuppasoup down, now.  I'm sending you lots of "love", "healthy" and "energy" waves; plus some "shout at the useless fucking doctors" ones - just in case you're getting low on those.  I'm finking of ya - drop me a mail when you can.  So....good fings....hmmmmm...oh  YES ....  Heff, bless his little (odd, holey) cotton sox, has been UTTERLY INSUFFERABLE since Monday - when they sent back the remaining bits for his flat-pack PC. It now appears to be working - he spent all day yesterday hitting it with stuff (I think?) and now it's pretty-much doing as it's told - and he is about as smug as a very smug indeed thing that's opened a big box of smug he got this morning and has just heard there's more smug on the way.  Have you ever heard the phrase 'dog with two dicks'?  Well, that's Heff at the moment.   It's a "Heff-with-two-dicks" - as if the one he's got doesn't swell his head (no pun intended) sufficiently as it is.  He's spending quite a lot of time humming to himself and smiling; bouncing around; being accommodating and cheerful; unexpectedly giving me kisses  for no reason  and asking me if I know how much he loves me.  (It's okay: you don't have to scrabble for the sick-bag. He's only saying that coz I let him have the space on my credit card that meant he didn't have to save up....)  It's kinda scary, actually....I'm not sure that I don't prefer him miserable, on the whole.   Especially since I noticed, now that we can sit opposite one another and play on our respective machines, that when he's immersed in a game, he looks like a kid with 'special needs' who's concentrating really hard on a particularly tricky sum.  Still, it's better'n his 'telly-watching' face: he looks like a geeky-leptoid who's had some kinda near-terminal cerebral episode!!  On the up-side: he's  very  amenable and much less grumpy; and Hamlet is back, almost, to pre-Ipswich days.  S'pose I'll just have to get used to the new 'Happy Heff'.....*sigh*...bleugh...  *grinz eevylly*  Nick coming 'round on Sat was a blast: they et sugar, beer was drunk, pointless boy humour was perpetrated, and Nick had had his usual copious amount of tears dripping off the end of his nose.    I swear: next time they're both gunna be in the same room as beer, sweeties - and each other, I'm goin' out!!  It gets very manic around here - and I haven't a clue what's so hilarious: I suspect I'm about 20 years too old and entirely the wrong gender to get it.  It was cool to see Nick and have an actual conversation with someone who wasn't Heff - such as it was, between the sugar, the beer, the tears and his fur allergy.  Oh and food happened - eventually.  Heff was cooking. He's really good when he pays attention to what he's doing; but he did his usual: asked me to 'help', then, whatever I suggested he either ignored it or bit my head off.  Heff is NOT good when he's hungry....especially once the sugar wears off and he's crashing!!  (teeheehee!!)  Still, it was cool of Nick to come. Don't have enough people visiting us - s'pose that's the trouble with moving further out of town: everyone I know either lives on the other side of the river or just can't be arsed to come all this way to see us.  Other things happened.....oh yeah.   Eoin is settling in okay. I cleaned his coffin out this morning and, as soon as I'd turned my back, he filled it full of turd and kicked all the litter all over it.   It appears that he's an accolyte of the Heff school of home-maintenance, so I can see we're going to Have Words.  It also turns out that he's worse than George for getting under your feet - and at least you KNOW when you're treading on George, coz he makes a noise.   Eoin just sits there being rather pathetically crushed in silence, while I carry on blissfully unaware - until my brane gains enough of my attention to suggest that, really, the lump under my slipper is a bit too large for even  Heff  to have missed with the hoover; and, also, should it really be squirming like that?  Eoin loves the bathroom best: charges around like a small fluffy dervish, skidding on the lino and trying to eat the bathmats.  Having been forewarned by Gran, I've also provided him with the mohair jumper I washed on 70 by accident - so he also has something to shag.  Well, why should one not indulge the fetishes of one's pets?   And, better he shag my old jumper than the one I'm currently  wearing ...*stares hard at George*  Despite my worst fears, and his best efforts, George has, to date, managed totally to fail to eat Eoin.   He's a bit pissed to discover that the 'rabbit  thing  ' has it's own impregnable castle of plastic and metal, from which George has, thus far, been completely unable to extract him.  Now that I leave the bedroom door open - I want him to get used to the idea of bunny-boy and his coffin in the spare room - George just sits and watches him from the stairs. You can tell he's majorly bummed and frustrated by all the iron-mongery: but he's trying not to show it - to me, anyway.   He wants to lull me into a false sense of security, so I'll let bun-boy out of his fortress - thereby rendering him accessible  hors d'euvre .  I am sure there is dark malevolence in his soul; but I'm hoping he's lived with me for long enough to know that he'll get more than a clip round the ear if he's caught eating the guests again. (Sorry Garry!! You don't really  need  all those toes, anyway!!)   In other news, I bought a chair from a charity shop on Sat. It is a rather forlorn example of 19th century English oak vernacular craftsmanship: the wood could do with a bit of TLC; and it needs a new stretcher and the leather's hammered, so it's gotta be re-covered; but the upholstry innards are basically okay.  It's gunna be a nice piece of kit, when it's done; and I thought it was a total barg at £8.  However, when M&D came over to take me to pick it up today. it turns out that my idiot parent (f) thought I'd paid  £80  for it!!   I  thought  she was a bit tight-lipped on the phone on Sunday...but, honestly. Her faith in my ability to manage my finances sensibly is just so touching: like, even if I  HAD  £80, I'd spend it on a fucking   chair  ??!!.  It's noticeable how supportive and positive she is at the moment: the words 'miserable, wet, sodding and blanket' spring irrepressibly to mind. If her lips get any tighter, they'll stay like that: and she'll look like she has an asshole let into the front of her face - PERMANENTLY     Nice to know I am so well-thought-of in the bosom of my family, eh?  On the other side of the genetic divide, Gran has come up with yet another lunatic plan: she's gonna get rid of all her stuff, sell her shares, put all her money into annuities, and move back into the care home - permanently.  She's off her fucking rocker....but hell, nothing any of us can do about it.  I grilled her for half an hour the other night to make sure she's getting - and listening to - independent financial advice....that's about all I can do.  D is the only one she'd listen to - and he's up to his arse in mud, pain and cat-litter at the moment, so no hope there.  Still, at least it will get rid of all her money in one go; put a stop to the disgusting attempts at manipulation that happened while she was in hospital. Once  they  realise  they  can't get money out of her anymore, no doubt  they  will lose interest in her completely - and fucking good thing too.  Happy thing is that it looks like the "We'ain" will be joining us in Giraffe's-ville sooner than I hoped. Fings are, of course, set to kick off with the shitty boot - what with the mad Blonde and all; but it will be so majorly, majorly cool to have her here that I am quite happy repeatedly to thump whoever pisses the wee darlin' about, until they see the error of their way - or end up in casualty: whichever is bloodier.   I think this is a splendid idea: keep both of the perverts -  and  the blonde, possibly - occupied; and hopefully cut down on the gloom factor - and the gnomic scribblings perpertrated by the large pagan one, too! (Note??)  So I will keep the peace and make this work by force, if necessary.   I have also decided, after some debate with myself, that it would be a cunning wheeze to have a party at the end of May/start of June.   Yanno, kinda "celebrate-getting-even-older-any-excuse-to-get-wasted-getting-people-together-so-all-my-mates-can-see-how-weird-all-my-other-mates-are" kinda bash.  I'm toying with the idea of making it giraffe-themed; it was 'jungle animals'; but I kinda want people to dress up...  I must have developed a more refined species of masochism than I'd realised, heretofore: it took six months to get the house straight after the LAST one.  But still....I'll have the Scary Organizer of d00m working on it this time.,..tho the whole thing willl, of course, depend on persuading people that they really DO want to come and hang in Ips for a bit.   So I am going to have to do some research and see who might be up for it.  (Thus, if you're reading this, I might vaguely know who you are, and you reckon you might be open for a spot ogf low-grade debauchery around the end of May, mail me and save me the effort and embarassment of actually having to invite you, will you?  I mean... [annoying grrly voice] "...do you want to come to my party...?" [/annoying grrly voice]...it's just so NAFF, innit?  NB. The idea is that floor-space will be available at various locations other than my gaff; so 'crash where you fall' won't be the only option.  There might even be the odd matress available...(though, if it's been associated with either Nick, Heather or Heff, it will probably be very odd indeed....)   Oh, and a word to the wise??   This  year, I will not be interrupted, mid-shag, and made to move from my  own bed  into the spare room, okay?  Though, Heff can still sleep curled up on the landing outside my door all night - if he's planning on making it, like, a family tradition, and stuff.  Well that's all I can be arsed to think of. There's more: but it's equally boring; so I won't bother.  Oh, I'm getting my labret done as soon as I can organise me, Nick-the-piercer, an appropriately-sized blackline bcr, and the requisite amount of cash into the same place at once.  I bin wanting to do it for about 18 months and I'm not putting it off any longer. If the dermatology thing happens...well, tough.  Plus, it will really piss off my mother; but she thinks I'm a dropkick anyway, so what's the point in stressin??  I'm going to eat Japanese rice crackers and watch a film, now.  Hang loose, all you weird little dudes, who read my blog, out there....!!?  .~*~.

      .~*~.  MOOD:.... sleepy - it's 8.26 am  M.A.D Level:.... Don't go there! (Tho it's more hysteria than insanity)  MUSIC:.... silence - no-one's up yet FELOID:....sulking an' refusing to eat his tuna - coz of Eoin.    Sit down and take a deep breath, for I have  strange  and  wondrous   news to impart.  Last night, between 7pm and 11.30pm, having had the fight of the day already, Heff and I......  cleaned the house  !  *gasps and wheezes in shock and clutches the furniture for support*  Yup.  The slut-pit is no more. (Well, for the time being, anyway)  And I don't mean just kinda tidied up a bit: I mean   CLEAN  !  I even did almost all of the filing.  I know: it's  extraordinary , isn't it?  "So, what happened?" I hear you cry. "Surely this miraculous circumstance came not simply from out of the blue?"  Well, No.   We  were  going to go down the pub last night; then D - my landlord and complicated consanguinity of relation - phoned. He's in the TA and currently being put through basic training (it was his first week. You could tell by the fact that he could scarcely move and had to be propped up in a wing chair while he et his kebab, coz he's in agony from the 20 mile run he had to do - with 40 lb of kit on). So, seeing as how they've half-killed him already, he decided to bring all the decorating stuff, and Eoin, up to ours before they finish the job (and while his muscles are still mobile enough for him to drive).  He also announced that he would like to crash here, as he was on his way up to Manchester to see his GF tomorrow.  Heff and I weren't on speakers at the time; but I got off the phone, looked at him, and announced the great happening.  He grasped the situation immediately. (He's a smart boy)   We exchanged a long look of petrification and ill-disguised horror.   We looked around us, taking in the full hideousness of our surroundings.  Panic rose like a phantom shipwreck - all oogy, covered in seaweed, barnacles and scary looking sea-creatures with strange, feelery-type protusions and lots of teeth.  So cleaning happened - LOTS of it: furniture was moved, piles of junk were sorted; stuff was put away, boxes were emptied, cupboards were organised; beds were made; floors got mopped, hoovering happened. Some stuff even got polished! And the shed is now full of binbags (the dustmen having totally failed to empty the bins - either of 'em - for three weeks now).  Heffy did a certain amount of staggering around looking confused: not coz of the shock of cleaning (tho I doubt that helped); but coz the cat ambushed him on the stairs, he flailed, and managed to brain himself on the bannisters.   Was he down-hearted?   Well, yes, actually.   But, keenly alert to the urgency of the situation, he struggled on Heff-fully.  It's amazing what you can achieve with the proper motivation, isn't it?  Inevitably - despite my directions - D arrived: with a car literally full-to-bursting-point of, oooh, at least 5 tins of paint; and Eoin.  Ah yes: Eoin.  You pronnounce it 'Owen'; but he's an Irish Rabbit, so he insists on the authentic spelling.  He comes in a cage the size of a medium-sized coffin, that looks like a giant litter tray with a wire box on the top - from which, I am given to understand, he can escape quite easily if feeling determined enough.   Eoin is black and white, and unecessarily fluffy; with bizarre long, floppy ears that make him look like he got caught in the rain and they wilted. He's  some kind of dwarf-miniature species I didn't catch the name of -  but he's actually a house-rabbit; which means (as far as I can tell) that he gets to poo on the carpet without ending up in a pie. He  does  have a litter tray, which is designed to prevent this - as he is allegedly house-trained, thus technically aware of its function.   However, Gran had him at Christmas, so I have  Heard All About Eoin  and am  Well Prepared .   Mostly for Heff skidding around on fresh rabbit-turd; George leaving home; and Eoin chewing stuff.   Eoin is easily bored, it seems, and tends to nibble things - carpet, electric cables, furniture, curtains, duvet covers, cushions, plastic bags - when he is at a loss for anything else to do.   So it's a trip to the pet-shop today - I'm buying him toys: LOTS of toys; coz if he eats my red velvet curtains, it's rabbit-pie time and hang the tenancy agreement. Plus, as he comes without food (coz D forgot it) I'm gunna have to get some of that, too.   Interesting....I never had to look after a rabbit before: I looked after my friend Lizzie's pet hamster once while she was in Ibiza; but it died.  Things are looking a bit desperately bleak for Eoin, then, aren't they?  So,  why  have we suddenly aquired an incontinent Irish dwarf-miniature house-rabbit with an oral fixation?   Believe it or not, it's written into our tenancy agreement on the house: " The Tenants agree, given adequate notice, to look after the Landlords's rabbit when The Landlord is away... ."  Unfortunately, along with the undertaking  "... not to eat said rabbit, or use him in any ritual or unnatural practices ..."; which we have signed, so we can't - unless we wanna be evicted.  So as D is in training for an all-expenses-paid-by-HM-Forces extended 'trip' to Iraq, and is unlikely to return from said godforsaken war-zone 'till December (possibly sooner: but obviously, unfortunately, inna pine box - though I hope not, as we'll end up homeless with a geriatric cat  and  an incontinent rabbit to support), we're  in loco parentis  to Eoin til then.  How's George taking this new addition to the family?  Pretty well, actually - for George, that is.  We introduced them last night: Eoin on the sofa with Heff; George cowering, in a horrified and deeply suspicious fashion, under the coffee table, with his eyes on stalks.  His every movement and expression said "what the  fuck  is  THAT  and what's it doing in   MY   house?".  Periodically, he turned his attention to Heff, fixing him with a glare that spoke eloquently of his sense of betrayal at seeing his Daddy consorting freely with the interloper.   On the up side, He only actually tried to  kill  Eoin twice.   And that was in the  whole half hour   Eoin was on the sofa!!   (Scaring the hell out of Heff.)   (Eoin likes to bounce about and make unusual noises; Heff is unused to this and tended to jump, cringe and flail quite a lot every time Eoin bounced, thumped or squeaked.).  George cheered up a bit when he realised the "Terrible  rabbit   Thing" had gone; but I don't think he's figured out - yet - that Eoin and his coffin are actually still on the premises - currently, lurking in the book-room.  I suspect that Eoin is going to be spending quite a lot of time - for a house-rabbit - in his cage, confined to the spare room entirely for his own security and protection. Once we get the door fixed so it will stay shut and George-proof, that is.  Rabbit pie is one thing; but rabbit-guts all over the house, and a bunny-gore-encrusted George in solitary, on bread-and-water for a month, is  quite  another...   PS. I have now posted the second part of  The Guide to Chainsaw-Bondage  ("Hints and Tips") and updated it - for your edification.  Still no sign of Special Branch ...."Home Made Napalm for Beginners"  and " How to Make Your Own Explosives From Everyday Things You Can Find in Your Kitchen"  coming soon....   .~*~.

      .~*~.  Uh....I suspect this is gunna be one of those "... it amuses  ME ; but ..." posts....  WARNING: if you're squeamish, sensitive or prone to failing to spot vast tracts of morbidly ironic humour, it's probably best if you look away now...  (I was bored yesterday. VERY bored. And I've bin in a funny mood for a couple of days - ok?)    Slasha’s Guide To Chainsaw-Bondage Fun.    This is my personal method - refined over many years of practice and experience. It's not a definitive guide, obviously; but it covers most of the key requirement; and a highlights a few of the major pitfalls and mistakes often made by beginners.  Luckily, I've never had a chainsaw-bondage scene go badly wrong - well, I'm writing this from my own house; so that should prove something ; but I have had a few little mistakes and niggles before – everybody does. Don't worry about this - especially if you're a beginner: mistakes are how we learn; and you will always have another opportunity to iron out those little kinks in your technique, and small gaps in your knowledge.  Anyway - here we go!  You will need:  * 1. A basement or secret room. (well soundproofed) * 2. Approx. 60m of industrial-grade polythene sheeting (dependent on size of * 1.) * 3. Quite a lot of  strong adhesive (Of a kind suitable for attaching * 2. securely to every surface of * 1) see also: 'hints and tips' section, below. * 4. Some chain, cuffs, shackles, rope, cable, washing-line, or similar - according to context, location and preference.  * 5. An efficient, well-constructed gag (optional). * 6. An A-frame, bench, table, chair - depending on preference, method and budget. Must be of very sturdy construction and, obviously, easily dismantlable for disposal. * 7. A chainsaw, or variety thereof. Petrol or compressed gas examples are generally preferable, as they allow for greater free movement and flexibility in operation. NB. Please, PLEASE: DON'T use your favourite or most valuable chainsaw - or one that someone else is expecting you to return! Remember: you have to dispose of everything - and that means everything!! * 8. A full-body, kevlar-lined, boiler-suit with hood, made of lightweight, flexible, waterproof material.  * 9. A pair of tough construction-worker's boots (Doesn't matter who the tough construction worker is; just make sure he has roughly the same size feet as you do.) * 10. A large packet of J-cloths (or similar) * 11. A sturdy yard-broom. * 12. A dustpan-and-brush * 13. A large bucket, of the kind found on construction sites (see * 8.) * 14. A long-handled mop and appropriate mop-bucket. * 15. A selection of scalpels and kitchen knives, according to taste, method and technique. NB.Essential:   ~ 4 scalpel blades + stainless steel handle (may use disposables if preferred)  ~ a heavy meat-cleaver  ~ a large cook's knife  ~ a fish-scaling knife  ~ a good-quality, strong, yet flexible, filleting-knife. * 15. A blow-torch, oxy-acetaline torch, or similar.  * 16. Several large rubble sacks (min. = 6) + a selection of smaller carrier-bags, freezer/sandwich bags and rubbish-bags (for preference, use the variety most commonly employed in your area - and therefore most inconspicuous.)  * 17. 3-4 rolls of duct-tape, heavy insulating tape, or similar. NB. Must be water-proof. * 18. Access to a reasonaby plentiful supply of both hot and cold water. (Remember: hot water sets the protiens in blood and can therefore cause stubborn staining!)  * 19  1 bottle industrial-strength cleaning-fluid (min. 1 litre); of the kind employed in catering establishments.  * 20. 1 complete set of clean clothing, inc. sturdy footwear. (This to be left in a sealed bag, just outside door of venue, at all times - until required.) * 21. A large, spacious and - above all - reliable vehicle (eg; estate car (station-wagon), Jeep, Landrover, small commercial vehicle)  NB. This is critical; so an old FIAT Panda (or similar)  you bought off some bloke in a pub for £70 will not do!!  It will not be big enough; and you can't be 100% certain that it won’t break down or develop some defect that will put you at risk of being stpooed by the police. * 22. A wheeled trolley of the variety designed for moving heavy containers/bags. NB. Should be suitable for moving irregularly-shaped and unstable loads) * 23. A detailed map of your county/state/region/country, of the kind that details both commercial and private waste-disposal sites; and that indicates larger stretches of disused land, and areas of forest, woodland and heavy vegetation. * 24. A large electric lantern or torch + good supply of fuel for same (eg. batteries, kerosene, etc.)  * 25. A good digging spade - as a disposal contingency.  You should keep with it a small supply of clean water (min. 5litres), soap, cloths, paper towels. Also, a tool suitable for boot-scraping and a small scrubbing-brush are advisable; although, obviously, disposable boot-covers are preferable. (NB In this eventuality, a sledge-hammer - at least a 5lb one - is also likely to be useful to you. Better to have one than waste time, and valuable energy, looking for a suitable rock!) * 26 An alibi.  This should be as convincing, detailed, verifiable and unshakeable-under-cross-examination as possible. No matter what you may think now, yyou may think now, you WON'T be able to just-make-it-up-as-you-go-along-if-you-need-to. Certainly not with anything like enough sincerity and authenticity to convice a Scotland Yard murder-squad detective (of more than five minutes experience) - let alone a High Court Judge!! * 27. A VERY good lawyer (+ quite a lot of money) (just in case!)  ~*~*~*~   So....  Having listed the essential requirements for your adventure, I'm sure the method is self-evident enough not to require detailed explanation. I am also wary of being too prescriptive: this is the time to let your own preferences, imagination and inventiveness guide you!  However, I would offer a couple of helpful hints and reminders - just to cheer you along:  DO make sure your 'subject' is not going to be missed for some time - preferably days; though weeks or months are better.  DON'T be tempted to skimp on the kevlar. An unplanned chainsaw injury, inflicted accidentally on the wrong 'subject', can negate all your careful planning; and seriously hamper your enjoyment of the 'scene'.  DO throughly sound-proof your venue - especially if it is situated in a residential area; and if you plan to extend your 'scene' over a prolonged time-span - eg. more than 24 hours or so.  DON'T forget use your imagination! This is YOUR scene - you can do anything you can come up with: the sky's the limit!  DON'T forget to make sure you securely line, with polythene and tape, the interior of your vehicle AS WELL as your 'playroom'. Remember: forensic teams can collect body fluids from a vehicle JUST as easily as from a room!   Do be prepared for unexpected contingencies. Many 'subjects' have unpredictable reactions when experiencing Chainsaw-Bondage for the first time - emotional, mental AND physical. You'd be surprised how easily a scene can be spoilt by a struggling, over-passive, too-silent or very noisy 'subject'; or that large shard of bone flying out just a little harder than you expected that peirces your carefully secured polythene. Always think through what you would do in such circumstances and have a few extra toys, props and tools to hand - just in case you need to 'liven up' or 'cool down' your chainsaw fun.  DON'T forget to dispose of all your clothing, implements, soiled sheeting, rolls of left-over tape, rope etc. JUST as carefully as you do everything else. How many people have been tripped up because they forgot that bits of tape can be matched; or because they just couldn't bear to part with their favourite cleaver!! Think of the embarassment!    DO plan disposal so that you don't have too many 'items' left in a single place. Obviously, the more there is to find, the higher the likelihood that someone will find it.   DON'T - under any circumstances whatsoever, be tempted to record, in any way, shape or form, even the smallest part of your chainsaw-bondage fun. It's natural to want to preserve such special moments for posterity; and to have the opportunity of experiencing them over and over again - without having to go to all that trouble and expense again quite so soon. But remember: tapes, cd's, pictures, videos, and so forth, can turn a routine police inquiry into a full-scale serial-murder investigation almost instantly. In addition. they may make any kind of successful defence strategy very difficult for your legal team to devise. (the same is true for souvenirs of the ‘scene’: don’t be tempted to keep anything: it’s stupid.)  Finally: Do enjoy your chainsaw-bondage experience!   It's a very challenging ‘scene’ to plan, organise and comm...er...execu....um...do; and it can be both tiring and dangerous if you aren't 100% competent, meticulous and completely focussed in your approach.    However, nothing is quite as exhilarating, moving and - yes, dammit! - stunningly beautiful as a properly-planned chainsaw-bondage scene, carried out by a well-trained, talented, highly skilled and imaginitive psychopathic pervert.   And remember: if anything DOES go wrong, it's not the end of the world!  Finding yourself in Broodmoor/on Death Row will give you all the time you need finally to get around to that Law degree you've been promising yourself for years!  So - take the plunge - go on! You know you want to: and it will be well worth the trouble in the end!

      .~*~.   MOOD:.... *bounce* M.A.D Level:.... low  MUSIC:....dinner bubbling on the hob  FELOID:....Crashed out in his new cupboard.   Well....  Had a long talk with Heff last night - sorted out a LOT of stuff.  He's having couple-anxiety.   I remember that.  Not much we can do about it other than keep talking. Or, in his case, talk.  We realised forcefully in the course of the conversation that we really don't know each other as well as we think we do: we've been seeing each other for 9 months; and living together for 7 of those; but because of all the shite, haven't had a lot of space for deep and meaningfuls, or the attention most people get to pay their new relationships.   We tend to forget this and assume: leads to both of us spending too much time second-guessing the other - and often getting it wrong.  This is gonna be fixed.  Dunno what else is gunna get fixed straight away; but I think we both have a clearer idea of what might need more than a second glance and a fleeting thought.  So things have gone from okayish-to-insecure to massively good. If I didn't love the little sod so much it would be easy: as I do, it's not.  Then again, when is anything easy?  I managed to drop not one, but   two  faux pas  in the space of 24 hours. Heard from someone I like a lot but who I haven't been in touch with for ages last week - yanno, just a one-liner out of the blue. I replied then....silence.   So, Yesterday - bored - I dropped him a fatuous 'why mail me if you then fuck off' mail. He replied pretty shortly, in a way that looked like - well, to "no-attention-span-dickbrane" here anyway - he had split from his partner.   Talk about eyeball bulge: not only was I shocked as fuck, I felt a right insensitive twat about mailing him mindless drivel in the midst of his trauma.   So, of course, I stopped to consider my response carefully, lest I cause  further  offence....yeah, like   FUCK  : I mailed him straight back, in a state of shock, embarassment and panic - sorta saying 'dude, if you need anything...er...I dunno what to say' - coz, not having thought about it....I didn't.   Predictably, I then recieve a further mail saying that they HADN'T split. It was rather terse in tone. I think he thought I was either prying, stupid for not knowing; or angling for gory details.  Heff told me a couple of hours ago that he'd had mail from the guy's partner (they don't get on very well, it seems): she thought it was him mailing from my account.   So that's both feet, then.   o joy.  Top mate, me.  Though I'm relieved I'd only got the wrong end of the stick - they always seemed so solid to me: sort of a beacon of hope in a churning sea of 'alternative relationship' delusion and crapfulness.    Thus, I have resolved to keep my gob shut 'til my brain's kick-started itself into (it's best impression of) activity, in future.  Yeah, right...  *sigh*  My oldest friend Garry phoned me tonight, too - the traditional annual phonecall; but this time I am determined to stay in touch with him.   Funny, I bin thinking about him a lot, lately.  He's psychic.  Plus, he has my phone number, whereas my phone is a mass of confusion;  and in light of recent fuckups....  The last time we spoke, he was just about to get married and I was just about to go mad; and that was kinda that.    I miss him, though: he's been there for me through pretty much  every major (and quite a lot of the minor) traumas in my life - up until I started seeing Noel, that is.   He was right about that, too - bastard knows me FAR too well! P'raps it's about time I started listening to him - yanno, occasionally, like. Just to keep him on his toes.  It's just  so  good to see him finally find someone worthy of him, and who loves him as much as he deserves. I really  rate  Vhari - we just instantly clicked. They have some pretty tough things to deal with at the moment; but it sounds like they're really happy and settled together.  Garry is just the same: was telling me about his exploits as a perv-nearly-in-disguise; and he  howled  when I told him about Heff. I won't share what he called me - just refer you to the previous answer about him knowing me far too well. *grinz*  I just cooked dinner - it's only 1.34 am - so I better go and eat it. Therapy at 10.30 tomorrow - hahahahahaaaa! Every time I say or write the word "Therapy", I feel like I should be appending a question-mark and preparing to pootle off to a rock gig...  My brane is odd.  erk...  Best go eat then.  I will get round to the sewage thing soon.  Misery loves company: and I'm good at highly evocative imagery, so it would be a pity to waste the incident.  Just make sure you're not eating, 'kay?   (Well, no one  forces  you to read this shite....)  .~*~.

        Paranoia, paranoia, la, la, la-la, la....      Ahhh, I'm so lucky.  Look around you - look at what some poor, deluded, fuckwits put up with.  it's so nice to be valued and appreciated by someone you love and trust.   It's just  great  when someone naturally puts you first - above any other random tottie they may come across; and expresses their love, affection, respect and appreciation of you openly, at every opportunity, to everyone they come across.  It's so nice to see modest contentment and happiness radiating from the one you love - in public - and knowing that everyone knows that, in large part, it is because of you.  Not to mention the pleasure of seeing a fair and honest representation of your life together - warts and all; but roses as well as warts - portrayed with affectionate balance; and to know that every time your name is mentioned, you can be sure of some affectionate comment or demonstration of appreciation and esteem from your - equally perfect - beloved.  It's such a source of security and comfort to know that your trust, respect and affection is so well placed in a person who  really  cares about you, and who's primary concern is your feelings and that you are seen by others in a  fair - if positive - light. It's nice to know that your life-partner is happy and secure enough, and totally commited, to the extent that they're only interested in presenting themselves in their true colours. Rather than the usual, tiresome but wearyingly predictable, desire to spin everything to try and impress strangers (and people who could turn out to be cute and who they might like to flirt with later).   It's all about loyalty, respect and sensitivity, in the end.   I love that my SO would do nothing whatsoever to make anyone doubt that he is attached, unavailable, monogamous - and really  happy  about it. I have the comfort of knowing that he always makes clear to people, from the start, that there are strict lines and limits he has set himself. It's just so cool to know that he's totally loyal; and won't moan about me or our relationship unfairly, to people who don't even know me.  I can totally trust him never to suggest, by omission or implication, that he's not  quite  happy in his relationship; or that he's bravely enduring the shitty end of the stick because he's such a great person; or that, therefore, what other people may see as crossing the boundary of intimacy is just harmless flirting - never with the intention of suggesting that, were he not so terribly under the thumb, he'd love there to end up being more to it.  I mean, there's nothing worse than being the only person not privy to the innermost thoughts and feelings, and random quibbles and discontentmennts, of the one you love.  God forbid that it's also stuff they'll happily wheel out in public, for any Tamara, Denise or Harriet that happens to be passing, instead: discussing your shortcomings, as if you're some kind of persecuting harridan, behind your back - just for the sympathy vote; and so everyone (young and female) thinks (or better, tells him) how stupid/great he is for putting up with it (and, he hopes, nightly fantasises about how she'll be there to 'comfort' him when he finally has enough/sees sense and leaves the Old Bag).  There  is  nothing worse than that, is there?   Oh yeah...except for being damned with faint praise and, obviously to all, added as a dutiful afterthought in passing - if the thought happens to occur at the time.  I'm so lucky I'm with someone   so    commited, loyal, sensitive and concerned for my feelings that I don't have   any  of that....  Christ, anyone with even the smallest  particle  of self-respect and dignity  whatsoever   would realise it was a pointless relationship, if their SO thought  that  little of them, wouldn't they?  I mean, only a   really   stupid twat wouldn't get that - right?  *sigh*  On a lighter note, I'll tell you about the sewage incident tomorrow....

      .~*~.  MOOD:.... Up and down like a pair of tart's knickers  M.A.D Level:.... ??? MUSIC:....System of a Down ~ Toxicity  FELOID:....Climbing all over me meeping coz he wants a cuddle.  Yeah, well.  Bin an odd kinda week - not sure quite how I feel or how to react.  On the one hand, I've probably achieved more this week than I have for months; some stuff that's been dragging on for aeons (Ians ^_^) is getting sorted; and my brain seems to be functioning a bit better.  On the other hand, I'm all over the place: my mood seems to change almost minute by minute in a kinda psycho way.  One minute I'm maniacally up; the next I'm suicidal. It levels out at a kinda broodingly pessimistic level - not happy but able to function.  But when I stop and look at my current achievements, they are so little: I've accomplished in a week what would usually have taken me a day in the past.   This is possibly why the euphoria of finally being able to DO things is somewhat shortlived.  I'm also having problems with other people's reactions. Maybe it's a new development; maybe I only just noticed it; or maybe I'm being paranoid; but the last couple of days has highlighted the extent to which those close to me have the tendency to treat me like a stupid child.  I'm not ungrateful; but I have more than enough actual,  real  problems, without others inventing more for me.  I know it's not from any lack of love, or desire to support me; but I'm getting really negative vibes: people either dictate to me what I should do (like I can't figure it out on my own), nag me about stuff (like I'm not going to do it), or adopt a negative "there's no point - you know you'll never do it, so what's the point in trying?" attitude.  Not only is this unhelpful in that it makes me feel even worse about myself and my abilities, it makes it even less likely that I will be able actually to  achieve  whatever it is they're going on about. So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; and the whole cycle begins again.  I know I've been pretty uselessly non-functional for quite a while now; but I think I'm getting better. Some things are becoming much easier; though some things are still problematic and there's lots I can't handle yet. Nonetheless, I'm becoming a much more capable person again - closer every day to feeling like my real self.  It's not just my perception, either: it's been remarked upon - mostly by these same people. But they don't seem able to translate their acknowledgement of my improvement into any kind of concrete support or encouragement.  I find this very undermining and discouraging.  I know I shouldn't - especially since we seem to be very firmly in the 'two steps forward, one step backwards' cycle; but it disappoints me that the people closest to me, those who supposedly care about me the most, seem intent on making it harder for me to progress by focussing on the negative to the exclusion of all else.  I'm not a four year old; I'm not irresponsible or lazy; I'm not an idiot. I'm just ill.    I'm trying to make decisions for myself, based on what I see as realistic achievements, and plans that I see as positive. Even if I don't achieve all of my short-term - or even daily - goals, I  am  achieving some of them.    Why, then, do people only focus on my weaknesses and failures, what  doesn't  get done?  Why does the reaction to anything I plan that I share with them seem to be a wearied, indulgent smile, a metaphorical condescending pat on the head and patronising discouragement? Isn't it a positive development that I can plan and achieve   something  ? Don't I deserve some acknowledgement of what I can, and have, done - rather than being constantly reminded of, and criticised for, what I can't or haven't?  All the time I've been really ill, I've had to deal with people not understanding (fair enough) what's going on in my head, expecting me to be able to do things I simply can't, and taking my crapfulness either personally or as evidence of some moral degeneracy: a feeble, conscious, lack of will or effort; or just a careless lack of commitment on my part. I know that to some exent, people think I could do more, be better, choose not to be so hopeless, could help what's happening.   The psychological fallout from this has been dealing with constant guilt, feelings of inadequacy and obligation, and an almost enforced sense of helplessness and dependence. I've had to try to fight against internalising this view of others - of me as 'mad', 'hopeless', 'incapable', 'untrustworthy', 'unreliable'. The thing that has enabled me to cope and progress is projecting this external image on the 'illness'; keeping a strong picture of who I REALLY am in my head as an objective and telling myself that, one day, I will be able to make it through the fog of this 'stuff' in my head to become myself again.    But other people seem to have replaced the picture of the 'real' me with one of this other, lesser, person. I can understand this - it's fair enough: but I hoped that signs of some recovery would herald a gradual return of the way I was seen before. However, having not understood the dynamics of 'ill claire', it seems that now, as I am improving and becoming more 'myself', they don't get that either.  Okay, so some people didn't know me before I got ill. Even so, some of the reflexive reactions I am getting make me fear that even  normal  evolution and development, of the kind that  every  person experiences through time, would be very difficult to achieve within the relationships I have with particular people.  It's difficult. I used to - and still do - feel intense guilt and frustration at my inability to do certain things with and for people. Now I'm becoming increasingly angry at the low expectations of others. In a lot of ways, it appears people have forgotten that, underneath the crapfullness, I still have the same personality, beliefs, morals, codes of behaviour and ideals that I always did. Fair enough if people think, in the privacy of their own heads, that I'm incapable and need to be dictated to and 'managed'; but their seeming need to share it with me, and to discourage and undermine my progress as a result, is killing me.  I don't  need  anyone to tell me that I'm a flake: I know this already. I don't need to have  all  my inconsistencies, past failures and inabilities constantly pointed out to me: I am painfully aware of them all.  I don't even particularly need endless encouragement and support: just for people not to barrack, patronise and prevent me from making decisions for myself and gradually taking back control of my own life.  Is it too much to ask that, if they can't show any trust, or have any faith, people will at least listen, and allow me to get on with stuff it in my own way, without thinking they know best and, as a result, constantly denying me the chance even to try?  Talking to Meg about things this week made me realise how hard it is for people who haven't experienced this form of depression to understand what it does.   It might seem to them that they are helping; certainly, I know that in most cases this is their intention; but why is it so hard for them to accept that the most helpful thing they can really do is listen to what I say I need.   It's NOT supportive to try and completely take over, and to try to run or dictate every aspect of my life. It isn't helpful to take away every little decision from me; nor to disagree with and undermine every plan I make, every system I instigate, every objective I state.  Is it unreasonable for people who really want to help to listen to me and accept that what I   say   I need  IS  what I  actually  need from them, and respect that?   It would be nice to feel able to  discuss  stuff with people, without tham seeing this as confusion, indecision or the necessity for them to wade in and 'sort it out' for me.  Like I say: I'm not an idiot. You DON'T know what's best for me.   And, as everyone else is allowed to make their own mistakes, and have their own small failures, without having them constantly shoved down their throat, used as evidence of their general inability, and as a stick with which to beat them - why not me?  Apart from anything else, I look at the way some of these 'helpful and concerned' folks who seek to criticise and dictate to me "run" (or not) their own lives, and the word  hypocricy  springs irrepressibly to mind. Perhaps they excuse themselves from sorting out their own mess because of the time they like to think it takes them to "have to" sort out mine.  When everyone else is perfect, reliable and achieves everything they set out to do every day; when others are organised, self-disciplined, consistant, never put off or neglect any responsibility and never fail,  THEN  they can treat me like a useless moron, entitled to no say in the running her own life.  Until then, I'm honestly of the opinion that it would be better if they left me alone, to muddle through as best I can by myself; especially if the only alternative is to have them standing at the barricades hurling rocks - then trying to tell me that a cracked skull is what's best for me.  .~*~.

      .    Quiz Time...     Books first:        You're  A Prayer for Owen Meany !   by John Irving     Despite humble and perhaps literally small beginnings, you inspire faith in almost everyone you know. You are an agent of higher powers, and you manifest this fact in mysterious and loud ways. A sense of destiny pervades your every waking moment, and you prepare with great detail for destiny fulfilled. When you speak, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS!      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .       WOW!!!!         Yours are  DEMON  wings, possibly resembling those of a bat - huge, black, and clawed. You are cold and impure, and a born Creature of the Night. Possibly with an interest in those of a vampyric nature, or possibly one yourself. You have little sympathy or care for humanity and see them as existing for no real purpose - thus, you can be very manipulative and bend them to fit YOUR purpose. And you do have a purpose, to everything you do. Nine times out of ten it will be strictly for your own self gratification or perhaps merely amusement. As soon as a person or situation is no longer productive or pleasurable in your life, you will rid yourself of it or them. You could very well have just a touch of superiority complex (or perhaps more than a touch?). Despite all of this, you are capable of love so intense that you place that person's wishes even above your own - the only time that you will do so. Chances are you are attracted to people in which you see...yourself.

                                              .~*~.    Ha HA!!!!    (as Pooh and Piglet would say)    MOOD :.... Maniacal (inna  gooood  way) *grinz eevylly*  M.A.D Level :.... 3   MUSIC :....Fear Factory ~ Digimortal / Echobelly ~ "Lustral" ( teeheehee! )  FELOID :....Crashed out outside the airing cupboard.   Got to the clinic this morning to find that me therapy cancelled ...*relief*.  I am such a chickenshit...  But, hell! I'm medicated: so whatthefuck?!!  On the upside, it's midday and I am out of bed and doing stuff; have actually walked about  owtsighyed , bought strudel for the HeffLord; who is also out of bed, stripping in the hallway (paintwork, you sick fuckers), and happi also.  *scratches hed*  Summat's not right wif this pic...?  *shrugs*  So we finally got round to starting the decoratin - which is good (if bleedin messy: not much organisation or discipline involved at the moment).  We now have a nice, clean and paint-free, quarry tiled hall floor - thanks to me, a bucket of hot soapy water, a couple of pan-scourers and a serrated kitchen knife (that is now two inches shorter, and a HELL of a lot sharper, than it was). Took a whole day; me nails are fuXXored; but it was worth it.  I skanky carpet down; 6 to go...  As you might have inferred, the woodwork's being stripped at the moment. It's coming up okay; but needs a lot of arse-achingly tedious and laborious scrubbing after it's been stripped.   Mostly to get out the scorch marks, it has to be said.   So, I'm out of practice with the hot air gun - bite me.   It's a cool tool though - all bright yellow and black and shiny and new. Heff's Dad buyed it for us coz he couldn't be arsed with the hassle of sending us his.   We looooove you, Daddy Heff!!  *does mad little powertool-owning jig with maniacal grin and added whooping*  I have a small 'fession here: I love powertools.   I am a powertooliac.  A powertooliaholic.   And a powertoolophiliac.   (Possibly, I should seek treatment?)  Actually, I need to seek more powertools.  And somewhere to store them, where I can arrange them all in an easily-accesiible fashion - that also allows me plenty of opportunity to gloat over them whenever I feel like it.  Especially now that we have a Screwfix catalogue.   (Credit-card shuffles off to hide, quaking, somewhere it thinks I can't find it)  (But  HA !!! I  know  it's down the back of the sofa!!!)  Who knew you could get them actually  delivered , to your actual  front door , within   24 hours  ?!!?   *madbounce*    Hmmm....it's now a toss-up whether I would prefer books, or powertools, delivered with my morning mail.  I think Heff was a little startled (and a tiny bit nervous) at the reaction the arrival of the woodstripper got...   *grinz*  I want a bandsaw and a hammer-drill now.  Pity we're brassic...  *sigh*  Especially as we missed the munchy-meetingy thingy in Tow-un 'coz of the bleedin cat costing so much at the vet that we had sod all cash left after.  [NTS: take credit card to vet next time, cretin.]  I  SO  wasn't meant to be poor....  Woah! It just started snowing! It's nice and sunny, too; so hopefully there'll be pwetty snowfall wifout the inconvenient  icky piles of the poxy stuff collecting on the ground and making everything slushy and non-clutz-proof.  I hate snow.   Well, if I have to DO anything outside in it, anyway.  Apart from rolling around, fighting, making angels and tunnelling my way through massive, scary drifts of it.  ~ Tip of the day ~  If it's snowy and someone offers you a home-made snow cone: if it's yellow, politely refuse.  God my PC speakers are fucked!  This FF cd is so crackly it sounds like my old, kicked around, spliff-roller-abused, chewed-apple-smeared, stiletto-dented, chocolate milkshake-soaked vinyl from when I were a young lass.  Yeah, actually, they DID have vinyl in the 'olden days'; but, no, there weren't still vinyl-grazing dinosaurs when I was a kid - thanks for asking.  *glares*  More small adventure today: I'm going into town this afternoon - by meself; and on the BUS!!!! - to meet someone I  hope  is still a mate.  (Not Sarah: we sorted all that out. I was being paranoid (cue ironic laughter). Tho, as I said, I wouldn't  have blamed her.)  I'm a wee bit - well quite a lot - nervous about this meeting.  Haven't seen her for  ages ; and a LOT of sewage haz oozed along the pipe since we met last.  She's a really great person, tho; and we'd hardly got much of a chance to get to know each other before all the bollox started and we kinda lost touch.    I hope it works out OK: really, there's no good reason why we  shouldn't  be mates - no matter whatevatheHELL is going on around us.    Assuming we actually  do  get on, of course.  Might discover that, in reality, we loathe the sight of each other!! >=- 0  Heff has just gone upstairs to remove the panel on the back of the book-room door. We're hoping it's a decent Edwardian wooden door underneath  sans  paint: one less lead-loaded-paint surface to strip.  Tho he looks kinda cute wif me black&white 'skull and crossbones' scarf ( the  essential element of my infamous "Pirate Decorating Outfit") tied round his face, like a cowboy bank-robber! (We haven't got any masks yet).  He was hoping to start on getting rid of the dreaded woodchip in the hall today (yay!!); but the wallpaper steamer needs a new plug.    You have no IDEA how  hard  it is to get a bleedin rubber plug in this bloody town.  It's hardly plutonium, or suchlike; but there are none to be had. He's ordered one from the 'lectric shop round the corner. Hopefully it'll come in this avo: the bleedin wallpaper is really starting to get on me tits.   Especially now it's all scorched, peeling and splattered liberally wif floor-oog.  But, on the plus side, I'm hoping to arrange the delivery of 1/4 ton of gravel from the guys round the corner, as soon as some money goes into my account.  (Sodding gravel's no problem, apparently. There are people falling  over  themselves to sell us fucking   gravel  !)  AND I found a window cleaner who's an ex-student of mine.   I know: this is a weird thing to note in my blog (unlike everything else I drivel on about in here, eh?!); but I have terrible 'burglar psychosis'; and I do  worry  about odd little men with ladders mincing around in my garden when I'm not here and all the windows are open.  So it's cool to have someone I know and trust to clean my windows.  Though it's something of an indictment of the employment opportunities 'round here that a 30something bloke with a good cultural/research degree ends up cleaning windows...  *sigh*  It's nice to know that my efforts as a lecturer paid such dividends for my beloved students.  Roll on the PhD...  *ironic rictus of cynical  amusement*  But no!   No bitching an' whining: I am HAPPI today.  It's really scary.   (For everyone else).  Well, do I sound scared to you?  I'm toying of the idea of getting rid of the stair carpet and stripping and sandin the stairs by hand...  ...um...?  Increase meds,  peut-etre ?  >;- ]                                             .~*~.

        Suckitty suckitty   SUCK.......      MOOD:.... sui-/homicidal/miserable/grumpy/VERYfukkinfuckedoffINDEED  M.A.D Level:.... 9 (see above)  MUSIC:....eeevylDED people shouting at me inside my hed  FELOID:.... FUCKING    expensive  .    Life suxass, don't it?  Evie moved - before we could get together.  I pissed Sarah off by being a hopeless flake. Totally broke and found bill I thought I'd paid and hadn't. Council threatening to sue me. House situation worsens. Looks like no trip to London. Heff's PC still in bits. House a tip. People being boringly annoying and childish. Rent still in Limbo and STC getting antsy. The Cat being....well.....The Cat, I guess....some things NEVER change....  I am getting really   bored   with waiting for  'things to be sorted out' , so we can start  'getting back to normality'  and  'settling down'  and  'getting on with stuff' . It's like climbing a freezing mountain coz there's sunshine, warmth and sheter on the other side but, every time you look up, having climbed for hours and fucking  hours , the top doesn't seem to have got any closer at all...  Brane&I not coping V. well at the moment.  Spent most of last week in bed - asleep.  Unusually.  Yes, not even knitting or watching telly.  Actually crashed out.  It's THAT bad....   OKay, so it's a blip.   And I know it's mostly coz of the therapy stuff stirring the murky shit up from the bottom of the bottle that I've been studiously allowing to settle for the last 20 years.  I kinda expected  that .  But it means that I'm a whole lot less able to cope with other cuntstacks and numbnuts fucking with my hed.   And, just at the moment, they seem to be queuing up.  I mean, fuck, do I have the big, pink, flashing, neon 'Kick Me' sign stuck to the top of my hed again, or what?  I dunno: but I'm in hermit mode again....partly coz I just don't wanna be around people when I'm, like,   this    feeble, zoned-out, useless and pathetic; partly coz being asleep in bed all the time does tend to limit the time one has to spare for social interaction; but, at the moment, mostly coz this sudden back-swing means I'm right back to where I was a few months ago in terms of leaving the house -  to wit.  currently  I am not able to most of the time.   I'm now at the stage where it takes thought, care and deep breathing even to leave my fucking bedroom, sometimes; and even the rest of the house feels like an unfamiliar, threatening, unsafe landscape.  It's pissing me off.  Quite a fucking lot, actually.  Apart from the technical and logistical hassles of not, for example, being able even to walk the 100 fucking yards round the bleeding corner to the fucking postbox to post a sodding letter.  I realised the other night (while I was asleep - go figure) that, since Christmas, I have only been out in daylight three times - when I wan't going to some kind of medical appt. or other. (And even that's always with Heff; and half of the time I still have to spend hours psyching myself up to it, or trying not to think about it and dashing around at the last minute, so it's happened before I have a chance to hyperventilate and throw up, or totally bottle out)  I fucking hate this.   Can you spell 'p-a-t-h-e-t-i-c'?  Mostly, I don't fucking understand how it works - WHY can I go out at night, or in a car, with relatively little problem; but try walking round the corner for a loaf of bread and I black out? WHY can't I even travel as far as my parents' house, or to see Gran, without becoming majorly anxious and panicky - when I'm in a CAR the whole way, for fuck's sake? Why am I now finding it difficult to go anywhere there's people AT ALL - worse thatn I've ever been; but yet, in other ways, I'm so much better that it's almost unrecognisable?  It makes no logical sense. There's no real pattern I can grasp; no cycle I can really see clearly enough to break; and no improvement or change I can rely on to last for very long, or not to come back worse than before.  I HAVE been getting better; and a lot of those gains are still there: overall I'm less geniunely   mad   than I was. But some of the most annoying and debilitating, and breathtakingly cruel, of the individual 'events' or 'difficulties', associated with when I've been at my very worst, seem suddenly to have popped up again on their own.  As in, "fuck, didn't I deal with you already?  I thought you'd gone when I stopped lapsing into catatonia/trying to kill people/ breaking everything in the house / wanting to jump into the dock in the middle of the night?"  Ha.  Like anything's EVER that simple....I must have unconsciously lapsed into some kind of weird twilight-zone state of optimism, hopefullness or contentedness there, for a second.  Silly me!   Having thus moaned and whined and wallowed (I'm allowed: it's MY blog. If I'm making you reach for the scalpel-blades, or the bumper-family-fun-sized-pack of ultra-strong paracetamol and the quart of scotch, fuck off and read something bingley-jingly-sparkly and   "happi"   (*bounce*) instead) I feel a bit better today.  This is coz the Group finally started, so it's not the big black at the back of my hed any more, and they seem pretty unthreatening - as small herds of lunatics go; and coz I went out and walked about in the sun; and I got on a bus on my own; and coz I got to spend some time out of the house with people I lurve - including the person I most adore (wizened chunklets notwithstanding) having some fun.  Tho it suddenly occurred to me on the bus: I've just let myself in for FOUR HOURS of therapy a week!!!  FOUR fucking hours!!  For at least the next two months.   What the...?  If the hospital people get back to me within the next eight weeks, I'm going to have no time for anything that isn't pretending to be treatment.  (You know - all the deathlessly exciting and stimulating activities with which my hectic, madcap lifestyle is currently stuffed.)  Okay.....I'm currently rooting around under the desk for my 'escape from earth' kit: I feel in DESPERATE need of my fuck-proof hed and my portable hole, all of a sudden.  Still, Dave and I had a bit of a mutual support session this afternoon.  That made me feel lots better.   I think we agree that true friends are few and far between; and that people, generally, are selfish, unreliable, likely to drag you into their troubles if they can, neurotic, illogical, disappointing and pretty-much best avoided at all cost.  He was telling me about the latest round of crapfullness and social futility he's going through - why do people always like to work off their own misery on innocent bystanders if they can?    Anyway, he's feeling a bit low today - coz of the gasman trapping him in the flat for two-anna-half hours - and, as usual, feels there is really no-one he can kinda rely on in his immediate environment. This is because he knows it will end up either being used against him or seen as some kinda permission to tell him how he should be running his life.  And, like he said:  that's  just the people who are even remotely bothering to pretend to be vaguely interested and/or there for him.   Trouble with his job is the endless hangers-on. I gather he's having that unpleasant Gestalt moment of nasty revelation - the one where he realises that people he considered real friends are, in fact, really only in it for themselves and what they can get from him; and then only when it suits them or they can be bothered.  Simple solution: he's decided he's just quietly opting out - not going to allow himself to be dragged into the giant shitfest he thinks -  knows  -  is approaching.   Sounds like a plan to me.  Plus, it means he's likely to be round a bit more as a result.  (Does that last remark count as schadenfreude?? I hope not - it wasn't really meant to be selfish gloating...!?)  But I do so love Dave. He's totally the Man, yanno? Down-to-earth, breath-of-fresh-air and all that; but he's just cool to hang out with: realaxing, fun, stimulating and all that stuff.  You can say anything to him coz he's not judgemental. He cares; but he's forgiving and accepting of stuff - just goes his own way.   I love that he's such a pragmatist: I love his total lack of bullshit, manipulation and refreshing ability to see past the end of his own nose; and to accept responsibility for things without it being a whole, big, waily  'mea culpa'  deal. He can talk about all the shit that's happening to him in a calm, rational and constructive way. He's not into the whole 'poor me' thing: he's got a strong sense of self-respect that means we can talk, share, and neither is expecting the other to somehow DO anything. Just, well, listen, is all.  Make observations, empathise.  Offer support. Occasionally take the piss. That kinda thing. No pressure.  Overall, Dave's doing a pretty fine job of being positive, under the circumstances. He's neither wallowing and expecting gratuitous, pointless, sympathy (I think he'd throttle anyone who tried it); nor is he trying, unrealistically, to brush his feelings under the rug and pretend nothing's happening, everything's fine, business in Daveland as usual.   It's a pity that, when people see how strong, pragmatic, in control and unsentimental he is, they seem, often, to mistake it for a lack of feeling. As a result, I think lots of people think he doesn't need people to be there for him, sometimes, when he's taking shite. It's just that while he might need someone, he doesn't want any- and everyone involved in his life - crashing around like a herd of wild pigs, trampling on and picking over all his soft and wobbly bits and peering into dark, slime-infested corners with a bloody-great torch.  Of course, I have to keep reminding myself that this is not necessarily miraculous singularity: just that he's an adult.   I almost forgot what one looks like.   And I'm not talking how many years you happen to have been on the planet, either: clearly, this is no predicator of maturity.  Whatever - he's such a great bloke and I feel really priviledged to have him as a mate.  *thinks*  So it's not  all  bad, then.   Still got a   couple   of people out there who seem to give a shit, and be willing to accept with grace that I am a useless cunt through no choice of mine, and are not so utterly narcissistic that they take it personally.  (NB. Sarah doesn't count in the above: she's taken endless shite from me and I'm not surprised she's pissed off. I would be, too.)  Crap is a good sorter: you find out who your  real  friends are.   It's often surprising - in a positive way: they tend not to be who you think they will be.  As well as the, sadly predictable, disappointment of having to let go of people you really care about because they can't - or won't.  God, I'm waffling bollox.  Like I say, brainfuk.  I'm off to pray to the  "Recently-Deceased-Obscenely-Rich-Distant-Relatives-You-Didn't-Know-You-Had-But-Who-Have-Now-Died-And-Left-Their-Entire-Fortune-To-You"  fairy.  This is because Fate turned up with the dump-truck again this week:  the cat cost us £75 at the vet, we have a hugely overdue phone bill, are about to become telly-less and washing-machine-less, we have absolutely NO money whatsoever, and we STILL can't get the fucking digi-cam to work so we can raise capital by flogging everything we own on eBay.  I wasn't  meant  to be poor: I'm just  no  good   at it, yanno??  Elderly-Cat Pie, anyone?   Bit stringy; but, pound-for-pound, at least three times the price of half-decent Beluga....   *sigh*  .

      .~*~.  I am in a state of   COMPLETE   fear and panic today.   I can hardly breathe for the sheer, overwhelming anxiety of waiting for the absolute  worst  to happen.  Yes - it REALLY IS  THAT  BAD...  I got Heather with an ice cube and a slap on the arse last night; and she's vowed to have her revenge.  *quails*  Mind you, she  said  she was gunna get me in my sleep: and here I am, it's morning, I'm upright, breathing, no bruises, new scars, bits missing etc....  She's just piling on the agony by making me wait for it, isn't she?  O lord....  I DO hope she was kidding about the KY, though....  ...erk...!!  I did the latest quiz to keep my mind off things:   1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:   "So cryptic as to be almost meangingless. If there is a…"    2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?   A boxed plastic frog on a polystyrene lilly-pad.    3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?   Something about the history of sex on TV.    4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what time it is:   10.30am.    5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?:   10.49am    6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?:   Radio 4    7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?   Last night, about 9.00; swearing and emptying rain out of my wellies.    8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?   My eBay bidding page    9: What are you wearing?   Skuzzy black hoodie, long red skirt, black velvet slippers; glasses. I look  HAWT .  (not.)    10: Did you dream last night?   I dream every night. Lastnight was a nightmare about having to move house.    11: When did you last laugh?   Last night – when I totally dropped ice down the back of Heather’s neck without her realising what was going on until it was too late. AND I slapped her on the arse…     12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?:   A multitude of crud. Tho there’s a cool pic Garry gave me for my 21st – reminds me of better times.    13: Seen anything weird lately?   Where would you like me to start?    14: What do you think of this quiz?:   Think??

Think Monty Python and the Holy Grail.     17: Tell me something about you that I don't know:   I lived through a smallpox epidemic. (aged 5, in Belgrade)    18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?:   Lose the human scum that’s wrecking the joint.     19: Do you like to dance?:   O0oooooh, yeah. I look like a pillock, mind…    20: George Bush:   Which one? Not that it makes much odds: utter scum (see 18.); could be out-witted by green pond-slime.    21a: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?:   Etolle Caroline Bridgid Philomena.     21b: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?:   Fergus Slàine Aneurin Lafayette.     22: Would you ever consider living abroad?:   Yeah. I have an ambition to live in a cliff-top mansion on the West Coast of Eire and write - after I’ve made my fortune running a chain of fetish/BDSM brothels in Belguim and Holland.

      .~*~.   It's raining.  Cooooool!!  I live with someone I hardly know; with whom I never speak unless there's a crisis.    I have to read his blog to find out what he's doing/where his head's at/what he wants.   It always comes as a surprise.  It is making me deeply unhappy.  Last night was a bit of a pisser: Heather took off all her clothes, painted herself green and spent all night with the cable-finder pointed at the sky muttering something about going home.  I dunno.   *shrugs*  Prap's it's not enough drugs.  I see she managed to get a pic of her green arse and stick it on her profile, tho...  The garden looks quite good in it, actually.  Well, you can't see the shed...  I think the whole elf-poison thing must be reaching her brane.  Today I may go and pay this cute little blokey I know to poke a big needle in me.  *raises index finger to the Universe*  .~*~.

      .~*~.    It's official: I am not meant to have any fun...    ...not without me and everyone else having to pay for it in hurt, misery and confusion, anyway; and the price is just too damn high.  P'raps the Universe is trying to tell me I'm now too old for all this shit.  Last couple of days have been largely a washout.  Moday was fun - went shopping; bought some nice hair for dreads - really cheap; but made an ad-hoc wig to go out in first. I looked a bit of a sight; but gave me some practical ideas and insights for the one I was constructing for real.   Ironically, I was pretty positive and hopeful. Looking back over the last couple of months, I've been here before: I just can't spot the fucking pattern developing, you see.  But things really did look like they were going to be good, on Monday. Not oly did I actually manage to get myself together and out of the house relatively calmly (despite all the helpful little opinions in my hed telling me otherwise); but I ALSO walked into a strange bar on my own - albeit in a bit of a hyper-manic-state, having walked up and down the road for 20 mins psyching myself up to it first - which I haven't been able to do for over a year.  And things went pretty well for most of the night; some fun was definitely had; and it was SO good to be out of the fucking house and see a few of the people I'm fondest of, and who deserve it the most, seemingly  relaxing and enjoying themselves. But then, predictably enough, I misunderstood, or couldn't see the crap bubbling under - whatever: things weren't what I thought they were; so it all ended in complete disaster in the end.   When we got home Heff decided forcefully to concur that I am scum and a waste of molecules; so that's pretty-much unanimous, then. Of course, I still didn't get it. Honestly? I still don't. Massively confused at the sudden turn of events - I just couldn't understand what happened and how everything could flip-side so quickly. Obviously, I was missing stuff: I seem to have developed this knack of treating people like shit without noticing. I don't feel like I'm behaving any differently from how I used to/ usually do; but this stuff never happened before I got sick; so I must be.  Anyway, by 3am my brain was off on one on it's own and I was at psycho-overload and couldn't sit still; so I left the house at three and spent the night walking around talking to myself, thinking about the things that have happened since I moved here, and since I got sick, and waiting till my brain wore itself out and I could hear and see clearly again. It's very hard to focus on and make sense of external reality when there's all this inescapable noise and chaos in your head; the only fix is to walk till it burns itself out into numbness.  I found that it's got hard to do this now, as they've ponced up the docks and built so many "luxury riverside apartment"  blocks that there's nowhere isolated, private, dark and scary enough I can go anymore to recover my senses. (One happy thought filtered through, though: bet the purchasers of said 'apartments' aren't told about the emptying of raw sewage into the dock every night before they cough up the ridiculous sum of money the developers demand.)   I ended up wandering aimlessly through the town centre till Costa opened at seven; drank coffee and cowered in a corner like a mad old bag-lady scribbling gibberish in my notebook; then staggered home about 8.30, so exhausted I was scarcely able to put one foot in front of the other.  Must have looked pretty bad coz the Taxi-driver leapt out of his seat to open the door for me and help me out. THAT never happened before.  Gran phoned me at about 9 and I was in such a state that she felt compelled to cancel her dentist's appt. and show up here at 10.30. I don't really remember: I'd attempted to barricade myself in the bedroom and passed out.  Sorry Gran. She came back at about 3, I think, and we chatted downstairs for a while. She thinks Heather roXor - which she does. Really. I don't know how things would have gone if she hadn't been here - though I feel really bad about all the shit she's had to put up with. Gran was reviewing her larcenous tendencies for the entertainment of those present. People think, I am sure, that I must at least be exaggerating about the exploits of my Grandmother; but it's all perfectly true. In fact, I don't tell people about many of her worst excesses - there's no point: they'd think I was making it up.  Anyway, Heff went and got Kentucky in a cab, which we et in the living room; then I must have fallen into a deep sleep on the sofa coz suddenly it was 9 o'clock. Watched a couple of films; then I was woken at 4 and put to bed. I only just woke up - it's about 1, I think. Night was full of shit-weird dreams: about closing Hogwarts for the holidays: finding people's soap, rolling up duvets for them, uniting parents with their respective offspring, turning off the flow of ants, letting the rats out of the basement, rescuing hats and knickers from among the rafters, etc - all while flying.  Then I was dreaming about this poor woman with seven kids who had to keep moving coz she was so poor; which ended up being an extended dream about this mill. The bits where people were tortured to death or hanged coz they'd infringed some petty rule or other were a bit graphic and extreme; and the bit where the 13 year old Prince of Wales (c. some mythical 18th century) was assigned a mill-girl to 'look after' him (read: for him to fuck) and given his own, luxurious, room in the otherwise appallingly squalid women's quarters, was a little on the odd side.  So yesterday was a non-day: I keep thinking it's Tuesday.  I have a HUGE blood-blister on the sole of my foot and my legs hurt like fuck from having walked around for five hours or so, on top of trudging round town during the day and dancing all night. The house is full of extraneous crap and Screwfix stuff - especially the living room half-full of floorboards - and the rest of the house is otherwise utterly trashed and full of various kinds of shit. Every article of clothing I own is randomly strewn around the bedroom and I don't know what's clean and what's dirty so it will all have to be washed again.  I should be doing something about all this I guess but I feel too overwhelmed, exhausted, and hopeless to do anything - I just want to go back to sleep and forget about everything right now.  So, yes: I am sunk in wallowing, self-pity and wearily cynical disbelief. I don't really give much of a fuck about it any more. It doesn't change anything, so what's the point?    One thing is for damn sure, though: my social life - such as it was - ends here. This is the last time I'm going out in an attempt to have a nice, normal, night out, only to have the world crash in on me almost immediately. I definitely shouldn't be around people: everything just seems to get fucked up; and when even the people I am closest to concur that I am a useless shithead, I guess it's time to take some notice. All this 'you shouldn't hermitise, you need your friends' bullshit is just that: bullshit. Obviously, I'm neither ready nor capable enough; as the Universe is at pains to keep demonstrating - despite my endeavouring to ignore the bleeding obvious up until now.  Not any more, though: I am surrendering, finally, to the inevitable: okay, you win - I get the message: I give up. I can't cancel the party; but, otherwise, that's it.  .~*~.

      .~*~.    Lalalalalaa... *skips about happily in the sunshine*    Having spent the whole of yesterday in bed, I got up early this morning, and have just eaten the rest of Heff's Fruit Pastiles (all 6 of 'em) for breakfast - along with the usual big hit of caffeine and nicotine that kick-starts my day.  So I am feeling GOOOOOOD....  *gasp*  Won't last, mind.  I now have....a  lawnmower !!   *Gasp*    (Thanks Dad!).    So, at some point, I can shave sufficient of the garden to finally lay the Bunny to rest.  I hope that he is wrapped in enough stuff that he won't make me gag when I retrieve him from the compost bag....not least because I have plans for the compost; and I can't lug another sack of it home from the sheds.  It was an interesting week, last week; more activity in the one week than in the previous six months. And I didn't freak, seriously, even once!!  The ITSC bogged off down to Kent to sort out his stuff - now that he's definitely off to be shot at by Arabs, he hasn't got the leisure to hang about.  I don't know what his plans are beyond that - he might come back here for a bit; he might not. He might go up to Hull to stay with his wuss grrlie-f(r)iend; but, personally, I think he'd be better off spending the money on therapy.  Hey ho.  Waiting to see if the Screwfix supplies arrive today: will be interesting if they do as, having totally failed to sort out any of the house over the w/e, I have absolutely no idea where we're gunna put it all.  Had a long chat with Heff this weekend - after a slight disagreement over his blog. He claimed there was no point in keeping one if he couldn't be  brutally  honest; and closed it. I pointed out that making comments about one thing - but in such a way that they are begging to be misconstructed - is hardly honest; and told him that the resulting spats and drama were really upsetting me.  I really do not have a problem with him saying, open and honestly, what he thinks, if he chooses; but disingenuity just makes problems.  Dunno whether it got through; but at least he's re-opening his blog.  We also covered a lot of 'relationship' ground. Things are getting better and better; but it's a struggle sometimes. Having lived together for approaching a year, it feels like we should really have sorted stuff out by now; but, of course, we have been too busy sorting out shite and fire-fighting to put much energy and time into the whole 'getting to know you and building a relationship' thing.  This makes doing it now both easier and harder: easier because we have a fair idea of how the other will react to stuff and can be tactful in approaching certain subjects; harder in that we think we know each other well enough to know how the other thinks/will react - when, in actual fact, this isn't always the case.  Second-guessing each other, and making assumptions, has caused quite a few problems; and we aren't always communicating as well as we should/could be.   So far, though we've had a few bumps and hillocks to overcome, it's getting sorted - slowly - but, overall, pretty well. I love the little bastard to death - more each day; so I hope we can make it work. I think we will, in the end; but, if not, I'm not gonna sacrifice my whole life, and my ambitions, to ANY relationship - no matter how much I adore my beloved.   I've pissed away too much of my life already: gotta make the most of what's left.  I mean, I   am   knocking on a bit; and I'm already pressing my luck (dignity-wise, at least) to get away with some of the stuff I do.  Ageing perve is one thing: sad and pathetic old perve is summat completely different.   I don't intend still to be trotting around in corsets when I have to fold my spaniels' ears in half to achieve a decent cleavage...  Nonetheless, career-wise, I am seriously considering the whole 'pro-domme' thing again....but from a more psychological angle.    I am interested in the mental processes of D/s, and want to see if I can dominate someone in a purely psychological way, with the minimum of physical chastisement.  I know there are people out there who want this - something that, really, can usually only be achieved in a 24/7 relationship. However, there are people who are just too occupied with other things to engage in such a time-consuming commitment, and all the other things that go with a relationship in general, and a full-time D/s one in particular.    So I'm thinking about trying to see if elements of such a 'relationship' could be constructed as a business arrangement: that is, whether someone can develop a purely psychological dominance over a client, on the basis of a more permanent 'arrangement' than is usual between PD's and clients.  Making it horrifically difficult for the client to access and achieve would be the first step; though, as I don't wanna advertise - with such a small and specialist potential client-base, I see no point; plus, advertising gets the usual morons crawling out of the woodwork to waste your time - I am thinking it will take a long time to find the five or six clients I would need to support myself.  Not sure exactly how it would work, in practice, yet: it's just an idea at present. Tho I got plenty of time to develop it: I wouldn't even consider doing anything until I am well enough to be sure I can offer the level of commitment such a venture would require.  Anyway, just another potential wheeze to keep a roof over my head without having to resort to working for 'the man'; and to fund future studies.  Oh well, enough rambly bollox for the time being.  I am off into town to meet Nick, get Sarah's b'day pressie and buy some false eyelashes. I haven't worn 'em for years but I have the urge.    Second Renaissance?? Or just a Renaissance of the first Renaissance?  Finally, I am feeling much better.  I am becoming myself, again, I think...  .~*~.

      .~*~.   MOOD:....Happy/relieved  M.A.D Level:....not really - unless cleaning counts  MUSIC:.....boingy-waily game music   FELOID:....annoying Heather  BUNBUN:..... Still  in the compost bag.    Whoop-de-dooo!!!  The ITSC's twinkie GF just left - she lives in Hull:   nice and far away from me.    Fair to say, I didn't like her, much. Not only is she of that dreadful "primary school teacher" female personality type that makes my teeth itch, I think she's a gold-digger - and a ball-breaker, to boot. She treats Dee like one of her juvenile charges (she's a nanny) and this makes my fists itch.  Quite a lot, actually.  Mostly, though, when she's around, it feels like there's a big wall gone up around Dee. Heff noticed it too. When he's on his own, he's a nice, funny, relaxed bloke. When she's about, he's a lot more circumspect; like he has to present a sanitised version of himself for her benefit.  And he doesn't tell her stuff he thinks will make her freak - like the fact that he's been told he  will  be going to Iraq after all. If he can't be honest with her, and constantly feels like he's working 'round her, what's the point?  It seems like a pretty immature relationship, to be honest; and I think she'll screw him over again (she's done it once already) without a second thought, if it suited her purposes.  Well, she made my hackles rise coz, when he was showing her round the house, she was planning all sorts. Dee was making feeble demurring noises; but she just talked him down.  The deal is, we get to renovate the place and, as long as nothing extreme is on the cards, and Dee has the money and okays it, it's   our   decision what we do with it. As far as he's concerned it's our home to do with what we like.  If she thinks  she's  gonna be running the show, she's got a   BIG   shock coming. She might be able to wheedle 'round Dee; but she'll start losing teeth if she starts trying to dictate to me.  No one else liked her either, mind. Heff was positively miserable while she was here. Now she's finally fucked off, he's all cheery and positive again.  We both hated the feeling of being guests in our own house, and having to mind our p's and q's around her, just in case her delicate sensibilities were offended.  Dee, on the other hand, got the whole "Vanilla Folk's Introductory Guide to BDSM" on Wednesday and thought it was all cool - though not his thing: he'd just fall about laughing if anyone tried to top him; and he has many other outlets for his familial streak of twisted sadism.  It's no accident he's an army instructor.  Anyway, the old cow's gone now and we can get back to normal.  I just had quite an entertaining morning on the Screwfix website, spending Dee's money on new flooring for the whole of the downstairs, and a range of other exciting decorating products. 15 litres of stabilising solution!!! w000t!!  (yeah, I got an odd decorating supply and power-tool fetish.   So  ....???)  Today I am going to do a bit more cleaning and sorting in the house.  This is kinda a slow build up to emptying the place for the 29th: if I can get really organised, moving stuff and then putting it back after will be much less ag; and decorating will cause less absolute and total fucking chaos and destruction.   Then we are off to the pub - dry run for Sarah's mad b'day groove on Monday. Oooooh, reminds me: must go and buy some false eyelashes tomorrow. And get the old bag a pressie of some kind. She's sposed to be giving me ideas; but none have been forthcoming so far. Guess I will just have to use my imagination, then....  *Vast gales of maniacal laughter and generally eevyl cackling*  I have this bad history with presents: people seem either not to get them 'till months after the event (Sarah and James' C*******S pressies are still sat on top of my wardrobe); or cretinous blondes open the prezzie, then leave it behind. It's very flattering: you devote all this time and agonising to try and get them something nice - or at least amusing - and five minutes after they've opened the box, it's gone completely from their head.  Just coz it's not something they can get wasted on...  *sigh*  Heather just got back - she was out all night. OOooooooh, naughty, bad, girl!! (I think she'd just had enough of the ITSC's GF. At least  she  had the option of pissing off out of it for the night).  I think she's gonna fit in really well round here: she's already making friends with all the coolest people (my mates: who else? I know ALL the insane and eccentric bods 'round here!).  The bummer is that the band might have left on tour before the 29th - so possibly no Dave! >:-(  They're in rehersals at the mo - so at least he's around for a bit - bodily present, that is: he's usually to be found wall-eyed and giggling while he staggers about in the gutter and trips over stuff). I keep threatening to go  and visit him at the flat; but haven't quite managed to get 'round to it, yet.  It seems to be constantly one fing after anuvva -  STILL : and although not all of it is "MORE SHITE" [TM], I still never seem to have any time to actually DO anything.  Tho Heff has promised more beatings, torture and experimental orderings-about in the not-too-distant future....  *drools*  MORE TOYS!!!! BIG Hurty PUNISHMENT equipment!! Need TOYS!!! Black eevyl looking ones with sharp pointy cutty bits on and buckles and fings!!!  Oh, and I s'pose Heff might get summat to use on me, too...  Anyone got a bag of clean wet tissues they don't want? Feathers? Cotton-wool balls? No??  Uh-oh...  Heather is now ranting about socks, with a towel on her head: so I better go and give her her shots and put her back in her "calming place" (the cupboard-under-the-stairs) in her "happy coat" (the straightjacket) before she gets any worse.  The excitement has obviously been just a teensy bit too much for her, poor lamb.  *laughs happily*  Happy week-end, mad bloggy peeps: have some fun, yeah??  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Okay, it's 8.39, Wednesday morning and I haven't been to bed yet. I nearly made it at around 4...then I decided I'd quickly check my mail, in between clearing up after dinner; and suddenly I found I had more important things to do than sleep...  I'm not all that surprised: I had a feeling. Nor am I shocked: shit just tends to happen in a more concentrated form to some people - you just have to suck it up as best you can at the time.   I  am  concerned, though: that decisions are being made without any other perspective being considered on important parts of the equasion; and that more information - however unwelcome or complicating it may be - is better than not enough and all from the same source; especially when your choices are big ones.  Anyway, I spent all night doing my little bit: now it's none of my business - beyond hoping for the best.  And I do really hope for the best for everybody; I've just been made wearily fatalistic and cynical by years of observing and experiencing, repeatedly, the worst happening instead.  It seems that bad things don't tend to happen to bad people all that often; while good things seem to happen to good people hardly  ever . Conforming to the basic and inevitable law of the Universe that, if it CAN go wrong, in even the smallest part, it will - and then snowball from an issue, to a glitch, to a difficulty, to a tragedy, to a disaster...and, before you can say 'Fate', all the wheels come off at once and you have a boundless catastrophe on your hands.   *sigh*  On the positive front: ITSC has had all his ops and is fine. He has a titanium plate in his head that will be there for the rest of his life; but his eyesight is returning in the damaged eye; and he didn't have to have any of his facial bones pinned as, when the surgeon went to push the depressed bones back up to roughly where they belong, there was an audible 'pop' and they all snapped back into place. So they're  pretty confident it will all hold together firmly enough to heal without further surgical buggering about.  Mind you, when I saw Dee yesterday, he didn't look as bad as I expected; but, although I was prepared for more bruising and swelling, I was shocked to be confronted with a vision of Frankenstein's Monster's little brother when I walked into the ward this evening. He now has bits of his head shaved, a huge black eye that is swollen shut and weeping, two scars full of  theatrical-looking stitches; and half his face is swollen up to the size of a fairly respectable water-melon.  He's bearing up pretty well, though. People are often amazed by his fortitude, lack of drama and seeming non-reaction in the face of really quite traumatic stuff. What they don't realise, of course, is that having managed to survive his childhood, there's not much else the world can throw at him that's anywhere near as painful, traumatic or difficult to cope with.  I reckon he wakes up every morning and notices that he's still alive; and is consciously grateful and amazed for it: coz he realises how easily he could not be.   Anyway, they're x-raying him tom...uh...in about an hour and a half; then I'm going to the hospital to bring him home.  Yes, that's  here , to my house; and I've changed my mind: I'll be glad to have him.  He's a good bloke. I always knew this: but the knowledge was obscured by the feelings of guilt and insecurity I feel about the house and the rent situation; and, particularly, by the trauma of having to tell him about Eoin. Which I ended up having to do in the waiting room of the MF unit - coz he asked me how the little sod was doing and I couldn't outright lie to him.  Especially as he would be in my bloody house expecting a tearful re-union with his pet  in less than 48 hours' time.  As I should have known, he was laid back about everything. It was obvious that the thought of holding us - well, me - responsible for any of it never even entered his head. I think he was more concerned for me, for having actually to facilitate the demise of his Wabbit, than he was for himself at losing his wikkle fwend.  He also has no probs with the rent, the decorating, the state of the house, or any of the other things I was being told he was 'in a state' about.  WHEN will I learn to trust my instincts and my own judgements?  It would save me - and all those dearest and closest to me who have to watch me freak and panic on these occasions - so much fucking grief...  So in the event, like I say, I am more than grateful to find myself in the fortunate position of being able to repay, in some tiny way, all the kindness, patience, faith and generousity he's shown us.  Okay, so he's not the world's most organised, efficient and totally reliable inhabitant; but his heart really is in the right place and he's a better person - for all his little 'ways' - than most of the rest of the planet's population with whom it has been my misfortune to have to deal.  Plus, he's only staying till Friday. Then he's determined to haul arse down to Kent to check on his house; by which time his unit will be in Dover - handily close by.  It's also certain that, whatever happens, the army will look after him. He's on contract till February and, now that he's packed in his job, rented out his house etc, in anticipation of a long posting, they can't  suddenly say 'sadly, you're now unfit for active service', invalid him out, and leave him to fend for himself.  So even if he doesn't go to Iraq in the end, they'll have to pay him and look after him; so they'll probably find something for him to do here. He's a qualified instructor in several things; so it shouldn't be too hard for them, or miserable for him.  But he seems pretty unperturbed by the whole prospect; so it's all looking cool - especially in light of the huge amount of compensation he'll be getting, now that Plod has figured out what happened: the guy who totalled him was snoozing peacefully at the wheel as his people carrier happily trundled along, down the wrong side of the road, at 60+ MPH. Conveniently, the bloke was decent enough to accept full responsibility: by all accounts, he was fucking wobbly, having grasped immediately how lucky he was not to be looking at a corpse instead of a slightly battered, bloody and shaken - but wise-cracking - Irish squaddy.  He's thinking about using the money to buy another house in Ipswich....  *sigh*  Heathery-poo is also having some success on the dwelling front. We're not quite there yet; but huge effort is being expended and it's looking hopeful.  I can't wait.  I am loving having her around; but still feeling bad about all the cleaning and stuff - especially now that she is being relegated to the sofa. Not that she seems to mind at all: she's a truly lovely human being, that girl; and I feel very lucky to have her as a friend.  Annyway, I'm now dying for a wee; and I have to be at the Hospital in an hour or so, so I'm off.  Hang loose, and carry a lightbulb, all you mad little blog-reading-type dudes, and have a good day!  Give someone you like - but don't know well enough - a big hug:  just for the sheer, uninhibited, joyous, hell of it all!  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Okay, so it's been a mixed bag lately.  Crap out of way 1st:  No word from ITSC; bunny still unburied; spent all w/e playing FFIX; unexpected (unpleasant) surprise in pub on Saturday; hall ceiling fell down yesterday; therapist phoned this am to see WTF happened to me; now so sleep deprived I'm almost hallucinating and Heff looks like he's got a bad case of conjunctivitis in both (squinty, dark-shadow circled, bloodshot) eyes.  Cool. That's that done then.  So!  GOOD stuff:  Heathery-bebe is here!! It's so cool: though I fear she has been bored shitless as Heff and I have been sorting out some 'issuse'; and I have been unable to haul my carcase out of the pit for most of the w/e.   I am very angry that she persisits in cleaning up the hovel: it's not fair; and how am I ever to attract any kind of cute house-keeper/play-thing if the hovel's all shiny and pristine?  (Ok, pristine and shiny are a bit optimistic: you'd need and industrial jet-washer and a flamethrower -and that's just for starters)  Still, she's sorted out my PC a treat. Apparently, what was slowing everything down was some hidden files she found on my second drive - Britney Spears porn, if you can believe it!!   *shudders*.    I wonder wtf  that  came from??  (Yes, I know I had ten minutes of Britney-appreciation a couple of months ago: but I quickly saw the light, upped the meds, and got over it. So it wasn't MINE, okay??)  Anyway, the Glampy put Zonealarm on the old P(ieceof)C(rap), having weeded out all the virussy files, and the thing is quite a lot less bleedin useless as a result.  Fank-ooo Glampy-poo: we WUVVV Ooooo - wots an' WOTS *soft furry snuggles*!!  (How to annoy a small Scots Psychopath: lesson one!)  *smirks*  Well, in between all the wild debauchery and vile pervesions we've been practicing since she got here (well, we had to do SOMETHING while Blaq and Heff ate sugar and pissed themselves laughing at jokes about Doritos) Heather and I have come to a startling conclusion: men are weird.  *gasp*  [heavy irony] well bless my cotton shreddies! However did I reach the ripe old age of nearly-37 without realising this before???[?heavy irony]  This was Gestalt moment of the week.  Twas nice to see Nick looking almost happy for a change. We bought him a mini-fridge for his birthday: he can put milk and beer in it, and never have to leave his room and encounter his house-cow till he moves now - except for work, buying groceries and having *cough* "fun".  The pub was a bit boring tho: I got cornered by a rather wasted Steve.  Saw pin'ead - with cool red hair - which was cool: last time I laid eyes on him he was being bundled into a taxi my Sarah, fleeing from intense attention from some-one or other...  Apart from that, I've just heard from the ITSC: he's sitting in the maxilliary-facial clinic, waiting to hear what they plan to do with his smashed-up face. We shall visit him later: hoping that the surgery goes to plan; glad that the stitches in his cornea haven't blinded him; and cordially, and with all good thoughts and best wishes, hoping he doesn't have to come and stay with us. Plus, I haven't told him anout the sad demise of Eoin, yet.  [VERY heavy irony] I'm   REALLY   looking forward to  that !! [/VERY heavy irony]  *Waves to Garry* If you're reading this, hunny-bunch, yes I got your addredd: will mail you soon, I promise!! Love to Vhari - and don't fall down/off anything till AFTER the party okay??  *smirks*  Better go get shit together: Dad taking us to Sainsbury's inna bit.  Mad social whirl, my life, innit??  *sigh*  .~*~.

      .~*~.  MOOD:....Happy anticipation M.A.D Level:....not hardly  MUSIC:.....The Gorillas Japanese Import Special Edition G Sides (apparently)  FELOID:....Still flattening next-door's plants  BUNBUN:.....Still in the compost bag.    Today has been good.  I awoke to coffee and toast at 10am, watched a little 'Bargain Hunt' and painted my toenails black.  Arising, I wrapped myself in my favourite Toga (pink and white striped brushed cotton bedsheet - practical AND smart!!), and descended to the Study, where I switched on my PC and painted my nails (black tulip).  Passing the time while my nails dried and I applied a second coat by monging about in the b.com forums, I was fed a chicken salad Subway sandwich at about 2 pm.   Remarking upon the vast quantity of lunch with which I had been supplied, my beloved was heard to utter the immortal line:  "You should have told me if you only wanted six inches"  thereby providing me with the opportunity to deathlessly quip:  "Darling, you should know by now, I ALWAYS want more than six inches!!"  Small amounts of hilarity followed.  Throughout the rest of the afternoon, I have happily surfed the net, emailed friends and other people, posted rubbish in the forums and periodically tested my nails for tackiness (both kinds).  In the meantime, I have been privileged to witness the rare sight of Heff 'clearing up' ; a peculiar and uniquely Heffish process that involves equal amounts of housework, eating and gaming, and general buggering about.  All highly entertaining: apart from if he gives himself concussion scrabbling around under his desk: I might need him later.  Anyway.  It is now my intention to go and heave my stinking carcase into the bath, in honour of our guests, Heather and Nick, who will arrive sometime after 6.30, bearing dinner and, we hope, beer.  Nick is in for an unpleasant surprise: we have a birthday present for him.  Wrapped by Heff - in Christmas paper (what else).  Thus passeth the day in pleasant distraction and virtual inactivity.  Tonight there may be apfelkorn; there will definitely be tears dripping off the end of Nick's nose (it's the effect Heff and sugar have on him); and there will also be lots of girlie squealing, bouncing about, over-excited capering and enthusiastic hugging, in honour of a long-awaited and keenly anticipated reunion.  I expect Heather and I will be quite pleased to see each other again, as well.   .~*~.

      .~*~.   MOOD:....speechless and disbelieving  M.A.D Level:....hysterically calm  MUSIC:.....Radio 4  FELOID:....Sleeping in the sun - sadly, on next-door's newly-planted bedding plants  BUNBUN:.....With The Wing-ed Bunny Angels.      My Easter.     By Slasha (Goddess)   aged 36-and-eleven-twelfths     Friday....     Really  great night out.  Started off a bit wobbly - couldn't find my meds; and panicked a bit when I got into the pub and saw how crowded it was; but sat outside wi Sarah till panic subsided.   After pub, went to Distinction. Saw loads of people I haven't seen for ages and was gratified to find that they hadn't forgotten me - had even noticed I had gone MIA!! Invited everybody to party.  Everyone got wrecked - esp. Dave and Sarah. Elf-boi got all maudlin and unloved; Mike's put his back out again, so much pisstaking and quips about parrots.  Gossip was passed around; laughs were had; drinking happened; dancing was perpertrated. Ran into Pin'ead at the taxi-rank and Sarah went off with him - not in the biblical sense. Heff happy - but managed not to get deliriously shit-faced and propose at the taxi-rank again.  So that was fun.      Saturday....    Universe hungover - everyone ill and grumpy.   'Cept for  Dave, who txt'd me that he was feeling like poo, but gunna do it again tonight!  I txt'd him back that he is a maniac. 'S all true....  Heffy felt like several especially concentrated forms of particularly nasty crap, and stayed in bed all day - despite   not   being visibly wasted the night before.   It's the beer in the Whore's: it just doesn't mix - especially not with lime-vodka, JD and bottles of Black-ice.  Or so it seems.  I stuck to voddy all night and was fine. Well, sore and achey from unaccostomed jigging about (headbanger's neck); but unhungover.  As a result of Heff's incapacity, I had to do all the shopping and Sprog-feeding (Huw's away, so we're  in loco parentis  his cat) on my own.  I haven't trogged about by myself for about a year, so I was quite pleased. Bought Heff lots of pressies - including an easter 'egg' (rocket, actually) with his name on.   Was s'posed to go to Eve's bash at the Vodka Bar tonight, but rang up and invited her over for dinner tomorrow instead. We were both far too knackered to go out - let alone drink; so decided to stay in bed and watch videos/play games on PS.  So, when I got back from town, we et Subway sarnies, macadamia-nut cookies, and watched "Eight Legged Freaks".  Which was interesting, seeing as Heff is  'not good'  with spiders.  He coped with the octopoid crawly ones better than I expected, though he jumped quite a lot when they did unexpected things. He only  actually  terrified himself  once : when he dropped popcorn down his side just as a huge trapdoor spider emerged and grabbed a hapless doggie.  Apparently, the popcorn made un unpleasant tickling sensation that meshed rather unfortunately with the image on the screen.   Thus a small scream was heard to escape from the mouth of an anxiously flailing Heff, as he shot out of bed like a bolt of lightning, and proceeded to slap himself enthusiastically all over - to ensure the complete removal of any stray arachnoid that might have chosen to take its evening constitutional Chez, as it were, Heff.  I thought he was vewwy bwave, actshully; and we were having fun.  Of course, this couldn't  possibly  last...  Peace was shattered by Gran leaving message on ansafone, rambling on about ITSC being inna state bout lack of rent forthcoming, having to go to Iraq while nothing settled and going bankrupt.   Major panic: much stomach-churning terror, etc. This soon gave way to hysteria, catatonia and, finally, psychotic fury.  I rang her back, by this time totally livid: 1. It's none of her goddamn business; 2. I have no control over the Council; 3. He knew it was going to take at least 3 months; 4. He never expressed any anxiety to me; 5. It's his own fault for taking so long to send us the Tenancy Agreement, which 6. he totally screwed up; so it had to be sent back and forth till it was sorted out. Thus, 7. The Council have only been processing the claim for 6 weeks, so far....  I told her her fortune in no uncertain terms - I was incandescent with rage at her implication that I was somehow responsible, and not keeping my end of the bargain - thereby letting her down:  coz (she feels) it was her idea in the first place - so her responsibility.  She acts like the ITSC is somehow doing us a massive favour - as if we're some kind of charitable cause - but only 'coz she asked him to (which is bollox: he's a businessman, and is getting totally free renovation that will significantly increase the value of the house).  After I'd pointed out a few home-truths and inescapable facts, she ended up trying to exculpate herself, by liberal application of the 'confused little old lady' hogwash; but I was unsympathetic. Especially about ITSC involving Gran in events - after the last time, and in light of the understanding I thought we had reached re. keeping her the hell out of it.   For precisely the reason that she has a tendency to shit-stir and create drama out of bugger-all.   Eventually, she confessed that  she'd  rung  him , so wasn't his fault; but I was inna bad way about it.   No smoke without fire, and all that; and it plugs straight into my biggest anxiety: that the council will screw up and we'll have to move.  Then Dad rang - she'd left the same msg on his phone (grrrr....) - and pointed out that she was prolly bored and winding me up; especially as I hadn't actually heard anything from the ITSC  himself .   I calmed down - it hadn't ocurred to me, bizarrely enough; and Heff's not used to her 'little ways' yet.  We subsided back under the duvet; but, by this time, we were stressed and knackered, so Heff went to sleep and I read and didn't go to sleep.     Sunday....    Got up at 8 and started cooking stuff for Ma's dinner on Monday, leaving Heff to sleep.  Despite being utterly knackered, I managed to push the nagging doubts to the back of my head and spent a happy day pottering round int kitchen.    After musing upon the subject for a few days, I'd hypothetically invented a new dessert for me Ma's b'day - tailored to all her favourite indulgences; but with as little sugar as possible so Dad could eat it too. Today was a preparation day, so I was only doing cool stuff like chocolate-dipping strawberries, making hazelnut praline, etc, plus looking up recipies for things I could 'adapt'.  Heff eventually got up - feeling better today - and 'helped'. He's a good cook's assistant, but, mostly, gets to run backwards and forwards to the shop when I discover I haven't got enough  whatever  for whatever I'm making. Or, I've just had to throw whatever I've made in the bin - and that was the last of the ingredients!!   But it was fun; and we now have a vegetable crisper with chocolate dipped strawberries I'm hoping won't go oogi before tomorrow neatly arranged in the bottom.  Heff thinks I'm nuts: he doesn't have my vision, you see?  Eve turned up at 7 and we had dinner - courtesy of Marks and Spencer and the random contents of my cupboard. I made 'thing salad' out of feta, apple, nuts, sultanas, dried cranberies and mayonnaise. Heff saw it and went 'what's  that ??' in a vaguely revolted voice. Apparently, it's not salad coz it doesn't have anything green innit. *rolls eyes*.  Still, didn't stop him from wolfing down half a dish of it: I made loads and it all went.   Not salad , indeed....  Then Nick came over - major house-cow hassles, and he's had enough. Good for him: told him he can stay here when he leaves, and before, if it gets too chronic.  Had a bit of bunni trauma tonight, too. Turned him over to give him his meds and noticed big patch of oogi fur matted under his chin. So broke out the salt-water and Savlon. Eve was holding him while I bathed it, trying to un-goo the fur. Then, as I was gently wiping it with a wet cotton-pad,  the whole thing MOVED....  I pulled the wodge of fur up gently to see what was underneath it.  Horrifyingly, I could see what looked like jawbone.  *shudder*  Vet's first thing on Wednesday...  Eoin didn't seem bothered at all. He stayed up, getting made a big fuss of by Eve, and bouncing about the living room buzzing and squeaking happily.   I, on the other hand, was so bumcurlingly squicked out that it became necessary to drink; so Nick and I started on the Apfelkorn shots.....goes down just like apple-juice, so we got through over half the bottle.  Stayed up til 4am telling stupid jokes - a la my bruvva:   Q. What's large and white and climbs trees? A. Rupert the fridge.  Q. What's blue and white and climbs trees? A. Rupert the fridge inna denim jacket.  Q. What's green and pear-shaped and hangs from a tree? A. A pear.  Q. What's grey and lights up? A. An electric elephant.  Q. What's yellow and goes "slam, slam, slam, slam"? A. A four-door bananna.  Q. How many folk-singers does it take to change a lightbulb? A. Five: one to change the bulb; four to sing about the old one.  You get the picture.   Nick and Heff did their usual: Nick had tears dripping off the end of his nose, and was wheezing like an old Dude on 60 Gitaines a day by the time he went to bed.  He does make me laugh - the sad git.  Hoping Apfelkorn doesn't give me a hangover - shitloads of stuff to do tomorrow...     Monday....    Got up at 9 - four hours' sleep - and started cooking again for Ma's dinner.  Felt incredibly knackered and vaguely hysterical from lack of sleep but, thankfully, not hungover.  Once I got into the cooking, felt a bit better; but had no idea I'd be paddling about in chocolate and stuff for the whole day, virtually non-stop.  'S amazing how long it takes to rustle up hazelnut pastry, chocolate sauce, praline mousse, creme patisserie and a few profiteroles.   Process wasn't helped by fact that I haven't done proper shopping for months, so Heffy kept having to run to the corner shop for flour, sugar, butter, eggs, etc. Poor boy - wasn't feeling the greatest; but persevered manfully.  Nick made the mistake of emerging just as the various chocolate components were nearing completion - by which time I was feeling a bit nauseated from playing with chokky all day; so he became official taster.  Praline profriteroles and creme pat. for breakfast - yummeeee. (Blech!!)  The olds turned up at 5 - shortly after I'd discovered the bleedin timer had arbitrarily swiched off the hot water, so I couldn't get a shower!   Nick kept them beautifully entertained while I scuttled about trying to make it look like we'd at least  started  making dinner.  Poor boy took my mother's grilling ("...I'm just  interested  in people...!!") pretty well - I don't think she asked him anything too wince-makingly personal or embarrassing - not that he mentioned to me, anyway.  He DID manage to mention, howerver - just as he was leaving - that it  might  be his b'day tomorrow.   Little sod told me it had already happened. Luckily, I've already seen his present - so he's not getting off that lightly.   There might even be  cake ...(tho, don't worry babes: the doilies are staying in the drawer!!)  Heffy did a stirling job of cooking the dinner - he does better roast chicken and roast potatoes than I do, now. He did the whole "calm and capable" thing - besides calming me down and stopping me from slinging everything in the bin in despair. As my feet hurt, hysteria and panic were setting in, and I needed a shower, I got relegated to the veg and the gravy, carving the chicken, and organising the timings, laying of the table, etc.  We were aiming to serve dinner at about 7: so, naturally, we finally sat down about 9.30.   At least I'd showered, tho.   And it was   goooooooooood   roast dinner - especially the gravy - so we all pigged out happily.  NTS. Baby carrots steamed with fennel seeds, contrary to assertions of recipe-book (I never cooked carrots before: I hate 'em. So I  had  to look it up - okay?), are revolting.  The dessert was a smash hit: despite my usual haphazard approach to making up recipes, this one  looked  impressive  and  tasted nice!!    This is almost unique, in my cooking experience: so I'm not letting on that, when I started to assemble it, I didn't have a  clue  how it would look - even if my plan would actually work: or whether we would be forced to scoop sticky globs of messi, chocolate oog from the serving plate, ferreting around in the mush frantically in an effort to locate the odd mythical strawberry....  But, it were good. It was a rich hazelnut-pastry base, with chocolate-praline mousse heaped on it inna kinda cone; then profriteroles filled with creme patisserie stuck on; and half-chocolate-coated strawberries shoved in at strategic intervals between them. The whole thing was then drizzeled liberally with warm chocolate sauce and dusted with icing sugar; a b'day candle stuck in the top and lit; and the whole thing served with lots of napkins/kitchen towel, a damp cloth; and a good dessert wine - properly chilled.  It was light, nutty and chocolatey, without being cloying or sickly. Well worth the two days it took to produce. Tho, now that I know what I'm doing, the next one will be faster and more organised. If I can be arsed, and/or remember what I did.  However, we didn't get to eat it till 10.30; so the olds took the rest and shoved off pretty-much straight after.  By this time, Hefflet and I were happy but all totally fuxxored; so I dragged myself round clearing up, filled up the Dishwasher to find we had no dishwasher tablets, stacked second load of dishes next to the sink; dragged self upstairs to bed, had a big fight with Heff when he finally showed up, cried for a few hours, then fell asleep about 5, Heff having been relegated to downstairs on the sofa.      Tuesday.....    Stayed in bed.   Knackered, aching, feeling sick: pretty clear I'd massively overdone it over the previous few days.   From zero-movement for 6 months, to mad partying, drinking, and non-stop cooking for 12 hours straight, is a  bit stupid, I guess.  No sign of Heff: cold, stony silence from sofa below.  Feeling pretty low and despairing, so decided to sleep.  Woken abruptly at 7pm by Heff.  "You'd better get up. I'll make you some coffee"  Turns out he'd woken to hear Gran - again - this time going on about "...had a car accident, and he's in hospital, the car is a write-off and he's lucky to be alive...".   As Gran can't wrap her head around the concept that you don't start talking till  after  the machine beeps, her messages all start half-way through. Usually, you just get "....then, ok? Byee! It's yer Gran. Give us a ring when you can, then. Okay? Byee!".   Of course, in  this  instance, as she hadn't  said , Heff's immediate thought was that it was my Dad who'd crashed; and, as she hadn't mentioned Mum  at all , I think he got a bit frantic 'till he'd phoned her back and managed to wring a few more details out of her.  Of course, it was Dee - ITSC - who'd had some asshole run into the side of his car: totalling it; and leaving him with a lump of glass in his eye and a jaw broken in five places.     I phoned Gran - who was still in shock and making even less sense than usual; then the local hospital (who hadn't heard of ITSC); then his mobile (switched off); before phoning Gran again, whereupon she revealed that ITSC was in a hospital in another part of the County.  Finally got to speak to him - very briefly, later that evening. He's lucky to be alive - the emergency services who got him out of the car couldn't believe he didn't have any major injuries. He's having his jaw wired back together on Monday and the glass removed from his eye ASAP - probably on Thursday. The Army is currently looking after him; tho he doesn't know whether he will be going to Iraq, now.  As he's rented out his house in Kent, if he doesn't go to Iraq guess where he's likely to end up?  I mean, he's my sort-of-cousin, and he's a good bloke, and he's majorly bailed us out and all; but it's gunna be  bloody  awkward if he's here for long.   I 'spect it would just be till he sorts out summat else; but the timing is, of course, totally reminiscent of the twisted sense of fun belonging to my arch-nemesis, Fate.  *sigh*  On the plus side, Heff and I were at least on speaking terms by the time we'd ascertained what had happened   I wanted to talk about the previous night; but he pleaded shock at waking up to Gran, and took off downstairs to play bloody games.  I waited till it was obvious he was avoiding talking about it - and me - and intending to try and pretend nothing had happened, before raising the subject again.  I was very hurt and sobbed a lot in the process; but we ended up sorting things out, finally. I think it moved us forward, overall; and Heff was a lot happier at the end.   So everything calmed down; but  a pretty sleepless night nonetheless: we didn't stop talking till gone 5 - and Heff's Ma is due to turn up at 10ish.  o joy.      Wednesday....    Heff woke me at about 9, with coffee- I think: I was semi-comatose and went straight back to sleep.   His Ma had turned up as planned, unloaded all manner of stuff from the car; and they'd gone off into town to 'see the sights' and have some lunch - leaving me to sleep, which was really lovely of Heffy. Though I felt pretty bad at not being there to hang out with his Ma - who is deeply cool, and whose visit I had bin really ooking forward to.  Finally woke at about 1, with a start, and the realisation that the Vet would be open today, and I should take the Bunny to see if there was anything they could do about his rotting chin.  Of course, I couldn't get an appt. till after 5 - which totally wrecked any chance of an outing to the coast with Heff's Ma.  So we sat and talked - mostly about education and how crap it's getting. Get teachers together, and this is what tends to happen....Heff didn't glaze over too much!  Finally, time came to bung the now-stinking Eoin into the catbox and take him to the vet.  I was feeling a bit apprehensive: I had a fair idea of what was coming.  Sure enough, the vet took one look at him and pronounced his doom.   Apparently, he must have had small abscesses in his jaw for months. Normally, you can tell, cause it goes all lumpy under the chin; but Eoin is so fluffy you'd probably not notice.  Well, the vet we took him to last week examined him pretty thoroughly for abcesses - after the cat had slightly chewed him: and she didn't spot it...  Finally, the abscesses burst and the poor bunny gets 'skin slough'. If this isn't too bad, sometimes they can sort it out and it will heal. But Eoin's was in a pretty bad state.  She peeled back the loose flap under his chin to show us: all the flesh had rotted away and you could quite clearly see what was left of his his jawbone, his upper teeth and oesophagus. It was disgusting: really shocking.  I felt terrible for him - guilty as hell - even though I knew he was doomed before we even got him;  and he had been pretty happy and lively, bouncing about the living-room on Saturday and getting millions of cuddles from Evie. So he wasn't suffering.  But I had to sign the consent form allowing him to be euthanased. I felt like a murdering criminal.  I gave him a big cuddle; then she took him away.    She was gone for ages. I was shaking like a leaf: Heff held me and did his best to soothe and calm me; but I finally had to sit down. I felt sick and numb. Despite the fact I'd pretty-much seen this coming, I was in shock, I think.    Bad enough when it's your own pet; but when it's someone elses it's terrible. Although we'd only had him for a couple of weeks, so much had happened that it seemed a lot longer; and constantly having to do horrible things to him (salt-bathing him, savlon-ing him, ramming meds down his throat, cutting crusty bits out of his fur, poking his scabs etc - I'm surprised he didn't cower every time I approached his cage), then comfort him afterwards, I'd got to be really fond of him.    Poor little thing.  I just  KNEW  the sodding thing would die if Dee left it to my tender mercies.  They asked me whether I wanted them to 'dispose' of him; but I couldn't bear the thought of not knowing what had happened to him. So I took him home, wrapped in a towel. Later, I wrapped him in his big piece of bed-fur, then the towel; put him in a placky bag and left him all wrapped up in the big bag of compost overnight.  Stupid, I know: but it was warm and smelled nice in the compost, and I couldn't stand the thought of him just being left out in the cold on the garden bench.   This is why I couldn't just put him out for the dustmen, either: it was pointed out that it would take effort to bury him: I'd have to dig quite a deep hole if I didn't want him making a reappearance in the garden courtesy of some local feloid or fox; but it seemed too cruel and cold just to put him in the bin.  I'm a mong, I know: but you would't put yer granny out with the trash, wrapped in an old binliner; and Eoin was the ITSC's wikkle fwend.   So Eoin, the Mad Irish Miniature-Dwarf Lop-eared Wabbit, is no more.  RIP, bunny.  *sigh*   It was cool to see Heff's Ma but I feel awful about how her visit turned out.  She drives all that way - to get half a day in the town centre, take us to kill the rabbit, hang about outside discussing disposal of same; then gets to eat cruddy pizza before crashing out early, coz she's got to get up at some ungodly hour of the morning to drive all the way back again.   I'm gunna send her some flowers: she was really cool about the whole thing.      Today....    Spent all last night having nighmares in which giant dead rabbits featured quite strongly - with or without rotting faces; and my parents forced me to stay at school for the summer holidays coz they wanted to go abroad without us. Also a reprise of the submarine dream - only this time I was s'posed to be driving (?) the stupid thing and the tourists I was ferrying about kept trying to take over, so they could hi-jack it and drive (?) to somewhere warm with a beach.  No sleep, therefore: and had to drag aching carcase outta bed early in case Bruvva showed up.   (He didn't)   (Quelle surprise)  Now I have to find the right time to break it to Dee that I had to have his rabbit put down.   Plus dig it a hole in the garden and return it to its component molecules.  So far today I've spent over an hour trying to get through to National Express to book Heather a ticket, only to find the coach is full and she'll have to come tomorrow.  Also, Heff's knackered and is still asleep upstairs. Poor little sod hasn't slept properly since last Thursday, so I'm leaving him to it.  House is trashed - so at least I've got things to do; and, coz of all the trauma, I missed bidding on the plants I was going to buy Ma for her b'day.   Okay, so I'm a pessimist, am I?  Things will take an upturn soon, will they?  Friday night I was happy: we'd had a pretty productive and happy couple of weeks, culminating in some actual   FUN  ; things were looking up; stuff was getting sorted at last. There were no immanent looming traumas on the horizon, I was organised, on top of stuff and feeling almost normal; and it seemed life would right itself, and begin to trot along relatively smoothly, in the not-too-distant future.   Now  look....  5 days later I have a dead rabbit on my hands, a vet's bill for over £40 to pay, and a bloody-great hole to dig; a battered sort-of-cousin, with a smashed jaw, possibly going bankrupt (or not), and with no car, who may want to move in for a while; a Grandmother I'm no longer on speaking-terms with; a belated and overdue (I just discovered) housing benefit appeal to write; a whole load of ebay cheques due and 100 mixed Begonia mini-plug plants to find - fast; a filthy house to deal with, a broken vacuum-cleaner (hence carpets covered in granola and cat-hair) and no clean clothes whatsoever to wear; and a brother who is going to DIE - on the basis that I got up massively early just so he could pick up my pet-carrier before he had to go to work, who then didn't show up.  Still, there is the birthday orgy to look forward too.   If nobody shows up, I am going to devote the rest of my life to tracking them down, one-by-one, and leaving manky dead animals in their beds while they are out.  I have one dead bunny to start with....   .~*~.

      .~*~.    Thought of the day:    how full of shit must you be to require an overflow pipe?   (Funny what pops into yer hed in the middle of the afternoon.)   I have had a stinky day renovating the hall stand Gran's given me. I only tipped linseed oil on the carpet once; but it stinks of it in there anyway, so nevermind.  The project was toddling along quite swimmingly until Heff came home with his mate Tubes.  Of course, I am right in the bleedin doorway, aren't I? Surrounded by oily kitchen towel and damp cloths. Plus, the nice peace and restful quiet was shattered into a million pieces; then Heff tried to set the kitchen on fire making toast; and finally, my jangling nerves were shredded even further when he started fussing about what clothes I wanna wear tonight, are they clean, where are they so he can wash them and, finally, announcing he'd found two of my dresses that were clean and laid them out on the bed for me.  I know he is only trying to be helpful; and that he thinks he's forestalling crises further down the line; but, whereas I was quite looking forward to tonight - inna 'try not to think about it too hard' kinda way, now I am feeling all stressed and anxious about it.  This is not helped by the fact that I'm totally unused to being around other people, and having someone I don't know in the house is making me more than a little antsy too. It's not his fault - he's a nice chap; just that I don't know him; and am not used to having to interact with strangers. Funny, I almost loathe this house, I spend so much time trapped in it: but now someone I don't know has turned up, I feel like my territory has been invaded and my personal space violated. It's quite ridiculous.  Bugger - why does every tiny little thing have to get turned into a three-ring sodding circus by my crapulous fucking hed?  Anyway, I am taking deep breaths and am going to have a nice, long, hot, relaxing bath, get ready calmly and at my own pace, and just pray that no-one tries to hassle me or make things stressy.  I am going out for a happy and long-deserved evening in the pub, to meet up with my best friend, who I haven't seen for FAR too long; and no fucker is going to wreck it for me.  ...and survive.  Just wish Blaq and Glamp were coming too...  *sigh*  .~*~.

      .~*~.  MOOD:.... cautiously optimistic *glances round furtively*  M.A.D Level:.... Moderately sane  MUSIC:.....Heff's NEW redneck/pirate/yokel game.  FELOID:....sensibly keeping out of the way  BUNBUN:.....perked up and nibbling apple    If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and seems to like swimming...     ...you can sometimes safely say that it is likely to be some form of aquatic waterfowl.    Funny thing, intuition.   Recent events have made me highly suspicious of my gut feelings - especially where people are concerned.  The nagging doubts about stuff that pop into my head are pretty much ignored these days; rejected in the face of the blithe assertions and solid reassurances of others.  It's only after the event that I realise I was right to be sceptical all along; and the stronger the feeling, the more horrendously things seem to turn out in the end.   So I'm going with my gut for a while: just to see what happens.  I've made a small start already - some weeks ago: but now I am through giving any people - and anthropomnorphic personifications of abstract concepts - the benefit of the doubt.  I am declaring myself a bullshit-free zone. If I sense that scumbaggery may be lurking behind a disingenuous smirk, I will act accordingly - without waiting for my suspicions to be confirmed by crapulous events.  Cull had a good point - very astute: "The bigger the neon sign saying I AM SAINT IN HUMAN FORM, the more voluminous the maggot content".  Very appropriate in the current situation, too....  I just had it brought forcefully home to me: a leopard only very rarely opts for the pink fluffy stripes instead - and sticks with it.  I guess we live in a universe which prefers the predictability of set patterns and  modus operandi , huh?  .~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~.  Saw 'Sex-tips For Girls' last night. I watched it because it was about 'kink'. Well, 'fetish', actaully; but this is the 'nilla world we're dealing with here.  I really dunno why I persist in watching this stuff - I KNOW it's just gunna make me spit fire. And, apart from the cool guy who comes to your home with decent, high-quality toys, suitable for beginners (and the terminally clueless), and actually SHOWS you how to use 'em, it was exactly as expected.  Worse, actually: we have some bimbo-esque columnist from GQ blithely recommending small garden canes  - sure, if you don't mind splinters in yer ass and a nice "I haven't sat down in a month" type infections, silk scarves, hairbrushes and a variety of other 'found in the kitchen' pervertibles.  I bet casualty departments all around the country are rushed off their feet this weekend.  Yanno, it really  irks  me that, the only time this stuff appears in the mainstream TV medium, it is always knowledge-free assholes, who can't be arsed to do any actual  research , who present it.  Not only do they spout utter bollox; but, in a lot of cases, they spout  dangerous  bollox: like tying people up, hitting 'em with things and doing other random stuff designed to fuck with their heads is somehow a risk-free occupation.  Are there ANY journos out there who actually have a  brain ; or, at least, an eye for the bleedin'  obvious ? Next week, there'll no doubt be some shock-horror expose about how dangerous BDSM is, and what a scandal it is that it isn't illegal...made by the same fucking clueless morons.  Then we always have some couple of sad-sack, middle-aged, boring, brainless and embarassingly parochial "sensual sadist/hobby D/s" types, who are trotted out and held up as examples of the practice.  Usually, their main TV function seems to be to allow the rest of us ( normal  people) to point and laugh at the weird pervy freaks. So they're always highly unattractive, and cluelessly unimaginitive - whilst still managing to be both disingenuous and highly precious talking about their 'art' and the joy it brings them. As some species of 'evidence' of this, you are then subjected to the sight of white, wobbly, trussed up (always female) flesh being half-heartedly flogged by some leathery article that looks like it came out of a christmas cracker (who's holding the cheap flogger he's hitting her with).  Presumably in the name of gender-balance (in case people write in about the brutalization of the middle-class housewife) this is usually followed by some portly, slightly slimy, pink-and-sweaty bloke, eagerly panting in front of the camera. We find him - dressed (desperately inadvisedly) in a small rubber thong, a collar from Ann Summers, and a velvet eye-mask - being led around his suburban shag-pile on a lead. Possibly, as he is made to bark by the scraggy tart - dressed in a too-short leatherette mini-skirt, fishnet stockings, patent stilettos, and a red-and-black-lace-bedecked press-studded corset, that's fighting a losing battle to elevate her wizened spaniels' ears into some approximation of a cleavage - who is holding the other end of the leash.  This is how the 'Nilla world is presented with BDSM?   No wonder they think we're warped...  But, I digress....  The reason I mentioned this TV thing is because last-night's offering presented the most tragically hilarious episode I've seen in a long time.  There was this (quite cute, actually) grrlie, hanging off her living room door, in cuffs; while the cool-bondage-teacher-dude in leather explains to her (rather lunk-headed) partner how properly to weild a flogger without causing her serious damage.  Suddenly, "SubMs" pipes up with:  "...but what if it  hurts ...?"   - .....?    ........!!!?!  Well,   duh  !   I give up, I really do....  *sigh*  .~*~.

      .~*~.  HaHA!!!  Wabbit still alive.  Went into town and bought decorating stuff; so we no longer have baby-shit coloured tiles in the hearth!  I'm just praying we'll be able to re-connect the stove when it's all dry...an awful lot of fire-clay fell out when I moved it...oops!!  Plus, it might have been a good idea to seal the flue before I started painting the tiles. Oh well....the odd cinder and sprinkling of soot will add to the character.  I also made some of the patented wood-cleaner/restorer that an antique dealer told Ma about. I had to guess a bit: I know what goes in it; but none of us remember the proportions. So, after the tiles, I spent the whole evening doing me chair.   It looks fabby; but me and everything else now stink of linseed oil.  Sadly, this also means the whole house's trashed again; but the agent's not coming till 2, so if we get up at a reasonable hour, we should be okay.  In any case, I'm feeling pretty pleased with myself for actually achieving stuff.  Plus, I'd forgotten how mych I enjoy mucking about with paint, chemicals and bits of wood; great sense of satisfaction that a certain Boy had to eat his words when he saw how the chair came up.  Me feeling happy - won't last; but still. 'S good.  Now going to eat Chinese food and toy with the idea of moving the freezer...  .~*~.

FELOID:.... dans la maison de chien   BUNBUN:.....punctured, damp and sorry for himself    Oh Lord....  Remember "well, things  can't  get any worse"...?  *hysterio-maniacal laughter*  Okay, so we had an assassination attempt yesterday. A long-expected one; but traumatic nonetheless: both...no ALL of us have a few extra grey hairs today.  Sitting in study yesterday eve, when peace and Radio 4 interrupted by feloid 'galloping down stairs' noise, followed by kerfuffle in hallway. Rushed out: mad cat-bunny animal thrashing about wildly on rug. I rescued bunny; Heff rescued cat.   Period of panic, reflection, wound-licking, application of warm salt-water and savlon, praying to bunny fairy.  CHRIST knows how George managed to get the bunny-room door open....a fucking great hook is going on it today.  At least the Wabbit didn't die of shock. I took him into our bedroom to sort him out and keep him warm. Poor little bugger scrunched himself right up under my chin and shook for a couple of hours, before relieving himself on the duvet.  How do you get Rabbit-pee out of a feather duvet?  Upshot of this: family outing - with Eoin in the (carefully cleaned and fumigated) cat-carrier -  to the vet this morning; where Eoin had a shot of anti-biotics and a shot of painkiller.  So, blasted Cat has just cost us another £30; and I have to administer liquid meds to bunny for the next five days.  o joy.  Still, on the up-side, vet gave me a leaflet about caring for wabbits - I may soon have a clue.   Albeit only a very small one.  I'm Still a bit wobbly about the whole trust thing. Though Heff and I had a brief chat about it last night - while we were lying in bed inventing revenge-scenarios for ruining the life of Public Enemy No. 1 (who's fault most of the current wobliness, essentially, is).   I guess it's just going to take time for me to get over. Not much else that can be done.  Apart from making sure it doesn't happen again.  I'm not holding my breath, though: purple isn't my colour.  *sigh*   In the mean time, I'm devoting myself to house sorting, party-planning (political nightmare, I forsee), writing, and putting my under-utilised intellect through its paces by thinking up deviously subtle plans for pissing all over the lives of a couple of deserving individuals.  Well, it passes the time...  .~*~.  On the good news front, Shay is out of hospital.    *cheering and bouncing about*  Hope she stays that way.   *hugs to all*  .~*~  PS.

      .~*~.  Well it's bin a pretty crapulous week, all told.   There I was, all bored and wishing for some excitement.   Had some 'excitement'.  No longer bored - au contraire: can't switch my bleedin head off, now.  Feeling insecure, hurt, really, really stupid and angry instead, now - and people just seem pretty pointless and essentially untrustworthy; so I'm back in psycho-hermit mode again.  Achieved this week: bupkiss. Nada, zilch, zip, fuckall, diddley-squat.  Funny, though, I'm much more on top of stuff. I guess the feeling of fatalistic bleakness takes away even the will to prevaricate: I'm kinda living inside my own boiling head while the rest of me operates on auto-pilot.  Tomorrow's therapy is looming like a a falling anvil: can't go out and am fighting waves of panic and despair.  So I guess that's another therapy-free week. Not sure there's much of a point to it, anyway - the misery and stress it causes just makes things worse.  I'm just not sure why I'm still here, or what the hell will happen in the future: I feel like I'm standing on a melting ice-flow.  'Part from that, life's pretty damn good: utterly hopeless and futile, of course; but still....  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Gah....oogy day.  It's 4.21am and I promised myself I'd be in bed by 1....  Heff's got a migraine that won't seem to go away. It kinda started after he et the terrible-smelling pot-noodle last night....and he looked like death warmed over this morning (when I surfaced enough to focus). So I put him back to bed with some of my pills. He woke up at various points; but didn't seem to be getting much better.   At midnight, he was still feeling terrible; but I fed him shreddies (a few; under protest) and some more pills, gave him a big cuddle, moved all my stuff into the spare room (with Eoin: o joy), and left him reading Terry Pratchet by the fairy-lights.   Yes, we have fairy lights over our bed - what of it??   He's sleeping now. I just hope he's okay tomorrow - he's depressed enough about it today.  I totally failed to make it down to the co-op: started HV in the hall - twice. I think it's because I HAD to go: it was a big deal. I couldn't even go into town coz we have no cash in the house.  So I monged about online most of the day - couldn't make any noise, so couldn't do much of any use. I did IM with Lisa for a bit - which was fabulous as I've not chatted to her for so long. She's great: listening her go all gooey and in lurve was cool. And she sent me a couple of pix - they made my toes curl; but for her, all the blood and bruises are fantastic. He phones her three times a day from work; she's moving in the autumn; and I hear the faint clang of bells in the distance...  All I gotta do now is make her visit before she's lost forever to some blerk...  Apart from that it's bin a bit of a tough day: too much time to think.   I hate it when the house is quiet: brings out all the monsters.  I'm a bit wary of them since the 'gargoyle' incident the other night: and I am now terrified of running out of meds.  All this oogy shite kept flitting across my brane all day - seemingly at random. One of the buggers in there's obviously bin rifling the archives again and slingign out random incidents from the 'do not open ever again' file.  *sigh*  I just keep telling myself: "two steps forward; one step back: net GAIN of one step".    I'm thinking of getting it printed on red card and laminated.  Didn't do any therapy this week; and I've just this second realised that I have now totally run out of meds... (not to mention catfood, milk, bread, coffee....)    HAVE to go into town tomorrow - if only to get meds. Pray god the script is ready. Plus, I have to pay the council their pound of flesh.   I really don't wanna have to call in the cavalry...but I am psyching mtyself up to admit defeat if I have to.   I won't have to, though.  Dad's going to the docs tomorrow (er..today). He told me on the phone on Saturday that he's going to find out how long he'd have if he came off all his meds. He says they're making his life a misery.  This was hard to hear: he has high blood-pressure, high cholestrol, diabetes - in addition to  malignant melanoma - the latest of which to surface he is refusing to have removed (on the basis that it will take 15 years to kill him and he doesn't reckon he has that long left).  I have been trying to wrap my head around all this change that's taken place over the last couple of years; the extent to which the family I used to have totally fell apart in the space of a few weeks four years ago; and the rate at which the wreckage has been circling the drain ever since.    I can't absorb this - how fast it happened. I'm left with odd images, pictures that tear at me every time they pop up in my head.   Not all of them have happened yet, either.  Out of everything I have ever had in my life, the only thing that has been constant and seemed in any way permanent, is Dad. I honestly can't imagine how my life would be without him around.  I have this vague image of it: I just don't want to bring it into any clearer focus; and this latest is forcing me to.  So my (selfish) instinct is to talk him out of it as hard as I can; but, realistically, I couldn't.  Besides, I can kinda understand his POV: better a short, happy, time than a long miserable one.   In any case, I guess I have to respect whatever decision he makes and support him as best I can. Sure as Hell no-one else will - starting with Ma.  Just that I seem to have been surrounded by death for so long now - and deaths of people I love - that have caused the collapse of my world so utterly - that I'm not sure I could deal with that.  I'm too young to lose my father.  I know lots of people do/have; I know lots of people don't get to HAVE a father at all - let alone one as totally wonderful as mine; but, really, that makes no difference, does it: when it's YOUR father?  I mean, I CAN  LIVE  without him: in an obscure kind of way, he's the one who made it possible for me to learn to be independent in the first place.  I just don't WANT to - with every single molecule of everything that I am.  It's the only death that causes me real terror.  Even the thought of my own death isn't as frightening - though I am scared of being in pain and alone at the end.   Isn't everyone?   In a funny kind of way, having been so close to death, and having spent so much time thinking about my own death - how to bring it about, and how to know when the time is right, the consequences for other people - over the last year, I'm almost  comfortable  with the idea.   It's kind of encouraging to know that, if things really do get  too  hard, there's an out; a decision I can make; something I can do.  So I guess I understand Dad's decision - if that's the one he makes; and I HAVE to do my best to support him in it.  Trouble with everyone  else's  death, tho, is that there IS no control: it just has to be borne.   I'm not sure I could bear Dad's - though, of course, it's likely that I will have to - sooner or later.  Just feels at the moment like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop: there's that sense of eerie silence and stillness that you get just before something truly awe-inspiringly catastrophic happens...  ....bleurgh....sorry for the morbid rantings....   'S late: gunna go and find summat absorbing to read and go to bed.  Though of course, I don't wanna: Heffy isn't in it.  *sigh*   .

      .~*~.  Kaaaay....so the renovation project has been temprarily abandoned, till after the party.    Skirting-boards are a bastard to glue to no plaster, as it turns out.   Who knew?  On the up side, it's been interesting watching the three near-terminal net-nerds, who now constitute the residents of  "la Mauvais Maison Flop de Sasha" , trying to cope without PC/net access for the last week.  One caved after 48hrs and set up an  ad hoc  PC, for the sole purpose of killing things, in the bedroom - where it fucks with the telly, makes a shitload of noise, and further buggers his back to use it as he has to sit on the bed sideways and squint at the screen from a funny angle; one just calmly set up a PC  sans  net access at home, while stooping to 'paying for it', by the half-hour, at some seedy, darkened, degraded venue in the town; and the other one developed a fixation for hot-air stripping every piece of painted wood in the house while listening to Sad Old Goth music.  You guess which is which.  It's kinda cool having the two new house-slaves living here. Compared to previous specimens of my experience, they are surprisingly well house-broken, civilised and, as a bonus, endlessly entertaining. One of them is a bit noisy; but hell, you can't have everything - and it also turns out, usefully, to be a bit of a dab-hand with a scraper.   I hear with other things, too: but I couldn't possibly venture to comment.   Anyway, from the lofty solitude of my bed,  "la Mauvais Maison Flop de Sasha"  seems to be running along reasonably painlessly: it's non-stop Caberet round here. Though somewhat lacking in the 'erotic' bits, I have to say - having spent a whole evening unavoidably viewing Blaq's screensaver.  Honestly, I was underwhelmed; in places, frankly revolted.   That boi has problems.   (Like we didn't know this)  I find myself, however, forced to let him off as he came home from work the other day with a battery-operated, ceiling-suspendable, flying bat - that really flies, as a present for me.    [reputation-ruining audience-participation moment]He's so sweet! all together now: aaaaaaaaaaahhh!!! [/reputation-ruining audience-participation moment]  Sadly, though, it seems that there is nowhere in my house with a sufficiently capacious stretch of ceiling to allow me actually to operate said plastic mammalian wonder.   Who came up with this bright idea of putting bloody light-fillings right in the middle of the bleedin ceiling, anyway?  Whoever it was, they obviously never got given a flying bat.  Their loss.    In other news, the casualty list is rising: latest addition is my ever-supportive mother, who seems to be waiting for me to apologise to her for taking offence at her latest indefensible act of insensitivity, cruelty and selfishness.  Un- (to borrow a quote) fucking-lucky.  I don't really expect understanding, nor support - beyond the purely practical (which, in any case, I get to pay for in guilt-trips); but I DO expect - positively DEMAND, at this stage - that she have sufficient wit, tact and empathy not to go out of her way to make things actually  worse .  Current performance analysis leads me to the conclusion that were I to break my leg, upon hearing the news, my Mother would march up to me, stamp on the injured limb, coldly offer a few choice observations upon the stupidity of engineering the situation simply for 'attention', and leave in an affronted manner, to announce to my Father that everything is fine: I'm just making the whole thing up.  I would then be left to fester until I developed the 'maturity' and 'humility' to offer her an abject apology for putting her through yet more worry and trouble, and for having the temerity to make such a fuss in the first place.  Currently, Gran is hinting that I should ring her and 'make up' - on the basis that 'She doesn't mean it' (an assertion of which I see no evidence whatsoever), she 'just worries about' me (ditto), and that she 'loves' me 'to bits'.  Funny: must be some strange, new, definition of the word 'loves' I have yet to discover...?   I offered an olive branch to the previous occupant of the shit-list top spot; but it was disdainfully rejected - with chillingly restrained politeness.  *shrugs*  Some people   LIKE   having a bug up their arse, it seems.   Probably reassures them that there's two-way traffic in at least  ONE  area of their lives...  Not fooling anyone, mind.  And now, as they say, we have a   NEW!   number one.   Or number two.   (Depending upon your preference, idiom-wise.)  Sad that it turned out to be a 'doting' parent; but there you go. As has been forcefully pointed out to me recently: a line has to be drawn somewhere.   So  what  if my Magic Marker has nearly run out of ink?   I've been going on about having a huge clearout, and chucking away all the extraneous rubbish I've collected over the years, for   ages  : just seems like it's turned out to be a bit more thorough and wide-ranging a clearout than I had expected.  In other other news - Heff has buggered his back: it's official.   Mostly, I reckon the permanent pain is the result of his appalling posture; but (and the Doctor concurs in this) I am forced to conclude that the big ladder falling on him  definitely  hasn't helped.  Still, I was relieved to see him taking it all seriously enough that he positively  RUSHED  to see a doctor - a mere   three weeks   after the aforementioned accident occurred.   Equally encouragingly, he hardly tried to wriggle out of it - by asserting that they wouldn't do anything, and it was a complete waste of time going, and that all doctors were shite anyway, and they would just poke at it and send him home, and not do anything about it at all, and as it was now 4.30 they'd be closed now anyway -  at all ...I really didn't have to ambush him in the shower and frogmarch him down there at boot-point very much, either - as you can tell.  So, yes; as if there weren't entertainment aplenty already, Heff is now taking declofenac and co-codamol.  LOTS of co-codamol.  4000 (yes, that's  thousand ) milligrammes  a  day   lots.   He's stoned quite a lot of the time ( quelle surprise ); but it's easy to see what an  horrific  effect the constant pain must have been having on him: now he's out of his tree and in no pain at all, not only has he ceased to be the argumentative, awkward, miserable, snappy, mopey, flaky, angry (starting to sound like Dwarves, again) bastard we've all come to know and....know, he's also got Legion up and running again.  This is, if you will pardon the expression, a double-edged sword.  Okay, so fun  and abandon is being had in bucketloads; but sod all else is getting done - due to him being knackered; and me being fucked out of my head (quite literally) and in various forms of extreme, but interesting, agony for quite a lot of the time since he got his prescription filled...  Hence the retreat from panic, anxiety and orbit-achieving-lid-blowing events, in favour of the 'oh sod it' school of decorating, organisation and party preparation.  As approaches go, for  me , this is......unusual. And....interesting. I guess...  But I'm still convinced that only four people will turn up on Saturday, that it will rain, that there will be no ice and no hot water, and that some major trauma/fight/unpleasantness will occur, such that I spend my  actual  Birthday sobbing/traumatised/feeling like shit/furious/homicidal/suicidal.  Oh well.....why change the habits of a lifetime?  As I have remarked previously: at least, as a dedicated and creative pessimist, I am only ever   pleasantly   surprised...   Thus far, at least.  *checks nervously behind to see who's listening*  .~*~.

      Yup, it's Sunday again....doesn't the time just whizz by?  Must be all this fun I'm having...  Still, despite having spent all of yesterday in the pub, I'm feeling pretty good. The sun's out, the little birdies are coughing rythmically in the trees, the cat is slumbering peacefully on top of his flooring-box (except when he slides off and wakes up suddenly, with his "wha- where am I? Whatthefuckisgoingon??? face on), the grass is less than six inches high, thus no elephants can hide in it.  I also don't have the hangover I deserve; though Heff is still asleep and the weemadscot has yet to put in an appearance either.  It's all Jo's fault: yay Jo!! He survived. I'm really impressed. It was good, though.  After we'd met up with him, we pretty much decided to keep going with the whole 'pub' thing and, after he fle...uh...went home, we relocated operations to The Whores.  Saw a few people I kinda lurve and chatted to them intermittantly - though, really, the place was ded. Didn't stop the new barman from trying to overchrge Dave and Nigel £5, though. They calledf in the management - and won. So they're gunna be drinking vodka and coke with added wee from now on, then. Eventually, came the hour, they kicked us out and we went back to Dave's.  Dave has 'Facist Murdering Fuckwit' Top Trumps (he's like that: probably cost him a small fortune on eBay), so we made Heather DJ while we tried to wipe one another out. I found myself bemoaning that Vlad the Impaler hadn't actually managed to wipe out a few more people over a longer reign of terror - though he had the highest score for 'Creative Cruelty'. Annoyingly, Dave kept winning on the - historically highly spurious - basis that Oliver Cromwell did four invasions. Dave's like a little kid - he beat Heff, with much glee; but I totally whooped his scrawny little arse and got to crow gracelessly for 5 minutes.   Right mental attitude, see: I have no trouble getting inside the head of a fascist dictator.   Odd, that....  It was good to see the bum-hed again, though he's not very well, so I did a wee bit of gentle nagging - which, of course, he will utterly ignore. In true Dave stylee.   It's been a while. Too long: I miss the little fucker when he's not around.  Trouble is, thought I see him out sometimes, he's different when he's socialising. He's kinda his public, "Cradle Dave" persona - not 'my' Dave at all. I much prefer seeing him when it's just him and me: we can talk and mong about and be relaxed. I never feel relaxed around him in public - unless he's utterly wasted; but that's not conducive to very much of anything, really. 'Cept holding him up; making sure he doesn't trip over the kerb, pick up underage totty or Trouble; and persuading him that he doesn't REALLY wanna end up in the gutter for the night  Ho hum.  It was fantastic to get out of  "Mauvais Maison Flop de Sasha"  for a while, too - though still traumatic to wake up to find all the shite still there this morning. Not one single mug, cup, or glass that I own is clean - and that's just the  peripheral  chaos: I despair of having the place ready for the damn party.   I'm feeling somewhat overwhelmed by it all, to be honest: it seems it's all down to me; and Dee is allegedly coming next week -  expecting everything current to be pretty-much finished.  Fat chance: haven't even mopped the new floor (fabulous: no fuckkin horrible beige CARPET!!) or put back the furniture already down here, yet.   I did try: took me two-anna-half hours to carefully hoover up all the dust and debris (even had to hoover the dining-room walls!!); but, when I tried moving the hall-stand on my own I scratched the bleedin floor, didn't I? So I had a bit of a paddy, ranted silently in my head for a bit; than spent the rest of the day monging about online.  Ooooh, George just slid off the box again. He's left a great string of drool down it where he slipped, and is looking at me in that 'I  totally   MEANT  to do that' way that only feloids can achieve.  He's a nidiot. Lots of nidiots round here - starting with me.  Why the stupid little fucker doesn't sleep INSIDE the damn box, I don't know. I wrote a big warning on it in Magic Marker, so he didn't get stood on and squashed, when he was cowering in it on Wednesday. He was hiding from the jigsaw: he doesn't like the noise (prolly coz, to him, it sounds like a big hoover - his arch-Nemesis).  Ah well...  It's 2.12, and looking like Heff's still feeling oogi. I think he's got a virus - or a dose of alcohol poisoning, coupled with a sore throat from talking all day yesterday. I was hoping he might do a bit of shopping - especially ice!! I miss ice.  Better go do summat, I guess: make coffee; watch old episodes of 'Friends' and wait for The OC to come on; then figure out what I'm gunna feed everybody, I guess.  Gotta get act together, though: Nick moves in on 20th; and, right now, there's not even floorspace in the living-room to put his bed...  *panics quietly*  .

      .~*~.     The insanity continues....    Hahahahahaaaaaaaaaaa!!  I've seen Glampers in full NBC kit - inc Gasmask and helmet.  She's even scarier dressed in camouflage gear.  I think she should join the army for real!!  Apart from that, no flooring delivered Friday: old stuff due to be picked up tomorrow.  House in terminal chaos; but fings getting done slowly.  Blaq moves in on 20th - hope we have somewhere to put him by then. Especially since the Cupboard-under-the-stairs is full of decorating stuff.  Still hasn't stopped raining for long enough to mow the bleedin lawn: I fucked it up by buying a strimmer on Thursday.  I think Heff is getting a bit hysterical: the FULL horror of the situation is only just beginning to sink in. Have a look at his blog - encapsulates the situation succinctly, if a little terrifyingly. He's not exaggerating even slightly.  I am planning to go into business wi the ITSC, developing houses and selling them six months of the year.  Now might, I suspect, finally be the time to save me from myself by actually putting that bullet in the back of my hed I'm always going on about.  It's for my own good.  ^_^   .~*~.

      .~*~.     MADNESS!!    Okay, so I've managed to put off clearing the back bedroom, sorting all the boxes and reorganising the junk till tody.  It's essential now: we got Dad coming over to 'help us' put the floor down in the downstairs rooms tomorrow. If we don't sort it all out, we can't move the furniture out...  So, we got up BRIGHT and EARLY this morning....having gone to bed SOBER and at a REASONABLE HOUR last night; so we were all BRIGHT-EYED, full of boundy ENERGY, CLEAR HEADED, and generally RARING TO GO - didn't we??  Like fuck.  *sigh*  Dee turned up just after midnight; we chatted, I got to bed by 1.   Heff and the wee scots nutter sat up drinking red wine, howling with hilarity, and playing 'flip for the bed', till gone four...Heff looked like he'd been denuding the virgin population again: nice reddy-purple lips, tongue and teeth. Mmmmmmmmmmmm, sexi....(not)  So we WERE asleep by six; woke up at noon, had breakfast. No one else was stirring, so we crawled back into bed to keep warm and watch telly. Heff developed a hangover. Then he decided that a shag-fest would be a good idea. Then we fell asleep, all blissed out.  4pm.  Woke with a start.  Inhaled sugar and fluid.  Heff went to the shop.   I drank coffee and watched The Really Wild Show in a valiant attempt to wake up.  We started actually DOING stuff around 5.30.  It's now 9.22 and we've stopped for dinner (pizza, helpfully delivered by the nice man from the Kebab shop).  The whole of the upstairs is trashed; but progress is being made - as well as lots of space.  Elf-boi just arrived: he will be putting stuff in the loft as soon as he's finished his pizza. He doesn't know this yet.  >:-D  It will be done.  I foresee very little sleep, though.  Hope Dad isn't planning on getting here too early tomorrow....  Organisation: qu'est-ce que c'est?  *howls maniacally*  Oh yeah: in other news: the fridge has now GONE!!!!  whoop-de-do!!  And *glances round 'case Fate's lis'nin'* looks like Heavvah and co will soon be living a few houses down on the other side of the road!!!  *does happi likkle dance of manic glee*  Oh well....bang goes the neighbourhood!!

      .~*~.  What   is   this "glass half empty" shit, anyway?  How can an intelligent person not know that waiting for everything to fall apart, and committing nothing to anything because of it, just makes it inevitable that the thing will end?  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy: self-destructive cynical fatality is a form of monumental selfishness; and a truly pitiful excuse not to try anything, not to give anything a serious go - because, heaven forefend, you might turn out to be wrong about something.   Is it  so  important to be right all the time? To be able to affect the impressive pose of wearily hopeless prescience and push everyone else away, sneering at them for their fallibility, their mistakes and the fact that they try and fail?   Is it   so   important that it's worth throwing away with both hands anything good, pure, positive of hopeful that comes your way? To make things happen just so you can destroy them and be able to say 'I knew it all along'?  Are you, really and truly,  that  scared of failure, that it is better not to try for success, not to  give  anything, on the offchance that happiness might be the result? Are you so weak that you are unable to cede some of the power to determine the future to someone else and trust, for once, that they're not out to fuck you over?  You see the thing is, in life,  nothing  is forever.   Everything ends -  everything .   One day you will die: is that any reason to kill yourself now and save yourself the bother of waiting for it to happen? Or to sit out life with a listless, scowling, aloof, fatalism - just  so you can say 'see? I told you it would all end in shit' on your deathbed?  The art of life is to make the most of what you  have .  To grab onto   every single    opportunity for happiness that ever comes your way and to hang onto it with both hands - no matter how long or short a time it lasts. The point is to take what you  can  get with gratitude: not to bemoan endlessly what you don't have, may never have, or may lose.  Trouble is life.  Life is  mostly  trouble, pain, misery, struggle.  That's what life   is  .  But not  totally .   There are good bits, too - if you are paying attention; and ready to see and accept them for what they are, rather than reject them for what they're not.  There will always be more shit than roses; but you need the shit to make the roses grow; you need the stench so you can appreciate the fragrance when the roses finally bloom; you have to have the darkness so that, when the day finally comes, you can tell the difference between darkness and standing in the light.   You have to look after the roses, or they will die: you will lose them; and the garden; and the light. However brief the day, it's worth the darkness; and if you look for it, and work for it, another one will come along anyway.  You can't just cower in the garden with your eyes closed, breathing through your mouth, and scream that it'll just be dark soon, the stench will return and the shit will smother the flowers.  What's the point in that?   Not only is it pointless, it's   stupid  .   It's juvenile like putting your hands over your ears and singing so you don't have to hear something you don't want to. It's like asking for a bike for christmas then throwing it out because it's not  quite  the shade of red you wanted. It's like not opening your bank statements in the hope that your salary will somehow have increased coz you didn't look.   It's the greatest form of monumental stupidity that exists: a failure to grasp that   THIS IS ALL THERE IS  .   There's nothing else coming unless  you  make it happen.   You're nothing special; the laws of the universe will not conspire to change because of you.   You will not suddenly be reprieved at the last minute, and be allowed to go 'round again coz you realise, too late, that you fucked up your own life all by yourself because you never had the courage to take the risk of actually living it.  Nothing's perfect.   Truly: there is  nothing  in life that will be without some catch, drawback, downside, cost. Nothing is pure, nothing is free, nothing is certain.  If you simply stand aloft, seeing only the darkness and the shit, counting the cost without understanding the value, you are wasting your life. There's so much stuff out there to be explored and experienced - if you can but see it.   You have to grab it; you really do: thorns, nettles, sewage and all. You have to  fight  to get at those small moments of joy, contentment and fulfillment - and fight long and hard: they don't just float to the surface of their own accord, and wait to be picked up in a rare moment when you happen to glance up. You won't always succeed, either; but you have to  keep  fighting, keep trying to find them for yourself, to make them happen, to see them coming and run towards them.   You can't do this from  outside ; you can't stand aloof and wait for life to come to you, despite your outward certainty that it's none of it worth a damn anyway. You have to get down in the dirt, dig with your hands, get filthy; you have to take the risk of committing to something, to putting your heart and soul into it, knowing that you are risking everything - and possibly risking everything for nothing; but being alright with that.   You have to be prepared to take the risk.   Otherwise you will never find anything of worth; will never do anything of worth, never be anything of worth - of worth to you, at least. And you will never grow and learn anything of worth either: just carry on seeing the world and it's inhabitants through the same dark veil of your own black propaganda.. I  know  you could never be happy with that.  Time is getting short, though: you have to do something about it NOW.   Life is very, very short.   It's a cliche, so no-one stops to think about what it really means; or bothers to take it seriously.  But it's terrifyingly true - it really is.   Life is so short that suddenly, I find I'm 37: half-way through mine already; and I feel like I've hardly had time to draw breath and look around me yet.    There isn't  time  to dip your toe into the water, complain about the cold, then stand and think about immersing a whole foot - maybe - and only when it gets a bit warmer.  The saddest thing about all this is that you   will   only realise the terrible thing you've done, all that you're throwing away; and recognise the things you could have had and been happy with, when it's too late to salvage anything but bitterness, regret and some kind of desparate, regretful, wisdom.  I say this to you, pleading that you understand:  You have a glass half full of  life .   You see only that it is half empty, so you refuse to drink.   Don't wait 'till the rest of it has evaporated to realise it was, in fact, half full: waiting for you to drink, and more than sufficient to quench your thirst.  Please, please don't do this. For your own sake; if not for us both.  I love you.   .~*~.

Oh dear....I'd have preferred Johnny Depp - but I s'pose the extended life and being able to turn myself into a bat kinda makes up for it.  ^V-V^  In   other   news, Heff gave me a collar last night - complete with champagne, tears and tissues.   Given that I am usually squicked to the core by any kind of sentiment or overblown display of emotion, he got the thing  exactly  right: I was moved beyond words.   For someone who claims not to understand a lot of the 'whole relationship stuff', he did a pretty damn good impression of a mature, sincere, caring, thoughtful and emotionally literate person, able to share both his vulnerability and his strength. I've never met anyone quite like him before and I feel very lucky that he's part of my life: I love him so much.  And now I am his property.  I am owned and collared.  I never thought, in my wildest flights of ridiculous fantasy, that   I   would ever be writing   that  .  It should be a huge mental and emotional adjustment; and, to an extent, I suppose it is. It's going to be challenging, and hard work living up to it; but I have always liked to challenge myself. Besides which, this just feels   right  .   I've always known that this is what Heff wanted us to work towards; but my initial reaction was one of ridicule bordering on scorn. I couldn't see it - not   ME  .   However, Heff never pushed, never made it any kind of condition, never made me feel pressured or obligated.  He's given me the space and time I needed to think about it, see the point and the benefits, and to analyse my own feelings on the subject as they have changed over time. He's waited so patiently for me to be sure what I want; talked and negotiated and suggested and tested me until I am certain it's the commitment that we BOTH want, in the form that will work for us.   The thing about ownership over being a 'sub', or a 'slavey', is that I get to be a fuckpuppet rather than a servant. Let's face it, I would make a  very  bad 24/7 sub: I'm neither humble nor servile; and I would resent not being allowed to use my brain in an independent, self determining, way.    Luckily, Heff came to the conclusion, way before he met me, that he's not especially enamoured of the typical 'twue' subby types. He prefers people who can think for themselves and don't need his permission to fart or cough; and don't need him to sort out their lives as well as control them. One of the things that first attracted me was that he shared my attitude re. submissives: where's the challenge in being a dominant when grovelling submission is offered on a plate; and trust and respect are automatic, rather than earned?  So he's quite happy with me remaining largely stroppy, controlling, demanding, critical, nasty, devious, opinionated and willful for a lot of the time - even, on occasion, towards   him   (only now he gets to have his  rewengay  when he's in command!)  Besides, I don't think  either  of us could keep a straight face if he was to make me crawl towards him on my knees every morning, carrying the little pink bag containing his daily dose of gummi-bear-vitamins in my teeth...  ...and this is a real, deadly serious, endeavour for both of us.   We may well poke fun; but it represents a true, permanent, commitment to each another: a genuine attempt to build the kind of relationship we want.  I think we're making huge progress: it feels good that, finally, (and quite suddenly - but not without an enormous amount of work and effort over a short period of time) things are on an even keel between us. We know where we are, and where we're going; and we're so happy with one-another.  Okay - mushy stuff over - you may now employ the bucket and the wetwipes at the back of the room...  m== ==m  .~*~.

        ==**Start Transmission**==     Location:  SSS  Mauvais Maison     Crew:   Humanoid  - 4;  Feloid  - 1;  Rodentiae  - 2;  Micro-aquatic  - 15 (est.) and increasing.  [NB.Remainder of crew comprises various insectoid, synthetic and artificial life-forms of an indefinite number.]   =Entry Begins=   Strange things are afoot onboard ship. I am increasingly concerned for the welfare of the crew.  The fist mate, invisible during daylight hours, can often be heard making strange clicking and grunting noises well into the wee small hours. Surprising her a few nights ago, I could not help but notice that the weird light from the communications array reflected strangely off her twisted features in a way that makes her look truly alien.  I am beginning to wonder if she is some kind of enemy agent: a fifth columnist whose nocturnal activities are in fact a cover to conceal repeated attempts to contact her home planet and pass on sensitive information about the mission.  I am also suspicious that she may have psyco-telekenetic abilities: it could be that, while I sleep, she is able to pluck thoughts from my mind - thus discovering the TRUE purpose of the voyage.  As yet, she has said nothing; but I have determined to keep a close eye on her activities in the future.  In public, of course, I concur with the Captain: it's the malign influence of the BB virus - daily exposure to which has a tendency to make her strangely excitable, loud and, frankly, quite freaky.  The Tech officer is too off his head on medication to know  what  is going on - ever since the portable docking system fell on him while he was attempting to retrieve emergency supplies from the long-neglected upper decks of the ship.  Today we visited a medical station on the outer Galaxy to access treatment for this. I was not unaware of the disappointment on his face when no further psychotropic substances were offered to distract him from the pain. Instead, he was advised to spend more of his time flexing his skeletal cortex and gently waving his pseudopodia in the air.  Sadly, this will prevent him from spending long hours plugged into the ship's central communications and entertainment interface. Happily, though, it seems unlikely to affect his duties as tech maintenance engineer, uniform sanitation operative and Ship's steward - especially since the cutting edge medico-tech unit assigned to his case prescribed 'moving about and exercising' as a part-solution to his current difficulty.   In any event, he is now on hourly remedial duties; and will be on fatigues if detected plugging into the CCEI for extended periods of time.  For myself, I have realised that the assortment of timezones occupied by different members of the crew does not promote effective on-board communication; and, in fact, it may even be damaging the mission objectives overall. Just as seriously, it is fostering the belief of each that the others spend most of their time engaged in anti-social hibernation, unconscious brain revitalisation, and televisual exploration of other galaxies and planents for the purpose of entertainment.   (Except for the Captain, who spends most of his waking hours foraging off-world).  This is far from the case: simply that the crew occupy different time-zones; thus seldom interact except in passing and are often unaware of maintanance and repairs conducted at times when they are logged off the social interface and individual monitoring system.  Nonetheless, I have decided that, as the Ranking Officer, it is my job to make myself available to the crew more often.  Thus, I have decided that some kind of technological device must be adopted to facilitate this. To this end, I am in the process of having an amazing new innovation - the 'Po-wyst Iyt Nowyte' - lovingly inscribed with the information "I am in here sewing and/or watching Telly; you may come in and visit me if you like".  The idea is that I will then have the inscribed 'PIN' (as they are being called by the less sentient members of The Acadamy) affixed to the door of my cabin on the upper decks, thereby encouraging the crew to think of it - and me - as a thriving and exciting centre for communication, relaxation and enjoyment.  I am sure this innovation will make a considerable difference to morale on board, and mark a new era of hilarity for all concerned.  This will, I hope, be of particular benefit and utility to the Captain.  Ah yes, the Captain.   I am a little concerned about the Captain: not only has he segregated himself from the rest of the ship - by means of some blood-soaked relic he unearthed in an Ungodly market he visited in the course of his foraging duties - but he seems to be suffering from delusions again.  I have yet to establish whether this is the result of insufficient medication, a form of space sickness, a new viral species he contracted while off-world, or a psycho-emotional disorder fostered by insufficient exposure to the synthetic life-form with which he has been consulting - and with which he seems to have formed some kind of strong socio-psychological bond.  For myself, I believe he would benefit immensely from exploring at least some parts of the immediate galaxy accompanied by his fellow crew-members (perhaps only the humanoid ones; as, unfortunately, almost all the other species we have encountered on our voyage so far have a distaste - bordering on extreme, occasionally violent, hostility - towards the Rodentiae onboard). I would also recommend that, whilst on these short exploratory tours, the Captain make some effort to ingest reasonably large quantities of Universal Muscle Relaxant, as is traditional in certain areas and cultures of the Galaxy.   In any case, I am afraid the Captain's situation is becoming grave: every day he submerges himself deeper and deeper in this fictional Universe inside his head.   He still insists upon clinging to a wide range of erroneous beliefs which, in the face of all the evidence to the contrary, lead him to behave as though he were living, in a state of some deprivation, in a small, densely populated accommodation unit, situated in some mythical small-town, on a - so far unlocatable - planetoid called "Sufuk".  It's bizarre, I know - but true; and I am forced to admit that I begin to despair of his recovery.  Sadly, it appears that the Captain has now gone irrevocably insane.  My fears are now for the remainder of the crew; especially since the First Officer is beginning to show signs of the same delusional disorder.  All I can do is watch, wait - and lock myself away from them for as much time as possible so I don't catch it too.  Admiral Out.   =entry ends=    =*Additional*=    The Captain and the First Officer have just returned from a joint foraging expedition to the centre of the Galaxy we are currently exploring.  I am now certain of my suspicions -  to wit.  that the First Officer is both an alien and showing symptoms of a similar disorder to that contracted by the Captain.  Having disembarked from the shuttle that returned them to the ship, she proceeded to a lewd exhibition of over-familiarity I can only describe as 'rubbing her damp kebab on me'.  It was quite a  horrible  experience.  I await further developments with an increasing sense of d00m...  =*Additional ends*=    ==**Transmission Terminated 17.58**==

      .~*~.  It appears that I have the power to create life where none existed before...  This is a bit of a kicker - I guess I should have known, really; but still. It's not the kind of thing one tends to experiment with naturally, is it?  So (I hear you cry) how do you do this, Oh Slasha, Goddess of The Great Flat Wasteland, of The Church of The Homicidal Chainsaw of Doom?  Well, it happened like this....  Due to certain unforseen circumstances, my ineffable attention being diverted elsewhere, I accidentally neglected - severely - the nutritional reqirements of certain of my subject Universes.   Unsurprisingly, they all died - well, all but one bloody great individual, anyway.   My Chief Accolyte, I assume.  Anyway, eventually circumstances changed; and I realised my neglect - in my omniscient wisdom; and, not wanting to be left without even a Chief Accolyte to serve me in this particular Universe, in My Merciful Goodness, I decided to rectify the situation.  And Behold!! Did the endless masses of the faithful re-incarnate, apparently...uh...spontaneously, at my desire, such that their number is now legion!!  Yup.  'S true.  There are hundreds of the little buggers now.  They're quite small at the moment; but, basking in the light of My munificent attention, they're growing like bastards!  I am forced to confess, however, that, omniscience aside and all, I have no idea exactly   why   - given that, previously, there were only rotting corpses and, as I say, my hulking greate Chief Accolyte.  So I can only explain it as a manifestation of my Will, and my regret at having (temporarily) forsaken My Faithfull, that created the new life.  Go me!  Am I a cool and froody Goddess, or what?  Plus, I never realised that giving life would be as cool and satisfying, to the ego of the Deity, as the more usual entertaining pass-time -  to wit . Taking It Away With Extreme Prejudice and Lots of Mess, Agony and Screaming.  Who knew?  And I  like  this newfound power. It's exceptionally cool to be able to create life outta nuffink.  I may even consider becoming a Benevolent Omnipotent Creator Deity, now.   (Well, part-time, at least.)  I totally ROCK - as it turns out!!  How cool is that??   m==(@'_'@)==m   (Jeez, who knew that Sea Monkeys would be   such fun  ?!!)   .~*~.

      .~*~.  Right, so Heff and I have been revisiting a few relationship issues, lately. So, I came up with this cunning plan to try and make things go a bit more smoothly. It's a FANTASTIC plan, I'm really excited, and so is Heff.  Heff got so excited about it yesterday that he decided to start straight away.  I was going to spend today in town, doing a bit of shopping and a load of desultory wandering about.  Sadly, I am so battered, sore and aching from Heff's 'enthusiasm' for experimental plan implementation last night that I find myself, instead, staying in bed swallowing Ibuprofen and wincing or squeaking every time I move.  I laugh....  (Well, I  would ; but it hurts)  Me verrrr happi! >:-D  m=(>o  In other news, my mother pulled another of her 'sensitive' little stunts yesterday.   God, that woman's gob should carry a health warning.   I think there must be some kinda loose connection in her head that randomly disconnects her brane from her vocal cords, allowing them a dangerous level of autonomy.  I was a bit surprised - given my family's legendary ignorance of the concept of apologising - to get a sheepish call from my Pa this morning telling me to check my mail coz Ma had mailed me. He went on to virtually beg me to reply: he was in the village at the time, having volunteered to go and buy bread as an excuse to escape from her VILE mood for a few minutes.  So, yes: I have written proof that my mother has been persuaded of the benefits of offering an apology when she fucks up - rather than the usual strategy she employs: sulking, being nasty and trying to justify the unjustifiable - while attempting to persuade me it was all my fault anyway.  *sigh*  Still,  detente  has been achieved once again.  For the time being, at least.  m=[o_o]=m  I am now going back to bed to wait anxiously for Heff to come home.   Anxiously because I'm praying his little jaunt will have sapped him of sufficient energy that he won't feel the need to expend any more on me.  For once, I will be deliriously happy if he spends the whole day in front of the PC gaming.  (But don't tell him I said that, okay?)  Well, until I feel a bit better, anyway...   .~*~.

      .~*~.    Sod!!!     Went to Pin'ead's BBQ...well, briefly.  I lost track of time completely, then Heff didn't order the cab when I told him to, so I spent a further hour fannying about in the bathroom and otherwise having a cow, then Pin'ead phoned to see where we were, then I realised it was 10 o'clock, then I had another bovine offspring, then Heff called a cab and we got there about half-past ten.  They'd eaten already - which was just as well, as Heff forgot the thousand million hamburgers he'd defrosted to take with us.  There was lots of bread; I talked to Pin'ead; admired his home improvements; exchanged a couple of monosyllables with Gareth; made Nolan bring me tequila; remembered why I stopped drinking tequila (it's VILE); watched Pin'ead's nursie friends smearing each other with pile cream, chocolate sauce, vodla, spaghetti and cheese....  ...it was all pretty low-grade, seeing as we didn't know anyone, except 'Browny' - who we don't like anyway; and everyone was FAR more pissed than we were.  Then this yooj blerk came and sat down next to me and it turns out he's a History Nut too, does WW2 re-enactments and stuff - so it was fun talking to him.    THEN   this verrr cyooot redhed turns up - in boots and a short skirt and lippy (verr nyum) - and it turns out that doll-face is Big Blerk's missis - by which time, Big Blerk had sodded off and left me talking to cutie-pie....  I was havin' a good time: we were getting along great and there was a nice view...  ...so Heff turns up in his coat to say: "The Cab's here!"   Pissflaps.    m=(@_@)=m   In other news, Heff's birthday and my birthday and Dad have enabled us to spend most of today on Scan, buying a digi-cam, memory card, graphic and sound card, sexi black glass mousemat, 8 slot card-reader and box of curry spices (??).  It is all due to arrive on Tuesday - we are in a VERY happi mood as a result.  Especially since we're gunna spend tomorrow re-arranging the downstairs so we can set up the new telly, dvd, vcr and surround sound system donated to the Inmates by Ma & Pa.  m= =m  Currently, the Inmates of  'Mauvais Maison Flop de Sasha'  are having post-BBQ pizza and vodka - as it turns out Heather managed to "liberate" an unsupervised bottle of Vodka from Pin'ead's.  Jayzus - you can't take the woman   anywhere  !  Well, twice: the second time to apologise.  There is much munchy hilarity ocurring next-door; Heff keeps trotting though, kissing the top of my head and feeding me the occasional onion ring and, oops! He just dripped garlic sauce on my keyboard...  Oh Tragedy!!   Quelle  dommage !!!    I will absolutely  HAVE  to buy myself a nice light-up keyboard (and matching mouse) (and LED mousemat) now!!  How simply   terrible  ....  *grinz insanely*   (PS. No-one fell down the hole. I was crushed.) .~*~.

      .~*~.  Int'restin day yesterday.  Low grade rumblings, punctuated by short bursts of intense ag, that constitutes Heff and my relationship at the moment, continued. Stuff's getting worked out; but I'm just gonna have to accept that he can't do some of the things I expect of him. Though I'm still holding out for him learning over time.  As he's wont to point out: he's only wikkle.  Actually managed to go out and have a good time last night, with minimal drama. Dragged Pin'ead out - rescued him from his decorating horrors. Having lived in his house for three-anna-half years, he's finally been poked into decorating activity by the sudden realisation that his BBQ guests will otherwise be attending the social event of the year in a slum. Hence a week of pandemoninic decorating ensues.   Hey...I got that T-shirt, too!  In other news, my therapist thinks there's something wrong with me.  *gasp*  Surely not???  Apart from the depression, she reckons I have some other knackeration of the brane, one that I've had all my life.  *blinks*  Ya don't say??  She's guessing it's either a neurochemical imbalance or some kinda dissociative disorder; and that the depression is a symptom of this, rather than the cause.  *rolls eyes*  No shit, Sherlock.  I mean, 's not like I bin telling shrink after shrink this since I was, like, 19, or anything.  Thank god that the odd one of 'us' managed to get through the 'them' police, and end up working in the mental health service. Finally, someone can see through the thick layer of natural, harmless, eccentricity to the psyco lurking underneath.   I have now to convince my shrink: tho at least I now have some backup. I suspect this will mean a further daily intake of nasty chemicals; but if it stops me killing someone or ending up in a hemp sack under a tree myself, I guess I will have to deal.  Tonight the inmates of  'La Mauvais Maison Flop de Sasha'  are off, mobhanded, to Pin'ead's barbecue. Charred flesh and warm beer in the rain - cool!   The event is made even more interesting by the fact that, somewhere in his garden, Pin'ead has dug a big hole. This was when he first moved into his house and had a mad enthusiasm for gardening: digging a bloody great hole was as far as he got before it wore off.   Last night I asked him if, in honour of his guests, he has filled it in.  He hasn't.  In fact, he revealed, he has simply allowed the grass in it to grow to a sufficient lenght to render it practically invisble.  So, that'll be extra tot of rum for the first person to fall in it, then...  (I just bet it's me...)   I will report back when I get home from casualty, in the wee small hours, then.  *sigh*  .~*~.

      .~*~.   ..And the Fairy said to me: "would you like a cup of tea?" I said "no, no, cocoa -  down in the dell"   Despite the fact that my cousin penned these lines at the tender age of four, I think that, as the years have passed, this short stanza has come symbolically to represent my life... "in a very real - and legally binding - sense"   (With genuflection to Michael Palin, also.)       m=(@_@)=m       In other news, barbeque  en famille  today - et lots, slobbed around in the garden, took the piss out of Gran, watched Dad take piss out of Glampy's pseudopodia, was amazed that Dad still had a pulse at end of the day.  Aaaaaah....it was GOOD:  cleanness, organisation, countryside, peace, amusement,free haircuts, guilt-free relaxation, elderly madness and familial warmth - all topped off with Heff's favourite bits: new gadgets and free food.  On the way back home, lulled into happy doze by the sound of the kids quoting madwebsite and Churchillian wit at one another and giggling.  What could be better?  Though I  still  can't believe  la Glamp  didn't clout my Father upside tha hed....  .~*~.

      .~*~.  ...except bicker or fuck.  Heff and I had a major explosion on Friday and split up.  That's it: both had enough, can't stand the constant shit; both hit 'hopper full'; lost it totally and bellowed, stamped about, bitched, slammed stuff...  So, best to part - quit while we're ahead, before it goes too far and we end up hating one another.  The yelling and nastiness stopped - what's the point? - and we got all civilised and calm about it: no tears, no regrets.   Just a howling void of pain in the pit of my stomach, and the effort to keep telling myself that it's all for the best, we can't keep living like this, it's going to destroy both of us in the end; and willing myself not to weaken and be talked out of it this time.    Trouble is, when it comes down to arranging the practicalities of him leaving, it's all too unbearable; we're paralysed: don't know how to move forward, drag ourselves back from the edge of the abyss; but neither do we want to face being apart.  We love each other too much: life without the other seems impossible.  So we talked; and stuff was said that needed to be said; and other stuff was said that should have been said at the time; and we come to agreements for moving forward; and we stagger on, cautiously feeling our way along the long, dark tunnel of the future: one day at a time; one hour at a time; one step at a time; a single breath at a time.  Like I said: I know exactly where I want to be; but I don't know if I can get here from here. So minute by minute is all I can do.  But things are better.  It's all the external life-stress we've had, constantly, for the last year, that does this. Since Heff got here it's been one big crisis after another: he arrived in the middle of the night, right in the middle of a huge emotional crisis - and it's been pretty much like that since then, one way or another. And it takes its toll on our ability to function as individuals; hence, our ability to communicate.  I think we are both living for a future point where we have time, space and calm enough to explore - properly explore - each other and our relationship. At the moment, daily interaction is so damn hard: everything else gets in the way - and we just end up stressing each other out. I think we've realised this is counter-productive: living constantly in the future isn't realistic or healthy. We have to live day-to-day, focussing on the moment, and wait and see what happens.  The thing is not helped by the fact that I am really quite mad at the moment - I feel like I'm clinging on by my fingernails again; and that Heff's too young to be expected to cope with such a weight of unfamiliar crap and responsibility all in one great lump.   He's coped bloody amazingly, all things considered; but he's only wikkle and a lot of it is new, bewildering and scary. The crapfulness of life usually dawns on one slowly, over a period of years, while one makes the gradual transition from carefree youth to adulthood - and all the arse-nailing tedium and responsibility that this implies.   Heffy hasn't had that luxury: one minute he's living in studently uncertainty, trying to get his head around the (comparatively) mild studenty-type problems of money, accommodation and WTF he's gunna do with hisself next; ten seconds later he's dropped bodily into the lunatic asylum that is my life, and has to try and figure out which way is up fast enough to locate the surface and learn to swim before he drowns.  And I'm about as much use to him as a chocolate teapot.   Trouble is, when he's keeping everything in and trying to cope on his own, he's so damn convincing that I tend to forget this is all new to him. I expect him to know and understand stuff he can't   possibly   have experienced. I mean, he's smart; but no-one gets to be   that   capable, that quickly, from a standing start.  Anyway, we've resolved to try and go easy on one another. At the moment, although there is stress, there aren't the giant, looming crises that there have been in the past. So we're trying to stay calm and pull together; and have promised one another to try and communicate more honestly and clearly, so that all those stupid misapprehensions and erroneous assumptions don't creep in and fuck everything up.  Relationships are hell; and this one was   so   not on my radar when it kinda landed in my lap a year ago. I've never had to work  so hard  at building anything in my life before. Then again, I've never wanted anything  so badly  before - never felt this much for anyone. He's my soulmate: I don't  need  him; I just  want  him so much it's worth anything to try and build a workable, solid relationship on the foundations we already have.  Why is it so bloody difficult? I catch myself resentfully muttering about love being supposed to make everything run smoothly, supposedly being enough on its own.   Bullshit.   As it turns out, it just makes the stakes that much higher, mistakes and neglect that much more costly, and everything that much more bloody painful and scary.   Love?  It suxass, if you ask me.  By all logical assessments, it's a form of psychosis.  Like I need any more of that.  But all rationale and logic go straight down the gurgler when, after a day of unresolved bitterness and recrimination, I look up from my book at night and watch the little bugger sleeping: his face all scrunched up, snoring his head off, flailing around like an octopus on speed, muttering and yelling in his dreams, with his hair falling over his face, his eyes half open and his arse hanging out of the duvet; and then he rolls over, fast asleep still, and rests his head on my stomach, and does this happy, snuggly, little sigh...  .~*~.

And I'm left with a feeling of sadness at how easily people will ascribe the worst of motives to the actions of others, on the flimsiest of evidence; and at how quickly everything positive and honourable is forgotten.  Everyone bends the universe around themselves I guess.  I know where I want to be; but I have no idea how to get there.  Or even if it's possible to get there from here.  I'm just exhaused, raw and confused, now.  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Bloody hell, this week has gone fast. All this buggering about doing nothing, I guess.  Today has been full of surprises already, and it's only lunchtime! For a start, Heff is actually up; he levered himself out of his pit, bleary-eyes and incoherent, when Dad showed up for coffee. He even went and got dressed!  Dad turned up on his own and we sat about drinking coffee, and watching him trough doughnuts (making the most of Ma not being around to disapprove), while he told us all about the battle-plan for emigrating to France. I'm desperate for them to move into some ancient pile in the Languedoc - I wanna explore all those fascinating Templar and Cathar sites; but it's looking increasingly like it's gonna be le Midi. There's still a chance they might end up near the Pyrenees, though: so I am going to do some 'helpful' research on the 'net, and see what I can find.  It's like the old days: they know they're going, but they haven't a clue exactly where yet. Dad looks extraordinarily happy at the prospect; footloose and fancy-free has always suited him; and he's more than happy to bung what's left of the furniture (after he's given most of it to Sid and me) into storage, load up the camper, and just go.  Bastard - I'm so fucking jealous!!  The other thing that happened this morning is that looks like we may be finally within hailing distance of not being quite so far in the shit. It's a bit of a shock; but an extremely pleasant one.   Once we are able to get the house straight again, we can sort out the rent, too - which would take a big load off my mind. It won't be for a bit, I know; as H&N have to find a house first; but there's some stuff I can be getting on with in the meantime, so it's looking a bit more hopeful.  The only blot on the landscape is that I woke up with a high temperature this morning: my ear, glands and the right side of my face are excruciating . Luckily, the application of some bread, 1200mg of Ibruprofen and a lot of coffee has made it just about bearable - though I still feel slightly sick and a little dizzy. If it isn't better tomorrow, I think I might haul arse to casualty and see if they will give me some antibiotics; but I fucking HATE taking them: they really DO make me feel sick - plus, they give me galloping thrush that takes weeks to get rid of (I like to share this stuff with the general public), so it's pretty-much a last resort.  We are all off out for a happy Family Outing to the vet in an hour, to get himself jabbed. I hope it perks him up a bit - he's getting really loony and demanding. Half-past eight he woke me up this morning: though I only managed to drag my carcase out of bed at 10 - after Heffy had fed him and retired again.  After the vet, I think that the level of excitement will require that I sort out the Pit that is our bedroom, then retire to same to read, watch telly and get lots of lovely sleep - while George is otherwise occupied.  At this rate, it's gonna end up like having a newborn, with me sleeping when he does so I can feed and cuddle him on demand. Currently, the little sod is mooching about the house - no doubt he will try to do his usual disappearing act the moment that he spots the cat-carrier on the bed...  Oooh, here he comes - he's wandering towards the catflap in what he hopes is a nonchalant manner...  Well, un-fucking-lucky, cat: Daddy just locked the catflap!!!  MWAhahahahahahahaaaaa!!  Oh grief: I'm getting glared at, now...and...yes! He's sulking at me. Look at the quality of that resentful, pathetic, guilt-trippy attitude: takes years and years of dedicated practice to perfect that, you know.  I'm about to piss him off even further by giving him his pill.  Oh, now he's staring at me in a fixed manner...he can keep that up for hours - even if you throw cushions at him.  Yeah, I am such a bad mother...it's all those pilchards and tuna I keep feeding you that gives me away, innit?   *rolls eyes*  Cats: give me a three-year-old any day.  They might sit in front of the telly - just as it gets to the good bit - when you annoy them, too; but at least they don't stay three for  eighteen years .  *sigh*  .~*~.

      [through gritted teeth]Well, I have to say, I do so   love   my little kitty....[/through gritted teeth]  I know he can't help it; but being clawed, yelped and dribbled awake after two or three hours' sleep is beginning to get on my nerves. And he's getting madder by the day. Still, he's off to the vet tomorrow - perhaps the 'jection will help; but I'm forced to confront the fact that he's really on his way out, now.   Why couldn't he have got something that would mean that I'd just wake up one morning to find him peacefully, permanently, asleep? I can't stand the thought that, finally, the decision will be down to me; or that he won't get to die peacefully at home. He HATES going to the vet. Poor baby. I just hope it's less traumatic than the last time: at least I know what to expect; and I'm gunna make sure I don't get that miserable bastard vet this time. George and I both like the nice grrly vet best.  Currently, the mad little sod is chasing flies around the living-room. Mostly, this involves waiting till they land, pouncing manically, then sliding off up the other end of the room as he can't get a grip on the floor. Still not as amusing as watching him hurtle round in little circles trying to get at the flying bat/Dracula. He has no idea that he's the object of such hilarity! Then again, he never really cared all that much - unlike Xigi, who would sulk terribly if you laughed at him: then stalk of to find something to pee on in revenge.   I am feeling low and grumpy today - not only due to lack of sleep but also because I have an ear infection. It appeared out of nowhere last night: in the space of a couple of hours. It's excruciatingly painful and even huge doses of Ibroprofen, although they get rid of the fluey, achey shit, don't really touch the pain in my ear. It feels like it's full of water to boot - keeps popping which, although it gets rid of most of the pain for about 20 mins at a go, is both annoying and revolting.  Happy days, huh?  Though I am getting quite a lot of work done; there's fuckall I can do between 9am, when I'm clawed out of bed [NTS: find clippers and cut George's toenails], and 2pm - when the rest of the household starts to surface.   Apart from this, I am feeling pretty good about stuff. Ma and Dad, having definitely sold their house, are like kids at the prospect of heading France-ward. They've just ordered us a new mattress; and are trying to see what furniture etc. we could cram into the houselet. It's like 'get your inheritance early', kinda fing. Though I think we're all looking forward to the arrival of the flatscreen TV, VCR, DVD player and cinema surround sound system. Pity about the naff cabinet/stand fingy it comes in; but I guess it would be churlish to complain...  *grinz*  Heffy missed his doc's appt. yesterday, so we have to do the whole thing again next week. I think it's massively unreasonable: we were only five minutes late; and when I think about the HOURS I've wasted in their waiting rooms.... *sigh* I fail to see why he couldn't just be tacked onto the end of the surgery; but I guess nursie wanted an early afternoon.  So we went into tow-un instead - the place was hell, as it's the Suffolk Show this week and it seemed like every motor vehicle plus moron contingent for miles around was in the town-centre. We had a nice lunch though - it was good to get out of the house and focus on each other for a change. We've decided that we should do this more often. His back's getting better, too; and, all 'round, he's a much happier Heffy as a result.   When he's not battling with his fucking PC that is: then he gets all tired and grumpy.  *sigh*  Boys and their toys...  I'm also Goddessfully resisiting the urge to make a start on the garden: still got house stuff to do; though it's pretty-much ground to a halt while H&N are here - there's just not the space to start things like plastering and sanding the stairs; and none of us could stand the added chaos - there's more than enough of that already. It's a bit like we're all camping out; though it's good to see that we're getting along so well, considering how we're crammed in!   George is still a little resentful that he is unable to get at the ratties: why put interesting snacks in his midst and then not let him have them? I think he's decided it's some kind of initiative test: he sits there for hours just looking at them - you can hear his tiny mad cat-brane plotting the defeat of the little metal bars and imagining what it will be like to gorge himself on Hot Rat Surprise unhindered. (The surprise being that they'll probably do more damage to him than he to them, in the (unlikely) event he should ever actually succeed).  My single, solitary Sea Monkey is still soldiering on: having eaten all the others he's HUGE!! Although I am something of a Darwinist, I don't really like him, much. He looks shifty, to me...  Today I might glue on the bits of skirting board I can reach; and (finally) mow the lawn.  Or I might just find somewhere quiet and comfortable and read my book all day.  Decisions, decisions....  .~*~.

I got something called...wait...what was it?...Oh yeah....a LIFE!!  Yanno, that thing that other people do when they're not terminally welded to their fucking internet connection?  I can recommend it - you should try it sometime.  I'm sure there must be a support group for sad inadequates near you that can help you with it.    Jeez...    *shakes head in contemptuous disbelief*   .~*~.

It's okay: you can tell me - I can take it.  .~*~.   Well, things turned out better'n I hoped.   I guess I'm so used to knee-jerk reactions from people, I forget that there are tolerant, understanding, rational folks about too.  I really didn't think I was gunna get away with that one: I'd put on the helmet Dee gave me and retired to the blast-proof bunker in anticipation of the storm breaking again.  As it turns out, it wasn't necessary.  What's going on? This isn't my life...?  *glares suspiciously at surroundings*  The week off is going pretty well: I have done nuffink much except write, cook, write mail to ppl and swipe the odd kitchen surface down with bleach.   Yesterday turned out to be the day when all my appointments caught up with me: finally got a place at the dermatology clinic; my councillor called; I got a letter from the shrink with yet another new date; and George is off to the vet on Friday for his (long overdue) jab.  I've also finally started to read the book on the 30's I've been saving up - for when I can read it in vast chunks: it's deliciously absorbing; and wonderful to apply my brain to something more interesting and challenging than sanding stuff and working out how to glue plank A to wall B without having to spend all day with foot C, foot D and freezer X pressed up against it...  Yanno, since I decided to do sod all for a bit, a suspiciously large amount of stuff seems to be getting sorted.  Odd, that...  Today, if it doesn't rain, I might get around to mowing the lawn.   Then again, I might not...  *grinz cheerfully*  .~*~.

      .~*~.   It's quite true: your errors of judgement   do   follow you around forever.  They rear up, their ugly grinning faces dripping gore from that reeking, fetid swamp that is their natural habitat, to spit filth at you just when you thought they'd sunk out of sight forever.  I can hardly claim to be surprised: frankly, I'm surprised I've had any peace and quiet, in this context, for as long as this; and I knew this weekend would probably poke the beast into making another appearance; but I feel I have to get on with my life, regardless. I can't not do the things I want for the sake of the Beast's continued smug, sanctimonious, occupation of it's swamp unmolested, now, can I?  It just pisses me off that unless you are willing to cede the high moral ground, and sink to swamp-level yourself, you can never get rid of the hassle that you accrue as a result of a simple lapse of attention (no matter how large, in hindsight, it turned out to be).  It seems a bit of a steep price to have to keep paying: but I guess there's no choice.  I have blown my stack now, so there's sod all I can do about it: I'm not able to take any of it back - it's all true; and I can't even apologise for sharing it, coz I strongly believe I have the right to correct misapprehensions and false-hoods when they have a direct bearing on my life and reputation.  Such as it is.  All I can say is :"Oh Well"; and hope it doesn't turn out to be the same for you - especially seeing as the stakes are so terrifyingly high, this time.  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Strike one more from the list of things I have lost any aptitude for; I used to throw legendary parties....  *sigh*  I feel humiliated and embarrassed; apologies to everyone (those rare few) who made the effort.    Massive   apologies to my fellow inmates of  "Mauvais Maison Flop de Sasha" , who I have put through  HELL  in the last few weeks, in the name of what I should have seen was a lost cause from the outset.  Sorry guys....  If I make a huge roast dinner, would you forgive me? It's the only thing I am sure I can do well enough to be representative of any kind of consolation...?  It was, however, still good to see people I have liked and admired actually in the flesh. I would say 'meet', but I wasn't really around for long enough for it to count. I'd like to spend more time with a couple of people and get to know them; I just hope the week-end's fiasco hasn't stamped, terminally, all over any possibility of that ever happening.  Oh well....  On the positive side, at least I have acquired a 'legitimate target' now; and it does confirm the long-standing, ever growing, suspicion that I should abandon all attempts at further social interaction: the Universe seems to be unanimous on this one.  Perhaps it really is time to put my money where my mouth is and finally use all the weirdness and degredation that has passed for 'fun', the bizarre and unfathomable experiences I have collected over the years, for something useful.  I had a dream the night-before-last: it was the basis for a whole novel; and, for a change, I feel inspired and enthusiastic enough to write it. #  All this stuff may turn out to be a blessing, in the end: circumstances dictate I can't stay up all night any more; so I find myself awake before everyone else - and able to write while it's quiet.  How odd: I never saw myself as ever being able to write during the day at all - let alone first thing in the morning. It feels good: like I'm achieving something.  I am alive to the fact that this probably won't come to anything; not sure my writing is more than a personal indulgence - a private vice - anyway; but it's nice to feel unreservedly good about something for a change. Now that things stand a chance of settling down into some species of normality, I feel like the pressure has gone and I can do what I like - rather than what I feel I ought to be doing.   Writing feels clean, suddenly: something whole and positive, free from struggle and taint and guilt. Perhaps, after all the years of waiting, the time   is   right and I am finally ready.  I dunno; but   something   has definitely changed....  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Yup.   For the  second  time in  two days , I actually left the house.  On my own.  In daylight.  On foot....  (And went to the pub - but that's a whole 'nuther bag a ferrets)  Yus, I am |_337 Conqueress of the Universe!!  (Well, Ipswich, anyway.)  (Oh, okay: just my agoraphobia.)  *frowns*  But I still  rock .  (Oh yes, I  SO  do.)  *takes deep breaths and calms down*  m==(0_*)==m  So, today, after therapy (of the dermatological - rather than the psychological or psychiatric - species), Heff and I went into town and mooched about.  It was fun: we bought lots of exciting things like Jossticks, piggy stuff for Dad's b'day, pentagram bandanas, BCRs, books about Marco Polo, haematite eggs in velour bags (as you do) - and the complete works of Alex Pope (a total DUDE, he was). We also did  less  exciting stuff like pay bills, pick up meds and buy earplugs (for Heff - and no, it's not 'cuz of my snoring, thank-you)....and Heff spent some time poking hopefully 'round Game Shops; though, for reasons known only to himself, he thinks this activity also falls under the heading 'fun'.  *shrugs*  Don't ask me: I'm middle-aged.  Eventually, we got tired, so we went and had a rest - in the pub.   Which was also nice - well,  obviously .   We get to talk utterly meaningless bollox at each other when we go to the pub in daylight. When we're home we don't really do that, anymore - too much other boring and hassly shite to talk about; and when we go out at night, it's all about being as raucous as poss., getting pissed (purely accidentally - or so I'm earnestly assured), or sitting there bored out of our tiny little skulls, coz there's no entertainment and the music totally suxass.  Anyway, today in the pub we covered the whole "platain-banana ratio" debate, bird-shit in its many and varied forms and contexts, Heff's beard (it's ginger!!! *runs away and hides till he gives up and drops the stick*), our respective Fathers' beards, and the horrifyingly parlous state of facial hair, in general, amongst Contemporary European Youth.   We ALSO discussed the painful issue of the Army Surplus.  This extensive discussion ranged across many fascinating sub-topics, which included assessing the odds on: Dee failing to turn up at the weekend, to do the Car-boot-sale as promised(high); being stuck with this season's Khaki Collection, inc. assorted matching accessories, for bleeding  ages  (even higher); and the likelihood of Dee 'storing' other things/coming up with other jolly wheezes of a similar nature, that will similarly fill our hovel to the rafters with crud, at regular intervals in the future (astronomical).    We've concluded that, if this turns out to be the case, we will be petitioning quite vigorously for him to provide us with a large shed.  We also realised that all his  personal  combat kit is still here - as it has been since he 'temporarily' deposited it, in a vast swathe in our dining-room, after his accident. Since then, and having been tidied away, sorted through, trawled for items of clothing/bedding when he's stayed here since - and consequently 're-packed' several times (mostly into a variety of supplementary plastic bags), it has inexorably spread throughout the  entire  house. Nevertheless, the majority of it is still huddling together in a squalid pile, determinedly cluttering up Heather's sardine tin of a bedroom.  I feel that, fond though I am of my cousin - and I am quite fond of him still - this situation cannot continue.   Therfore we feel object lessons must be taught. Subtlety must be abandoned; nettles must be grasped; persuasive techniques employed  - and, if possible, income should be generated. The wee love must learn that it is inadvisable to leave personal property, to which he may be sentimentally and/or legally attached, lying about in our bijou-rat-run - even if, technically, he does actually own said rodent-dwelling.  The theory we are basing our persuasion technique upon is as follows:   if it's not Mine or Heff's (or Nick's or Heather's - for the duration) and it's not nailed down, it gets sold.    (Unless it's of any practical use to us, of course)  We are unanimous and united in this decision as well - in itself, a small miracle: though possibly attributable in part to the high sugar content of Coca-Cola. (Specifically, its effect upon the already super-charged nervous system of the average unfed Heff in his lunchtime state.)  Anyway, I hear you can get a fair amount of hard cash for a current issue camo Bergen...  *sniggers*    Am   I mean?  Hell yes.  It's a harsh reality that simply has to be faced: the house just  isn't  big enough to become a dumping ground for another person's randomly abandoned possessions; and, as he never actually  asks  us - about pretty-much  anything  - it's not as if we can politely demur.  Radical, practical, direct action is the only remedy we have.  Besides which, it's  funny .  "Oh...erm...I didn't realise that you still had any of   your   stuff here...God, I'm  awfully  sorry Dee - I thought it was part of the army surplus stuff.....so I...er...kinda...well,  sold  it...."  *pause for dramatically acute look of extreme guilt and discomfort to spread across face*  "..uh..well...er...sorry...and all that....um...?"  *slightly shorter pause to allow face to brighten a bit - as if helpful and mollifying thought has just occurred*  "...ah...but we DID get quite a good price for it...er...the current deal is what? half and half, isn't it? I'll write you a cheque for...er..your half, then...no...?"  I laugh...  *Laughs*  As you can see, the pub outing was quite productive...  m==(-_@)==m  Sadly, though, the day ended on a bit of a bummer: Heff's got the bleedin stomach thing back: he threw up and went straight to bed when we got in; and he's really pissed off. He's absolutely had enough of being bloody sick.   Or "incapacitated and useless" as he puts it, in his usual understated fashion.  Like I say: bummer.  Especially as he was cooking roast chicken tonight...  *sniff*  Oh well...I feel for him. Incapacitated is my middle name.    Sasha Incapacitated Mary Elizabeth Slasha.   Good, innit?  (Yeah, okay - you may have a valid point.)  m==(#_@)==m  In other news, the hamster-powered PC of doom has been released to the Tart-Smash and Ginger-Loon Asylum Hospital for the Free-Spirited, Independent-Minded and Terminally Unco-operative Electronic Counting Machine.  Initially, morale was high amongst the staff: when the transfer was agreed hope shone on every bright, shiny little face.   With enthusiasm and confidence, a hasty case-conference was conducted in the Smashie and Ratty Sleeping Area; consensus was reached; and a brief - if drastic - course of treatment was prescribed.   The finest specialist agreed to take on the case.  Almost momentarily, the SRSA being hastily converted into an operating theatre / HDU, surgery commenced: guts were moved around, transplanted, re-assembled ; bits were enthusiastically sanitised, disinfected and re-connected; Electronic EZT, SSRI's and Erithromycin administered in vast doses - all without let or hindrance.   The prognosis was excellent: the patient was expected to make a complete recovery and return to rude health within the day.  Optimism was high when the test-results returned from Pathology, the patient was sewn up, and the big switch-on commenced.  Alas!! The unpredictability of a career in remiedial care! The inexplicable inconsistencies and vaguaries of micro-electronic-unitkind!  Of course, the bloody thing's still doing it's best Dodo impersonation: it remains extinct.  Despite their nice, clean, upright new case (scavenged from me Dad's ailing unit - which has cowered resentfully under the desk ever since he stranded it here a couple of months ago), the bits from my PC are still sulking and out on strike.   They miss the comfortable dust-balls and general grot of their old, familiar home: the power supply is furious (all the little hamsters got out and smashed up the wheel); the CPU has ejected all its steam-pressure-valves from their little sockety-slots in a fit of depression-induced pique.   As ever, next-door in the study, the monitor and keyboard are in a suspicious little huddle, plotting the best possible moment to quietly commit suicide - thereby scuppering the whole project to an irrecoverably terminal degree.  At least, I  think  that's what's happened: I'm not a technical sort of a person, so I'm having to guess a bit, here.  I think the medics are implementing Plan B in the morning....so I guess I will have a fully functional machine by this time tomorrow.  Though knowing my PC of old, I won't be holding my breath - purple not really being my colour, an' all.  m=(+_+)==W  Which brings me to....  Lunch.  As in: "I am having   lunch   with my parents tomorrow"   As this will not be an event witnessed by anyone of any of our acquaintence, the possible opinions of whom may be of concern to my mother, I am preparing myself.  No doubt the polite, restrained, amusingly mild-mannered parently skin will be shed in one messy great heap - abruptly revealing the horrifying scaly hide that lurks beneath it - pretty much as soon as we are all in the car.  I can't   think   of anything I have done that might incur any censure, admonition, concern, offers of cash in used notes (no, I'm not kidding), debate, interrogation or the general waving about of seniority and/or parental rank...  ...but, with  my  Olds, you wouldn't wanna bet on it.  (Not unless the Bookie's suddenly started accepting Army Surplus in lieu of cash, anyway.)  The best I can hope for is that Dad, in anticipation of HADL*-day, has put me back on the car-insurance and I get to drive the Volvo.  Then again, that may just as easily turn out to be  worse  than anything I could possibly sit here and imagine.  Like I say: with my Olds, you just  never  know...      *Have A Driving Licence.   .~*~.

      .~*~.  ...I feel like I'm living in a Dali painting, sometimes.  Yup, oddness abounds.  Yesterday, I woke up happily mad, deliriously in love, gainfully unemployed....yanno, kinda broke but happy? Things were progressing apace, stuff getting sorted, house not too chaotic: and I had a PLAN.  By the end of the day - plan down gurgler, remaining space in house crammed fulla junky-type stuff; and, unexpectedly, I find that I'm in the Army Surplus business by accident....  Indeed, you read correctly: the house is now even fuller of camo gear and an assortment of other odds, sods and bits of equipment - all of it in various attractive shades of baby-shit, slime and mud.  It's the notorious ITSC/landlord of d00m, again.   You see, he has this military mate....  Actually it's just another in the long line of his hare-braned schemes for making money - only this time, the intended recipients of this unforseen moolah are us.  Which is nice, I s'pose...  *doubtfully eyes heap of army jumpers piled on floor*  I wouldn't mind but, as usual with Dee, it's all rather last-minute, rushed and unexpected.   Saturday, he phones at 6 to ask if he can come crash for the night.   No mention of anything Khaki and rubbery, woolly or canvassy accompanying him.   He'll be three hours, he sez.  Come 11 o'clock, here he is, straight from work, all tarted up in full combat gear (complete with hat and rolled-up sleeves - for that authentic 'combat' look), starving, knackered and voluable as ever.  It took him 10 minutes of pleasantries before he slipped into the convo that he had some stuff for us to sell; another minute or two to trot out the sad tale of his mate needing the money; and, about five minutes later, 'a few bits and pieces' had turned into an entire car-load.  So there we are: as well as the two hosp. appts. a week, and two putative driving-lessons, and all the other bits and pieces I gotta do round the house (painting the porch and the front door, and doing the front garden were the list for this week), I gotta find time to do army surplus stuff.  Although almost all of it is brand-new and never worn, in true Diarmaid stylee none of it is sorted: no order, no sizes. Most of it will need ironing - if not washing, from what I can see.   Currently, most of it is squashed up in a bleedin' great heap in the back-bedroom; the rest in the study. I can see jumpers and what looks like a sleeping-bag: there are alleged to be trousers, boots, hats, jackets, helmets, NBC suits, gasmasks and body-bags; but, apart from that, Goddess alone knows what's in there (except that I don't).  So, looks like we'll be spending the next few days sorting and inventorying the lot so we can start getting rid of it (she said, hopefully). Some of it is being car-booted next weekend; some of it will be eBayed; and the rest we're gunna find a kink-friendly site so we can flog it to perverts (like us!), who will pay reasonable prices for the genuine kit, apparently.  This is gunna be a team effort, mind: all muck in, split the profit. It might even turn out to be a decent amount of money, if we do it properly and think about it.  Fun, eh?  On the up-side, Heather was  very  excited   indeed   to find out that a lot of the stuff came in small sizes - one of the reasons they're getting rid of the stuff, apparently: a lot of it won't fit hulking great squaddies. Her little face lit up like a Roman candle.   Heather  likes  uniforms...  *grinz*  I must say, she really does look  awfully  cute in the staff sargeant's No.2 Jacket (complete with medal ribbon) and guard's peaked cap she's appropriated. Though she put on the Royal Irish beret last night and the green plume looks great with her hair. We are confident that there are strides, waterproofs and NBC kit to fit her too.   I think I'm now gunna have to buy a plastic sheet to put under her.   She's such a perve, bless her: she's so adorable!   (Inna kinda mad, loud, violent and very, very scary kinda way.)  The downside of Dee's visit is that he's getting a bit twitchy about the rent - and we can't do anything about it 'till the housebitches are re-homed and we can get on with tarting the place up. I hope Dee's not gunna get ag about this: things  are  getting sorted; but it's still gunna take a bit of time.   Besides which, he knew the situation re. the benefits when he bought the place. I warned him that we might not get for it what he was hoping, and he was fine about it. It's a bit bleeding late to start getting jumpy about interest rates, and how much it's costing him, now: there's really sod all we can do about it if the Council doesn't share his view of what it's worth - tarting up and everything.  On other fronts, I am gunna find out about driving lessons tomorrow.   *bounces maniacally*  Dad reckons a course would be better thn individual lessons - seeing as I can actually drive (apart from parking and reversing), and I need to pass my test by the end of September.  Jeeeezus!! I only just realised that this gives me about 10 weeks to do it in!  *looks sceptical*  Not that I don't think I can drive; but I'm gunna have to learn to drive a different car - probably one of those tinny little roller-skates-withan-engine types, rather than my lovely big, safe-feeling, very forgiving, Volvo estate.   Bum.  Yanno? I never thought I would ever be getting excited about owning a Volvo Estate? Sid and I used to moan like fuck about Dad's Volvo thing: we used to call 'em "flying bricks". Oh God....I must be getting old...though I am planning to tart it up a bit: black and purple. It does look quite like a Hearse, anyway, I s'pose. P'raps THAT's what it is: subconsciously, I am attracted to its Hearse-like resonance.  So long as I don't end up ded in it, obviously.  *shudders*  Oh well, at least I should be able to learn to reverse much more easily in whatever car I end up in: no dog-guard; plus it's unlikely to be smeared in mud; so I may stand some chance of being able to see out the back.  I am still really excited about this; though realism is setting in, bringing a certain level of nervousness with it. I am trying not to remember the little 'adventure' we had the last time I drove.  I must remember to tell myself: "You are FEARLESS!!! Mortals quail at your mere footsteps! You created life where there was none!! Your Seamonkey Universe swims around in circles of awe, reverence and adoration whenever you approach!!!"  Seriously, I could use a challenge - one that wasn't related just to achieving some species of normality in the face of the lunacy and the medication, that is. No matter how much progress it represents, walking to the Co-op, in daylight, by myself, just doesn't do it, yanno? It will do me good to have to overcome the nerves, learn something useful, and feel like I've achieved something positive and worthwhile, for a change.   It's been a long time.  .~*~.

      .~*~.  The BIG news today is that Dad and Ma, now definitely moving to France in October, have decided that I can't possibly cope without them while I can't drive.  This, coupled with the desire not to let anyone else get their sweaty paws on what was always supposed to be MY Volvo, has led them to decide to pay for driving lessons and leave me the car after all. This is the third car they've bought me: to date, I haven't managed actually to own and drive any of them.  *Smiles Hopefully At Driving-test Faery*   So I have 'till October to learn to drive: two lessons a week, no falls, no submissions and keep taking the new meds.  I am DELIRIOUS!!    I keep thinking about how brilliant it will be just to be able to drive to the coast when I want; take Heff and The Kids out and show them the sights of Suffolk; and finally be able to go to the supermarket or DIY place on my own, without hanging about for bleedin taxis, or having to persuade someone else to go with me.  Coz, sad to say - and wholly inexplicably, the agoraphobia (which I STILL can't spell) has reasserted itself again. I'm fine if I'm with Heff; but even the  thought  of walking to the off-licence on my own makes me hyperventilate and my blood go cold.   It's making me feel really bad: I thought we'd got through all this shit. I was working up to buses and everything; now, even the bloody co-op feels like it may as well be on Mars - via a big pit of hot coals and maggots.  Still, I'm okay going to the Dermatology clinic on my own: the hospital feels quite familiar to me now; and I know the clinic is very quiet and usually devoid of all humanity except Sharon and Merle - who I know. And,   man!!   is this treatment working, or What?? I didn't have any yesterday, coz I burnt a bit from the last one; but the skin-lurgy is receding at quite an astonishing rate.   Itches like   FUCK  ; but you can't have everything.  Things with the adorable Heff are just so good I daren't breathe. We seem to have come through an exceedingly rocky patch, and have managed to get positive and productive stuff from all the trauma. Currently, we're both more happy, settled and secure than we've ever been: we're so in lurve it's puke-making.   Probably be back to some version of screaming, swearing, throwing stuff and slamming doors soon; but it won't have the same terrible emotional impact, like an argument or a disagreement is the end of everything, anymore.   I   am   worried about his health, though.   He takes so little care of himself: and although I try gently to point out certain lapses in essential nutrition to him, I am not going to become his mother, constantly nagging him on the subject. Besides which, he will go his own way, whatever anyone else thinks; so 'forcing' him to do anything is pointless. I think he is beginning to change his mind about a couple of the less sensible  elements of his preferred life-style, though *crosses fingers*; and he is beginning to grasp that his choices and attitudes have an impact on me, as well. I have also informed him that if he eats crap, sits at the PC all day, screws with his sleep and stuff - and ends up making himself ill as a result, he can't expect sympathy from me.  At present, though, he is  up to his  neck   in sympathy, as he's genuinely ill.   I'm being nice to him.  I think he's quite scared....  *grinz*  I think he's having some form of gastric migraine - I used to get it when I was a kid; so we're experimentally removing all migraine-inducing substances from his diet, while feeding him stemetil and ibruprofen, and trying not to have doughnuts or sweets for breakfast, to see if it makes a difference.  So far, he's quite happy - today he slept till 2.30; but it was the first day for ages that he hasn't woken up and immediately felt like shit-onna-stick.  Apart from that, there is the usual, low-grade drama going on: strictly eye-rolling material that I've got so used to that it hardly registers on my dramometer, any more - and makes more entertainment than it does hand-wringing angst, ennui or stress.  So, it being raining today, Gropy-slut and Tart-Smash being abroad terrorizing innocent passers-by at random, and Heffy (hopefully) going to attempt to fix me PC, I am off to sit on the sofa and carry on with the fringing of Gran's shawl.    Now that I've made as many nets for the house as is either useful or healthy, I decided I better get on with it.  Finally.  I mean, her Birthday   was   in February...  And it's not, strictly speaking, knitting: so Heff can't moan and get freaked about it, either.  m==(*'o'*)==m  Also still waiting to see if Sid turns up to collect his b'day pressie, which turned up int post today. Part of me kinda hopes he doesn't: it's this really cool vampire skull I got from eBay and, now that I've seen it, I wanna keep it!!!  I guess it would be cheating not to send him a text and tell him it's here, wouldn't it?  *pouts*  Oh, I is so meeeean.  *grins and cackles*    .~*~.

      .~*~.  Yup, it's official: this household is nocturnal.  We all now have huge, pointy ears and giant, bush-baby eyes; and we spend (most) of the hours of daylight snuggled up in our nests, snoring, wheezing and (in some cases) yelling and thrashing about.  We laugh in the face of lesser, diurnal, creatures:      MWAHAHAhahahahahahahahaaaaa!    (See?)  m= =m  In other news, stuff is progressing apace. I'm almost feeling on top of things as I have managed to get meself a bit better organised over the last couple of days.  I dunno what's happened, really: but, apart from the above, it seems like stuff has started falling into place and moving forward again. The house is gradually getting sorted - though the rain prevents me from doing even the weeny bits of decorating I could get on with until everything else happens. I feel much more energetic and positive than I have for ages; and I find I am having fewer really bad days than I have for a while.   Now, there's tempting Fate for ya....  *screams with laughter as she dons her tin helmet and gasmask, and cowers behind her technologically cutting edge blast-screen (old matress), waving her chainsaw wildly at all-comers*    You're London After Midnight, and unlike most goth bands, you're not English, or formed in the 80's.

      .~*~.  For the sheer entertainment value, I am also tempting Fate today by washing the cream, floor-length, dining-room curtains.  With a dish-washer tablet.  (We've run out of laundry tablets.)  I wonder if they'll come out all clean and sparkly (like it promises on the packet); or cloudy and covered with brown, granular, particles of unidentifiable shite (like the dishes after they've been washed).  Whaddya reckon?  Exciting, innit...  .~*~.

      .~*~.  Okay, I give up *looks around nervously* - well, almost.  The Universe In General and it's eevyl hench-being Fate, in particular, have got out the old pointy-sticks and are poking them viciously in my tenderest parts again - laughing like hyenas - trying to get a reaction.  The latest is that my PC has totally died.   RIP PC.  *gloom*  I think it must have picked up some kinda virus (no shit, Sherlock) as summat has deleted all my dialup info, fucked about with the registry, the logs, administrator functions like PC manager....well, just about everything, really.  The real arse-kicker is that I no longer have a Windows 2000 disc - Huw kept it, as his PC's got W2000 on it too (and he knows what to do with it and I don't) - so we can't even bin and reinstall everything.  Yup, I know - I tempted fate: submitting this thought to public scrutiny by allowing it out of my hed....    " Well, Heff may well sneer at my elderly and temperamental hamster-powered contrary and illogical machine-of-d00m-and-d357r|_|C710|\|; but at least when it's been dismantled, abused, organ-transplanted, sworn at, insulted, dropped, kicked, tripped-over and put back together, it still actually fucking WORKS!!! "    ...was bloody stupid and I should have known better; but  who knew  Fate passed it's fag-breaks in the Shit Depot In The Sky by reading sodding blogs?  Anyway, I am now on Heff's |_337 machine of dÂ£Ã7h: if I kill  this  one, I really am [Harrovian public schoolboy accent]  TASTE  [/Harrovian public schoolboy accent]...  I will admit it: It Sux.  I miss all my nice purple colours; and the cool fetish screensaver and wallpaper I set up; I can't read anyone's blorgs, coz Heff doesn't have all me mates in his faves list; the txt on here is WEENY and evryfing looks strange; I can't even do 'monitor shopping' *  - a sure way to distract myself - coz all my links to cool shops aren't on here, either.  *pouts*  Plus, this brings down the house-total of PCs connected to the net, between the four net-addicted-saddo inmates, to 1 - the same one that is used by Heff to play games on virtually every moment he isn't asleep.  *dodges slap from Sir*  [aside]OY!! Sodoff - I'm allowed to insult-mildly-without-chastisement coz I'm going through 'trauma'!  's in the rules.  (Well, it will be when they're finally written)[/aside]  So Sunday is really panning out quite as I'd hoped.  Saturday I spent mainly asleep.  That bummed me out too, as I missed the Women's final at Wimbleeyden: only the most exciting match of the entire tournament - and one that wasn't interrupted by rain.  A Williams didn't win!!  I was stoked: I'm unkeen on the Williams' sisters - low entertainment value.  I'm gunna watch the Men's final today - if they've finished playing the semis; and assuming it's not raining - again.  I love the fact that the only two weeks of the summer when you can GUARANTEE it will rain is Wimbleeyden Fortnight. I mean, you get scorching heat forabit; then it pees down, almost constantly, for two weeks (during which time much  ad hoc.  filling, angst and embarrassmentnt from commentators, and much wailing and gnashing of teeth from professional tennis players, mooning about in Sarf Lunden wiv nuffink to do); then we get scorching heat again for the rest of the summer.  Fate and The Universe again - and I just KNOW it's all MY fault: the only three sports I really liked were (pre-pro) Rugby, Formula 1 racing and Tennis. Rugby went pro and all the fun evaporated; F1 has just got totally shit and boring since it became dominated by technology and Germans and anal concerns about safety; and the only time there's grass-court tennis on the box, it pisses with rain.  Yeah, I know this smacks of self-important paranoia; but I checked: the last time it didn't rain  practically all the time  was the last year I physically attended the All England Club to spectate and heckle  in person .  I went with my friend Fiona: she was obsessed with Ivan Lendl's bum. (That gives y'all a clue to how long ago it was) And I saw Noel Edmonds: he was short, orange, and surrounded by about 50 knuckle-dragging mouth-breather bouncer-types. I was quite surprised: he always seems like a tall, nice bloke on the telly. Should have been a forewarning incident about people called Noel not being what they seem - but I missed that one, too. Mind, I  was  only 15.  Anyway, I put the rain down to Fate deciding that allowing me to sit in front of the telly, sewing and enjoying the tennis, for two weeks'-worth of summer afternoons every year would be a large and unforgivable lapse, and an unpardonable and embarrassing waste of a perfect opportunity on it's part.  Rearranging the Universe so tennis didn't ever happen was, it felt, a little extreme...but having it rain for the whole fortnight was not only in keeping with the British version of summer - and therefore undetectable as the handiwork of Fate; but also UBER annoying to   any   tennis fan, not just me.   Bonus.  QED.  So now I am 'entertaining' myself with Big Brother while I make the muslin curtains. It's low-grade entertainment, as entertainment goes; but beggars can't be choosers.  Expect Dan and/or Stu to die of something virulent in the next week or so; and the house to burn to the ground, carbonising all its remaining occupants, shortly after that.  However, now I know about The Universe, Fate, the Dumper Trucks of Shite, the Pointy Sticks,  et. al. , I am determined to keep my amusement value to my Tormentors as minimal as possible.  Thus, despite sufficient provocation to try the proverbial patience of Job, I refuse to be downhearted.  I am not furious.  I'm not depressed.  I'm not crushed, devastated, downhearted or frustrated.  I am making the effort not to swear, throw things, smash stuff or kill people.  I am serene.  I am calm and unruffled.  I retain my poise, grace and self control.  I am still really  very  happy.  I am still smiling.  *bares teeth in manic rictus of almost-positive deliriumum*  See...?   *grits teeth*     (  * like 'window shopping': but @home )   .~*~.

      .~*~.  aRrrRgHHHh...  I really  should  be bleedin miserable.  But.  Yanno?   I really can't be   arsed  ?  It just takes  so  much sodding   effort  .  Plus, the other day, when I was torturing my eyebrows a little closer towards total oblivion, I noticed - scarily - that the two frown lines beside each eyebrow at the top of my nose are starting to become permanent...  *gasp*  ...could it be...  ...my first   wrinkle  ???   *eyes widen in horror and disbelief*  I'm pretty lucky, I guess, that I've managed to get this far without any serious wrinklage - a few micro-lines here an' there: but, generally, the needle on my wrinkleometer doesn't even flicker very often.  I can honestly claim to have been dragged off the dancefloor at Kartouche, by a yoof-ful gay blerk of my acquaintence, who excitedly opined - mid idle-convo - that he wanted me to meet his mates.   All unsuspecting, I was, therefore, horrified when he introduced me with the deathless line:   "This is Sasha - guess how old she is? 35!! Can you believe it? Really, she's 35 - you'd never guess, would you|??"   [Cue: fervent desire from mad-elderly that sticky-carpet part momentarily to swallow her into the darkest nether-world of beer-soaked-Kartouche-cellar oblivion]  I put it down to the fact that, when out, I am even more horrifically immature than usual - especially if I've *hem* 'had a few'. Add one dark club, one wasted, unworldly, gay-blerk, and  voila  !  you have a passable 25-year-old-slapper-goff impersonatrix!  More likely is that it's all the endless gallons of coal-tarry, slimy, greasy oog I have had to smear all over meself for the last 20 years: my skin is me nemesis.  Hopefully, though, not for much longer... *prays to dermatology faery*  So...anyway, I can't be arsed to be fucked off, so I'm being pretty happy at the moment.   I have tried taking life - and all the shittyness on the horizon - plus all the crapfullness already here - seriously; and being properly pissed off and weepy about it; but all I managed was a bit irritable and snappy. Though, even that's mostly due to almost total lack of sleep - and the nagging headache due to same.  The inmates of  Maison Slasha  keep cheering me up, the bastards...  ('Cept George who, although he brought me a present the other night, kinda let himself down by choosing a long-dead, stiff and maggotty mouse as a gift - rather than the case of vintage  Veuve Cliquot  I really deserve)  We're all having a bit of a rough time at present: we seem to take it turns to need to be silent and alone and mopey.   Well, I've kinda done a whole year's worth in the last few months; so I guess I must be due an exemption.  *grinz manaically*  See?  I laugh....  *Lauughs*  Hevva and I had sum fun the last couple of days doing 'girlie' stuff - something of a novelty for both of us. I mean: neither of us are exacly the clothes-and-nails-and-hair-and-gossip type of woman (poss. excl. the 'gossip' bit - but it has to be really good to distract us from the fascinating stuff we already have going on in our heds - and other places)   No - not very 'fluffy' or 'girlie'.     What??     *pauses to look a bit sheepish*   We were  curious , okay?   So wednesday we spent 'doing our toenails' - which turned out to be a brilliant excuse to slob out on the sofa all day watching the Star-Wars movies one after another (the proper ones - not the latest merchandising ads brought out to persuade people that they haven't already got enough useless plastic  objets  cluttering up their houses). We et scrambled egg; and some toe- and finger-nail pruning and painting definitiely did occur. Tho I later ruined mine by trolling down to the 24 hour garage with me new-rocks on before they were properly dry: I now have stylish tight-prints and squash-marks in my purple metallic polish.  *frowns*  I am a wazzock.  Anyway....  Yesterday, we died our hare with Henna: I look  normal  (my version thereof) again; and Hevva's hare, upon which we plastered a redder henna than on mine, went a spectacularly shaded spectrum of reds and oranges that looks  WAY  cool. Took an hour to put the stuff on, mind: she's got really lovely thick hare. I'm jealous: I want Hevva's hare. Preferably no longer attached to her scalp...but then, at my age, one must take what one can get.  *cackles and squints*  I'm really concerned about Hevva, actually.   I'm not sure what's going on with her at the moment: it's kinda sad, and more than a bit worrying.  Not only is she developing a warped Kebab obsession - bordering upon the fetishistic; but yesterday her early-morning greeting consisted of coming into the study while I was on the PC and offering to slap me with her dirty socks.  She was perfectly serious...  I was  quite  scared; but I coped.   I guess I must be getting used to it: the 'kebab' incident, recorded for posterity, pretty much put the tin lid on the whole 'sanity' thing - as far as that ever went.  Hahahahaaaa!!  In  other  news, Heff's PC continues to amuse, entertain and keep him occupied for days at a time, swearing, crashing about in annoyance, being grumpy and, occasionally, throwing stuff.  He had the guts out of all three of the things yesterday - mine, his and the one Dad 'donated' (read: 'dumped on us') - swapping over hard-drives, formatting things, and so forth (don't ask me, I'm tech-no-literate: I fall strictly into the happy-but-clueless-EU/button-pressing-ignoramous category).  Well, Heff may well sneer at my elderly and temperamental hamster-powered contrary and illogical machine-of-d00m-and-d357r|_|C710|\|; but at least when it's been dismantled, abused, organ-transplanted, sworn at, insulted, dropped, kicked, tripped-over and put back together, it still  actually   fucking    WORKS  !!!   Not that I'm getting a dig in, or anything...  *snorts*  I reckon my PC is essentially the computer version of my cat.  Thus, it would seem that I now accidentally collect mad, elderly, senile, awkward and insane stuff that doesn't work entirely properly.  I hope it doesn't progress too much further: I already collect coffins and skulls, which take up quite a bit of room - where would I put anything else?  Plus, as I know from Gran - to name but a single example - the elderly insane are such bloody  HARD WORK!!!   And, if I can't even be bothered to be  miserable ...?  .~*~.

       .~*~.      First time I've been online for a while - to do anything other than try and keep my hotmail account going and check the latest mong-mail from all my no mates.      Just as bloody well I haven't had time to catch up on anyone's Blog for a while...or I'd be typing this from a cell in Broadmoor.      Yes, I've been reading Nick's Blogs.      I'm not happy...      Under normal circumstances, Nick, I'd be talking to you face-to-face about this - rather than doing it in here. But, after the experience of reading your Blogs, I though an object lesson in what it feels like to be on the recieving end would do you good.      And I think you know me well enough not to expect euphemism, allusion, implication and dancing around the issue: either I keep it to myself or I call it as I see it; and, as you may be gathering about now, the hat of forbearance, sympathy and restraint has slipped quite a bit in the last day or so.      I am feeling pretty let down and furious with Nick, just at the moment.      After two months camping out in what was formerly our living-room,  he went on Saturday morning - before I was awake and without a word or a note - and  moved back to his mother's.       At the time, I felt more than a bit bad about him having to go at two-weeks notice. However, the ITSC put his foot down on the basis that 1. it was only s'posed to be for a couple of weeks; 2. it meant the renovations had ground to a complete halt due to lack of space; and 3. his insurance wouldn't cover the 4 of us in the house; and his accountant and lawyer are doing their respective nuts because he's losing so much money on the house and, insurance-wise, is  personally  liable if anything happened to/because of Nick.      Dee had been getting more and more antsy with me for a couple of weeks about Nick still being here. He's anxious to remortgage and save some money on the place, and he can't do that while there's no plaster on the walls, a bloody great hole in the hall ceiling, and plaster coming off in chunks around the window in the spare room. To be honest, I could have done without the hassle from Dee: the pressure and guilt were starting seriously to fuck with my head.      Still: it's yer mates, innit? You do what you can to help 'em, right?       So I wheedled and persuaded for a while and got Dee to be a bit patient; but, finally, after two months, he put his foot down.      There was nothing I could do - tho lord knows I tried; and I felt terrible about Nick - I felt like I was somehow 'dropping him in the shit', and felt pretty bad as a result.      Luckily - for Nick - at the time this was going on, I had no idea that Nick was feeling so persecuted and abused by being temporarily housed at our expense; nor that he was taking time out of his hectic schedule to share this with the rest of the planet....without, of course, bothering to share any of it with me, face-to-face.      I didn't know:  why the fuck would I? He'd been as nice as pie to me the whole time - even after Dee gave him his marching orders. I can't believe I actually thanked him for taking it so well and told him how grateful I was that he'd been so nice about it.      Now I find that, after being a guest in our home, all he can do in return is blog about how inconvenient it was for him and how mean and unreasonable we were to him.      I mean: it was only s'posed to be for a few nights - a couple of weeks at the most. And yes, it is tough to find a house when you're on benefit - I know coz I've tried.      However, he wasn't actually   on   benefit when he moved in here. That didn't happen 'till he decided to pack in his job - before finding anywhere else to live.      Still, he's a mate; he's having a hard time: you take deep breaths and make allowances, yeah?       Even though we're only living on benefit ourselves; and I'm still finding things tough on the mental front; and have a few other difficult issues to deal with at the moment, too; and despite the inconvenience of losing the living room, privacy, space, the freedom to vacuum at 3am if I wanted to and unlimited access to my own PC - even just to write, I was anxious not to add to Nick's woes by asking him to leave.      So, here he is for two months: taking up half the downstairs of our house, living rent-free, bill-free, not having to pay council tax, being fed quite often, able to drink his way through the beer we had left over from the party, and not having to pay for the 'net access he needs so desparately to keep in touch with Rainah.      I understand how important this is to him.       So much so, that I was prepared to live with the fact that I hardly ever got to spend more than an hour or so online myself as, by the time I'd done whatever I had to do in the way of hospital, gynecologist and shrink visits, shopping, family duties etc., it was time for Rainah to come online and I'd let Nick on my PC instead.      Not that you'd know this, from the extensive whining and bitching about it that appears in his blog: you'd never guess the hours and hours he got to spend, uninterrupted, online talking to her; you'd never guess that the whole household went out of their way to make sure that he got first call on the only net-access PC wherever possible.       Not every single time, sure - that would be a little unreasonable to ask, the rest of us needing to get a go sometimes as well; but most of the time, we respected that he needed to speak to Rainah and didn't mind.      Then again, to read his blogs, you'd never guess that it was my PC, or that I mostly use it for writing rather than online stuff, either.      Come to that, you'd never work out that he was a guest in the house - rather than a fully rent-paying, legal and above-board tenant, with rights to anything he pleased or chose to do - up to and including paranoid bitching about the decisions, attitudes and lifestyles of his fellow tenants, and their terrible impact on his already impossible life - either.      Now, I know Nick's got problems; but, to be fair, quite a few of his current ones are the product of his own decisions. And he's relatively healthy and capable - albeit a bit pissed off and low; but hardly clinically depressed, or anything  like  that - and he has family to support him.      So what I wanna know is this: if we, and life in this house, was so bloody onerous, why the   fuck   did he stay here so long, costing us money and causing us  hassle and inconvenience?       If we are such awful, insensitive, selfish people, how could he, in all conscience, accept our hospitality at all - seeing as he had a perfectly serviceable mother just up the road?      Ok, so I didn't want, or expect,  gratitude - tho even a single 'thank-you', after two months' residence, would have been appreciated; but I  really  didn't expect that, having offered him support and a place to stay when he needed it - however inconvenient he may have found the situation in reality - I'd  read his blog and find he'd been publically bitching and whining about us, and generally behaving as though we'd pissed all over his life just for a laugh.      I am really quite shocked and upset - especially considering that he's so hot, himself, on people being upfront, honest and saying what they think, yet never said a   single word   to me about any of the difficulties he was having that appear in his blog.      The one time he did alert me to his feelings was on his blog - the entry where he was feeling all sorry for himself coz he couldn't get online, had offered to fix the PC and no-one had taken him up on it.      So I explained that.       Overlooking the fact that, as it's my PC and my house and I'm paying for the damn connection, he really didn't have a RIGHT to expect - let alone demand -  anything , I left a comment on his blog, explaining how it was realted to a relationship issue between Heff and I that he didn't understand; that it was really quite important to us as a couple; and that we were  all  inconvenienced by the lack of 'net access but that it was getting fixed so he'd just have to be patient.      Tho I noticed today that the comment's not there anymore. A bit too rational perhaps: the context explaining the situation in a way that cast his complaints in a not-especially-favourable light?      I don't know what the Hell's going on with Nick at the moment.       He's never been like this before. He's had problems, sure - and worse than these; but he's always faced up to them and sorted them out himself. I used to admire him for his sense of responsibility, self-possession and grace under fire - before, that is, he decided that kicking his mates in the teeth in return for their help was a better way to go.      He seems to be living in a Universe with himself at the centre, these days: no-one else appears to deserve anything of consideration, compassion or loyalty. It looks like he thinks he needs to save it all for himself; and that's it's okay not only to take anything offered completely for granted, but also to treat every inconvenience he experience as some kind of studied insult or deliberate obstruction.       He's acting as if he's got - and has had - a so much harder time than everyone else.  Jesus, compared to what  some  people have gone through, he's never had a single day's grief in his life; and the Nick I used to know would have cheerfully acknowledged that. Everybody's got problems: no-one's are worse than anyone else's are to them; and it certainly doesn't give anyone the right to feel they're owed anything from anyone else; let alone that they can be forgiven treating others with disregard, contempt and disrespect .      Under other circumstances, I would be quite worried about Nick: he's not himself - unless I am a really shitty judge of character.      Frankly, tho,  after what's happened I've little sympathy - in fact, I've just about had a gutfull of him acting as though we have no idea how tough his life is but expecting that everyone else should somehow be able psychically to intuit how he's feeling and make endless allowances for him.       Fuck, materially  we're  no better off than him - though he seems to  think that all we're doing is sitting around on our arses sponging off the government for the hell of it.  He should have my life for the last eighteen months - if he thinks it's tough now, he should try being trapped in the house for six months, unable to do even the most basic things for himself, and coming round every so often to find he hasn't a clue where he is, how he got there, what the hell he's done - or even what day it is.       But, in the end, it's not even fury or compassion fatigue I'm feeling: I just feel like someone I trusted, and went the extra mile for, just bent me over, arse-fucked me with a hot poker, and then dropped me in the nearest fetid gutter and walked away.      Besides, it's obvious that he's more than capable of taking care of himself - or rather, finding someone else to bail him out of his shit, while he complains about them coz nothing's easy or quite perfect enough for him.        If determined self-pity counts for anything, he'll be just fine.      At least, as long as his 'virtual' friends don't turn out to be as fucking nasty, useless and unsympathetic as he obviously feels his 'real-life' ones have been.       .~*~.
