      Atrophy:  A wasting away or decrease in size or function of an organ, muscle or body part due to disease, injury or lack of use.    Went back to yoga yesterday which proved to be quite telling.  First bad sign was that after first agonizing 10 minutes it dawned on me that the class hadn't indeed started yet and that basically the "pose" that my class mates seemed able to do with such ease was actually everyone just "sitting there".  I almost got discouraged when realized couldn't even do "Mountain Pose"  which is basically just "standing there";  it's not even standing "up straight" and I still couldn't do it.  I was all round and folded over.  When my milk came in during "Cow" pose, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.   I hung in there though and was glad for the balance and strength I found within myself the rest of the day.  Rigor Mortis:  Muscular stiffening following death or, in this case, childbirth.

      TO DO List:  Thank you cards. Clean House Review 401 K and revise if now is 201K Call Dr. to set appt for Andy to quit smoking Look up extended warranty plan on laptop & bring in for service Research kindergarten options for 4 yo Plan baptism for 4 mo Make Breakfast, lunch, dinner for 4 people Exercise/lose weight floss teeth Bank   Is Saturday and Andy finally has the day off.  V stressed though and only wants to watch Red Sox vs. Yankees in playoffs.  Don't blame him really.  Am off to by DVD for 4yo as have promised for 1 week.  So tired and just in no mood to even move off couch.  Have not told Andy about broken spider veined laptop computer.  His solution is to buy  home w/addit'l br/office.  Why is this a $600,000 problem?    Gave 4 mo cereal yesterday and today.  read somewhere  not supposed to give babies solids until 6 months.  Now feel guilty as visions of stomach ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome haunt my thoughts.  Just got over guilt trip from herniated belly button resultant from use of diapers w/o cord cut-out protection.  Thought for sure that was marketing gimick created by fear producing culture.  Wish someone had warned me about the rampant guilt of motherhood.  Well, can't avoid trip to video store any longer so must sign off.

      Good news!  tried new deodorant and no longer stink.  Bad news!  It's husband's Old Spice.  Good News!  Got car washed for $35 at work.  Supposed to be huge convenience.  Bad News!  Mark the Car Wash dude took off sun protection screens, misaligned baby's car seat and dismantled 2 way mirror system for watching baby in car.  Turned out to be huge inconvenience.    Have been carrying around diaper bag, pocket book, laptop computer, briefcase and breast pump.  Am so stressed out and exhausted that fear might start breast feeding my clients and pitching ad campaigns to newborn.  Have streamlined down to just the diaper bag (which doubles as purse) and  breast pump.  Now that new deodorant is working noticed odd smell coming from cubicle.  Discovered it was 3 day old dirty diaper in pocketbook/diaper bag.  Must try and un-do evil rumor mongering about flatulant co-worker.      Stepped on laptop today while walking baby in dark room.  Now screen has big spider veins.  Must determine whether is worth it to take it in for free repairs.  Don't know if I can spare the time seeing as barely have time to think lately.

      ztold co-worker that have 2nd job as Group Home Director at an Assisted Living Facility.  Thought that anyone w/a brain would get it but workmate is kinda dumb and asked more questions.  I continued to regale him with the drudgery of my nights/weekend job..."you know, I provide assisted living services to a small but active resident population including a domestically disabled 41 yo male and his 2 children". "2 of the residents require round the clock supervision and the 41 yo male is just well, hopeless."  Figured by then for sure he knew of my ruse but apparently is just so stupid because asked me yesterday did I work this weekend?!  These guys make me crazy;  they come to work with their pressed suits after their nutritionally balanced breakfasts and spend the whole day trying to get other people to do their work whilst complaining that they deserve more money.  They must be stopped!    thank you cards written:  0 bills mailed:    0 calories consumed: 1000000000000000 ants in house:  1000000000000000000 exercise:  ran amock between broken copiers household chores completed:  0  Matthew brought me a flower today!  so cute!  Alyssa & Matthew took a tubby together.  so sweet!  It felt nice to have a Norman Rockwell (instead of Andy Warhol) moment w/them.  And I;ve realized what a myth it all is.  We're all force fed this ideal that doesn't exist.  But at the same time, maybe that's the truth of it all.  That it does exist in all the small little mundane places of one's day.  Where one minute you're plunging the toilet and the next your 5 yo son who you could've sworn the last time you turned around was really just a few months old is now picking flowers for you!  And your a mom w/a house and a husband and 2 kids who take their baths together.

      Went away last weekend for family reunion and bah mitzvah in No. Cal.  Returned to find out that after 4 days, neighbor who was watching kitties found gas stove on in smoke filled house.  Thank God have cats or probably would've burnt house down.   Fled w/kids so night shift working Dad could sleep in; spent 7 hours as refugees roaming streets of San Diego in effort to stay out of house.  Ended up at 7-11 buying slurpees and was confounded to learn that somehow have become redneck family as both kids were running around convenience store barefoot w/slurpees on 4th of July weekend.  Went to mall as last resort for homesite noise control.  Forgot stroller.  Lost 5 yo in Nordstrom.  It dawned on me when security guards were posted at every door and the store was in lock down that perhaps am not doing the best job as Mother when have nearly burnt down house and lost kid in less than 1 week.    Was kicked in boob by 1 yo  who wanted to run around Nordstrom like older brother.  So, 4th of July weekend which was supposed to be spent at SD County Fair; beach; pool parties and Spiderman 2 has resulted in Breast infection; fevers; chills; sweats; headaches; body aches; puking and overall lethargy.    Thank you cards written for Matt's bday:  0 Thank you cards written for 'Lyssa's bday: 0
