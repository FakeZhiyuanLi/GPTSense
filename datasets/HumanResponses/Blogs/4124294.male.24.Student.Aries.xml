      I'm pretty excited today...I'm going to a party later, and it has a theme of "Pirates and Wenches", hahahaaha! I'm not sure I'm going to actually dress up (God knows I might end up looking more like a wench than a pirate, if my wardrobe is any indicator), but it should be heaps of fun! I'll post some pics up if and when I take them.  Meanwhile, the house is smelling of cookies 'cos my housemate Judi has just baked oatmeal ones: low-fat, low-sugar, high in goodness, she says. She should be a copywriter. Heheh. Judi and I were meant to go out shopping today, but I cancelled the plans...she wanted me to own a pair of "gay pants" - i.e. pants that are tight enough to "show off" (yeah, right) thighs, legs and butt whilst being simultaneously comfortable and fashionable. Everything I own is too  baggy , she insists vehemently and with a vengeance.  If you've got it, flaunt it!  she shrieks.   I don't got it. _____________________________  Meanwhile, five music clips still available for download! Check out the "Nick's Music" link on the right. Would appreciate it if you let me know what you think! Thanks!

      Having gone to rehearsal yesterday (see previous post), I was very impressed with the strings players that my friend has sought help from -- they're really, really good, and they brought out a very nice sound to some of the stuff I'd written for them. If only there was a way for some of you to have a sample of my work...   Oh wait!    Well, guess what! I've managed to find a way to upload some demos so that you guys and girls may download them! Yaay!  So at long last, please check out some of my demos written for various projects. At this time there are only five, but I'll add more as time goes by. A disclaimer, though, is that these songs were all recorded using my keyboard with only my vocals on top (which aren't great); so bear in mind that they are only  demos,  which might contain mistakes, mis-tunes and mis-writings.  Okay, without further ado... please check out  urlLink My Music  for downloads! Also added it to the links in the sidebar. Cheers boys and girls!

      I have been feeling a little homesicky lately, I'm not sure why. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I've been in Perth since February without going home -- but that seems to be a rather pathetic reason, considering it's only been a few months, not a few years. And it's not like I've not been away from home for a whole year before -- I did it in 1999, when I was studying in Sydney. Still, I've been having dreams lately about being at home... and a couple of months ago, my dog died while I was here, which makes it  two  dogs in two years who've moved on while I was away. I dunno. I'm just in that kinda mood, I guess. Hopefully this will pass soon.  Anyway, onto brighter and cheerier topics...  *strains hard to think of something* ...   Tonight I have rehearsals for a friend's recording project. Y'see, he's an audio engineering student, and his assignment involves recording and mixing songs; so he asked me to pen a couple of tunes for him. So yeah, tonite we have the entire band practice  with  a mini orchestra: four violins and two cellos -- and I have to play one of the violin parts, in spite of my better judgment. I used to study playing the violin, for just four years...so my playing isn't up to much, and it inevitably sounds like cats mating whenever the bow hits the strings. Heh. Still, I guess practice makes perfect. And I've played the violin (badly) during church services. The congregation always seems more prayerful when I do that. I wonder why.  Anyway, here's a photo of me, my housemate Judi (right), and my dear friend Berni, taken sometime last year. Until next time!

      Right now as I type this, I'm stuffing my face with spicy Tom Yum noodle soup. Made in Australia. It's not half bad, but somehow ... I don't know, "local" food away from the locale seems to taste different, as if something is ... lacking. Even when the stores are run by supposed Singapore or Malaysian people in Perth, I somehow find it unlike the stuff we get at home. Maybe it's psychological, I dunno. But I'm sure many people understand where I'm coming from with this. I guess it's not just the food, but it's the atmosphere as well -- the hustle and bustle of noisy kopitiams, redolent with the odours of Malaysian and Western foods aplenty. The blind coming by to seek donations; the buskers who sing out of tune; the lottery-ticket sellers; the kopitiam workers who most times ignore you when you need to order a drink, and only come running when it's time to pay up; the pirated VCD stalls nearby lighting up the five-foot-ways; the occasional night market packed with throngs of people who aren't there to do anything but kill time; the frequently unbalanced tables perched precariously by roadsides where at any moment a lunatic Malaysian driver could ram into you and kill you... it's all part of the fun. It's all part of the eating experience. And I'm sorry, no offence to the Perthlings, but  that's  what might be lacking. Strange, isn't it, how the environment affects our tastebuds...  Here's a little online hug for my pal Jase and his little (or not so little) car crash. Thankfully he's fine. Check out his blog in the link section. And here's a wave to Dave and Vincci, two old friends back in my studying days in Sydney (that's a story for another time), who I've had the pleasure of reestablishing contact with online. Cheers to you guys! :) And finally, salutations and heartfelt bitchiness to Terry, of course! Heh! Buhbye for now!

      Whew! Finally able to get back online, after a confusing screw-up with my ADSL provider... it's a long story, something to do with a muck-up in their computer which made them think I hadn't paid my previous bill even though I actually  had.  Had to call them and naturally wait for hours for them to finally patch me through to a consultant... stupid sales and services technicians, they're all the same,  all  of them! Grr! Arrgh! No offence to those who work in this line. Grr!  Anyway, over the weekend I joined my church group (yes, I'm part of a church group) on a retreat to a "hideaway" somewhere east of Perth. It was pretty fun, driving over an hour to this deserted little place smack in the middle of a hilly forest, where temperatures dropped to chilling 0.4 degrees at night (which made for some really uncomfortable sleeping moments, let me tell you!) The cool thing about this place was that there weren't any cabins or house-like structures; instead, we slept in train carriages that had obviously been taken off the rails and used as shelters. Of course the carriages came equipped with all the necessities like electricity and plumbing (thank God). All in all, a good time!  Well, that's about all for now. I had to juggle going on this retreat with the ton of uni assignments I had to get done, and  that  wasn't fun. Meanwhile, I just got home from watching a comedy,  Connie & Carla.  Anyone seen it? It's about a couple of women fleeing a bunch of murderers, so they hide out in a drag bar pretending to be drag queens. Yup. Women playing men playing women. It stars Nia wotever her name is, the chick from  My Big Fat Greek Wedding,  as well as David Duchovny, a.k.a. ex -X-Files  dude Mulder. Queers and cross-dressers galore, in a mindless two-hour romp. Not a bad way to spend a Wednesday night. Heh.

      Today being Friday the 13th reminds me of a TV show that I used to really, really enjoy back in the late 80s. Some of you might remember it - it was called  Friday the 13th: The Series,  or, back in Malaysia, was known as  The Curse  (originality and creativity in titles are seriously overrated). The show revolved around a young woman, Micki, and her cousin Ryan, who inherit an antique store from their late uncle Lewis. Micki and Ryan decide to sell all the items in it -- and  then  they discover that their dead uncle had made a deal with the devil (uh-huh), causing every item in the shop to be cursed. Now they have to run around looking for each item, with every episode involving a different cursed object. The freaky thing is that the owners of these antiques are able to use them for dark, evil purposes, usually for personal gain.  In episode one, our intrepid heroes go after a little girl with a cursed doll with a malevolent personality. In other episode, a plain-faced lady uses a mirror to "blind" men into falling in love with her. The downside? She has to kill them after she has had her way with them, in the most gruesome ways imaginable. In yet another episode, the owner of a cursed glove discovers it has the ability to heal, giving him popularity in the form of a faith healer by laying his gloved hand on someone. The bad side is that he has to "transfer" the diseases on to someone else by touching them -- and these diseases will be ten times worse than when they started. Many episodes involving a range of different objects led to a series that was creative, original, and downright scary for its time. It was one of those ideas that allowed for a seemingly  endless  array of plots -- after all, anything from a pen to a computer mouse (which wasn't all that popular then, haha!) could be used for dark and dastardly purposes.  Some of the episodes that I still remember fondly are such as the Scarecrow, which would come alive to kill victims targeted by its owner; the Mulcher, a gardening machine that would deposit money if a dead body were put into it; the Tattoo Needles, which could make its tattoos come to life (a horrible scorpion scene, I can recall); the Boxing Gloves, with which a fighter is guaranteed to win because while he is pummelling his opponent, his  shadow  (a play on shadow-boxing) is out beating innocent people to death; the Dentist's Chair, which gave its owner the power of electrokinesis; the Magic Boxes, which allowed a magician's assistant in one box to survive the most deadly of stunts involving spikes, glass, etc, while an innocent in another box endures the suffering; and the Camera, which allowed its owner to make a duplicate of   himself, providing an alibi while he went about killing people.  Sadly, though, the series was only shown up til around the end of Season One in Malaysia, and ended after Season Three elsewhere due to it being too dark (plots dealing with the occult are always a risky venture). Still, the episodes that I remember viewing were very entertaining, occasionally gory, and sometimes downright freaky. Here are some pictures that I stole from another website. Heh.    Scary little girl with scarier playmate.     The scarecrow walks at night...     The 'black widow' uses the mirror to blind potential lovers.   If I'm not mistaken, several episodes are available on video in Malaysia -- so if you've got nothing better do to, why not check it out? The quality of the filming and writing might be a little dated now, but I'm sure it would still add some chills and thrills to your Friday the 13th. Have a good one, boys and girls!

      Grr! Arrgh! My computer back home is down again. At least, the internet connection is. I thought ADSL was supposed to be a faultless concept, grrr! This is  not  a good day! Anyway, I'm at uni now, getting all stressed out over assignments and lack of time to do all the things I really wanna do which could be construed as time-wasting. Y'know, things like stuffing my face with junk food, lounging about while reading, staring at the ceiling, stuff like that. Sigh. Oh well, I have to get back home to work on another project for school (I'm in uni right now, in the overstuffy computer lab)... so I'll leave you with a silly cartoon, drawn by yours truly.    For another cartoon, click  urlLink here  and  urlLink here !

      Hihihi! So much for keeping a regularly-updated blog, huh? Heh. Five days have zoomed by since my last entry, and if you were to ask me what I've been up to, all I can do is scratch my head and go, "I dunno." Actually, I've been rather sniffly lately, it's been freezing over here, and wet, so the flu has descended upon poor ol' me. That, and trying to juggle work for uni -- it's getting really hectic. So yeah. That's basically been the past few days. *sigh*  Have been meaning to work on this site a bit more, maybe put up a message board and sidebar lists and stuff like that. As soon as I work out how to do it, it'll happen, I promise. Dunno when, dunno how, but it  will  happen. Heh.  Finally, let me leave you with a few candid photos from the last production that I was involved in here at Murdoch Uni, a musical aimed at children entitled  Athena Emu at the Olympics.  I wrote the music and lyrics and had to work with a very talented group of musicians to get the songs together, and all in all, I dare say we did well (in all modesty, hehehe) -- even in the face of such dubious titles as  Hermes Where the Heart Is, Everybody Loves A Boy Band,  and, everybody's all-time favourite,  The Pussy Song.  Meow!      The baddies in the play, fully-costumed.         Some of the cast rehearsing for an acrobatic dance scene.          Promotional photo of the character of Zeus, played by my pal Stan Schirmer.        Me, Peta and Andrew, three members of the band.        A photo of my good friend Paul, all dolled up in the character of Zorba the Fox.        The cockatoos: from left, Michelle, Teej, someone and Jess. I forget the third girl's name. Whoops. *blushes*

      Just a quick post for tonight because my muse isn't being very inspirational tonight. The house smells of instant noodles -- my housemate just cooked supper. It's weird, isn't it? We move out of home, study in a new environment, have the opportunity to be independent and learn new skills and gain new experiences -- and we blow it all by popping Maggi Mi into the microwave.  Ah well.  More later today! Byebye for now!

      Okay, it's 5pm, and the shops are still open because it's Thursday, when it's late-night shopping here in most suburban areas! Yaay! However, I'm really short on money. Boo! In fact, had a grand total of MINUS AUS$50 in the bank account. And then they slap me with a penalty for overwithdrawal, a whopping $45. I banked in $100 and ended up with $5 in the bank. I love my life. Grr. Arrgh.  Anyway, I'm gonna talk a bit more on some of the productions I've been in here at uni. I'll leave the children's shows for later, but right now I wanna touch on the show that was staged in November 2003. It's a famous enough show: Shakespeare's  Richard III.  I was asked to write some songs for it, and I thought,  Hmm, okay. Shouldn't be too difficult.  And then the director tells me, "It's  Richard III,  done as a musical, set in an Indian nightclub. Meaning I'm looking for Bollywood."  Bollywood. Oh gawsh. Now, I enjoy a good Bollywood movie as much as the next average Malaysian, but to be composing songs that  sound  like they come from a Bollywood film...  that  was tricky. Especially since I'm not Indian, and I didn't have many friends familiar with the music here in Perth. Not to mention the fact that any access to Bollywood albums and movies was severely limited by my location. What made it harder was the fact that the director wanted to use existing songs such as  Thunderstruck  by AC/DC and  Going to the Chapel,  that oldie by...I-don't-know-who, and then  rearrange  these songs so that they  sound Indian.  Suffice it to say, I balked. I told him it would be a lot easier for me to write  original  music that  intentionally  sound Bollywoodesque, rather than try to alter  unoriginal  songs into Hindi-film music. The director was sceptical, but in the end, he agreed.  Did I succeed? I don't know. I wrote songs, threw in the occasional sitar sound effect from my Technics SX-KN2400 keyboard, mucked about with percussion, included strains of Indian-style scales and note progressions that honestly sounded more Middle Eastern than Bollywood, and basically managed to  deceive  the director into believing it sounded Bollywood. In comparison, I think my songs sounded  nothing  like Bollywood - but nobody in the cast and crew of  Richard III  was really knowledgable on the authenticities of the genre anyway, and so they believed I was successful. And I let them believe it. Why not.  The show went well (despite backstage politics, a story for another time); the set and design was megaflashy and megacolourful, and the music was well-appreciated, thank God. Sadly we didn't get to do a recording of the show, although I  do  have demo files of some of the songs in my computer. Now if there was a way for me to upload these files as Mp3s or something, I'd do it. I'm sure there is. But that's a skill to be learnt some other time, so in the meanwhile, any of you who are intrigued by the faux Bollywood material I've come up with must wait just a little while longer.  Still, here are some photos. Ahh, the good old days. Those of you with low downloading... um... bandwidth...thingy.... I apologise. :)      Above: Some of the cast practising choreography during the workshops and rehearsals.        Above: The opening scene of the show, during which the Bollywood-style music abruptly segues into a hip-hop rap number. Don't ask.                More scenes from the show.        A cheesy promotional shot of me, in costume. Erk.   And below: the poster for the show.               All photos (C)2003 by S. Tampalini    For those who are interested, here's a  urlLink link  to a review of the show. Ignore the rest of the posts in that forum, they're largely irrelevent to the review.  Okay, that's it for now! ___________________   PS: Hello to Sarah, who visited this blog recently!! :)

      Another new day. I'm sitting in the computer lab of Murdoch University in Perth as I type this, waiting for my next class to begin. Twenty minutes to go. I thought I'd mention what I've been doing here education-wise. I'm currently trying (and struggling through) to obtain my Masters of Arts in the fields of Public Relations, Journalism and Performance. Quite simply put, it's a combination of Mass Communications (PR & Journo) and English (Drama).  Wot a weird mix,  some of you might think, but that's not necessarily the case. At least, I don't think it is.  You see, I've always been keen on writing work, whether it's journalism or contemporary creative writing. And, as the title of the blog says, I like to make music; that is, I enjoy composing songs, stuff like that. Last year I embarked on my English degree here at Murdoch and discovered the excitement of theatre and live performances, and as such, my aim in my studies is to write an original script suitable for stage performance, and compose songs to accompany the script. In short, I aim to write a musical. That would cover the Performance side of the degree. On top of that, I have to document the entire publicity process: the press releases, the news articles, the interviews, etc. That would cover the Mass Comm side of things. And when you think about it, in trying to promote any sort of event, publicity is the key. Hence from where I'm sitting, Mass Communications and Drama make an interesting and complementary combination. [Meanwhile, I've just reread the above sentences and realised how formal and "academic" they sound. See what happens when you spend too much time writing essays and stuff? Jeez. Sorry about that. Heheh.] __________________________  Anyway, that hopefully explains a bit of what I'm doing educationwise, although most days, when you're in a theatre environment with a whole bunch of loud, extroverted drama and creative writing students, it's hard to remember that it is, at the very heart of it, an education. For those who are interested, I've been involved so far in writing the songs for three shows at Murdoch Uni, two of which were plays aimed at children. I'll post more on these later, but again, when you're interacting with actors who get dressed up in animal costumes and sing songs that sound like a combination of  Bananas in Pajamas  and the pseudo-pop sentimentalities of Disney animations, it's not surprising that you might stop, reflect, and think,  I can't believe I'm doing this for a postgraduate qualification . It's surreal. It really is. If any of you out there are studying with a sense of surrealism as well, drop me a line, let's talk about it. :) Cheers.

      I'm sitting here waiting for my housemate Jo to finish up with her shower so that we can catch up on reruns of the old hit  Babylon 5 . Do you remember the good ol' days when  B5  was being shown on TV2 (after  The X-Files  and  Time Trax , if memory serves me correctly)? Well, I'm not sure how many of you caught the plot back then, knowing TV2's lack of organisation in screening episodes in the past (and even now, maybe? Dunno. Don't wanna be sued for defamation, though, so I'll leave it at that). The thing is, if you watch  B5  from the first episode of the first season to the final episode of Season 5  in sequence,  you'll be blown away by what an accomplishment that sci-fi series was. Heck, you don't even need to start from Season 1 Ep 1 --  I  didn't; I popped in halfway during  B5 's explosive third season and was immediately hooked.  What's so great about the series?  some of you might ask. Admittedly, it wasn't much to look at -- despite being created in the 90s, some of the graphics were clearly dated and could have been done a shiteload better. But let's glance across that and look at the  plot. Mein Gott,  the plot.   B5  was written primarily by the creator of the series, J. Michael Straczynski, who planned the skeleton of the series' entire plot and subplots to span over a period of four years (it eventually ended up being five when it was renewed for a fifth season). In other words, episode plots were thought out  waaaay  in advance. Something that was mentioned in Season 1 would suddenly happen in Season 4, and when they show you flashbacks to those older episodes that hinted on said event, it's a cause to gasp and go, "Ohhh,  that's  what they meant when they said that!" The mysterious reappearance of the shuttle Babylon 4 during a Season 1 episode had dramatic repercussions for the crew of Babylon 5 during the series' third season. The instances are plenty, but the point here is that for someone to create what is essentially a five-year  miniseries,  it's no easy task. It's downright impressive and enthralling.  So yeah, even if you remember  B5  as something of a visual flop, if you ever get a chance to review the episodes (available now on DVD from your online international shopping website!), give it a go. If you like sci-fi, you'll definitely be blown away. And if you don't, you might still find something of interest in the inherent political symbolisms that constitute the plots of  Babylon 5  -- a topic I shall reserve for another time, as my housemate has just knocked on the door clad in a towel, saying, " B5  in ten minutes, move your ass."  I'm moving.

      Okay! So it's another day. This whole blogging business is pretty interesting; I'm learning new stuff on how to do all sorts of things with it. The latest lesson is uploading photos, which might not seem like a big deal to those of you who are extremely experienced in the joy of doing that, but it  is  for technophobes such as myself! Heheh.  Anyway, today I woke up at 12pm, and I asked myself,  What's going on?  Ah, the plight of being a student living away from home. I'm sure many of you can empathise with the notion of going to bed at 4am and waking up with the sun high, high, high up in the sky - especially when all your classes are in the afternoon, leaving you only the evenings and the nights to do your homework and research and whatnot.  The problem with being here in Perth is, unlike Malaysia, shops shut by 5pm on most days - which means, of course, that by getting up at noon and going to classes, there leaves very little time for one to go out and do anything in the way of mingling with the outside world. By the time I walk out of class at 4:30pm, I realise I only have half an hour to go down to the local supermarket to buy, say, a roll of toilet paper. Believe you me, it can be a shitty situation. Of course, the way out would be to wake up earlier - but that would imply going to  bed  earlier as well. The problem with me is, I'm stuck in a routine. I can't sleep before 4am. I try, but I can't. Lie in bed and stare at the cobwebby ceiling, with all sorts of thoughts going through my head. I look at the clock, and it's 2AM. I stare some more. Toss. Turn. Look at the clock, and it's 3AM. Stare. Toss. Turn. And then, just as I am drifting off, I realise it's 4, and the cycle begins again. Oh, the humanity. Anyway, fellow late-nighters, keep me company by leaving comments or emailing me, or adding me on to MSN at nickmaniac@hotmail.com. It's all fun.  Hmm. Maybe I should've repeated the above paragraph to myself. Might've helped me doze off easier.  _________  And finally, in the spirit of egocentricity, may I attempt to put up an image, testing my newly-acquired photo-uploading skill! A photo of me and a flashy digital camera that  isn't  mine. Oh well.

      Welcome, boys and girls!  Having been inspired by many wonderful friends out there who are actively blogging away, I thought it might be cool for me to commence on a blog of my own. Rightaway I can see how this might be a fun/interesting/challenging/boring/dreary exercise, depending on what kind of mood I'm in, and how much the good ol' brain is willing to think up as I sit and stare glazed-eyed at the computer screen. Still, my cool friends out there who are actively blogging away somehow manage to actively blog away every night, churning out the most fascinating anecdotes on life, love and other disasters, and I see this as motivation to give this a go.  Right.  Now what?  Well, I guess first off I should say I'm extremely lacking in computer skills, which is news that should encourage  lots  of people to check out this blog, if only to make fun of all the errors that I'm bound to make. So nothing overly creative HTML-wise, folks, ok? For starters, at least. Heh.  Right now, I'm sitting in a cold room in a house that I share with three others in Perth, Australia, where I'm currently studying. Don't wish to bore anyone with the sordid details of my academic life (or lack of) right now, so I'll talk more about this later (lest people leave me messages pleading for me  not  to). I've entitled this blog Memoirs of a Mad Malaysian Musicmaker, but I'm not sure exactly how much I'll be talking about Malaysia (since I'm not there at the moment, although lots of retrospective and nostalgic reflections will be made, I figure); or musicmaking (since it's an aspiration, and not, y'know, my livelihood or anything). I probably  will  touch on madness though. Madness is good. Madness is fun, keeps life exciting, keeps ya on ya toes. Just ask any one of my cool friends who are actively blogging away. They're mad. All of 'em.  Yes, siree.  I think I'll stop here.  Thanks for reading, and if you'd like to read more exciting blogs, check out my buddy  urlLink Jase 's ... he's one of those cool friends who are actively blogging away.  ...  All right, all right, he's my  only  cool friend who is actively blogging away.   I need to read more blogs.   Buhbye!
