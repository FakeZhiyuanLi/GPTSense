      Hello there people.  I knew it wouldnt be long before i cut down the amount of time i spend on this site&nbsp;to write a new blog. But anyway, how ya'll doin? Good i hope!  &nbsp;  I start work tommorow on my induction day. It'll show me what working theres going to be like. I'm looking forward till the first 2 weeks are up because their my trial period and if i dont impress them then i'm outta there, so i need to make a good impression. The bad thing about working there is that i get paid monthly. I was hoping at least fortnightly, but oh well at least i'm working.   So, when you have the money, what do you do with it?  If you dont spend it, then its gonna keep building up and up, which is a good thing but it gets to you when you know its there, and you wanna spend it, but for some reason you cant. Personally i'd love to have loads of money, as would other people, so i could buy all the things i wanted to. But if you did spend it, your not gonna have any savings for something big.  &nbsp;  I've just paid off my dad for my new phone, which is great by the way! Its got video on it, which is kool. I've already got footage of my mom moaning, which i keep playing back to her. I've still gotta pay off my dad for my old phone. I did already buy it once, but i threw it at the wall which kinda smashed it into thousands of pieces. Wasnt all my fault though, my brother wanted it and i kept saying no but he wouldnt take that as an answer so i just threw it at the wall. At least he didnt get it!   Anyway, Wednesday night me, Martin, Joe, Firth and Sam went bowling (Ross made a brief appearance) and i wasnt planning on bowling. So i sat through the first game and decided i wanted to play the 2nd game with them. So i went up to the counter and she said that was OK so she done it. But when she told me the price i thought something was a bit strange. Martin told me to show her my NUS card, but she said it was too late. So i actually paid for the 2 games anyway, but i had to play one whole game on my own. Well i say it was one whole game on my own, but it was actually everyone bowling for 2 turns, all on me! What a rip off, what a con! But i was pleased that i beat the self proclaimed unbeatable Sam, which kinda made it worth the money. It wasnt even my money, i lent it from my brother and i thought i could of paid him back £4 out of the £5 he lent me and get the other pound another time, but i was left with £1.   I already knew it but i found out a couple of things about Sam.  1) He cant sit still for more than half an hour without throwing things and going silly.  2) He's a sore loser   Just to elaborate on that last one:  At Bowling he knew i was beating him after i got my second strike in a row, and when i got my third strike in a row, he tried to foul it so it wouldnt count therefore making him the winner. Then when the second game started he fouled it. But what goes around comes around, and Martin, Andrew and Ross (dunno where Joe was)&nbsp;all helped out to foul Sams go. That was one of the best things i've seen my friends do for me. Thanks guys. And no thanks to you Sam you stupid tw*t.   I think nows about the right time to do my 6th and 5th most irritating things:   6) Well i have to say this one:&nbsp; Sore losers : Basically this is just people that cant admit they lost, and they have to take it on on something or someone, or get their ownback on the person that whooped their ass.   5)  Football : I'm going to upset a lot of people here by saying this, but i just hate it. To me, its the same thing everytime a match is played. It doesnt seem very fun to me and i hate playing it, watching it and listening to other people talk about it. I'd like to think its an advantage to my future wife, because we all know that most women hate footie. And dont say i'm a woman, because i have male genitals to prove it, lol! If this top ten thing was in the order that they irritate me the most, then this one would be at number one!   4)  Racists/homophobics :&nbsp;To me,&nbsp;someone who has a&nbsp;phobia is&nbsp;scared of something, and they dont like to admit it. I dont like people saying their views out loud, just keep your mouth shut! And personally, i dont have a problem with either, so it doesnt bother me.   3)  Chaffas  - You gotta hate  chaffas/chavs/kevs  - whatever you wanna call em, their all the same at the end of the day, nickin' cars and tinkin' dat dey is 'ard by speakin' like day 'as got a speech impediment an addin' swear words in dwiv dere uvva words an smokin some crark.....innit man, innit!   (Note: I do realise that this may well in fact be a phobia, as in relation to number 4)     &nbsp;   2)   Murderers, rapists, peedos, nuns, druggys,&nbsp;door to&nbsp;door salespersons, conmen, loonies, vandals, theives &nbsp;- anything like that. I HATE them! Just lock em up or make em work for free, like making things that everyone needs, that way, prices will be lower because the person making them hasnt got to be paid. And we get to make their lives hell when they work for us as servants with shockers on their privates, like they have to others.   1)  Anything that irritates me in the future  - this is just a lazy number one, because i cant think of anything else. So if something irritates me in the future, then it goes here!   Hmm, i cant see how i came up with 6 other irritating things in one day (yes i did it today) but oh well, its out of the way.   Just to sum up the title of this masterpiece, i've actually had a haircut now, for those that give a crap&nbsp;- i dont know why i'm even writing this because i doubt anyone does - even i dont. Anyway, i've just had a normal hair cut. Looking at it now, i wish i had it just&nbsp;a bit longer because its a bit too short and it looks like Dale Wintons hairstyle, lol! Overall, cracking job with some regrets. I'm pleased its cut because i dont like it long because its too hard to manage (listen to me, i sound like a woman), and next time i'm keeping an inch or two on simply because the quiff is too gay, lol.  Have i even done a proper blog today? I dont think i have. Oh well, i wont lose any sleep over it, and i'm sure you wont either, so come back next friday, when i'll try and do a couple of topics to write about. If you'd like me to talk about something, then comment at the bottom of this box or email me -  urlLink grand_master_jebus@hotmail.com.....please !    So until then,

      Welcome again........god i'm getting tired of saying that, and tired of writing one of these a day, so from now on i'm just going to draft my blogs and post every friday. I think thats more sensible and puts less pressure on the old noggin.  &nbsp; Ok, well i didnt write this yesterday like i usually do before the day i post them, so i'm in a hurry to think of something and then type it out. So Saturday was the last time i write anything so i cant remember what i promised. I can remember saying that i'll do 8 and 7 for my top ten irritating things, but i get the feeling i'm forgetting something.  &nbsp;  So, what other news do i have for you today....nothing.....moving on.........  &nbsp;  Heres the 8th and 7th&nbsp;irritating things:  &nbsp;   8) Planning to sleep in late and getting woke up early:  I hate it when this happens because the college weeks finished and all you want to do is catch up on sleep. So when you get woken up a couple of hours after you get up for college, your bound to be pissed off and tired. If i get notified that i have to get up early, then i'm usually ok and i've got the sunday morning to sleep. But when it happens ON a sunday, theres no chance of another lie in because its back to college the next day.  &nbsp;   7) Childish people:  Theres a difference between having fun and acting childish, and some people need to realise this. I wont go too&nbsp;much into detail on this because i've talked about it in one of my previous blogs but when your 16/17 and you act like your 5, then you need to realise you have to grow up. But like i said, theres a difference between having fun and acting childish. Yeah you might think that throwing chips is fun, but you need you need to think what others think when their watching you.    Anyway, i'm gonna leave it there and work on Fridays blog, so i'll see you then folks!   -Peace-

      Well call me a house&nbsp;of cards and blow me down, i'm back again for a fifth time! So its sunday today so i thought why dont i write about sundays. Also, i was at my Nan and Grandads 50th Wedding Anniversary yesterday, so i thought i'd use that to produce a subject about old folks in general.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now yesterday, i was deciding whether or not to cut shave my head, and i've decided.............not to. You know why? Because i'm now working at Safeway. Yes they got back to me and said that next Saturday i've got an induction day there. Actually, they told me this yesterday, but if i told you then, then i wouldnt of had anything to write about except that immaturity thing. So now i'm happy because i honestly didnt think that i was going to get it. Yay!   A good source of mine just told me that our timetable next year at college is a bit dodgy. Apparently, the lessons are all between 1hr 10 and 1hr 35. Is it just me or do you think their getting off on making lessons longer and making us suffer. Yeah Cadbury, people are really gonna wanna become students their when you make it pants! Hopefully someone will step in and say "Dont you think this is a bad idea". I'm hoping!   &nbsp;So like i said, i was at an anniversary party at my aunts house. I didnt think she knew what she was letting herself in for saying she'd hold it there, because my Grandad invited about 40 people. And they werent young people either, they werent in their 60's/70's/80's. So you wouldnt imagine it to be fun, but i wasnt there to have fun, if i wanted fun i'd go to a stripclub, lol. So anyway, just by looking at them, i thought i'd write a little something dedicated to them.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Now when you look at old people, you think they've been that age all their life, and because we're only young, we havent see what  they  looked like young. Do we even know that they have been young. Yeah we've seen photos of our grandparents in their prime, but anyone could take a photo out of a magazine. Ok, i'm just being stupid here, but ya never know.  &nbsp; Anyway, when your on a bus, theres the odd one or two that come upstairs and you just worry that they are going to fall down the stairs when their coming up or going down and do their hip in.  &nbsp; And can you picture yourself when your their age. It'll be wierd. One day your like "i've still got 30 more years left in me", then BAM you've just snapped your back which just halved your life expectancy. At least we're young, we've got years to go yet. You never know either, they might invent something to prevent death in the elderly. I wouldnt&nbsp;have it though, people die for&nbsp;&nbsp;a reason, and i'd know when my time is up. I wouldnt wanna stay here forever and ever because it would get boring.  &nbsp; So what would you say is an OAP's enemie? Kids, maybe? Or death&nbsp;and accidents? I'm gonna go with chaffas (for definition check out  urlLink www.chavscum.co.uk ). I cant wait till chaffas get old and see what its like to get&nbsp;mugged by the next generation of chaffas. But you gotta love old people though.  &nbsp; Ok, at this point i dont know why i decided to write about old people because i've ran out of ideas and points to make about them. So i think that this is just as good a point as any to end it and get onto the next subject, Sundays!  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Sundays? What the hell! Yes its from one bad subject to another, but i thought i'd share my views on Sundays with the rest of you. I love Sundays, because a lot of people have the day off, and i like it when people have the day off because they get to do the odd jobs around the house and just relax. Now for me, its just the relaxing part because i dont have jobs to do until i start work at Safeway. (New word alert! Chill + Relax = Chillax) So how do i spend my time on a Sunday. Well personally i prefer winter sundays to summer sundays, because its cold outside and you can spend the day inside in the warm, but with summer sundays, its warm outside and you feel that your wasting a day lying in bed, so you gotta get up and do something. But in my case, i still sleep anyway because i've got nout better to do. Now i'd like some feedback at this point telling me how you would usually spend a winters sunday, and i'll carry on with this.....next sunday, obviously - providing the amount of feedback i get. Otherwise i'll write about something else.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; On the same story, i'm considering cutting the amount of times i write on this site because then&nbsp;i can put more stuff into one instead of spreading it out throughout the week, and i'll have more ideas for future entrys. But i'm not gonna do this till after this week because no doubt i'll have nothing to do.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Ok, so i'm getting onto the next topic now, and that is the top ten things that irritate me the most, because i had so much fun doing the immaturity ranking that i thought i'd do it about something else. Today will be the first 2, and throughout the rest of the week another 2 will be announced. Notice i'm just putting things back today. So here we go with number 10:  &nbsp;   10) Not having anything to eat in the house:  Now this just really gets my back up (Note: I've never used that phrase before). When&nbsp; i'm hungry and i want something to eat, and i get into the kitchen and theres absolutely nothing to eat, i get angry! All there is is........cheese.....and bread.......and salad. Yeah i know what your thinking, why dont i have a cheese and salad sandwich or something...but i cant have that everytime i'm hungry. Also, i like to cook, and when theres nothing that i can cook with i get pissed off easily!  &nbsp;   9) Being bored : I hate being bored simply because theres nothing to do. I seriously gotta find something to do with my life so i dont get bored ever again. Theres nothing worse than watching the hours go past. Usually on weekends i get up late, and then in the holidays i say to myself that i should get up early because its a waste of a day, but then what is the point of me getting up if theres nothing to do! &nbsp; Come back tommorow for 8 and 7. &nbsp;   -Peace-

      &nbsp; Well arent you suprised! I'm back again for a fourth time now and i'm actually getting a little scared at how committed i am so far. Actually, i have to be honest with you, i write these a day in advance, so i write this one yesterday, and i write tommorows today, if that makes sense. So if i do anything in a different tense or wrote something that you know if wrong, let me know straight away!  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway, today (or yesterday) i'll be deciding who is the most immaturist person i know. Plus, i'll be deciding whether i should shave my head!  &nbsp;  But first, other news:  &nbsp;  &nbsp; People know that i love the simpsons, its the greatest cartoon on earth ever! Now, currently, officially, the creators, publishers, whatever you wanna call em, are on Season 4. Personally, i think that it doesnt get good till season 4, maybe theres a couple in the seasons before, but their not the funniest untill season 5. Apparently, Season 5 isnt coming out untill august, so i heard anyway. So the other week, i brought Seasons 14 and 15 on DVD off eBay. I was pleased with this purchase because Season 15 had about 12 episodes i hadnt seen before because on Sky one their still going through it, and their on about the 15th one i think. Anyway, i was on eBay again, and i saw Seasons 10 and 11 on DVD!!! I couldnt believe my eyes! I've got to buy them, but then if i do its another thing on my list of things to buy. So i gotta add it to my list of my provisional, money for the hols, money for my new phone, and money for Spiderman 2 game. So, since Simpsons is so important to me, i thought i might aswell buy it. I'll send off for my provisional when i get a job because its no use having it when i cant afford lessons, and i have a feeling my moms gonna buy my the game, plus my new phones on loan from my dad, so i'll still have it but i'll be in debt to him. Moving on...  &nbsp;  I still havent heard anything from safeway, hopefully i will before sunday...i'll get into that after the ranking though:  &nbsp;  Ok, so here we go. The people involved in this are me (Craig), Martin, Jason, Andrew, Joe, Sam, Ross, Mike and Mark. I'm basing this upon how i know them, plus what other people have said:     Sam - i've heard a lot of people say that they think that Sam is the most childish person out of us lot, and i must say that they are right. I've told him on several occasions, but does he do anything about it? No! He says he needs a girlfriend, but who would want to go out with someone that is 17 coming on 5? Reasons: Punching people when he see's a yellow car, punching random things, throwing food, taking bags, hitting things out of peoples hands, acting like an infant! Also, his stupidity comes into play a bit aswell, as he thought i was making a film about door handles in film studies!  Ross - You wouldnt expect it from Ross of all people, but yes he is slightly less childish than Sam. So Ross, if you read this, now you know where you are ranked, i'd change, before we&nbsp;start getting you confused with Sam, and thats a bad thing. Reasons: Taking bags even though he doesnt like it, throwing food, punching people for no reason, being silly.  Joe - Same as Sam and Ross really, just toned down a bit. Joins in with Sams punching games.  Mike - For a christian, he is pretty silly. When we first met him, he was calm, but since hanging around with us, his hyperactiveness has gone through the roof, just look at makin jasons nose bleed.  Andrew/Mark - Yes its joint here, because i cant decide who is more immature. I wouldnt say that they are that immature, but this is where i would rank them  Martin/Jason/Craig - Yep and its joint here aswell. Simply because we can act our age and not throw food even when tempted to. Martins grown up a lot at college, and Jasons always been mature. And yes i have had my moments, but i dont throw friggin' chips around after snooker or take peoples shoes off and throw them around.   &nbsp; So there you have it, the official ranking of immaturity. Maybe i could of/should of done a vote or a border line thing as in Sam, Ross, Joe, Andrew Mark/Jason, Martin, Me. And Mark, Joe, Ross, Sam, Andrew - if you want to argue with me that your in the wrong place, then do so, because i can argue back and i will win because i know how childish you are, with the chances of me winning going down in order of ranking.  &nbsp; Was it just me, or was this past week a bad week to end on? I'd of rather done full days of lessons than first aid, simply because i didnt enjoy first aid enough, plus the breaks were short and took the piss big time! Even Sams said that he didnt want to end this week. Awww i miss college already. I'm hoping that i'll still be in&nbsp;next year. I've got to make the most out of next year because its our last year, and i dont wanna stay another year because my brother will probably be coming there and i dont wanna be in the same house as him, let alone the same college! Next thing you know he'll be working with me! But he is going to join the army so i'm pleased about that.  &nbsp; I know this was a long time ago, but i dont think that Eastenders should of won the best soap award - its too depressing! Corrie should of won it definetly because that is the greatest soap on earth, and you gotta love Kirk! Also, what the hell was that all about with Jessie Wallace winning the sexiest actress! She looks like a pig thats been tested in the labs. There are a lot of females in soaps that deserved to win that! Oh, and Eastenders just pissed me off at them awards...why did Sonia win the best youngster? Shes about 20 aint she? I'll tell you who should of won it, Chesney from Corrie...he's so funny even if he is ginger.  &nbsp; Recently i've been watching Hollyoaks for some reason. I didnt even like it when i watched it, yet i still watched it the next day. This was the late night ones by the way, and i probably just kept the channel on after Big Brother.  &nbsp; By the way, Dan to win BB5! And if you think that wanting a gay man to win makes me gay, then you can go screw and start fantasising about something else...dirty buggas! Oh and for the record, didnt Brian win the second one? I doubt that it was just women and other gays that voted for him, i bet there was straight men to!  &nbsp; Anyway, i think i've made a big enough gap between the 2 main subjects, so lets get on with it shall we!  &nbsp; Ok, so heres the situation. I am thinking of cutting my hair......short! I'm not talking just a light trim, but right down the the skin till its about a millimeter of hair. And i'm planning on doing this on sunday. Why though? Well you probably all know that i have curly hair, and when it gets long, theres nothing i can do with it. Plus i wanna get rid of my quiff, lol. I've had it since year 10 and i fancy a change to see how well it suits me. So why am i debating about this? Well i dont know whether to or not. If i cut it short, then theres nothing i can do about it but wait till it grows back, and it might loo stupid. But if i risked it, then it might look alright and i wouldnt have a problem and i've found myself a new style for next year. And i dont know if you've seen it but theres this blonde bit at the front which is bugging me and its right down to the skin so i cant cut my hair just a little bit to get rid of it, its all gonna have to come off! If i keep it long, then its gonna look stupid, and i'm going on holiday in august so it would leave white bits around the sides if i cut it a bit.  &nbsp; Earlier i was talking about safeway. If they get back to me before sunday saying i havent got it, then i'll do it, but if i have got it then i wont, so hopefully they'll get back to me before then so i can make up my mind.  &nbsp; Now i know this wasnt the best subject to write about, but hey, i'm doing this thing daily, so i need subjects to write about!  Until then though,  this has been Craig signing off....  ...back to the studio....   -Peace-

       Wow its suprised me now that i'm back writing another column. I'm guessing that some time i'll be reducing the amount of time i write in this due to work (if i am) and other things like if i go out, which is likely.&nbsp; &nbsp; You wouldn't believe how glad i am that first aids over. I had a bit of a lie in today without worrying or caring about going in. Its started to kick in now at how pissed off i am that i havent passed it, and i am a little disappointed that i havent, but it cant be helped.   &nbsp; Anyway, moving on...   &nbsp; I've decided that i might have a small party this year for my birthday, and have an even bigger one next year for my 18th. Yes you guessed it i'm not 17 at the moment, but i will be in August. At times like this i wish i was a couple of months older, but then what would i blame my stupidity on? Anyway, i'd keep in my good books if you wanna come, and maybe you could grow up a bit if you act like you just came home from nursery. I'm gonna try and make this a great night for all.   &nbsp; I'm trying to come up with things i can do during the holidays. So far i've came up with.....nothing! But theres a couple of days left till the hols start officially.   &nbsp; Actually i could start making my cartoon if i get a programme to do it with. That would more or less take up most of the holiday because i can work fully on it and put in more detail. Also one day i'm gonna need voices for the characters so if you think you might be suitable to do a voice for either a great dane/rottweiler type dog called Rocky, or a green cat with a diamond in its stomach called Bullet then let me know that your interested. The reason for this is i'm gonna try and enter it into this film festival next year and hopefully i could win - its something that could get the cartoon further, plus i think its for £5000 or £2000 - i dunno though. Then theres the college one...whadda ya win? Nout!  More news on this as it develops.   &nbsp; So like i said, i'm goin to talk about the year just gone...   &nbsp; What is there to talk about to start off with? Well theres been the ups, theres been the downs, and theres been the inbetweenie bits. Personally i liked the ups really.  Firstly, theres the time we brought Mike into our group. What a jolly time that was. At that time i didnt really know him, but he stuck to us like aids to a gay man. And over the time, i've been the one to sit by him, i took him under our wing at first, and now he's one of us he's gotten too big for his boots!  &nbsp; Then, theres the times that people get a wee bit too silly and start to throw food. Ok, thats died down a bit now, so i'm pleased with that, but it does start to creep in with Sam, Joe and Ross. I'm hoping that maybe that'll be out of their system for next year.  We also had our fun laughing at the people that walk past. Theres the regulars - afro man, the gangster woman, various teachers, and the girls sam likes. Didnt really work the last couple of weeks because everyone just seems to of disappeared!  &nbsp; Ok, now this is the point where i'm running outta ideas, so i'm just gonna go to my top ten rememberable things of the year, in no particular order:    1)  Joe and Mark trying on Mels coat  &nbsp; - So funny that it actually fit Joe and Mark just looked gay!  2)  The banana throwing &nbsp; - What a mess!&nbsp;I know it was silly but still fun!  3)  Mark and Andrew wrapping scarves and bandages round their heads  4)  Mark and Jason falling over when Mark took him down   5)  Jason screaming loudly   6)  Big Wok - Rocky birthday announcement - Andrew and Nikki wedding announcement &nbsp; - This is one of the most memorable things that happened when we was out of college. (Note: Rocky was a biker looking man and the announcement said '...and happy birthday to Rocky, whos showing off his new beard!')  7)  Ross getting beaten on Martins phone &nbsp; - You'd have to see it first, but was quite funny when the 2 Tom's kept hitting Ross, one which went right in the face!  8)  Joe drinking the mix of rock, milkshake and coke  &nbsp; - Rock, as in the sweet variety, strawberry milkshake and coke dont go well together, just ask Joe. He really did look sick!  9) &nbsp;Martin under the table &nbsp; - I think this was the first and last time this happened because he got a good kicking from everyone when he was under there, plus he couldnt get out, plus a teacher saw him.  10)  Mike hitting Jasons nose &nbsp; - Some might say that it was my fault for touching mikes tit, but he shouldnt of punched out at me, especially when Jason was in the middle, and he knew it was him because he went to the toilet with Jason. Anyway, if it was me then i've already apologised to Jason.  And then my top five irritable things:    1)  Sam and Joe punching things  &nbsp; - Was there really any need or any point? What is it about punching table legs, bars on the bus, other peoples knees that they get of on so much?  2)  Sam hitting people when he sees a yellow car  &nbsp; - Again, whats the point in this? Every single time he sees a yellow car, he hits people. I've told him before that he can hit me if i allow him to hit me, and i havent yet he still does. He needs to stop this before someone hits him back........hard!  3)  People spilling coke/throwing food/blowing things off the table &nbsp; - Ok,&nbsp;i know the spilling of coke has stopped, which i'm glad of, but people still threw food. If they wanted to do this then they can go home and do it there, but not in a public place e.g. college or restaurants.   4)  Immaturity &nbsp; - A number of people have told me this is Sam that they have seen doing it, and i have to agree. Sam must be without doubt the biggest baby i've met!  5)  People taking other peoples things, e.g. bags, coats etc. &nbsp; - What the fasination is i dont know.  &nbsp; Tommorow i'll be ranking the immaturity of people, starting with Sam. Find out the rest tommorow. Also, i'll be weighing the pro's and con's of cutting my hair...short!  If you want to add anything to anything i've said, then you can comment on each blogging at the bottom somewhere...  Thanks a lot people, come back tommorow,  &nbsp;- Peace -

        Guess who's back! As promised here i am again with a column about First Aid Week, but as you can see i've chosen to call it anger management week. Why? Simply because i didnt like it, and i've learnt some things about myself.   First of all, i'll start with the teacher i had. Her name is Nicola and she was there to make my life hell for the past week. Everything i've done is wrong. Yeah i'll admit it now, i might of deserved SOME of the tellings off, but she just cant take a joke.   I think it all started on the first day. We went around the group telling each other about ourselves. When it got to me, i said "My names Craig, i got 2 brothers. Thats it". So then Nicola asks me "Are you glad to be here?" I said "I'm tolerating it". I think this set her off because ever since shes been out to get me. Then, out came the dummys...Annie i think their called. I take it you all know the proceedure by now, so when i was supposed to wake her up, i started picking her up and moving her. Not the best thing to do when your trying to make a good first impression. But i know for a fact that i wouldnt do that if that situation ever came up. Just like all the other stuff i've been told off for!   In my class with me, its Andrew and Hannah, with the others, plus yours truly. So as you can see the first thing thats pissed me off is the fact that me and my mates arent together. If Andrew werent there i wouldnt of came because there wouldnt be any point really. If i needed a certificate to show people what i've learnt then fine, but i dont. If someones having i heart attack i bet you that they couldnt care less about my friggin' certificate, they just want help and quick! Plus i've got my book to help me if i need it, but i doubt that the chances of my being on my own when theres no one else  around and someone collapses is low.   So, this week i worked with Hannah for doing a sling, and i'd finished my sling on her and waiting for Nicola to come and have a look at it, so while i was waiting with Hannah (who wouldnt shut up) i decided to tie a bandage round her mouth. It did the job and she saw the funny side, as did everyone else that saw it, which was most of the class. Then when 'her majesty' turned around and saw it, she just went off on one. And anyway, i dont think i wouldnt bandage someones mouth up if that ever happened!   I thought First Aiders were friendly. Hmm, maybe i'm thinking of someone else. Anyway, she threw me out the room and told me to be more serious, but if it wasnt for my joking around, i wouldnt be there. So she could of either accepted the fact that i have a sense of humour and i like a laugh, or she can come and kiss my ass!   So anyway, i came back in the room, and  when i done the sling again, i tightened the knot and Hannah sort of had a back spasm and she couldnt move till she took some painkillers. Then, we were all sitting back in the circle again, and someone made a joke...and she laughed...i thought we were meant to be serious and here she is laughing...tut tut Nicola! Thats what i hate in people, they tell people not to do something then eventually they do it themselves. They've got to understand this and learn their lesson.   People know me and know i like a joke. I like to laugh, yeah. In fact i laugh at a lot of things, i cant help that, thats me. But when certain people tell me i cant have a laugh to enjoy myself, then that gets me worked up. I havent felt this pissed off since...well i cant remember the last time i was this stressed out at something... i hate being stressed, its not me. This woman has changed me, and not in a good way. She should go back to London, or wherever the hell it is she comes from! I'm glad that i'll never have to see her ever again...unless of course she turns out to be a relative of mine or something bizarre like that (hmm wierd, i never use the word bizarre!).   So, i've failed my first aid anyway, but like i've said i dont need a badge to show people what i've learnt. I couldnt care less, and thats why i havent wrote that much about it. And if they think i'm doing it again in September then they can think again.   Anyway, my test is out of the way and i'll never have to do first aid again...yeah i know what your thinking, but until that happens i'm free!    I've seen Shrek 2 and i can tell you now that it is worth going to watch if you havent already. Its a great film and i've seen it twice already. I've also seen Spiderman 2 and that is great aswell. Their both really good films for sequels and i gaurantee you'll enjoy them.     Speaking of Spiderman 2, i'm planning on getting the game soon, which looks really good in the ads i've seen. I just gotta get some money first, plus money for my new phone, and provisional.    Anyway, i've applied at safeway, which i've already had an interview for. I'm just waiting now for a reply to see if i've got it. Hopefully i have cuz i've got maccys on my back waiting for me to arrange an interview. No affence to maccys or anything but i'd rather work in safeway. Oh and theres the fact that wayne works at maccys.....thats a different matter though.    So there you go, the second column for my new site (i'm calling it my blog - which it is) and Saturday i dont know if i'll be writing anything because i'm out at my Nan and Grandads 50th Wedding anniversary. And tommorow i'll be looking back at the year at college.    Thank you everyone,          Peace!

      Hi everyone, i gather you found my new site alright. The reason? Well i just didnt like the way that freewebs.com was set up, so i thought that i'd find a new place to write my thoughts, views, and opinions. Yes i know that i've kind of stopped recently, but thats because i've got writers block, and the things that happened with Joe and Mark.    But anyway, this is my new website, and i think that it will be easier to use without it driving me up the wall with anger!   The summer hols are coming up soon, so i'm guessing so far that i wont be having that much inspiration to write from. But hopefully some good things will happen over the hols and i can write a full length column.  Tommorow (maybe) i'll be writing about First Aid week, or as i'm going to call it, Anger management week. I'll explain why tommorowm hopefully, because i'm going to dedicate my life to this column, providing people read it!   Mail me at :  grand_master_jebus@hotmail.com

      Well i think its time for another post ladies and gentlemen, but what the hell can i write about today? I've just this minute decided to write another post, so not that much planning has gone into it.  Lets just get into the Random thoughts:  Yep, i've decided to call it random thoughts - ya know, the bit where i just have little discussions about things........anywho......  This could well be the last time i write anything for a week or so because i'm off on my 'holidays' next week to the lake district, so i cant really do anything about that, unless i find a way to post it automatically everyday. Also, i cant post anything tommorow because i'm working 1 -10. So i'm gonna try and make the most out of it today.  On the money front, i'm getting quite wealthy, lol. I was thinking about buying a computer for myself, but then i thought, why the hell do i need one when i already have one, and it wont be that long before my dad gives in and buys a new one anyway, because this ones on life support. Anyway, i shouldnt really get used to the rich and famous life...well rich life anyway, cuz most of the money i've made will be gone after i spend it paying for the Bournemouth trip me and the ladz are going on. Should be good fun anyway, providing it doesnt rain...and that we get in in the first place. Anyway, besides that, i hope to have a good time and i hope everyone else does. I did have something to say that i hope to do there, but its completely gone out of my head. Couldnt of been that important if i cant remember it. Oh wait, i know now. I was gonna say i hope to make a lot of video footage, along with Martin aswell, and then hopefully put it altogether into one film with music and put it on DVD, which depending on what happens in Bournemouth, should be a great little film. I'm just trying to think of what music to put in the background....and i wont be taking any suggestions from Ross and Sam. I think that a Beatles song could fit in well with it. But, we'll see what happens on the footage and whether i think of anything else. And Martin may have to load the footage onto his computer anyway cuz i dont have a computer lead for my phone, so hopefully, his will work on mine. I doubt it though, as their different phones. Maybe Ross might.   Anyway, got no major topic to discuss today, so i'll leave it there, and have a new column here.

      Yep, thats right, i'm thinking of changing my tune on this. I feel that after several times of recieving hate mail, that i'd turn over a new leaf and be kind on this. I am in real life, but when i get on this computer, i become possessed.  So startin from today, i'll be the new Craig.  Anyway, i was gonna say this even if i was the evil Craig, but i reccomend visiting one of my good friend Martins website.  urlLink  http://groups.msn.com/Frozenhopejukebox   Its a great site, i've just visited it and it is very very kool, so go there now!  With that, i thought i'd steal one of Martins ideas, and write about 'the lads' as the new me.   Martin:  Martin is the greatest friend anyone can have. He is bound to make you laugh one way or another at least once a day. He is entertaining and things arent the same without him around.....he lights up the room, and gets everyone in the right mood. He is good at arranging stuff like going out, and it turns out to be a great night. If you ever need advice, he's the one to go to, or if you say something, he'll have his opinion and make you think twice about it and makes you wonder if its the right thing to do. I've known him since almost the beginning of Colmers, and made school a good reason to go for. I hope to know Martin forever because he is one of my best friends i've ever had. Thank you Martin.   Mark:  Although me and Mark dont seem the best of friends, i can always call him one. He's certainly came out of his shell since we left Colmers, but we did ask for him to change so we can complain. Marks another one i've known since the start of Colmers, and i've known him ever since that, and hopefully a long time after this. You may say his gay, but i say his just friendly.   Ross:  I think the first time we met was in year 7, and over the years our friendship have grown and i wouldnt change that for anything. Ross is a great friend, and he is always there to help, whether it be on money, computers, or college work. I wonder what would of happened if he didnt move to live closer to me. Would we still know him? He likes to arrange nights out, although it can result in being repetitive. At least he trys, and thats what counts because its keeping the group together. Sometimes he gets a bit too big for his boots, but soon realises that and calms down.   Sam:  I've only really gotten closer to Sam since the end of year 11. He hung around but we didnt talk that much until we started walking to and from school. From there, we've communicated through the sound of animals, and since then found out we do actually speak english, so theres no need for the animal talk anymore. His expressions are one of a kind, and i prefer the Sam that sits still and behaves.   Andrew : Great guy, cant find any problems with him. His voices can make you laugh, and what he says. He's one of them people you HAVE to have around, and he usually is. I've known him since year 7, and its not until when we broke up from school since we've started to hang around more. People call him fat, but he only has one chin, and doesnt exactly have a spare tyre round his waist, unlike some people i know.   Jason:  One of the funniest people you meet. Whatever you say will definetly make you laugh. The first time i saw him was in DT in year 7. He didnt really look the funny type, but over the time i got to know him better and i'm glad that we have. When the holidays roll round, you'd think he was dead. When he does make an appearance, its worth him being there. Dont ever change Jas.   Joe:  What can i say about Joe? I'll have to admit, he's not one of the people i'm closest to, but like Ross, i can call him a friend. We dont seem to have a lot in common, but you can count on Joe to have fun. His laugh is great because it brings a smile to my face, and can get involved with things. Him and Sam are a lethal combination, but boys will be boys.  I would go onto  Mike , but i'm not going to. I dont count him as one of the group, just a college mate - someone you see in college and never again until you go back. I cant see him staying with us, and i dont know what will become of him when we leave college next year.  So there you have it, the first day of my being  NICE!  (Almost, anyway)   Until the next time our paths cross,

      Hi all, just a quick discussion today:  Now my site might not be that popular, and the only reason it has the amount of popularity that it does is because i talk about people. An example of this is Ross. The other day, we were chatting and suddenly he says "Why the f**k am i top of the immaturity table?" And i said to him because Sam actually behaved therefore he moves up, and as Ross was second, he then became first. Apparently though, Sam did throw a menu, but i didnt see it, and its me writing this thing, not Ross.  I'd just like to point out to people that there is a comment feature underneath each blog, so feel free to use it.....Ross! I think these things come in useful at times like this, so its not just between me and whoever has a problem with what i write.  Also, i dont do these things to be hated. Why would i write things like this about my mates? I'm not actually being that serious, and i dont want to come across all poncy to others. The immaturity table is just a joke, just a way to show who i think is the most immature.  So from now on, i'd appreciate it if people left feedback, their views, underneath each blog, so myself and others can see....even if its just a quick hello!  Well, thats all i have to say, had to write it down!   Thanks for reading,

      Well another series of Big Brother has passed us by yet again, and we see another winner. Yes its Nadia, ( CJC Note : or No-Nads as i call her). Why did she win? I have no idea, and i didnt realise the country was into transexuals until now. But she gave us laughs, thats the main thing......isnt it? Today i'll be looking at the contestants, and my favourite and worst bits of the show.  Firstly, I'd like to express my outrage ( CJC Note : Again?) that Dan - or Gandalf the Gay - didnt win. Yes, i've heard the comments that if someone wants a gay man to win then they are gay themselves, but i dont find that true. ( CJC Note : I find that people that cover up their own sexuality by calling other people gay, are actually hiding something themsleves).  Anyway, as promised, heres my summary of the characters, in what i can remember to be the order of eviction:   Kitten:  Who? Oh yeah that shakey one. I didnt like her before she even entered the house. She was dressed like a typical lesbian and was uuuglay! ( CJC Note : Whatever happened to the good looking lesbians that we see in films?) I'm so glad she was evicted first. Yay!   Emma:  She wasnt actually evicted properly, so she could of won it. But then she might of been favourite therefore pushing Dan down another place, or even evicted before the final 4. Oh well. ( CJC Note : As i like to think, everything happens for a reason!)   Vanessa:  They claimed she was the best looking contestant to grace the screens of BB, but i disagree ( CJC Note:  I liked that Tania and Anouska better) but obviously that wasnt enough to keep her in. I think she should of been a bit more fun and kinky. What i find is that the public want the women to be like this, and when they do, they vote em out!)   Marco:  What a bloody mincing queer he was. He annoyed me straight away with his....mincing! But i thought he was a bit funny, and that helped him stay in.   Becki:  Perfect example of someone that acted kinky and got voted out. She started to get on my nerves a bit, and i presume everybody elses aswell. And them teeth! God!   Ahmed:  I thought he might of stayed in longer...as much as i didnt want him too. He didnt have fun, and when you dont have fun, you get evicted. ( CJC Note : Except Jason, for some reason!)   Victor : He seemed to of had 2 personalitys. I prefered the softer side because he joined in more, and didnt wreck weddings or start fights, which eventually led to his eviction.   Michelle : At first, i liked her because everyone like Shell and Vanessa were picking on her. Then when everyone else liked her (CJC Note: Wasnt that when Vanessa left and Shell was on her own therefore having to make new friends?) she became "The Bunny Boiler". That really got on my nerves, especially when she said "Do you remember when you used to make bread with me?" like a mong. She got what was coming to her (CJC Note: No not when Stuart was voted out. And no not when they done it under the table. I meant eviction!)   Stuart : I kinda liked Stuart, except when he kept slowing his words down and saying erm in everything, which kinda bored me to death. He was funny in his costumes with his surfer phrases, but that was it. And i found that when Michelle left, he came out of is shell a bit,   Shell : I thought she was quite good looking, and has a great body. Her voice done my head in though, because it was too posh and squeaky. Plus she cried at every given opportunity.   Dan : As i said before, i "loved" Dan. He was funny, and he took the piss outta Nadia, what more could you want. I'm a wee bit pissed of that he didnt win though.   Jason:  I thought he would of gone much earlier than this, because all he did was moan, sleep, pose in the mirror and most of all, was scottish.   Nadia : The Egg on legs won, and now she feels accepted. How long before no one knows her anymore. Only time will tell.  My favourite part of the series was between the bedsit thing and maybe " Fight Night ". ( CJC Note : Hang on, werent they the same thing?) or maybe the night with the jam.  My worst part of the series was when nothing good happened. Or maybe the way Stuart was evicted - so sad. No wait, it might of been when Dan didnt win!  So, this is the last time i'll be writing anything about Big Brother. What will i do from now on at 10? What will there be in the papers to read? One way to find out.......   Come back next time for something not Big Brother Related,

        Heres a quick story i just found and it made me laugh:    A guy is browsing in a pet shop and sees a parrot sitting on a little Perch. It doesn't have any feet or legs. The guy says aloud, "Jeesh, I wonder what happened to this Parrot?"  The parrot says, "I was born this way. I'm a defective parrot." "Holy crap," the guy replies. "You actually understood and answered me!" "I got every word," says the parrot. "I happen to be a highly intelligent, thoroughly educated bird." "Oh yeah?" the guy asks, "Then answer this -- how do you hang onto your perch without any feet?" "Well," the parrot says, "this is very embarrassing but since you asked, I wrap my weenie around this wooden bar like a little hook. You can't see it because of my feathers." "Wow," says the guy. "You really can understand and speak English can't you?" "Actually, I speak both Spanish and English, and I can converse with reasonable competence on almost any topic: politics, religion, sports, physics, philosophy. I'm especially good at ornithology. You really ought to buy me. I'd be a great companion."  The guy looks at the $200 price tag. "Sorry, but I just can't afford that." "Pssssssst," says the parrot, "I'm defective, so the truth is nobody wants me. You can probably get me for $20,just make the guy an offer!"  The guy offers $20 and walks out with the parrot.  W eeks go by. The parrot is sensational. He has a great sense of humor, he's interesting, he's a great pal, he understands everything, he sympathizes, and he's insightful. The guy is delighted.  One day the guy comes home from work and the parrot goes, "psssssssssssst," and motions him over with one wing. I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but it's about your wife and the postman." "What are you talking about?" asks the guy. "When the postman delivered the mail today, your wife greeted him at the door in a sheer black nightie and kissed him passionately." "WHAT???" the guy asks incredulously. "THEN what happened?" "Well, then the postman came into the house and lifted up her nightie and began petting her all over," reported the parrot. "Oh No!," he exclaims. "Then what?" "Then he lifted up the nightie, got down on his knee and began to kiss her all over, starting with her breasts and slowly going down...." "WELL," demands the frantic guy, "THEN WHAT HAPPENED?" "Damned if I know. I got a hard-on and fell off my perch! "

      I was just writing in my profile.......nothing much to hurry there now if you was going to do so, because its just about me, and everyone knows me! Anyway, when i was on the confirmation page, it said a couple of things:  1) I was born in the year of the rabbit apparently 2) 4 people have looked at my profile  ok, the first one doesnt really have any importance, but i was shocked that that many people have viewed my profile! Shocked! I didnt really expect anyone to look at it. I wouldnt be suprised if there was less than that who viewed the main page.  Anyway, since i'm already on here, i thought i'd discuss a couple of things:  - I watched I, Robot the other day, and i must say that i thought i would enjoy it a little more. Dont get me wrong, i did like it and all, but i expected more...i dont know what, but oh well. For those that dont know what its about, then i'm going to say now. Dont worry its not a spoiler. Will Smith plays Del Spooner who doesnt trust robots, and finds it hard since he lives in a world with them. Then, the robots become bad to the.....bolts! And you can pretty much guess the rest. I'd give it 6/10, but i think other people would enjoy it more. I prefer comedy to action anyway.  2. I watched that Peter Kay live last night and although it was the 2nd time i'd seen it (thanks to martin for lending it me 1st time) it was still funny and i was in bits, my sides were splitting, i was wetting myself, i was rolling on the floor laughing, i was laughing out loud, i was...... ok i'm exagerating there, but i enjoyed it again, and one day i'm going to buy it for myself on DVD. I think i'll mark this aswell, and give it 10/10!  3. Big Brother final Friday, and i still want Dan to win. He takes the piss out of Nadia and his funny, what more could you want from a BB contestant? Oh wait, people want transexuals to win these days. I'll tell you what, it really pisses me off when Nadia runs out of fags, because it happens about once a week and it bores me! I agree that she has been shown in a good light, but what would she of done to be shown in a bad light. I'd of loved it if she brought her "off cuttings" into the house with her! Last night i was shocked, SHOCKED! that stuart went. And i thought it was sad how he went.  Awwww poor Chicken Stu!  Anyway, i might aswell do a full Big Brother 5 Review sometime over the next week, and i probably will throw in what i think of everyone in it.   Until then,

      Just to get the record straight, i've decided, after a comment from one of my good friends, that i will still be doing blogs on this site.  Martin said to me that he enjoyed reading them, and its things like that that give me ideas of what to write. So thanks to Martin for that. And after other feedback, and people acting differently when we went out Sunday night, i've decided to do a small change to the immaturity table. Infact, i might do it every week depending on what happens.  So here is the table after Sunday night:   1) Ross!   2) Joe   3)Sam  yes these three have swopped around because Sam started to behave...it actually impressed me! And he was even more maturer than Joe. Joe wasnt there so its a bit unfair on him, but based on how i think he would behave, i'm gonna have to go with this.  4)   Andrew/Mark/Martin/Jason/Craig  I'm gonna have to add the rest of us into one category because i must say, on Sunday, we all seemed more grown up. And before you even think about it, i know Jason wasnt there, but like i said i want to put everyone in one category. And....AND.....theres even talk about us going to Bournemouth, so theres some points to be scored in that week. By the way, if anyone disagrees where i am in the table, then tell me and i'll consider changing my ranking. Oh and you might of seen that Mike isnt in the table. Simply because i doubt we'll be seeing him untill we're back at college.  Anyway, moving on, i thought i'd let you know about how my work is going...if you want to leave now because you have no interest then go ahead because i'm not gonna be writing anything else. I'm gonna make this as quick, short, painless and informative as possible..... Works good, goes quite quick, i'm trying to work as much as possible to earn more money, everyones kool there.......and i like working there, and i stack shelves, lol. Thats it.   So i'll try and return another day this week, if not next week

      Now i take it that after reading the title of this post, most of you can guess that this might be the end of yet another site. At this point, i really cant be bothered to write anything, and i'm also stuck for things to write. And, its the summer....too hot to do anything. Hmmm, scratch that...its never too hot, lol. Maybe i'm just taking this as a break. But then again, i've only done about 7 posts aint i. I would say that i'll post something whenever i can be bothered, but no one will know then and no one will be able to read it. This is getting boring already, so its time to call it a day at this point. Maybe i'll return with ANOTHER site, or just accept that i dont do that many popular websites. My MSN site was quite popular, but once people had signed up, they dint come back again!   I thank you all for coming, if you did,  and i wish you all the best in the future,
