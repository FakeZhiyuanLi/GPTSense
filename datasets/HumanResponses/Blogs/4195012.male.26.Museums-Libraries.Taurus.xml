       urlLink    Visited San d'Oria last night and I was trying to get Drain Quest. Unlucky for me I only have Level 2 fame and the quest requires lvl 3, so now I'm doing chores for the people of San d'Oreo to increase my fame.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is the first time I ever saw a Ballista match, Khamen and I wanted to participate but the level cap was 50. It looks like lots of fun, although when I saw that poor Taru getting beat up, I kinda believe  there is no room for whm's in this event.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    -_- omg I was so tired I fell asleep on our party last night. Alric said they all got killed by a cactuar. Now I find myself in some strange land, they said we were going to level in Quicksand Caves. This reminds me of Africa, that thing almost looks like a giraffe. I feel sorry for my group, I'm such a terrible white mage. I should have told them I was too tired.&nbsp; urlLink

This is so far the only game that can make me stop playing  urlLink Final Fantasy XI , I just sit around, grab the steering and shift into high gear! BTW, they also mentioned that  urlLink Brooke Burke  will be on this game ^_^

       urlLink    Castle Oztroja, I visited this place last night, I saw lots of Yagudo's. I didn't go to the second floor coz I think most of the people there were all above lvl 50. I also saw the remains of a giant beast in Meriphataud Mountains. It stretched across the land, what a mighty beast this bones must have belonged too. I only wish that he died of old age and not against something mightier than he is!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's a very cute Taru we met by the Fumaroles. When? I can't remember. I remember we fought side-by-side against crabs, bees and gobs. We gained exp and leveled our jobs. On that day I also gained a friend, and today he helped me obtain my ranger job. Thanks Bro!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Got the last key we needed from Ghelsba, I had fun doing Lvl 2 Renkei with Flo, we were doing  Frost Bite  >  Brainshaker  =  Fragmentation  and I'd do  Magic Burst: Thunder . Getting those keys I say were real easy. And my theory is that the more SC and MB you do, the more drops you'll get. Just a theory though. &nbsp; urlLink
