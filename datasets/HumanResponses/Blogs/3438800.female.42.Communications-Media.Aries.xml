      Today the hall is full of sweets and crisps and packets of sliced bread.  The Youth are going camping to Carroty Wood and that, I suppose, is their tuck.  I wish my boys went to St Mary's Youth outings, it looks like it's going to be such a laugh, and on Sunday they're going to the Seaside.  I hope they go even if the weather is dire, the Sea is an amazing place for considering huge philosophical questions and sunny days put you off thinking about questions any deeper than where the next double 99 is coming from. I have been on my hands and knees painting lists onto flip-chart paper for Anthony's presentation on Sunday, and taping sermons onto copy tapes, because the machine is repaired, and the order for new tapes was delivered, and I'm up and running again.  I was interupted by a lady who is getting married in August and has only just got started organising it, I am off to deliver the Wedding pack to her, as she only lives down the road.  Daft thing to write really, everybody round here lives just down the road.  Liz came in and I told her Anthony wants a letter from the Parish Council Chairman to go in our New Horsley Person Welcome pack.  She is telling him the good news. This week the PC ink ran out, and I didn't have a spare as I thought, so the Bulletin will have to be printed on my home PC and brought back here to photocopy.  My own fault. Mea culpa. XL (Lucy by the Cross) PS I told Guy and Joel (both aged 12) that it didn't matter how bad they were, Jesus died for them whatever they did, and their eyes opened as wide as saucers and I could tell they were thinking it was no holds barred then.  I didn't get that right somehow, I shall have to find a sermon tape on the subject and work out how to explain it better.  One of their friends at school put down that he wanted to be a hired assassin when he grew up.  Thank God there is not a lot of call for that round here, so he'll have to be a solicitor like everybody else.

      Today I found this...  I am so glad we've got Anthony.   But alasse, all these notwithstanding, it is lamentable to see the wicked boldnesse of those that will bee counted GODS people, who passe nothing at all of keeping and halowing the Sunday. And these people are of two sorts. The one sort if they haue any businesse to doe, though there bee no extreme neede, they must not spare for the Sunday, they must ride and iourney on the Sunday, they must driue and carry on the Sunday, they must rowe and ferry on the Sunday, they must buy and sell on the Sunday, they must keepe markets and fayres on the Sunday: finally, they vse all dayes alike, workedayes and holydayes all are one. The other sort is worse. For although they will not trauell nor labour on the Sunday as they doe on the weeke day, yet they will not rest in holinesse, as GOD commandeth: but they rest in vngodlinesse and filthinesse, prancing in their pride, pranking and pricking, pointing and painting themselues to bee gorgious and gay: they rest in excesse and superfluitie, in gluttony and drunkennesse, like rattes and swine: they rest in brawling and rayling, in quarrelling and fighting: they rest in wantonnesse, in toyish talking, in filthie fleshlinesse, so that it it doeth too euidently appeare that God is more dishonoured, and the deuill better serued on the Sunday, then vpon all the dayes in the weeke besides. And I assure you, the beasts which are commanded to rest on the Sunday, honour GOD better then this kinde of people: For they offend not GOD, they breake not their holy dayes. Wherefore, O yee people of GOD, lay your hands vpon your hearts, repent and amend this grieuous and dangerous wickednesse, stand in awe of the Commandement of GOD, gladly follow the example of GOD himselfe, be not disobedient to the godly order of Christs Church, vsed and kept from the Apostles time, vntill this day. Feare the displeasure and iust plagues of Almightie GOD, if ye be negligent and forbeare not labouring and trauailing on the Sabbath day or Sunday, and doe not resort together to celebrate and magnifie GODS blessed Name, in quiet holinesse and godly reuerence.   Pondering these things in my heart Thank you God for today, may I be yours through it, Love Lucy

      On Monday Morning the staff meeting was at Anthony's as usual and I have decided to try putting notes about it out on this.  Jill , Warden, Gina, Reader,  Steve , Youth,  me , admin and note-taking, and  Anthony , container and conduit for the Holy Spirit, discuss the services and the rest of the week, identifying reasons to celebrate and areas of concern.  At The 9 o'clock service, Anthony was on fire, and we felt exhausted, I felt like a bowl washed, dried, and sterilised in the dishwasher, burning and needing a quiet moment in a cupboard before being much use to anyone.  I didn't even notice how many were there, and Anthony has decided to bring home the Service book so he can complete it at the Staff meeting.  Other officials at services will have to phone with this information.  The L1FE service had been particularly exciting, a young classical ballet dancer did her dance and had stood on points and thrilled us with the beauty of it.  Faces were lit with happiness and people felt really glad to be there.  As there wasn't enough bread, Wendy went to get some more.  There was lots of deep gentle ministry, powerful stuff.  This week, Gina wasn't here at the meeting, so we were unable to tell her how well crafted her evensong talk was, I found it hard not to clap with delight.  The theme for evensong had been "Why should I care" and the subject was how precious our young people are, and biblically, it is not assured that our own children are necessarily going to put themselves beside Jesus during and at the end of their lives, and we must encourage our youth workers in their ministry to bring all children to know they are loved by God, so they will walk towards him.  The Villages' Picnic was fab, 600 people and children came.  The Duchess' house and garden were opened and 300 went round at 4 minute intervals, like aeroplanes from Heathrow. I missed going round because Clive did instead; he tells me the inside is medieval, and the brick facade is totally external.  It was lovely day, and my hat and sunglasses disguise allowed me to cycle incognito with a full cup of tea on a saucer across the field to Norman as a dare.  It has cheered me up so much about getting on a bike again, I am determined to get around on it more, and after last night's WHIPs AGM I cycled home in the dark, and my lights worked!  Watch out Horsley!  Some people came to church for the first time after coming to the picnic, and enjoyed themselves.  Our Welcome to West Horsley Gift Pack is taking shape, Anthony thinks it should contain a Parish Mag., a voucher from the Garden Centre, Map of the village from an Estate Agent, a letter from Ant with details of the Services, Info on Rubbish Collection and Milk and Post people, a letter from Bob (Council Chairman) and  packet of seeds... now you are planted in our village, we hope you grow to love it like we do.  This pack should be different from the Church Welcome pack, this should include freebie CDs and tapes, and a stamped and addressed Mystery Shop card (see the Ship of fools website).  We might seriously consider putting a sofa in the welcome area.  We need to turn friendliness outward to make St Mary's part of the Kingdom, and something we are pleased to invite people to.  The welcome is the responsibility of the whole family, we shouldn't rely on other people who are wearing badges.  The letters in the Telegraph (I read one in THE WEEK) discussewd how uncomfortable some people are with invasive welcome greeting.  What's wrong with a hand-shake.  Precious Ramotswe (No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency) would require our unused hand to grasp our shaking arm as a sign of courtesy.  You can't please everyone, so "doasyouwouldbedoneby" and be true to yourself, it follows as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.  Regarding the database, the term he used was "database tsar" to design it, train others to use it, and protect it.  We need to determine what we want to track: attendance, giving, skills, application, spiritual steps,baptism, conferences.  Regular back-up, secure data protection and so on.  I have been asked to do a bunch of stuff for a consultative meeting in two weeks, St Mary's 5 yr plan, the Vision Tape, and a copy of last year's PCC AGM.  Ant knows a problem that he might have to address is his protective possessiveness about certain roles and tasks in the job.  He is effectively running two churches, and this might be done more efficiently with formal delegation, which he is notoriously reluctant to do.   I must go now, the dough in my bread maker is risen above the top of the container, and I need to get the keys of the Wheelhouse kitchen from Anthony so I can bake it, and go to Anne's Bring and buy which started 1/2 an hour ago.  The WHIPS magazine contains the following "To err is human, to forgive takes restraint, to forget you forgave is the mark of a saint." They are anticipating problems with a web site name, but I don't see what is wrong with UUHIPS.  They all laughed when I suggested it last night, but Ant's  urlLink L1FE website  gave me the idea.  God bless our endeavours for the Kingdom Love Lucy

      The Magazines are ready, and the invitations to the Magazine Deliverer's Reception are tucked into each little package so they will be sure to get them.  I wonder how many will come. Jim is away in Canada, so I did his job, and know how it will be if it is necessary to "train" up a replacement should he retire. The Reception is on the last Friday in June and is hosted by Anthony and Sheila, so I do hope they can come! Today, Glenn is being sworn in by the Archdeacon of Dorking. (Or the Bishop, I'm not sure). Unfortunately, I don't know when the appointment is, and Graeme's form is not returned yet, and Glenn's form is in Anthony's letter box, whereas both should be with Anthony and the Archdeacon at the Appointment.  Days like this remind me of the Mother of the Julian of Norwich Nunnery, All will be well, all will be well, all manner of the things will be well. Jody who makes the Candles for Baptisms is in Scotland so I am unable to remind her about the Bailey Patrick Donnell Christening at 1pm on Sunday, but I expect she will be at the Helm-Andrews Wedding on Saturday.  I wonder if Anthony needs to see the out of parish banns certificate or if he will take my word for it?  It is stapled to the back of the wedding agenda on my noticeboard if he wants it.  Tomorrow morning I am expecting Les from the WHIPS who is coming to photocopy the Monthly Whispers for distribution.  I enjoy the company, and the news about my fellow thespians, and we share ideas about desk top publishing.  I shall discuss with him Anthony's suggestion to duplicate the Sunday Bulletin in email format, and this Blogging site, perhaps Whispers could do this as well.  The WHIPS AGM is tonight, and clashes with the Horsley Singers rehearsal in the room next door, so I shall try to sneak between them and hope I don't miss anything important.  At the Meridiana last night the WHIPS committee had a meal ( I had bresaola, rocket and parmesan followed by chili tubes) and decided on the Best Supporting Actor prizes, and Jo from the Pub who played Pike in Dad's Army on Stage has got one. I must rememebr to bill the WHIPS for the photocopying before the Treasurer puts in his final account! Tomorrow at 10am is the Edible Bring and buy so I am going to put some ingredients in the Bread machine when I get home.  Actually I wonder if it would be better to bring the whole thing to work and bake it here tomorrow morning before I go.  The Wheelhouse would smell heavenly. Appropriately enough for a Church. Thank you God for a BEAUTIFUL DAY Love Lucy

      The Rector thinks bits of St Mary's would WORK better if the information and dynamism of our Church Family was accurate, up-to-date and accessible. So many people do so much, the good kind people of West Horsley are fulfilling St Mary's goal, bringing people to God and all that this means, one life at a time. Coming to work is like being part of a miracle.  But the miracle would have a better chance if the input was more efficiently organised.  So this morning Anthony asked for a volunteer who would die for the database.  Hmm tricky one.   News   Donut Sunday is on  6th June  at L1FE On  June 13th  I will bring the Minibus to the Traditional Service to take people to KIDstuf if they would like to go, no need to book, I will bring them back afterwards. Fudge will be at the  20th June  Traditional Service, then Russ Hughes is leading the Worship at the L1FE service The services are both going to be at the Church for the summer ( July/August ) We are putting together a welcome pack with small gifts and information for new people moving into the village.  If you know you have a new neighbour, please email me on admin@stmaryshorsley.org.uk.   Concerns   There is a baptism on Sunday, it follows both services (1pm) and Ant was hoping some of the traditional service congregation would manage to come along to represent this part of the Church Family.   Eileen  was alone for her prayers this morning, and wonders if another day of the week would make it more accessible for people.   Steve  is sorting out the Wheelhouse for KIDstuf... that's going to be interesting, the set and equipment will be permanently here leaving the willing hands free to be guided to better jobs than shifting stuff from here to East Horsley Village Hall and back. Mind you, 300 people came to the last one, so David is checking maximum capacity etc on the fire regs, and he took the insurance policy away with him today to pour through.  The Youth are having a fantastic time at the West Horsley Village Hall and expect to be there for the foreseeable future.  Steve needs a First Service volunteer to drive the children in batches to the L1FE Service for the last bit of Worship, please contact me if you can drive the Minibus and have a free half hour before Sunday lunch.  Next weekend is when they're off to Carroty Wood, and on Sunday they hope to be on the beach, so think of them, sand and sun and BBQ.  In case you were wondering about the absence of sermon tapes, the tape machine has now been repaired, and is on its way back to me, though we were very tempted to buy a replacement.  Apparently the heads had never been cleaned so they stopped recording.  They have now been done but are still pitted.  They promise me another £100 for new heads would be a waste, so the grand total is about £102 instead of £599 for a new machine.  Result. I have decided to take the machine to church and then do tapes immediately, on demand, while people are having coffee, there is plenty of time then.    June is going to be full of St Mary's Work, I will be at the Wheelhouse all week, then weddings on the Saturday, and Choir at Church and the Sound Desk on Sundays.  I think I will ask Ant if I could have Fridays off for a bit, and still do long days, I shall use the time to think. And learn to pray. And make the Anglican rosary from the kit I have just bought on the internet.  I wonder what prayers I shall have.  The instructions say, because it is Anglican, that you can pray how ever you feel led.  After the scary Nancy Goudie Spiritual Health Weekend, I think it is OK to use material things as spiritual tools, so long as it is biblical and prayerful. I am a bit of a Martha though so I have to watch myself. Please, dear Jesus, help me not mind my husband's driving so we can have a nice trip to Italy over the first weekend in July.  And glorious God, please make it possible for me to tell him nicely when he's about to kill us.  And clever Holy Spirit, make him patient with the road and those on it, and filled with appreciation of the beauty in our world even though he hates heights and tunnels and we have to get past the Alps somehow. And please let there be a church open on the Sunday. I want to know what miserable offenders is in Italian, I expect it sounds much worse. If anyone likes Parmasan, let me know, I intend bringing back a whole one.  Janet, we have some receipts for you, so do pop in.  Thank you for reading.  I would like to improve on my blogger so that it is useful... please comment with your ideas, it will be shorter next time. Love Lucy PS Have a look at the Really Big Chorus website, they gather (or perhaps flock is a better term) at the Albert Hall and perform great works; on Friday I was singing with my dear cousin Anna and 3000 people for Sir David Wilcox, who must be a hundred.  It was the very Italian Verdi Requiem, with the big "crash bang, crash bang, crash bang, dies irae, dies illa" bit from the adverts.  If you want to spectate there's only room for about 200 in the audience.  urlLink www.trbc.co.uk

      Gina, Anthony, Steve, Jill and I sat outside on a lovely sunny day for this week's meeting, and Anthony prayed that we would all look forward to God's love new and have it fresh everyday, not try to store lots up to use later.  I had a flash come into my mind of biting a crisp apple, and my mouth watered, a bit gross, sorry, but I think it was straight out of the beatitudes.  What a lovely morning.  Today was the first day we completed the service book in the meeting; checking, correcting and completing it.    At the 9 0'clock there was 70 adults/2 children, and at L1FE 63/30.  The LTA/TAG children were on half term, so some of them came to L1FE, and some forward to pray and say thank you to the leaders for  Carroty Wood .  This had been excellent, 10 leaders/20 children with 6 family was a perfect balance and the predicted weather arranged itself to rain when they were either indoors, in tents or elsewhere.  The trip to the beach was fab, they had a BBQ and pictures are already available and on display in the Wheelhouse.  These perhaps should go to the website or the diocesan Grapevine or even the Surrey Comet.  Perhaps whoever did them could sort that out.  On the return journey  the minibus  got back to the Wheelhouse making strange noises, and went bang with lots of smoke, specialist advice is awaited from Dagenham Motors and this might be expensive if not terminal.  Anthony is keen to take full advantage of our role in Youth Outreach and wants us to make a grand and comprehensive plan to win grant money going begging for just the sort of activity network that we and Steve should be operating.  It is possible that obtaining the grant will take the sort of tenacity and organisational ability of one of the new members of the 5 year Planning Group, who has the ideal gifts and experience to get this sorted.  We want a double decker activity bus which will be used by our Youth and the youngsters in the wider community, Ant knows exactly what he has in mind.  Once Steve and "the fund manager" are up and running there is no reason why the Surrey grant money shouldn't be sought to fund their time as well as all this.  Meanwhile when the minibus is back, Sue should sort out  a minibus rota , adding Gina and Lucy to the list of volunteers.   The wedding  on Saturday was fine, it was a reaction to his reference to this on Sunday that made Anthony laugh in the sermon.  The  sound desk  was off for the rehearsal, and Anthony would like it on as a default, with the mains switch being all that is necessary for mid-week funerals/wedding practice.  This is with full understanding that the pop of the speakers is not advised.  Anne was showing Karen, apprentice wedding sacristan, the ropes, as Susan Stewart is standing down, and Anne doesn't think she can manage all weddings, always.  We all thought D Day was brilliantly done on the telly, and  the 9 o'clock service  being full was probably due to the feeling and poignancy of the men's actions 60 years ago.  But service sheets ran out, and as hymns were actually printed in them, people were sharing.  I must tell John to do more, 90 even, never mind the waste.  If he needs any help with the extra burden of folding, he will have it.  Lloyd (more later) was there and was pleased to be spontaneously welcomed by 3 separate people.  The sermon was recorded and copied at the church and L1FE therefore had copies.  Anthony has a letter saying how brilliant the L1FE service is.  Brian and Helen (since the baby) now come here instead of the 9 o'clock, they BOTH loved it, even though she thought he'd be 'freaked'.  Not depending on  technology  is working well for the band, Pam is singing with power and confidence, and is really happy to be with Andrew in the team on keyboard mixing the sound from his machine.  The old projector is less distracting for Nic, apparently at  rehearsals this side of things used to take some time.  This is not to say that the high tec stuff isn't fun and a valuable medium, but it is good not to be dependent on it, and it means Sarah doesn't have to do it.  After the L1FE service and clashing with Anne's talk was a consultative meeting with  Lloyd  a church "admiral" from the States and Brussels whom Anthony met at the Christ for the Nations recently. This meeting was held at Glenn's office, a fantastic venue for looking to the future, on top of the control tower at Brooklands.  Here the 2001 5 year plan was agreed to be achieved already in the main, and it was agreed that there is scope for more plans to be easily introduced and prioritised.  Discussions from bigger groups, such as the Leaders meeting at Howard and Pam's were brought and 37 viable aims were reduced to 7 or 8 important and acheivable goals.  It is always to be remembered that Christianity is not founded on our ideas, but God's, it works because we give our resources to God to take action.  Management groups need to focus on the enactment and facilitation of what was discussed... if something needs doing, who is going to do it, "is it I, Lord" (sorry, a bit out of context). Nothing else was brought forward about that meeting except that Lloyd had been to both services, quickly understood the position they and Anthony are in, was welcomed (see above) at the first but no-body came up to him at the second.  This spotlights a particular concern of Anthony's that this service should be especially welcoming.  However, it is to be commended that both congregations are vital, living thriving, and growing, and that is wonderful.  At  the talk by Anne , there were 25 people ( I thought there were much more) and more than £100 was raised.  Anthony wants to shorten the Church fund raising period to allow for a break so as not to exhaust our attention capacity and to limit the tendency to forget the living needs of a growing church to put resources out there were there is human need.  After Sept 2004, we should try to stop spotlighting SMART, assuming we are well on the way to getting the money.  The next SMART meeting is next Monday, and news from John Deal is likely to put new light on the costing of the job and the progress of the contractors. However, the events in the pipe-line are keenly anticipated, the strawberry tea, the swimming party, the June and July organ concerts, and the Russian Singers therefore will be strongly promoted to raise SMART money, and we plan that this should be the peak, so that when we can, we should wind it down quickly to ensure a clear break before the next appeal, whatever that is.  Allowing for the repairs to go as planned, obviously.  The tea and cakes were enjoyed, but it was noted that the placing of the tea cups in the kitchen void our  disabled access  status, and someone has decided the alternative, of bringing the teacups out to the welcome area, is an unacceptable demand on the tea volunteers.  We need a tea trolley, I will get one.  Thought for the day... "What is exciting about your church" Anthony asked me something like that at the job interview more than a year ago, and I said something about the beautiful building.  I had to go home and have a dream which woke me up realising what an idiot, of course it's the people.  We should be an ACTS DO church. Love Lucy

      Today the Church was packed, full of lilies from Saturday's wedding between a french lady and her english groom, appropriate given the news was full of the D Day Commemorative events in Normandy. I found out that D Day is J Jour in French.  It would be T Tag in Germany I suppose.  I also heard Peter Skellern on Songs of Praise singing "Rest in Peace", an incredibly beautiful song which I would like to learn to sing, but couldn't because I would cry through it.  I have just bought the CD from Amazon with it in it, and I am going to take it round to St Martin's to see Caroline and the in-mates whom I miss, actually, and should have given more thought to, especially Nobby (Clarke obviously). Back to the service, it was excellent, with Richard playing the organ as Chris was away, and we had some jolly and good hymns and songs, but not enough service sheets, because as I said, the church was packed and neither I nor John anticipated the demand.  Someone made Anthony laugh, and I thought it was David, but he strongly denied this and wants to know who has usurped this rare privilege - NOTHING distracts Anthony, who could it have been.  Dear "Good Morning Lord" Tom was very moving in his prayers, I feel so peaceful listening to him chat easily with his friend and Master.  Jill was brave and so proud to tell us of her father's role at the landings, her trace of emotion professionally controlled made her story more poignant.  God bless the righteous brave, who have kept the Greatest and the second commandments and God forgive the manifold sins and wickedness of confessed sinners.  And God forgive me.  Pam and Alan were worried about not having received a service sheet for June, but they are not reading or anything so I didn't send them one, and they can look at the one in the porch if they think I have made an error.  I heard muttering in the ranks about Anthony's dismissal omitting a thanks to Richard for playing, so I rushed after him once choir prayers were over and grunted "thank Richard" in case he would want to go back to the microphone, but I made a mess of it, and Richard was playing anyway, I am sure it will be fine, but I felt Anthony would want the info, it's just that it ended up sounding like an order.  Sorry Ant. The sermon had been taped successfully and copied immediately the service ended, which was fun, Anthony was armed with it for the L1FE service, if he had lost his voice on the way, they could have played him on the tape machine!  In the afternoon, Anne did her talk, which is also taped and a copy is in the bookshelf if anyone wants it.  Not many people were there, but only one cake (ginger) of 5 went back to where it came from unopened.  At 12 slices each cake, I make that 60 people unless some people like me had seconds.  Last time she asked if there were any questions, and I think that was a good way to end it.  This time, she was exhausted I think, minutes before the talk she was burrowing behind the altar hauling out boxes and papers looking for one important picture to display.  With no questions, the event just stopped, we clapped and then were told to walk about and have tea.  Last time Ann did a small speech of thanks, I dunno, it seemed more subdued, I think it was a bit disappointing not to have more unfamiliar faces, only 10.  The textiles are fabulous, these and the B+W photos are going to be made into graphics for notelets.  I am a bit worried about the Magazine people's response to the drinks reception, only 4 acceptances and 10 refusals, I  might have to postpone.  Zoe and Anthony's BBQ is getting more interest, Ann (SMART), Anne (MU/Choir), and Gina + Tony can come and I have heard of no refusals.  I was able to thank personally Doris, who is apparently in a bit of a mess with business stuff a bit over her head, for the gift of a beautiful music book.  I confessed to her that I had it instead of handing it over immediately to others, but I said it was interesting and encouraging, and an important book for our church music leaders to read and enjoy, as it was inspired to be a bridge between musical traditions that might lose sight of Judaic and Christian history.  It seems that the ecstacy of Christian worship continued the Jews' way of worshipping their One God in movement and voice, in Christian praise of the Trinity, but different cultures and generations differed on matters of taste as still happens, but something like a thread of God's beauty lives through all dispute in some music from all ages and society, and this is underpinned by a motivation to learn and share in other people's experience of God based on LOVE.  Today the movement, attitudes and instrumental song and singing of our contemporary service most closely matches the type of worship Jesus would have understood, with the chants we have at the ancient Evensong Service and BCP Communion recognisable to the Acts 2 Church! The complexities and extreme style of classical music and the polyphony of Hymns as we know them, were products of human creativity closely linked to the world altar - even if the composers were laying their gifts on the Church's Altars, it may have been a human ego who commissioned great works, and we should not be afraid to stop treating them as relics worthy of worship in themselves. The big question discussed in the book, and throughout Church Music History, is whether music should rouse emotion and feeling, or if it should sublimate it.  A desire to do good works arises from faith, but our right humility should not make us feel we should put perfect offerings on altars, or that anybody elses' offering is something we should judge.  I found out that there are 7 women in Horsley who go to St Mary's who went to LEH in Hampton; Old girls include Chris, Sheila, me ('80), Maureen, Sue('81), Wendy('79), Janet M.  That must be a phenomenal statistic.  All Christian.  Ant, you should go and talk to them.  Clive and Munro are at, it's not NADFAS but it sounds similar, something to do with huge engined cars going round a banked circuit north of Watford.  And afterwards there is a concert of hip-hop (or as Clive put it, loud disco music) and Munro is at the front allowing the noise to damage his hearing.  He is waiting for 50 cents, the rude chap who hangs upside down in videos and swears and is full of bullets.  Anthony, this is what is competing with you in today's society.  That and Karate round at the village hall on Thursday Nights.  I do think you should have some quiet lessons so you can pressure point Joel before he does something he regrets.  By the way, I strongly recommend buying a church kneeler for the footwell of the front  passenger seat in your car.  It is so comfortable on long journeys having that extra bit of cushion for the ankle and knee, and if the driver is getting a bit above himself, it is nice to have both feet firmly grounded in prayer.  Only a quid, everyone should get one.  I've put ours in the Ace ready for Mont Blanc Tunnel,  Does anyone know a bible story to rival the Hobbit for going through and under mountains, that takes about 20 minutes to tell, so I can distract him? It's not a valley of the shadow of death, that's the trouble. Thou annointest my head with oil, you share your last supper with me, you gave me your life, I am not worthy of your great sacrifice, nor of that given by those who died at Normandy.  I lifteth mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh mine help... Love Lucy

      I was up all night worrying about what I wrote yesterday.  And spent too long in the bath this morning reading the 39 Articles of Faith, and feel really sorry for the doubts of yesterday.  Of course it is completely stupid and wrong to try to be independent of Our Father, Jesus taught every day that this parent child relationship is the key to everything good about being alive, and trying to be independent is the reason we fall away lost, and lonely and afraid.  Our human need in error desires that we become better than our elders and previous generations, instead of being full of wonder and respect for them, grateful for the support we have from their past sacrifices, and aware of our responsibility to the children of our future.  Our uniqueness is something we imagine makes us similar to God, forgetting we are made, not begotten, and only Jesus' doing word has made us belong again to God.  Meanwhile, we are to learn about lifting.  Pam is doing a talk with participation in Saturday 19th June in the afternnon, for people who have been putting their back into L1FE.  It is not exclusive, I reminded her of the work I know is done by the Churchyard gang, the cleaners, the bell ringers, they all are vulnerable to physical strain.  This was something we discussed ages ago, I am so glad she remembered, but the recent increase in bad backs and calls for therapy made her determined to do it.  Apparently when the huge boxes were bought for the L1FE equipment, no-one wheeled them, and there was no ramp to enable them to be rolled into the van, and they were lifted wrongly  with inevitable heavy strain.  That must change.  Glen wants publicity for the outing in November, I am not sure what it is about, but I will find out.  I must go, Papa, I love you, sorry about yesterday xLucy

      The Pentecost Weekend was very busy, a pretty bride married her groom on Saturday, and I have a tape of the service to send to a young woman in America who is coming home to be married next year and wants to know something to set her mind on.   The ushers were asking me what they should be doing, so I looked wise and made something up, and checked with Anne when I saw her, only to discover I was completely wrong.  Mind you I was right about how to recognise the Vicar when he got there.  I said he would be straight out of a shower and in a hurry,  and just then there was a spectacular squealing of brakes, and a couple of minutes later there he was.  We had been willing angels to hold whoever it was back from any impact, and no harm was done, in fact it put a big boost into the energy of the ceremony, because all the guests and the wedding party were outside and saw it all happen.    The choir had practiced an anthem but managed not to look too disappointed when an usher handed me a tape and a back-up cd of Charlotte Church doing something.  No-one had realised we don't have a tape/cd player at church, so Anthony rang Zoe and she rushed round to my office and got mine, and drove it to the Church.  So I played that for them while they signed the register.  They would have loved what the choir had prepared, and they will never know.  On Sunday Anthony was brilliant, so much so that while I was paying complete attention to him, I didn't notice his sermon was not going on the tape.  Jay who was leading, was very intense, Pentecost is obviously very important to him.  And it must be important to Jill too, because she had come to choir practice and was there for the anthem.   Oh. So sad.  It was shocking, all over the place, people were singing other people's parts and coming in with them instead of where they should be, and instead of "still their heav'nly music floats o'er all the weary world" it was a relief when we got to the end all at the same time. "The best laid plans of mice and men are aften gang aglay". We are going to have a conductor and Norman has what it takes so Jill will approach him in the very near future.  What we need are commandments so we can keep them, and do poor old Tallis justice.  Going wrong helps with the humility, and the Holy Spirit must have decided we needed reminding that it's faith and not good works that fulfill God's purpose, WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING.  What wine shall we get for the Organ Recital?  A bright looking chap is coming to play to help us fund-raise, and I think I will be in charge of the catering, unless someone leaps into the breach.  This might be Jody, her baptism candles are so beautiful by the way, she writes the baby's name on with quick drying silver paint and little flourishes.  Her skill comes from years of pursuing a hobby of canal boat art, even the church match box and my waste paper bin is painted with flowers in primary colours on a black back-ground.  Anne and I agreed we should have a collie dog with a hanky round its neck to match.   DISASTER  The minibus has let us down seriously this week.  Var from Bookham Baptists has arranged to take kids desparate for an outing away all week, and we were going to let him use our bus.  But a huge bang and puff of smoke meant we had to tell him he couldn't, with hardly any notice at all.  He has arranged at very short notice, parents giving lifts to 15 children, hiring a replcement bus on Thursday and Friday, and he didn't need all that.  I think I am meant to be in charge of the minibus, but I don't check it or anything, I just pass on the bad news about things not working to Anthony and hope he knows what to do... then if he tells me, I do it.  Dagenham Motors had only just serviced it, and were kind enough to come and get it.  Of course, naturally, after an initial puff of smoke and a couple of miles of cartoon exhaust, it worked fine and they couldn't find anything wrong.  But he is doing a check tomorrow, and maybe, hopefully, he will know what it was and will sort out the oil problem (again?).  Tom said something male about it sounding like a piston had gone.  Daganham Motors wondered if the oil was low, so Anthony put even more in than usual.  We need a bucket to collect the drips under the sump, it's ridiculous.  Soon I'll be able to a handbrake stunt turn into the Rectory Car Park.  The Scrabble Club has just gone, Gina brought me a cup of tea and a huge piece of fruit cake.  They miss young Joel, his 10 year old vocabulary was quite impressive and they did enjoy having him play if his school finished in time.  Anthony says I shouldn't mind the strange pop pop sounds I might hear from time to time in his garden.  He has borrowed an air pistol for a couple of months.  urlLink Ezekial 6:6   He is going through flower pots apparently.  I am going to Harry Potter tonight, I wonder if it will send different messages now I am Christian?  I don't see why, I am quite a calm person, not like the fundamentalists in America who want to have "The Whale" reclassified as a fish because that's what it is in the Bible.  We are so arrogant to limit God's Word by our understanding of it.  I am always left saddened by the thought that God, obviously, was curious when he set creation going, ending up with us.  And we are curious too, but acting on our God-made nature to enquire and research in order to understand, and without the wonderful omniscience of time and space and spirit that is God, we condemn ourselves to a life of bitter frustration or passive resignation, in both cases denying our nature.  It seems, sometimes, to me that God made a cruel paradox and condemns us with our natural born desire to know what we haven't yet experienced, to the nasty brutal rejection and loneliness of the Fall, longing for oblivion and release from the fear of being without him.  Our alternative, is to choose a willing slavery, never maturing to independent "adulthood" and friendship as one would aspire to do with a parent in a healthy relationship, instead always asking for guidance.  We have to acknowledge our pathetic wimpdom ALL THE TIME, in order to allow God to use us and be his servants in loving each other and bringing the world back to be in his kingdom.  Which is quite right, but seems a bit fishy sometimes.  Or whaley even.  Wouldn't it be better if we had not evolved along God's preordained path to the disastrous mess our world is in while the dayspring dawn of the Messianic era 2000 years ago takes its time to become the full flowing day of our return to the Kingdom?  The disciples got it within days of Christ's death and resurrection, but it's taking a bit longer for everyone else. However, I know a remnant of humanity will hear "Le Verbe" as the french put it and come together to love and be loved.  Who are we to say how long God's put aside for this part of his agenda, what spiritual DNA is working to evolve our hearts and minds closer to God's perfect plan. But when we say "world without end" what does that mean... is our development an eternal and infinite process which must end in our perfect relationship with God? At a point infinitely far away and therefore never to happen?  I am comforted by the realisation that half of infinity is infinity and therefore God is always there for me, whatever dark place I am hiding in, irrespective of how many of his children need him too.  And that all of humanity can exist in one individual who will take the right step towards his loving Father and sacrifice time (life) and space (the body) to be born again in the Spirit. Love, truly Thank you , dear God, for being infinitely there, Lucy

      Tuesday 29th June, I skived off choir practice in order to have an early night, ready for starting the journey to Dover at 5.45am.  As usual, we left half an hour late, into a hot dawn with clear roads all the way to the ferry.  The Ace is a pretty little car and from behind it seems like a scale model compared to the 4 by 4s all around us, and we never worry about the paint being scraped by passers by.  It is fantastic to have a car with no locks, car alarm, seat belts, roll bar, it sharpens the mind and relaxes the neuroses. What a lot of France there is, so many roads to choose from.  We chickened out and went peage until Troyes and then navigated to the Chateau Beauregard in the Region Cote d'Or south of Montbard, east of Dijon,  between Vitteau and Saulieu, and what a view. The shed contained a Bugatti, and Porsche and a Ferrari covered with straw dust and pigeon droppings, the Ferrari's windows were open and cobwebs filled in the gaps.  The gardens were herb scented, labradors intrigued, and the wine, mise en chateau.  I have a magazine cutting of the bath in my scrap book, the huge nickel fitted one with feet, heaven after the long drive. We drove in convoy to a village restaurant "Le Medieval", where I accidently ordered kidneys to follow poached eggs in Balsamic black gravy, but I think the tame "wild boar" kept as a pet in the house nearby had distracted me.  It had destroyed the front garden and was trying to get in the house, which it had apparently also reduced to dust.  We found out that the chef, Joel Criblier, of whom the area was very proud, had put together the meal in haste in order to gaze in awe at our cars.  We did make a rather spectacular bunch in the main square. Our hosts were charming, but our French was totally dependent on Richard, who charmingly rescued the wallowing attempts to make conversation and made what I was trying to say sound much more interesting than it was. Next morning the journey through the Jura mountains was spiced with mountain roads and we followed the Jag which was such fun, Kirk made it his duty to give the new boy a good run and we loved it.  It was good exercise for us, as we needed the experience in this Ace, the last one was a different kettle of fish.  Passing annoying youths in charge of huge farm vehicles teetering with hay had us all steaming with frustration, until a large frothy coffee, or tooth stripping espresso calmed us all down at a road side cafe. I knew we had to drive straight at Lac Leman in Nyon and not turn up to the left until we saw the whites of it's eyes, but the map didn't show the T junction where Richard and Trish went right, and I waved left and ended up on the hill side road instead of the coast road with fab views but wrong.  Along a bit there was a cut back, and we guessed we would meet them quay side, where we enjoyed the weirdest looking battered fish and chips.  I felt like Gulliver. I don't know why we lost the group over the Simplon pass, but we were running a bit hot and caught in traffic lights.  Clive was driving with a bad eye and sunglasses on and didn't see the diversion over the left to avoid a road that was no-longer there and we had to wait for the batch of cars behind us to pass before we could reverse and get over as we should have done.  How embarrassing.  We had a beer after buying a map, so we wouldn't be so dependent on Trisha's instructions for the last Alpine bit to the Auberge Edelweis.  This had a pool but required the wearing of a hat.  It was not open when we arrived and not open when we left, not for motoring tourist then. The long table was charmingly served at supper.  The next morning a lot of smoke seemed to be exuding from the Jag's rear brake drums, so we left the motorway for an investigation and were told he had left the hand brake on.  I think it was freudian; all the left things, the handbag at the restaurant, the wallet in the cafe, the handbrake on the motorway were displaced protests for having to drive on the right. A sunny drive through admiring towns and a swift coffee beside Lago d'Orta (hotel La Sibilla Cusiana) and motorway all the way to, around and beyond Milan, we cocked up Piacenza, but ended up alright, and waited in the square at Vernasca for the weekend to begin...
