       Today might have been the dullest day all summer all I did was play NBA Ballers all-day   Well every Wednesday I get to go bowling with a few friends that would be fun.   At least my sister wont be around for 23 days shes goin to Europe while I stay here with my parents and maybe...... hopefully....... prolly...... go to Cancun or LA.   My Grandma gave me $50 and my sister more I wonder how much but Im grateful for what I got so I wont worry about it.   O well Ill find somrthin to do on the internet maybe pogo.com or cokemusic
