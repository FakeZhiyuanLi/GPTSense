Haahaas mayb we were too lucky...   yups...Since pri sch, i was realli lucky to b placed in very nice n   enjoyable classes...til now i guess...   ya...mayb coz i had alot of very close frens in those classes...   thus became too reliant on them le...   But realli enjoy e gd (slack) times together...haahaas   always miss gp outings durin my sec 1 n 2 days...   yi,u n fish always went to mac while im havin band prac...   bt still very close to u'all...haahaas coz of all e gp gatherings we   had durin lunch n breaks...then always crap in class too...   Gettin out of pt le...ya...   just to encourage u to stay strong and wait patiently 4 e   sunshine aft e rain...while in e meantime savour every min of   happiness u have k?

        Geez...slept at round 2.30am ystdae...aft e swimming events... yups...met up wif e class peeps at 6am at woodlands control station this morn... tired....ya...bt mostly quite sad...swimming had been my life 4 e past wk...hees Ya...hmm as usual kinda disappointed in e class unity tt we hav again... joined e s10 peeps... hmm..dun realli feel like elaborating..makes me feel worse... yups...surprisingly e big walk ended early round 9:50am so i managed to rush to church... Hees realli glad to worship Jesus...yups today's sermon was realli nice...mostly on e apostle creed... Most imptly, was realli inspired by this worship song...     What a friend we have in Jesus All our griefs and sins to bear What a privilege to carry Everything to God in prayer. O what peace we often forfeit O what needless pain we bear All because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer.     Have we trials and temptations Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged Take it to the Lord in prayer Can we find a friend so faithful Who will all our sorrows share Jesus knows our every weakness Take it to the Lord in prayer      Are we weak and heavy laden Cumbered with a load of care? Precious Savior still our refuge Take it to the Lord in prayer. Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer; In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee. Thou wilt find a solace there.    yups...was realli tired of everything when i went for snr 2dae despite of my enthusiasm... Or rather sld be feel like giving up on e class... haahaas ya....bt gained strength from Him.. =) What a friend we have in Jesus... Hmm...to Jasper and Fenella... Don't give up on e class yet... Jasper ur right...as individuals...e class is nice... however as a gp...it kinda feel realli different... a little fake and mean i guess... Sometimes..realli feel like breaking down in class... realli disappointed with e amt of class spirit we have.... mayb wad we need is time... hopefully things will get better someday..somehow...somewhere...
