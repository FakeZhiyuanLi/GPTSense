      I hate that I just quoted rolling stones, but it seemed appropriate.   I couldn't even go to memorial park and read my damn book today. I totally panicked and started crying. it feels like something HUGE has happened, when really life is the same as always. It must just be withdrawls or something. Finally got relief for my migraines though. Thank god. It was making life hell.  I wish my friends weren't such bitches.

      Shit fuck crap bitch ass damn bastard cunt dickhole pussy fuck shit sda;lksadj'sdfoijg.  I am not doing well right now.  After suffering two days straight from the worst headache EVER, I have to sit here and talk to Ben about the chick he likes when I liked him forever. He has to tell me whats so perfect about her and blah blah, and then I'm supposed to give advice. Right. Me. The girl who can't ever keep relationships, who dumps guys once they like her, who is completely scared of commitment, but cries herself to sleep because she craves it. Yeah, please tell the girl that liked you about the girl you like who isn't her.   I just want to smack him.   It's not like I can tell him anything about people I like since one of them goes out with my best friend, so he's out of the picture, and the other is Ben's best friend.  And it's not like anyone takes my crushes seriously anyway.  Just because I am attracted to a lot of people at one time doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when I'm rejected. It's not like I put them up as back-ups. I am hurt everytime I see a guy with a girl. To be this alone feeling this crappy is not fun. fuck all you "glad to be single" fuckers. You obviously are content with your singleness because some loser treated you crappy. I haven't even had the chance to be treated fully crappy. I am never happy. I am always sad. And even when I think I'm happy, I am actually sad. It's all a stupid circle of hell.  My hands are still shaking. I can't believe he is telling me about this girl. It's too hard to be supportive. I mean, he put me through rejection hell. Not even normal rejection...he just plain ignored me until it all cleared itself up. Not a "not interested" or a "just friends" bullshit. Just: PRETEND SARAH ISN'T THERE COMPLETELY DEPRESSED BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HER. I WILL GET MY BEST FRIEND TO CHEW HER OUT FOR BEING STALKER-ISH.  creepy stupid fucker. usually I would do everything in my power to get him to not like this stupid bitch, but i realize that is low, and will not resort to that. I just want someone to talk to about the way that I feel. I want to lay in bed a sob right now. But if I do, my parents will ask me what is wrong and then shove pills down my throat to make it ALL BETTER. fuck shit fuck. I just want to cry with someone. I just want someone to listen.  beyond that...  ... I just want to rip my hair out of my scalp. Or ride my bike to the ocean and drown myself. I can't seem to feel content. Everything has a problem with it.  fuck.

      After my passionate entry the other day, I had a political debate with my friend online. Since I'm not a fan of typing a lot on an IM screen late at night, I told him I would answer his question later when we went to see Fahrenheit 9/11. He, however, took that as an "excuse" not to answer him and got on my back about how I never defend myself correctly and he's always right. That's actually bullshit that I shouldn't have gotten so pissed about, but I did anyway. I was up half the night searching online for facts that proved everything he said wrong. I accomplished it quite thoroughly, but the next morning I realized how stupid it was. I was wasting so much of my time and energy and sanity on these political ideals, when really no one would ever be "right". So, after much thinking, I have simply decided to not care. When I am old enough to vote, I may or may not do it at all. Maybe by then I will be ready for the mess again....who knows? I guess, I can have my ideals, but I am going to keep them to myself. Why should I drive myself apart from my democrat friends if it's over some stupid political crap that doesn't really effect our relationship at all. *sigh* I just don't care. So I'll see the movie, I'll respect the filmakers views, and hope (althought I know he WON'T) he respects mine.  SO FUCK IT!  P.S. GO TEXAS LONGHORNS! CWS 2004!

      I don't want to get into mushy political crap here because that just makes me tired, but I do want to expose my dirty thought of the day:  I wish I could just tie Micheal Moore to a steel door and shoot him with a machine gun. So much that no one would recognize him.   Ok, that is a bit rude and disgusting. Plus, it would only make us republicans look worse, therefore accelerating the disappearance of our morals and views forever. If that were to happen, it seems that either the U.S.'s population would begin to dwindle because of more and more abortions, or it would dwindle because we are getting the crap kicked out of us by terrorists and no pansy democrats want to do anything about it.  Or it will dwindle because Micheal Moore made the nation more stupid everytime someone watched one of his disgustingly unrealistic films.   I can't wait to see what kind of shit he put on camera for this film. I bet Susan Surrandon and Tim Robbins will jump for joy. Woopie! We are celebrities who are now allowed to stick are fat asses in politics as if we know what was going on! yay!   I say give up Micheal Moore to the terrorists. Nobody cares if he's beheaded. It's better than innocent civilians that the terrorists have claimed.  *Go America* at least I love my country enough to fight for what is right.

I hate it when people are only in show choir because they are pretty I hate when people refuse to learn I hate people who cannot hold up their side of a debate I hate people who will not try to change my mind on an issue (I love to debate, but I guess some people are freaked out by my outspoken nature.

Sadly, I spent a week with my dad, and I'm now back to where I began. *phew*) I hate sunburns I hate being hungry I hate stupid movies that have no reason to be shown  I hate technology (somedays I would rather just have my records and my typewriter.

      Simon and Garfunkel, the pair, are a bit overrated in my view. Not their music or their lyrics or the skills of Paul Simon by any stretch, but the importance of Art Garfunkel (am I spelling that right...or does it even matter?). You see, he does NOTHING. Paul obviously has the writing skills with his touching lyrics and soft melodies, and he also has the musical talent with his lovely voice and harmonious guitar. Then there's Art. Singing harmonies that are sometimes not completely in tune, and just standing there like the overrated obnoxious looking ass he is. I mean, listen to Paul Simon's solo stuff! He's genius -hands down. Art has nothing to do with the success of "Simon and Garfunkel". He is simply part of the title, but nothing more.  So when you think, "Oh, I totally want to listen to some Simon and Garfunkel" you should be thinking "Oh, I totally want to listen to some Simon and Simon because Paul Simon is so cool and talented."  THE FUCKING END.  P.S. Ben Folds Five rocks. Ben shouldn't have been an ass and dropped the band. Even if it wasn't out of assholeness...he shouldn't have dropped them. T.E. (again)

      Well, I just went on what I think was a date. Or hanging out with a newly single guy who I hang a fling with a year ago or so. It was good and everything, I just don't feel anything with him like I wish I felt. I guess I just have in my head the kind of person that I want to fall in love with....and I don't want to be occupied with this guy if the right guy comes along. Or maybe I'm just a fucking idiot.  Who knows?  I wish I was 18, this is something I would like to smoke over...I just don't want to get caught. lol. I'm such a pussy. *sigh* whatever.  I'm out...hope Ben replies with a mutual want for coffee shop time. I need caffeine dreams so I can cool down.  Oh! and I went over to ben's yesterday for his "party" (which was lame...as always) But he looked soooooooooooo cute. God damn him. God damn him and his stupid shirt. Oh well, I'm gonna pretend it didn't faze (is that right?) me and go on with life.  I base too many of my feelings on boys.  I fucking hate boys.

      WOW...it seriously feels like I've lived 2 days in only this one day. But it was better than usual. I just slept all day...and I didn't shower...and I watched tv a lot. Oh! And ate. That was nice. And now I'm starting to think that maybe I should start planning more things, working on my "look", cutting down on tv, and eating less.   My life goals are completely opposite from my everday life. Funny how that works.  However, I am very excited for the debut of sex and the city on tbs (I have basic basic cable, so I have only been able to rent seasons...and that sucks). My vcr is already set to record every single episode. Ok, ok, I know I am a total reject, but the idea of watching pretty women fail at relationships is one of the brighter aspects of my day.   YAY!  Plus, my cousins come in on Tuesday! Woot! One is 6 and the other is 4...I think. Something like that...I lose track. Anyway, they are cute as hell, and I can't wait to babysit them. (Plus, that means money, but that isn't nearly as important). At least it will get me out of bed and keep me from sleeping my days away (when I'm not working). Mom says I have to get a second job though. God damn her. She is like hell in a fucking box. GRR.  I really want to talk to ben. I am sure he couldn't care less about me, but I really really just want him to hear me out sometime. We used to   talk about anything. I hope he doesn't mind listening to me. I just want him to know how I feel, and I want to know how he's been feeling lately...  I miss ben. *sigh* I scared him away by liking him. damn me damn me damn me.  I need to go finish crying now. Ta ta.

      Good...evening, I guess. Seems like it's evening now. My day was hectic as hell...but now it's settled down and I'm bored again. On a good note: anxiety way way down! It was so easy buying things today. Man, what a relief. One day at a time, one day at a time.  I did get Tina a b-day present at last. She always buys me shit, so I figured since I had money to spend, why not spend it on her? I do have to get Joslyn a present still. Dammit. The t-shirt I want to get her is out of stock on oddshops.com. Maybe I'll find it somewhere else.  And Geoff is hitting on me again. YES!!!!!!!!  I'm out...

      I totally love the Simpsons. Hilllllllarious. The best character: Roy. He's only in one episode...but he makes me laugh.  And laughter is good. Today I saw a new psychiatrist...he kinda seemed assholish, but I hate to transfer AGAIN. It's annoying. At least I still have my therapist. She is the one that actually has to be nice since I talk to her about things. The psychiatrist just gives me meds. He did say, however, that if I kept being sparatic with taking them, I will continue to get "discontinuation" syndrome. It's like, you get headaches, muscle aches, dizziness, become disoriented, nervous, weak, and massively hormonal. UGH. Now that is a recipe for living HELL. Good thing it sucks otherwise the meds would be nixed.  Wow, senior pics coming up. Isn't that weird? I feel like I'm too little to be a senior. I just still feel like I'm 15 years old. It's scary. I don't want to grow up....  It's also SAD that I am posting on this everyday. UGH. I hate summer. I'm going now. hahaha. Wow, I actually think people care. WOW!

      well. today, unhappy and unmedicated, i have officially freaked out the parentals. so now i expect weeks of shit on how I can't leave the house because I am emotionally unstable and blah blah blah fuck fuck blah.  I just feel weak and tired and lonely. All I want is for them to let me sleep. But no. They give me chores, tell me i will be grounded if i don't do them, and then they leave. all i want to do is throw myself out the window, but knowing my luck, i'll survive with a bruise or two and then everyone i know will stop trusting me because i am psycho.  i suppose that is iniciative enough.  and as I go through this today, I realize I have no one to call. No one would even listen for two seconds.  I HATE being lonely. I hope this gets over really really soon.

      Well, my kmorg went kiputz a few months ago and I was hoping they would bring it back even if I had to start over. Sadly, they have been very slow - which is understandable. I probably would've thrown my computer out of a window. But that's me. I need internet journal crap. I think it's a sick sick obsession. Ugh.  Saw Harry Potter 3 today. It's a pretty good movie, actually, even though they left a SHITLOAD out from the book. I was quite angry (since I am a massive potter-nerd). Either way, the two boys are becoming so handsome! It makes me giggle. I may be 17 and they are 14, but i can still think they are cute. I went with my youth group to the movie and it was really fun....except that my best friend is dating the guy I like. We talked about it, and she feels bad, but I just can't stand it. Anyway, I went over to kp's house afterwards and halfway through the late night friends episode realized I was a complete fifth wheel. scott had kp (not officially, but it is obvious they like each other), and zach had elise. Who did I have? The fucking couch I guess. Or maybe my wild cherry pepsi. He was a fun date. So I just got up and left. I was pretty upset. Being single is so hard right now. I'm at the point where I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about how I am feeling. I guess everyone is tired of knowing how I feel. They just don't care.  Plus, my guy friends are assholes. if a certain boy whose name starts with E fucking whines about me calling him an asshole anymore, he will get punched. Has he ever considered the fact that I said that b/c he IS an asshole? I was tired of him ignoring what I had to say and always turning the conversation back to him. I would ask him a question, he'd answer, I'd respond, then I would tell a little bit on my own answer, he would NOT respond, then he would go back to the part about him. Maybe he doesn't realize it...I dunno. Either way, I was fed up with being overshadowed by his trivial problems. I didn't want to vent necessarily - I just wanted to be acknowledged.  I hate my life today.  But at least I have my new journal. Sigh.

      I am worried about college again. I am worried SICK. So much, that everything I do reminds me of college . Where should I go??? THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTION YET UNANSWERED!!! I already know I want to major in secondary vocal music education and vocal performance and minor in theatrical arts. I want a school with an AWESOME choir, good teachers, small classes, and a stellar music program. So naturally the first school I thought of was: St. Olaf. Well, now I'm not sure. I mean, their choir IS stellar. I about died when I heard them... and it takes a lot for me to be impressed. I almost always have something critical to say. But then I heard Concordia College's choir (in Moorhead) and they were awesome as well. What the bloody hell am I going to do? What if I get to college and I hate it? I seriously refuse to transfer... start all over again. Or, what if I don't go to St. Olaf and I end up hating the choir at the school I do go to!? Or I love St. Olaf's choir, but their theatre department starts sucking? Can I actually find a school with everything that I need? And what if I get a boyfriend? What if he wants to go to school in Texas? What if I think I love him? WHAT IF I DON'T GET THE SCHOLARSHIPS I NEED!??!?!?!?!?!  I&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; am  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  freaking  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  out.

      So after I returned home,&nbsp; all bitchy and bitter from losing a great guy, I realized just how selfish I really am.  On Thursday, my second cousin Jesse Greise went Kayaking on the Papillion creek. It had rained 3 inches the night before, so the falls were worse than usual. They pulled in his kayak and him as well. His body was recovered Friday night.  Funny how when I returned home, my parents conviently forgot to tell me that he was dead. In fact, I found out 10 minutes before we left to attend his wake. I didn't know him that well- I only saw him at his graduation 3 years ago, and the graduation of his brother this year. I played with his sister a few times when I was a kid, but we were never close. In reality, I shouldn't be so upset. But I am. Just attending the wake got me all frazzled. Hell, I just saw this family about 2 months ago. They were celebrating Tony's graduation with yet another hog roast. I met Shane and Steven again (even though they didn't remember me...haha) and I talked to Cindy (his mom) who is always so so sweet. I ate the cake, I bitched about being there, and then I met the graduate for two seconds and went home. Woopie. Funny how God works. Had I known that Jesse would be laid to rest only a few months after, I may have been less eager to leave.   So, while I was at Triennium, praying to God to bring me someone to love, a mother was losing her child.&nbsp; A young woman was losing her fiancee. A girl was losing her brother.  To hundreds of people... a best friend was lost.   To be in that church last night and see all the people who loved this kid, I guess I realized how cool he must've been. I hope my church is as packed when I die someday. At least you can see the good in that.   So, if you are from Omaha, you may have heard of this young man, a junior (to be senior) at UNO, a graduate of Skutt High School, and State wrestling champ.  Please keep his family in your prayers. Don't pray for me -please. Pray for his mother and father, his 3 brothers and 1 sister, and his fiancee that he left behind.  P.S. My car broke down. Today sucks.

I do have his screen name... so hopefully it won't end to abruptly.   Still doesn't mean I'm not looking! I used to think Jeff was perfect.... then found out he was an imperfect, insensative piece of shit.  And New York is very very very far away.  ...

Just sit face to face with someone I hardly know and talk. I find conversation...INTELLIGENT conversation....beautiful. I just need that.  This means I will spending MORE time at caffeine dreams reading my book and waiting for Mr. intelligent-conversation.  *sigh* &nbsp; P.S. I need to stop writing poems. That is my new goal. lol.

      The masses scream I huddle here I am a fetus I am the beginning In a crowded womb where My brain is but a hole I will not breathe this air I breathe the protection of a familiar placenta A blanket of tissue and blood  Damn I've returned Lying in my bathtub Porcelain and rust Cries of maternal cravings I need a loving touch Here I soak in More blood  More tissue My own rotten life spilled like the guts Of slaughtered calf Oh! To die like the lucky! To never count the seconds Never having time to numb to the pain  Oh, porcelain Like a little doll you smile I see velvet, I see mahogany I see the black and I am zen Little painted faces With little painted tears  I painted your face A canvas like wine Turning a crimson as it hit the air  You are on my body now Dried And burned An end so perfect  Because it is the end.

      And we're off...  I really need someone to hang out with tonight. I want to see A Clockwork Orange SOOO bad, but I don't feel like seeing it by myself (which is unusual in itself. usually i'm like: fuck off! I'm watching a movie!). And I decided to skip the Tilly and the Wall concert tonight. *tear* I hope everyone there rocks out for me. I just didn't feel like doing that alone either (I got cancelled on by a sick Kelsey this morning).   For once, I ACTUALLY want company. And not because I want to bitch...because I want to have some god damn fun! I never have fun! I want to light something on fucking fire and then chase people with it.  Or smoke.  and I never smoke (except at concerts...and it's only around people who I know won't tell me 'stick up the ass' friends).  I just feel crazy.  And NO ONE IS BLOODY HOME.  Fuck my friends and their work schedules. Damn Damn Damn.  And I'm done...

      So, while I would usually post something I consider witty or knowledge (they don't go together for me), I am in a rather SHITTY (for lack of a better word) mood. And I am watching the show King of Queens and wondering, do they ever have sex? I think they are one of those modern couples that is "in love" for the convience of having each other...and then I wake up and realize it's a fucking show and I shouldn't be analyzing it.  So I shall watch King of the Hill instead. NO ANALYZING REQUIRED. How refreshing.  I got new glasses today. I usually wear contacts, but my new glasses are just so emo. I may just wear them as I cry to Dashboard Confessional into my Fruit Loops. Except I HATE Dashboard. AKA Chris Carabba. Anyone who names themselves a band name is an idiot. Like Connor Oberst. Get a fucking band and THEN name yourself Bright Eyes. I mean, he USED to have a band. But now he's on the cutting edge of the Emo scene. I only sort of like him because he is making Omaha famous. And I love my Omaha.  Tomorrow I shall late night swim in the lake behind my friend's cabin. And you want to know why? Because I fucking can. NO PARENTS. I feel freedom like any budding adolescent would when parents are absent. The first month of college will be like heaven on a budget. Until I start to miss my dog and then I will cry. Damn the dog and his big brown eyes. DAMN HIM!  Basically this is my just rambling about shit that doesn't matter to anyone besides me. You know what I need? I need older friends who can pull me out of the last rut of immaturity that I am in. Or just have older friends so I can say "Hey I have older friends and they are so much cooler". And then we can light stuff on fire and throw it at little children and bask in the lovliness of our immaturity that was never really lost - just buried until we turned 18 and left the house. Am I the only girl that constantly wants to light things on fire? Or steal street signs? Or do something stupid and juvenile just because it's not murdering someone--but it's still thrilling?  I think I need to go to church this sunday and talk to God. I doubt he would be happy with my lighting things on fire thoughts. Then again, when has he stopped me? The only thing stopping me is my lame friends. hahaha. I shall do something "bad" before I leave high school, dammit. I shall make some adult shake their head with disdain! I shall piss authority figures off and I WILL be PROUD! No more prudeness! Well, in the "doing bad things" sense. Not in the kissy-having-sex sense. Ya know. That's a little more difficult. Calls for personal reflection. And frankly that makes my head hurt.  So now that I have OFFICIALLY bored the shit out of myself, I am going to push "publish" and prepare for the caffeine and sugar crash that will most likely come with the next hour.  P.S. jeff is moving away. And now I am sad about him. I think after he moves is when I will egg his house. Just to be hostile...without causing suspicion. wee. blah.

      It has started. My kind has become the minority. It's crazy to think that when we were kids the whole act was something disgusting- and now it's a growing trend. Or is it? Has sex always been a sport? Is it only NOW that the media has begun shedding light on our bedroom secrets? Sometimes I feel like the only virgin in the entire world. Of course, most of the people in my small group of friends have made it past the touchy feely stage--we are only high schoolers. And of course, my church friends are in the same boat as I am. But what about the others? It seems that a new victim is reeled in everywhere I turn. People that I see as pure, moral beings are really sexing it up with anything of the opposite sex! Is pre-marital sex a fad? Will it fade? Is virgin the new "faux pas"?  About 4 or 5 months ago, my friend, who is 17 years old, had a baby. She gave it to a wonderful, loving family, and visits the little girl about once every month. She has a healthy relationship with the parents, and realizes that she will not always have a part in her daughter's life. I'm glad that everything turned out right for her in the end, but her fairy-tale ending is starting to sugar coat the reason the whole thing happened. She used to be a huge activist for abstinence before she met Mr. "Perfect". But here's the catch: Mr. Perfect wasn't the daddy. She was on rebound guy then- and she paid the price. It makes me think that people should start watching out for themselves. There are so many more people that I know of that SHOULD be pregnant. Some of them have been with the whole damn school. I vaguely remember talking to a senior once who proudly proclaimed that she was a born again virgin.....because she hadn't had sex in six months. I'm pretty sure my jaw dropped to the floor then. What happened to being a first time virgin? When did people get to be "born again virgins"? How can you take back an act like sex?  After I get over the initial shock of hearing about people's sex lives, I eventually start to think if it is less Christian to judge these people for what they have done, or to actually engage in the act of pre-marital sex. Now, I don't stop being friends with people that have sex. I'm not that shallow. But a part of me does lose a bit of respect for them. Sometimes I see sex as a loss of control, or people giving into temptation. Sure, I've gone shopping and come home with a few too many shoes than I should've gotten- but is it the same thing? Sex has become such a regular act in society that becoming pregnant is actually a bad thing! Since when did giving birth to a beautiful baby that you created become a curse? How would you feel if your mother had bookmarked abortion information online when she found out she was carrying you? How would you feel if she had cried when she saw the results? How would you feel if she had considered horrible things to rid herself of you? A child is NOT a curse! But every television show these days has the infamous "I think I might be pregnant" line. There is always the scared look from the possible father, the crying possible mother, and the angry possible grandparents. Then you have to wait a week to find out the results, and if she's not there are always tears of joy and the line "I would have supported you no matter what". I find this disgusting. This proves that people should THINK before they ACT.  But then I have to consider something else. Am I a virgin because I know it is logically the right way to be? Am I a virgin because I can't get any? Am I a virgin because it is "Un-Christian-like" (as people may say)? Or am I a virgin because sex scares the living hell out of me? I think it might be all of them. When I sit and actually consider the pros and cons of having sex before marriage (specifically at this AGE), I am hit with a research paper of cons and a few sentences of pros. Hell, I don't even think the pros made sentence status. I guess that the biggest reason that I am a virgin is that intimacy is a very scary thing. I am very set on finding Mr. Right, and I don't intend on wasting my time on people who I know will only be losers. I would hate to remember my first intimate moment with "some guy in algebra class". The worst would be not even remembering the first. I guess that is just my way of thinking. I have barely been to make out time yet, let alone sexual acts. (and I am not under any circumstances sticking a dick in my mouth). Most people call me a prude, and  I think "Fuck, I'm a prude". But I guess that instead I should be thinking "yes, I'm prude, and that's why I don't have a fucking baby living in me when I'm only 16." and never say it outloud.  So, in this time of ever-growing sexual acceptance, I remain part of a dwindling crowd known as the virgin club. No, we don't hold meetings or have fundraising events- although I'm thinking we should. We don't support DARE or sex-ed. We just sit at home watching Sex and the City and thinking "I wish it was my life... without the sex" And we remain abstinent and happy...for the meantime.  I will be sure to update if my virgin status changes....but I doubt it will.  Happy thoughts.

      I realize how much I love to read sarcastic entries from people who really don't give a shit about what people think than my own whiny soliloquies (spelling?) that are only read by an occasional (and unfortunate) passer-by.  Therefore, for future reference, if I choose to whine or bitch about how my upper middle class life has led me to the deepest caverns of "emo-ism" and that being white has officially made me oppressed at my black majority school, I will add a disclaimer.  On a quite different note, after the occurance of my senior pictures which will exploit me as a 17 year old "wannabe prostitue" in black and white, I think I will die my hair. And not platinum like I did last time. I am thinking....brown? No black, though. That would throw me into the final pit of disgusting emo/punk kid and I would heave my lunch on myself.  Thank you very much! And, to Omaha folk, don't you fucking miss Cursive at Sokol Aud. on August 16th. Only a bastard rents pay per view while a Cursive show is happening.  ...and yes, I do know that my first two paragraphs were one sentence each, but this isn't fucking english class....
