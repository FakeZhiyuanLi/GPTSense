      its funny how im feeling right now, when i was getting really excited about my baptism a week ago but yet im having neutral feelings about it as if it's not a big deal though it really means a lot to me.   (2 Corinthians 5:17.)    "Because I am 'in Christ,' I am a new creation. Old things have passed away. All things have become new."  Christ came to open the prison doors and set the captives free. The prison is open! Whom the Son sets free is free indeed.    this is something i've been waiting for...the moment when i'll be dead to my sins & starting life anew, both literally & physically after the baptism. at times i wonder if im able to do a good job in shining for God cuz it's definately not easy being a Christian & living a life that's more than being just a mediocre Christian...everything we say & do really counts & it's so easy to ruin the image of God by making a wrong move. but thank God for the strength & grace that He'll provide for his children who seek His help.  lately, i've been praying about the loan thingy & i realised that the anger doesn't really exist anymore even though i dwell on it at times. i saw him online & i just told him no matter what happens, he's still a friend of mine & i'll never forget the times he stood by me in the past. he probably has his reasons for avoiding me or something & i shouldn't be so quick to condemn this friendship or him..on the contrary, i ought to feel happy that i was able to help him when he's really in need of help & this is probably a lesson for me in learning to be generous & not focus too much on the material possessions of this earth. i thank God for showing me this & for helping me to be wiser in my finances...i still want to be of some help financially to friends in need (not that im very loaded of cos) but this time i have to see if it's really for a good cause & need before i do it, otherwise even if i can't get the $ back, at least i know what i've really done with the $ so it's given out without regrets.  many times we learnt the hard lessons only after we commit the mistakes which are irreversible...i keep thinking about them lately & i told myself to fully let the past go when i get baptised tomorrow. stuff about my past r/s & how i lived my life back then before knowing Christ, esp the times when i was backsliding...if it weren't for Shawna who never gave up in asking me back to Christ, i think i'll still be living a meaningless life, repeating the same mistakes which will only lead to a dead end. Cheryl said this:  "It truly is a step further into the supernatural, into a realm of greater anointing... and God will use you in mighty ways, in ways you can't even imagine.  You'll be empowered to walk this earth and this life with assurance, with authority, with confidence, and with a kind of faith that overcomes the world!  So congrats again - your life will never be the same."  This is really an encouragement for me & i know that wanting to get baptised is the wisest decision that i made in this lifetime...i want to live a different life for sure & this time it can't be just all talk & no actions taken...but i know i'll rely greatly on God for his support to be just like Jesus...overcoming whatever persecutions that come my way, etc...  tomorrow will be the most exciting day of my life & i know that LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN!!   Psalm 9:1-2   O Lord, I will praise you with all my heart and tell everyone about the marvelous things you do. I will be glad, yes, filled with joy because of you. I will sing your praises, O Lord God above all gods.

      today is a day where i'll feel deep regrets for not cherishing my dad when he's still alive...for not being able to reach out to him back then when i was already a Christian...for not being able to do him proud...& most of all, not being able to show him how much i love & appreciate everything that he's done for me in my life. but today when i went to pay respects to him, i just told him that i'll do him proud & take good care of my family...i really wish that i can get to know how he's doing somehow but i don't know how God will answer this question of mine.  i had a wonderful time fellowshipping with Wen after going for a water baptism class in the noon. im very excited abt my baptism this sun because i wanna be dead to my sins & really start life anew. i don't wish to be tied to my old self anymore & i just wanna re-dedicate my life to God, not committing my former sins & suffer the condemnation of my sister. it's pathetic being condemn by someone who's really close to you just because of something that you did which isn't even related to her. People are just so quick to judge, criticise & condemn but who cares about what others want to say as long as your conscience is clear & most importantly,  we have redemption through Jesus' blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the richness of His grace .  (Ep 1:7)   Praise God!

      i went to sign the appointment letter today & i'm looking forward to the new office on the 14th July. i met up with one of the directors & she seemed like a nice lady but i was still nervous during the 2nd interview & thank God i got the job since i've already tendered yesterday.  i went to spend my last 50 bucks on my hair, went to trim cuz it's getting really messy & seems like i really need to dump the shampoo that i got for rebonding the other time because it wasn't suitable for me so i had to get a proper shampoo before my hair gets worse.  anyway, i knew being broke would be the outcome but it's reali something foolish cuz now i gotta worry about how im going to survive till my next pay day which doesn't come till the following week. tried to get some $ back from a frd who owes my mum $$ for the past few mths already, but of no avail. sometimes i wonder why i got my mum into this just because i found it hard to reject him when he asked for help & it's not just $100 or so...mum doesn't mind since she knows him but i just feel that he should have just give some form of assurance that he's unable to pay us back but will try to work things out slowly or something...nothing at all. i think i really have to do what i joked when i told him that i'd talk to my mum about it - pay on his behalf if he ever fails to return her the $ & starts avoiding me like a plague or something. i still trust him a lot & i do understand his difficulty in returning the lump sum at one shot but the only thing i wanted was a response somehow & yet it's so difficult.  when i thought about how he stood by me during the worst times of my life when i had no one to turn to..even when i needed the $, i don't even dare to ask my family or friends for help..i felt that i shouldn't press him for the $, but i had to be accountable to my mum since i was the one who asked her for help.    If we want to truly know the Lord, we need to choose to be where He would be, think what He would think, go where He would go, treat people the way He would treat people.    Matthew 5:42 "Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you"   *sigh* what can we say when God already says this about helping others? but of cos, helping others must come from the heart. i felt happy about helping him...prolly with the new blessings from God (abt wk), i can pay off his debts to my mum without her knowing for the time being & place everything into God's hands rather than feeling angry or disappointed with my friend because he could really worse off than i thought. anyway God's timing & ways of handling circumstances & people is perfect & miraculous.   The bangkok trip couldn't have come any sooner/later cuz i can enjoy this break before i start the new job since i won't have time to rest after my last day. really must enjoy myself though my initial purpose was to protect my mum since i felt it's unsafe for her to go there with her gf & son who's still young...though i'm unable to really protect her, but at least i feel better being by her side. will definately be praying hard for our safety too cuz there isn't any man with us...*sigh* now i realised the importance of my dad who could provide us the security that we needed...but thank God He'll always be with us as well.   Thank God for everything that He's planned out for us...You're truly awesome & amazing! Luv ya lots!!!!

      14 June 2004 (Monday @ 1:20pm)  i received a call from a job agency early this morning...regarding abt an interview that i went on 9th June. it caught me by surprise because i had 2nd thoughts abt wanting that job aft the interview since they weren't paying me what i had expected & basically i was feeling unsure about the job though i felt it would be a new experience trying out a slightly different scope of work over there. besides, i get to dress casually (haha, this is something i really hope for since i don't really like wearing office wear all the time) if i want to & i can save up on my transport if i manage to catch the buses on time.  when my agent called me and told me that im being offered for the job, the first thing that came to my mind was 'oh no..don't tell me im being offered that position, how am i going to reject it'...but before i could speak, she told me that the company is going to hire me at a higher position" & they're giving me what i had initially stated for my salary expectations...which is $300 more than what was offered to me the first time!  It may not be that much to many people but considering what i've been getting for my past job, esp this current one that im wkg, it's a major leap!  what's more is the initial 7 days leave that they offered is increased to 10 days.  Praise the Lord!!!  God really gave me such a sweet surprise, esp when i was wondering how i could start saving up for pre-sch teaching courses & helping my mum out with the household expenses. finances is really tight & i needed more...i couldn't believe how i could survive on a pathetic amount of less than $800 per mth for the past 5 mths but God has been blessing me all these while.  i really believe in open-heaven if one gives tithe to the Lord because i gave last mth (out of faith since i only kept abt $50 to last me a couple of wks before i get my next pay) but im already broke to give this month & God is still gracious enough to bless me! of course i needed to set aside the 10% beforehand and not later (sorry Father =p) but i'll make it a point to do that in future! i know Satan will try to tempt me in keeping the 10% for other usages, mostly to satisfy my carnal desires but i'll pray hard for God's help in resisting those temptations and being obedient to Him. Can't wait to share the news with my fellow bros & sis during CG this sat & telling my mum abt it after work too!!  Praises to you God, our Heavenly Father forever!!!

       13 June 2004 (Sunday @ 1:16pm)   i was happy yesterday because mum got a digicam which i really loved until i decided to buy it from her instead..don't want her to spend so much $ on me anymore & i can't wait to use it, esp during the CG's BBQ this coming Sat!  After the 'shopping' trip, i went to meet Wal to attend a BBQ with his ex-campmates & it turned out to be really 'happening' though i don't really the people there but they're very friendly & definately wild! watching the guys drink & play in the pool was so hilarious & scary...thank God they didn't drag us gals into the pool. saw this guy whom Wal said he looks like Shrek & haha, really man! he's cute & funny...never imagined him to really look so alike in person! should have taken a pic of him...but maybe another time when Kenny holds another BBQ at his place again. hope Wal is able to join me for this sat's BBQ...it's not easy asking him to church man...haha, but he knows that i'll continue to bug him for sure! he's unlucky to call me his princess =p...   Growing up spiritually is painful to the flesh but freedom to the spirit. Remaining a child spiritually is painful to the spirit but freedom to our flesh. In each case, there is pain. One is pain to death; the other is pain unto life.  how true this is...

       11 June 2004 (10:32am)   it's a great friday morning today...warm sunny day though i heard on the radio that some parts of the world is experiencing some freaky weather these days. earlier on, the skies were so cloudy that threatened to rain in some parts of the country as well but now it has cleared. Praise God!   last night, we had CG outing where we had dinner at Sakae Sushi & a few of us went to watch 'day after tomorrow' which was a really good show despite the not-so-nice reviews that i had from a few friends who had already watched the show. anyway, i had loads of fun during the dinner because a few of us kept fooling ard with our handphones & cameras...took some funny videos & pix that cracked everyone up & it's really hilarious! for the first time (ain't kidding abt that), i even look okay when i was using my hp to take pix of me & wen...haha...turned out nicer than i thought & considering the countless times i've tried taking pix of myself with the hp, it's like 1/20 chance that my pic would turn out ok enough to save or share it with others. moreover the pic that i took with Wen was nice & tks to Serene who helped us take a pic when she saw how awkward we were from trying to take pix on our own. anyway, we had a great time eating & fellowshipping with one another & now i'm looking forward to our combined CG next sat where we'll be having a BBQ after our CG. Yippee!~  Hmm...the movie kinda taught us not to neglect the environment & to really take care of it because we are the ones living on earth & there's already so much corruption & damage that's being done to the environment that someday such drastic changes to the climate could very well become a reality. when Angeline remarked about the promise that the father had given to his son in the movie about saving him, it convicts us that our Heavenly Father is true to His promises too & He'll never let us down.   lately i felt that love (esp in regards to BGR) is really complex & i doubt if it's really possible for a couple to be together forever. i never really believe in eternity but after knowing the guys from my CG, i felt that God is really able to create Godly Men who are different from the mediocre guys that i used to know. hearing how my bros & sis-in-Christ share their wonderful & funny love stories makes me yearn for such a r/s which i firmly believe that's possible thru God's grace & love. i really want to thank Him for changing my mindset in expecting what i want & not settling for less so i won't be giving myself another chance in entering a wrong r/s which will only turn out to be futile. a person who claims how much he loves you is able to find a new lover certainly proved how much that his love was worth afterall. probably it's just sour grapes that i'm tasting but i know it's a blessing in disguise & it only taught me not to believe in everything that a guy says because few people actually mean what they say anyway...same goes to me but God has taught me to honor my words because God honors His Words & likewise we as Christians oughta do the same.  found this from a website (Crosswalk.com), thought it'll be encouraging to whoever is reading this too since most of us would have this desire to see our loved ones being saved...   You should, of course, desire that your loved ones come to Christ, and pray and work to that end. Your goal is to be a positive witness by becoming the spouse or parent God has called you to be. Then you must  leave the results to God . Assuming responsibility for the salvation of your loved ones is beyond your ability. Every loved one can choose not to respond to Christ. Depression often signals that you are desperately clinging to a goal you have little or no chance of achieving, and that's not a healthy goal.    Something that i need to bear in mind as well:    Every commandment of God comes with a promise: "For as many as may be the promises of God, in Him they are yes" (2 Corinthians 1:20). God will never command us to do something that He will not empower us to do. It is never a question of whether God can, but if He wills. If He wills, then we can, if we believe. Those predisposed to do His will understand what it is (John 7:17), and by the grace of God will do it.    It is critical to realize that God is under no obligation to man . God is only under obligation to Himself and to the covenants He has made with us. We don't need God jumping around in heaven catering to our every whim! There will never be a day when we say something and God has to do it because we said it. We cannot box God in.

       9 June 2004   i felt a tinge of jealousy & heartache when i heard that "he" has found a new gf although he's not putting in a 100% as compared to the past when he's with me. but thank God i prayed hard & asked God to remove such feelings & to really break my emotional bondage that i had with "him" & my past bfs; to be really happy for him; to be released from my past hurts & unhappy memories that'd haunt me from time to time.   God is a good God & I feel peaceful now. Praise the Lord for his grace & mercy. i can feel the change in me, when i have to admit that i can be someone who'd be easily tempted to enter a r/s if i find some guy who's really nice & that we could click, but as my walk with God continues, my mentality has changed & i no longer focus so much on my love life because i've been busy with thinking about God & my family. during this time, of course, i'll be praying that God will continue to mould & refine me & my other half so we'll compliment each other when it's finally time for us to meet & haha, it's really something exciting that i'm looking forward to cuz i can finally say GOODBYE to all my failed experiences in past r/s & start a new life that'll last me for the rest of my life.   Luke 22:42 Lord, i've not always understood what plan you have for me; yet i will glory in Your cross and bear mine patiently  thank Wen for this verse cuz she knows what im going thru...still confused about my career but God is really blessing me thru her & gosh...i really feel so touched & thankful to God for his blessings thru my church family. i guess im beginning to understand & experience this period of time as the moulding of my life before i live life to the fullest which is like what Wen felt - could be reali difficult & miserable at times, but nevertheless i'll listen to Wen's advice & teachings...to ask God to reveal what He's teaching me in every lesson of life.  This verse couldn't have come more timely for me...thought I'd share with anyone who's reading this..hehe  And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace..., Who has called you to His [own] eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will Himself complete and make you what you ought to be, establish and ground you securely, and strengthen, and settle you. ???1 Peter 5:10

       8 June 2004   suddenly i felt so negative about life & work, like im still living in a clueless world while trying my best to find out my potential. i only know i like to sing (can't possibly join Singapore Idol cuz I'll flunk the audition!), enjoys being with kids, studying foreign languages or being with people. i do hope to take up a cert/diploma in pre-sch teaching but it's so damn expensive! God knows when i'll be able to save up that amount of money to study...-_-| Though i've heard that the pay isn't very good, i guess if I really enjoy doing something, i'd even do it for free, like what Cheryl & the gals were discussing during our "Women's Fellowship". anyway, regarding about my 'career', i'll just pray hard for open doors & that i'll discover what i really want in life because i'm getting impatient about it but i know that i have to be patient no matter what. *sigh*  i was thinking abt my family & how i had been wkg at CNBC all these while & i felt that i didn't really contribute much to the company even though i helped Shirley lighten her load at times...& i really want to glorify God in everything i do/say but i learnt that even the smallest thing can bring Him glory if we do it with the right attitude. that helped me to disperse the negative emotions that i felt today & i was a crybaby because of that...(of cos i let it all out in the ladies *blush*) whenever i wonder why i was willing to stay there when all i get was really pathetic pay (when i was temping for 4 mths) but i finally knew it when Shirley shared with me about her persecution & by God's grace, i always found stuff to encourage her...God is really so awesome & amazing since He connected her, Joanne & I together which is totally unbelievable & too much of a coincidence...Temping with Joanne at Designbridge before meeting Shirley at CNBC & finding out that Joanne used to be from CNBC & that she shared about Christ with Shirley before she switched jobs. Moreoever, Joanne & i used to work at Hitachi though it's two different places...i think God placed me there to encourage Shirley & she feels the same way too. God IS SOOOOO GOOD!  anyway, when my mind was filled up with negative thoughts this afternoon, this quote that i heard from church "it's not what i think i am, but what God has made me to be..." suddenly came to my mind & wow, that really dispels every negative thought because i know God had not created me to be so negative & useless! Ditto to everyone out there~ Praises to God forever!!!

       7 June 2004   just got back from ktv with Wen & her friends...annie & alvin & reali nice peeps & she intro-ed Lance, who in turn, intro-ed Deyuan to us...we had fun singing & since it's our 'evangelism ktv', i was telling her that i'm trying to ask my cousin along in future since she enjoys singing too.   as usual, we chatted abt God & we were discussing about the promptings from the Holy Spirit & i just realised that i've gotten promptings but i ignored them, thinking that it could be a joke from Satan at times, or just my own thots...dis just shows how 'strong' i am with the Lord -_-|| still has A LOT to learn in my walk with Him, esp in reading His Word.  gosh, i'm so tired but yet happy that tml i'll be having lunch with a frd whom i've been waiting sooo long to hv lunch with since the day he started wkg near my office. i'm also looking forward to the CG outing dis thur, frd's bbq on Sat (so i can continue to reach out to him), church svc on sun...combined CG next sat, etc..machiem i'm so busy like that.   anyway, i gotta log off now...sis is gonna scream at me if i use the net for too long..

       6 June 2004   i dono how many times i've taken the holy communion but today when Pastor Tan was telling us to quiet down & really think about connecting ourselves wif Jesus before we partake the communion, i felt different & in a way, really 'connected' wif Christ. it felt good & i guess i recalled some scenes from the movie "passion of the Christ" that made me felt like i really want to be even closer to God.   Pastor Kong was sharing the good news wif us - more than 100,000 souls being added to the Kingdom of God in 7 mths & 1 wk & its reali awesome! im reali proud to be in this church...& i hope to join in the mission team sometime wif Wen too...she wants to sing & i believe that it'll come to past if God calls her to do that...for me, im still figuring out what's my purpose...hope i figure that out ASAP then life will be soooo much more fulfilling.

       5 June 2004    I went for the Hillsongs conference wif Wen yesterday & it was great! we were there earlier becos we didn't know if there'll be a big crowd but amazing things happened. God's presence was reali strong & that refreshed us deeply. We didn't know if all the entrances will be opened but Wen felt that we should be seating at the EAST entrance & we managed to be the first in line & the amazing thing is that there were quite a few people siting in the north entrance & it seems that during the last conference, only 1 entrance was opened & that's the NORTH but when we went there yesterday, they opened the EAST as well. Nevertheless, we got great seats that was really near to the stage, even Wen's frds who joined us later felt that the seats were really good! ^^ Praise God!  I really wanna thank God for showing me more of his awesome goodness & from fellowshipping wif fellow members of the church, I really got to know the Lord more & my love for Him increases each day. One of my greatest desire is to see my loved ones saved...my family & friends...& the past few times when I get to listen to sermons preached during CG & Church, they touched on that & I really believe that my prayers will be answered. Bro Jeremy emphasized that we're living in the Matthew 24 times & it convicts me to really go out to 'compel' family/friends to know the Lord & be committed to him. I really want all of us to go to Heaven & we'll always be with our Heavenly Father...no more sickness, tears, negative emotions, etc...what more can we ask for?!?  Though I really, really have a lot to learn & grow in my walk with God, it's really exciting & adventurous like what Pastor Kong always says...though it may be hard at times since it's NEVER easy being a Christian, but with the Holy Spirit going thru everything with us, we can overcome all obstacles!!      I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.   Thank God for everything that He's doing...

      Things don't seem to go that smooth at work today though i thot it'll be a breeze...even if it's just getting some passports for collection or employment matters. I was waiting for my CEO's passports (supposed to be collected by his secretary but she's busy, so I gotta do it) & it may be an easy task but I donno y I felt afraid to do it. I don't really get to talk to my CEO but his voice is loud enuf to announce his presence whenever he's ard & prolly that gave me an impression that he's quite intimidating.  Nevertheless, I did what I had to do & while I was trying to calm myself down after that brief encounter cuz it wasn't exactly smooth, I realised that it's not right of me to feel such strong fear for anyone esp because the only Being that I oughta have fear for is God & yet I seem to be more afraid of Man than Him.  Such irony that I think I oughta be shot for not knowing whom I should fear more!  Shouldn't really be taking God for granted all these while, looking for Him when I'm really in trouble or anything & neglecting Him when things are smooth. I pray that I'll be totally dependent on Him & will not take things into my own hands that will disrupt His plans for me..but praise the Lord for helping me to grow & to know Him better during my walk with Him..He's really awesome & great!  Woo~hoo! Went to look for the CEO again cuz he forgot his impt card that's needed for collection of his new pass...was very surprised that he apologised for the problem that he gave! But thank God it went smoothly...*phew* Went shopping wif sis during lunch & spent quite a bomb...haha, but its a gd way of de-stressing, muz control my expenditure somehow, otherwise I won't have enuf to last me for the rest of the mth.  Another few hrs & I'll be meeting the 'gang' for dinner before heading for Kebin's house for CG. Feeling excited abt it because I'm wondering what will be the message for this wk...it's amazing how God changes our hearts & minds...to think I used to detest attending CG but now it's different. I really enjoy fellowshiping with fellow members cuz I get to know more abt God at the same time. ^^

      Went to visit grandparents aft paying respects to dad in the morning...spend the day playing/blading with my lil' cuzzies which was pretty fun. when my cousin, Carol, came home from her shopping in the evening, she recommended my sis, Aunt & I a facial mask that's made from real strawberries & wow, it smells soooo yummy! Nana & I even went to get one each on our way home cuz we're so vain...but I guess gals are like that. Haha  The 4 of us then started to put on masks & it was like a mini-beauty parlor in her room...quite funny & definately gal-bonding! Sometime I reali hope that they could be saved so all of us can be in heaven when Christ comes back...I can't imagine how it's like if we're separated, considering they're my loved ones & this gives me the motivation to start reaching out to them.  Sometimes the people closest to you seems to be the hardest people to reach out to, but I pray that God will help me to do the impossible. God says that one who's saved in a household, the rest of the household will be saved too...I'm reali holding on to that word but I guess prayer itself won't work w/o works.  Reali thankful to God for his wonderful love & grace..esp when I feel that I've not been fulfilling my promises to God, esp in devoting at least an hr to Him everyday. Though I try to do everything with an attitude that would bring Him glory, I feel that it's not enough w/o reading the Word & spending quiet time with Him. Reali must learn to crucify the flesh that tempts me from disobeying God man...*sigh*

      It's been a week since I've been working here. Though I've been complaining in the past few days, I realised that I've really been blessed when I made it a point to pray for better attitude towards my work & everything. Though I have to lunch alone, I get to spend the time alone with God at the penthouse (which Wendy & Cindee thought it's really a nice place) & I've taken time to really count my blessings ever since I got this job. My colleagues are pretty nice to me; workload's not as bad as I thought - probably because I've given myself unnecessary pressure; I get to read free mags which saves me alot of money; having the chance to meet up with my mum for dinner after work is also something I should be thankful for. I felt bad about being stressed out at work that I vent my frustrations on her at times but praise God for helping me change...I hardly dread waking up for work these days too. Hallelujah!  Yesterday we had Zone Meeting with Pastor Derek in church, and time was getting late...I wasn't really enjoying the CG & my attitude got the worst of me. I don't know why I got really distracted yesterday, alot of things were running in my mind. When Pastor Derek was busy praying & laying hands on certain groups of people, I felt so bitter & couldn't wait to go home since I didn't want to spend a bomb on the cab fare later (already broke so I don't know how I'm even gonna get home if it's past 12am)...Pastor Derek was really anointed & the glory of God was really strong on him...he went around praying & trying to fill us up with the Holy Spirit. Wendy and Serene even went 'down' from the power though I felt nothing...maybe it's really my rebellious attitude & bitterness that kept my heart hardened. I was quite nervous when Pastor Derek turned to me, even worse when he wanted to pray for me, but I just gave my all to God, hoping that He can change my attitude. I was really waiting in anticipation, wondering what God would say to me...I couldn't really remember what Pastor Derek said except that he could sense that I have a lot of stuff on my mind - family, relationships & God wants me to let them go...that He's never forgotten about me...& I was prayed to be healed, probably emotionally or physically...the presence was really strong & I felt kinda groggy but it's awesome that when I got up, my burden was really gone. I felt alert, with a new sense of joy & everything was lifted off me.  Matthew 11:30 - "For my yoke fits perfectly, & the burden I give you is light."  I'm really thankful to Pastor Derek since it's not often that we can get prayed & laid hands on. Felicia, Cindee & Wendy said I'm really blessed...Wendy was prayed for as well & I guess last night's meeting really stirred us up...can't wait for every chance to get to church or CG.  Sometimes I feel that the change in me, about how I view God and everything has changed drastically but I love it & I know it's for the better. Wal said I've became a hard-core Christian & actually I'm proud of it! Lolz...I'm really proud to be a Christian, a member of City Harvest Church & having an intimate relationship with God who's really, really wonderful & indescribable at times. I know for sure is that I'll never get enough of God...I pray that all Christians will press on for that & continue to be on fire to do His works on earth till Jesus returns again!

      I've been feeling miserable ever since I started work in my new job. Initially things were fine until I realised, apart from the heavy workload that makes me feel bad about myself - not being able to understand what shipping line is all about and having to juggle between this & recep work is also messy enough! This company can be too disorganised at times & it only makes working here worse. I told God to reveal the purpose why I'm here & I've learnt that at times, having a higher pay (slightly only) isn't the main reason to job-hop but of course this isn't the only reason why I'm here...  Anyway, I guess I oughta feel comforted when this verses kept running before my eyes:  Deut 31:8 - The Lord himself will go before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you.  Isaiah 41:10 - (The Lord says) "Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed; for I am your God. I will strengthen you & help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."  Wow, that's really something to hold on to. Two months may seem really long to me right now, but there's nothing much I can do except to try my best to adapt & learn whatever I can from this job.   Sometimes it's just ironic when the similar scriptures or even a name just flashes across your eyes often when you least expect it...*secret between me & my Heavenly Father*...show me what "that" means yah?? But in the meantime, help me so I will not be distracted from keeping You in my mind & heart always...Thank you Jesus, for EVERYTHING!

      It's only my 2nd day and at times i almost thought i wanna give up because there's simple too much things for me to remember and handle. but i told myself that since God opened this door for me, and that He'll always be with me, i need not fear or be discouraged. somehow things got better...esp my mood & attitude...anyway i told myself that no matter what, i want to do things to glorify God so i can't give up or give in to such negative thoughts & emotions.  Saw this online today from joyce meyer's website...this is coincidence or what? But it certainly got me into having the right perspective from God. Praise God!  July 15, 2004      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Failure or victory is conceived in our thinking first then birthed in our lives.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An attitude is a way of life formed by negative or positive decisions made in the midst of circumstances we are experiencing or have experienced. ? Hebrews 4:12     Come to think of it, i'm already quite blessed since my colleagues (those whom I get in contact with most regularly) are quite friendly...gotta see how things goes somehow. Ever since i started working 4 years ago, i got to know alot of nice people but i never really thanked the Lord for His constant care & love thru these people...though i was still a backslider back then...but it's really obvious that His presence is with me when i'm closer to Him now.  Just hope to continue to shine for Him and share the Good News with the unsaved whenever i have the chance! Things will be much easier with the bible studies from Pastor Kong's seminar. woohoo~

      I went for the Overnight prayer meeting at church on Thur with Wendy & spent the night over at her place which was quite fun...as if it was a slumber party...we didn't sleep till 4am after reaching back at her place only around 2.30am cuz we chatted about God & I was sharing with her about how blessed I am lately, because God has really been answering my prayers & thoughts. She feels happy for me as well because she also felt that God has been good to me (and to all His children of cos). The both of us concluded that if we haven't got to know Jesus, God knows how depressed & lost we'll end up feeling for the rest of our lives.  I also went to check out our Children's Church on Sat & I had a lot of fun playing with Joey n this little boy, Gerald on the bus. Seeing the kids enjoying themselves while singing & praising God really touched me. They were so serious when it came to worship & the presence of God was strong as well though I was more like a spectator there & I didn't really joined in the singing & stuff. =p I'm still considering taking up this ministry but seems torn between this & a few other ministries...*sigh*  Anywayz, I was praying & trying to listen to God speak to me by staying still on Tue (6 July 2004) & for the first time, I heard God speak to me. Though it's not an audible voice, I felt the words deep in my heart & it's really amazing. God said "You are healed. Trust Me" when I was confessing about my prayers in wanting to be healed as well as pouring out all my doubts about my life & even in Him. This encounter strengthened my faith in God & I can practically feel myself growing in the Lord. Praise God!  Another thing to be really happy about is praying for C.W to get a job soon. He was sharing about a particular job that he's interested in & after I've been sharing Shawna's & my own testimonies, he told me to pray for him. I told him to pray for himself too & when he said he'll try, I felt happy for him since he's willing to make the first step as well. Though he was kidding about praying for 4D numbers when I shared about how God answered prayers, I told him that God will only meet our needs & not our greed, so not every prayers will be answered unless it's really best for us to let us have what we've been praying for. A few days later, I checked with him about how his job search is coming along & he said he's gotten that job that he's interested in & he's even starting work this Friday! Hallelujah! God is really full of surprises Hehe...  Church is focusing on winning souls for the Lord & it stirs up the spirit in most of CHC members...really hope to go all out to win the souls of the unsaved out there & the seminar I attended yesterday is really great. I'm so proud of being in City Harvest & having such wonderful pastors & leaders despite the negative remarks about my church at times. After backsliding for about 6 yrs, I still feel that CHC's the best!  We'll be having many events lining up till Aug & I can't wait for Hillsongs United to lead the Praise & Worship in my church sometime next month (if I remembered correctly). Boy! Are we in for a super treat!  Best Defence against the Forces of Satan -->  1 John 4:4    You are from God, little children, and have overcome [evil spirits]; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world

      Seems like God is really trying to make me learn from the 'loan' experience & the mentality to treat everybody, esp those who've hurt me or vice versa.  Went to check on today's daily devotion from Joyce Meyer's website & I got *hit*.   Blessed Are the Merciful      ?Matthew 5:7 KJV    Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.   Being merciful can be defined as giving good that is undeserved. Anyone can give people what they deserve. It takes someone full of Jesus to give good to people when they do not deserve it.  Revenge says, "You mistreated me, so I'm going to mistreat you." Mercy says, "You mistreated me, so I'm going to forgive you, restore you, and treat you as if you never hurt me." What a blessing to be able to give and receive mercy.  To be merciful is to see "the why behind the what." In other words, mercy doesn't just look at what a person does, but seeks to understand why he did what he did.  Being merciful does not mean we don't deal with issues. It means we have a forgiving, understanding attitude while we deal with them.  God is merciful to us, and He is giving us a chance to be blessed by giving mercy to others.  Do you ever need God or man to show you mercy? Of course, we all do on a regular basis. The best way to get mercy is to be busy giving it away.  Give judgment, and you will receive judgment. Give mercy, and you will receive mercy.  Remember, you reap what you sow. Be merciful! Be blessed!    Got is truly speaking & knows what's going on in the hearts & minds of everyone...esp to His beloved children! Thank you Father!

      I finally got baptised last Sun & though things didn't turn out as supernaturally as I had imagined, I still felt great & joyful after the baptism. I'm really thankful & touched by the support of my fellow CG members who stood in the sun throughout the baptism ceremony & it's certainly a day to remember for the 4 of us who got baptised together. I felt like a star because we had to take many pix together & it's really sweet that everyone felt excited & extremely happy for one another, esp the baptised candidates.  I'm very happy that I really feel close to God & the sense of peace & joy knowing that He's always here with me is stronger than before. Making the decision to commit myself & my time to God is really cool & it seems like I can never get enough of God. I'm really thankful for the change in my attitude & mentality towards God, for changing me from someone who would avoid attending CG to someone who'd be looking forward to CG every week. I'm so blessed with great leader & CG members whom I've gotten so attached to. Life is definately much more exciting & meaningful with Christ.  A few days ago when I was still worrying about the problem about the loan that my mum gave to my friend, I couldn't even sleep well without dreaming about it. I kept asking God to guide & teach me in dealing with it & WHY this is happening when I never expected a really good friend whom I trusted so much to treat me this way. I'm trying really hard to forgive & forget and though I feel that I've forgiven him, I still couldn't forget it.   Yesterday I saw this from Joyce Meyer's website: Let God Be God of the Future  Jeremiah 29:11   For I know the thoughts & plans that I have for you, says the Lord, thoughts & plans for welfare & peace & not for evil, to give you hope in your final outcome.    Isaiah 55:8   God's thoughts are not our thoughts, & His ways are not our ways. We want what feels good right now, but God has something far greater in mind.   We are constantly trying to figure out something we do not understand or trying to make something happen now that is not happening yet. It seems as if we are always trying, but  believers are supposed to believe!   "Why, God, Why?" and "When, God, When?" can be two statements that keep us frustrated & prevent us from enjoying peace. Many times we do not understand what God is doing. But this is what trust is all about. Let God be God in your life. Give Him the reins. He knows what He's doing.   Trust yourself & everything to God who judges fairly & deals righteously. Deposit yourself in His hands & watch what He can do!   Wow...Amen to that! After what Bro Jeremy preached during CG last night made me felt even convicted about trusting God in the impossible.   Came across this earlier on:  Whether our dispute is a personal or a public matter, we quickly reveal whether we possess a servant's heart in how we respond to those who have offended us. We always have a choice. Will we choose to hold on to the things that have hurt us until we've erected monuments of spite that divide our once harmonious relationships . . . or will we choose to create lasting legacies of forgiveness by forgiving those that hurt us and then releasing the offense. . . canceling the debt? Don't miss those final words.we release people from the guilt and no longer hold the offense over their heads. When we choose to "cancel the debt," we unshackle people from the dark emotions lurking in our hearts that say, "Never. Never let this go." In fact, for those who have experienced life-altering offenses, choosing to forgive and release people can be an ongoing process.   When Peter asked Jesus, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven" (Matthew 18:21-22).    Servants must be broad-shouldered people-big enough to go on, big enough to remember the right and forgive the wrong by releasing the offender of any guilt, pain, or grudges.   Knowing what I ought to do now certainly released me from the burden of worry & building up of hatred for this friend. Whatever it is, it's all up in God's hands who will decide what He'll do about this issue. I still believe that somehow God will bless me greatly about how I've handled this after struggling with it for sometime already.  I'm so thankful for being able to look upon God when I'm faced with problems in life & knowing that He goes thru every struggles in life with us.    La 3:24   I say to myself, "The Lord is mine, so I hope in Him"
