      As anounce a few weeks ago, the WKRP audio catalog will re-open under a much more dynamic management structure in September. I did not want to wait until the last minute to open so I spent the last couple nights rebuilding the site and switching out shopping cart codes for all the artists.  The radio show to promote the audio catalog will open in early September as planned but I thought it would be good to have the place back up and running while we wait..  &nbsp; What is left to finish is this:  We will upload 4 song sample for every artist and add them to the section in early September. We are currently waiting for the WKRP site to be switched over before &nbsp;we upload samples.  I will add a pay by check option this week for folks without a credit card.  I will add the link to listen to the radio show next month when it begins streaming.  I will also be adding additional bands as they submit material to us.  We expect to increase many of the non-traditional genres in the future as I have opened the door for Jazz, Hip Hop, Classical, and many other so called sub-genre.  I am very excited about the new leadership at WKRP and I think we all will be glad we sent material in for online distribution.. Let's have a look around and see what has changed at:  http://www.evor.com/wkrp   Bend'em Charlie Harrelson

         How hard is it to get Internet Radio play for your music? How many CD's did you mail out  this year hoping to get added to any stations rotation?  How much trouble is it to set  up online Distribution with the many sites that promise new fans, increased sales and   great customer service?    Today, getting your music into the rotation on Internet Radio is now almost as tuff as   getting your music played on a national Clear Channel Station. Online Distribution is nothing  more then a warehouse that stocks your CD(s) and expects you to sell them so they can collect  1/3 of the retail selling price. Where is the love?    So what can an Independent artist or band do?    They can start by signing up with the WKRP Audio Catalog.   This Online CD Distribution and Streaming Radio Network can provide you  with both Internet radio play and (non-exclusive) online CD distribution.    Because the WKRP Streaming Radio Shows will only feature the music from  the artists that we are selling. You can bet that your music will get on our show   rotations faster then any other Internet Radio promotional vehicle you have ever tried. Our   commitment is to market and sell your CD's because we all win when folks tune in, listen,   then buy music. It's just that simple.     WKRP is now owned by Internet personality James Lowe of KJAG Radio. WKRP Internet  Radio and KJAG Internet Radio have both been streaming taped and live Internet Radio programs  for over 4 years and have built a sizable audience. The WKRP business model will separate   itself from the rest of the Internet Radio Stations and online Distributors because   they will play ONLY music from the artists that it distributes!    WKRP Audio Catalog is a non-exclusive distribution agreement so you are free to list your  CD's with all the top Distribution sites (and we strongly suggest that you do).    The WKRP Audio Catalog one stop Solution: -No more shipping CD's to distribution outlets and additional CD's to Internet Radio Stations.  -If we agree to stock your CD(s), we guarantee your songs will be played on our streaming shows. -Our Distribution agreement allows the artist to keep 75% of the retail selling price! -We also have an EP and Bootleg CD listing so folks willing to test the market can offer   a very low cost CD alternative to your online fans. -We create an audience for your music via our Streaming Radio Shows. -Your CD will be displayed on one of the Internets nicest looking CD distribution pages. -We can offer Interviews with bands to help promote a new release of upcoming show. -We're NOT CLEAR CHANNEL....    The website and Streaming shows open to the general public September 1st 2004 and like the  title of this message said, "Movers and Shakers wanted." It takes about 3 weeks from the time  we get your submission until we have you listed in our CD Catalog so we want only movers and   shakers to get this new promotional vehicle started.   Questions and Answers:   1. Q- How will we know if our music is good enough to be played and distributed by WKRP?    A- Simple, is your instrument in tune? Can your singer carry a tune? You know if you stink. 2. Q- What do the CD's retail for and how much does the artist make per sale?    A- To keep it simple right now, we are offering every CD for 12.00     (plus shipping and handling and we promise not to handle them much). The artist keeps    75% of the retail price or $8.00. 3. Q- How often will the artist get paid on CD sales?    A- Unless a band is moving huge volumes of CD's we will settle up once every 3 months. 4. Q- How many CD's should we ship?    A- We like to start off with at least 10 CD's, more if you plan to do additional promotions    with us. 5. Q- Do I need to sign a royalty waiver to get my music played on your shows?    A- Yes, and a waiver is printable at: http://www.evor.com/wkrp/waiver.html    This waiver needs to be filled out and mailed along with your CDs for consignment sales. 6. Q- Should we also provide a press kit with photos, Bio's, website info and reviews?    A- Can a horse - well, you know the answer..Of course, you need to send this with your submission. 7. Q- You mentioned EP's and Bootlegs offerings. Can you explain what this means?    A- Not every artist has a full length CD ready for marketing. Some may have a quality 3-4     song offering and a $12. retail price is simply too much. We will offer an $8.00 bootleg     or EP offering so artists can test the waters while working on a new CD. 8. Q- How many bands will be distributed?    A- This will depend totally on the amount of people that respond. We currently have 45 artists    ready to go now and expect to have over 100 when we launch in September. Our future growth will     depend totally on our success.  9. Q- How do I sign up?    A- Thought you would never ask!    The WKRP Audio Catalog section will open officially September 1st 2004.     Any artists that would like to have their CDs sold on our site and music played on our     Promotional Radio Streams can submit CD's for sale and a press kit and $15.00 set-up fee to:     James Lowe    KJAG Radio    C/O WKRP Audio Catalog    624 Sonora Drive    McPherson Kansas 67460      Be sure to visit the info on submissions page before you send your material because we    need a few forms signed in advance..    http://www.evor/com/wkrp/submit1.html

      Press release For immediate release  KMA keeps indie broadcasts and CD sales cooking with purchase of WKRP  MCPHERSON, Kansas – KMA Entertainment, parent company of KJAG Radio dot com, has purchased another internet broadcasting facility, WKRP dot FM. KMA will relaunch WKRP on the net with a full agenda come Sept. 1, 2004.  “It is a long time internet radio favorite,” said KMA’s James Lowe about the Illinois-based station that broadcasts on the World Wide Web. “The purchase includes WKRP’s audio CD catalog business.”  KJAG Radio recently relaunched its web streams of music and talk programs after a long hiatus and a move from Hutchinson to McPherson. The new KJAG is offering 24-hour programming, with its flagship Jiggy Jaguar show and the syndicated Cotolo Chronicles headlining the talk streams.  WKRP hosts a large independent music CD store that is still growing. The former owner built the feature in association with EvO:R, a community for selected performing free-agent musicians. EvO:R chief Charlie Harrelson has agreed to continue his participation in the program and its growth with Mr. Lowe. Additional bands will be allowed to submit press kits and CDs for play and consignment sales up until Aug.15. Submissions are free up to the deadline. After that a small set-up fee will be required to get added to the site.   “We are interested in bringing KJAG artists who are not currently on board with WKRP's audio CD catalog,” says Lowe. “This will present an opportunity to make some money on the side plus getting music to people who are involved in listening to internet radio. WKRP and its audio catalog will be down until Sept. 1, 2004. Any info needed can be sent to KJAG Radio E-mail.  “KMA entertainment is moving forward with providing an alternative to the massive mainstream media, which is only letting a certain amount of people play on their field. We say as long as you have the will, we have the way.”   –30—

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Contact: James Rogene Lowe KJAG Radio 620-480-9037 206-338-2590 kjagradio@kjagradio.com http://www.kjagradio.com McPherson Kansas to get 1st internet radio station McPherson, Kansas, May 1st 2004 — the people of McPherson Kansas have saw lots of changes and now they can hear them as well. The folks at KJAG Radio will be bringing their brand of internet radio to McPherson Kansas. KJAG Radio is an online only, streaming media station that plays unsigned bands and local musical artists plus some internet only broadcasts. The Attitude Radio Network as KJAG as been called for 4 years is moving from a successful home base of Hutchinson Kansas to McPherson Kansas to spread the word of unsigned bands and provide outlets to other voices that mainstream/AM and FM radio fail to provide. KJAG Radio will sign online at http://www.kjagradio.com on May 1st 2004. The station has done a lot in 4 years from doing concert remote broadcasts to ticket giveaways to playing artists who range from McPherson all the way to Japan and every which way in between. KJAG Radio started in the fall of 2000 with it’s maiden voyage coming at the American Legion in McPherson Kansas for a live internet broadcast of  it’s flagship morning program, “The Jiggy Jaguar Show” to coincide with an event called “Halloween 2000” presented by KJAG Radio and a local concert promoter. KJAG has accomplished a lot in the past 4 years with bringing unsigned artists from all over the planet with a chance for airplay and also interview and cd review opportunities though it’s online music magazine, “The Mic”. KJAG was the only internet station to do ticket giveaways for the rap group “Insane Clown Posse” when they performed in Wichita. KJAG Radio will be doing Weekly Street interviews with area residents for their question and comment segment called “Live on the street” it will be presented by area merchant, “The Bookshelf”. KJAG Radio is going to be bringing its unique brand of radio to the area with the help of many internet programs such as “Cyber line” an internet affairs and technology talk program which is presented on the weekend lineup. “The programming and music is something no one in the area have yet to experience,” –Travis Iverson{Asst. PD KJAG Radio}

        urlLink       RPUSA MEDIA RELEASE   ~     7 AUGUST 2004     ~     RPUSA MEDIA RELEASE    REORGANIZED REFORM PARTY USA RESPONDS TO   7 AUGUST 2004 WEEKLY WHITE HOUSE RADIO ADDRESS!      Of all the radio addresses from the White House each week, the one today perhaps is the most egregious ever presented by George W. Bush as he claimed his duty on the one hand is to ‘protect our country’, while on the other falsely claiming to ‘secure our borders’!    When several thousand illegal Mexican immigrants come across ‘our borders’ everyday, unchecked, undocumented, and uncontrolled, how can anyone justly proclaim that our borders are ‘secure’?    And what good is some new government agency calling itself, ‘Homeland Security’, when the southern borders of California, New Mexico, Arizona & Texas are wide open to the growing Mexican invasion, and there are no physical, moral or economic restraints?    The hypocrisy of such statements is becoming legendary for the ‘Bush regime’ as grandiose claims made on the radio weekly are confronted by the stark reality of yet more failed domestic and foreign policies that keep mounting!       Can any of the alleged ‘tools of the Patriot Act to track terrorists within our borders’ assist the Native American territories at Fort Yuma or Cocopah from being invaded daily by thousands of illegal Mexicans?   Have those sovereign lands by Treaty been offered any additional assistance, on the order that foreign aid has been offered to other countries, or ‘tax credits’ for ‘outsourcing’ to give away yet more American jobs?    We think not!    In fact we think that the so-called ‘War on Terror’ is just as bogus as the ‘War on Poverty’ since America has ten-thousand times more homeless now than before  ‘that war’ allegedly began!   And what about the ‘War on Drugs’?   Hasn’t the American presence in Kabul, Afghanistan, simply made the ‘drug trade’ safer for those growers and traffickers?                    That’s why the Reform Party USA recently reorganized because we believe that Americans need ‘real reform’, all across the board, and not simply more lip service and vane proclamations!  The propaganda from the White House is sounding more and more like that of a ‘Banana Republic’ just before completely collapsing under its own lies and corruption!  But in the case of America, the whole world is looking on, only to see policy blunders continue instead of moral leadership!      Anyone who has ever read the Declaration of Independence knows the ‘tools’ being employed in the alleged ‘War on Terror’ and ‘War on Drugs’ are the very same abuses done to Our Forefathers by King George III in the bill of particulars listed therein!    When Bush claims he wants to ‘create the position of a National Intelligence Director’, and ‘establish a new National Counter-Terrorism Center’, to coordinate with the ‘Terrorist Threat Integration Center’, to provide a ‘daily terrorism threat report’ – doesn’t this sounds like the usurpations copied from the pages of the book, ‘1984’ by George Orwell?    Is George W. Bush erecting a multitude of New Offices, and sending hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance?   Is Bush affecting to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power?   Do not his new laws deprive us in many cases of the benefits of ‘Trial by jury’?    Or how about transporting folks beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses?   Just how do the actions of the ‘Bush regime’ stand up to the scrutiny of our historic Bill of Rights as Unalienable Rights?       That is why the Reform Party USA is building a new alternative political party to offer a viable Pro-Veteran & Pro-Labor ticket in 2008!    We believe Americans can do better than the so-called ‘two party system’ that has the same corporate owners, same type of scandals, same warmongers, and the same failed foreign and domestic policies!   That’s why the ‘10 POINTS of REFORM for AMERICA’ calls for the restoration of the U.S. Treasury Bank to eliminate the national debt, establish an honest money supply, and restore economic prosperity!   We believe Americans would rather buy one home for themselves for the cost of materials and labor instead of buying three homes for moneylenders under the interest/usury of a thirty-year mortgage?   We believe that placing The Common Good before Self or any Special Interest, and Breaking the Bondage of Debt & Taxes can solve all our national problems!    And we believe that having a more evenhanded foreign policy can do more to restore Peace ~ than the spending of billions of dollars to war-profiteers under the guise of fighting suspected ghosts or calling them terrorists!   That’s why we believe ‘Reform’ will be the political solution of the future by putting America First!       END OF RESPONSE TO WEEKLY RADIO MESSAGE ~       This is a joint communiqué by the newly reorganized Reform Party USA and the RPUSA-Action Group, a PAC, issued by Jerry Heinemann, Interim National Secretary / RPUSA, P.O. Box 488, Elkins, WV 26241; 1.304.456.4565 or 3282 (also fax); website at:   Email:  .

JOKE OF THE DAY   DAUGHTER'S LETTER HOME FROM COLLEGE     ************************************     An exact replica of a letter a daughter wrote to her parents    from college:     Dear Mom and Dad,     It has now been three months since I left for college. I have    been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for my    thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring    you up to date now, but, before you read on, please sit down.     YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN,    OKAY?     Well then, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull    fracture, and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the    window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my    arrival, are pretty well healed now. Fortunately, the fire    in the dormitory and my jump, were witnessed by an attendant    at the gas station near the dorm. He was the one who called    the fire department and the ambulance. He also visited me at    the hospital, and since I had nowhere to live because of the    burned out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to    share his apartment with him and his three buddies. It's    really a basement room, but it's kind of cute.     He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and    are planning to be married. We haven't set the exact date    yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show. Yes,    Mom and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking    forward to being grandparents! I know you will welcome the    baby and give it the love, devotion and tender care you gave    me when I was a child.     The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend    has some minor infection which prevents us from passing our    pre-marital blood tests, and I carelessly caught it from him.    This will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am    having daily. I know you will welcome him into our family with    open arms. He is kind and, although not well educated, he is    ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion    than ours, I know your often expressed tolerance will not    permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is    different than ours. I am sure you will love him as I do. His    family background is good, too, for I am told that his father    is an important weapons dealer in the village in Africa from    which he came.     Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell you that    there was no dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a    skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant    and I am not engaged. I do not have syphilis and there is no    man (of any color) in my life.     However, I got a 'D' in History and an 'F' in Science, and I    wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.
