      "It's not that I'm so smart , it's just that I stay with problems longer ." - Albert Einstein  i love this quote of Albert Einstein. It's actually hard to pick a favorite quote of his because he has so many. But i chose this one in particular because it directly relates to advertising. Albert Einstein was a genuis. He was without doubt one of the smartest people who ever lived, but he believes that the reason for his success was that he worked harder. He stayed with problems longer and thought about them longer. This quote should be hung up inside every advertising agency and advertising school. Talent is important, being smart helps, and knowing how to think is essential, but the way you solve creative problems is by working on them...and working on them. You have to be relentless in your search for an answer. You have to know that your first 100 ideas will be lame or have been done before. You have to bang out every stupid/pointless idea, pun or joke you have in you and then keep going. Only by constantly doing that will you uncover original ideas or original uses of ideas. You can't expect to sit down and write a great ad in minutes...I'm sure it has happened. But those are the lucky ones. The really insightful work comes from minds that will not rest...from people who aren't satisfied until they uncover the gold that lies in every brief. These are the people who create great works of art. These are the people who can crack any problem you throw out them.

      I think being creative lies in 4 things.  1) learning the most you can about creativity and art. That means reading every book you can on advertising and having an unsatiable thirst for literature, film, and art. The person who is the most educated will have a better foundation from which to build on. They will know what great art is. They will know what techniques will provide the desired effects or emotions they want to create. They will be knowlegable to make a decision and to back it up because they have done the research and have seen what's been done before.  2) Relizing that creativity is a craft. When I hear people say "you can't teach creativity" I want to tell them to get the hell out of an art school then, because they are wasting their time and more importantly mine. Thinking creatively is a skill that you master by learning techniques and doing things over and over and over. You must challenge you mind to think laterally and forgo the usual paths of thought. You must push yourself to think in a way that will produce great ideas that will effect people.  3) Work until you can't work anymore. That's the only way you will ever get to the great ideas. If you go with your first idea, odds are everyone will have that idea too. You can be satisfied with getting a concept and doing 10 ads. You have to do 100...you have to rewrite headlines until you feel sick...you have to think of as many visuals for your concept as you can. You have to go as far out as you can and just keeping producing ideas. The more ideas the better, because 99% of them will suck. And if you think that you're so good that you solve things on the first go, then have fun working in kinkos for the rest of your life.  4) Never stop growing. Too often a writer, director, or even client creates something great and then becomes content to ride that for as long as possible. They become complacent and refused to push themselves. They find what is comfortable and stick with it over and over. They wind up producing the same ideas over and over. That is creative suicide. By refusing to constantly learn and grow, you become stagnant in a world where things are forever changing. You will never be great unless you constantly force yourself to be uncomfortable ...unless you constantly put yourself in new stuations. You must always be ready to experience the new and unusual.  And most imprtantly, you must always be pushing your work to the next level. You can never be satified or you are dead.  That is what I think is the key to creativity. How do I think I excel or lack in it? I don't know, I'm just at the beginning of a long journey.

      Allright, here's the deal. You have 2 best friends who just graduated college. They sit around watching cartoons and eating potato chips as they try to figure what to do with the rest of their lives. They are prompted by their mom's nagging to "get a real job," and answer an ad for a sales job. What ensues is a hilarious day as the two friends are sent out into "the field" to try to learn the dangerous world of door to door salesmen. From being chased by the cops to breaking into buildings to confronting a harley driving biker, the craziness never ends. And to top it all off, it turns out that the company is actually a cult out to spread their JUICE (join us in creating excitemnt) gospel. Hilarious to the end.  And don't no one think about writing this...it's already written. Not that any sane person would though.

      Suggested topics for Bloggs  1) research an ad agency and briefly describes its history, famous campaigns and staff.  2) Find a favorite long copy ad, find out who wrote it and describe his/her style. Maybe try to imitate it.  3) pick apart your favorite campaign and find out who did it, why it works and why it was different.  4) Talk about your individual taste, your passion, and how that ads to your concepting skills. (for example: I love to read novels and I believe its important to know how the great writers write.)  5) Make a list of required reading for anybody in this class. Include any advertising book you think is a must have, any film/book/art that you believe shows the essence of creativity.

      Dear Brett Johnson,      I am writing to give you a suggestion to make The Creative Circus a more professional and sophisticated place to learn. My suggestion is that you require a day long orientation for incoming students to teach them about some of the practical and professional aspects of advertising. I say this, because I find it really sad when there are people in the program who don't know what Weiden and Kennedy is, or will look at you with a blank face when you say Luke Sullivan, or Jaime Barret.      Serious students of advertising MUST take an interest in what is happening in their profession and that includes the history of advertising. How can you expect to write great ads when you have never heard of the ONE CLUB or CA? How can you expect to have a meaningful conversation with your partner when you can't reference classic campaigns like avis, rolling stone, volkswagen, or Nike.     I am stressing this because when you become part of a team it is your RESPONSIBILTY to do the best, most creative work you can. And I don't think that is possible unless you have a thorough understanding of advertising and what makes great advertising great.      It is a shame when you someone says "hey whipple, what's that?" It is a shame when people proudly flash their first quarter ads consisting of puns and 50's cliche ad speak. And most of all, It will be a shame when your partner doesn't contribute anything to your concepting.      I'm not saying that everyone should be an experienced advertising genius when they enter. The point in education is for people to learn and experience here. I just believe that if you are really serious about getting a job in this extremely competitive field you must become the most well educated person on advertising as you can. And I think that is what will seperate the student body from a typical art School. This is not play time...this is a professional training school dedicated to providing students with the skills and craft they need to be successful. And it should be a place that demands only the best of its students.  Sincerely,  Nicholas Zafonte

      Top 10 Most over rated celebrities things  (in no order)  &nbsp;  1. Ben stiller - Alright, Ben Stiller was cool a while ago, but then something happened. He became the king of over the top characters. Now, I know people like that, but I don't find it funny anymore.&nbsp;Mainstream Comedies aren't worth watching anymore.  &nbsp;  2. Jack Black - I know some people are going to want to kill me. But I have to admit, I don't get the infatuation with Jack Black. He is cool and his characters are cool, but his band isn't cool. Parody is funny, but it's not true art. (in my book anyway.)  &nbsp;  3. Jessica Simpson - She is definitly good looking, but I don't understand why people obsess over her. Like there aren't a million blondes in the world. Not that I don't like blondes, don't get me wrong...it's just there are girls just as hot who aren't so dumb.  &nbsp;  4. The Rolling Stones - I like Classic rock, but the Rolling Stones have been doing the same shit for too long. They were cool in the 60's, but by time I heard of them, they were already old and dried up (creatively). They don't evolve and that is what I respect in artists.  &nbsp;  5. Anyone on a reality show - do people still watch these things?! Did intelligent people ever really watch them?! Sorry if I offend anyone.  &nbsp;  6. Quentin Tarantino - Alright, before you track me down and kill me, hear me out. He is cool and he is definitly a talented director. BUT, how many times can you make the same movie. Before I sit down to watch, I already know what's going to happen: drugs, the f*&amp;% word, violence with gun, sword, or both, and interesting dialogue about things no one really cares about. I do think he is pretty&nbsp;cool...just not a genius flimmaker.  &nbsp;  7. Virginia Woolf - Not that she is really famous. But she is definitly one of those authors "educated people" are supposed to read. She is cool and she writes beautifully, but having to struggle through everything she writes definitly makes her lose points as a writer.  &nbsp;  8. Iron chef - Is this still popular? I can't stand it if it is. Sitting on your fat butt watching people cook food and eat food is probably the saddest thing I have ever witnessed in my life. Almost as bad as watching shows like "Single in LA," as you sit home, all alone.  &nbsp;  9. Friends - Okay, It might have been a cool show, I never really watched it. But how many times can you watch people get into unrealistic conflicts time and time again and then see everything all tied up nice and neat in the last 5 minutes. (Hmm, maybe my hatred of TV and Comedy bias me)  &nbsp;  10. The Bachelor/Bachelorette shows - Like the Iron Chef...are you seriously going to sit on your butt and watch beautiful people hook up and talk about it? I personally get nauseus watching that crap...except if I have to be dating some beautiful girl who like to watch it and cuddle in bed.

      I just spent my first time ever with my head in a 14x17 100% rag translucent marker pad...and&nbsp;I spent a half hour in it. I was never in such a place. Sure, I have seen tons of them. I have seen tons of people sitting with their heads in them...heck, I have some friends who would spend hours of their quality time in theirs. But I never was tempted. Sure, I looked, I peeked, but I was never persuaded to actually buy one of my own and stick my head in it.  (Warning: If you think this is sexual, stop reading right now, you'll find it to be very anti-climatic. And I wouldn't want to disappoint anyone looking for free porn, I know how frustrating that can be).  So anyway, I got mine home, and at the orders of my teacher, Sylvia, grabbed a sharpie and stuck my head in. I was just drawing thumbnails, having fun, making shapes, but I kept hearing this voice in my head "One example of Point force, One example of Swelling force, One Example of centripedal force, and don't forget your AOF." It repeated in my mind, over and over. So I did what anybody hearing a mysterious voice with a southern accent repeating in my mind would do: I listened to it. And once I accepted the voice and didn't bother fighting it, or even trying to figure it out, something happened. I can't really explain it, but it was kinda cool. There was friction, there was heavy breathing, there was a little squeky sound, there even was a weird smell, but I tried to ignore that. I was hard work, but I kept at. I wasn't going to quit until I got it right. And than after what seemed like a few minutes but proved to be much more, I was done...I was spent. And in front of me, I had a heaping pile of doodads. That's the only thing I can call them really. I don't know what other people would think of them, but when I look&nbsp;at them, I see things. Patterns, focus, direction, thought, even genius...well, not really genius, but maybe&nbsp;proof that i was learning something.&nbsp; What I'm learning, I'm not quite sure. But sometimes knowledge works like that. You study and work and read and experience and ask and observe and think and attempt for ever and ever and then all of&nbsp;a sudden, something clicks and you're smarter or quicker or more clever or more educated or more literate or more creative or more something that proves to be beneficial. That's the thing about learning...it can all be beneficial if you just find a use for&nbsp;it.  So, that is my next&nbsp;step...find a use for making cool little doodads&nbsp;that smell&nbsp;kinda funny and leave a black mark on your finger if you try to touch it. I better get to work.&nbsp;

      Hmm...life as a pill bottle. I would first have to say that I hope I'm not one of those really new ones that have the crazy, impossible to open child proof tops. They are a little too out of hand for me. Not that I'm dumb...I just hate having to squeeze things in weird ways as I twist something. Not that I wouldn't be good at that if had to.      So, like I said, I would be an older bottle, but not ancient. Modern, not contemporary. I would be orange, which is not a color i really prefer to be. It just seems like the only color that pill bottles can be. Maybe I can be denim, that would be kinda cool. And have a black top, instead of the standard white tops...i don't really love the color white, so wouldn't want that to be my main area of activity.      Maybe my label could be written in reverse type. That would look cool, but would probably be too hard to read. Especially for elderly people who have real serious health problems. I wouldn't want to accidentally hurt someone. Plus, if they died, they wouldn't be able to refill me anymore...and if I was a pill bottle I would probably live for that. It's like you wait all month as your supply gets lower and lower. And than just before you're finally about to get out of the house your sickly owner takes too many pills and dies on you. That would be a very anti-climatic life.     So, back to me being a pill bottle. If I had to have pills in me I would hope they would be something beneficial to my owner. Not illegal drug or anything. Not that I have a problem with  people who take illegal drugs, just that I wouldn't want to be the supplier for them. I wouldn't mind as much if I was making crazy money and had a hot car and sick apartment and crazy people hanging around all hours of the night. But since that isn't the case, I would rather be something healthy...like a heart medicine or an allergy medicine. Oh, and I wouldn't want to be something like viagra. Not that I don't that is beneficial to someone...God knows it could be a life saver...it is just that I don't really want to be that guy. Like being a film director is really cool...but being a porn director? Not so cool.     All right, I think that's all I have to say about being a pill bottle. Later  Nick

          I just got into atlanta a week ago. I'm attending the Creative Circus for copywriting. So far everything seems pretty cool here. The weather is nice...i live in an awesome big place that has a pool and tennis courts and a gym. Maybe this isn't anything new to southerners, but in New York you would pay double what I pay and barely get a room to put your bed in. Besides that, the city seems pretty cool. I've been out a little and it seems like each neighborhood has it's own vibe. Clubs in Buckhead, pubs in the Highlands. if anyone is reading this, feel free to give me some tips on where to go.     hmm...i was never really the journal type. I definitly think it is important to get used to writing everyday and filling the page...but I never got into writing down my feelings. I'm a fiction writer so i kinda feel that any writing I do should be going towards one of my projects...my projects right now are film scripts that I write. I've heard that a sure fire way to get good at writing movies (besides learning the 3 act structure and reading certain books) is to write 5 scripts. Stop saying you are and just write them. The odds are that they will all suck and that you will be embarrassed to show anyone them. But maybe, hopefully, after you bang out a couple you will start to learn how to write good dialogue...you will start to learn how to pace a story (which is definitly an art...how many times have you felt bored during a movie...that's because of bad pacing).      So, I'm now on the second draft of my 3rd script. It's not that good...I don't really like it...i don't want to ever show anybody it accept for a good friend/writer/personal editor of mine. It's funny...I know it sucks, but I just want to finish the final draft, print it out and put it on the shelf. Just because it sucks doesn't mean I'm not going to obsess over it, edit and re-edit it. It might suck, but hopefully it makes sense and is readable. Then when I'm done, it's like "next". I already have a list of 10 scripts that i want to write...so, hopefully by the time the 10th one is done, i will be some mastermind writer who can bang out a scipt in any genre that will be intelligent, well written, well paced!, and rewarding to watch.     Alright, that's enough for now.  Nick

      I don't have any idea who i would want to run for president...not only am I extremely disinterested in politics but I realize that the people I asscociate with are not the kinds I would like running this country. Maybe if the country was more of an island where people wore grass skirts and coconut shells...where we had to hunt for our meat and build our own shelters. Where we would fish, cook, and grow our own food. Maybe then I would have some friends who would be great leaders of this primitive culture. Though, come to think of it,  most of my friends are probably wussies and couldn't handle it. They might go crying home to their TV's and non-stop reruns of survivor. But, if maybe our culture was a collection of brains in vats who just sat their creating ideas all day long. People could think up anything they wanted to...ads, films, music, new sports (especially ones that don't suck i.e. baseketball). This would be a culture composed entirely of artists...and the only communication would be through sparks of neronic activity. We wouldn't have to bother learning how to spell neronic because we would just spark it to eachother. We wouldn't have to eat anymore, we wouldn't have to worry about the weather...our only obsessions would be to create the best ideas we can...a literal think tank of brains in some oozy, gooey liquid, because everyone knows that brains need oozy, gooey liquid to sustain themselves. Without it, we would surely dry up and die. We would only be dependent on one thing from the outside world and that would be someone to periodically check our vats and make sure that the oozy gooey liquid was filled to a sufficient level. If that is the way our world was than I would appoint Pedro...the guy who works at the gas station by me. He seems very qualified at filling things up to their right levels...and we wouldn't have to worry about him pouring in too much and wasting some of the oozy gooey liquid because of all of the times I have gone to him he has never once gone over the amount I specified...either he has amazng pouring dexterity or maybe the machines are now automated...if that is the case than maybe we can just do away with Pedro and have an automated machine be in charge of filling our vats with the precious oozy gooey liquid. Come to think of, I would rather have a robot in charge of my life than some no good high school drop out gas pumper named pedro.

      I Nicholas Zafonte hereby give permission to my lawyer, Dominic Zafonte, to handle my estate and see to it that my property is dispersed as follows:  My porn colelction of 10 videos goes to Daniel Barone. Apologize for the fact that the one with Brianna Banks has ripped and needs repair before watching.  My comic book collection, not that I have that many, goes to Dominc Zafonte, even though he mistakenly assumes that they are already all his. I would just like to remind him that most of the collection was acquired by illegal means and therefore to be cautious in the resell of them.  My advertising book collection goes to Evan Hackworth. I know he will appreciate all of them and learn from them. But one requirement before handing over ownership of my lofty collection, he must deposit his 2nd edition cutting edge advertising into my casket for burial...a small price to pay for recieving such knowledge.  My entire wardrobe...yes that includes my favorite diesel jeans and express chest showing shirt is to be given to the big brothers group. All of them must be packaged in black bags with my date of birth and death printed on the side in red.  My movie collection goes to jacky singer on the promise that she deposit her copy of "get over it" into my casket (i expect that I will never get enough of kirsten dunst...even in the after life)  Any money that I might have goes to my mother Marie Zafonte for all the aid and financial assistance she has given me.  Likewise the remainder of my unpaid college loans also go to my mother Marie Zafonte...bless her heart.  An unopend box of condoms in my nightstand goes to Andrew Efron hoping that he has more success than I have had in atlanta.  And lastly, my genius campaign for Fruit Roll ups that is sure to shock the world as well as dominate every award show it is run in goes to Aimee I don't know her last name for she is an art director and because of sylvia's class never goes out.  The rest of property including my cd player, cds, extensive book collection, vcr, 2 large screen tvs are to be destroyed by fire in a public cerimony to be attended by all of my family and friends to show them that greed will get them nowhere.  Sincerely,  Nicholas Zafonte

      Hmm...if I had to invent a sport? I actually wouldn't want to invent another sport...I like the sports we have already...but maybe I would invent a "sport" that would combine elements of wrestling and chess. Because I think wrestling (and I don't mean that WWF shit people watch) is one of the most pure sports. It is basically man vs man...no balls, no hoops, not goal posts...and no teams. The man who wins is the best, not because his team pulled the weight. And chess because it is truly the thinking man's game. You have to have a strategy when you play it...you can't be all over the place...and you have to think ahead to the consequences of your actions. What if maybe you had a team of 5 wrestlers, all of different weight classes...but they had to wrestle all of the other teams 5 wrestlers...and the strategy was in who you would put against who first. Maybe having a big guy tire out the other teams star wrestler would make it better when it came down to wrestling someone who is better. It would be the ultimate in human endurance...like the movie diggs town where lou gossip jr has to box 20 guys in 24 hours. The corrupt mayor guy who owns the town tries to think of the best line up to beat gossip...is it putting all of your big guys first or maybe spreading them out, or saving them til the end. Or ist it using psychological tactis to undermine your oppositions confidence. All of these things must be factored in to create the best strategy...maybe what I'm really talking about is war...people confronting other people while a general makes strategic moves. I would like to play a war game (if noone dies that is). Maybe when I finally get out into the real world I will try to organize games of paint ball where me and my friends can shoot each other and mimic a real war. Too bad that is already a sport...if it wasn't I would have invented it.

      For my Blogger on someone elses blogger I actually want to write about someone elses Blogger on someone elses blogger. So this is really a blogger on a blogger on a blogger. I read bonemarrow's blogger, hoping to have something to write about in my blogger, but instead I was left with a very disturbed feeling. I wasn't even sure if it was the right blogger, so that made me confused. So when I sat down to write my blogger, I didn't know what to say. "This person should get help." "Don't sit next to me in class." "Are you on any psychotropic drugs?" where a couple things that came to my mind. So, like any sane person grasping for some likewise sanity in this world, I decided to read someone elses blogger...and I read Invictus. And what do you know, they had a blogger writing about bonemarrow. So that's how I came upon my blogger on a blogger on blogger. Invictus summed up quite nicely everything I wanted to say about bonemarrows writing...sometimes 1 sentence is all that is really needed to get your idea accross "jesus h christ, life is hell." And sometimes english can't describe the feeling of frustration as eloquently as "juujdnjjnjjjjnmjjjjj." So now I am left to wonder...is bone marrow a certifiable nut or maybe just the james joyce of our time...because james joyce has similar passages in his writing...nonsense sentences or even just random typing that seems to represent inarticulation. And james joyce is usually thought of as the greatest modern novelist ever. So, back to bonemarrow...my real question I guess is who is bone marrow...is bone marrow the person who sits in our class or is there someone else who just happens to use that blogger. Or maybe the person in class is a friend of this bonemarrow and wanted to get their name out so they wrote it down on our sheet. Maybe Bone marrow is an underground poet and is spreading his name through word of mouth...because at least 2 people have already read his work and decided to write about it. Maybe if someone else reads this, they migh become interested and then go check out bonemarrow for themselves. Maybe one day bonemarrow will become the steven spielberg of poetry...everyone will know his name and his work...until then, I'm satisfied just to sit next to him/her in class.

      If I could have any super power, I would definitly chose to fly. As cliche as it sounds, flying would be the coolest thing in the world. Sure, things like x-ray vision or spidey senses would be cool, but would probably get lame after awhile. How many girls are you going to look at naked before it gets played out...or how many times do you have to sense a purse snatcher before you are like "jeez, leave me alone already." Though flying, I think, would never get dull. "I'm going to work, hun," and vroosh, you fly off. "I'm going to blockbuster," Vroosh! "I'm going to buy some crazy glue," Vroosh. And that would be the sound for it "vroosh." Kinda like mixture between vroom, the sound a race car makes, and swoosh, the sound that flying things make when they fly I guess. Flying would definitly be the coolest thing in the world. Just think of every movie or comic book character where someone flies...neo, superman, storm...these are always the character who kick ass...not just kinda kick ass, but really kick ass. Sure, teleporting would be fun and having razor sharp claws would be awesome, but what do you do if the person you're fighting just decides to fly away? I can just picture some tough, bad ass with crazy super powers being like "hey, that's not fair, come back here, I'm not through with you." Suddenly, that person doesn't seem so badass anymore, does he? And flying could be the ultimate relaxation. When I'm stressed out I take really long walks, just to clear my head. Usually I have a walk man on. Or sometimes I hop in my car (when I had a car) and just drive around forever with a cd on. There is something about wind that makes me relax alot faster, I don't know why, but it does. I could just imagine how awesome it would be to fly instead. The wind whipping through your hair. The sound of life going on 5,000 feet below you...the sight of huge buildings shrunken...that would be paradise. I'm one of those people who love to look out the window when I'm in a plane. I love being able to take in really large, grand scenes from a distance...there is something eerie about seeing the statue of liberty as a tiny figure below you...or seeing the empire state building as a tiny point. Maybe one day they will invent something like a personal rocket pack. As long as it wasn't too bulky and cumbersome, it would be cool...I would be up for it.

      There once was this animal named gill. He was hanging about his home, just doing the things that he always did. When suddenly he was scooped up by a large hand. He tried to wiggle and squirm the best he could, but he just could not break the grip. The hand closed tighter and tighter on him until he felt like his bones were going to snap. Then, just before he was about to lose consciousness, the grip was released and he dropped, landing with a slippery wet thump. At once he began to squirm again. As he squrimed about, he began to panic. Why was he stuck to the floor like this, he thought. Usually he would just float...now all of sudden he felt this force pushing him down. It was like when some of his bigger friends used to hold him down. But there was no one holding him down now, no one he could see. It took all of his effort to flop about and lift his body against this unseen force.     Then he realize that the atmosphere was different. When he tried to take water in and filter out the oxygen he found there was no wetness anymore. He did not know what to call the feeling...only unwetness. He sucked and sucked but he could never get a taste of the oxygen he needed. The atmosphere was no longer smooth and wet. It no longer moved and swayed, it was now still.     His body began to become unwet. He felt his skin become stiff and rough. He felt his fins begin to harden and flake. His mouth and eyes began to tighten, feeling like they were being pulled inside of himself. He had never known this odd feeling...this feeling of unwetness.     The last thing he noticed before drifting off was the huge sphere of bright yellow hanging overhead. He had seen this before, but never like this...never so close. He guessed he was closer because he felt the heat from this giant sphere. He believed it was partially responsible for his unwetness. He wondered what his friends would think about him being gone as his eyes crusted over and his organs collapsed.

      What is really easy about working on Maxim?  I definitly can relate to the market...young men who like to look at pictures of beautiful women...or actually men who drool over pictures of sexy, scantily clad, beautiful women in very suggestive positions. I understand why men buy magazines like this. They can't help it...the walk by them in a magazine shop and just have to stop and flip through. And if it happens to be some actress you really like or are a fan of their work...ahem...you definitly have to stop and look the spread over. You'll probably buy just to read the sexy things that she says about her sex life. I understand the power these magazines have over men. That should make it easy to find insights into what would make more men buy them. Talk about liking your target...I love my target because I am my target...to a certan extent anyway.  What is really hard about working on Maxim?  Writing ads that have sexual innuendos has been done so much that any cool idea you put up, people are like "I've seen it," or "been done." It's kinda hard to market things in a clever sexy way because alot of beer commercials have outplayed every sexual idea...even if it isn't relevent to their product. That's the worst, when a good idea is wasted on something that it shouldn't go with. What is going to be hard is to find something relevent, sexy, and creative that has bever been done before...of that has never been wasted on a stupid beer commercial.   Oh, I also hate those pictures of really gross things...that makes it hard to look at the magazine.

      I'm on a date with this guy and it's not going so well. Not that it's bad or anything, just not very exciting. This is going to be one of those times when my friends ask me what I didn't like about the guy and I won't know what to say.     "Was he ugly?" No, not really. "Was he rude?" No. "Was he stupid?" No. "Was he too serious?" No, well kinda, but not really.     This is why my friends say I'm shallow and too picky. This is why they always nag me about being single.     I don't know, it's just that i would like to be inspired by someone. It's nice to hear someone inspired about their life and their goals but something about this guy makes me want to fall asleep.     How many more times is he going to say that Fight Club is arguably the best film of the last ten years? Do people really use "arguably" in real life? And for how long can he go on about really good advertising that doesn't really exist in the real world...that only exists in these award annuals? That these ads are so good and clever and smart and inspiring. What good are these great ads when noone sees them I told him. And then he's says that sometimes the greatest art isn't always the most popular. That's when I think I might have almost vomitted. I felt the bile sting my throat, but managed to hold it in.    What a pompos asshole. Who the hell cares about art i think? And if i have to hear the word passion one more time...does this guy think this is some lecture where he is supposed to tell me about what's really important in life. How there is more to life than working, paying bills, and watching TV.    At first I was impressed...I though, wow, what focus. An hour later i wanted to shoot myself. It's like going out on a date with my dad. I already know what I lack, I don't need some know it all to give me a page by page disertation on what every human seeking to transcend mundane existence should be doing with their life. Jesus, loosen up man. Learn to have fun. There is more to life than reading books and talking about your pursuit of intelligent art. I don't know what, but I sure as hell know there's got to be more than wasting my saturday night with a guy this lame. No, I'm sorry, he's not lame...just not my type. I can't expect everyone to be like me. I should respect him for his beliefs. And I should respect him for his goals...that doesn't mean I want to ever actually hear him go on and on and on about his goals. But I respect him to follow his own life...his own, seperate, not including me life.     I should've known when he said he was a writer.

      Hey,      This is the blog where I tell you the reader not to take my stuff too seriously. I think sometimes people write things and they get really worked up over things and get caught up in the moment and they wind up saying or writing things that they look back on and wish they never wrote.     It's kinda like in Jerry Mcquire...he stays up all night long writing this mission statement, thinking it is the right thing to do...then after he wakes up in the morning, he realizes the mistake he has made.     I'm not saying that I think I have written anything really harsh or even that important...it's just that I want to warn people that I might say things that sound preachy...but that's not really the way I feel about things.     One of the things that we often forget is how everyone is so different than eachother...everyone has different goals in life...even different reason for being at the circus. And one of the great things is that each person has something they truly love outside of advertising. I love to read books and watch movies, someone else might love art, someone else might love hip hop, someone else might love sports....the important thing is to realize that everyone is different and those differences are what give us power and individuality in our creativity. Having a passion for anything in life is what will make your work unique...and relevent. Our passions are what help define our voice and give everything we say and write character.     I also think that by writing in this blog, we are sharing a lot about what makes us who we are. And the fact that the class can read it can be a cool thing (letting us all in on the secret of who you are)...but it can also be a dangerous thing. Becuase like I said, sometimes people let their emotions get the best of them and write things that they don't really mean...or wind up coming off as something you really arent. I think that making our blogs public is a priveledge that shouldn't be abused. What people write is often what they cannot say. It is often the very things that sting them the most. It is how some of us vent. It is how some of us warm-up for writing ads. It is how some of us search for the real truths behind creativity. And to use those words written from the heart to hurt another person or to deface another person would be an injustice to what the circus represents. An open community of artists who are here to learn from one another and to push their creativity to the limits by experiencing and writing about it.     We should not forget that by being allowed to read other people's blogs we are being given the ultimate priveledge of getting inside the mind and hearts of our peers. We should always respect that.
