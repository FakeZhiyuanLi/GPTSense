       Update 1: 12:09:58 PM  Heard a voice mail left on my HP when i woke up yesterday morning. Total left me disgusted and make me lost all my respect to that person. I can't say what actually happen but it definitely spoils my day and many more to come. I will not disclose what i heard but don't think i can ever forgive him for saying what he did. One has to account for whatever come out of his/her mouth. I'm lost. Like a wreakage flooding in the ocean. I don't know how i can handle this issue. One thing i do know... I have to be strong...  Being the eldest of my siblings... responsibilities really weights me down... if only i can put everything aside and just leave...   Update 2: 11:28:32 PM  Had my appraisal done this afternoon. The whole session lasted 2 whole hours. Can you believe it? Anyway, it was a very stressful session. I'm told by my superiors how they thought i fared this year, their expectation of myself next year. Not forgetting their "lecturing". I came out of the room having a splitting headache. Even now as i'm typing this blog, my head is still spinning. Guess i'm too stressed up. Gosh, i really need to unwind. Can't wait for weekends to be here so that i can go for a drink. :P     postCount('20031126');

      My friend Danny borrowed a lorry from his company over the weekend and we decided to do some travelling. hehe  Saturday Met up with Anson and his gf, Pink, at Pizza Hut (Marina) for dinner around 8pm. To friends of ours, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. They are officially couples now. I'm really happy for them. :)  At around 10.30, we parted with them and head down to Bedok for supper. Picked up Ivan and his gf (Seendly) along the way. Order three bowls of minced pork porridge, one plate of ten chicken wings, one plate of carrot cake and 10 sticks of O-TAR. End of the night. Think i gain another kg.  :|   Sunday Danny came with Ivan to pick me up at 3.30pm and we make our way down to Bugis. We did some window shopping. Call me sua ku or what. But i've just realised that there is a small arcade at the childrens section of the shopping mall that carters to kids and their parents. Children can play there without fear of being chased out. Cool. Took a break to rest our feet at Terra. A restaurant/cafe that we always hang out at. Ordered 3 cups of drinks and spend the afternoon chatting. part of the conversation is about gals that walk pass. eg, that gal's hair nice, that skirt very short, nice legs. haha. Saw one of our ex-superior in NS and got to know that he just came back from an attachment to East Timor. Glad that he is back safely. Dinner was very good. We had steamboat buffet at one of the restaurant along the rows of shophouses being Parco Bugis. There are some food that is like the usual  buffet where you just pick what you want off the rack. There is another list that you can order without any additional charge. Total of 55 variety. For only $15+ per head. It is well worth it. :)     postCount('20031123');

      My first post after a while. My first attempt posting using Blogger.  Had a freak accident this evening while at school. I was on my way to the lecture theatre. The floor was pretty wet as it is raining cats and dogs. Ah, you've guessed it. I slipped. And its right in front of about 10 or so coursemates. '-'; My right shoe fly 1m away, and i landed on my back. Luckily i had my school bag as cushion. Still i had a knock on my left elbow and hurt my back. It's the second time i hurt the same spot on my left elbow. Think it is going to take a longer time to heal this time round. :(  Pop by Victor's Bowl @ 9.15pm to support Alvin. He was participating in a bowling competition. Pretty decent effort and i'm sure he will keep improving. :)   urlLink   postCount('20031118');

      LIBRA MAN   A man who has no balance like his Zodiac symbol. He is not the gentle, cool, calm and charming guy like what you see. He has another dark side of  aggression, stubborn and he likes to start an argument the most. Sometimes  he can be so depress and unstable. Up and down like he is trying to balance  himself most of the time.    To many people, he is a friendly guy and always smile even when he is mad or  up set. His voice always gentle and calm. he always set and comb his hair as  if he comes out from a shampoo advertisement. Mostly Libra men are good  looking, even the ugly one is charming. When he smiles, it is so bright that  the whole world is smiling with him too.    When he is in a balance mood, he is the type of person you want to be with.  In other unbalancing mood, he likes to make people argue about something and  watching it with fascination and fun. He will wait to be the one who  compromise and clear thing up. He likes to be in a conflicting conversation.    Libra man is lazy by nature. After his tired day at work, he likes to sit  still and just look out of the window or read quietly. He likes to be in his  own world. After recharging his battery, he will be very energetic again and  may even take you out that night.    Libra man normally will not do any shocking or abnormal things to be  noticed. He likes to be conformed with his crowd, but if you watch him  carefully, you will see the different. If he wear a shirt, it will have to  be a zipper front instead of buttons, or a special tie bar. There is always  something in him that he will not allow totally conformity to take him over.    A straight forward , no non-sense guy. He is careful and delicate in  details. He will spent extra time to doing it right, than comes back to  correct them later. He hates people who boost, or exaggerate. He does not  like over dressed woman or make herself a center of an attention.    He loves to read. He loves poems and loves art. When he works he can work  like crazy, but after work he can turn on romantic jazzy music and treat you  so gently. He loves to give people advice and normally give a good advice.  If you fall for him, you will stay like being trapped in a spider web. If  you want to break up with him, he will persuade you a zillion ways to stay  and you can not stop him anyway. After he persuade you to stay, or after a  big fight, he will be so sweet to you as if he has never hurt your feeling  before ever.    He will has his own way to win a girl love and affection. Once she says yes,  he will lay back and wonder if he should go on or if he should back out. In  his teen, he changed many girl friends because he can not clearly separate  loving a friend and loving a girl friend. He will check and re-cheek if his  match is suitable and compatible with him.    Even he is a romantic man, he can hardly understand the emotion of the one  he loves. He is a generous guy even he sets his life so systematically. He  never knows when he makes you unhappy. He never knows how he up set you. He  will never knows what he said wrong. If he is your lover, be prepare for  this.    A not so pretty girl with no brain is not his type of woman. If you are not  pretty enough, he will not mind talking to you but he does not care to get  to know you. Any girls, pretty or ugly can ask for his help, he will be  happy to help. He hates to argue by yelling at each other, so you tend to  see he argue with his girl friend seriously but try at best to be very  quiet.    He likes to have a girl friend by getting to know each other like a friend  first. If you want him, you have to like the same thing he does. He prefers  a pretty and gentle woman than a smart and ugly woman. You have to  understand his mood especially he can has many different moods. He is a  private person, so when he needs to be alone better let him be.

      I should have known. Today is a terrible day for me. :(   Incident no 1.  Woke up by a sudden leg cramp (left leg) this morning. Reflex action made me sit upright trying to pull back my foot to ease the cramps. In the mean time, my head is spinning from the sudden "awakeness". After the cramp died down a little, I slam back to back trying to "nurse" my spinning head.   Incident no 2. Another indicator that this is a bad day...  I finally got out of bed at 12 noon. My left calf muscle is still feeling tight and head has cleared. Arrange to meet Ivan at Orchard at 4pm to do some shopping. Had my lunch, bath and make my way to the train station at 3.30pm. I was happily standing on the platform waiting for the next train when i suddenly recalled that i did not bring out my Takashimaya vouchers. oh man. Quickly call my brother to bring it to the station for me.   Incident no 3.  The rest of the day went on smoothly. I bought 2 of the 5 items that i had intended to buy. A new swatch watch at $116 and a pair of new business shoes at $125. My next target will be a new sunglasses, casual shoe and maybe a pair of cuff links. Oh yes, i need to pick up my 2 newly tailored shirt.  At 10.30pm, I left Orchard, took a cab down to Zouk with Danny and Joey. oh man... i left my wallet in the cab... i would normally check the seat before i close the car door but this time i overlooked it completely... i got out of the cab, slam the door shut and proceed to call alfie... damn... costly...  I have in the wallet my credit card, an ATM card, my SIM student card!! (now gotta spare some money 2 replace it), my transitlink card, some cash, my house keys and a few of my name cards.  I've called up Comfort Cab to submit a Lost and Found report as well as the bank to terminate my credit card.  I seriously hope that some kind soul will return everything. But as of now, I still waiting for some good new. :(     postCount('20031213');

      The Christmas mood is getting to me and i'm not getting any assignments done. :( Anyway, i'm going to do my christmas and new year shopping next saturday. I plan to buy new shoes (1 x business shoe, 1 x casual shoe, 1 x jogging shoe), a new sunglasses and a new watch. :)  The coming weeks will be hell for me. I have classes every night from Monday to Friday. oh man, just thinking of it makes me feel drained.  I have been watching a Japanese manga recently. The name of the manga is called Naruto. It is a comic about Ninjas. Pretty interesting and exciting.       urlLink Which Naruto Character are You?  quiz by  urlLink orangeday.net     I think the above describe me very well. Well....     postCount('20031207');

      Went to KBox Cineleisure to sing with Joseph, his colleague, JoJo and Whitney this afternoon. My first visit to a KBox outlet. Room design is pretty normal and quite clean as the place is still quite new. Overall experience is good. One down side for me personally. It is the remote control. It has chinese labels written on it. I really have problem adjusting to it cos i'm so used to the ones used by Tea Lovers.  Oh, and also KBox charges by per head. which means that it will cost more when you are in a big group, as compared to other karaokes.

      Woke up with a heavy head @ 12pm. Still suffering from hangover. Feeling thirsty, the effect of drinking too much.  Met Anson and Pink @ 3pm to go to the gym. Been some time since i last went. Only did a short run on the threadmill plus a bit of weights training. Don't want to push myself too hard.  After the workout, we went to orchard. Pink is suppose to look for her friend at the CitiBank Booth to sign up for a credit card i think. But her friend is on MC that day. So they went down with me to Paragon to buy a new HP. My old one, the GD88, is officially retired due to serious injuries. In it's replacement, i got a Samsung SGH-X430, a basic phone. Waited almost an hr plus just to buy the phone.  After buying the phone, we went to Heeren to "find" our dinner. Had dinner at a Thai restaurant. The food quite good, as least it is to my liking. But i had a problem with spicy food. I tend to perspire even when the food is slightly spicy... :(

      make a trip to J's place tonight @ 9.15pm. she lost her handphone charger earlier on. so i bought another original nokia charger, from a second hand dealer, as a replacement. meant to pass it to her earlier but i don't have the chance.  I reach tampines @ 9.45pm. waited a while for the bus and got to her block at 10.15pm. not knowing if she was at home or still outside. i decided to sit at the void deck till 10.30, before heading upstairs. once out of the lift, i proceed to her house and left it at her door step. after i done that, i send her an sms, then i went back into the lift. decided that i will wait at the void deck until i know the charger is in good hands.  J called me soon later. asked me where i was. told her i'm walking to the bus-stop. she said that since i'm here, why not meet up to have a talk.  we went to a coffee shop nearby and had a short talk. about an hr plus. i promise her that i will pack up my feelings and study hard. but in the end, the conclusion was still that we will break up. however she says i can still ask her out.  now, thinking back, i don't think i can give up on her completely. she was part of my life. and i still want her in my life. though i know things will be very different from now on. i can only wish myself luck.

      A lot of things have taken place within the space of 3 months. I feel a need to write down my thoughts... something that i've not been able to do freely this days... not even with my friends... and at least... i hope to keep them as memories... cause some of them are the happiest period of my life...   Jan 10/11, 2004. Night. The sky is clear, not much stars in sight. Was happily chatting with J. J is a very caring and sensitive (in a +ve manner) girl. we like and dislike almost the same kind of food, have the same interest, and i am comfortable talking to her. It is sometime after midnight when i pop the question. And she agreed to be my gf. It was the happiest night of my life.   Jan 17/18, 2004. Noon. I was having a pretty bad cough, even before we started going out together. Today, she told me that she is dropping by my home to pass me something to give to my parents. The date is pretty near to chinese new year so i expected "ba gua" or something. She did bring along a bag of "ba gua". But what melts my heart is when she hands me a bottle of "liang cha". She made the drink herself, but of cos under her mom's guidance. I was so touched. Though i didn't really expressed it out verbally. Some days later, I didn't know if it was the drink or her action, i got better and recovered.   Jan 21, 2004 It is Chinese New Year Eve today. I was at home watching TV after my reunion dinner. suddenly my HP rang. J is on the line. she roughly mention something that her brother's gf can't make it for the movies. so her family is asking me down to join them. her family has the tradition of catching a movie on the eve of CNY. that was 9.10pm. the show starts at 9.45pm. I quickly got dressed and took a cab down to tampines. and that's how i get to meet with her whole family members. The stern looking Father, the chatty Mother, the friendly elder sister, her hubby and her handsome brother. after the movie, we went down to One Fullerton. our cab got there just in time to catch the fireworks when the clock struck 12 midnight. It was beautiful and how happy i was to see her exclaiming her delights at those fireworks.   Jan 22, 2004 1st day of CNY. J drop by my place at my "request" that she come over and "pai nian" in the evening. This is the first time she met my parents. We went to danny's place to play cards that night. When we reach his place it is already quite late, around 11pm. Danny's mum seems unhappy that we are playing cards and drinking (only a little) at his place. She gave him the final timeline that we had to stop by 2am. After the row, we decided to switch over to alvin's place to continue with the game. and we stayed there till 5 in the morning.   Jan 23, 2004 2nd day of the CNY. Met up with ivan, seendly and danny for coffee at Terra Cafe in the evening. They are deciding on what to do after coffee. In the end, it was decided that we will go to alvin's place again tonight. Danny borrowed his company van over the new year so first, we brought ivan over to his relative place to "pai nian". Coincidentally, it is near to where i stay. When ivan went up, we proceed to send Seendly home first. Cos she is having stomach upset. After that, we turn around to pick up Ivan, but he told us to go to my house first. So to my place we went. Waited for ivan, but when he came over, he says that he is also having stomach upset. so he wants to go back liao too. the poor couple mst have taken some contaminated food. okie, so me and danny now go over to J's place. I had wanted to go over to "pai nian". An unfortunate thing happen while we were entering the multi-storey carpark. The van hit the dangling bar at the entrance and it cause a dent on the top of the van. Anyway, we moved to another one which has a higher height limit and made our way up to J's place. Her mom just got home from a mahjong session and we were fortunate to taste her mom's cooking. which so happens to be our dinner. time was 10+pm then. After that, the three of us went to alvin's place. to play cards again of cos. since on both nights, danny is the BIG winner. he graciously paid for supper at 3 am. We left alvin's place around 5.30am again. Anson offered to send us back and seeing that it's so late, i agreed. J seems unhappy about it. I know she wants to spend time with me. But i just want her to be able to rest early cos we have been staying out late for three days in a row liao.   Feb 7/8, 2004 J ask me if i remember what is coming up next week. I told her i don't know (pretending). In my heart, i am saying, "of cos i know dear, it's Vday". After a bit of pretending, i told her, "Vday huh.." :P But she ask again... what else?? This got me scratching my head for a good 10 mins... Then she told me, remember Feb 11?? It got me thinking again, this time trying hard to figure out if that day is another public holiday, or if it is her mom's, dad's, sister or brother's bday. and when she finally enlighten me, "it's our 2 month of being together..." it really struck me... Oh no, to think it actually didn't came to my mind... think all i could think of then, is how to make Vday a special day for her... X| i really sorry...   Feb 9 - 12, 2004 things between me and danny went downhill. sigh...   Feb 12, 2004 Am suppose to talk to danny with Ivan tonight. Danny pulled out last min. Ivan told me he was pissed off and don't want to talk to me. Seems that J had a conversation with him. Ivan advised that i should call her to find out what is going on. I was relectant at first, cos J is having a farewell dinner with her colleagues as one of them is leaving. But i still called in the end cos i need to know what happened. Found out what happened and i relay a message from ivan that at such a time now, she should hold back from making any comments. in relaying the message, i was not trying to tell her to "hands off" my problems. rather, i'm just trying to say that since things is already so bad, just hold back and let me and ivan try to resolve things. But J took what i said very badly, thinking that i am blaming her. But hell no, i did not and it was never my intention. But well, now i'm a sinner. In the end, me and ivan had dinner at BK West Mall and i had Ivan telling me off that night. I came to West Mall with a mission but left with nothing accomplished and with a heavier heart.   Feb 13, 2004 Put on a thick skin and went to join danny and ivan to club. Met Ivan at Tiong Bahru, he told me danny is not as angry liao. but now, i'm have another headache. J is unhappy with me. Or rather, she is disappointed with me. Tried to talk to danny as normal as i can. After clubbing while we are at the coffee shop, danny finally wanna talk about our problems. I try my best to apologies and ivan tried his best to help me to resolve the issue. We were forced to end our conversation as the coffee shop is closing. They boarded a cab once out of the shop. With no clear indication that danny is willing to forgive me, i felt dejected and i take a slow and quiet walk until clark quay before i got on a cab. Along the way, i msg J telling her "i did my best..."   Feb 14, 2004 J broke down before me. I felt so guilty that i don't know how to response. the only thing i can do is to hand her tissues to wipe her tears.. i'm so useless. I can see that she is trying hard to make this day a happy one. but seeing her forcing herself to put on a smile, it really hurts and sense of guilt overwhelm me. I don't want her to force herself. i'm really really sorry for making her feel so bad...   Feb 15, 2004 Things between me and J went straight down south.   Feb 16-20, 2004 she is avoiding my SMSs and emails. attempt to try to talk to her seems fruitless. I don't know if i can call her. in one of her short replies, she mentioned that she needs time to think. i tried as much as not to disturb her. but sometimes my head can't control my hands and i type a sms or email to her. i miss her and really wants to sort things out with her. i felt really bad.   Feb 21, 2004 felt low and so i asked danny and ivan out for coffee today. met them at 7pm seendly and rabbit came along slightly later. in the mist of it, ivan told me something that i wished i never had heard. but it is too late now. after hearing it, i got very dejected. i send an sms to J, "... let's break up ba... " i felt like crying when i send that out. but i'm in the public. i held back my tears. that night, after our supper at lau pat sat. i went to embargo with joseph for a drink. i had intended to make myself drunk. danny and rabbit pop by for a while, thought initially they are going back after supper. anyway, they only stayed till one plus. slightly around two, i can see that joseph is also pretty "high", due to all the "bottoms up" with me. so i send him going home too. So l'm left alone, looking at the sea, still trying hard to get myself drunk. Soon came 3am. At this point of time, i am drinking my third jug of Hoegaarden... and almost finishing. Sadly, i can feel my legs being wobbly, but my mind, seems so clear... i'm not drunk... just high... so feeling sad again, i make my way to the war memorial tower opposite Swissotel. I sat there for at least an hr. i wanted to cry out loud... but all i manage is sniffing back all my tears... finally decided that i'm tired enough to be able to fall to sleep when i get home, i got myself up and walked away to get a cab. i did have a sound sleep that night but only after many days of sleepless nights....   Feb 22, 2004 Everything seems so different today. I don't have the right to sms J anymore. Though i really wanted to see her sms, hear her voice... but it's not possible now. Went out with danny, ivan, seendly and alvin today... tried my best to act normal and i can see that they are carefully avoiding mentioning anything about J. but while i am physically with them, my heart and mind are with J...  I miss U. I Loved U. but I really hope you are better off without me... Take good care of yourself... Hope someone better than me comes along...  damn... i sniffing again...  *whatever i've said is just what i felt. no bad intention to anyone involved.*

      Spent most of my time in the office for the past two weeks... Everyday... i came to work at 8.30 in the morning and never left it till 10.30 at night... Sat... i got in at 12 and left for home at around 8.30... only when i hungry... The office seems like my second home... Like a breakwater sheltering me from the storm...  was chatting a bit with my mom earlier... suddenly as i was walking away... i heard her asked, "Hao xiang heng jiu mei kan dao ta le, wei she meh mei jiao ta shang lai zhuo?". I did not answer and immediately pretend to listening to music... I did not know how to answer her... or is it because i still trying to hold on to a almost non visible hope...  One more week before i go back for reservist... A good 3 weeks away... Hope i can put everything aside by then...

      To love someone does not neccessary means to hold on to her. To love someone is just wanting her to be happy. As long as she is happy, i'm willing to disappear into the cold thin air....  To forget an unhappy event is not the same as avoiding it. To forget an unhappy event, you may try to follow the 4 step rule below....  1) Face It 2) Accept It 3) Overcome It 4) Let Go  only then, can u become truely happy again... only then, can I become truely happy again...

      met up with joseph, Jojo and her bf steven yesterday for dinner @ Suntec. steven is such a caring guy.  anyway, after dinner activity was... Window Shopping!! something guys don't normally do. keke  Jojo kept herself busy with all the clothes and jewellery shops while steven with the watches. Me and joseph? well... we don't really do window shopping so we chatted most of the time while waiting. oh, but we did walked into a shop selling shoes... looked around... nothing we wanted... and becos of that we lost track of Jojo and steven.  anyway, while we were walking (very fast) back to look for them, i noticed that our path was virtually block by a group of guys/girls in smart attire doing some sort of survey. tried our best not to look at them and i was chanting, "u can't see me", inside me.  :P think the chants worked for me but not for joseph. he got approached by a pretty lady. but before she can even finish her entire sentence, he rejected her. wah, first time i see him doing that leh. keke i'm impressed.  after the walk, we went over to One Fullerton to find Tommy around 9.30pm. then we preceed on to Dbl 0 to find steven, jojo and joseph. at the queue, i was stunned when the ladies requested to see our IC. and i didn't have it on me. damn. luckily i had my SIM student card with me. phew. went in, lots of babes and hunks... something i've noticed while in there... seems like most of the pretty babes smoke. hmm.. another thing i learned, Long Island Tea cost $60 dollars per jug. damn expensive. anyway, music started at 11pm, the drinks flow, and heads "roll"...  end of the day, i got home high on alcohol and wake up with a headache. :P

"i need time to think"... . . . frankly speaking, i losing faith in myself... i'm doubting my worth... in your heart... . . . i've tried my best to pretend that you are still my gf... so as not to let u feel insecure... but i myself is falling deeper and deeper into the insecure zone... . . . i'm not one who ask for much... i just want to be like last time... to be able to hold your hand while we take a stroll... to be able to hear you call me "dear"... . . . my candle of hope is very dim now... it will probably flickle off soon... . . . this email, i probably will never send out... it will serve me, as a memory of this point of my life...

      i can never understand what a girl think. especially when it's someone whom i was in love with before. i still like her now... but i don't know about her... and it's very frustrating, not with her but rather... with myself.    she said she needs time to think through… that was about 2 month ago... i let her be...  she asks me to treat her as per normal... as per when she is still my gf... i am trying my best... i carry on calling her "dear", "darling" etc... in return was simply non acknowledgement... a few times when i stop calling her "dear" or "darling", she will sms me saying she is feeling insecure and that whether i can give her some assurance... i obliged each time... but i always wondered... "where is my assurance?"... i'm feeling dejected... i've since given up calling her "dear" or "darling" during our face to face conversation...  whenever i'm out with her, there is no indication from her that i can be "normal" with her... i don't dare to even stand close to her... i want to hold her hand in mine... but i simply can't make myself do it... all these weights down on my heart...  our F2F conversation barely lasted 10 mins nowadays... telephone conversation barely lasted 5 to 10 mins... most of the time she cuts it short by saying she wants to go and watch TV... ie. VCDs... it hurts me every time she says it... watching VCDs seems more important to her...  there are times when she asks me if i have anything to tell her... seriously, whatever i can say, i will say... if she expects me to say sweet and intimate words, i can initially... but now, i can't... cos i don't even feel that way anymore... there is nothing that makes me feel that way...  we met up barely once a week or once every two weeks... she has since taken on a new part time job with AIA, about three weeks ago, i supported her... now, she was kept busy most of her weekday nights and weekends... even if we do meet up, it's only for around 3 hrs... and she is planning to convert to full time soon... this means she will be having lesser free time... she says she will be very busy for at least the next 3 months... having a friend who was in insurance sales too, i seriously think she will be busy till the day she quit... anyway, i simply replied her... "orr"...  sigh... my heart is starting to wilt... i hope it will not die before she is done with her "thinking"... i don't know how long i can still wait... now, i can only sigh out loud each time i think of her...

      Fourteen days since my last post. I have been pretty busy for the past two weeks. a little update from me...  i was working on... 1) my sch assignments... completed 3 in two weeks... did not really complete all the requirements... nevertheless, i'm done with them... one last batch of 3 assignments due by 1st April 2) work, tons of work are waiting for me... stressed... i wish i have more time...  what is coming up... 1) UOL revision classes starting on 20th March till early Apr. 2) 3 assignments due on 8th Apr, but i have to finish them by the 1st Apr. 3) Going for my first In Camp Training (ICT) on the 6th Apr till 28th Apr... A whole 3 weeks i'll be wearing greens... sweating... panting... cursing... in the dark and damp forest... digging countless trenches... donating my precious blood to the tireless battalion of mosquitoes. 4) My exams will be coming in May... no idea what is the exact date... i'm assuming it is in the early part of May.  hmm... not much time to study liao... really hope i can scrap through the exams with my tight schedule...  meantime, whoever still reads my blog... take care... catch up with u pple soon... :)

      My In-Camp Training is finally over!! Yippy!!! Three weeks... Three Hell weeks... But when i'm packing up to leave the camp, i'm actually missing the camp and my camp mates. WTF?!!  Took a day off today to rest at home. Got up at 12.30pm. Long time since i get to sleep till so late. Woke up, sort out 3 weeks worth of letters, bills and emails, etc. Made a trip to Ngee Ann ard 3.30pm, got there ard 4.30pm, to help my friend get her transcript. After that, i took a train all the way back to CityHall, walk around a bit before settling in at Citylink's Pacific Coffee. Bought a cup of Ice Cafe Mocha and a piece of Tiramisu. After that drop by MPH and bought a PC magazine. Stayed there for a whole 2 hrs till 8pm. I realised that it's not that bad to be out alone once in a while.  David called and ask me to join him at Boat Quay. I agreed cos i haven't seen him for a long while. Had some drinks, sing and played a bit of pool before we make our way home ard 12mn. Missed my dinner and i'm feeling hungry now. :P  Am going to sign an offer letter tomorrow. Will be joining another company. Hope it will be good start. :)

      1 more day before i'm back to the wild. kinda mixed feeling about it. well, it's my 1st ICT after all, so i'm feeling kinda worried. being posted to a operational unit is a big hurdle for me. guess 'll just have to try to pick up everything in the fastest time.  lying on the floor beside me are all my army stuff. i've more or less packed everything. but i still need to get a bigger bag to put whatever i can't put in the field pack. hmm... i still have the feeling i've missed out something.  was on leave on friday. suppose to spend the day doing my assignment. but somehow my computer got infected by virus/worm and i had to waste the day cleaning and scanning it.  went to karaoke with joseph and a few of my colleagues at KSter. it is a nicely decorated place and you can even have the option to just sit down on the cushion on the floor. so a different feeling from the other karaoke place. and the charge is relatively cheap too. :)  after the singing session, ard 11pm, joseph and i took a train down to clark quay, had a little walk, chatted along the way, all the way to MS, before stopping to eat Bak Kut Teh. hehe. after that found a place to sit down and chatted until around 2.30 before we head for home. overall, a well spent evening.  today was spent packing my stuff... 3 weeks plus in green... time to get use to it again...

      okie, a bit of recap, starting from today. :)   Sunday  I've planned to be at East Coast today. I missed being back at the beach... with the wind blowing, scorching heat from the sun, roller blading kaki by my side... BUT!! It has gotta rain today. of all days of the week, but it chose TODAY!! :( Haiz, spent almost 4 hrs waiting at the cafe waiting for the rain to stop. as every minute passed-by, I felt more disheartening. waited from 1.30pm till 5.00pm. drank two cups of coffee: 1 x cafe mocha and 1 x Vienna coffee. after which we finally decide to leave when it seems futile to wait anymore. made our way down to bugis to catch the movie "The day after tomorrow". It was a good show. but for a person who can't pick out any special meaning from any movie plot. that was all I could say. :P   Saturday  Seems like the whole world is looking for me today. Aylwin asked me to go shopping and movie, CF and Joseph for just movie and an invitation from Alvin to a karaoke session. had to turn down CF for movie cos I already promised to meet Joseph in the evening. met Alywin for a little shopping and lunch at Bugis, left him at 4.30pm. joined Joseph and his colleague for "Shrek 2" and a quick dinner + one game of pool. Left them around 7.30pm. joined Alvin, Jo and Jasmine at Cineleisure for karaoke at 8.15pm and stayed there all the way till 2.30am. Jo sang really well, Jasmine is still good though she has a sore throat and Alvin is really into singing now. hehe. so there is one more singing kaki for me liao. :P The whole day was fun, packed and of cos tiring. my legs were arching from all the walking.   Friday  My last day at work today. Kinda spent my day sorting out the last bit of unfinished task. Handed over all my project and tasks. Finished my last pack of chocolates. At 5.30pm, I handed over my staff pass, smart card, cupboard keys, deleted all my music files from the harddisk, shut down my computer, ... I'm officially "out". My colleagues reserved a table at one of the Muslim restaurant at Prinsep Street. Had my last team dinner with them. It wasn't an expensive dinner with all the good food and stuff, just normal dishes but they sure taste so good, especially to me. Kinda weird. I've learned a lot from this group of colleagues. I'm sad to leave them. but I also know that since I made a decision to go, i can only move forward. And I'm really happy to get their blessing. Especially from Hwee Cheng. She had a major influenced on me and I really appreciate her advice and guidance. She is pregnant with her first baby now. I really wish her and her unborn baby all the best in health. There are a few more person I owe my personal development today, can't really name them all. But I wish them all the best too. From my heart....   Wednesday  Met Joey today for dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Takashimaya. The meal was great. We chatted about our current job, our new job, update each other on what we have been up to, how our mutual friends are faring, etc... There was so much to talk about. After the meal, we took a stroll along Orchard and ended up at Starbucks where we chatted till 11pm before we took the bus back. I went on to join Alvin, William, Jo & Mike (hope I got the name correct) and Jasmine & bf at Zouk. Jasmine & bf are back on holiday from studies in Canada. The last time I saw her was on 30th Aug last year. We had a singing session at Tea Lovers then. That night at Zouk, she was celebrating her birthday. Not a lot of friends turned up partly because it's a Wednesday and most have to work the next day. Karen turned up for a short while but left soon. Stayed there till 2.30pm before going for supper and then back home.   Monday  Met up with Joseph for dinner at Raffles City Food Court. strolled around CityLink for a while, dropped by HMV and bought two CDs, then end up at Pacific Coffee for a cup of coffee and chit chat plus people watching. Tried using the 15mins free internet service but somehow just can't get it working. Gave up after 15mins of fruitless attempt. Chatted till 10.30pm before we left. I like this cafe. It has nice cozy sofa, good ambiance with nice music in the background, and I can do a bit of reading or people watching with a cup of nice hot coffee. =)

      Handed in my last exam answer booklet yesterday at 5.30pm sharp. A sense of relieve overcame me. My fingers were numb from the adrenalin rush (to complete the paper) and the damn cold exam room. Maybe also because i'm hungry. XP  Will be rotting at home today. Hope that the weather will be nice. If not i think i have to go out to escape the heat.

      Eating maggi mee for lunch now. A bit pathetic but i've got no choice.  Took my first paper today at Spring Singapore. I woke up at 8am with sleepy eyes. Wash up and left the house at 8.45am. Bought myself a can of Nescafe Mocha. Just the thing i need to perk me up. Wait for the bus...  The good old bus took 45 mins to get to Bt Merah. Saw a sign, PSB Corporation, outside my window. By the way, Spring Singapore used to be called PSB. Thinking i missed the stop, i quickly got off and walk a good 10 mins back. Upon reaching that building, i got a bad feeling. Firstly, it is a four storey building, my exam is supposed to be on the eigth! Secondly, there is no reception area, not even a security guard for me to check with! Thirdly, there is no "Examination in progress" anyway around the building. I'm dead!! Alarm bells go off in my head. Time, 9.50am, exam starts in 10mins. I quickly got out, ask a school girl at the bus stop if she know the place but hell NO! I'm dead... i'm dead... I tried to scout the area for another 15 mins and that's when i gave up. Took a cab, volla, less than 5 mins to reach. Fare, $2.40! oh man, i've walked the wrong way after i got off the bus. Walked in the exam room at 10.15am. -_-;  Exam paper was HELL!! Damn, but based on the amount of studies i put in, i think i deserve to fail. With two days of studies, ok it's night to be exact, i only managed to read my study guide, 50% of my notes and 0% of my textbook. :(  Wanted to buy a mcdonald fish meal back home for lunch. Quietly queued behind a couple, dig out my wallet, @@!! it's EMPTY!! dig my pocket, out came a $2 dollar note. The change for taxi fare. strange... cos i did recall having two $5 notes when i came out... no choice, went to the nearby ATM to withdraw money. and guess what. the ATM seems to have been vandalised! the slot where one is suppose to insert the ATM card is slotless!! ie, there is no reader machine. sigh... no choice...  so that's why i'm eating maggi mee at home now.  :(  one more paper coming on thursday.

      I like this song.  Hope u like it too.   note to myself: I can make it through the rain. :)   ------------------------------------------------------   When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run  When you're distraught and in pain without anyone  When you keep crying to be saved but nobody comes  And you feel so far away that you just can’t find your way home  You can get there alone  It’s okay, won't you say   I can make it through the rain  I can stand up once again on my own  And I know that I’m strong enough to mend  And every time I feel afraid  I hold tighter to my faith  And I live one more day  And I make it through the rain   And if you keep falling down, don’t you dare give in  You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly  And you’ll find what you need to prevail  Won't you say   I can make it through the rain  I can stand up once again on my own  And I know that I’m strong enough to mend  And every time I feel afraid  I hold tighter to my faith  And I live one more day  And I make it through the rain   And when the wind blows and shadows grow close  Don’t be afraid, there’s nothing you can’t face  And should they tell you, you’ll never pull through  Don’t hesitate, stand tall and say   I can make it through the rain  I can stand up once again on my own  And I know that I’m strong enough to mend  And every time I feel afraid  I hold tighter to my faith  And I live one more day  And I make it through the rain   I can make it through the rain  And stand up once again  And I live one more day and night  I can make it through the rain  Yes you can, you're gona make it through the rain

      oh man, i've spent $431 just on shopping alone this week and another $195.80 on food. now i really got to tighten my purse for this month and here are what i've invested my $$ on: 1) 1 x long sleeve shirt and belt from Wisma G2000, 2) 2 x business pants from Takashimaya, 3) 2 x CK Fragrance from Takashimaya, 4) 1 x Hush Puppy casual shoe from CK Tang, 5) 3 x socks and 2 x boxers from CK Tang.  did i mention that I signed up for practical lessons at Comfort Driving Centre? and that cost me a bomb as well. it set me back by another $700.  4 more weeks to pay day. it's going to be a long wait... :(  here is a picture taken with some of my ex-colleagues in March.

      Been down with a cold for the past three days but i'm getting better. did not snizz for most of the day today. the pack of fisherman&nbsp;never fails to work wonders for me. :)   met up with Joseph today to make payment for our trip to HK. went down to the agency at 1pm and everything was done in a flash. was&nbsp;advised that the agency will contact us to make the final arrangement to pickup the&nbsp;electronic air tickets + let us know of&nbsp;any other instructions. i asked the&nbsp;guy who handled the transaction whether we need to bring along a travel adapter (because we want to bring our handphone charger) but he do not have the answer and told us just bring. hmm... can anyone offer me any advise?   anyway, had lunch at SingPost Mcdonald before heading down to GECL to look for some reference guide to HK. identified&nbsp;two.&nbsp;will return to borrow them again sometime next week. perhaps i will go to bookstore see if i can find the latest copy too.   after that we went down to meet JoJo for a drink after her class.&nbsp; she is free cos&nbsp;Steven is on duty. so we went to Cafe Cartel at PS. food is quite nice. i like my drink too. think is ice coffee with whip cream + caramel topping. in summary, good place to go for dinner but i find the sofa seats pretty dirty. as in i find a lot of food crumps on the seats. think the waiter or waitress simply brush them off the table while clearing up. so if i were to return, i'll just&nbsp;keep to the plastic seats. hehe. we did some people watching too. though i'm sitting facing inward so the only pple i can watch are those in the restaurant. poor Joseph kanna suan by me most of the time today. sorry bro, just joking la. hehe.   after the meal, we accompany Joseph to buy movie tickets for tomorrow's hot date. on the&nbsp;side note, he bought 2 tickets for "Brotherhood" and guess what, the cashier tell him specifically that&nbsp;the&nbsp;friend who is watching with him must&nbsp;be at least 16.&nbsp;wahaha. we&nbsp;concluded that it must have been because JoJo is with him when he bought the ticket. well, no choice lor, cos JoJo&nbsp;has quite a trendy dress sense so pple will think that&nbsp;she is still a "xiao mei mei". hmm, then Joseph has this good boy next door&nbsp;look (not the nerdy kind). and me&nbsp;needless to say, the&nbsp;skinny, plain, non-looker kind. haha.   okie, back to the&nbsp;main topic... joseph's hot date...&nbsp;&nbsp;from what i hear, his date should be quite a nice gal. hope they will get together. hmm... but when that happen, i will have one less kaki to go out with on weekend. :( &nbsp;well, no choice la, as long as he is happy. keke. oh, and i bought Touching Silk by Frank Steiner Jr today. just had to get my hands on it after briefly catching the first few songs being played. didn't had any regrets.&nbsp;oh... i must remember what i promise JoJo. ;)   my ex sec sch schoolmate mum drop by&nbsp;at night&nbsp;to look for my mum. long time since i last saw her since the family moved to BB. mentioned that she has nose cancer (detected one yr ago) but is now recovering. no wonder she looks thinner now. am glad to hear that she is better. hmm long time since i saw her son JM. will need to find a day to maybe catch up with him.   gosh, i must have been away for too long. look at what a long post i wrote (for my own standard). :P

Other than that, i spent the rest of the time at home.&nbsp;   I had something planned in Aug, during the national day weekend.  Will be travelling with Joseph to HK.  Had our tickets and our hotel&nbsp;booked this morning.  Hope to catch up with a friend while i'm there. :)
