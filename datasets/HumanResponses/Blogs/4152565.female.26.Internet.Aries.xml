      Okay, okay, so I'm on an astrology kick. I've studied astrology for years, but I phase in and out of interest over time - come to think of it, I'm like that with everything. The same site I posted yesterday has a section on  urlLink Chinese astrology . I think it's great fun to get together as many different traditions and compare the differences and similarities between them. Give it a try!

      This is a site I visit daily.  urlLink Astrology.com  is a very informative site for anyone wanting to learn more about the way stars influence us. You can even have your  urlLink horoscope e-mailed to you daily  for free! From  urlLink this page , you can check out your daily, weekly, or monthly horoscope in different areas like work, romance, etc. They have entire groups of pages (mini-sites) for each sign! For example: here's  urlLink Aries Central . Some of the features on their site cost money, but there's enough free stuff to keep you busy for a while!

      Okay, now most of you know what sign you are in traditional European astrology right? I'm an Aries. Some of you even know what your sign is according to Chinese astrology (horse for me. But very few people are familiar with the Celtic tradition. Here's a very informative site on  urlLink Celtic astrology . It's a system based on trees - I found out that I'm an  urlLink Alder . My associated animals are the fox, bear and hawk. My flower is broom (never seen it) and my gemstone is ruby. Kind of a fun site.

      Today is the dark of the moon. That point between cycles when we can't see her shining face. The moon is also travelling through the constellation of leo right now. This combination gives us a new outlook - a fresh perspective on life. The time is right to begin projects that have to do with the general public. I found this interesting application that you can put on your website for free - I'm thinking of adding it in the future. It shows a photo of the moon in it's current phase and updates itself each day. Neat huh?  urlLink Here's the link .

      I was looking for resources to write an article for our upcoming  urlLink newsletter  when I happened upon this  urlLink sleep test . I figure there must be other people out there with similar problems, so go check it out. The results, of course, are not to be taken in place of a doctor's diagnosis, but they might give a head's up if needed.  urlLink This site  also has some very valuable information regarding the need for sleep.

      OK, it's pretty well common knowledge that carbon dioxide emissions are becoming a major problem with our atmosphere. Recently, Susanna Taco, a massage therapist from Florida e-mailed me with a product inquiry. I was particularily interested in her signature links. One link was to her  urlLink organic massage website  which highlights the beneifts of going organic - I wish she worked her magic up here in Canada! The other link was to  urlLink Future Forests , an organization devoted to the reduction of CO2 emissions.  Future Forests has a  urlLink great page on CO2 reduction tips , from which I have learned that electricity emits CO2. The less electricity we use, the more money we save so it just makes sense to save the earth!

      There have been a few customers who seem concerned about the chemically-laden world we live in. Luckily, there are many groups who are actively fighting against the FDA to ban certain substances from common use in food and cosmetics. One of these groups is  urlLink Not Too Pretty , an organization specifically focused on the banning of phthalates. Phthalates are proven to cause damage to the liver, the kidneys, the lungs and the reproductive system - particularly developing testes. They can hurt unborn babies and they are primarily used in products made for women (something is seriously wrong with this world). They are used as plastic softeners and solvents in a variety of products including hair spray, deodorant, nail polish, perfume and a whole lot of other stuff we use every day without batting an eye. Not Too Pretty also has a way for you to  urlLink take action , so give them a visit and spread the word!  At  urlLink Valhalla Essences , we will not use any chemicals in our products - ever.

      Just thought I would introduce the gang around here. My other half, Bruce, is very camera shy, so I won't be posting his picture. Bruce loves to build things - any things! He's an excellent cook, an avid bodybuilder and loves to ride his motorcycle as much I do. Bruce is very supportive when I have to work long hours and he even pitches in when he can.     Here's our resident hunter/adventurer - Toed. He aquired his name when he spent his first night with us jumping on our faces and biting our noses. We would wake up cursing at him and calling him a little toad. He also has extra toes on his front paws, so toad became toed and it stuck. (He's a very gentle, lovey cat now).       This is Turkey - no we didn't name him. A friend of ours had Turkey given to him near the same time we acquired Toed. They were the same age and our friend couldn't keep Turk, so we adopted him too. This is pretty much what he does all day - unless food is around!       The only other girl in the house - this is Chile. She is ten months old and we rescued her from the pound when she was three months. She has adapted very well to her new home and is a normal, happy-go-lucky pup. She is half German Shepard and half Rhodesian Ridgeback (African lion hunting dogs). She helps round up the cats when it's time to go in for the night. She also gets a third of the bed.

       Hello and welcome to my very first blog. I have recently launched an online business ( urlLink www.valhallaessences.com ) and I hope to use this blog to show visitors that a real person runs Valhalla Essences. I live in beatiful British Columbia, Canada in a tiny little town called Tappen (we're talking blink and you'll miss it). I love about a million things including photography.     Wild tiger lilies - aren't they pretty? This picture was taken in the back yard of my mother and father in-law. It can now be seen featured on the cover of the Valhalla Essences August 2004 catalog.
