       Yo yo my peeps.&nbsp; Thanks for checking out my blog.&nbsp; This is my first one.&nbsp; Yessirree.&nbsp; So today me and my fam went to Guilford and other towns on the CT ocean border.&nbsp; It was cool.&nbsp; I went to one of the Old Glory stores 15 minutes before closing, so I didn't have much time to look around, but i didn't see anything that caught my eye anyway, so it was alright...&nbsp; We went to the Guilford marina, and sat on the shoreline for about half an hour.&nbsp; It was really calm and nice..&nbsp; We could see the Lawng Awland Sound [sic](what does that mean?)&nbsp;35 miles away (which my dad found out from the guy at the office).&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; Then we had supper at Lenny and Joe's and I got a t-shirt for $5, so that satisfied my t-shirt fix for the day.&nbsp; Had clam chowdah, fried shrimp, and fries there, DELICIOUS.&nbsp; All in all it was a good day trip, and I'm happy.&nbsp; Well, I have to go, I've got my final driving lesson tomorrow at 10, so I'm hitting the sack.&nbsp; I'll catch ya'll on the flip side.&nbsp; See ya in the next blog.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -The Philibuster

       Hey ya'll.  Back again to tell you about my fantastic 2nd year at the Litchfield Jazz Festival Summer Music School.  It WAS  AWESOME , again.  I learned sooo much, and had soooo much fun, just like last year.  It was so awesome, and I would CERTAINLY reccommend it to anyone.  And I mean ANYONE.  Well, anyone that knows how to play an instrument.  And certainly EVERYONE in the whole world should listen to jazz.  It is such a broad musical genre, it has something for everyone, and you can't really correctly define it.  And the blues is a major part of it.  Sooo, anyone who doesn't listen to jazz, start.  Please.  Think of the children.  But really, get some stuff by Miles Davis (if you haven't heard of him) or Charlie Parker (ditto) or Dizzie Gillespie (also ditto).  They are some of the greatest jazz artists of all time.  I personally like Davis and Herbie Hancock.  It's all good stuff.  Just search around and I'm sure you'll find something that you'll like.  The Festival was GREAT this year, just like last year (except no Soulive [boooo]).  Well, I've got a semi-busy day tomorrow so keep on keepin' on and Phillyboy will catch ya'll on the flipside.                                                                                                           -Peace
