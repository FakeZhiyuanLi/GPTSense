      [Currently listening to: Pennywise - what if i]  I wish I could drive... If I could tomorrow I would drive to Las Vegas to go see Yellowcard and Something Corporate in concert. It's not far. Anyways, its Spring Break and the two plans I had were both canceled. I was supposed to go to California with a bunch of friends on a school trip but it has been moved to next month. Then I planned on going to Flagstaff, AZ. Eight foot base on the mountain and fresh powder, 65 degrees. Could the conditions be better? No. But no snowboarding for me. This whole week I have to babysit. 10 hour days, and for the whole week I am only getting fifty bucks. I am too much of a doormat to ask for more money from a single parent. So far this weekend, I went golfing, and got sun burned. I hate golf, but my Dad is convinced I am going to join the LPGA. Ofcourse, he also thinks that someday I am going to be the first woman to win gold at the X-Games for motocross. He used to race, and he was actually good. There is a reason we have a trophy room in our house. [Currently listening to : Less than Jake - Johnny Quest thinks we're sell outs.]

      My last post was dumb. read this. or don't. doesn't matter.   I go to school a lot. I take 12 classes a day, with one free hour to eat dinner. get there at 7 in the morning, leave at 8 at night. Everyday. But I like it, actually. It's fun, I have a lot of friends that are in my classes and they are all good classes. Except for two. I got a writing teacher that is really a clerk in a supermarket and my social studies teacher is a coctail waitress ata casino. We had an argument the other day. She thought Sputnik was the first atomic bomb. I gave up but the next day I slipped a print out from the internet about Sputnik in her box in the teachers lounge. I don't know how she reacted because I missed the whole week of school. I was really sick but I wanted to go to school anyway. My Dad made me stay home because he thinks I am working myself to the sick point.  Chickens  My Mom had her midlife crisis. She's 49. She's going to live a looong time. She bought a bunch of chickens. They live in our backyard now. They have a huge coop that is in the way of me getting my car out. It's a '78 Mercedes. Red. But its never going to leave the backyard unless I get a crane because its stuck between the wooden fence and the giant coop. We have 22 chickens. We are killing one tomorrow. I am happy though. I hate that rooster. He bites and he has drawn blood on me before. I picked out a recipe for him months ago. I have picked out recipes for all of our chickens. I wanted to give them names, but my Mom said I would get too attatched. I named them recipes. Now I'm not attatched.

      Today was Saturday. I had to babysit again. I babysit every Saturday of my life but I didn't the whole month of February. The girl had Softball and her Dad wanted to go, and one of the weeks I went to Las Vegas with my friends for a Billy Talent/MxPx/Sugarcult concert and a visit to a theme park. I wish I could do that every weekend instead of babysit. But I need the money, so hey. My parents went out to their friends 50th birthday party. I had nothing to do so I watched the movie Frequency(I recommend it!) and I went outside and skated around the block a few times. It isn't really a good idea to skate around my neighborhood at ngiht, but I wasn't thinking. There's no street lights and a lot of homeless people and a bar. Plus it must be a Mexican Holiday or something. The whole street is awake and playing music from their cars. Should I end this post? I have nothing else to say. Except, who is reading this? I wonder who will actually find this journal and read it. If someone I know read it it would be weird.

      Home Burglary    I was sitting in English class at about 3:00pm last Thursday. It was really quiet, my class was working on essays. But the door slamming open broke the silence and Dylan came running into the classroom. Mrs. Pelletier was obviously irritated and looked up, prepared to kick him out of the classroom. "*Blua*! You're house got broken into and Alex is in the office and he's like crying!" Dylan likes to joke a lot, but I could tell he was serious. My brother Alex is one of his best friends and my best friends little brother, and he wouldn't think this was funny. I left my backpack by my desk and didn't even pick up my essay and notebook. "Mrs. Pelletier, I have to go!" So I left, without a goodbye, my friends sitting shocked back in the classroom. I ran to the office, probably the fastest I had run in a long time. Dylan was still behind me. I got in the office and I saw Alex sitting in a chair, slumping with bad posture and tears in his eyes. He jumped up immediately, and said "Blua*! I went home at 2:45 after my school got out and I didn't notice it at first, but when I came out of the bathroom I saw! I thought it was a hoax at first, but it was real!" I had no idea what he was talking about, he was just babbling on. I told him to tell me what happened. "Everything is gone! My XBOX, the computers, a whole bunch of stuff!" I hadn't realized that there was a busy school office around me until now. Parents waiting to pick up their children, kindergarteners, and school secretaries stood around watching. My favorite secretary, La Vonne handed me a phone from somewhere to my left. She had already dialed the police non-emergency number. I told them my address, name, and phone number, and then handed the phone to my brother to explain what happened. He talked for a few minutes, while the office was completely silent. He said that the police would be at our house in a few minutes. I was ready to go to my house, but Rachel, my friend's Mom and an office worker, said she would meet us there in a few minutes. Me and my brother just left, saying we would see her there. It only takes a minute to get to my house from school. It was weird walking into my house knowing it would look different. Before stepping in the door I looked around the front yeard. The wooden fence we used to have was down, and a block wall had been slowly going up all week. This was probably the reason we were robbed. People could finally see the yard behind the fence, and saw stuff they wanted. My brother opened the door before I was ready to see it. He was talking loudly and pointing, but things didn't seem very different. He had said before that the house was trashed and everything was gone. It didn't look that different. I walked across the tile of the Living room. Then I notice the computer desks. Both computer towers were gone, and the drawers of the desks were obviously gone through. I looked inside my bedroom. I was shocked ot see that my DVD player was missing, my electric scooter was gone, and I found my cash box empty.$140.00 dollars I had been saving for weeks was now gone. My parents room was a disaster. All their belongings had ended up on the floor somehow, and ?lightbulbs? were all over the place. I heard a knock at the door and freaked out, until I realized that it was of course, Rachel. She came in and started talking to my brother.I noticed that I had not seen my dogs. "Buffy! Zoe!" I was screaming and running through rooms. I went back into my room. They had both been in there. Buffy was hidng under the covers and pillows of my bed, and Zoe was in the far corner of underneath the bed. The were happy to see me but afraid to come out of their hiding places. I put their leashes on, and Rachel took them outside. She said we shouldn't go through the house anymore because we might disturb evidence. We waited outside for the police for a long time. No it wasn't long, only 5 minutes. During this time I called my parents at work and told them what had happened. They were on their way home. A cop car drove by three times, My brother trying to catch it's attention by going in the street and waving his arms. But the cop couldn't seem to figure it out. He eventually pulled up to the house, and I started thinking that the cop was really stupid.  My brother and I toured him through the house, he made notes, gave us forms to give to our parents, etc. He took the game case of one of my brothers XBOX games, but couldn't get any prints off of it. He tried taking fingerprints off of the gun cabinet, also. Nothing was found. My parents arrived, and they took over. I dont remember what I did, but I think I went into my room and looked at it. It was completly ransacked, clothes and books all over the floor. At some point I decided to go back to school. I found my friends and we had a free hour and drove to Quizno's Subs and got something to eat. We took our food and went to the park. We swung on swings like little kids, tried to fit down the slides, and went down the hill to the river and skipped rocks. I felt better. Now its Wednesday, almost a week later. I'm home sick, and kind of depressed. The fact that someone went through my house and stuff is very violating. The realization that someone has the power to take away material things so easily is scary. If you are reading this, I didn't expect you too. I didn't think anyone would read it until the end.

      Lysistrata  UPDATED SATURDAY, 03 APRIL 2004 03:36:41  [Currently listening to: television in the backround]  [Lingering thought: I just read the greek comedy "Lysistrata" for my Independent Studies English Literature Class. For the first feminist writing ever, it was pretty sick]  Today was Friday. I have no school on Fridays, but for some reason I always find myslef there anyways. I had a teen task force meeting about getting meth off the streets of my city. It's a really huge problem around here. My school has been broken into twice this year by people on meth. One robbery was by a homeless man, one was by two of our own students. And, last week just one street over a house was raided for meth and the inhabitants are now in jail.  The meeting was at 9am, and I had another recycling meeting at 1pm. Somehow I wasted away all of those hours in between the two meetings at school and at McDonald's. I dont know how though, I can't remember doing anything terribly important. It's amazing how long and busy my days are but nothing seems to happen...  We held our recycling meeting at an italian restuarant. We set up plans for the rest of the day. However, the conversation drifted as it always does and we ended up laughing so hard and loud that I am surprised we were not kicked out of D'Angelo's. One of the subjects was what Mr. O thinks we will be when we grow up. Mr. O teaches Phys Ed at my school and is the one who presented the business idea to us. According to him, someday I am going to teach college. Sydney will compete in dog shows and flower shows. Brandy will teach Math at a highschool and coach the girls basketball team afterschool. CJ will own a gun shop and not care in the least if anyone actaully buys his guns. Jessica will be a girl scout leader, a softball coach and a beautician.  The rest of the day we traveled in our ugly small school bus to businesses to see where we could put recycling bins. We did not make ourselves known, we were just looking. Next week we will approach the business to places bins at their locations. We made it as fun as we could, sticking our heads and hands out the bus windows and waving to people on the streets. We waved to all kinds of people, including a biker who had his motorcycle loaded up with garden tools. We waved to an old woman at the post office and probably made her day. We told a women who was having her car pushed by a group of guys to "have a nice day" and accidentally went to fast around and splashed a bum with rain water from a puddle. Really, it was an accident and we felt really bad.

      Mom's chickens have gone broody, meaning they are sitting on eggs. Its crazy, there are baby chicks hatching all over the place.  Well this has been a busy week. School's almost out and the teachers are really loading on the work. Yesterday was Thursday, and during lunch my friends and I went to eat lunch at our usual table. Only problem, on the table in huge, black, permanent marker it said "Tori is B**** W****" We all knew who wrote it. Later, word had gotten around school that Tori found the writing and that if someone was going to say something, to say it to her face. The girl who wrote it came up to Tori as lunch was ending, and got right in her face. There were two inches in between their faces, and the girl said "So you want to say soemthing to me?" Tori stepped back, not taking her seriously and said "I'll say that you need a breath mint". Tori started to laugh, but in mid-laugh the girls fist came out of nowhere and hit her in the cheek. The girl pushed Tori against one of the lunch tables and started kicking Tori in the face and punching her in the chest. Tori pulled herself up and started fighting back, but by then dozens of kids and teachers had got between them and broke it up. *** Update *** The girl who attacked Tori is now on probation, and Tori has a proabationary hearing ina few weeks. She is innocent, and we have the school nurse ot confirm that there were no injuries to the girl, but Tori had a busted lip and bruises on the face that lasted a few days. *** The worast thing about the whole ordeal was that Tori had cheerleading tryouts that night. She made the Junior Varsity Team, even though she was bleeding and purple.

      [Currently listening to: Social Distortion - Ball and chain, on album Social Distortion, 1990]  Yesterday was Friday ALREADY. Most people welcome Frdiays, but I dread them. It's a sign of another week that I got no school work accomplished. And there are only two Fridays left! Ah! I went to school at 7:00am and Tori, Jessica and I went into the computer lab and started working immediately on our Government work. Oh, if there is anything worse than working all day on a book that talks about how wonderful the Government is. Uh. Sydney walke dinto the room at about 9:00 am. jessica looked over and asked "What are you doing here?" not rude, just a question. She has no work to do or anything. But she took it the wrong way and ran out of the room crying. I felt bad for her, but there was nothing anybody could do about it. You can sneeze wrong and she bursts into tears.  And now for the explanation of my title. There was teachers meeting today and one of the teachers brought a baby she was watching for the day. After the meeting, she was changing the baby's diaper, when all of a sudden it stopped breathing. I was at home eating lunch at the time, so I am glad I missed this. The baby turned as purple as grape people were saying. The art teacher (what a troll of a woman she is) pushed everyone aside and insisted on doing CPR. Two people in the crowd knew CPR. She was not one of them, but she decided she was going to do it. Dylan ran and got Stephanie (Tori Dylan and David's mom, and my teacher). She knows CPR. The ambulance came and took the baby. Later that day we found out it was okay. I don't know any further news on it.  I got a prom dress from Tori Friday, too. But I am so white I decided I needed a tan. Stephanie asked Tori and me if we wanted to go to the lake. Who wouldn't? So we went and got Tori's boyriend Zach and her brother David. We invited Brandy and we all went to the Lake for a couple of hours. It was a hundred degrees but the water was freezing, so no one went in the water above the ribs.

      Mr. O just let us go free in the mall. He told us to meet him back at the school vans at 7:30pm. No supervision. What was he thinking? Letting 12 kids aged 12 through 15 loose in a mall. Smart move...  Well, anyways, Peter is very racist. White Supremecy and all that. We were getting Orange Juliuses in the food court when Peter nearly got into a fight. Right in front of us, a black girl in a wheelchair had went up to a bunch of black guys and asked them for their numbers. They spit on her, laughed and walked away.  Peter is only 5 foot and three inches (six foot something with the mohawk). But he decided he was gonna say something to those guys who had been so rude to the girl, who was now crying. His brother held him back and talked him out of it, but it was really close.  Okay, lets skip ahead a few days. Its the last day of the trip in Phoenix and we are on our way home. Pulling out of a gas station, Mr.O's girlfriend makes a U turn in the middle of the highway. I got it on camera. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was the fourth near-accident of the trip.  That's the first reason Mr. O is being investigated. Letting kids ride with someone who is not covered by the school's insurance. And the fact that she is illegally in the US and she does not have a drivers License. The second : remember my friends who didn't stay in their beds that night? Well...yeah. They didn't do anything serious (they would have but she was on her period), but he woke up with a hUgE hickey that morning.  Maybe teenagers should not be allowed on school trips? no way, its too fun.

      May 8 Last weekend I went on a trip to phoenix with my phys ed teacher Mr. O and about 12 kids from my school. The other kids were there to take the PT Test with 100 soldiers, and I came to video-tape it. Apparently I am very good with the camera.  During our stay we had to eat MREs, (Meals Ready to Eat). If you have never heard of these, your lucky. They are preserved meals that are packed in heavy plastic and are supposed to last 5-10 years on the the battlefield. I have a feeling that they are kept around longer... Eating the MREs were quite an experience.  It was a fun trip, except we only had two chaperones. We were staying at the home of the Uncle of our PE teacher. He was a nice old man. But *Mr. O* actually thought that having the guys sleep outside and the girls sleeping inside would work out. The only thing separating us was a sliding glass door. I stayed where I was supposed to, but lets just say that 2 of my friends did not.  We were staying an hour away form the base, so we had to get up at 3 am every single day to make the drive and be at the base at 5 am. It was the kind of trip where you hurry-up-and-wait. We spent near;y 3 whole days hanging around at the base. Mr.O had duty with the ARMY, so it was just our one chaperone, *Cindy* and our PE tecaher MR O*'s girlfriend.  His girlfriend came in their personal truck. Last time they were in Phoenix she rolled it down an embankment. But she insisted that we get out of the base and go somewhere. So kids had to ride with her, in the back of a half smashed pick up.  I refused ot ride with her, and rode with Cindy*. We went to Freestone Skate Park, and I think I got enough footage their to make a skate video. Thats gonna be awesome. We spent all day their, then went back to base to get Mr.O, and went to the house.  That night we were really bored so Lyle (I can't remember what fake name i gave him...) decided to do his twin brother Peters hair. Peter has long hair that he usually wears ina mohawk. We spiked up huge and then heard we were going to the Metro Center Mall in Phoenix.  This was fun because while we all walked through the mall, everyone stopped and stared at Peter's hair. It was hilarious. ah-gtg-mom's home cant finsh this post she doesn't know why mr o is being investigated----

      UPDATED FRIDAY, 07 MAY 2004 20:31:11  The next day I came to school half an hour early. I was almost excited to see what my punishment would be.About 9:00 am I was called into *Marie's* office. She started out by talking about what I did. I lead a revolt of the students, challenged the authority of my teacher, and disrupted the learning environment of others...blah blah blah...  She asked why did it, why I didn't give him a chance, etc. Except when she asked me a question, she answered it. Then gave my some of her life philosophy. Every single question. It was so fruststrating. I wanted to explain myself.  You see, my school is really messed up. I am very involved in it, and whenever I have a problem with a teacher I go to the office. They are always VERY valid complaints. I usually have a meeting with Marie, or I write a note. I am never biased, I am not causing trouble for the sake of causing trouble. She knows me well, she knows that not why I was doing this. So why wouldn't she just let me answer the questions?  Somehow I spent and hour and 15 minutes in her office, and I don't remember much of what she said. My only punishment was that I have to apologize to everyone that I hurt, and help Dr. in anyway possible. That's it.  The 20 other kids that walked have to write a 3 page essay about peer influences and an apology to DR Larry. But me, as the "ringleader" I got hardly nothing.  Except I did get a weeks worth of extra chores form my parents. lol

      May 6  This is something I have always wanted to do. read on... you will wish you had done it once... the best thing, I got away with it.  My Algebra Class got it's fourth new teacher this year. We got him on Monday. It's now Friday. He has a Phd. and we have to call him Doctor. DO NOT make the mistake of calling him Mr...  He has some teaching method that has made him some huge hit in his college classes, and he wants to apply it to highschool. The way he explained, it sounded great. It wasn't.  It was just his third day of teaching, but already I could not stand him. He talked quietly, he quizzed us daily, and could not explain to us the math problems on the board. He just put up the problem and the answer and expected us to understand. I'm a straight A student, and two days in a row I had failed my daily quiz, and so had everyone in the class except the four in the corner.  The four kids in the corner are the only ones he helps. They are the anime kids, they have a "clan". I don't understand them, but I know I like them. This girl, Jincy, is going somewhere someday. She can draw so awesome... Next year she wants to be a foreign exchange student in Japan and learn to be a manga. She's cool. Anyways...  Dr. was helping them like usual. I looked around at my friends. We were sitting in the back, hands raised, some standing up, trying to get his attention. "Paging Dr. Larry, Paging Dr. Larry, Ronnie needs help!" Ronnie said over his CD player blaring Anti-flag into his ears. I couldn't stand it. I need to get out of the classroom. So I walked up and left. Dr. didn't notice the door open and shut.  It was about 100 degrees out, so I found a classroom to go into. It was was social studies and I hung out in there with Peter, Angela, Alexa and Lyle for about 15 minutes. Angela was playing Pennywise on her guitar and Lyle was trying to put his twin Peter's Mohawk into Liberty Spikes. No one had the right kind of hairspray or a blowdryer, so the attempt was failing.I had to go back to class I decided, so I forged a note from the nurse and went back to class. Dr. didn't notice me walk in. I went to hand him the "nurses note" but he shooed my away. I crumbled it up and went back to my desk. More time of the class passed, and still he did not explain what was going on. Then I had an idea. I knew that the school was not going to listen to my class when we complained about a new teacher. I had done it before, and they never cared. So we had to do something radical.  I went to every kid in the class and whispered something in their ear. Dr didn't notice. When Dr. Larry went up to the board to give us the daily quiz, I stood and raised both my arms in the air. Everyone except the four that understood grabbed their backpacks. I pointed at the door, and 20 students began walking towards the door. Dr. Larry stayed at the board looking at his notes with a scrunched up face. He didn't notice.  We walked in a large group out the door. Then I took the lead and everyone followed me to the office. We stepped inside the office lobby, and the secretaries gave us a funny look. We knew where we were going, and without knocking everyone went into Mrs. T*'s office. She had been our first math teacher of the year, and was one of the school principals.  Kelsey* took the lead from here and explained to Mrs. T* why Dr. couldn't teach. She nodded her head but still looked surprised that 20 students were in her small office. She told us to go back to class and the complaint would be investigated.  Except, we didn't go back to class. Our group went into Social Studies. The teacher in there let us stay, as long as we didn't disrupt her "class". It's the end of the year and we have finished the required curriculum so its pretty much free time in there. Angela was still working on "Bro Hymn Tribute" by Pennywise in the corner, her amp plugged in next to a blow dryer that has appeared from somewhere. Peter is now looking a foot taller with his hawk up in liberty spikes.

      spelling fa H renheit wrong all these years  So, we went to see fa h renheit 911 last night. and it was excellent. i laughed, I almost cried, i was entertained, and i learned some stuff. well no, i didn't, but... i already knew about the ties between the dubyas and the bin ladens, and i already knew everything about halliburton and enron and the carlyle group, but still, i liked it. And it was biased. didn't you expcet that anyways? as we were leaving some old guy was preaching about how everyone in the world should see it. well, no, i think it should be available to everyone who wants to see it. thats why michael moore is not-so-secretly telling people to bring cameras to the theatres. he doesn't want money, he wants the exposure. and he's getting lots of exposure on kazaa.    if it wasn't for my horse i wouldn't have spent that year in college-lewis black

      i know people hate reading about dreams, but this one doesn't have to much to do with my dream. i was dreaming that i was running with my cross country team. i was making fun of my friends shirt, because it was paris hilton shirt, and i said really loud "paris hilton is a trash whore" when we passed a , well, trash-whore (with pink hair). the next person we passed was a fat sscraggly looking guy. me and my friend laughed and sped up as we passed him, but he reached out and grabbed me. the moment he grabbed me in my dream, my dog jumped up on my bed, enough to wake me partially. i thought that she was the guy attacking me, and i went totally tae-kwon do one her. when i was awake all the way, she was lying on the floor, and wouldn't come near me for about half an hour.

Peter: No no Lois, it's time I joined the ranks of great men with beards. Why do you think Jesus Christ was so popular? Cause ... cause of all the magic tricks?  Peter: I'm not afraid of anything, I laugh in the face of Death. See HAHAHAHA. Death: Oh great! Thanks a lot. As if it wasnt already hard enough to fit in.   Lois: Peter, why would they make you presidesnt? Peter: Maybe it's because I can recite all 50 states in a quarter of a second - RARF! Lois: Peter, that was just a loud yelping noise.   okay. im done ;)

      I had a stupid idea last night while not sleeping to put two earrings in one earring hole. Now I have a big red puffy infected ear. What an idiot. :) The point is that last night I had insomnia again. I've never been a normal sleeper, but I would give anything to be able to lay down and fall asleep immeadiately. My Mom claims that she falls asleep after laying there for like 5 minutes. Thats insane. I lay in my bed for about an hour, hour and a half until i sleep. So, last night I couldnt sleep and i decided that I would sleep in the bathtub. Yes, that right, I said the tub. I didnt put water in it or anything like that, I put my bed spread in the bottom to make it soft, added a pillow and a fleece blanket, and it was nice, I slept. But i woke up around 4 and went into my bed. I didnt stay there long, i woke up at 6 when mom was up and helped her with chicken chores and dishes. and now im awake. as always. Oh, heres what my ear looks like with double earrings. kinda cool.kinda blurry.

      so, my brother steals the cool whip when i take it out of the freezer, no one likes frozen cool whip. I chase him around the hosue, look like an idiot infront of the whole neighborhood, and he locks me out. Luckily, i had my digital camera in my pocket. heres a picture of alex being an absolute loser, jeering at me through the open window.

      It was the coolest thing ever. Thats all i have to say. My mom and me were on our way to the newspaper office, just a normal day. But, we couldn't pull out of the driveway because there were cops driving down the road everywhere. There were police cars circling the block around my house, I could see them on other streets from behind the houses. There were K9 unit cars, and normal marked cars. I saw two unmarked cars coming (how can you tell an unmarked car? lol they have these huge lights hanging off the windows, plus you can see the police lights above the dash in the front window). We had finally made it out of the driveway and were driving down the road when the marked car behind us stopped in the middle of the road, and an officer came running out of the drivers side. He was holding a huge gun ( my brother told me later that it was an AK-47), and he ran to the apartment building across the street from my house. My mom was freaking out and wouldn't shut up about bullet ricochet into our house, or something like that. I was reaching around for my camera and pulling the door open, thinking "Okay, i can sell the footage to channel 2 to use for the 6 o clock news today, and later i'll send it into real tv if its good enough". But ofcourse, i realized that i did not, infact, have my camera, so had to put my seatbelt back on and give up. Oh, i was so pissed. =)  "i didn't mean for this to take on a political tone, i'm just here for the drugs." - nancy reagan, former first lady

      I have spent the last three days changing my template, and discovered that I don't like what I have created. So then I chose one of the pre-made templates. Great. Now my blog looks like I am too stupid to make my own template. I am not happy with it at all. I slept last night! From about midnight tile 9 am. Its great. I forgot what it felt like to be awake. Its nice.  stay out of the road, if you want to grow old -pink floyd

       	  Tomorrow will be a fairly busy day. I have to go to a birthday party, held at the most happening place in town, the elks lodge? But before that, i have to pick up my prom dress from the dry cleaners and return it to Tori. I also have to try and get my bicycle that i loaned to Chelsea. Actually, its not my bike. Its my brothers custom bmx bike, and im in a lot of trouble over it. Oh, and I have to go to the feed store thats out in the valley with my mom, becasue we have to buy enough chicken feed to last the chickens all summer while we are gone, my uncle kevin is watching the house. anyways. my brother is on the other side of the livingroom, trying to read this from a distance. He thinks this is a bad site, lol. I finally got my gmail account. its storyoftheyear@gmail.com, if anyone wants to know.  night.

      Okay, so its a little after 4:30 in the am, and I'm finally tired. I go into my room, lay down, and what do i hear? The frickin rooster is already crowing. aww...geez.... anyways, just thought i would say that.   AND  does anybody out there know much about windows. I disowned it a bit ago, and is it humanly POSSIBLE to delete rundll? My Mom thinks she deleted it off of our newest XP machine. Long Story short - the internet won't work on it(not that IE ever does), and its way slow(more than usual, i mean). I guess thats what you get when you think youre freeing up space and delete things, isn't that right dear mother... god, she should be locked up. :)?

      Well, I just transfered the posts from my old journal/blog that was on opera.com (the web browser, NOT the music..). Whoa.. I just heard the gravel crunch outside the house. I am in the livingroom on the Lindows computer. Could that be last nights visitor? My Dad tried to tell me that it was a coyote last night, not a person. Okay, now I'm worried like usual. Damn, I get so paranoid when I'm tired. I hate insomnia.

      Scary Hobo, and someone creeping around the yard  Ugh! My Mom was able to get an early vacation this summer! That means more time at the summer house in Minnesota, which is great. But we are leaving Bullhead July 3rd. That means that July 4th I will be somewhere on the Highway in Albuquerque or Denver, NOT at the Warped Tour! No Story of the Year, No NoFx, No Bouncing Souls or Coheed and Cambria for me. I am so pissed.   Anyways, its 2 in the morning. Again. The night before last, I stayed up all night. Didn't sleep at all. But, I did manage to get a gmail account. Ofcourse, I havent signed up for it yet because this computer runs lindows, and its browser wont load the java buttons, even though java is enabled. I should probably download opera for this computer after I'm done ranting here.   Then, last night, I was having a really scary dream, but thats not why I woke up at 3 am. In the dream I was on a trip with the same people that went to Phoenix, we were in Mr. O's truck, and someone kept crashing into us on purpose. Wherever the car hit in a place where you would think it would kill the person, it wouldn't ; they would just disappear. The window wasn't open, they didn't fly out, there was no blood, they were just gone. Finally we made it to safety at the school. The remaining of my friends and me went into the school office, only to find everyone that had disappeared. They were dead in the office, messy, ugly,bloody dead. Usually, when I have bad dreams, I concentrate to change them, make them a good dream. but I was rudely interrupted by something that woke me up. I don't know what, but I sprang awake at 3:03am. I lay awake, still shaking off my dream, and this creepy feeling I wasn't alone. I thought someone was outside, but I told myself that I was just still jumpy from the dream.  My dog started growling at the doggy door in my room, but wouldn't go out. I just sat in my bed, not moving, aware of the huge window without curtains that covers the entire length of my bed. the rooster started crowing, repeatedly, he would not stop. I layed in my bed for 2 hours. I can't believe that much time passed, but I had a strange suspicion that someone was out there, and I didn't want to find out.  I watched the sky from my window. It slowly turned green, then blue, and then mountains started to turn pink. After being a coward in my bed for 2 hours, I decided to get up. I put my hair up and running shoes on, and grabbed my cell phone so I could go for a jog before I ate breakfast. It was nice and cool out, the coldest I had felt the weather for 2 months, about 80 degrees. I jogged up my street, to my school, and decided to go up the steep hill up to my other old school. It was about a mile and a half jog, and it was nice. I was coming down the hill to my house when I saw Safari Suit Bum in the alley. I see this man everyday, he dresses in a khaki suit that is Crocodile Hunter-esque. He walks around the neighbohood with his long beard, never talking to anyone. But today, he whistled at me.  I wasn't sure it was him, I thought maybe it was the mexican man I had just passed, but when I looked behind me, Safari Suit Bum was a few feet behind where I was,dancing. Not just regular dancing, but the CHICKEN DANCE. I had never seen anything stranger in my life. I was to surprised to be scared, as I ran into the house. Once I was inside the fatigue of the running had stopped, but my heart was still beating. What a weird morning.  The sun still hadn't quite risen, so I took the dogs for a walk to the beach, after I was sure Safari Suit Bum had turned the corner to a different street. Later during breakfast I asked my Mom if Safari Suit Bum had ever talked to her. She said yes he had, things like "Hey Babe" and "hi hot mama".  Its a good thing I run a different route everytime. And, I always keep my cell dialed to 911. All I have to do is hit send.

      Well, school is finally out. Really, actually out. The Senior Graduation was held on Tuesday Night, and I went to see all my friends graduate. Some of them were happy, like Brandy, Zach and Francisco. But David was pissed about graduating, you could tell as he accepted his diploma. I have a feeling that's how I am going to feel about graduating a year early. I know that I will want to stay in school and not want to grow up.  Tomorrow I am supposed to go floating down the river with Chelsea, Abby, Jessica, Zach, Tori, David, Ashley and Gerald. I really want to go, Floating is so much fun. For those of you that don't live near rivers, floating is where you get a bunch of inflatable mats (we are using fake turtles this time) and time them all together. Everyone gets on a mat and you float down the river, starting at the dam, and usually ending somewhere like a park or a restuaraunt. Tomorrow we will stop at the landing near Chelsea's house.  Well, goodbye for now, I finally have hours of free time and no idea how to spend it. I guess I will study some Esperanto.

      hey thats cool, i heard its been raining a lot there! I can't wait to get to Minnesota, i love the rain. it rained for the first time in 4 months on ...was it Thursday? I was so excited i went outside and took pictures of the rain drops on the sidewalk. by the time i had put the pictures on the computer and came back outside for more pics (about 5-10 minutes) it was done raining the clouds were leaving over the mountains. it wasn't even enough to keep the dirt wet for a few minutes. we went to the fireworks last last night on the river because we wont be here on the 4th. it was only a twenty minute show, but it was really good. the weather was awesome! best so far this year. i kept thinking "oh this is just like Minnesota!" but then i remembered the mosquito's... well, have fun in the storm!...kind of.

They are both tired after taking turns driving 2,000 miles. The trip only took us 35 hours! A new record for our family.  I have school tomorrow! A brand new school, thousands of kids. my school last year had 10 people per class. can you say culture shock?
