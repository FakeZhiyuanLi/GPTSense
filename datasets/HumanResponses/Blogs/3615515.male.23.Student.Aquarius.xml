       One of my best friends from IIT Kanpur, Deepak Garg, arrived in IIML yesterday. He’s joining the PGP20 batch.   Those who know DG will tell you that he is one of the best thinkers of our batch from IITK and he deserves to be in a much better place than IIML. His coming to L this year was a surprise. I was expecting that he’ll crack either B or C (He didn’t get a call from A). But then life is full of surprises, some pleasant, some unpleasant and DG perhaps is going through one of those lean patches of life that all of us have been through at some point of time or the other. I’m sure he’ll come through and crack everything that comes his way from here onwards.   Best of luck, DG, for your stint at IIML.

       The last few days have been really boring. In fact, this whole sem promises to be a boring one. The classes start around 9 in the morning and go on till 5 in the evening. Most of them are one and half hour long classes - now, however good a prof may be, one and a half hours of continuous listening is a bit too much to expect.  Have recently started reading a book called 'Any human heart' by William Boyd. It's in the form of a private diary. From whatever I've read so far, it seems quite a good book - the celebration of a simple life.

       "A viable dieable Age. Chocolate is stickysweet and meltybrown. Truths lie off the beaten path, lurking in shadows to transform the reader from tourist to traveller, from voyeur to intrepid explorer."  ‘The God of small things’ is a touching narrative, a haunting tragedy and a slap across the hypocrisy and dualism of the social sytem that might still be existing in some parts of India. Arundhati Roy’s ability to play with the English language as a toy at her disposal makes this book nothing short of being a Masterpiece, one which no reviews or praise can do justice to.   ‘The God of small things’ is a journey – The journey of two children and the people who move in and out of their lives at different points of time.   It is the story of two young people, twins by birth, from a bittersweet childhood to an adulthood moulded by one bitter incident. When their English cousin, Sophie Mol, and her mother arrive on a Christmas visit, Estha and Rahel learn that “Things Can Change in a Day. That lives can twist into new, ugly shapes, even cease forever, beside their river graygreen. With fish in it. With the sky and trees in it. And at night, the broken yellow moon in it.”  As you read on, you live the lives of the people you read about. You experience the chemistry, the joys and the passion, the love, the songs, the tears, the fear and the pain of their lives.   However, what lies at the heart of the book is a sadness that is almost beautiful. Towards, the end of the book, the characters cease to exist as Rahel and Estha, or Ammu or Kochamma – what remains is a sense of loss, a void as if you yourself have gone through the traumatic and agonizing life that so many of the characters in the book have lived.  ‘The God of Small Things’ is a book about the greater emotions of life - Love. Madness. Hope. Infinite Joy. Never-ending Sadness.

       "Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."  ‘To kill a mocking bird’ is a slow starter. You have a rough time in the beginning wondering what the story is trying to tell you and what the title is all about. After all, you have great expectations from the book right from the start knowing that it’s a Pulitzer Prize winner and a lot of reputation behind it. However, by the time you have reached the end of the book, you are more than satisfied.   It is the story of simple people with simple beliefs – some right, some wrong, some good, some bad, some kind and some harsh. It is a book which challenges the moral beliefs that so many of us take for granted as axioms.  The narrator of the story is Scout, the daughter of Atticus Finch, a criminal defense attorney in the Deep South who is assigned to defend a black man in his trial for raping a white girl. The novel tells the story of how Scout and her family endure the threatening ridicule from their community for Atticus' loyalty to this man.   While Harper Lee delivers the message that black people were discriminated against in the Deep South, the more notable message was the struggle that Atticus Finch has to put up when he chooses to side with the truth. The character of Atticus is not so difficult to identify with. He is a simple man with the courage to stand up for the ideals that he believes in. Such people do exist, in numbers greater than we generally believe.   Perhaps, the greatness of the story lies in its narration through the innocent eyes of young Scout. Unlike most other critically acclaimed novels, ‘To kill a mocking bird’ is not depressing or hard hitting. It delivers its message in a simple manner, without disrupting the peace of mind of the reader.

       In the last one week, Debajit and I have had drinks together twice. He was pretty surprised seeing me drink comfortably because he has been trying to make me drink for a year now and I never gave in. I started drinking only in the summers. Its not that I am particularly fond of alcohol, just that now I'm pretty comfortable with drinking.   The night we drank together for the first time, we stayed awake almost all night chatting. A night out was due anyway since we had met after such a long time. Sometime around the morning, he told me that now that I've started drinking, I should take care that I dont make a habit of it. He said that these things start while having fun with friends but might develop into habits, if not kept within control. It was as if an elder brother (he's actually three months younger to me but ya... he's more experienced when it comes to drinking) was giving me advice, taking care that I dont go down the wrong path. All my life, I've been the elder brother to Aditya, and sometimes even Rahul, explaining to them what I think is right or wrong. It was quite a different feeling being on the other side. I actually liked it that someone was explaining to me what he thought was right for me (Of course, parents always take up that role when needed but its quite different when someone in your age group does it).

       I guess the final year of MBA will be the last opportunity for me to leisurely think about what I want to do with my life. It’s a difficult question, this one.  What is it that will give me a sense of purpose? Fifty years from now, what would I like to refer to as the work of my life? What am I doing today that is in the direction of the work of my life? Does the “work of my life” only refer to starting up one’s own company? If yes, do I have the entrepreneurial spirit in me to actually go through the trials and tribulations of starting up on my own? And will I not be happy if I take up a comfy, well paying and secure job in some MNC and climb up the corporate ladder one step at a time and be content with a good happy family life?  It would be wrong to say that the only way to achieve a sense of purpose is through your career. Surely, there are other things you could be proud of. Is Aditya not the pride of my parents? Can they not look at his smiling face proudly and say that he is the work of their life? They surely can. I often wonder whether life is to be treated as a race or a journey. For most part of my life, I’ve treated it as a race and at times have found myself asking – Whom am I racing against? Am I racing against myself? There are questions and more questions. I just hope I soon find the answer to at least some of them.

       When I got placed in GE for summers, I wasn’t sure whether I should be happy or sad? I mean, there was this satisfaction of getting into a slot one company but at the same time, I was very clear that among the slot one companies, GE was not rated very highly. And one could always say that who gives a shit about batch perception and stuff as long as you are happy, but then an MBA is basically an ego trip, wherein you are just as good as your performance in the last important event on campus whether it was the summer placement or the PPO or the term results. In this regard, it did hurt me a bit that I hadn’t got through a better company in terms of brand value on campuses.  However, the summers experience was an eye opener in more ways than one. Not only did the summers give me a lot of perspective about the kind of jobs that exist in the corporate world, it also elevated GE to a much higher status in my eyes and I’m not saying this just because I’m supposed to defend the company where I go for summers.  GE has this extremely open culture where you are allowed to create for yourself your own comfortable shell and work independently. We were given good, independent, live projects which were not just garb as most projects in other companies were. These projects were very much related to the business and most were business researches being undertaken to look at emerging markets or the gaps in the existing markets. Most importantly, we were not expected to be secretaries to our guides and put in their thoughts into the project but were expected to bring in our own fresh perspectives. The timings were flexible and we were allowed to work whenever we wanted to and the way we wanted to, as long as we had something to show to our guides at each review. For the two months that we were there, GE treated us with the respect that is due to people integral to the organization. We could go and contact anyone and everyone in the organization for our projects and more importantly, everyone was helpful and encouraging.  The company culture was open and we talked on a first name basis with everyone in the organization. All this added up to a tremendously comfortable work environment which absorbed us in very quickly. And of course, how can one forget the perks of being in GE! Oh Boy!! The lunch was something each and every summer intern at Corporate Park would look forward to each morning. It was absolutely ‘Awesome, dude, Awesome!’ (This is how Ron would put it everyday). We were also allowed free access to cold drinks, coffee and biscuits all through the day. The Girls in GE were all pretty, which added to the entire ‘feel good’ thing at GE. And the bottom-line is – The MONEY was good! GE definitely keeps its people happy!   Most of our project guides were extremely busy with their own work. But even in their busy schedules, they did find time for us. Both my guides, Amitabh and Rajesh were extremely helpful. Not only did they help out in my projects, they also tried at their own level to make me comfortable in the organization. While Amitabh pushed me harder towards a comprehensive analysis of the project and gave me ample opportunities to make mistakes and correct them, Rajesh made sure I never made them at all – he actually went out of his way to make me comfortable with the idea of mystery shopping for the competitive benchmarking part, which could have become a very contentious issue – Rajesh made sure that I had the VPs backing for this part. Rajesh would also sometimes ask me about how things were going and whether I was facing any problems related to the project or even unrelated to the project. My guides played a big role in my doing well in my projects and having a good stint at GE.  All in all, the two months at GE went off very well. Getting the PPO was very very satisfying. I truly believe that there were some amongst the 27 summer trainees who were better than me in a lot of respects. Some of these did not get PPOs for the sole reason that they had an off day during the Assessment Centre. The PPO does not prove anything. It is, like so many other important things in life, dependent a lot on luck. However, it is one of those little rewards of life that makes you feel happy and confident about yourself.

       I’ve always been a private person and still am and that’s why blogging never appealed to me as it did to so many people around me. However, sometime during the summers I did feel that a blog need not be a personal diary but it could also be a place where I put down my thoughts and feelings in a structured manner so as to make useful and, if not useful, at least interesting reading for people who, like me, have nothing to do with their time. Hence, the blog - Straight from the Heart.

       I have often wondered whether we actually need profs to teach us the course. I mean, most of what they teach is stuff that one could understand anyway if one read the book. Moreover, one would probably save a lot of time that is otherwise spent in the class. As for the exams, most of us crack them because of our innate ability to either cram up stuff one day before the D-day or our ability to play with numbers and come up with an answer that is required to get marks. In any case, exams are hardly a true reflection of one’s learning or grasp of a subject. So the question then is whether a prof facilitates learning that would otherwise be difficult to achieve. To be very frank, in my humble, personal opinion most of the courses that I’ve done in IIML could have been done as well had someone else been teaching the course instead of the prof who taught us. And when a prof throws a question paper at you that is the exact replica of last year’s question paper, you sort of lose respect for the entire system that allows such things to happen.   But then, every once in a while, you also come across professors like AB and Jha who through the sheer breadth and depth of their knowledge and passion for teaching command the respect that is ideally due to each and every prof.   AB is an absolute stud. None of his students would ever dispute this. Everything about him commands respect – the way he teaches, the way he dissects a case and addresses the core issues involved, his focus on learning and disdain for petty things like attendance, even his exams command respect.   Jha, I guess, is not so popular amongst the students simply because of the emphasis that he lays on rules and the amount of commitment that he expects for his course. But what I like about him is his passion for his subject and his commitment to the cause of making good managers out of us. He reminds me of the profs in IIT who have immense knowledge about their subject and believe that if they make it tougher for the students to go through the course, the students will finally, at the end of the course, emerge tougher and better. His lectures are absolutely unstructured and one might find it difficult go about his course in the normal manner of making notes and then cramming them before the exams. But then, his lectures are not about getting to know the 4Ps or something, they are about learning to think in a manner that hits the core issue of the problems that we might face as managers. I agree that his course in sometimes a pain because you are always expected to submit one assignment or the other or be prepared with a case presentation or something, but given a chance, if I have to choose my electives all over again, I would be ready to go through the pain again simply because I feel his classes are a value addition in terms of making us better thinkers of management problems.

       At the age of 18, when I was going to begin my journey at IIT, I felt young and successful. I felt that the world was at my feet. More importantly, I felt assured and confident of my future. Today, five years hence, having successfully completed IIT with a decent grade, having got into an IIM, having got a pre placement offer from a company of great repute worldwide, I feel confused as to what I want to do with my life.  Ya... I do have a job but then, GE is not going to offer me finance so there’s this big question whether I should accept it or not? I’ll write more about this in a later blog. The more pertinent issue is that I have no idea where my life is heading. I’ve no control over what kind of a job I’m going to get. In February, I’ll sit for placements and within 3 days, my fate will be sealed. For all you know, I might end up with some IT company in slot III, where I don’t wanna go – especially after rejecting a PPO from GE.  And it’s not just about the first job; it’s about the holistic picture getting blurred with every passing day. I talk to Diwaker on chat and he seems so sure that one day he’ll come back to India and start up something of his own, that someday he’ll make his own small contribution to the world around him. He simply seems to have all the answers – no confusion whatsoever.  I do think that I’ll have a decent career if I continue to go along the path I’m presently on. However, the catch is, I also do think that I would have wasted my potential, like so many others do, by not following my gut feeling as to what I really wanna do in life. Today, I look around me and find that I have such a tremendous amount of respect for the kind of work Tarun Tejpal did with ‘Tehelka’, or the kind of work Barkha Dutt does. I’ve always respected the profession of journalism more than anything else. Perhaps, I should have gone for something like that. Why didn’t I go for it? Because I was too busy and obsessed with charting out a career path that would be termed “successful” by the people around me. But then, at that time, I was a kid with boyish dreams of making it big in the corporate world someday – so IIT + IIM seemed to be a natural choice. Today, a little mature but nevertheless boyish, I’ve got these ideals of true happiness, job satisfaction, social contribution etc. And it makes me wonder whether IIT + IIM were the right choice after all.

       One year is a short time to change people’s attitude. Yet, a lot has changed in the last one year. One only has to take a look at the PGP1s slogging out in the lib, having involved discussions over their projects and assignments to remind oneself that we, the PGP2s, were also once like them.   I look around me today to see what my batchmates and I are doing and all that I see is fraud and more fraud. Across all subjects, our profs are wondering why is it that we don’t come prepared for case discussions anymore, why is it that we don’t do any assignments, why is it that all our project reports are just google searches conducted in a few hours while they should have been in-depth analysis’s reflecting our learning in the last one year. Some of these profs who have taught us in the first year are absolutely clueless as to what could have gone so wrong that the same set of students who used to be so attentive till last year find the lectures soporific these days. One year is a short time to change people’s attitude. Yet, a lot has changed in the last one year.   Let me look at myself and the people around me to get some perspective. When I came to IIML, I was this high enthu guy, determined to make my stay at L worthwhile, determined to take charge of my studies, my projects and work hard towards a really good CG. In no time, I had already got the reputation of a muggu, a guy who would do the project work alone if nobody else contributed. But I was very lucky in the first term - I had a really good project group. Although, I took charge of almost all the projects, the others contributed really well. In fact, we were so happy with the composition that we continued with almost the same group throughout the year. Our project group from second term onwards was one that could be envied – we were four studs and one hard working idiot (yours truly!). I took a tremendous amount of pride in my project group. It was not just that we all did good work and were dependable, it was also that we were five people who were ready to accept our mistakes as and when we made them and then rectify those mistakes. The brainstorming sessions for our various projects would be very satisfying - the ideas that came up, the analysis that we did were truly commendable. As time passed, our projects became more structured, more in-depth, and more presentable. This progress that we saw in ourselves was really satisfying. The point that I’m trying to make is that I was in the company of people who were really good, sincere students and good people and it was as if we would always remain this good group, who would do everything we ever took up well. And yet, it all changed. I am no longer the high enthu guy that I used to be, and I can see that the killer instinct with which my group used to attack our projects is missing. We no longer take up our projects as challenges; they’re more like burdens on our shoulders. What went wrong? Some would say its burnout but I doubt it. Post summers, we, as a batch, seem to have lost respect for the institution that is IIML. We seem to believe that this institute is not as great as it is made out to be, we seem to believe that we are all real studs and that we’ll show our studness directly in the industry because our courses are not worth working hard for. We seem to believe that exams can no longer test our true potential and hence any exam that screws us is actually flawed itself – and we find really good excuses to screw up our exams. Forget about the exams, whatever happened to our project presentations, assignments, case discussions?  Well, all I can say is that these days when I see the PGP1s, there is this feeling of regret that comes up in my heart that I no longer have the same zeal in my eyes that I see in theirs. All I can say is that these days I sometimes try to reignite the fire within and keep failing and then keep trying again. And I wonder whether I’ll be able to do it by the end of this year because one year is a short time to change people’s attitude. Yet, since a lot has changed in the last one year, I can always hope that a lot will change in the next one year, hopefully for the better.
