      Following on from my shampoo rant, here is another:  'Silk absorbs up to 6 times its weight in water (Yes, but it does weigh almost nothing...) This moisturiser (possibly Dove) contains silk. For silky skin.'  ...yeah.

      As I was perusing...blahblahblah...leads to... My anger today is directed towards lack of cynicism. I have some shampoo in my house. Wait, there's more!! It has a graph on the back of it. Two, actually. The title of the whole thing is 'Action of the fruit concentrate' One graph is 'Strength test', the other 'Smoothness test'. They both are bar charts showing a left-hand bar on each graph that is shorter than the right hand bar. In both cases the left hand is 'Before' and the right hand 'after'. Here it is if you want to see (bottom of the page). Or go to your supermarket.  http://forums.cozycot.com/cozypurrs/displaybycategory.php?master_id=4   What is wrong with this? How many mistakes can YOU spot? I'll leave a big space, so may actually consider doing it, O Child of Instant Access who never does anything unless there is a direct link to it. Anyway, do it. Now. Yes, now! Stop reading all this stuff, get a pen and paper (or open up a document if you're one of those) and do it.                     Anyway, here are my answers: 1. Before and After what? 2. No scale. Could be upside down, for all I know. 3. What were the tests? 3a. How many times did they repeat the test?  3b. Were the results fair? Was it just asking someone 'Is your hair smoother/stronger now?' and waiting 'til they got someone who said 'yes'? 4. Action of the friut concentrate on what? 5. Strength and Smoothness of what? 6. How do you measure Smoothness?  There are probably more things. If you spot any outstanding ones, or have otherwise been incensed by my Blog, mail them to me, when I give you my E-mail in a bit. I want to check people can't send virurses, and I can delete the post with it in, and stuff. And while I'm on shampoo, the adverts have some glaring problems, too.  1. Often they claim to 'nourish hair'. Hair doesn't need nourishing. It's dead cells. 2. No shampoo currently could reduce knots. 3. One shampoo advert used this technique: 'It's shampoo!! It has NUTRIENTS!!! ['nutrients' flash up, dozens a second, on screen. They are mostly elements.] The one I noticed most was U238 (Uranium 238). Quote, from http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/phy00/phy00108.htm 'Question -   What is Uranium-238 used for? What is the main purpose for Uranium-238?   Since U238 is a stable isotope of uranium, it will not produce energy in a nuclear reactor.  For this we have to have U235, which is unstable.  U238, since it IS stable is the most commonly occuring isotope of uranium when it is dug out of the ground.  So usually to use the uranium in a power plant, the amount of U235 must be increased, run the ore thru a plant and pull out slightly more U238 than U235, leaving an enriched uranium, enough U235 to run the reactor.  We would not want pure U235 in a power plant, this would make it too much like a bomb.  So in this case U238 is "used" to sort of dillute the U235, to make U235 a safe fuel.  In what is called a breeder reactor, U238 can be converted to unstable isotopes, and these then used for fuel.  So in this case U238 would be the starting point for other things, eventually ending up with a fuel for a nuclear power plant.  This is not a common thing these days partly because of concern that it is too easy to keep going to make bomb quality fuel.' etc....  That's all for today, probably. I hope you have learned to be more cynical. Remember, adverts are mostly trying to sell you things. Never buy stuff advertised. Or turn over. Some adverts cost millions of pounds. Think of the fun you can have, destroying something which costs that much, by turning over for two minutes. Plus they can't get at you.

      Today's subject of my rage: Corporations. Specifically, McDonald's. Their latest advertising campaign of the recurring jingle :'Da-da!-da!-dadaa!! I'm lov-in' it' is possibly the most evil thing ever done by a corporation. It is widely accepted in my group of friends that the chief difference between companies and corporations is that corporations are evil. (Scientific Test: which sounds more evil?: 'Hello. I am Smith of the Globex Company.' 'Hello. I am Smith of the Globex  Corporation .' The second one, obviously. Anyway. McDonalds. The thing is, the whole campaign is designed to get you. The cheery notes ascending, the catchy colloquial slogan, all designed to get into your mind and rot it, turning it red and yellow. Soon, all you will be able to utter is 'Have a nice day' and 'Do you want fries with that?'. (Why do they ask you that? I have NEVER heard anyone say: 'Why, yes, I would. I am completely incapable of thinking "Hmm, I fancy some fried potato strips, I'll buy some". Thankyou, McEmployee, you have enabled me to buy them without activating my brain, sending me further into becoming totally brain-dead, hypnotised by modern culture.'). I am watching you with my spyware. I have cunningly inserted this warning in the middle of an old post, so most of you won't see it. Hahaha. And back to the slogan once more. I have noticed people walking down the street, humming under their breath, the little jingle. I just want to reach out and shake them: 'Can't you SEE!!! That's exactly what they WANT you to do!! They're invading your MIND!! AAAARRRGGHHH!!!'. And so on. This is just a fraction of what I have to say about corporations. There will be more.

      It's early. I'm tired. My rage functions aren't  working yet. So all you fans (both of you) will have to make do with just my dicussion of boredom. So. What is the most boring thing in the world? To set up a test for this, imagine you are in this hypothetical situation: You have just had a long haul-plane flight. You are on your way to a three-day conference about  what? . The conference's speakers will all be bald men with combovers, who last took a style update in the 'brown' period of the 70's. They will also drone. And be unable to get any jokes whatsoever. Apart from theirs, which will be long, boring and not funny. Paperclips Nails (The metal sort. Small ones, too) Boxes. Staples. Paper. Seamus Heaney / Gillian Clark etc.... Something vague and sciency - but boring.  Of these I would be tempted to say that nails was the most boring. I would find it difficult to make nails interesting for a minute, let alone 3 days. With paperclips and paper, there is the aspect of making little sculptures or origami, and we all had fun in boxes as children. Science: just a bigger subject. And staples...they're just more interesting. Not much, but more. ANd as for the poets...there's the raw hatred that would sustain me.  Feedback appreciated.

      Look at this: http://inspirations.crossdaily.com/shakeitoff/: A farmer owned an old donkey. One day, while leaning in to get a drink, the donkey fell into the farmer's well. The farmer heard the donkey braying loudly and followed the sound to its source -- and found the donkey standing at the bottom of the well.  After carefully assessing the situation, the farmer sympathized with the old donkey, but the well was deep, and there was no way to haul the donkey out of it. The farmer called his neighbors, and asked them to come give him a hand - and to bring dirt and shovels. The neighboring farmers came, with dirt and shovels in their trucks. Neither the donkey nor the well was worth the trouble of saving. The only thing they could think to do was to bury the old donkey in the well and put him out of his misery. It was a shame, but there was nothing else that could be done. As the farmers shoveled dirt into the well, the old donkey was hysterical!  The donkey brayed louder than ever when the dirt hit his back, but the farmers kept shoveling.  Then the farmers noticed what the donkey was doing. Every time a shovel load of dirt landed on the donkey's back, he brayed loudly -- but then he would shake it off and step up!  As the dirt was shoveled down on top of him, the donkey continued.  The farmers and the old donkey got into a rhthym -- the farmers would drop a shovel load of dirt down the well, and the donkey would shake it off and step up. No matter how heavy the dirt, or how distressing the situation seemed, the old donkey fought panic and just kept right on shaking it off and stepping up!  Finally, battered and exhausted, the old donkey stepped triumphantly over the wall of the well! What seemed like it would bury him actually helped him ... all because of the manner in which he handled his adversity. Instead of letting it bury him, the dirt became his road to freedom.  Makes you sick, doesn't it? I first saw this in an E-mail sent to me by an aquaintance. I hate this kind of thing. Life is awful and hard. You really think you can solve all someone's problems by sending them a cheery chain letter? And what was worse was that they had added this:  NOW --------  Enough of that crap . . .  The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock. MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:   When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass, it always comes back to bite you.   It just makes me so mad! The person who wrote tha was trying to appeal to people like me, getting at my cynicism but what they didn't realise was this: Sent into overdrive by the '>Fwd:Fwd: Donkey Story' heading, the cynicism centres of my brain set my face to 'scowl' and the rest of my brain to hate. Therefore, I was still in a state of rage and cynicism when I got to the 'amusing' bit at the end. It may have raised the slightest twitch of the lips in approval otherwise, but as it was, it just sent me further into the hatred of E-Culture. I have some more to say, but this post is pretty long, and I'm afraid my computer will crash, losing it all, so I'll post another. There should be more soon.

      I bet this won't work. Bloody computers. My broadband connection took two hours to connect today. TWO HOURS!! And I (well, my Dad) am paying £17.99 for this! P.s. Tiscali, please don't hurt me. I love your service, especially since you swept all the mess we made signing up away. You're miles better than AOL.  More soon.

      Oh, while I remember, an interesting thing happened on the train today. Just as it pulled out of the station, it ground to a halt. After a minute or so, the driver came on the intercom: 'I'm sorry, we are experiencing delays due to ninja-related reasons. Please stay calm.' No sooner had the chime signalled the end of the message when a hundred, no TWO HUNDRED ninjas burst into the opposite end of the carriage. As I stood up and prepared to do battle, a razor-sharp sword sliced through the roof and a final one jumped through. He was obviously the leader. I knew if I could take him down, I had won. I rushed headlong towards them. The first onrushing ninjas were quickly taken out by some well-timed punches and kicks. While I took the first few down, the rest stood around, running in circles or jumping from one foot to another, as normal. One by one more rushed at me. I grabbed the first's nunchuks and threw them on the floor, then as he bent to retrieve them, kicked him over and knocked him unconscious. The second went down to a two-fingered eye-poke. The third and fourth pulled off some fancy moves, but knocked each other out when they both swung at me while I ducked. Grabbing a pole from the interior, I quickly sent the next few flying in quick succession. Then, I noticed some escaping through the already broken windows. They were going to take over the driver's compartment! Grabbing an overhead bar, I vaulted out, knocking their feet out from under them as they came past. The next few fell to a series of deft moves. Suddenly, a ninja was flying down at me after taking a huge jump. Thinking fast, I grabbed his ankle, spinning round and knocking most of the remaining ninjas away, before flinging my impromptu weapon away also. The final few went down to dirty fighting. I was just about to dust off my hands when a sword burst through the roof below me. The leader! I swung through the carriage window again, to be greeted with a sword cutting off a few hairs. 'Hey, don't give too warm a welcome!', I quipped wittily. Evidently my good humour was wasted. I dodged a thrust, a jab, an uppercut and a slash. I managed to land a or two blow on him, but they did nothing. It looked like the end. I stood still, knowing there was no chance of escape. As he sized me up, the lead ninja looked round at a noise behind him: 'What'choo doin' sucka!!' My heart leapt: 'Mr. T!!' It was him! 'Hey, this fool givin' you trouble?' My nodded emphatically. 'No trouble!' Mr. T strode towards the ninja, unworried by the sword. The ninja grinned evilly, but I knew what would happen. The sword came down heavily on Mr. T's chainses, and smashed into a thousand pieses. 'Fool!! Nuthin' hurts ma chainses!! They're helluva stong!' Mr T. picked up the ninja and threw him through a window. 'That'll teach you, sucka!!' he shouted, and with a final wink at me, he jumped into his van, grabbed some Mr T. ceareal and drove off at Mach. 2. His van's helluva fast, fool! 'As the problem has now been corrected, we will resume our journey.', said the driver as the passengers cheered me and Mr. T. I settled down with my paper, and arrived only 6 minutes late.

      I knew I wouldn't post much on this. I'm so apathetic. Anyway, let blogging commence: Ye gods (too much Discworld), I'm turning into a Adrian Mole. Look what I wrote in my diary yesterday:  Nothing like contact with the real world to make you realise how dull it all is. No wonder so many people live in fantasy, and as for those that don't...I am reminded of the hyponotised masses of 'Nineteen-Eighty-Four'. The bland TV, the R'n'B blaring from fashion stores; so artificial; a veil over reality. The Modern World. Yeuch.  Anyway, I've recovered now.

      I stole all this from  urlLink The Weekly  , but I hope they'll understand that I wanted to share it with a slightly wider audience.  Good Deaths, Bad Deaths Good Deaths   Being the last survivor of your generation, so when researchers come to talk to you, you just make up a lot of stupid facts and cause all subsequent history books to be wrong.  “And remember - there's a fortune hidden in the old hmlmblrmblmrrrghh.”  Taking everyone in this damn office with you in a massive, fiery explosion a split-second after they stare into your whooping face in terrible realisation.  Falling into a black hole which crushes you to a near-singularity, so that you have to be buried in an incredibly tiny coffin that still takes six struggling pallbearers to lift.  "Checkmate, I think, Colonel."  Dying in such a way that you're remembered as part of an acronym.  A string of ever more impressive blazes of glory.  Riding a nuclear bomb into Exmouth.  Secretly replacing your skeleton and organs with fireworks, opium, magnesium blocks, 245-trioxin, etc., and leaving strict instructions to be cremated.  Reappearing a good 45 minutes after you'd been left for dead and saving the day by calmly and with great precision piloting your hot-air balloon over the rocket silo, holding yourself erect and shielding your eyes wistfully from the dazzlingly glorious rising sun as blood trickles down your gripping knuckles over the weave of the basket, and grey-jumpsuited minions run around sharp and angular corridors in panic and the foaming mastermind tries to stop the automated launch sequence, and the brass section sweeps in on the soundtrack.   Bad Deaths   Being crushed by a bookcase, and some of the books fall open to reveal hidden pornography magazines, which you had no idea existed and were actually left there by the previous tenant.  Turning inside-out after a madman has secretly turbo-charged one of those little mouth Hoovers they use to suck spit out of your mouth at the dentist's.  "That's just what he'd want us to think, so it must be the blue wire!"  Mixing up the envelopes so your henchman gets a letter full of news about the children, while Aunt Eunice is ordered to kill Bunky Charley, which she does, except, mixing up the nicknames, she goes for a waiter named Charles at your favourite restaurant, and he steps aside at the critical moment to adjust a candle, so the poisoned dart hits you by mistake.  Misguided relatives paying to ensure that your memory is keep alive in the form of a bench.  Being the first person ripped apart in flames by a marauding alien, just so everyone realises the situation is serious.  Anything involving a loss of trousers.  Becoming involved in an elaborate kidnap plot which ends with you trapped in a bare cell in a subterranean headquarters, and you say, "Well, that's one thing - they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to bring us here just to kill us," but they have, and someone walks in and shoots you in the back of the head.  Mistaking World o' Orphans for the runway.  "Tis a better, better far thing I... CHRIST'S DAMNATION!"  Using perfect timing based on the ever-diminishing gaps between floor indicator lights in a plummeting lift to spring impact-reversingly into the air at the precise moment you hit the bottom of the shaft then, just as your hair lightly brushes the emergency trapdoor at the apex of your leap, having your head dashed from your shoulders by the sizzling electrical motor which crashes down through the roof.  Being given a new identity by the government, then beaten to death in mistake for someone else.  Curiosity about tolerance levels.

      This is a quote from some song, but I can't find the d*mned thing, so I can't credit it. 'When I was a boy, my uncle called me up to his deathbed, and said; 'Son, there are a hundred things every man's gotta know in life. And here are 39 of them. 1. A virgin don't never drive a Z-28. 2. Never bet the ranch on your prostate. 3. If it's got an adam's apple it's probably a man. 4. Never trust a gay gypsy with the palm of your hand. 5. She didn't accidentally get good in bed. 6. You can't join the church if you're already dead. 7. A work uniform ain't totally nude. 8. Brim & bass ain't seafood. 9. When there's guns in the house one better be yours. 10. Don't be nekkid next to any fishing lures. 11. If there's girl scout cookies she's a little too young. 12. If you say "I do" be the ugly one. 13. Don't ever let a bald man borrow your comb. 14. Never play strip poker in a nursing home. 15. Don't blame your pallbearers cause they don't show if you're buried in the middle of the Super Bowl. 16. Let people borrow money and they'll leave you alone. 17. Never fry bacon without a shirt on. 18. Never spray water on a hornet's nest. 19. A woman rarely aces the drivers' test. 20. The sign probably don't really mean massage. 21. Never threaten anybody in camoflage. 22. Say you love her til she lays down the butcher knife. 23. Never put the move on the boss's wife. 24. She's messin' round on you if your briefs don't fit. 25. Never trust a hitchhiker to baby sit. 26. Cosmo's never in a happy home. 27. You can't cut a deal with a kidney stone. 28. A politician ain't got an HMO. 29. Washing her hair means she don't wanna go. 30. Don't ridicule a biker about his tatoo. 31. You been married nine times? Hell, maybe it's you. 32. "Doom" ain't the same as "Donkey Kong." 33. If he's wearing high heels you might have raised him wrong. 34. The clinic ain't the best place to pick up dates. 35. Don't rent a room from a man named Bates. 36. A tank top's never on a billionaire. 37. Stevie Ray Vaughn missed a note here and there. 38. How many get to heaven? No one knows. 39. But hell will be asses and elbows. And then he died. Just rolled right over and died. I never did find out what those other 61 things were. So if you think you know, why not contact me?'

      This will be my biggest post so far, possibly ever. But I suggest you read it. It's jolly good.   The Door in the Wall  by  H. G. Wells  One confidential evening, not three months ago, Lionel Wallace told me this story of the Door in the Wall. And at the time I thought that so far as he was concerned it was a true story. He told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that I could not do otherwise than believe in him. But in the morning, in my own flat, I woke to a different atmosphere, and as I lay in bed and recalled the things he had told me, stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice, denuded of the focussed shaded table light, the shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and the pleasant bright things, the dessert and glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared, making them for the time a bright little world quite cut off from every-day realities, I saw it all as frankly incredible. "He was mystifying!" I said, and then: "How well he did it!. . . . . It isn't quite the thing I should have expected him, of all people, to do well." Afterwards, as I sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea, I found myself trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his impossible reminiscences, by supposing they did in some way suggest, present, convey--I hardly know which word to use--experiences it was otherwise impossible to tell. Well, I don't resort to that explanation now. I have got over my intervening doubts. I believe now, as I believed at the moment of telling, that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his secret for me. But whether he himself saw, or only thought he saw, whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege, or the victim of a fantastic dream, I cannot pretend to guess. Even the facts of his death, which ended my doubts forever, throw no light on that. That much the reader must judge for himself. I forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a man to confide in me. He was, I think, defending himself against an imputation of slackness and unreliability I had made in relation to a great public movement in which he had disappointed me. But he plunged suddenly. "I have" he said, "a preoccupation--" "I know," he went on, after a pause that he devoted to the study of his cigar ash, "I have been negligent. The fact is--it isn't a case of ghosts or apparitions--but--it's an odd thing to tell of, Redmond--I am haunted. I am haunted by something--that rather takes the light out of things, that fills me with longings . . . . ." He paused, checked by that English shyness that so often overcomes us when we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things. "You were at Saint Athelstan's all through," he said, and for a moment that seemed to me quite irrelevant. "Well"--and he paused. Then very haltingly at first, but afterwards more easily, he began to tell of the thing that was hidden in his life, the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his heart with insatiable longings that made all the interests and spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him. Now that I have the clue to it, the thing seems written visibly in his face. I have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught and intensified. It reminds me of what a woman once said of him--a woman who had loved him greatly. "Suddenly," she said, "the interest goes out of him. He forgets you. He doesn't care a rap for you--under his very nose . . . . ." Yet the interest was not always out of him, and when he was holding his attention to a thing Wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful man. His career, indeed, is set with successes. He left me behind him long ago; he soared up over my head, and cut a figure in the world that I couldn't cut--anyhow. He was still a year short of forty, and they say now that he would have been in office and very probably in the new Cabinet if he had lived. At school he always beat me without effort--as it were by nature. We were at school together at Saint Athelstan's College in West Kensington for almost all our school time. He came into the school as my co-equal, but he left far above me, in a blaze of scholarships and brilliant performance. Yet I think I made a fair average running. And it was at school I heard first of the Door in the Wall--that I was to hear of a second time only a month before his death. To him at least the Door in the Wall was a real door leading through a real wall to immortal realities. Of that I am now quite assured. And it came into his life early, when he was a little fellow between five and six. I remember how, as he sat making his confession to me with a slow gravity, he reasoned and reckoned the date of it. "There was," he said, "a crimson Virginia creeper in it--all one bright uniform crimson in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall. That came into the impression somehow, though I don't clearly remember how, and there were horse-chestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door. They were blotched yellow and green, you know, not brown nor dirty, so that they must have been new fallen. I take it that means October. I look out for horse-chestnut leaves every year, and I ought to know. "If I'm right in that, I was about five years and four months old." He was, he said, rather a precocious little boy--he learned to talk at an abnormally early age, and he was so sane and "old-fashioned," as people say, that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children scarcely attain by seven or eight. His mother died when he was born, and he was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess. His father was a stern, preoccupied lawyer, who gave him little attention, and expected great things of him. For all his brightness he found life a little grey and dull I think. And one day he wandered. He could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away, nor the course he took among the West Kensington roads. All that had faded among the incurable blurs of memory. But the white wall and the green door stood out quite distinctly. As his memory of that remote childish experience ran, he did at the very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion, an attraction, a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in. And at the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him--he could not tell which--to yield to this attraction. He insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginning--unless memory has played him the queerest trick--that the door was unfastened, and that he could go in as he chose. I seem to see the figure of that little boy, drawn and repelled. And it was very clear in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never explained, that his father would be very angry if he went through that door. Wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost particularity. He went right past the door, and then, with his hands in his pockets, and making an infantile attempt to whistle, strolled right along beyond the end of the wall. There he recalls a number of mean, dirty shops, and particularly that of a plumber and decorator, with a dusty disorder of earthenware pipes, sheet lead ball taps, pattern books of wall paper, and tins of enamel. He stood pretending to examine these things, and coveting, passionately desiring the green door. Then, he said, he had a gust of emotion. He made a run for it, lest hesitation should grip him again, he went plump with outstretched hand through the green door and let it slam behind him. And so, in a trice, he came into the garden that has haunted all his life. It was very difficult for Wallace to give me his full sense of that garden into which he came. There was something in the very air of it that exhilarated, that gave one a sense of lightness and good happening and well being; there was something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect and subtly luminous. In the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely glad--as only in rare moments and when one is young and joyful one can be glad in this world. And everything was beautiful there . . . . . Wallace mused before he went on telling me. "You see," he said, with the doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things, "there were two great panthers there . . . Yes, spotted panthers. And I was not afraid. There was a long wide path with marble-edged flower borders on either side, and these two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball. One looked up and came towards me, a little curious as it seemed. It came right up to me, rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small hand I held out and purred. It was, I tell you, an enchanted garden. I know. And the size? Oh! it stretched far and wide, this way and that. I believe there were hills far away. Heaven knows where West Kensington had suddenly got to. And somehow it was just like coming home. "You know, in the very moment the door swung to behind me, I forgot the road with its fallen chestnut leaves, its cabs and tradesmen's carts, I forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience of home, I forgot all hesitations and fear, forgot discretion, forgot all the intimate realities of this life. I became in a moment a very glad and wonder-happy little boy--in another world. It was a world with a different quality, a warmer, more penetrating and mellower light, with a faint clear gladness in its air, and wisps of sun-touched cloud in the blueness of its sky. And before me ran this long wide path, invitingly, with weedless beds on either side, rich with untended flowers, and these two great panthers. I put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur, and caressed their round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears, and played with them, and it was as though they welcomed me home. There was a keen sense of home-coming in my mind, and when presently a tall, fair girl appeared in the pathway and came to meet me, smiling, and said 'Well?' to me, and lifted me, and kissed me, and put me down, and led me by the hand, there was no amazement, but only an impression of delightful rightness, of being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been overlooked. There were broad steps, I remember, that came into view between spikes of delphinium, and up these we went to a great avenue between very old and shady dark trees. All down this avenue, you know, between the red chapped stems, were marble seats of honour and statuary, and very tame and friendly white doves . . . . . "And along this avenue my girl-friend led me, looking down--I recall the pleasant lines, the finely-modelled chin of her sweet kind face--asking me questions in a soft, agreeable voice, and telling me things, pleasant things I know, though what they were I was never able to recall . . . And presently a little Capuchin monkey, very clean, with a fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes, came down a tree to us and ran beside me, looking up at me and grinning, and presently leapt to my shoulder. So we went on our way in great happiness . . . ." He paused. "Go on," I said. "I remember little things. We passed an old man musing among laurels, I remember, and a place gay with paroquets, and came through a broad shaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace, full of pleasant fountains, full of beautiful things, full of the quality and promise of heart's desire. And there were many things and many people, some that still seem to stand out clearly and some that are a little vague, but all these people were beautiful and kind. In some way--I don't know how--it was conveyed to me that they all were kind to me, glad to have me there, and filling me with gladness by their gestures, by the touch of their hands, by the welcome and love in their eyes. Yes--" He mused for awhile. "Playmates I found there. That was very much to me, because I was a lonely little boy. They played delightful games in a grass-covered court where there was a sun-dial set about with flowers. And as one played one loved . . . . "But--it's odd--there's a gap in my memory. I don't remember the games we played. I never remembered. Afterwards, as a child, I spent long hours trying, even with tears, to recall the form of that happiness. I wanted to play it all over again--in my nursery --by myself. No! All I remember is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me . . . . Then presently came a sombre dark woman, with a grave, pale face and dreamy eyes, a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple, who carried a book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above a hall--though my playmates were loth to have me go, and ceased their game and stood watching as I was carried away. 'Come back to us!' they cried. 'Come back to us soon!' I looked up at her face, but she heeded them not at all. Her face was very gentle and grave. She took me to a seat in the gallery, and I stood beside her, ready to look at her book as she opened it upon her knee. The pages fell open. She pointed, and I looked, marvelling, for in the living pages of that book I saw myself; it was a story about myself, and in it were all the things that had happened to me since ever I was born . . . . "It was wonderful to me, because the pages of that book were not pictures, you understand, but realities." Wallace paused gravely--looked at me doubtfully. "Go on," I said. "I understand." "They were realities--yes, they must have been; people moved and things came and went in them; my dear mother, whom I had near forgotten; then my father, stern and upright, the servants, the nursery, all the familiar things of home. Then the front door and the busy streets, with traffic to and fro: I looked and marvelled, and looked half doubtfully again into the woman's face and turned the pages over, skipping this and that, to see more of this book, and more, and so at last I came to myself hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall, and felt again the conflict and the fear. "'And next?' I cried, and would have turned on, but the cool hand of the grave woman delayed me. "'Next?' I insisted, and struggled gently with her hand, pulling up her fingers with all my childish strength, and as she yielded and the page came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow. "But the page did not show the enchanted garden, nor the panthers, nor the girl who had led me by the hand, nor the playfellows who had been so loth to let me go. It showed a long grey street in West Kensington, on that chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit, and I was there, a wretched little figure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do to restrain myself, and I was weeping because I could not return to my dear play-fellows who had called after me, 'Come back to us! Come back to us soon!' I was there. This was no page in a book, but harsh reality; that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee I stood had gone--whither have they gone?" He halted again, and remained for a time, staring into the fire. "Oh! the wretchedness of that return!" he murmured. "Well?" I said after a minute or so. "Poor little wretch I was--brought back to this grey world again! As I realised the fulness of what had happened to me, I gave way to quite ungovernable grief. And the shame and humiliation of that public weeping and my disgraceful homecoming remain with me still. I see again the benevolent-looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke to me--prodding me first with his umbrella. 'Poor little chap,' said he; 'and are you lost then?'--and me a London boy of five and more! And he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me, and so march me home. Sobbing, conspicuous and frightened, I came from the enchanted garden to the steps of my father's house.  "That is as well as I can remember my vision of that garden--the garden that haunts me still. Of course, I can convey nothing of that indescribable quality of translucent unreality, that difference from the common things of experience that hung about it all; but that--that is what happened. If it was a dream, I am sure it was a day-time and altogether extraordinary dream . . . . . . H'm!--naturally there followed a terrible questioning, by my aunt, my father, the nurse, the governess--everyone . . . . . . "I tried to tell them, and my father gave me my first thrashing for telling lies. When afterwards I tried to tell my aunt, she punished me again for my wicked persistence. Then, as I said, everyone was forbidden to listen to me, to hear a word about it. Even my fairy tale books were taken away from me for a time--because I was 'too imaginative.' Eh? Yes, they did that! My father belonged to the old school . . . . . And my story was driven back upon myself. I whispered it to my pillow--my pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears. And I added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request: 'Please God I may dream of the garden. Oh! take me back to my garden! Take me back to my garden!' "I dreamt often of the garden. I may have added to it, I may have changed it; I do not know . . . . . All this you understand is an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early experience. Between that and the other consecutive memories of my boyhood there is a gulf. A time came when it seemed impossible I should ever speak of that wonder glimpse again." I asked an obvious question. "No," he said. "I don't remember that I ever attempted to find my way back to the garden in those early years. This seems odd to me now, but I think that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this misadventure to prevent my going astray. No, it wasn't until you knew me that I tried for the garden again. And I believe there was a period --incredible as it seems now--when I forgot the garden altogether--when I was about eight or nine it may have been. Do you remember me as a kid at Saint Athelstan's?" "Rather!" "I didn't show any signs did I in those days of having a secret dream?" He looked up with a sudden smile. "Did you ever play North-West Passage with me? . . . . . No, of course you didn't come my way!" "It was the sort of game," he went on, "that every imaginative child plays all day. The idea was the discovery of a North-West Passage to school. The way to school was plain enough; the game consisted in finding some way that wasn't plain, starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless direction, and working one's way round through unaccustomed streets to my goal. And one day I got entangled among some rather low-class streets on the other side of Campden Hill, and I began to think that for once the game would be against me and that I should get to school late. I tried rather desperately a street that seemed a cul de sac, and found a passage at the end. I hurried through that with renewed hope. 'I shall do it yet,' I said, and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to me, and behold! there was my long white wall and the green door that led to the enchanted garden! "The thing whacked upon me suddenly. Then, after all, that garden, that wonderful garden, wasn't a dream!" . . . . He paused. "I suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite leisure of a child. Anyhow, this second time I didn't for a moment think of going in straight away. You see . . . For one thing my mind was full of the idea of getting to school in time--set on not breaking my record for punctuality. I must surely have felt SOME little desire at least to try the door--yes, I must have felt that . . . . . But I seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school. I was immediately interested by this discovery I had made, of course--I went on with my mind full of it--but I went on. It didn't check me. I ran past tugging out my watch, found I had ten minutes still to spare, and then I was going downhill into familiar surroundings. I got to school, breathless, it is true, and wet with perspiration, but in time. I can remember hanging up my coat and hat . . . Went right by it and left it behind me. Odd, eh?" He looked at me thoughtfully. "Of course, I didn't know then that it wouldn't always be there. School boys have limited imaginations. I suppose I thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there, to know my way back to it, but there was the school tugging at me. I expect I was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning, recalling what I could of the beautiful strange people I should presently see again. Oddly enough I had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me . . . Yes, I must have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career. "I didn't go that day at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that may have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of inattention brought down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour. I don't know. What I do know is that in the meantime the enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that I could not keep it to myself. "I told--What was his name?--a ferrety-looking youngster we used to call Squiff." "Young Hopkins," said I. "Hopkins it was. I did not like telling him, I had a feeling that in some way it was against the rules to tell him, but I did. He was walking part of the way home with me; he was talkative, and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of something else, and it was intolerable to me to think about any other subject. So I blabbed. "Well, he told my secret. The next day in the play interval I found myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys, half teasing and wholly curious to hear more of the enchanted garden. There was that big Fawcett--you remember him?--and Carnaby and Morley Reynolds. You weren't there by any chance? No, I think I should have remembered if you were . . . . . "A boy is a creature of odd feelings. I was, I really believe, in spite of my secret self-disgust, a little flattered to have the attention of these big fellows. I remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the praise of Crawshaw--you remember Crawshaw major, the son of Crawshaw the composer?--who said it was the best lie he had ever heard. But at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what I felt was indeed a sacred secret. That beast Fawcett made a joke about the girl in green--." Wallace's voice sank with the keen memory of that shame. "I pretended not to hear," he said. "Well, then Carnaby suddenly called me a young liar and disputed with me when I said the thing was true. I said I knew where to find the green door, could lead them all there in ten minutes. Carnaby became outrageously virtuous, and said I'd have to--and bear out my words or suffer. Did you ever have Carnaby twist your arm? Then perhaps you'll understand how it went with me. I swore my story was true. There was nobody in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby though Crawshaw put in a word or so. Carnaby had got his game. I grew excited and red-eared, and a little frightened, I behaved altogether like a silly little chap, and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden, I led the way presently--cheeks flushed, ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul one burning misery and shame--for a party of six mocking, curious and threatening school-fellows. "We never found the white wall and the green door . . ." "You mean?--"  "I mean I couldn't find it. I would have found it if I could. "And afterwards when I could go alone I couldn't find it. I never found it. I seem now to have been always looking for it through my school-boy days, but I've never come upon it again." "Did the fellows--make it disagreeable?" "Beastly . . . . . Carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying. I remember how I sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering. But when I cried myself to sleep at last it wasn't for Carnaby, but for the garden, for the beautiful afternoon I had hoped for, for the sweet friendly women and the waiting playfellows and the game I had hoped to learn again, that beautiful forgotten game . . . . . "I believed firmly that if I had not told-- . . . . . I had bad times after that--crying at night and woolgathering by day. For two terms I slackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It was you--your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the grind again." For a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire. Then he said: "I never saw it again until I was seventeen. "It leapt upon me for the third time--as I was driving to Paddington on my way to Oxford and a scholarship. I had just one momentary glimpse. I was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette, and no doubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world, and suddenly there was the door, the wall, the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable things. "We clattered by--I too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were well past and round a corner. Then I had a queer moment, a double and divergent movement of my will: I tapped the little door in the roof of the cab, and brought my arm down to pull out my watch. 'Yes, sir!' said the cabman, smartly. 'Er-- well--it's nothing,' I cried. 'My mistake! We haven't much time! Go on!' and he went on . . . "I got my scholarship. And the night after I was told of that I sat over my fire in my little upper room, my study, in my father's house, with his praise--his rare praise--and his sound counsels ringing in my ears, and I smoked my favourite pipe--the formidable bulldog of adolescence--and thought of that door in the long white wall. 'If I had stopped,' I thought, 'I should have missed my scholarship, I should have missed Oxford--muddled all the fine career before me! I begin to see things better!' I fell musing deeply, but I did not doubt then this career of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice. "Those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me, very fine, but remote. My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw another door opening--the door of my career." He stared again into the fire. Its red lights picked out a stubborn strength in his face for just one flickering moment, and then it vanished again. "Well", he said and sighed, "I have served that career. I have done--much work, much hard work. But I have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand dreams, and seen its door, or at least glimpsed its door, four times since then. Yes--four times. For a while this world was so bright and interesting, seemed so full of meaning and opportunity that the half-effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote. Who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men? I came down to London from Oxford, a man of bold promise that I have done something to redeem. Something--and yet there have been disappointments . . . . . "Twice I have been in love--I will not dwell on that--but once, as I went to someone who, I know, doubted whether I dared to come, I took a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near Earl's Court, and so happened on a white wall and a familiar green door. 'Odd!' said I to myself, 'but I thought this place was on Campden Hill. It's the place I never could find somehow--like counting Stonehenge--the place of that queer day dream of mine.' And I went by it intent upon my purpose. It had no appeal to me that afternoon. "I had just a moment's impulse to try the door, three steps aside were needed at the most--though I was sure enough in my heart that it would open to me--and then I thought that doing so might delay me on the way to that appointment in which I thought my honour was involved. Afterwards I was sorry for my punctuality--I might at least have peeped in I thought, and waved a hand to those panthers, but I knew enough by this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking. Yes, that time made me very sorry . . . . . "Years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door. It's only recently it has come back to me. With it there has come a sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world. I began to think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should never see that door again. Perhaps I was suffering a little from overwork--perhaps it was what I've heard spoken of as the feeling of forty. I don't know. But certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently, and that just at a time with all these new political developments --when I ought to be working. Odd, isn't it? But I do begin to find life toilsome, its rewards, as I come near them, cheap. I began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly. Yes--and I've seen it three times." "The garden?" "No--the door! And I haven't gone in!" He leaned over the table to me, with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he spoke. "Thrice I have had my chance--thrice! If ever that door offers itself to me again, I swore, I will go in out of this dust and heat, out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these toilsome futilities. I will go and never return. This time I will stay . . . . . I swore it and when the time came-- I didn't go. "Three times in one year have I passed that door and failed to enter. Three times in the last year. "The first time was on the night of the snatch division on the Tenants' Redemption Bill, on which the Government was saved by a majority of three. You remember? No one on our side--perhaps very few on the opposite side--expected the end that night. Then the debate collapsed like eggshells. I and Hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at Brentford, we were both unpaired, and we were called up by telephone, and set off at once in his cousin's motor. We got in barely in time, and on the way we passed my wall and door--livid in the moonlight, blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it, but unmistakable. 'My God!' cried I. 'What?'said Hotchkiss. 'Nothing!' I answered, and the moment passed. "'I've made a great sacrifice,' I told the whip as I got in. 'They all have,' he said, and hurried by. "I do not see how I could have done otherwise then. And the next occasion was as I rushed to my father's bedside to bid that stern old man farewell. Then, too, the claims of life were imperative. But the third time was different; it happened a week ago. It fills me with hot remorse to recall it. I was with Gurker and Ralphs--it's no secret now you know that I've had my talk with Gurker. We had been dining at Frobisher's, and the talk had become intimate between us. The question of my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion. Yes --yes. That's all settled. It needn't be talked about yet, but there's no reason to keep a secret from you . . . . . Yes--thanks! thanks! But let me tell you my story. "Then, on that night things were very much in the air. My position was a very delicate one. I was keenly anxious to get some definite word from Gurker, but was hampered by Ralphs' presence. I was using the best power of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously directed to the point that concerns me. I had to. Ralphs' behaviour since has more than justified my caution . . . . . Ralphs, I knew, would leave us beyond the Kensington High Street, and then I could surprise Gurker by a sudden frankness. One has sometimes to resort to these little devices. . . . . And then it was that in the margin of my field of vision I became aware once more of the white wall, the green door before us down the road. "We passed it talking. I passed it. I can still see the shadow of Gurker's marked profile, his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose, the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and Ralphs' as we sauntered past. "I passed within twenty inches of the door. 'If I say good-night to them, and go in,' I asked myself, 'what will happen?' And I was all a-tingle for that word with Gurker. "I could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems. 'They will think me mad,' I thought. 'And suppose I vanish now!--Amazing disappearance of a prominent politician!' That weighed with me. A thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis." Then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile, and, speaking slowly; "Here I am!" he said. "Here I am!" he repeated, "and my chance has gone from me. Three times in one year the door has been offered me--the door that goes into peace, into delight, into a beauty beyond dreaming, a kindness no man on earth can know. And I have rejected it, Redmond, and it has gone--" "How do you know?" "I know. I know. I am left now to work it out, to stick to the tasks that held me so strongly when my moments came. You say, I have success--this vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing. I have it." He had a walnut in his big hand. "If that was my success," he said, and crushed it, and held it out for me to see. "Let me tell you something, Redmond. This loss is destroying me. For two months, for ten weeks nearly now, I have done no work at all, except the most necessary and urgent duties. My soul is full of inappeasable regrets. At nights--when it is less likely I shall be recognised--I go out. I wander. Yes. I wonder what people would think of that if they knew. A Cabinet Minister, the responsible head of that most vital of all departments, wandering alone--grieving--sometimes near audibly lamenting--for a door, for a garden!" I can see now his rather pallid face, and the unfamiliar sombre fire that had come into his eyes. I see him very vividly to-night. I sit recalling his words, his tones, and last evening's Westminster Gazette still lies on my sofa, containing the notice of his death. At lunch to-day the club was busy with him and the strange riddle of his fate. They found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near East Kensington Station. It is one of two shafts that have been made in connection with an extension of the railway southward. It is protected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road, in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the workmen who live in that direction. The doorway was left unfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers, and through it he made his way . . . . . My mind is darkened with questions and riddles. It would seem he walked all the way from the House that night--he has frequently walked home during the past Session--and so it is I figure his dark form coming along the late and empty streets, wrapped up, intent. And then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough planking into a semblance of white? Did that fatal unfastened door awaken some memory? Was there, after all, ever any green door in the wall at all? I do not know. I have told his story as he told it to me. There are times when I believe that Wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless trap, but that indeed is not my profoundest belief. You may think me superstitious if you will, and foolish; but, indeed, I am more than half convinced that he had in truth, an abnormal gift, and a sense, something--I know not what--that in the guise of wall and door offered him an outlet, a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and altogether more beautiful world. At any rate, you will say, it betrayed him in the end. But did it betray him? There you touch the inmost mystery of these dreamers, these men of vision and the imagination. We see our world fair and common, the hoarding and the pit. By our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness, danger and death. But did he see like that?  Good, eh? If you would like to read more of his stuff, go to a library.

      Some thoughts. I realise these may be direct contradiction my 'I hate that bloody story about the donkey' post, but these I like:  The believer is happy. The doubter is wise. You never test the depth of a river with both feet. Hear and you forget; see and you remember; do and you understand. To be loved is to be fortunate, but to be hated is to achieve distinction. A friend is someone who doesn't like the same people you do

      Hmm. Out of sheer boredom, and the fact that I can't be bothered to face 'Discuss the possible benefits and negative impacts of opening a caravan park (12)', I shall waffle on in a manner not unbefitting of  urlLink some really boring people.  (Aha. Just my little joke.  I should probably put some fancy stuff on here...but instead I'll fantasise. What would I like? 1. Have a giant floating sky fortress. 2. Have a massive submarine. 3. Have a really massive tank. 4. Have my own private army. 5. Have a REALLY big fortress, that I shall label 'The Nearly Impregnable Fortress', in accordance with  urlLink Peter's Evil Overlord List    Of course there is more.

      Bloody computers. My Internet recently crashed. My ISP and phone company went running round, each blaming the other. My quarrel is not with them, I think they did well, I couldn't have done better. Anyway, it turned out the problem was my modem had crashed. For no reason. I mean, I did everything I was meant to with it. It brought to mind these two quotes: 'If cars had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon, and once a week exploded, killing everybody inside.' 'What kind of a world would it be if you got up, had breakfast, got dressed, did up your shoelaces the normal way, and they refused to work? If your shoelaces just wouldn't tie up?'

      TRAILERS. Aren't trailers great? I was watching my Kill Bill trailer, and thought: 'What a perfect piece of cinematography.' Trailers are usually perfect. They encapsulate every good part of a film inside two, and at the most three, minutes. The film they refer to is often long, boring and dull. The film I salivate in anticipation of currently is 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'. And why? Because of the trailer. I watch 3 times a week at skycaptain.com . It looks fantastic. The sets, the thirties-ness, the style...but I'll bet it's crap.

      So. I'm posting again, really more because I feel I should than because I have anything to say. Let's see what it throws up. I have just read this: 'OK, a short post now. GUYS BLOG!! The best maintained blog i have seen is Stompp's, who has posted every day of his blog! Come on guys, he already overtaken Nonnesuch!!  These people MUST post in the next 48 hours, or they shall be brutally bished:  Megatrobe Teradud (who must also shut that bloodt cantina up, before i send ETA there) Nonnesuch Wendy'  This is a little unfair. I never have anything to say, so don't. Meh. I have AN IDEA now though. Should be a post soon after this.

      Well, I just answered the Random Question 'You've written a hit musical! How will you avoid having fame go to your head?' on  urlLink My Profile . I said that I'd try. But considering I've only written three songs in my life, one being 'Bier, Bier, Bier, ich trinke gern viele Bier!!!' and another being 'He's So Great', an ode to my greatness, I think I'm entitled to some head-fame. Of course, the poor medium of electrons hitting a phosphorescent screen cannot truly capture the fireworks, elephants and cannon, but here are the approxiamate lyrics:  HE'S SO GREAT (An ode to the my Greatness)(Abridged Version)  *Orchestra and Brass Band start up. Choirs (3 of them, 1000 strong each) begin to sing:* He's so great, he's so great, I can't believe he's so great, He-e-e is so great, can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great, He-e-e is so great!!  *Tap Dancers (1000 on each staircase) parade down double-staircase. They too join in the second verse:* I can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He is rea-ll-y great!! Can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He-e-e is so great!!  *Brass bands (2 of them, each of 250 men) march in to accompany those already onstage. The tap dancers form huge dance lines:* He's so great, he's so great, I can't believe he's so great, He-e-e is so great, can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great, He-e-e is so great!!  *1000 tap dancing elephants can-can onto the stage:* I can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He is rea-ll-y great!! Can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He-e-e is so great!!  1st Choir: He's so great! 3rd Choir: He's so great! 2nd Choir: He's so great, great great!! Everyone: He-e-e is so great!! 1st Choir: He's so great! 3rd Choir: He's so great! 2nd Choir: He's so great, great great!! Single Opera singer: He-e-e-e-e-e-e-E-E-E-E-e-e iiiiiiiihhhhhsssss sssssooooOOOO GRRRE-e-E-e-a-A-a-A-TTT!!!!! 1st Choir: He's so great! 3rd Choir: He's so great! 2nd Choir: He's so great, great great!! All singers together, as music reaches its climax, which puts even the rest of the amazing spectacle to shame, and also as a giant picture of me unfurls at the back of the stage, spotlights shine upon it, fireworks go off, creating vast indoor explosions, and incidently setting the roof on fire, and cannon and guns go off, making clouds of smoke and demolishing vital supports: He-e-e-e-e-e-e-E-E-E-E-e-e iiiiiiiihhhhhsssss sssssooooOOOO GRRRRrrrrrRRRRR-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-a-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-ttttTTTTTTTT!!!!!  *I, the only patron of the vast theatre which seats 100,000 claps wildly, as the performers gasp for breath.*

      Sigh. As you may well have deduced, oh wise reader that you are, by reading my various friends' Blogs, I am on study leave. Wonderful. I'm actually revising too. Though I am now able to watch the schools pragrammes. Ah, happy days...remember when Teach put your class in front of the telly, with something about 'Magic E' playing, and it wasn't a warning about drugs? Well, I now have the liberty of learning about it all again. I've seen Maths Mansion in which a frankly deranged aristocrat kidnaps cheery 8-year-olds and says something like ;'Mwahaha!!! You'll never get out of my Maths Mansion this week, kids! The Maths Maze is ... Long Division!!' Then a helpful bloke comes along, the kids learn how to do division, get past the Maths Maze, and escape. Brilliant. Today's highlight was MegaMaths:  Schools: Megamaths Tue 25 May, 11:10 am - 11:30 am  20mins  [Age 7-9] Division. Divide by 3: The King of Spades discovers his ancestors' treasure chest and he and his wife and daughter attempt to divide its contents by three.  Truly excellent. A bunch of people dressed as the King of Hearts, Queen of Spades, live in Tabletop Mountain, where they are amused by acrobats with numbers on them, who dance about, dividing each other, much to everyone's delight. Production values are pretty good. They stretched out dividing by three over half an hour. But no final comment of 'And next week, integration: Integrate between 4 and -2 for 4x - x^2 - (x^2 - 16) dx !  P.s. You may also notice that I have, after some help from  urlLink Megatrobe , I have managed to enable YOU, the lucky reader, to comment on my Blog. You can also mail me, by looking to the left, coping and pasting my E-mail address, taking out the rubbish (*'s and spaces). Anyway, do what thou willst.

      Today: Goths and Wicca, etc. Yes, they really annoy me. And what is most annoying is that they seem to want to do it to stand out, be special. To be non-conformists. And what are they? Conformists to non-conformism. The TRUE non-conformist does not bother to state their non-conformity in any special way. They are confident in their lifestyle, and are happy with what they are. And they are un-labelablebleble... Sorry to bring up this argument, but it does lead on rather nicely to a richer seam. Most people who turn up to 'goth' boards generally open with 'if i had to say i was nething i ould b a goth but i think that lablss r stupid and evri1 is differnt ' (sic. all the way through). But then I bet that if you went round to these peoples' houses you would find Nike bags, Adidas trainers, McDonald's packaging... Everyone is the same. They all conform to what their friends want and expect, and give little care for their own feelings. (To sound worringly like a pop-psychologist.) And they TRY to justify it; 'Yes, but if I have a really good bag from Nike then everyone thinks I am -' 'A brainwashed idiot who believes the tide of marketing that spews forth from the TV?' '- really cool.' It's all so depressing.

      Hooray!! GCSEs finished. A great sense of relief. I expect my posts over the next few weeks will be full of information about stuff I am doing, so no need to bore you with it now. So, instead, here is:   NONNESUCH'S GUIDE TO FRENCH!!   A compilation of all the French phrases you will ever need. (Translated by  urlLink AltaVista , so it's probably not much good.)      Shut up, you garlic-eating surrender monkey! ;  Ferme-la, vous ail-mangeant le singe de reddition!   Your country is like a toilet, it doesn't need a president, just someone to flush all the shit away. ;  Votre pays est comme une toilette, il le besoin de doesn't un président, juste quelqu'un de rincer toute la merde loin.   Honestly, officer, his face was like that when I met him. ;  Honnêtement, l'officier, son visage était comme celui quand je l'ai rencontré.   Where I come from, incest is not encouraged. ;  De là où je viens, l'inceste n'est pas encouragé.   Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries! ;  Votre mère était un hamster, et votre éperlan de père des baies de sureau!   I hate you, I hate your country, I hate your language, I hate your food, and I hate your face. ;  Je vous déteste, je déteste votre pays, je déteste votre langue, je déteste votre nourriture, et je déteste votre visage.   You are going home in an ambulance. ;  Vous entrez à la maison dans une ambulance.    If you can think of any more, why not add them via the Comments link below?

      Yay!! Nearly done. Only 3 more GCSEs to go, and one of them is Maths Statistics Foundation. Considering that I'm in Set 1 of 8 for maths, and I recently sat the bloody Additional Maths Paper (Question one: 'Prove by any means that the sides of a triangle that can be written as x^2, (2x)+2 (2x)-2 is right angled.'), it brings a warm glow to my heart when I see a question such as '48% of tourists holiday in England. What percentage do not?'. And I did the Chemistry Triple this morning. I didn't get onlt one question: 'How is ethene turned to ethanol for industry.' I didn't know. I still don't. I don't care. I never have to know or care again. Ahh... Gosh. What a dull post. Anyway, the ones in the holidays, when I have loads of spare time should fairly glow with wit and suprise. Goodbye readers!! (I know I have 7 returning visitors. And only 6 of those could be friends. So I have at least one fan. Go me!!)

      ARARARAGGHHH!!!  urlLink CHRISTIAN BRAINWASHING!!!!!  I hate bloody radical Christians. I hate them. I really do. Especially gay-bashing, if only because that is the one that has had a lot of debate about it recently. On  urlLink NationStates 's Forums, there are a great many debates about the whole issue or aspects of it. They're generally all very good. I don't comment in them, but I have some views on the whole thing that I think I should get down. I have nothing against Christianity  per se . Its underlying message of love and how great Jesus was/is is fine by me. What I can't stand is the Bible. True, it says being gay is bad. In Leviticus 18:22; 'Thou shalt not lie with a man as you shall with a woman. That is an abomination' (or similar, depending on which version of the Bible you are using). This is the most obvious reference. HOWEVER, Leviticus also lays down a number of other laws. Hey, have you read these? You are a sinner comparable to gays if you have eaten the fat or blood of a lamb or cow (Lev 3:17). If you're male, have you been circumcised? If so, was it on the 8th day after your birth? If you answered 'No' to either of these questions, you're a sinner (Lev 12:3). Is that a cotton and polyester shirt you're wearing? Sorry, THAT'S a sin too; no garments made of more than one fabric for you! (Lev 19:19). And have you had a haircut or a shave at all. Guess what? It's a sin (Lev 19:27). And do you observe all the holy days laid out in Leviticus 23:5 onwards? To not do so is a, guess what?; SIN! So, logically, if this Jack Chick person is wearing a cotton and polyester shirt, well, he's just as bad as gays, in his own eyes. Deary deary me. Convenient he doesn't bring this up in his little cartoon. The little Christian girl in the cartoon also says (near the bottom) 'If anyone tries to make  you  gay,  stay away  from them!'. The amount of wrong-ness in that statement is incredible. From what I've read, heard, etc., being gay is  not a choice . All gays I have talked with claim they realised they were gay, and always had been in their teens, the time when most people realise their sexuality (in a non-orientation sense). The best analogy I've ever heard of it is 'it is like being left-handed'. Sure, you can cover it up and pretend you're not your whole life, but you cannot ever change. You are in the minority, most people are different in that respect, but this is a very minor difference in an ocean of similarity. And 'make you gay'? I sympathise completely. Why, you can hardly move nowadays for people pouncing on you and attepting to brainwash you into becoming a gay. Did I say 'becoming a gay'? I meant 'becoming an Evangelical'. A little further down, little Susy says 'I feel so sad about all the kids who'll be tricked into believing its OK to be Gay (capital letter, strange) and  not  believing in Jesus.' Well, being gay (or Gay) is not exclusive of believing in Jesus. The implication is that if you are not the ultra-radical Christian Jack is, your a sinner and going to Hell. He says that non-Christians will not go to Heaven. Now this may be the case. urlLink Here  we have a little story about how the Qu'ran (not Koran) and Islam are wrong. 'Hey' says the Christian 'your religion is wrong, founded on previous religions, and is condemned by the Bible!' 'Goodness me!' exclaims the Muslim, 'so it is! I see now my entire life has been based on a lie. I will instantly renounce my religion, ignore all the parts of the Qu'ran that claim the same of Christianity, and convert!!'   My favourite exchange is this:  Muslim : 'And Jesus can't be God's son, because the [Qu'ran] declares 'SAY NOT ALLAH BEGOT A SON'.  Christian : 'That's no problem sir, becuase Allah is NOT God.'  The next part can be summed up as:   Muslim : 'I see you're right! I'll gladly take your religion's word over mine's!' Strewth. If this Muslim is so confident about his religion (as in panel 3), why does he renounce it after the shortest of speeches from a Christian? I'm atheist, and surely with no prior allegiance I should be easier to convert, but it'd take a lot more than 'look what the Bible says' to convince me, given the amount of crap in it. (See above) I don't want you to get me wrong, I am not pro-Islam or anti-Christianity, I try to be impartial to religions, it's just that the people who tout them seem to be, nearly without exception, idiots.  I mean, look at  urlLink this . It reveals that those nations who do not support Isreal are cursed by God. It is becuase of this curse the British Empire collapsed (well, all those other therories are out the window), why many African countries are suffering drought and famine (but Somalia is in a civil war, and they never did anything to Isreal), why Russia is in 'the mess it is today' (seems fine to me, after it renounced Communism) and America is merely 'a puppet of the UN' (and we can clearly see that in the way the UN instantly stopped all plans for the USA to invade Iraq.). Further idiocy can be found  urlLink here , where a 12-year-old demolishes evolution. It's a shame that his teacher is such a moron that he cannot provide other examples of man's evolution from apes, doesn't bring up the theories behind carbon-dating, doesn't mention that trees could have fallen into cracks, BE millions of years old, bring up bone structure in animals, Darwin's Theory of Evolution Through Natural Selection, or show that most 'Deep Physics' is based on theory, and there may be a better one than 'gluons'. If Heaven is populated with the likes of Jack, then God can't be that great. An incredible array of stupid cartoons will be added as I find them: 1.  urlLink Dungeons and Dragons = Witchcraft  2.  urlLink God can kill you for ignorance.  Shame. Think of all those Christians who don't know about the Cotton and Polyester Shirt Sin. 3.  urlLink Being a good person is no match for being an adequete one who believes in Jesus . 4.  urlLink A fanatical Muslim has the joke on him when he gets sent to Hell! Hahaha!!    5.  urlLink Judaism is wrong.  6.  urlLink Looks like evolution is pretty easy to debunk. No mention of carbon-dating...  7.  urlLink How to defeat your kidnappers by teaching them about Christ.  8.  urlLink Witches, blah.  Well, this is a particularly stupid one. 'Witches will go to Hell!'. Yeah, well, everyone goes to Hell, so what's new? (Seems a little unfair that everyone gets the same punishment. And why did God create Hell in the first place? And why did He make man imperfect? And why hasn't He stop Satan? And why does He allow suffering? Can you remember what I was saying before I opened these brackets?) But this is stupid, as I said. How can you on the one hand say 'All other religions are false', and on the other 'Witchcraft works'? ('Something powerful is blocking my spell' implies that there is a spell to block.) And it has the old 'anything new is Satan' line. In this, it's Harry Potter, the speccy embodiment of Beelezbub on Earth, of course. Goodness me (Well, you try not using the Lord's name in vain), I wonder how many Christians have been turned to Satan by J.K Rowling's evil creation? I'd say none. Only Christians count, as the others were going to go to Hell anyway. Of course, 'witches' are equally stupid, if not more so. Most religions are silly, Wicca is sillier than most. Up yours, Jack.

      Wow. Two posts in one day. It's a wonder I haven't collapsed from exhaustion. Anyway, this is a general-purpose post. I've been reading the Blogs on the right, through the links. It's recently occured to me how good they are. They're all jolly good, in fact. Better than a great many Blogs out there. I recommend them. Read them. On a different note, I've been thinking about music a lot recently. I hate most modern music. Loathe it. But through the constant exposure to it that a modern, non-hermatic life entails, it's suprising how many good modern songs there are out there. Most artists (or their writers) produce something that makes me long for the the sound of a bag of cats being smashed repeatedly into a wall, or the same song in barely disguised lyrics, such as Busted. However, several songs that I have really liked have come from 'artists' that are otherwise totally crap. I really like . urlLink 'Unemployed Boyfriend'  by  urlLink Everclear  (Ugly bunch, aren't they?) and also  urlLink Connection  by  urlLink Elastica , better known as the Trigger Happy TV theme music. It's better after the opening riff, though. Otherwise, the songs on the same albums are the tuneless dirges I have come to expect from modern bands. So how could they write such good songs? This may be due to the 'thousand monkeys at a thousand typewriters effect', who as everyone knows will eventually produce the greatest novel known to man, through random chance. Or maybe (a shocking thought to be sure) they actually have some talent? But in that case, why produce the dirges? It looks like it's the monkeys, I'm afraid. P.s. I don't like modern music. A sample from my collection:  Jimmy Shand Lemon Jelly - Nice Weather For Ducks Jung-Hwa Ban Jum Marvin - Reasons to be Miserable Abbot and Costello - Who's On First Lynrd Skyrd - Sweet Home Alabama Jurassic Park Theme - Techno Remix. Case closed. (Not a song).

      After seeing it on  urlLink Astrojaxx's Blog , and given my love of Latin, I took the 'Which Weird Latin Phrase Are You?' test. Isn't it amazing how many ways the Internet can waste our time. Anyway, I think I beat her 'Furnulum pani nolo. "I don't want a toaster."'  Magister Mundi sum! "I am the Master of the Universe!" You are full of yourself, but you're so cool you probably deserve to be.

      Sigh. I'm really bored. There's only so much 'What are the 2 ways of extracting metals from their ores? Name 3 metals extracted by each method. What metal is found pure?' that you can take. So, Time For A Blog.  A Typical Rugby Lesson   As you may or may not know, I have had my last ever rugby lesson. Ahh... So, now seems a good time to recount my experiences.   Scene:  A windblown rubgy pitch. It is lashing with rain. Dark clouds thunder overhead, and flashes of lightning illuminate the clutch of boys that shiver in a huddle, trying desparately to keep warm hemhem.   Nonnesuch:  (All names changed to their online equivalent.)(Yelling to his friends above the wind.)  Bloody awful, isn't it? And I bet the teacher will come along now in 23 layers!  Lightning strikes the ground in front of them. When the glow dissapates, the P.E teacher, Horrible, is seen walking towards them, with a crowd of underlings weighted down under huge bags of rugby balls, foam armour, etc. As predicted, he is wearing 23 layers.   Horrible:  All right, you scum, you vermin!! Run around that tree, and back!! NOW!!!  Wearily, the boys run off. Occaisonallly one falls into the quagmire of mud, and is trampled underfoot. The rest ignore their piteous screams.   Horrible:  Right! How many of you survive?! NOW we will run around in little cricles, ORRIGHT!?!? NOW, skip like little GIRLS, you SCUM!!! NOW we have finished warming up,  (Irony of ironies. The boys are now colder than ever. The rain has now turned to freezing slush, and any warmth has now seeped out of their bodies.)  we will commence with the lesson!! I will divide HYU up into 2 teams!! OK, Masher, Smasher, Cruncher, Killer, Grinder, Pounder, Mauler, Slicer, Dicer, you can be Team One!! Now, TeraDud, Nonnesuch, Flinn, DickyBod, Jani and MegaTrobe, HYU can be Team Two!! Team two, put on the padding!!  They do so. It is flimsy and resticts movement. On the othehand, it allows body temperature to be raised to 270 Kelvin.   Horrible:  Now, your task is to prevent Team One getting through your blockade! Team One, tackle them and ruck over!!!  Team One:  RRRRRAAARRRRGGHHHH!!!!  Team Two:  AAAAAAhhhAAAAAHHHH!!!!  Team One Charge. They smash the first two defenders aside as though they were matchsticks.   Nonnesuch:  (To himself)  Come on, I can do this. I can do this.  Killer throws him aside like a matchstick. He lands in a pool of mud.   Horrible:  Excellent, Team One! I reward you for having bloodthirsty instincts and murderous intent!! Now, swap round!!  Team Two, as one man, charge at Masher, the first defender.   Team Two:  AAARRFGGHHH!!! Ow!!  (They bounce off.)   Masher:  Hur, hur, hur.  Horrible:  Idiots!! We're not here to mess around!! Do it again, properly!!!  They try again and again. Flinn is taken off in a stre...coffin. They eventually get through. They then retrieve their limbs which were left behind.   Horrible:  Now we have practiced, we will play a game!! This version of the rules is called 'Smash Your Enemies Into A Bloody Pulp Rules Rugby!!' We've all played before!! Now, I will step off the pitch and huddle with the rest of the teachers in our 23 overcoats!! GO!!!  The game is a massacre. Duh. However, the Duds are jubliant when they finish.                     THE END

      Greetings, my fans. Yes, both of you. This is a post to apologise for the recent lack of posts. As you may be aware from reading my friends' Blogs, we are in the middle of our GCSEs chiz. Anyway, this is way I don't have the time. But as usual, I am beseiged with ideas, and have written them down. They will be posted in ... ooh ... 3 weeks' time. Until then, I suggest you learn to juggle. Or learn Pi.

       OK, due to popular-ish demand, I will ramble on about my holiday a bit. OK, where to begin. At the beginning, of course! The plane flight was OK, they had a couple of good movies. I saw  Hellboy . It's not out in England for another month. Nyah. It wasn't great. It didn't take itself too seriously though, which was nice. Anyway, upon arrival in Antananarivo (known as Tana, to keep it short) after a fairly boring stopover in Johannesburg, we were met by our guide, Lalayna (phonetically), a sober young man with excellent English. After changing our money and fighting off hoards of porters, we were driven by our driver Lala (no, really) to some place about 50 km away. Observations:       Many people are on foot.     Everyone is making bricks.     There are paddyfields everywhere.     The drivers are maniacs.    It reminds me most of what I've seen of Brazil on Geography case studies mixed with China.      After sleeping in a nondescript hotel, we drove to Ranomafana (Rano = Water, Mafana = Hot) the next day. It is a rainforest. There are hot springs nearby. It rained a lot. Constantly, in fact. We went around the forest three times. We saw:     Lemurs.     Chameleons.     Leaf geckos - They look  exactly  like bark on trees.     Moss.     Trees.     Bamboo.     Rain.      Then we went somewhere else, I don't remember where, then to Isalo. It's a national park filled with weird sandstone shapes, carved by the wind. Neat. We walked around there for a day, then we went to the seaside, near the Spiny Forest. It is a forest, in which everything is spiny. Someone showed us the uses for all the trees and plants. Then we flew to Tana, looked in one of their tiny museums, and then flew to an amazingly posh hotel. Imagine those ones in the movies of brilliant Caribbean resorts, but even better. The waiters hung around, refilling your glasses, which was annoying. They did have some good books there, though. I recommend  urlLink Tom Holt , and I disrecommend  urlLink Janny Wurts .   They had a variety of nice things to do. I failed miserably at waterskiing, saw fossilised lemur skulls, and went swimming a lot.    Er... then to another rainforest (getting a bit boring by now), and home. Saw  Shaun of the Dead . Pretty good.    Please note this is by no means complete. There are huge chunks missing, and I'll elaborate on any aspect that you like upon request.

      I'm going to Madagascar on Monday. I will be back on the 31st. I'm looking forward to some things, not to others. I do like air travel. Aaahh... Being compressed into a seat smaller than the ones on the train, eating microwaved rubber, and emerging from a sleepless delirium to find yourself somewhere awful. Wonderful. Still, airplane radio is good. I usually like at least one song on it. Or the microscopic TV in the headrest ahead of me. Oh well. See you in 3 weeks, then. Fond farewells, my friends. Leave any well-wishing by Commenting.

      In totally unrelated news, I am at work on a film script and a novel. I have done one paragraph of the novel, and hastily bashed together some ideas. Publication is estimated by the year 2050. The film will be the greatest ever. It is due to start filming after I've written the remaining 1,499.5 pages of script (it's a very long film), worked out the plot, got the actors, a director, film crew, money, publishing rights, copyright, my family's blessing, cameras and movie-making equipment, a place to film, and a plan. Filming is due to start in 2055, after my book tour and when the special effects will be what I need. You may apply for parts now, however. We currently need actors/actresses for the following:      Priestly drag queens.  Robot scientists (if robots have been invented by 2055, this part will not be available).  Man who laughs in the face of Danger.  Fleeing refugee No. 45,135.

      Words I like. I'll hopefully update it from time to time. Add your own with the Comments link.  Orrey - One of those nice fancy clockwork planet thingies. Prerequisite - Required or necessary as a prior condition. Imperopedantpartoaristarcracy - An imperial system of ruling by a perfect, unopposed party that is needlessly concerned with bureaucracy. Malodorous - Smelling bad. Tulgey - Possibly 'bulgey' and another word. Vorpal - Deadly? A kind of metal? Frabjous - Wonderful. No idea what it means. Probably 'worth celebrating'.

       I stole this from  urlLink fpoole , but it is so great that I think more people need to see it. All 10 extra people that visit my Blog per week.      "We succeeded in taking that picture [from deep space], and, if you look at it, you see a dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam. The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It's been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known." - Carl Sagan,   urlLink  Reflections on a Mote of Dust

       I hate modern art. I know that is by no means an original statement, but it is a true one. As you will no doubt be aware from reading  urlLink Megatrobe's Blog  and  urlLink Teradud's Blog , I and my friends visited the Tate Modern recently. We wandered around 3 floors, and I saw 2 things I liked. One was 'International Klein Blue', a square of a shade of blue invented by somebody Klein. It does not purport to be art. The other was a big metal spider-thing.   Now, the main problem I have with modern art is, although it carries a message, it is appallingly communicated. For example, there was a room full of mannequins picking up 'litter' of little cut-outs of people, and recycling them. It showed how the Thatcher Government sacrificed people in favour of the economy. Fair enough. But what is wrong with the artist writing a short essay, essentially saying just that? It's such a waste of resources! And although most of the art, when analysed, shows a deep message, you do have to think about it. And in many cases it could be ANY message. Ones that eluded my analysis were:     Two big towers, that changed colours.     An air-conditioning unit. It was art. Next to it, on the floor, was a  real  air unit. It wasn't art. Hmm.     A room full of pictures of squares, vaguely painted.     A video of a corkscrew being slowly moved about in front of a cheesegrater. I've no idea either.     A video of a bowl of rotting fruit. I had one on my old CD encyclopaedia, but it wasn't art, for some reason.      The list goes on. I suspect these modern artists think an idea up, then let other people analyse it.

       Time for another couple of rants, methinks. (I love that word. It doesn't sound like a real word, bt it is! Oh, rapture! Where was I? Oh yes.) I've been playing Neopets (I repent!! I repent!!) a lot recently, what with it being the summer holidays, and I've been in contact with the Neopian population. It is mostly 12-year-old girls. And most of their signatures (little things at the ends of posts, etc.) proclaim that they cannot be labelled. Sample:       "Ok people I don't fit in any of those groups.....I can't be mas produced. I'm an original.LablesAreForCans."         To which I say: Screw you, you whiner. I have labelled you a whiner. Whether you choose to accept the label or not is irrelevent. A label is what I (and probably more people) see you as. In my eyes, you are a whiner, a goth, a fool. It doesn't matter whether you see yourself as this, the fact is that you are, no matter how much you deny it. How often do you see this?:        2 + 2 = 4   - 'No I don't!! I can be whatever I want! I'm not odd  or  even!!'      Never, that's how often. Take note, fools.       ' Neither man nor woman can be worth anything until they have discovered that they are fools.' - William Lamb and Viscount Melbourne.       (Ever notice how people respect your views if you tell them someone else said it? By the way, the above quote IS real.)
