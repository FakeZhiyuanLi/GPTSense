       Well today was a pretty normal day...worked...well I was at work all day, but I wasn't very productive! I emailed a lot and surfed the web a little....*sigh* I need a new job!   After work, picked up my baby and we went to the mall...he has a b-day party to go to tm'w, and so we bought a present for that, as well as some new clothes for both of us...and I bought Norah Jones, Van Morrison, and Barry Manilow cd's.....yes, I love Barry Manilow! I'm not ashamed, he's a great singer & his songs are sweet &amp; catchy.  Anyway...(I'm listening to Norah right now, the song 'What am I to You"...it's on repeat, I want to know it well enough to sing along, all the words!! I just wish I had some wine to drink right now, it would be perfect.  Man, I have so many guys emailing me w/ the online thing, I can hardly keep up with it!! It's carazy.  Today I was talking w/ a girl friend of mine at work, she's a single mom just like I am...and I was telling her how sad I am that I'll never have the blissful time with a mate, you know where you're falling in love and in the early stages of being in love, where you just can't get enough of each other, and you have time to just lay in bed for entire days, and you just wish it could last forever....I'll never have that! I know, I know...that I should count my blessings, which I do have many of...but sometimes I just have to mourn the parts of life that I've given up. I had my son when I was 19 (I know a lot of people think I'm crazy for that) plus I was single (people think I'm even crazier for that!). The truth is, I wasn't ready for a child (I was just getting ready to go into my second year of college), and I actually made an appointment to have the pregnancy terminated...but I couldn't bring myself to go. I just couldn't. Also, the thought occured to me: what if this is my only chance to have a baby? ....and those two things together pretty much made the decision for me.  I have no idea if ANYONE will ever read this, but if anyone does, do you know what synchronicity is? It's when something happens that's like a coincidence, but has a lot more meaning and is just too big to be simple coincidence....like a simple example, is a woman being set up with the same man, several years apart, once on the west coast and once on the east coast! I read that one in a book about synchronicity. Here's another though, and this happened to a friend of mine. We'll call her Lisa. She was engaged, and she and her fiance were planning on getting married in Las Vegas. She ended up breaking off the engagement, but still went to Vegas...on the day she was supposed to get married, she met another guy...in the same place she was supposed to get married! They are in love...and they live in different cities but visit each other. Anyway lots of synchronistic events have happened to me...and I really believe that everything happens for a reason! What about you? Maybe I'll talk more about that later....  So anyway....more on Sam...after that first night together, a couple of weeks later he came to visit his father and myself instead of going to Costa Rica. That weekend we both went out separately Friday night, but met up later....at my place, and the sex was absolutely wonderful again (three times again!) then Saturday he had to get up and work; then he took his papa out to lunch; then, he came back to my place, and we just kinda laid around (we were both tired from the night before!) "You're going to kill me", he says.....anyway, we just laid around, talked....talked about going to a movie, but decided to just lay around instead, which we did...just relaxing and talking...then finally we got hungry so we went out to eat, then came back home, had ice cream, and went back to bed....two times that night. It was great. God, it's been months since I saw him, but I STILL fantasize about being naked with him all the time!! He is that good...and it's just the chemistry we have...I've really only had chemistry like it a couple of other times. I don't know how to explain it...but here's a shot: well, for one thing, every time I see him it's raining... every  time! "It's good luck!" he says....and like when we walk down the street together, we have to be touching the whole time...sometimes just holding hands, but also sometimes we're as close as we can be...and we even sometimes kiss while we're walking!..sometimes lingering kisses. I'm not trying to say we're in love, b/c we don't know each other well enough...I'm just saying that it's something different & special. I mean, I've been with Ray several times since the last time I was with Sam...but it just doesn't hold a candle. Ray and I sleep on our own sides of the bed, for the most part...I mean, we might have a leg draped or something...we might even spoon for a bit, but we're not completely entwined the way Sam and I always are! Sometimes I wonder which kind of relationship would be better for a long term thing...the passionate one or the more balanced, even-keeled, friendship-based one? I'm really not sure...I guess both can work, but I'd rather have the passionate one, provided it could last! Oh! I was also gonna describe how when Sam and I are out together, people watch us...I'm sure it's at least partly b/c of the difference in age, but like the last time we were in a restaraunt, and decided to eat at the bar. Well, we sat down, and the woman sitting next to me kept turning around and looking at us, to the point where Sam asked me if I knew what she kept looking at us for. I said no....but I think she was looking to try to figure out what our relationship was...she was probably about his age...so maybe actually she thought he was hot...who knows. Anyway...after I'd had a couple of drinks, I started laying my head on his shoulder and giving him little kisses...and we were tickling each other...he acts like a kid! I love it....anyway, I was giggling and felt just totally happy...it's like we're in our own little world, even though there are people all around....and every once in a while we remember we're in public! So by the end of the time we were there, the bartender was smiling widely at us, as if to say we were cute, or something....the bartender was a man, too. That made me wonder how we must look to other people. Not that I really care too much, if they are chastizing b/c of our ages, but it does make me think about how we are together. It's just sweet.....I wish he lived here. Actually he was coming here fairly often to visit his father, but his father passed away a couple of weeks ago....so I may not be seeing him anymore, which would be really disappointing, but I've realized that it's really true, that people come into your life for a reason...and he and I just seem to have a common thread...we're both very independent, almost to the point of being loners...but we have a great connection-except when we talk on the phone...it's just different. The second night we spent together, he had a dream that we went scuba diving together....the first night together, I told him that I wanted to go, and he said he would like to as well. I thought that was funny. ~Please forgive my rambling~....also, I have to tell about my psychic...first, a little background on her.  My psychic: Joan is her name. She couldn't be any sweeter..she's a grandmother, and you go to her home when she does a reading for you. I never would have gone to a psychic, but a friend of mine and her mother both went to this woman a couple of times, and what they told me about her left me impressed, and so I went to see for myself. Well, after my first visit I was floored....she knew so much about me, the way I am...and she knew my ex's name, and everything she said about him was completely correct...I was amazed. Each time I've gon to her (four times now, I think), she's told me things about the person I'll marry. The first time I went to her I think I was 23. Now I don't believe that people who are psychic have powers that are exact...but I do believe that they can feel things, and sometimes have only hints to work with...so the first time I went to her she told me that the person I'll marry will be just wonderful, he'll love to travel and do stuff, and that he'd come into the picture when I was 26 or 27. She said he'll be wonderful with my son, and everything would be peachy. She also said that she saw his b-day being right after mine. The second time, she told me that he might have a couple of kids ~but she stressed the word might~and she said that he would come into the picture between the end of that year and the middle of the next year (and this was about a year ago, so that would have meant when I was 26 or 27!). ~by the way, "next year" back then is this year...and I just turned 27~ and it's past the middle of the year!!  I don't think that what she says is exact; I just think it's an estimate.  She told a close friend of mine that she would be married in about two years; she got married 2 and a half years later!  (Believe me, like I said my close friend and her mom went to this woman, and two of my friends have gone and were amazed by her as well...and one of those friends has sent two more people to Joan--she's great).  Anyway....every time she's talked about my marriage, she's said that it will be really good, and I'll have everything I want.  OK-SO-the third time, she told me that I'll have a long relationship before I actually get married....b/c I want to be absolutely sure it's right...she also said that I had been wondering if I would ever get married, b/c I've seen alot....and let me tell you she was absolutely right...and what I've seen is men trying to cheat on their wives w/ a teenager (who was me!) and young woman...I had my first married man hit on me when i was 17.  His wife was beautiful, too.  But, I digress...so the third visit w/ Joan...she said again that I actually will get married, maybe not actually married until I'm 31, but like I said, she said I'll have a long relationship w/ this guy before I take the plunge...but she said I'll be able to do what I want...maybe like go back to school and stuff...(I have a degree but would like to go back for my master's) ....and she said I'll only do it once.  I know she said a little more on this visit but I can't remember what else there was...so then on the fourth visit, the most recent one....which was back in May, perhaps...she said that she sees me thinking about settling or getting engaged next fall, and she said again that I'll definitely get married, only once, and she said she saw a lot of stuff w/ flying around him...she said she didn't know if he was a pilot or what, but he flies a lot (which goes w/ what she said about him loving to travel and traveling a lot).... (oh and as a sideline, once I asked her about my ex b/f Mark, and she said that we had a lot of fun together, but that I was better off w/out him b/c he's messed up...then she said, I think you two might have been together in a past life!....and you have to know, that he and I were like best friends right after we met!  It was one of those connections that don't happen every day..he was another guy that I kissed first, and loved to cuddle with and fell in love with...then the last time I saw Joan, she brought him up, and she said he still likes me, and that he's spoiled but cute and she asked if he has light hair and I said yes...she said he'll be crossing my path again...so we'll see if that happens!  I had lots of synchronistic stuff happen w/ him!) okay....back to the original story...she said basically he'll be great, and listen to this: Sam sounds like this guy she's been talking about! here's why: his b-day is early August; mine's late July (she said his b-day would be right after mine) he travels all the time--both for work and for pleasure--probably more than any other person I know the time he came into my life is right so for a while, Sam kinda sounded like my man, except for the thing she said about the kids...  but, one night while we were out, he mentioned to me that he was kind of like a godfather to two kids in another country.... when he told me that, I was like wha-??  ....come again?  It took a minute for that to sink in.  It was a strange feeling...I remembered what Joan told me, and I was like wowie.  Hmmmm......  only time will tell for sure!  Now it's late at night and I must go to sleep...

      So,    here we go!!   Well, I don't claim to be a great writer, or to have a particularly interesting life....but I love writing about myself, and don't mind sharing my experiences with others....actually it sounds great!  Some of what I write will probably be happy, some might be sexy, some of it might be sad...it's just going to be whatever I feel like writing!   A little about me:  age: 27 height: 5'4" weight:  115-117  Hmm, let's see, what else?  Well, I have a lovely, handsome son...but I probably won't talk about him much here.  He's 7 (I had him when I was 19--done the whole thing alone, I may talk more about that, I don't know).  Part of the reason for me having this blog, though, is to nurture myself, as me, not a mom.  Don't get me wrong I love being a mom, but I have to keep my identity as well!   One of the things I really want to talk about (it's totally on my mind today) is sex (& all the things that go with it!)....I have been feeling really excited about exploring my sexuality a little more.  So, for the sake of feeling comfortable writing about that stuff, I'm not going to be putting any picture of myself up here!  I am told that I'm very attractive, though....every once in a while I'm told by complete strangers that I'm beautiful...it's flattering.  Alright well here are some details about two guys who have been in and out of my life for a bit (there's a sort of unusual component with each of them--one is middle eastern  while I'm of European descent; and one is 18 years older than me!):  First, we'll talk about 'Ray'.  I've been seeing him on and off for a little over a year, and he's one of the kindest people you could ever know.  He's from Lebanon, so has an accent, and when I first met him, he wasn't really someone I would look twice at if I were passing him on the street.  Actually, before the first time we went out, I was very hesitant...I can remember talking to my mom, saying that I just didn't want to go....I was very close to calling him and canceling.  But, I went, very reluctantly.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  I had a blast with him...and I had been a little bit afraid that I would feel a little but...well, how can I say...well, I thought I might feel stupid around him, because he's very smart (went to Harvard for part of his training, is now an attending physician at a very reputable university hospital)...but, he doesn't have that effect on me at all; in fact, sometimes he's very scatterbrained, and in some areas my brain works better than his...I think it's just because he's basically abnormally intelligent, though.  Anyway, he's very open-minded which is very important to me.  On our first date, I had fun with him, but I wasn't all that attracted to him....but by the end of our second date, I was starting to feel more attracted to him, & we had sex on the second date.  On our first date, I ended up staying at his place (it was about a 35 min drive home for me, and I'd had pretty much to drink), and in the morning he got up, made me freshly squeezed orange juice, told me I looked even more beautiful in the morning, and took me to breakfast.  Second date, slept together....got taken to breakfast again! Well, over the past year and a few months, we've been on and off (he has someone else he's been on and off with for about the same amount of time).  He broke things off the first couple of times, and I've done it too...and it was funny, we hadn't spoken for about three months or so, and I was out on a date with another guy, and who do you think I run into...Ray, of course.  So he told me that he would like to go out with me again, apologized for how he'd treated me (it was all about the other girl), and said he'd call me.  So, the next night I was out w/ friends, and he called--I couldn't hear, didn't know who it was (I'd erased his ph# from my cell phone), so I said "I'll call you back" and hung up the phone. When I left, I called the number back and recognized his voice.  Well, after I saw him, I had really mixed feelings..on the one hand, I was so excited to see him, and it was great that I looked good, and was out on a date!  So part of me really wanted to go out w/ him again, but part of me was saying, noooo!!  Think of what he did to you before!  good:                                                          always took me to nice places great, great friends! conversation flows well, intelligent & intersting I wanted to!  bad: he ditched me for someone else (but, he  was  honest about it!) he crushed me when he did above...  SO--since I wanted to go out with him, at least as friends, I promised myself that I wouldn't take him seriously.  So when I called the number back and it was him, I went and met up with him.  He ditched his friends, and we met up then went back to his place.  What's he like in bed?  He's very tender, and sweet.  It's always nice to be with him....not particularly passionate, but always tender and sweet.  I think he's spent most of his life focusing on things like school....I have a feeling he was sort of a late bloomer, so I don't think he's all that experienced, although he's 35.  But, what he lacks in technique, he makes up for with sweetness.  So yeah, the night after we ran into each other, we were back in bed!  It was funny.  Also, I was happy because I knew that enough time had passed, that I wasn't hung up on him like I had been before, and actually I felt more free to just be myself and enjoy the time, not worry about what was between us or whatever.   Okay, so now we'll talk a bit about 'Sam': (the first time we met was at the end of Feb.)  This is the guy who's 18 years older than me.  Now, it seems to me like most of the blogs I've seen w/ this setup  are mostly written by people on the east coast....and this guy spends a lot of time there (I live in the midwest), so I have to be extra careful.  I'd be horrified if someone recognized either of these guys, or if one of them recognized themselves & read what I write about them!  Hehe. Anyway....he is in the fashion industry, which I think is super cool b/c he's always dressed w/ style and he's straight.  I met him online.  Here's how it went: Sam sent me a message one day, and I replied...then we ended up chatting once.  I didn't think much about it, b/c of his age and b/c his location is Chicago/ NY.  When we chatted, though, he seemed really funny and pretty unconventional, which I liked...and we exchanged phone #'s....he called a couple of times, but I didn't call him back.  Well, ff a month or so....I had a date set up for a Saturday night with a different guy.  Well, this guy had gone to NY to talk business (he was in school here but planned on moving to NY as soon as he was done).  He was supposed to return on Saturday morning...but he called me Friday night to let me know, he would be staying in NY through the weekend.  So, I was disappointed, of course...Saturday afternoon I went out shopping a bit...I went to one mall here, the most upscale there is in my city....and on my way home, at about 3 pm, I decided to check the messages on my cell phone....well one was from Sam.  He'd left a message saying that he would be in town (he grew up here) over the weekend!  So I was like, well look at that!!  I just might have something to do tonight, after all!!  So I called him back (he'd called Thursday, must have been when my phone was turned off or something!)  So it was like 4 when I called, and left him a message...he called back at about 5, and we made arrangements to meet up that evening around nine.  So, I went to meet him....I was expecting absolutely NOTHING!  Since he was so much older, and going bald, and didn't live here...I just thought we'd sit and talk and have a couple of drinks...I thought I'd be home by 2 at the latest!!  Well, I was soo wrong!  It turned out that he'd been working at the Saks Fifth Ave. inside the mall that I'd gone to that day...and like the only store I didn't go into was Saks!  Is that weird?  ...anyway.....he is a master at flattery (which I am the ultimate sucker for!) and he just went on and on about me:  my pictures don't do me justice, I should model, my eyelashes are great, my hair perfect, etc etc....he asked me if I wore braces, and when I said no he goes, OHG!  Have my children now!  hahaha, it was hilarious!  ....so we went to one other bar that he used to hang out at, and wanted to visit, so we were there, and we talked about dreams and stuff.  When I told him about my son (usually I make sure people know before I go out w/ them, but I had totally forgotten that he didn't know)...he said he was jealous...he's 45 and never been married, no kids.  Well, towards the end of the night I was liking him a lot, and while we were sitting at the bar talking, I was just sitting there watching his lips, wishing he'd kiss me.  So eventually, we moved to a booth (a red booth) and I scooted under his arm.  He had me feeling really sexy with all his compliments, so I scooted close to him, and before I even thought about what I was doing, I started kissing him.....and  WOW!   It was like, fireworks were going off in the sky!  He is the MOST deliciously sexy kisser I have ever kissed!!  And mind you, almost every single person I've ever kissed has told me I'm a great kisser....and this guy, oh my goodness!  It was soooo great.  We were still kissing when the bar lights came on at closing time.  He said, 'wow, my ex never kissed me like that in five months!"....anyway...after the lights came on, I was so disappointed, and said I wasn't ready to go home yet.  So he said, well come with me.  I was hesitant at first, but the alcohol and sensual kissing had me very turned on, and wanting more.  So, we got in his car and drove to his house....it turns out that he was visiting his father, who still lived in the house that Sam grew up in!!....so I had to sneak in, and we went to the room that had been his while he was growing up....ha!  We ended up fucking that night, and it was one of the funnest night I've ever had!  I had on knee high, black high-heeled boots, as it was winter, and I kept those on while we had sex...Sam's cock is really long, although not very thick....but wow, is it wonderful!  We started out on the couch...he licked my wet pussy until I was about to go crazy.  Then, we went to the bedroom, laid on the bed (me w/ my boots still on!!)  Sam laughed at me, and said, you're going to keep those on?  Haha!  We had wonderful sex--Sam talks a lot , he says yeah, and oh I love how you ride my cock, oh you ride it so good....yeeeeeah, yyyyeah!  I loved it, he talks just right!   Oh yeah, he says, 'fuck me' a lot too.  God, just thinking about it turns me on!  So we went two rounds before falling asleep wrapped in each other's arms....see, the weird thing about Sam is, I just get such a warm, cozy feeling with him!  I mean, it's really strong....when I lay next to him, I just feel like I can't get close enough to him!  I snuggle in and snuggle in, and it always seems like maybe I can get just a little bit closer!  And it was even like that on the first night.  (with Ray, it's not like that at all!)  I've really only had that feeling w/ two other guys that have been in my life, that I can remember...and they are guys that I ended up falling in love with.  OH yeah--I don't usually kiss them first, either...I've only kissed first the same two guys, the ones that I fell in love with.  I just don't usually get the urge first, usually it's them who move in to kiss first.  So I woke up at about five a.m. (boots still on!), and I was sweating up a storm...so I took the boots off, and my moving around woke him up....so we went another round.  Morning sex is my favorite....it wakes you up, gets your blood flowing....it was just as awesome in the morning, and I was very impressed that he was able to go three times in one night, at 44 (he was 44 at the time).  His hard ons are really hard, too....man, it's been way too long since I've seen him (I last saw him in....I have to think for a minute.....April, maybe?..or May?)!!  Sex with him is just pretty much perfect....everything is there!      .....it was strange, though, when I woke up....I was looking at him, and noticed that some of the hairs on his chest are gray....and just realized that he's the oldest person I've ever been with...there's almost as much difference in age between he and I as there is between my son and I!!   Welp that is it for today...more tomorrow!
