      Jesus, this is insane. So today was pretty average... did a bit of work... conversed with some friends over MSN in the afternoon... Managed to move my cigarette box around 5mm with MY MIND!!!!  Now, this has been a recurring dream of mine for many years. Around 4 I would say. I was sitting in my office, staring at my box of smokes which was on a piece of paper with markings on it... I felt my stomach start to push, at first I was a bit worried as to what was going on, but I kept staring at the box of smokes. Slowly, it moved... forward... just enough to cover one of those lines on the piece of paper it was resting on!! Man I was blown away!! I actually saw it move! I almost have trouble accepting the fact that this happened... I mean, I've dreamt about doing stuff like this for ages, and for it to happen in real life is almost unreal! I knew I had it in me... but with all thats happened the last few days, I really didn't expect anything as monumental as this to happen. Needless to say... I sort of know what happened today... so now its up to me to practice and try and hone the skills properly! Man, I am excited!  Funny enough, this was not meant to be an average day it seems. For not only did the above happen in the afternoon, but the evening was just as entertaining and interesting!  So its my friends girlfriends birthday. And just before the party was due to commence, I got a call from a client to help out with a backup... so off I troddle to sort this guy out. Now, when I returned, there were a number of interesting, colorful characters walking about. Then I saw her... mmmmm, mmmmm... I was like, damn man, thats very, very nice! And so proceeded to make small chit chat and the like. Strange thing is that she is the sister of my friends girlfriend... talk about keeping it close to home right? Heh heh :-) Anyway, moving swiftly along. So we talking and carrying on... and at some point everyone leaves the party... Around 11 or so I suspect (this is a weeknight afterall!). So there is my friend and his girlfriend, her sister and me.   I would request that you use your overactive imagination to imagine what happened next.  I start to pull into her and start feeling her up... Oh man, what a gorgeous little petite body she has! So we grope for an hour or so while my buddy is still chilling with his chick in the lounge... as soon as they disappeared into the bedroom, 5 minutes later... thats where we were (NO not in my friends bedroom, mine!).   Its pretty cold here at the moment, so naturally, clothes had to come off to take proper advantage of the body heat thing. Again, not gonna go into too much detail... but oh boy, was it nice :-)  You see, I don't know what the f*** is going on at the moment, but I ain't complaining. The last couple of weeks have been almost unbelievable.   Today which started out so subtly, so normal so to speak. It ended up being an incredible day in my life... I mean, I managed to move something with my mind... met a girl tonight and got her sleeping in my bed right now. I can't sleep in case you wondering why I'm posting to my blog right now. But yes, what a day!!  Its days like these I thank the gods for being alive! Its days like these I believe in the overwhelming power of my mind! The overwhelming power to bring into my life, that which I want, need :-)  Till later!

      I think we have come to far in the wrong direction... I mean, the way forward looks so bleak, so without promise of anything better. Now I'm not talking about my life, I mean us as a society, as a race, as human beings! We need to get back to basics, back to the simple things in life. We are all so lost in making a living that none of us are actually living life. That sounds pretty cliche I know, but ain't it the truth? There are so many cliches which could describe the current state of the world... and one actually starts wondering why they are cliches? Has it become so obvious to us all that we now just ignore it becuase we've heard it all before? I hope not!  So I've heard in certain circles that the end of the world is coming pretty soon... about 8 years from now - 2012. Around the corner... and the best part of this cataclysmic event in the not too distant future is the fact that it will be the worst cleansing yet. Earthquakes, tornados, floods, etc, etc. Which means that only a handful of people will survive! Thank the gods for that!! I love being alive, I love living in this beautiful world... but there is just too much wrong with it to be ignored anymore.  I find peace and solice in the fact the world as we know it is going to end in 2012. It means we can live each day to its fullest and not worry about the consequences. K, so I know there's this movie "The Day after tomorrow" which kinda has all this in it. But being an american flick, they fall horribly short of describing the events which will come to pass. But hey, just so you know, this little post has nothing to do with the movie.   You see, as a society we have no common goal, its just each man / woman for him / herself! Which really bites, cause what are we working towards in the end then? Hmmm? We are headed down the path of destruction at the speed of light... and the darkness is coming up fast. (Thank you!!).  There is no sense of the greater good, only a greater greed, which seems to become worse and worse everyday!   Anyway, I think I'm rambling now, but I think we as a race need to be wiped off this planet... hopefully have a handful survive, to start again... and lets all hope they have the sense not to come down this road again...

      Hardly seems possible to be as happy as I am at the moment!! I mean, today was just insanely wonderful! I finally went and spoke to a woman whom I had left in my past due to foreseen circumstances :-P It was so nice to see her again and we chatted for quite a while!  Now by some fluke occurrence of what I can only perceive to be fate intervening on an otherwise uneventful day, we decided to go to movies together! She owns a shop... She was working today... She normally hates going to movies... And for her to close her shop? Needless to say I was more than slightly surprised at her eagerness to join me on my midday escape to the cinema! So off we troddle to the theatre, where we happily watched Shrek 2 with about 150 kids! Thankfully, they were so engrossed in the intense story of Shrek, that they proved to be less of a distraction than I originally anticipated.  After movies we mission off to her place, where we sat for another 2 hours talking... and talking... and talking! Heh heh :-) I must say it was a very enjoyable experience to have today. I wasn't expecting it to happen... I'm not even sure why or how I ended up in her neck of the woods today. Its days like these that make me believe in fate / destiny or some higher power guiding my life in the right direction. After all, with the last few weeks I've had, the last place I expected to find myself was back there... Especially after the dodge break up we endured (we ended the friendship about 2 months back on a real sour note - again!!). Yes, we had ended the friendship before that as well... say about 4 months before this one... We always seem to find each other afterwards though, which is really strange!  Anyway, back to my original point I was attempting to make in the previous paragraph before I got so carried away in the minor details of the situation... It seemed as though my perky, light hearted and happy demeanor today really cheered her up, made her day in a way I'm sure. And she made mine :-)  I'll be sure to have a drink to Destiny / Fate or whomever / whatever is pulling the strings very, very soon.

      So once again, Saturday night... at the local pub... in walks a drop dead gorgeous blonde!! Now, me, I like the brunettes... but when all these blondes look as gorgeous as they do, I really don't mind blondes :-)  So anyway... Moving swiftly along to the not to subtle point of the story.  I'm sitting there, minding my own business... The friend I was with knew her and I asked him to introduce us... He shook his finger at me and said "NO"!  Now, this was not the reaction I was expecting... So I leave it and reckon I'll go over later and introduce myself :-P  10 minutes later, this lovely creature walks over to my bud... and asks him to introduce us... His wife was sitting in front of him, she turned and talked to the blonde as well... and the comment I heard made me weak to my knees! My friends wife said : "If I was 10 years younger, I would also be trying to get into his pants!".Oh my god!   Now don't get me wrong, I love this new found popularity among the female sex. I just hope that whatever I'm doing, I keep doing!!  So now my friend introduces us after she forces him a bit :-P So I get her name, she gets mine, and the first words out of her mouth are: "So you going to go out with me tomorrow night?". "For sure and without a doubt, where we going?" I respond with a smile... "Don't know, meet here, and go from there...".  Now by any standards... that ain't a conversation, thats a please read between the lines because I just want your body!! Like I said before... whatever I'm doing... please let me carry on doing it!!  Anyway, so now I reckon I'm in, and I buy her a couple of drinks...  Alas, I had to much to drink, and as such... buggered off before finalizing a time and place to meet her... and without getting her number... But is ok... the weekend is coming again soon!  BRING ON THE WEEKEND!!! and the blondes ;-)

      So I was having a few drinks at the local pub when in walks this incredible blonde bombshell!! I reckon she had the whole slow motion thing going as well... Mmmmm, mmmm, too fine she looked ;-)  So anyway, I go over and start chatting to her... Her friend, who turned out to be her cousin wasn't too bad a looker either. Anyway, I chat away with these two lovely ladies until the wee hours of the morning... Now they get tired of this little pub and reckon they heading to a club down the road and I should follow them. So, naturally, without hesitation, I do :-)  5 in the morning they reckon they going back to their place for some coffee and chow, and that once again - I should follow them. Lets take a wild guess what I did? Yeah, damn straight... Me, I followed them.   So we get to their place... coffee, toasted sandwiches at 6 in the morning... goes down very, very well I'll tell you what! Especially after a night of drinking!   Alas, we was all very tired... so to bed with us! YES PLEASE!! Now the lovely blonde bombshell whom shall remain nameless, and whom I was totally into, was also thus inclined towards me... as such, one thing... lead to another. While her cousin was sleeping in the bedroom.  Eventually asleep around 9 in the morning :-P  Now all this was really impressive to me, as I'm not used to doing this type of thing. I left their place around 4 or 5 on Saturday afternoon. Saturday evening, I get a call from these two lovely young ladies requesting my presence at their house once more. Naturally, and again, without hesitation... I eagerly accept the invatation and make my way over.  Saturday night was one of those too good to be true nights. I was there with the chicks I was talking to the night before... and the gorgeous blonde was holding my hand... and I had my arms around her... and I kissed her in full view of all the guys in the pub... needless to say, many jealous stares were thrown my way! Which is great!! Cause I'm normally the one throwing the jealous stares!! Heh heh :-)  So a few guys from the pub follow us to their place that night. Nothing happened, we were all so trashed we all passed out relatively quickly!  By 9 on Sunday morning, I was the only sucker left at their place... Lucky me!!  So I'm arbing around the house... when they call me from the bathroom!! They both in the bath... inviting me to join them... How could I refuse such an offer? Yup, I couldn't :-P  So the next thing I'm in the bathtub with two gorgeous females!! Only problem was, with all the drinking that had happened the night before, everything below the waistline was less than responsive!! OH MAN!! HOW?? WHY?? I was distraught!! But I survived! The slight movement of the water also made me slightly nauseas... but hey... like they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger!!  I didn't hear the end of it for the rest of the day! They mocked me from the time they got out of the bath till much later that evening!!  Anyway, the details of the day are quite irrelevant! It is the details of the Sunday night which make this story worth telling :-)     Ok, so there we are... lying in front of the tv... heater going... one woman in each arm...   I get bored with the movie and I start pulling into blondie... feeling, touching... Mmmm, mmmm, tasty and delicous!! Anyway, while I'm enjoying the immense joys which can only be found on a female body... the older cousin reckons she wants some too... and her hands begin to wander over my body...   OH MAN!! My mind was racing! Was this really happening? Heh heh, man, did it ever happen!! Over and over and over again! I won't go into too much detail here... but I think I should mention it was my first threesome, and man was it incredible!! WOW!! There wasn't any lesbo action in there, naturally one would summise with them being cousins and all, but worth the mention... I had my hands full, my mouthful and everything else full with these two! MAN!! What an experience!! Worth repeating I think ;-) 5 hours later, many orgasms and ejaculations later... all satisfied, all tired, all sleeping :-D

      So now I've entered into what seems to be a rather enjoyable relationship with my shag from the other night. We saw each other two nights ago, and once again had a fantastic evening. This time, I spent the night at her place. Heh heh :-) and also, for a change, she showed me! Man, did I get a workout! She smoked a spliff before we jumped into bed, and prior to that, she had warned me that she gets FUCKING horny when she smokes. So I thought, sweet, bonus for me! Little did I know how horny she gets! Man oh man, she really made me sweat!  So anyway, after mind blowing, life altering sex... we fall asleep. I wake up at about 3 in the morning to quite a surprise :-P Her kid (18 months old), is lodged firmly in between my chest and arm with his hand on my face. The last thing you expect at 3 in the morning after having unbelievable sex is to have a little baby lying on you!!  So at the end of the day, I'm quite happy with this chicken... Very nice, down to earth, and rather impressed with me and my performance in the bedroom ;-) All the better for me!! Heh heh :-)   Oh, I nearly forgot, yesterday, I'm relaxing in my bed, sort of trying to catch a bit of shuteye around 3 in the afternoon :-P And I get a call from a lovely lady I know in Durban. Now to hear her voice on the other side of the phone was surprising to say the least, cause we never had anything going between us. I think she wants something to happen between us, but alas, once again, she has a child and is also going through a divorce at the moment, although, she might be over it by now, but I don't know. Anyway, back to the point, she actually called to see how I was doing... Which again, is surprising... Long story short, it might be something to look at. Although, I need to decide whether I want to jeopardise what I have with the current chicken to go after and shag this other one... It is highly unlikely that one will ever meet the other on a random occasion, but you know how these things get. By some fluke or undeniable twist of fate, they will see each other, or find out about each other somehow. Two shags is enough for now. I can't bring myself to break off my other shag at the moment. We been through alot together and I really enjoy fucking her brains out. And I think it would break her heart to let me go. Oh well, it will have to happen sometime. But not just yet ;-)  Heh heh :-) Memory is a funny thing ey? Context man, CONTEXT!! So I went to an interview today... Normally when you go for interviews you get butterflies and what not. I didn't get them today, there was a severe lack of insects in my tummy. So I meet with the manager of this place and listen to what he has to say... I tell him what I can do and what I expect, and how much MONEY I want out of it... He then proceeds to walk me around the company, introducing me to everyone explaining that I'm thinking about joining the company. Now how weird is that? I mean, I just been in an interview for like 30 minutes and now I'm being introduced to everyone? Ok, whatever... So once its all over, he reckons I must go home and think about whether or not I want to join the company. I'm already quite keen, cause now my savings account looks like the grand canyon :-( So tomorrow I phone, say I am keen, meet with the Managing Director, and discuss my renumeration package... and viola, I have a job. Funny how some people battle for jobs and this one fell right into my lap! Heh heh :-) Some people are just lucky I guess, but then again, I think luck left a week or two ago, I reckon its all skill baby, yeah!

      So I'm sitting here, its just before 12 on a Sunday night. Feeling kinda sorry for myself. I can't imagine why though. Sometimes it seems like these things come out of nowhere. Other times you can see them coming...   I reckon the only reason I'm feeling so sorry for myself at the moment is because of the past three weeks... I reckon I hit the crest of a mighty wave... the only problem with that is that you have to come down with it at some point :-P And when you come down with it, you come down hard :-( Oh well, howzit reality, how you doing? Heh heh :-) Reality is a bitch ain't it? I mean seriously...   So I know I can get with any woman I set my sights on (not bragging here, merely stating what I percieve to be the truth). So I spose, now I'm looking for something special... something to keep me up nights, all night ;-)  The funniest thing about all this is, normally, what keeps me in a relationship is the thought of sleeping with the woman. Since all of these woman give themselves up so easily, there's nothing to really look forward to is there? In the beginning stages of a relationship, before you get together and get down and dirty in the bedroom... You know quite a bit about the person, you know them... You sleep with them to deepen the connection, and then it doesn't matter whether they were good or bad in bed, you wanna see them again because you like them as a person (god that sounds gay :-|).   Now be honest, if you sleep with a woman on the first date, as a man, do you really think there is any need to see them again? (unless they were really fantastic in bed...). You don't really want to get to know them better, cause you know on the basic animal level what they about. What they look like, naked!! And so on and so forth.  I guess what I'm trying to say here is that its a fucking fantastic experience to have a few one night stands. But the loss of connection, the loss of companionship which normally comes with being with a woman leaves you feeling somewhat empty, somewhat shallow, nothing. Which would explain the feelings I'm going through at the moment.   Oh well, not a bad thing mind you. I've had myself a blast. I think now is the time to call the chicks I've encountered in the previous weeks and see if I can hook up with one of them for a while. Have a bit of fun on and off with them. Will have to see. I'll give the one from the party the other night a call tomorrow and see if she's keen on seeing me again.

      So like after a pretty rough month of working on this guys system. He has turned out to be a real asset in the end. He has this friend who manages the IT side of a local company here. These guys fly Delphi Developers down from Joburg to Durban everytime they need something done. Now, from the sounds of things... I may be able to get my foot in the door here and get put onto a development contract with them. I'm meeting them on monday to see what they do and if I can do it. I'm pretty confident that I can do whatever they need me to do, which is great. Extra drinking and smoke money ;-) Plus I saw an old friend of mine from my ex-company... who's currently doing contract work up in Joburg... He reckons he'll send me the numbers I need to get setup, and I'll be well sorted! This is all sounding too good to be true, but I know only one or two of them will pan out. I ain't worried about that though... I've told myself that I will never work for anyone else ever again. I must make it on my own... no matter how tough it gets. I reckon I can do it, I believe in myself enough to do something with my life. I was not born for mediocrity, or so I keep telling myself :-P Anyway, long story short, things looking up on the business front now too!! Heh heh :-) I didn't call any of my personal interests today, I slept the whole day away... I pretty much did what I felt like doing today. Which is a great feeling. Tomorrow is Sunday, will be going to see the Spiderman 2 premiere at Gateway. Maybe I should call one of my shags for a celebratory shag afterwards? Hmmmm, yeah, I think thats a good idea ;-)

      Yeah, so I bugger off to my local watering hole... to see the drop dead gorgeous blonde I was so keen on last week. And lo and behold I run into her there... but she was so uninterested in me, I reckoned, fuck you bitch.   Hey you know what they say though... if you haven't got anything nice to say... get yourself a publisher ;-)  So for the rest of the night I park off and enjoy having a number of frosties.  Still perving over her whenever she was in sight, but otherwise not making too much of a fuss over it. I thought she was drop dead gorgeous last weekend... She still is, but she's a bit of a bitch, and I'm not the only one who thinks this. A number of guys at the pub know about her and reckon the thought of her is ten times better than the reality. After tonight, I'm inclined to agree.  You know what? How can I be such a judgemental prick? I mean I barely know this chick. I don't know her actually. So for me to be so overly judgemental of her is rather idiotic. I mean, seriously... I spose I'll forgive myself for this one outburst at some stage... I have had a few frosties after all :-P  The best thing about tonight is I realized that my friends over here have numbers for my shag two nights ago and the blonde I'm interested in. So, perhaps, tomorrow, depending on how I feel, I may utilize this and actually phone the blondie and see if she would have lunch with me or something :-P  Other than that, I ain't gonna make to much effort to get into her pants... Don't think its worth it. Although, she is fucking gorgeous!! And having a single night with her would be well worth it I reckon. I don't need a relationship with the chick, just a good shag!  So, tomorrow I phone the lovely little shag I had the other night to see if she's keen for another showing... and the incredible drop dead gorgeous blonde...  One can only hope that something happens with one of them :-P Otherwise, I might have to go hunting for talent again... which is not a bad thing... but I'm running out of money to buy drinks, which really sux ass! Anyway, besides the point.  Had a few beers tonight, so this post may seem a bit arb, but hey, I love writing to this thing, even when I'm slightly inebriated ;-)  Till later. Me.

      I've been posting a lot to this site lately... Almost daily now... It's become somewhat of an addiction. Its like a personal but public diary! I love it.  Writing about personal experiences and life in general is a therapeutic exercise I think, helps you digest and think about the happenings of the day, especially when its memorable ;-) Even when its not, its still nice to write about it...  !!!BLOGSPOT RULES!!!

       Current Mood:   F***ing irratated   Music:   Dire Straits - Calling Elvis   Eyes are burning from lack of sleep... Slept from about 1 this afternoon till now... around 6. Feeling better than earlier today, I was ready to pass out on the side of the road at one point. Anyway, besides the point ain't it?  So I dropped my shag off this morning, man, she looks cuter this morning than she did last night! Naturally, there seemed to be a number of inexplicable love bites on her soft sexy neck! Rowr!!   Oh, she is a mom, she has a 18 month old baba... She is still married, but in the process of getting a divorce ;-) Her and her husband have been seperated for the past 2 and a half months.   God damn arseholes like that make me sick! He used to beat her!!! I mean, seriously... if you had to see this woman, with such a sunny disposition... beautiful smile... and a myriad of other attributes which make it quite impossible to have any thoughts of raising a hand to her beautiful face in anger, you would know what I'm saying. And thats not the only abuse she suffered at the hands of this bloody prick... Emotional abuse also played a large role in her being stuck in the relationship for so long.  I think there should be a special place in hell reserved for woman beaters and rapists. They don't deserve anything as nice as an eternal pit of fire, soul burning for an eternity... agonizing, excruciating pain. Nothing that nice should await guys like that. I wish I could dream of a more sadistic and cruel way to punish them for an eternity... I leave that to the universe though...  Bastards!
