						   I will take a cue from Tom, (or tOm. I don't know whether it is best to spell his name, with the capital O because that is how it is spelled, or spell it in the traditional form because the other way would be infringing on his personal signature. This is something to think about.) and tell about my day.  My day was surprisingly short. Just when it should have been morning, it was noon, and then right when my quiet evening was at a beginning, night fell. Then I socalized. I had three voices too, but mine were the guys I sat with, and I didn't listen to any of them. I was too busy choking on clouds of black smoke, which I fanned with a menu, until the fellow next to me got scolded by the other fellow next to me, and everybody switched hands and blew towards the fellow across from me, who choked less and didn't seem to mind.  I came home to my comfortable green walls and my computerized nest, where I punched buttons, turned dials, and pacified myself with the safe green glow of tiny little electronic dots on these things and those, informing me that all was well.   "Everything is in working order."  When it comes to little green dots, no news is bad news. It is the worst of news. I wish there was a little green dot on me, so that I could tell when I was doing all right. I used to wear a mood ring, but it was broken. Besides, mood rings only tell you things you already know.

						   I have two feet and two socks and two shoes. they are different yet the same. mirrors I suppose. but tonight I will use them symbolicly because I have options for my evening. I don't know whether to listen to my shirt, my hat or my pants. OK, screw the shoe symbols because I have three options, and they fit my clothes better than my feet. I am at work right now and I know that either option must start from home since my face is oily and my hands are blue from using dry-erase markers.  My day started out 1 hour late for work today, but other than that I worked hard and got a lot of things done. However I feel my accomplishements while bringing me closer to the workaday world is a bit unfullfilling. Always more crap to do I suppose.  I am inclined to find a cliff and hurl into the immediate void beginning a spinning freefall again. I think I know what lies at the bottom. It is either death, life or love.  I don't know whether to listen to my hat, shirt, or pants. I think I shall leave my shoes on the edge of the cliff.

						   [ Tue Apr 06, 01:17:20 PM | Mulya Pinkerton | edit ] Hello and welcome to Bee House. Some bee houses are made of bamboo, some are made of bees. This one of made of words, but once we are quite bored with it, I am going to give it to some bees and they are going to make honey out of it   I hope that seven people will post entries regularly. Less doesn't seem like enough, and more is too many to keep track of. It is for me, anyway, and I asked the bees and they felt the same way. We can't forget them as we move along here. Remember this is a gift for them because they are building an extra room on the side of my house. It's a very small room that only bees can fit in, but it's the thought that counts.   Later we will all exchange anecdotes. If you don't have any, make some up, but if you can't make any up, tell us some real ones. If you can't do either, then just tell a little story about something that happened once. We'll see where this takes us.

						   Look everyone! Bee House has a new look! Of course you will not notice, because you never come here, you bad people you. There rae three of us too, while there should be seven. That's okay... I'll get four more people soon, and we'll reform this blog.   It's not even my turn yet, but I might have to start making more entries on my own. I would be ashamed to present such a skimpy blog to our bee friends!

      The story of the day was going to be about a creature that did not die. There would be two of them. They would be different from each other, and yet the same. For instance, perhaps both of them would be round and feathery like ostriches, but one of them would be pink, and one of them would be blue, or perhaps they would both be spotted like jaguars, but one of them would have a low voice, and the other one would speak in tongues.   They would both live in a tree house with some kind of tree person, like a tree gnome, or a bird lady. She would have one. Maybe she would have the pink one with the low voice, and then one day along would come the blue one that spoke in tongues.   Then she would have the two of them, and people would start to say, "You greedy thing! How did you get two of those creatures!" so instead of trying to give one away, she would try to kill one; maybe the pink one.  She would throw rocks at it, and push it out of the tree, and tie a rope around its neck, but it just wouldn't die, and furthermore, it just wouldn't go away, because it had always lived in that tree. Then she would realize that she just couldn't kill it, and she would start to feel guilty, and just let it live there with her in that tree, but then some instigator would come along and say the same thing that the other people were saying before, and that's when she would go after the blue one that spoke in tongues.   Then this blue creature, it would be weak, you see, and it would die right away. Say, she'd yell at it or something, something like "I hate you," or "This is my tree, and you don't belong here" and that blue creature would just drop dead, right there on the spot. Then, that tree person, she would feel so guilty because she had killed the blue creature, and she would try to bring it back to life or something, but it wouldn't work, and she would swear never to kill any blue creatures ever again.  Well, then people would laugh at her, see, and say, "You'll never have a blue creature living in that tree with you again." but the next morning, there a new one would be, sitting in that tree, being all lovey and singing to her, and she would just be listening, and everyone would be watching, and they wouldn't understand how that happened, but she'd just be glad the good Lord had given her another chance, and that would be it.  I was going to write a story like that today, but I hadn't quite gotten it figured out. I don't quite think she should get the blue creature or the pink creature in the end, but they all seem to belong in that tree.

      "What is the truth?" she asked.  "Suppose I don't know," said he.  "Maybe you should." she answered.  "Perhaps we all should." said he.  "You the most." she declared.  "Why do you suppose?" said he.  She thought.   "Because you are Jesus." she replied.  "So I am." said he.

      A story about things I have never written before:  "I really don't like vegetarians," said Miki to her friends for no particular reason. They take away all of the fun. If I were an animal, I would rather be cooked than live on a farm all of my life."  "City girls!" smirked Rody. He was a dashing fellow who came from nowhere at all. Everyone loved him and thought he was just the bees knees, only they wished he wouldn't carry a hatchet in his back pocket. It seemed rude somehow.   He was sitting next to Rhondina, who had the power to turn into an acorn. All she had to do was say the words "Huzza kuzza, I am an acorn." and she would be an acorn. It came in handy many times, only the night before she discovered that her transformations also occurred when other people made this statement. She and Sir Hobbington had been making passionate fun beneath a coconut tree at the time.   Later that day, SueAnne hit Henry in the head with a pineapple and  everyone laughed afterwards. Fifteen minutes later, poor Henry had an attack that drove him completely mad.   The six of them all went out for lattes at the local cafe, and he ordered a coney. The others asked the waitress to humor him, but they didn't serve coneys, and so neither did she. At last he came to his senses, as everyone agreed he should.  Then, Paper Jones made a fatal mistake. He fell into the fish tank. Most everyone had the feeling that he did it on purpose, although they didn't know why.  Later that day, Miki started complaining about vegetarians again, Rody smacked Mad Henry in the head with a pineapple, and Rhondina turned into an acorn.   Happily, SueAnne had a plate full of livercheese and onions. Almost everyone felt that the entire situation was absurd, and resolved never to do it again.  The end

      A composition/compression of things I have said in this blog so far (The expurgated version):  From the weathering of days and the trecheries of men their oversized mouths gape in disbelief.  "My, look at you!" said the toad, "I suppose I will have to step around to the other side of this picture." At the other is its end. If all the people on earth should forget, I wouldn't be upset in the least.

      I was able to finish telling my story tonight. I included the part that I had already written, but I will have that in italics and the remaining portion in regular font.  Begin:   I once knew a clock who came to life, and grew arms and legs.   Everyone said, "How fortunate for that clock to come to life, where most of us who are inanimate must remain so throughout our existence!"  Fortunate, indeed, but for whom? This clock turned out to be an evil clock, and all of the time that it had ticked and ticked and did nothing else but spin its slender hands and show the time, it had been dreaming the wickedest of dreams. When at last it realized the possibility that clocks could grow limbs and learn to speak and function like ordinary people, it made haste to retrieve all of the time it had spent idly, and cause wreckage among the souls of good people.  It was then that I met this clock. Sir Telling Time, he called himself, for all of a clocks intelligence goes into mathematical skills, and very little is left to the order of creativity.   I said to him, "Pardon me if I sound rude, but what do you suppose is the purpose of your new found ability? After all, you must admit it strange, as I do. Don't you ever wonder how this came to be?"  "I believed," said Sir Telling Time, "I believed in me, and I believed in the believing of people, as well as the believing of all throughout Time."  How fair, thought I, the words of Sir Telling Time. They were both cryptic and sincere. He informed me that he had many plans, unlike most clocks who live to serve mankind, and are content if they are simply not dropped, beaten, or replaced.   "Power," he explained, "is not like eggs that fall from a nest. Power is the snake squirming in the nest who got too full and through out the extra egg." At this remark, I began to think that this clock was psychotic.  No longer was the question of why or how important to me, but now I asked myself, "Where shall I go, that I can say good riddance to this evil?"   My perception was, apparently, correct. No sooner had I turned away from him than he began to attack me with his sharp, sword-like hands. Covering my head with my hands, I started to run as swiftly as possible. Somehow, although it does not seem quite logical, I was able to outrun him.  I cannot say why it was so, but his desire to inflict pain was so pure and straightforward, it seemed that it lacked any motive whatsoever. It thrived on fear, this thing without a mind or a heart or a soul that sprang forth from the creations of man and ravaged his very being, devouring his children, and leading havoc to his door. When men and women tried to destroy him, he swatted at them with his hands, which were razor sharp.   Fortunate indeed! Needless to say, the people renounced this thought, and gathered many strategies to defeat him.  To illustrate the exact kind of diablerie that Sir Telling Time's miraculous animation set loose, I should like to recount a terror that I witnessed -- a sheer demonstration of calculated recklessness:  A family with a mother and father, three young children, and a grandmother lived in a house together, and not one of them possessed any proper mean of defense against a manlike clock. He burst into their home without warning, and came upon the kitchen, where he spied a mouse scurrying across the kitchen floor. At once, He lifted the mouse by its tail, flung the hapless creature into the air, and sliced it right in half, from the tip of its nose to the end of its tail, with his horrible and hideous minute hand. The children cowered in the pantry, trembling with fright. Sir Telling Time emitted a most wretched laugh, making no secrets of his hateful intentions.   "Why oh why? Oh Why," he sang, "would a great big monster like me bother with a diminutive little nincompoop, like little Nancy, who I just cut in two? The world shall know me. Men, women, and children shall know me. The very dust-mites that live in your dust shall know my name! No creature is too great or two small: The powerful Sir Telling Time spreads evenly the pleasures of his wicked deeds!"  The powerful Sir Telling Time began to dance, and he began to hum, and to be all the more cruel to the horrified family, he walked straight out the door, and teased, "Don't wait up! I may not return until the mood strikes again!" On that note, he decided to strike twelve, although it was several minutes past one.  I would not want anyone to think for an instant that the leaders of this fine town did not take any action to stop the formidable Sir Telling Time from having their people shucked and scraped away like kernels of corn. Truth to tell, their were many battles fought, some in which the people seemed to be ahead, but always with casualties. Hope was not completely lost, yet they grew wearier, and the enduring strength of this infamous clock both terrified and amazed them.   Then one day, as suddenly as the horror began, Sir Telling Time ceased completely. He made no motions, and no sound. He did not stir at all, first for a few hours, and then for several days. It took great courage to approach him, but, in order that he could be pronounced legally dead, the coroner overcame the fears of many people. It appeared, he said, that the clockwork man of unmentionable evils had not been wound in quite some time.   Sir Telling Time stands in the center of a park, in the same spot and same position he was in when he stopped. Like the Tree of Knowledge, he stands alone, his limbs spread out over the foliage beneath, and the people dare not touch him for fear of what may begin. Over the years, cobwebs have made their way through and around him in zigzag patterns, and a few young people, who do not remember or care about the days of his hideous reign, have marked on him their initials in spray paint.

      Today I ran into a saber toothed tiger. I asked if it was lost, since I live in the city, and I don't know any kind of tiger to be a city creature, let alone a saber toothed tiger. It told me that it was looking for a flat rock to scratch its nails on. I told it that these days we use metal nail files or emery boards, but it'd better by the metal kind, because I don't know how well cardboard would hold up under his claws. Actually, I don't know if it was a he or a she. I thought it rude to ask.

      Down the street from where I live is a building with an island in front of it, seperating the property of its owners from the street. It was once a perfectly sound little knoll without blemishes, but people who had not the patience to walk around the island rather than cross right through it had worn a path through the center, and the grass could no longer grow there.   In the spirit of the nieghborhood, where bridges are built over broken fences, and accommodations are more often favored over 'no tresspass' signs, a sidewalk was layed over the beaten path, and tidiness was ensured.  However, as I walked from my work to my home the other night, I noticed an interesting development. A new path had been worn through the same patch of grass, not four feet away from the servicable, yet neglected, pavement.  I would like there to be some kind of moral to this seemingly pointless story; something like, no island is free from man (the island being all places on this earth), or perhaps that mankind is often blind to clear paths, but I thought niether of these things as I made my way around the little bite of grassy land.  Rather, the thought I had when I passed it by was this: There are those of us who will be tread upon. There are those of us who will be protect ourselves in every capacity, from the weathering of days, and the treacheries of men, and eventually, we will be tread upon.   Humanity is the childhood of the spirit; the time when we are broken and fixed. Perhaps someday we will look back and all tragedies will be like scraped knees, and the paths beaten over our bodies will be but thin scars on our outermost flesh. I hope. I wonder how many lessons can be had from that short dirt path.

        "My life is so ordinary," said the toad, "All day long I sit on my lily pad, listening to the chirping of crickets, and the splashing of fish."     "What odd things for a toad to do!" he heard a voice say. It was the voice of a frog from beyond the thicket.     "I say," the frog repeated, "Those are awfully strange things for a toad to do. How did you manage to get onto the lily pad, when your feet are not webbed?"    The toad replied, "A creature put me here, and if you care to listen, I will tell you the story."    "Certainly," answered the frog, "It sounds more interesting than the chirping of crickets and the splashing of fish in the water!"    The toad continued, "It was about four days ago, my friend. There were giant creatures playing in the hedge, and there I was hiding beneath a toadstool, just as I should.     "I heard the footsteps of a great monster and said to myself, 'Should I stay here beneath my toadstool and make not a peep, it will not notice me, and I will never learn what befalls a toad who is noticed by a great monster,' but -- horror of horrors! -- The thing found me and scooped me up from my cove!"    "How dreadful!," cried the frog, in shock, "Whatever did you do?"    The toad cleared his throat, in order that he would not have to cough during the climax of his story.    "I tried to get away, but it shoved me with its great long fingers, and I tumbled into the palm of its hand. This happened several times, and I came to the realization that it was playing a game with me!"    The frog peered out at the toad from the plants, crawling towards him with excitement. "And then what?"    The toad thought for a moment, and spoke.      "I decided that the only way to make it stop pushing me around was to make it not want to play the game anymore, and the only way I could make it not want to play the game was to  bore  it -- "    "You mean, like with a stick?" said the frog.    "No! By being boring. Look," the toad straightened himself, and cleared his throat again, "I'll explain: The monster was playing a game, but if he tired of the game, it would stop. I made the game boring for it --  Too boring to play anymore. The way I did this was to stop letting it play. It wanted me to try to crawl out of its hand, so instead I curled up and went to sleep.    "It was just then that I heard it say, 'Oh, this frog is tired. Lets take you home, frog, so that you can have a rest.'"    "But you are not a frog!" said the frog, revealing a tinge of resentment.    "I agree!" replied the toad, sounding equally affronted, "But this creature was either senseless or ignorant, for it  did  solemnly take me as a frog, and I  daren't  speak up, for fear that it would come up with some new game with which to taunt me!    "And I knew this would come to no good end," said the toad, " I can tell you in confidence that I knew this would come to no good end."    "Well, leave it to a toad," said the frog, "What happened next?"    "Then he took me here," answered the toad.     "Here? Here in this pond? But why?" (If you have ever seen a frog in a state of utter astonishment, then you know how their eyes light up, and their oversized mouths gape in disbelief. This is how the frog looked now)   "What good are you in a pond this size?"    "Oh, but  no  good, my dear fellow, "lamented the toad, "No good at all! It's too far a jump to shore, and I am a terrible swimmer. I believe that the monster thought well of itself, sending a frog to it's rightful home, but I am not a frog."    "Emphatically not," said the frog, and he hopped into the water.     The toad thought that he would not see the frog anymore that night, and he heaved a deep sigh of resignation. Just minutes later, however, he heard a bubble pop, and a splash, and then sitting next to him was the frog, in all his green splendor.    "My, look at you!," said the toad, "I thought you would be an ugly fellow, but you're almost as handsome as me!"    "I call that a grave compliment," was the frogs reply, as he made himself comfortable on the soft float, "Never the less, I should like to help you. Hop on my back, friend, and I'll swim you ashore."      "I will!" said the toad, and he leaped up and held onto the frog, who swam him safely to firm ground, just as he had said he would.     The toad thanked him many times, and invited him out for malts and brandy, which the frog cordially accepted.       "I wouldn't miss it for an instant," he declared, and because of this, the toad decided he must really be a winning fellow. To this day, they are very good friends, although they now seem to have some disagreement about how they met.    If you ask the toad, he will say that he saved the frog from the great monster in the hedge. If you ask the frog, he will act as though the toad was drowning when he met him, rather than just waiting for the opportunity to jump to shore. All in all, however, they have agreed to disagree, and don't let it get in the way.

        On a house on the top of a hill was a window that had been broken, and inside of this house were Little, a man whose soul was laden with guilt, Mr. Bighead, a man whose head was large, and who often took the liberty of permitting people to be just the way they were, and Joy, a woman who simply was.    The three of them, as well as many others, had lived in the house for many years. The house had no doors, and the window had never been opened for air. Everyone in the house assumed that this window was a moving picture, and had never before attempted to open it.     Often times, before the window had been broken, people in the house would gaze upon it, and ask each other, "How do you think this picture was made?"     From the window they could view a vast heap of land, several trees, and far below, a house with people that walked in and around it. When the picture became white, the house got colder, and they lit a fire in the fire place. When it turned green, they fanned themselves with paper and consumed enormous quantities of ice.     It was Little who broke the window, and frightened the people, who had always presumed the other side was flat and gray. Little was prone to fits of rage, for he could not live with himself and the guilt he felt for being alive in the world, and breathing up the air of his fellow people.        On a day, when he was feeling particularly vulnerable and inferior, his friend, Joy, said to him, "Hello Little. You look a little drawn out today."    "I'm sorry!," cried Little, and he emitted a shriek, "It isn't my fault I'm alive!"    "You have every right to be sorry for being alive," said Mr. Bighead, "But I will thank you not to scream. Screaming is so elementary."      Joy interjected, "I don't think that's what you mean. I think you mean juvenile, or childish."    "So you do," replied Mr. Bighead, "It is your right to have your own feelings about what I mean to say."   Joy grinned and said, "As long as you're happy."    Little smashed his head into the window.    The next day, the window was still broken, and the picture was letting in lots of wind, which did not seem at all logical to the house tenants. This upset Little all the more, for the people in the house were all very worried, and it was all his fault.    "It isn't my fault!," he screamed, "It isn't at all my fault!" and he flailed his arms about in the air until he had fainted.     "It isn't his fault," said Joy, and kissed him on the nose.     "It is indeed his fault," replied Mr. Bighead, "But he has every right to believe that it is not. I won't try to take that away from him."    The other people in the house demanded that someone look at the other side of the broken picture, and find out why it was blowing air at them.     Mr. Bighead volunteered Little for the job, saying, "This is his fault, which is quite all right, for he is perfectly entitled to be at fault. He can look at the other side of the picture if he feels privlaged."    Little lifted the window, but the picture did not move, and the frame did not detach from the wall.     "I suppose I will have to step around to the other side of this picture. When I do, I will have to become very flat, so that I will be between the picture and the wall. I hope that this can be done. " Everyone agreed that this seemed quite plausible, but they were all very surprised when, instead of becoming flat, he turned up walking around inside of the picture.     The people gasped.    "Did you know," said Little, "That out here there is a house just like the one that we often look at in our picture!? You can't see it, I think, because... You must all be inside it!"    Then Joy and Mr. Bighead stepped out and joined him. Astounded with this new discovery, they invited the rest of the dwellers to step out as well, which a few of them were inclined to do.    Suddenly the house was swarming with reporters and helicopters with many lights and cameras. One of the reporters approached Little, and then jumped at the sight of him, for there was still a shard of glass sticking out of his left temple.      "Do you live in this house?" she asked.    "Yes," said Little, "But it isn't my fault! I have lived in it all of my life!" and he began to wail.    "You'll have to excuse my friend," said the amiable Mr. Bighead, "He is exceptional. He became that way when he was born. We think it may have been something that couldn't be stopped. Anyway, now that he has a piece of glass sticking out of his head, he is bound to be aggravated, but it is his prerogative."    "And who are you?" asked the reporter.    "I am Mr. Bighead," he replied, "They call me so because I am a big man with big body and a big head. My brain is enormous, too."    "Well!" The reporter was so impressed, she could hardly think, "We're all here because no one has ever come in or out of this house before. What will you all do now that you are outside?"    "I imagine we'll go on a journey." said Mr. Bighead.    "Where too?" asked the reporter.     He thought earnestly and then replied, "All around the world, I would guess. We will go all around the world and see what it looks like."    "How long do you think that will take?" asked the reporter.     "Oh, about a day," said Mr. Bighead, "When Little wakes up from his hysteria, Joy will take him by the hand, and we'll all go looking around the world and writing down what we see."    "Oh?" said the reporter, "And then what?"    "And then we will go back home." said Mr. Bighead, "We will have a lot of work to do in the morning. I'll be reminding Joy a lot."    "Of what?" asked the reporter.    "Of everything we saw while we were out. It won't be hard. I'll have written everything down."  "But whatever for?" asked the reporter, "Won't she remember?"  "Oh yes," said Mr. Bighead "But this way we can get it detail for detail. Joy is a mighty good painter, and we need her to paint a picture of the outside."    The reporter stretched the microphone towards Mr. Bighead and asked, "What will you do with such a painting?"    He sighed, as though exasperated by such foolishness.     "We will replace the old one," he said, "The one that Little broke last night. Then we will all be comfortable again."

      A man said to me, "Remember when your mother told you everything was going to be okay? That isn't really true."  There was not much of a pretence to this statement, which was presumptuous and stupid.   I answered, "I don't remember when she said that."

        Opossums (also, possums)    Possums are made completly out of hair. Their bodies are thick tufts of this bristly fur, and there legs, which make no connection to any part of their bodies, are slender pink sticks with plug shaped feet that glide beneath them and simulate a walking movement as they float along the dry  surface of the earth. A possum's long tail is like a snake. At one end is it's head, with it's funny sharp teeth and beady black eyes. At the other end is its end. It weaves through the mass of fur like a needle and thread through a patchwork blanket. I have never touched a possum, but I have seen one peering at me through the fog of night. I have been very close to one, and they do indeed float, I believe, due to their imponderous nature. Besides all of these salient and inarguable facts, the possum is a quiet and mystical creature. I am doubtful that they ever eat or sleep at all.     On it's underside, a possum has built in a pouch, which it uses to carry many more possums just like itsself. All of these possums are exactly the same, so that they can't even tell themselves apart, and if you see one at night, it is essential to be kind to it in the least way possible. That is, do not approach it, but if you must associate with it, be cheerful and flattering. All possums are interconnected, and easily offended. Their memories are perfect. You must nor ruffle the well being of a possum. Leave them undisturbed, and if one takes a liking to you, then simply allow this, and do not be overly social or aggressive.     If you ever think that any of this is not true, then simply go out and watch a possum making its rounds in the night. Chances are, it will take notice if you, and you will be afraid not to believe me.

      Wolves. I learned that wolves are all terrible. Non of them are nice. There is not one that can be trusted among others.   There is not one wolf who thirsts for blood who does not thirst for the blood of all men. There is not a wolf of whom I can say, "He thirsts for blood, but he does not thirst for my blood. I will be safe among people."

      It began on a Sunday. No one could wear it off. There was a thing in the branches.   If you saw it, you would have just called it a thing too. There was nothing to describe it: not a name, or a shape or a form.   Shapes and forms and images are all differet things. Forms are formed. They deifinitly come from something, whether they are implied, or solid. Shapes just are. They are when they are, and they can change and then they are no longer. Images are very special. They can be made several times and still be the same. You might never see one, or you may see one that can be sensed only with sight, and never with any other of the senses.   So there was a thing, and it had no shape or form, but it had an image. It was the kind of image that can be seen, but not optically, and it started on a sunday, and no one could do away with the thing, nor could they use it, nor could they grieve over any of it, for it was simply a matter of what was, and could not be changed.  Often times, things that begin seem as though they always were. We are afraid to extinguish those things.

      I learned a lot of new things today.   I learned that no matter how many times the world turns, it still goes around, and it will go tomorrow like it did today, so that the sun will rise and set just as it always has.  Does the sun rise in the east or the west? Why should I know? If all of the people on this green earth should forget, would the sun stop rising and setting?

      I fixed the clock.  Do you know anything about rats? I was followed by one for days and days. I saw him so often that I began to call him Zinky. He went to work with me, and he went to school with me. He drank with me, and made friends with all of my friends.   I said to him, "I would rather you were not here." but he wanted very much to be with me.   "But you are a rat, and I am a girl," I said. He did not speak. Zinky never spoke.   I met some kind of bird one when i was only a child. I followed it for years and years. I followed it when it ate and when it drank. i climbed trees and waited for it to alight.   It said to me, "You are a girl, and I am a bird. Where will we go that we can be friends together and still be free?"  I said, "Heaven can tell," so it flew away, into the sky.   Now there is Zinky. I said to him, "Stay away from me."  He said, "I will just follow you at your feet, and you will not even notice I am there." but I feel him at my feet all of the time, and smell his rat stench.   I wasn't lying. Even those who never speak actually speak sometimes.

      There is nothing here. There is nothing for me, and nothing for someone else. There is certainly nothing for you. If you thought so, you were wrong. I gave you some money. You said, "This money is green."  You said all kinds of things. You said, "I was listening," and you said, "I had a thorn in my foot." and you also said "I don't kow anything about the color pink."  I know lots about the color pink. I lived in it for years and years. the color pink is crazy 'bout me. It's funny that way.  I understand that you think something very different. A lot of people think things like that. You must meet them. You would all get along.  You and all of those people who think the thing that you think would all love each other. You could play games and drink tea. You could even have a soda pop together, and you could name eachother's noses and build a house and everything. I wouldn't be upset in the least.

If I say something and not nothing, then you'll know what I am saying, and I don't know you, so I don't want to tell you what I am saying.  It is a flavor of cheese with no name.  It is a letter that makes you cry. It was written by an elf.  It makes noises but it has no feet. It floats.  It is a counterfit acronym.

      A major misunderstanding in the modern world is that there are not people walking this land who turn into wolves, but whether it is a conscious transformation, or an uncontrollable one, there are certainly plenty of people alive today who have, or are in the process of, turning into wolves. There are, as a matter of fact, known cases of both willed and forced human transformations into wolves. Often times, people who are predisposed to wolf transformation are inclined to heighten their chances of developing it by acting in a wolfish manner (eg growling at passers-by, becoming extremely territorial to the point of violence, attacking with teeth and fingernails) victims of this growing phenomenon are also known use these same tactics to aggravate the condition.  I would like to point out that while, in nature, wolves are not necessarily violent, they are generally not trustworthy of people, and will growl in warning, or attack if pushed to do so. Regretfully, humans who have become wolves do not have the commodity of isolation from non-wolf humans, yet still feel threatened by their presence. Yet, much like natural born wolves, they can learn to adapt.   One must ask himself: Why do those who have the choice to restrain their wolf attributes in luau of a sound, human life decide instead to feed and harvest these tendencies? The answer lies in the social structure of wolven domains.  More to come: In my next blog, I will be discussing the social advantages of being a wolf in modern American society, as well as the emotional voids that being a wolf can fill.  I will also talk about what signs to look for if you have cause to suspect a wolf epidemic in your workplace or home.

Other:  I think it must be.   Mulya:  I don't think I asked you what you thought, but I'll let that slide. Question one: What am I thinking?   Other:  How should I know?   Mulya:  I do believe I am the one asking the questions here.   Other:  Well, I don't think you should -   Mulya:  Question number two, Is it true that your real name is Grinsweld?   Grinsweld:  Absolutly not!   Mulya:  Right. Question number three: Have you ever been bitten by a shark?   Grinsweld:  No, well, once.   Mulya:  Guilty!   Grinsweld:  What?   Mulya:  Guilty, in the thrid degree! I sentence you to limbo!   Grinsweld:  What? I -    Mulya:  No further questions your honor. I think my work here is done.  The End

       Interview with Mulya  By: Other   Other:  Hello Mulya. I am hear to ask you a few questions about who you are and what you're doing here and the likes. Do you mind?   Mulya:  What?   Other:  What?   Mulya:  Do I mind what?   Other:  If I ask you some questions.   Mulya:  No, I don't mind. I thought I was doing something you didn't like.   Other:  No, you weren't. I just wanted to ask you some questions.   Mulya:  I thought maybe you didn't like it when I tapped my foot, like this: (tap tap tap)   Other:  I don't think you were tapping your foot.   Mulya:  Wasn't I?   Other:  I don't think you were. Do you mind? Let's get started.   Mulya:  No, I don't mind. (Tap tap tap)   Other:  The first question I would like to ask you is: "Where were you born?"   Mulya:  ...   Other:  Where were you born?   Mulya:  Oh, I was born in a hospital. I remember it like it was yesterday, you see because my mom and dad told me all about it, and then I saw it all in my head, and I dreamed about it, so it's just like...   Other:  Like yesterday?   Mulya:  Yes.   Other:  Well, tell me all about it.   Mulya:  I would rather not. It was very traumatic, you see. The doctor hit me on the foot.   Other:  Oh, he did? Or  she  did?   Mulya:   He  did. I remember, because he had grey brown hair and he was balding. Nobody had to tell me that, and there were square lights, and I was very upset. That's when he turned me up-side-down, and hit me on my foot.   Other:  And what did you do?   Mulya:  Well, I started to scream. That's what any baby would do, isn't it? Anyway, that's where I was born... in a hospital, and do you have any other questions?   Other:  I do. Did you write the story about the toad and the frog? I wondered because it gave me terrible nightmares.   Mulya:  I did. It wasn't supposed to scare anyone. It was, after all, a children's' story, and toads and frogs are the most harmless of creatures.   Other: Well, I really don't care for them at all. They make my skin crawl.    Mulya:  Well, maybe you shouldn't read my stories.   Other:  Well, I wouldn't if it weren't my job.   Mulya:  Well, maybe you should get a different job.   Other: Well, maybe I wouldn't have to if you were more inspired.   Mulya:  Well, maybe you'd  get  my stories if you weren't some brainless zombie who could only comprehend whatever the media spoon fed her with the rest of the masses, you jelly fish brained flibbertygibbet.   Other:  That's what you think, you four-eyed, buck-toothed nerd squallard dwelling ice queen.   Mulya:  Hussy!   Other:  harlot!   Mulya:  Trollop!   Other:  Wench!   Mulya:  Wretch!   Other:  Whore!   Mulya:  How dare you affront me in that manner! I smite you with plagues!   Other:  You  say  you smite me with plagues, but you can't  really.    Mulya:  I challenge you to a duel! Choose your weapon!   Other:  I choose my hair!   Mulya:  Vagrant!   Other:  Shazaam!!!   (Mulya is struck down -- The strands of punishment! The wrath of fury!)  Due to unfortunate circumstances, Mulya has been dismembered. I find this very upsetting for reasons I do not care to disclose.  The End

      The lifespan of a taste bud is three days. So is the life span of a fly.  A man once discovered the dark secret of a fly.   It was so simple, when his friends asked how, he answered, "All I did was ask kindly, 'Fly, will you tell me your dark secret?"  "Fly, will you tell me your dark secret..."  The fly answered him with a question, "Oh, how do you know if I have a dark secret?"  "Well, everyone has at least one," whispered the man, to make it easier for the fly to listen to him.   "Well, you are a dirty man," said the fly. "You have dark secrets. That's why you think everyone has them. Not everyone has a secret like mine."  The man was intrigued. Flies love it when they can intrigue people. They are more likely to share their secrets that way. The fly sang a song for the man, and this is how he made it known. It had a whimsical tune that flowed forth and never seemed to pause for thought. It went like this:  "Have you ever have you ever wanted to be have you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall well let me tell you if you've ever wanted let me tell you there's something you should  never know a fly is just--"  The fly paused. His two wings buzzed for a fourth of a second, and he turned his body clockwise.  "This is  my  song," he said.  "I know," whispered the man. His lips curled slightly in amusement, but his brows were furrowed.  "It's a very good song. Why don't you go on?"  "I can't," said the fly, nervously, "I ran out of rhymes."  "It's okay," said the man, and if he could have nudged the fly, he would have, "You sing the song the way you want to, and I'll pretend the words are rhyming. It's a very nice song."  The fly hesitated for a moment, rubbing its front legs together and turning another half-circle. Then, it began to sing again, this time with more concentration:  "Let me tell you, I can tell you one little tiny thing If you want to know a secret grow you a little wing  If you wish that you had been a fly on the wall one day there's a chance that you just might  listen to what I say  Flies are not made for bugging For spreading disease Flying around your picnics Buzzing around your knees  Flies are made for hearing Listen! You should not know this! If you ever wanted to be a fly on the wall..."  "EEW!" A shriek was heard above.  Suddenly the fly was cut short by a woman whose shoe seemed to have been misplaced: Instead of on her foot, it was in her hand. The man, who had been leaned forward, listening intently to the fly's eager little song, was enraged. He jumped up and snatched the shoe from the woman, slapping her hard on the top of her head (for he was taller then her).  This caused many people to stop everything they were doing and turn around to the man. In this situation, there is only one decent thing to do, and he did it: he ran as fast and as far away as he possibly could. When at last he had traveled a considerable distance from them, he doubled over and heaved several deep breaths.   In case you have not managed to understand the secret of flies at this point, I will tell you: One kind of fly carries a human soul, and can appear in the one place and the one time that this should desires most to be in, to hear the one thing, and witness the one event that he feels must be learned by one other person.  The other kind of fly tries to find people who would like to become flies on walls.   The fly in this story was the latter kind of fly, but he failed at convincing the man to become a fly, for the man witnessed the worst kind of fate for a fly -- One that occurs all to often.   Now, I ask you, do you think this is true? Yet, if you were to suppose it were true, it wouldn't matter at all whether it was true or not. It would all be like breathing into the wind.  Anyway, that is my story about the man who learned the secret of all flies. He told his friends, and they did not believe him. This was a foolish of him as it was for the fly to sit in plain view of women with shoes, and surprising too, for a man so skilled at drawing the secrets from mysterious creatures.

One day, the tiny little lady went to her tiny little job at the tiny little store, while everyone else went out to see the tiny little matrix without her. It sucked, and she said to herself, "I hope the tiny little matrix sucks for everyone."   Then, she crawled into a tiny, bitter little hole and died.  The End

      In the end, I guess it doesn't really matter  who  had the biggest trampoline. It was, after all, all a matter of perseption. At the ball, everyone thought that Teeni would have the best time, but in fact it was Marina, and she said that was mostly due to the fact that no one else was alive.  "That would put the rest of the company in rather an ill light." said Teeni of the situation. Presently, she collapsed with the rest of them, and marina swallowed the key.   When it was all over, nobody made a sound, and that was the way they liked it.  The end

      Maybe Dread's Fram should be spelled with a p-h instead of an f. I can't decide how to spell it, because I am not altogether certain of what a fram is. At any rate, I'm sure it doesn't really matter, because, like I said, not many people have heard of it, and I doubt that many people are from there, so I'll likely never meet anyone who would take offense if I spelled it wrong  Today was quite an exciting day, as I had the good fortune to run into killionaire. I thought a killion must be an enormous amount, and he said that there are at least a thousand zeros after a killion, but he could have been mistaken. Really, I think that would be more like a googol.   At any rate, I asked him didn't he mean there are at least a thousand zeros  in  a killion and not after, but he just gave me the old skunk eye, so I left him alone.   I asked my mom if she knew anything about anyone with killions of dollars, and she said that a killion isn't a number at all, and that I should not be talking to people who claim to be killionaires; their just not trustworthy, but I had already talked with him all the same.  The next time I meet him, I'll be that much wiser.

      "How long has it been?"  "Three days, sir!"  Work, and television are plotting to destroy my path of blogging.  Today, very small people went backpacking across my face. They started on my right temple (although I am not sure how they got there to begin with). I believe there must have been three of them: two males, and a token lady. They made a wide route around my nose and stopped to rest on my cheekbone. They took a swim in my eye, and I think they were surprised when it just got too uncomfortable and I started to blink uncontrollably. One of them lost a shoe, which I accidentally swallowed. They went searching for shells on my forehead, but didn't find any. They also tried hunting for wild game in my hair, which they must have presumed to be a forest, but had no luck, to my relief. I thought about flicking them away, but decided to wait it out. This proved to be favorable, as they eventually made their own way out, and I did not have to worry about them coming back. I heard one of them state, "We shouldn't have made that turn back in Dread's Fram." I do not know where Dread's Fram is, nor do I know what kind of a place it is to be traveling. It must be very small, because I don't think anyone larger than an eyelash has ever heard of it. It doesn't sound like a very inviting place to go, at any rate.

      Some times the days seem shorter, even just from one day to the next. I called on my friend Reggie, and asked him if there was a reason why today seemed so particularly short, and he said "Was it leap day?"  "No," I said, "But I don't think that would have made a difference if it was. I tink leap day is just as long as all of the other days."  "Well," he said, "I don't think all of the days are really the same length."  "You're wrong," I said, "It always takes twenty-four hours for the earth to turn around on his axis. It actually takes more than that, but we take that little bit of extra time and make it accumulate into leap day."  "That's where leap day comes from." said Reggie. I couldn't tell if he was telling me or asking me, so I just kicked him.  "That wasn't very nice," Reggie exclaimed with glee. I thought that was really odd, Reggie being so happy when I had just kicked him. Later he informed me that not every time someone exclaims something is it gleeful, but he really couldn't prove that theory.  "After all," I told him, "On teevee, people get excited all the time about winning money and stuff, and none of them are ever angry." Reggie told me that I should watch more soap operas. I don't really like the soaps, however. I tink they're fake and i would much rather watch the game shows.     At any rate, I never did figure out why the day seemed so short, and I kicked Reggie again for not being of any help. He bit me, too. It hurt terribly and I screamed. His father said that he had never seen a better physical comedy routine, and that he never wanted me to enter his house again.

      Now, I have been mysterious. I will make up some truths about myself, so that you will know who I really am. My name is Mulya Pinkerton, and I was born with a piece of candy already in my mouth. It was a lifesaver, and to this day I still won't eat the lime ones.   Later, I went home to my family. Three sisters, no brothers, two parents, and a black cat with great big yellow eyes. The next day it started to snow. In the end, I was very glad that nobody fixed me a cake, as I had no teeth to eat it with.  Several months passed, and I developed teeth and hair. Several more years passed, and I went to my senior prom, after which I grew older, graduated, and rented my first apartment. At some point, I became a nerd, and began calling upon the earth to cure light wounds. Unfortuanatly, there are really no such things as wood elves. Too bad.   Lately I have learned to fly by flapping my arms while jumping. It only works for a half of a millisecond, but I am making progress.   My hates are egg nog and noise.   My loves are cheese coneys and Ethyl Waters.  I have just been informed that farberwear makes a wonderful pot.  That's my very up-to-date life at present.

      I didn't write for a whole month and two days because I did not feel like talking about wolves any more. I prefer not to write about wolves at all from this day forth.   Instead, I shall deliver a special message regarding the Christmas Fairy. There is no such thing as the Christmas Fairy. There are also no such things as the following:  1. Santa Clause  2. The Easter Bunny  3. Geraldo Rivera  4. The Tooth Fairy  5. Peanuts (also called goober peas)  6. Wood elves  7. Banchees  This concludes my list.

      Some day the world will be a better place. People will not feel bad about who they are. Schools will not teach things that make people feel bad... like math. When students are learning math, it is hard, and it makes them feel bad. Some day, students will not have to learn math, or English, or any other subject that makes them feel bad.   School will be more like a play ground, and children will be free to play and fight and run around as they please. Teachers will not oppress their natural, creative tendencies.   After these students graduate, and grow up and take over the world, and all of the people who might have tried to make them feel bad by being older or smarter or wiser then them will be dead, or locked up in homes to peacefully wilt out of existence. Then, it will be time for them to really mold the world into what it should be.  No longer will humanity be oppressed by society or language, or manners or clothes or dishes. No longer will children suffer under the yolk of modesty, cleanliness, responsibility, or brotherhood. They will live as they were intended to live, naked and free. They will live in gardens and eat from troughs like sophisticated pigs. They will do as they please. No one man will owe debts to another. They will take everything they need from the ground. Water will rain upon them, and they will drink. Fires will burn, and they will be warm.  How proud will they be, the self sufficient men! To have pride is to know that one has succeeded. The sick will not bother, the broken will be, the dead will bury themselves, and the strong will live in harmony with the land. How happy everyone will be!

      It was icy and horrible out today, but it was still nice. The ice was melting because the weather was not cold enough to sustain its tenacity, and I know that it was a disappointment to someone, because I heard a voice in the wind saying, "We've got cold ice today. Let's keep it all nice and cold. It's got to stick to everything now."  Whoever it is that works on our weather every day was having some trouble with the machines, and had really had their hearts set on ice for the whole week. What we have right now has lasted the whole day, but I don't think it's going to stay all week. Most of us are pretty happy, but I feel sorry for the workers, because their supervisor was really getting after them. It wasn't their fault though. Like I said, the machines were broken. Maybe by tomorrow, they'll be working again, but I hope not, because I like it when it starts to get warmer.  I think I know what the problem is, not with the machine, but with the weather company. They don't want to keep producing snow, so they figure if they just keep it cold enough, the streets will be covered in white for longer periods of time, without them having to use the resources to produce as much snow, plus they don't need as many workers that way. I think it's really sad when the weather people start cutting it that close.

      Something happened to my English! For a brief period today - for about the last four hours - I forgot how to speak English, but I spoke Icelandic fluently. Then, just as I learned it all back, I lost my ability to speak any other languages. For that brief period in between, I was having trouble with both of them, but that only last about five seconds. The same thing happened when I was a baby! As soon as I learned how to walk and talk, I lost all of my other skills. I don't remember how to gurgle, coo, or tip over bottles with my mind.   No matter. I'm quite used to things like that, since it's happened twice now. In the future, I only hope that it does not disrupt my flow of creative thought.

      I just want to say that, regardless of what I said in "Sigh of the Moon Dweller" I already know that there is gravity on the moon. I don't understand why everyone who reads that story gets mad at me for saying that there is no gravity on the moon, but is not bothered by me saying that there are trees on the moon with monkeys living in them.  Oh, I know. You all are just pulling my leg, because you already know about the monkeys. No gravity on the moon, wink wink. A clever bunch you are. Trees on the moon. Haha. You don't expect me to fall for that, do you? A bunch of sillies; that's what you are.  Enjoy.

      Here are some stories from the past. I add them to my blogger for your entertainment.   Genes Through Time    Once there were four people named gene who played cricket with another person whose name was also Gene, but whom everyone called Smelly. Smelly owned all the land in the world, except for ninety-nine acres, and the land he didn't own was where everyone else lived. Since all the people were exceedingly small, they couldn't go very far anyway, and that is why they thought the world was flat. Smelly was educated and he believed the world was round, but he was wrong. It was indeed flat. Back then, there weren't any men or women because men and women hadn't been invented yet. Therefore everyone was a circle, a square, or a piece of bubble gum. Also no one ever had time to name their children, because they were too busy creating British dominated sports. Thus, it was assumed that everyone's name was Gene. The four people who were most accomplished at these sports were the Gene called Smelly and the three other Genes, all of whom were mentioned at the beginning of this story. Within the collection of friends, two were squares, one was circular, and the other was a figment of Smelly's imagination. They all got along just fondly, and loved to practice their games together among the blossoms of summers dusk.  As they were playing one evening, they were suddenly interrupted by a grotesque apparition wearing a black coat. The figure beneath the coat was completely white. He had stumpy legs like an elephants and had a menacing grin that stretched from his left eye to a moderate hump on the back of his neck. He stood, grimacing, for two curious moments before abruptly devouring the four companions. Years passed, then centuries. No one ever missed the athletic genes because they hadn't ever really existed. One day, the community decided to build a house on the very spot where the genes would have played, had they been around. The house was made of solid marble. No one ever went in, because there was no entryway, and no one ever came out, because it was empty. At one point the being appeared inside of the house and disgorged the genes, including the one called Smelly. The city council decided the house should be destroyed. Once they had cracked through the first wall, they met the Genes, as well as the entity in the black coat. They were perplexed that those who had not existed should materialize within a sealed stone house. The Genes explained that it was quit simple, for they had merely torn away from nothing, creating a deep void in Time that would suck them up so that they had never existed at all, and then spit them out so that they had always been. Then everyone understood and was happy. The figure in the black coat opened his mouth.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Entrails of the Sea Life    A man named Labon who was wealthy with a family inheritance went on a long sail in the middle of an uncharted sea. A little over half way through his journey, the winds became still, and he was able to admire the fathomless depth of his surroundings during a period of leisurely coasting. While he was about, he came upon something that startled him at first, and then drew him near, as it was an object of interest. It appeared to be a rubber ball, and it was red with yellow stripes. In order to be perfectly certain of its nature, he poked it several times with a long stick. To his genuine surprise, it spoke to him. "That is both painful and annoying," it remarked, irritably, "I wish you would stop." "I'm sorry," said Labon, "I assumed you were a rubber ball, but now that I have a closer look, I can see that you are actually a very short man with neither limbs, nor a head.  The man replied, "As a matter of fact, I am a sea captain who has lost my ship. If you help me to high shores, where I can contact my crew, you will be sure to receive a great reward.  Labon chuckled heartily, "What could you possibly have to offer me? I see no jewels on your body, and your clothes are not of fine linens. You are not rich enough to grant me any truly desirable possessions." "I am unable to help myself," answered the desperate vagabond. Yet Labon was suspicious by nature, and he replied, "You are probably a liar." With that, he dropped him into the water, and the sea captain sank deep into the muddy recesses of lost cities. Not a tremendous time later, the wealthy sailor decided to inhabit a remote island where, having nothing else to do, he began digging holes in the shapes of different animals. As he was digging out an eye for his raccoon shape, he hit upon something very hard, which turned out to be a chest full of treasures to grand to consider.  He pulled the chest out of the ground, saying to himself, "This must be the great treasure that the man I met was speaking of. If only I could thank him now for his generous efforts to give me things. Labon felt a deep sense of regret. He sat listlessly on a rock for several hours, crying sorrowful tears of his guilt. Having become remarkably distressed, he tore off his cloak and filled it with the contents of the chest. Afterwards, he threw the heavy bundle into the sea. It drifted hither and tither for a few anxious moments, until finally being devoured by a clan of poisonous jellyfish. That night, Labon dreamt of being stuck in the nose by a thousand needles, one at a time. When he awoke, he discovered a letter beside himself with only the four following words inside it: You are a fool, which he read aloud. This was most perplexing to him, for until that point he had been completely illiterate.  As Labon headed home the sea was calm, and when he reached his destination he recalled having had a very lovely time abroad for, he said, "It is the one time when I have left, and then come back as well." Everyone laughed agreeably and invited him to join them in suitable festivities, which he did. At midnight, all of the people turned into beautifully garnished platters of fish. Later the next evening, they all disappeared. The whole event was a distinct success, and everyone agreed that they should all do it again next year.  The End   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Mid Journey    On the side where once our fathers  Said the heavens met the earth Was a land that had not yet Been burnt away, And the trees, their branches all bore fruit  That ripened red and sweet And every babe was fed, And ne'er the skies were grey, And the skies were ever blue and all was day.  I had made my way to go there  Though an idle sloth I be,  I had dreamt of all the wealth and strength to see.  I was taken by the woods,  I was distracted by the dreams  And I tarried where one oughtn't ever be,  And so I slew the wealth and strength I'd promised me.   As I dawdled on the pathway, Calling obstacles to come  Before that land of wealth and paradise I sought  Then a tearful man came running down the path I lingered on,  Looking sick and shaken, fearful and distraught  And he asked if I may listen and be taught.  He said, "I went to seek my strength, I went to seek a fortune there,  In the place they say the earth gave way to sea,  And the earth concluded there it seemed,  And the heav'n did there begin,  For there I found what earth had never offered me." "He said," "I found the love that earth had never offered me."  "And her name meant all that sings," He said, "And her skin was silk and bronze,  And her lips weren't red with roses but with fire, And her passion was not lust or greed, but mighty want for life  And her voice was like the strumming of a lyre."  And then he cried,  "And I knew my love for her could never tire."  "We were soon there to be married  In that place where beauty be,  Where the people grew like sunflowers from the ground  And I said, 'But I must leave you. I will search a home for us  'Til that holiday of union comes around'  And we parted on a melancholy sound."  "I was left for not a week, my friend,  When my heart grew sick for her  And I wondered why I ever left her side,  And I turned around to find her, Just to be with her again,  But when I got there someone told me she had died! And I prayed to God my wearied ears had lied."  "I asked who else had known her  And they said they knew her name, But a man had dug her grave a week before,  For the town had been in frenzy, She was trampled underfoot In a riot like precursory to war." And then he told me what the riot had been o'er.  But I said "You needn't tell me,"  To the anguish beaten man, "There's a wild eye in the soberest of rings, And a mass can be enchanted  By the whispering of the wind  So their bodies are possessed by savage things,  And in the morning they are docile once again.  And I said some words to comfort him. What vacant sympathy.  Then he turned to me and said "They did not care." "For they did not wrap her body And they prayed not o'er her soul  And they took from her the ribbons in her hair. They gave their daughters satin ribbons from her hair."  He said "You seek a crystal haven  In a place of legend told  Of a land so bright you'd fall upon your knees, But the women are like baubles, And the men are made of stone, And the babes all eat the embers of the trees.  I am the last to miss the heavens for the seas.  "So my sister don't console me  For the face I wear this hour, For you are no more safe from dying in the cold."  At the point his words were ringing from the howling of a storm, And I envisioned that his sobs instead were gold, And I am walking to that land of legend told.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sad Sad River Mountain      Life was a continuous chasm.    A man decided to put an end to the whole ugly deal, and so with the exclamation, "I am all that is worth living for!" he threw himself into a river which was filled with catfish and human corpses. The better to bring down the rest of mankind thought the man, but on all of earth there were only two people who cared for him, and they were strong souls and did not follow.    When he fell in, the river became too full of corpses and one of them had to step out to make room for the man. This was the corpse of a woman whose career had become to greatly of a burden, and thus she had ended her life prematurely. She had not been missed by any but four people, and they were strong souls and did not follow.   The dead woman buried herself beneath a mountain where she had been born at one time. People who did not know her threw flower petals over her grave, because they felt sorry for her.   A giant ogre with sixteen personalities discovered the mountain and destroyed it completely. His neighbor had beaten him in the head with a mountain when he was a child. Therefore, no one knew where the suicide victim had buried herself.   The man who had thrown himself in the river was still alive. The catfish were swimming around him and he was beginning to feel synaesthetic. The river was singing, and the faint gurgle of swimming life was the color of fire. The man began to scream. He hoped that he would live to reclaim what was once his - the love of two people and his own portion of Earth.    The man did live, and he returned to his home where the two people who loved him cried and welcomed him. They were glad to see him. They were angry that he had left them, but they were forgiving.   He and the two people who loved him and the giant ogre with sixteen personalities were the four people in the world who cared for the woman buried beneath the mountain, but she was dead.   The mountain was gone, no one remembered where it had been, and death flowed in the river.   Nobody in the world loved the giant ogre.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Sigh of the Moon Dweller   There was once a young man from the moon who wondered about the meaning of life and death.  Of life he said, "Ah, it is love to its fullest, but what is life to a mortal? Only a phase," and he was troubled thus. A monkey who was in a nearby moon tree heard this lamenting and replied, "Oh, you don't appreciate the importance of life! First of all, let us dissect your own words and see if you are really capable of making these assumptions. What is love to its fullest? It is true the Lord gave us life because he loves us, and life may be the reciprocal of love, and it gives us the capacity to love, but you say 'What is it?' as if to imply that it is nothing." "Indeed I did," replied the adolescent, "for life is grand and valuable until its inescapable demise. What use is it to live for a year, when you are to die or an eternity? The money said to him, "I would think you might ask, 'Why do I live on the moon?' Instead you ask, 'why does a mortal man live?' This is the greatest puzzlement of all, for when you come to an end you will know nothing of the things you sought. You spend a moment asking what the meaning is, and the next moment saying there are no solutions to your queries. I can help you answer these things, but not today. I must feed my children instead." With that, the monkey scurried back into his tree, and was not seen again. The young man pondered these statements briefly, and at the same moment was confronted by a butterfly who fluttered fro and to, twittering as gaily as a handsome spring day.  "You are small and fragile, but also beautiful," he told the creature.  "I am," said the butterfly, "and not meek like the birds and insects who hide among the leaves to sing. I, rather, invite the world to gaze at me this way and see how much like a perfect painting I am." "But you are not a piece of art, and this is the moon, not the world." At that time, the butterfly was floating away, singing to himself, and the fellow on the moon wondered why does a butterfly have wings if it is to exist in an atmosphere without gravity? Just then, he met a clicking bug who said nothing, but clicked, and appeared to dislike him. The young man felt so frustrated by this that, finally, he tossed upwards his hands and gave a deep sigh of resignation. When he did this, however, he made a noise that was like a storm to the clicking bug, who was very small. The bug fancied that the sigh of the moon dweller was a monstrous gust of wind, and his arms the waving of trees. It was a silly fancy to take, because a clicking bug ought to know that there are not windstorms on the moon. However, people are always taking silly fancies, and the clicking bug was no exception, so he ran away to spare its life under a toadstool. The young man watched the bug, perplexed. A clicking bug, a small creature who seemed insignificant, guarded its own life with every resource available, as it cowered under the spotted fungus, and dug its feet into the ground. The butterfly, far away, continued to sing in a merry tone, and spread its beauty to all.  He watched this, and listened, and then said to no one, "These tiny creatures are fools! They save their lives for a morning on which they will no longer be, and they savor hours which are only fitted to conquer them!" He had grown cynical just by watching living things because he did not understand why they should be at all. Then he began to wonder, if they were going to be, even in spite of what was logical, why then were they the way they were? Why were they small, and why did they make the moon their home? Suddenly he began to realize that there were so many things that seemed illogical, like the wings of a butterfly who could well do without them, and the great sighs he made, although there was no air to breath. There were so many confusions and perplexities that he could have spent a lifetime discovering them all.  Just as he once asked "Why should there be life?" he now cried out about the complexities which he encountered, and he could not say that his or anyone else's existence was futile, for he knew that each one would be spent in discovery for all of its days. Then, when his final hour was about, all of the universe was opened to him, and the questions he had were answered with one single utterance -- and he understood the answers which unlocked all of life's great mysteries, because he remembered having asked the questions a long time before. So went the life of the fellow on the moon, and so too went his death. As he had sought and wondered with an opened heart, peace then betook him, and never a life was belittled by a creature on the moon.  The End

      Well, I did not write a new entry in my blogger when I said I would, which can mean only one thing: I, Mulya Pinkerton, am a big fat liar. Horror of horrors! How I detest a liar. They are simply detestable.   My brain is completly dry. I keep wanting to tell you about some toads I once had, but I cannot seem to explain it in the same detail as I did in the first story that was erased.   Today, I shall simply copy and paste old stories, so that they will be on this blog. Then, perhaps something new will come into my life and I will be able to tell you about it.

        Today is a day full of goodnes and growth. In a manner of speaking, every day is one like this, but today is special because it just happens to be my day of goodness and growth. If you should say that it is only special to me, and that every other day is still just as special, then we shall be turning in circles. The point is that this is a particularly good day for me, and it happens to be the 3 month and 13 day anniversary of my blog. To celibrate, I shall make you, the reader, a birthday cake.        Before you read this, close your eyes so that you can imagine everything that you are reading, but keep one eye just squinted but not quite closed, so that you can read it. Now, imagine a cake that is ten feet tall. It has 15 layers, because each one of them is 1/3 of a foot tall, and they are seperated by little columns, like on a wedding cake. Five of the layers are chocolate, five of the layers are strawberry, and five of them are carrot cake, but they are all covered in white icing, and all over the sides are pink roses made out of icing.   The top says, "Happy Birthday to you" in cursive. The cursive writing is vertical. It has no slant, and the loops on the y's are large, and the a's are slightly open at the top, because it was written by a very outgoing person with an optomistic additude and a strong spirit. So that you can tell them apart, the carrot cakes have little pictures of carrots on them, the strawberry cake has little pictures of strawberries, in addition to roses, and the chocolate ones have pictures of eyeballs. OH NO! That's unpleasant. Scratch that. The chocolate ones have pictures of Charlie on them. I'm not sure who Charlie is.    I think I'll go ahead and start a new entry tonight. I had a story about my real life that I was going to share with you one night, but I got booted and it was erased. I was so angry that I chopped down a tree. Just kidding. That would be cruel. It wasn't a tree at all.

      I once knew a girl who was pretty enough that she left pink finger prints on everything she touched. It wasn't as though she were filthy with pink particals all over her hands, but she was simply pretty and aloof, and every time she touched anything, everything about her rubbed off, and when it did, it was pink.   I always thought, what a terrible way to be: To not be able to keep anything to herself, even if she wanted to, -- for who can go her whole life without touching anything? -- and I even thought of buying her a pair of gloves, but I realised that for some reason she didn't want anything like that. Then one day it occured to me: The girl was completely color blind. She had no idea that it was happening. Then I thought, I would very much like to be like that girl, and never see the affect that I had on things around me. Then I could niether be proud nor ashamed of myself for any reason throughout my entire life. Most of all, I could never be ashamed of my pride, or proud of my shame.  On a day very much like this one, about a year ago, I went walking with her, and we came upon something that would have been completely in the ordinary if it hadn't appeared in the order that it did. Whether it was by the lake on the shore, or on the shore by the park, or under the roof of my home I cannot remember, but clearly in my memory I will always bare the vision of three red fish lying beside three perfectly round stones.   Stones and fish, you see, are perfectly ordinary, but when they are together in the manner of which they were, it makes one question the motives of the situation. I will never forget what my young friend said of this.  The young lady tilted her head and with slight hesitation she remarked, "I am much more like a fish than a rock."  "Me too," I said. It was the last time I spoke to my friend, and now I don't even remember her name.

      Today, I don't feel like being here at all. Things are a little too much for me, and that's why I haven't written in a while. It turns out that I really am just a statue made out of stone. I mean, naturally, I have been animated, so that I am a lot like a real, flesh person, or otherwise I would not be able to type right now, but the fact is, I have suspected for a long time that I was a statue, and I finally asked my mom and she said, "Yes, Mulya, you were a statue, but we sort of wanted to see what it would be like to bring you to life."  Oh, I know I said I was born and all, but that was just a cover up. A few years ago I went to the doctor to undergo several tests. I was afraid of what was happening to my body because my feet and hands were cold too often, and I was always getting the shakes. I told him I had dizzy spells too, and he mentioned the possibility that I might be hypoglycemic.   "That may be true," I said, "but don't you think that it may also be true that once I was a statue carved out of stone, and that is why I have a chip missing from my chin, and why I often feel very cold?"   "That may be a distinct possibility," said the doctor, "But I suggest we test your blood/sugar levels before jumping to any conclusions."  It seemed like a sound idea, so, although I am afraid of needles, I scheduled a date for the test. We also made plans to test my heart because it likes to skip beats sometimes. To tell you the truth, I just wanted to make sure I did indeed have a heart in there and not just a rock.  It took the nurse several times to find a vain in my arm. In fact, it took so long, and so many needles, that by the time she was done I felt that I had quite faced my fears about needles and doctors and hospitals, but that didn't mean I got to leave. Rather, I stayed there all day drinking cup after unsavory cup of orange syrup. Come to think of it, it was just one cup, but one was quite enough. I also had my middle finger pricked at least sixty times.   After the nurse had taken my blood, she fainted on the floor. I asked the doctor what had happened, and he looked at me with his old grey eyes and calmly explained that her time had come. This was surprising, because, although I never saw her wake up, I felt that she still seemed alive some how, for she was still pink and breathing. None the less, I never saw her again.  The doctor told me that my blood sugar was not low, but insisted that I was in fact hypoglycemic. I found this slightly specious, but at the time I chose to believe it over the alternative. The following week I had someone listen to my heart and view it with a sonogram. I was informed that I had a heart murmur: a swishing sound that occurred every few beats, of the beats it didn't miss.   "But," said the doctor, "this is highly insignificant, which is to say, it is hardly significant at all. I suggest that you go home and rest this off."  Sleep it off? I did not believe that this was possible.   "Are you trying to kill me?" I asked.  "Yes," said the doctor, "but slowly and subtly, so please don't act like you noticed like that. We went through a lot of planning for this to be VERY subtle and slow."  I remember that on that day, I felt very disappointed for some reason, and I trudged mindlessly through the forest until I had reached the very edge of the earth, which is located almost precisely where the horizon and the sky meet. I peered off of the end of the world for a while, and I even considered jumping, but it occurred to me that I had no idea where the open space beyond would lead me, if it lead to any place at all, and I didn't even have my jacket on that day.  After that I went home, and sat at the kitchen window where I gazed into the back yard, and here is what I saw:   I saw a tree covered in pink lilacs with branches that swept the brushwood beneath like a weeping willow. I saw a grey mass like a gelatinous boulder sleeping beside it and a rabbit loping through a field of golden eyed jonquils. I saw a deep green moss sprouting from the sides of the tree, and growing out from beneath the stones that lay scattered upon the ground, and a foggy puddle soothing itself with reflections of the sky. I also saw a space where something used to be, but I could not seem remember what once might have occupied the spot -- only that something once did.  The thing sleeping beneath the tree, the grey boulder-like thing, that is our boarder, Lunquin. He only wakes up once or twice a month, and it is only long enough to move to another area of the yard. He does not seem to like the indoors at all. He is completely unsociable, and rather a fright to look at, but he pays us well, and he never caused any complaints from the neighbors.  I asked the fellow if he remembered what used to be in the spot that seemed so empty. He was a little grumpy at having been awakened, but was obliged to speak to me once he felt right with the day, and I fixed him some black tea with honey.  I told him about everything that had happened with the doctors and tests, and how the nurse had fainted, and I had gone to the end of the world, and some back to look at the backyard, only to notice an empty space and be dismayed.  "Why that spot has been empty for years." Lunquin grumbled, raising his moutainous head to mine, "At least twenty of them. Maybe less."  He was starting to get tired again, but I implored him to stay awake for a while and try to remember what had once been there. He looked at me. His eyes were grey like the doctor's, but fuller, like someone who had seen many things and kept every vision he had ever had right there in his eyes, so as not to lose them in the depths of his memory.   I thought, so this is why old Lunquin is always so tired. He has the whole world to keep track of.   I asked him one more time, "Lunquin, what used to be in that spot near the flowers?"  "You and a statue." He said, and fell back into a slumber.  Well, that was at least a few years ago, maybe less. Today I was thinking about that spot again, even though the tree is gone now, and so are all the flowers and the stones. They are either gone or covered in that green moss I that I had first noticed encroaching into our yard on that day I spoke of. Everything got covered in it except Lunquin, and so I suppose he does have some means of keeping it off. The spot is also covered in the moss so that it doesn't look so empty. Still, I know that something else used to be there.  After a little bit of research, I discovered that our yard was once part of a palace garden. Well, the whole yard wasn't, but a relative of mine, Great Aunt Babs, once visited a palace in Dreads Fram and brought back the ashes of one of the palace garden trees that had caught fire during a drought. She sprinkled the ashes on our flowers one year when she was visiting for New Years Eve. I found a picture of the back of the house and the back yard, and in the corner of the picture is a granite statue.   Well, to make a very long story short, I knew immediatly that that statue was me, and when I asked my mom about it she admitted that yes, it was indeed me, and that one year before I had been brought to life, I had been dropped and had my chin nicked by a nail that was on the ground. She also told me that it was raining that day, and that it had been very cold, and I had carried that into my life when I became a flash and blood person. Because I was made of stone, I was cold often, and because it had been raining, there would always be the whooshing sound of water in my heart.   "Well," I said, "That exaplains the murmer and the cold hands, but what about the nurse that fainted while I was being tested, and the doctor that acted as though she had died?"  "Oh well," said my mom, "I never really trusted that doctor."

      Today will be a nice day, I guess. I will do whatever I have to, and then I will come home and do whatever I have to again. If I'm lucky, there will be a chinese buffet somewhere between. I'm going to gain 20 pounds this month, eating chinese food, but it will be good weight. It will be for the tail I'm growing. I'm using all of my controlling powers to grow wings and a tail. It's easier to grow wings because they are just flat and thin... hmm... unless I want good strong wings. Then, I guess I will have to start by growing an extra pair of arms on my back, and then elongating the fingers, and growing extra skin and all... Hmm. That will be hard.  A tail is kind of complicated too, because of all the little joints and everything, but it at least doesn't entail growing any extra parts -- just making my spine longer. Maybe I'll do without the tail and just go for the wings. Tails kind of get in the way. Wings, on the other hand, they can be very useful as long as you now how to dress with them. The secret to that is wearing tops that wrap around, rather than going over the head. I expect I would get a lot of attention if I had wings, unless I decided to simply live in the trees, and just swoop down every once in a while to snag some lunch. In that case, I might need a tail.  It's probably kind of hard to just swoop down at a Chinese buffet, because of the roof, but I could always send someone in for me, and then swoop down and take it from them. It's not really preditorial though, if I hired someone to go in there. My legs aren't really built for a flyer, but I guess I could fold them up under me.  Now, if I'm going to have wings, I think I should have pointy ears too. That shouldn't be hard to do. It probably won't really help me hear or anything, but it would look nice, and I could grow my hair out and make it all purple and green and irridescent to match my wings. It sounds gaudy, but I can see it all in my head and it doesn't look bad. I would wear a lot of flowers and stuff, and my little wrap around top. Now, what to wear on the bottom, that's a problem. It looks nice to wear a flowy black skirt, but think about it: if I'm flying around a lot and wearing a skirt, then people are going to be able to see my underwear. I'd better just wear my green puffy pants and a sash. That's better anyway, because I don't want to spill sweet and sour sauce on my nice black skirt. I think I'll just throw out the tail idea all together.

      O me, there is nothing to think about and nothing to say.   The big people are coming. I heard them say it on the radio. I heard them say it on the news, and I heard them saying it on the other side of the door while I was hiding behind it this morning. The big people are coming.  The big people are coming! They approach!   As the distance between us diminishes, I cry out to my loved ones, "Hurry! Hide, at once! I hear them outside our window!"  I saw a boy riding past on a brown pony carrying a letter with a red ribbon around it. I tried to stop him, but he just kept on going. I called out to him, and asked him what the letter said.  "I don't know," he called back, "I can't read! But the letters are this: T-h-e space b-i-g space p-e-o-p-l-e space a-r-e space c-o-m-i-n-g!" He was riding on his pony, and I on my bike, following. His name was Madison. I know because I asked him, right before we were seperated by the speed of his animal. I wonder where he was going.  He came back about an hour later, still on his pony. He introduced it to me.   "This," he said, "Is Dolly. She is my pony, and I am a pony courier."   I had heard from a friend that the big people were coming, and I asked Madison if he knew anything about them.   "Not much," he admitted, "Except that I know it's very bad if they find you. If they find you, they'll make you disappear, but if they see you working very hard -- I mean very hard, harder than you've ever worked before -- then they might let you go. That's why Dolly and I got this job. I wouldn't want them to make her disappear either."  I've heard all kinds of things about them, but I have never seen them. Once I thought I saw them. There were several men standing about in a construction site. They were very big, bigger than any men I had ever seen, and they were all dressed alike, too.   They were laughing and talking and eating sandwiches, and suddenly I heard one of them say, "Hurry and get to work! The big people are coming!" I went up to them to ask about the big people, but one of them just threw a hammer to me and told me not to look up until the big people were gone.  "If they see you face, they'll steal your soul," said one man.  As we worked, I heard footsteps approaching. Louder and louder they got, until each one sounded like a clap of thunder. When they had gone, I asked the men what they were building.   "Nothing at all," they told me, "Why if we ever finished, the big people would come and take us away, so we just keep working and working."  "My job is to build it," said one man.  "And my job is to tear it down," called another man from the back.  "They can't take my soul by looking at my face." I told them, "Only God can say where my soul goes."   One man shrugged, "All I know is that the big people are very big." When he said it, I saw a sweat break right above his brow, and I knew at once that we were dealing with a powerful force.  I heard them say that the big people were coming today. We'd better all run for our lives.

      As I have yet to finish the post of Feb 19, there is very little that I can bring myself to say.   Pickle pickle why you stare You have been  my only care Step into  my wily lair So that I  can eat you there  more poems about pickles:  green with little lumps long and tasty, like frogs legs but a vegetable  and also:  You were once a beet, it were, tended carefully "Pickled, fate of cucumbers," You said, "That won't be me." But there you are  in vinegar A product in a jar And, although you're red and round, Isn't that what pickles are?

      I scraped my nose. I have been working very hard on a post, and when I am done it will still say that I have done nothing since feb 19, so when I finish, I will toss a new post to celibrate. It will be the grandest post of tham all.  It's very hard to look at a person with a scab on her nose in the eyes. I always thought that was hard, and then I proved my theory by getting a scab on my nose. It's also very hard for me to look into someone's eye's when there is a scab on my nose, because they are too busy looking at it to give me the oppertunity to make eye contact. It hurts, because am a social creature.   :'(   I must now begin all of my conversations in person with, "I scraped my nose." which inevidably leads to an explanation of  why  I scraped my nose. Well, I scraped my nose because things like that happen sometimes, that's why, and I was tired of people asking me what happened to my chin. My chin has a red mark on it, because I scratched it.   That's why I like my dinosaur. He never asks me any questions. It's true that sometimes he eats my friends for lunch, but its a sacrifice I'm willing to make. It is, after all, for the good of preservation.

      World Undone Prelude  My dear friend, we have missed each other for a long time. I remember the day exactly, when you and I parted. I had been preparing for weeks on end. The hour before you came, I was in your house, making all of the final touches.  I ran ribbons up and down the hallways and pressed them tight with paste, and wrote your name on them over and over. I felt that I was doing a tremendous job. When at last you arrived, you would see what a good deed I had done, and call me a very nice person.  I strung ribbons of all different colors throughout each room. I pulled them up over the furniture and through the doorways, and made little tassels which I hung out the window. It was all to celebrate your arrival.  Most of the ribbons were white, and most of them were about as wide as my index finger. I glued them all over your house. I covered your ceiling and your floors, and wrapped them around your ceiling fan and wove them through your air conditioning vents. I wrote your name on each one. I used a big staple gun to hang them like streamers in the doorways and over the television. You were going to be so excited when you got home.  I tied bows on all of your forks and knives. I scrawled your name across your best serving spoon, which was wrapped tightly in violet and baby blue. I made little ribbon puffs and stapled them to your favorite chair. You were going to be so happy.   Then you came home. You opened the door and saw the ribbons. You smiled a great big smile that showed all of your teeth. Your eye's turned into gold coins. Your lips were strawberry twists. Your whole face became a marshmallow. One by one, each of your features became like candy. Your eyes were chocolate. Your legs turned into peppermint sticks. Your hair became cotton candy. The whole shape of your body became abstract. Slowly, slowly, you fell into a pile on the floor.   I turned on the radio, which was covered in tiny pink bows. The music was like a saw beating against a metal box. It had no melody. The ribbons fell around my head and I screamed. I picked up the phone to call the doctor, but the man on the other end was playing a slide whistle. I began to cry. A jingle came on the radio. It was one you used to dance to.   Mr. Lucky's Cherry Cough Syrup. One teaspoon will calm your throat, two will make you glad, four will make you see nice things, and eight will drive you mad. Mr. Lucky's cherry cough syrup.     Though still in peices, you took to a rythmic movement. You scattered while you were dancing, and danced right into the grates, right through the ribbons with which I had so caringly decked them. You danced right into the ventilation system.  Your house turned into a space ship. I did not know that your house had space ship capabilities. I heard your voice speak.   "Oh yes, my house has spaceship capabilities," you said. I did not know that people that had turned into candy could read minds. Where ever your house was going, I did not want to follow, so I leapt out of the window.  The ground caved in below me. It turned into liquid. I swam to the top, and I heard a voice calling my name. I tried to turn around but a man with dead tree branches for hands was knocking on my head. I asked him to stop, and his eyes turned red.   "I'm sorry, I have red eyes," he said. "I'm actually a very nice man, but sometimes my eyes glow red. It is hereditary. I didn't mean to scare you."  I'm not sure if I believed him or not, but all the same I made distance between us. I looked up to where the house had been. What I had thought was a spaceship was really nothing. There was no sign of a house. I was standing at the edge of a lake. Nothing that I had just seen was there, although I knew that it was there.  I cupped my hands over my mouth and whispered your name. I heard a loud echo over the lake, which disrupted a flock of birds. As I watched them fly up into the sky, I noticed that they were carrying the ribbons. Each bird grasped a bunch of the ribbons which were tangled like a giant net. Clouds of ribbon hung from the mess. I began running toward them.   I ran swiftly, tripping over rocks and sticks, but never falling. I felt a hard smack against my whole body. I had run into the man with branches for arms. The birds flew away with the ribbons, and I watched them, and I sobbed. I sat down on the ground, and the man hugged me.   "Although this all seems terrible," he said, "This is really a lot like a dream, isn't it?"  "Yes," I answered, "It is an awful lot like a dream. Is it a dream after all?"  The man looked at me. His eyes were like glowing embers. It seemed as though he could tell I didn't like it and was trying to tone them down.   "No," he said to me, "This is not a dream, but you must act like it is, for the reality of this world is melting away."  I asked him, "What shall I do?"  "You must stop it from happening," he said, "You must discover where the fire is."  He told me that whatever was destroying reality was coming either from the outside or the inside, but no one could tell.   "How long?" I asked, "How long have we been falling apart?"  "Many years," said the man, "You, yourself, have participated in the bizzarities of our transformation, with out even knowing it. Without even knowing it... You, yourself have become a part of this melting candle of a universe. How did you figure that ribbons were what a person wanted?"  "They love ribbons," I told him.  I could not remember who you were. I knew that you were either a man or a woman. I knew that I had spoken to you before, and that you had spoken to me, and that you had a name, for I had whispered it beneath my cupped hands just a few moments before, and the lake had screamed it back to me.  I asked the man, “Did you hear me calling a name over the lake?” Perhaps he would remember.   “I can hear nothing,” said the man, “But what this profane world allows me to hear. I am so much one of its members; I am beginning to turn into a part of its forest.”  It was then that I understood that the fire he had spoken of was inside of him. I told him this.   “There is a fire burning,” I said, “And when I look at you, I see it.”  The fire in the man’s eyes leapt about. One eye went dark. The other burned brightly, splashing its colors over his face, as if it could not be controlled, even by him. He began to swat at it, but immediately ceased, remembering that his arms were made of wood.  “I am not a bad man,” he repeated, “I was born this way.”  There was a path that started at my feet. It seemed to lead through a forest, but as I walked, the forest around me was cleared away without ever moving. My head felt light, and I wondered if I was not walking around a loop that went up-side-down, and over, and landed me right where I had started. If there was a power that led me, it would lead me right next to myself. I stepped off of the path and wandered through the shallow edges of the lake. Suddenly it occurred to me that I was alone. I turned back. I wanted to call for the man with branches for arms, but I did not know his name. I wondered about you. I began to think that perhaps he and you were one in the same.   I shouted, “Hey! Man!” I still could not remember your name. I heard the shuffle of his feet, and ran away. I ran for quite some time. I ran until I was out of breath, and more thirsty than I had ever been in my life. I looked down, searching for the lake, but it was not there. I felt pangs of hunger. I had not eaten or drank in several hours. Something near me moved, and I looked up. I saw a face before me. Its eyes were burning. It was my face, and I was gazing into a mirror.   “It is inside us,” I heard a voice say. I turned around, and saw nothing. I was spinning, trying to find the source of the voice. It was my voice, for I had spoken my thoughts out loud. I turned to the mirror again. It had no sides. It was solid, but feathered out into space from the middle, so that it gradually became nothing as one moved towards the edges, like a picture fading into white. Around me was a field.   “There are rabbits in this field,” I said. “There must be. Rabbits live in fields. They live in warrens under the ground in fields. There is life under me. There are insects and moles and larva waiting for the proper time to reveal themselves. This is not a lifeless field.” I said this because it was my greatest fear, that I had been mystically quarantined from life because of what I knew.  I closed my eyes, trying to snuff out the fire with my lids. The man had seen them all along and was trying to protect me from the truth. He had been born with it, he said. I had acquired it. I tried to remember your name again. I wanted to go back and find the man, for I was all alone, but I did not know where to turn.   Opposite of the mirror, said a voice in my head. That is where I came from. First I had to find the mirror again. It was there, before me. I looked into it again, and felt enormous grief and fear. I wondered if I should venture to look at the other side. What is on the other side of a reflection? I looked. Blackness. Blackness absorbs light, but it absorbs all light. Mirrors only reflect enough light to make a picture, so the back of one aught to absorb only enough light to serve the same function. I gazed into the dark. It shifted, changing to my reasoning. I saw a negative image of myself.  Is that how it works now? I thought. Then the man with the branch arms should be standing next to me.   He was.   I asked him, “How did you get here?”  “I get many places,” he said, “and I have never asked why. I go, and I arrive. The dynamics are without reason.”  “They are not,” I said, “I reasoned you here.” So I could reason, and it would be done.   At first I felt powerful. I began to reason all of the things that I wanted at that moment. I reasoned that I should have food, drink, and comfort. I had food and drink, but they were nothing I had ever seen before. The food was the raw heart of an animal, and the drink was green and bitter.   I said aloud, “It goes to reason that I should have crab-cakes and snap peas with rice, and that I should have a glass of water and a glass of white wine.”  I had these things. How specific I had to be. While I was eating I talked to the man. I spoke like someone who was seeing an old friend for the first time in years. Through chewed greens I prattled on about my new finding.  “Why, with this power,” I exclaimed, spitting tiny darts of food, “I could make everything the way it should be. I could put buildings where there were buildings, and streets around them with people walking on them. I could think houses and yards with tree stumps and bushes along the fence, and people inside of them reading to their children and playing games, and schools with teachers, and factories and stores. I could make everything…”  “…The way it used to be,” finished the man.  When he spoke, I glanced upwards, just to see his face, but I saw that behind him, buildings had grown, as if from the ground. Streets had been built. Houses were in the distance. Everything that had once been seemed to be again. I leapt for joy. I was so pleased that I hugged the man, and then jumped up and ran towards the city. As I approached it I could make out some details, such as the striped socks on a child, and tags jingling on the collar of a running dog, and a label on a bottle of whisky that had been discarded on the street.   The street signs, however, had no names on them. Some of them did, like the signs for the larger streets with names that I could remember, but as I walked through the neighborhoods, many of the signs had nothing on them, or else all was gibberish that I did not understand. A woman in a sweatshirt walked by, pushing a baby carriage. Her hair was dark, and her facial features were sharp. The same woman walked by again on the next street. This time she was wearing a dress and she was blonde. She pushed the same carriage. As I brushed past the carriage, I peered into it slyly. It was empty. When she had passed, I turned to watch her go. I noticed the buildings behind me had started to melt. I turned around and the houses and trees before me had, also. They stopped when I looked at them. They started again when I turned away.   I looked for the man with the branch arms again.   “This is what you wanted,” he said calmly, “No one else wanted this. I brought your food.” He held up the heart, and the nasty green potion.  “What do they want?” I asked.   “Many things,” he said, “Each person wants something different.”  I looked around for you, although I still could not remember what you looked like. Where ever you were, you were making a world for yourself too. The woman walked by again, this time in a black suit. Her hair was red. Her face was familiar. It was the face of someone off of a television commercial, or a soap ad, or a picture I had seen once – only now, she wasn’t anybody. As I was thinking about her, the city began to wane, and as I stood in the midst of it I began to wish for real things.   “Man,” I said to the man, as I had yet to ask his name, “Why are you the only other one besides me who is really here?”  “My name,” answered the man, “Is Mr. Pearl. I have told you that several times.”  Horrors chilled my heart. I had seen this man before and forgotten him. I had conversed with him, exchanged names with him, and he had escaped my memory completely. I gazed into the distance to clear my mind. The city dissolved before me in slow motion. The roofs of the buildings slid down the walls in gummy masses. Beneath it, like an old painting, was the field.   “I came to you through the field,” remarked Mr. Pearl.   I asked him, “Who does the field belong to?” He sighed gently and shifted his body.  “A man who remembers grass,” he said, “All day long he looks into his field. He does not waste energy on what belongs there. He just concentrates on that grass. He remembers that green grass should be beautiful.”  “There is no dirt beneath it?”  “There is no dirt beneath it,” confirmed Mr. Pearl.   “I cannot dig a hole in that field?”  “You cannot dig a hole in his field,” he smiled, I believe, for the first time, “You can walk on his field, an if you do that you can walk right to him, but if you walk through your own city, you can walk for ever and ever and never see a soul.”  “I see you,” I said, “and I can see myself if there is a mirror.”  He smiled again, “How good of you to see a mirror.” His eyes were dim and placid. They were smoky, but beneath the smoke, I thought I could see real eyes. He felt out the ground with his stick fingers, and scooped up a clump of dirt and grass. A worm wriggled out from between his fingers. He held the moist dirt to his face and breathed deeply through his nose, then offered it to me to imitate his actions, but I declined.   “I was waiting for this day, a long time ago. Once this world of ours was so far gone, I used to see you walking the way I do, and I thought, there is someone like me! But you never could remember my name…” He was at ease now, as though a rock had been removed from his stomach, and in his eyes I could see his humanity. His eyes were deep blue – eyes that could put out fires. He still held the clump of dirt.  “This is the earth,” he said. A tear started down his cheek and, as he could not wipe it away, continued to his chin, making its way through a maze if stubble, and seeped into a crease in his neck.  He continued,”This spot of earth is a straggler, like us. It’s real. I didn’t think there was anything left.”  I asked him, “What shall we do?”  “We mustn’t assume that this is the very last,” he said, to much in awe to answer my question. The place where we were was a lot like the beginning, you see. Once there was a man, a woman, and an unsullied piece of land. So it begins, I thought, and so it ends. He saw me thinking this, and then considered my question.  “We cannot cast aside what we have already become a part of. We must move. We can base our map on this piece of land, for if we stand in the center, we will see that there are unchanging directions, not like the world out there. You go east, and I’ll go west. Find everyone you can who is willing, and bring them back here.”  “Walk into their worlds?” I said.  “Walk into their worlds and keep your own,” he stammered, “to your own.” I could see that he was nervous; Life had finally come true for him, but his excitement was fearless. As he walked in the opposite direction, I saw the world loosen its grip on him, and his whole body become like the flesh of a man.   I walk through this place the way my friend Mr. Pearl did. I must treat it like a dream, for it has no true reason. I search for you, and though I realize that I cannot bring back the memory of who you are, I will know you by the world in which you have enveloped yourself. If you are willing, I will guide you to a place where there is land below us and Time ahead. It is a meager share of what once was, but it is very real.

      I was in a good mood today, so I wrote a poem. When you read my poem, please read it backwards.  (Actually, more oppisite than backwards. It still reads from the top.) I wrote it that way on purpose.  It needs work. The rhythm is off.

      A Poem  Rain pours down in blankets. The sky is utter blackness Behind the darkened clouds I would see only more black masses My body facing skyward, Behind, the bed of fall Alone. Does darkness take me? Alone, and that is all.  Alas, so the sun hides and the rain shrouds my eyes And I see another shadow  Charging onward in the skies And I hear not a whisper but a moaning in the the trees.  Is this the superfluous call that death makes to his seized?  Alas, so the waning of night approaches And I still see not the light of day.  Alas, alas!  So there is crying in the distance And spittle on the breaking light of day!  Do I brave to call upon hope? A fatuous prangster!  Do I chance to speak the tongue of love? I refuse such an answer!  Weigh the mammoth revelations of a truth,  Or a purpose to this rough perseity And never brave to gaze above The sight of mine own eyes Or ponder on the of thought deity?  Live beneath this darkness,  For it is fruitless and it will not hurt my eyes! And searching ever upward For those ever luming  Omens in the skies!  Live this way and fight Not for love, for hope, for anything  for which we fight in foolish pride  in thinking we will win. Live beneath this darkness And do not hope or search or love And never life  be toilsome again.

      Since it was Valentine's day, I decided to look back at my blogs, and see which one I loved the most. (A person must love what she does, for it is a part of her.) I found a very short, angry one. I thought, poor little dejected blog. This one will be my friend. I will pay tribute to it.   It was the one about the man that said, "Remember when your mother said everything would be okay? She was wrong."   I asked my friend Reggie if he thought it wasn't possible for everything to be okay all at once.   Reggie, who is always one step ahead, replied "Maybe for a very short time -- Just a brief moment in which all of the world's troubles would cease simultaneously, all of the uglies would turn pink and gold, and everyone would suddenly be reminded of a good thing all at the same time. In an instant, I suppose a baby would be hungry and start crying, or a dam would break, or snow would fall on the head of a weary bird, but for a moment everything would be okay."  My friend Reggie thinks about these things. He is that type. We decided that it was possible but that it hadn't happened in quite some time, and probably wouldn't ever happen again.   Because I suspected that he had the idea before I did, I stepped on his foot. Then he had the gall to ask me why.  "Well," I felt obligated to speak honestly, "I imagine it's because I don't have everything I want, and I blame you because it is rather easy to do."   "If you had everything you wanted," he asked, "What would you do? Suppose you had the very best thing in the world and it was all yours? Do you think you would be happy then?"   It's hard to tell whatever he means at any given time, because none of his questions are ever really questions. Still, I tried to think of what it would mean to have the best thing in the world in my possession, but I could think of was a piece of white bread squished around a potato chip.   "There aren't many things better than that," said Reggie. I think he meant it.   I thought to myself, if that really is the best thing in the world at any given moment, then it is only the best thing to the one person who has it, and not to anyone else, with the exception of people who like to see others enjoy themselves. On the other hand, there are millions of things, such as mince, that are much better. At that moment, it seemed like the best thing in the world really was in my possession, and that it was not a thing but a fact: that if I have something that I think is wonderful, it is not only entirely possible but completely inevitable that there will be something else in the world that is even better, and if there are many, many great things in the world, then I shouldn't ever want everything to be okay, for that would mean a plague of mediocrity upon this world.   I told Reggie this, and he agreed, but he also added, "Then if you ever meet your worst nightmare, does that mean that there is much worse in this world respectively?"  "Naturally," I told him, "That is the dark evil of this world. It can't be brought to equilibrium, or else we would lose all of our mince, and all of our pieces of white bread squished around wavy potato chips."  "But one can be had without the other. You can have your bread and chips without stepping on my foot."  "Oh. Oh my."  Now I must rethink the whole world, you see.

      I feel so good today that I will make a second effort to tell you the story about my toads.   When I was a child, which was over ten years ago, I discovered a scrap pile behind a house in the country. It wasn't often that I visited the country, and I don't know how likely it is that I would have found such a scrap pile had it been a different occasion, but I just happened to be lucky enough that day. This was, by far, the best kind of luck a child can have, for in and about this old retired assemblage were hundreds of itty bitty toads, no bigger than the end of my thumb, making themselves at home.   I suppose I was rather a selfish child, and it was not in my nature to simply let them be. I caught five of them, and put them in a jar to take home with me. To my credit, I did not put on a lid.  At home, I made them a house out of a discarded pail. It was a Halloween pail, the kind that is made to look like a pumpkin, and I offered every commodity I imagined five toads could need. The bottom of a paper cup filled with water supplied them with a recreation as well as something to quench their thirst. A twig from my crabapple tree provided shade, and it's fruit, I hoped, would attract bugs for their dinner each night. Yes, there was a whole tree of fruit for the ants and their cousins to enjoy, but hope flies where logic falters, and I truly I operated under the best of intentions.  I named my toads. Their names were Periwinkle, Rudolph, George, Squeak, and Monkey. Periwinkle was named for the blue circles around his eyes, Rudolph for the famous reindeer. George was a very down to earth toad, and needed a sturdy sounding name. Squeak was very noisy, and Monkey, he was named for the shape of his face. He did not look like the other toads, but was more... I can only describe it as "squashy" looking. His face was flatter, and his mouth wider. One day I picked him up and found that his jaw was broken, and the bone protruded from his face and poked into his abdomen.   I kept my toads for almost a week. Each morning I would go out to check on them in their pail under the crabapple tree, and each morning they would be on the outside of the pail, dancing around like a bunch of tiny magic folk, or little demons around a fire. I'd scoop them all up one by one and put them back in their house, but I always felt guilty each time. I knew that there was something better for them out there, and they knew it too. Worse yet, the had the power to escape completely, but never did. Toads will be like that. Toads are very odd that way.  I decided that the only possible retribution for their situation was for me to take them to a place that was much more beautiful than my back yard and set them free. I decided to take them to my family's annual picnic, where I would reintroduce them to the free world.   Only Monkey, who I was afraid for, would not go. It seemed as though he might not have lasted the three days it would be until the picnic, and I decided to give him an early leave. He made peace with the world in my back yard. Two days after his release, I found an owl pellet that reminded me very much of Monkey.  The others, I took with me to the park. When I got there, many of my younger cousins, who were actually the children of my older cousins, were very excited to see my pets, but I told them that the purpose of their excursion was to find a home in the park. One of my cousins, who was actually the daughter of the wife of my older cousin, held Squeak very tightly in the palm of her hand so that I had to tell her to be much more careful, and open her hand when there was a toad inside it. She opened her hand, and Squeak had spit out all of his insides, but just as soon as she relinquished her hold, he swallowed them up again, and was as good as new. This is a very strange thing that I would not believe toads could do if I hadn't seen it for myself.  After setting all four of my captives loose under a large maple tree, I went about making myself a plate of chips, hot dogs, and all kinds of other picnic delicacies. About an hour later, I went back to the tree, and saw that one toad, Rudolph, still remained. I knew him right away, because he had a slender body and a brownish tone to his skin, and I thought  Who knew that Rudolph would have been the one who loved me the most.   Then my cousin, who I believe is really my cousin once removed, suggested that we bury him in the sand underneath the swing set. At the time, it seemed like a mighty good idea, to test the driving will of a toad in such a manner. In retrospect, it does not seem anything short of cruel, but at least I can rest knowing that he was a strong toad indeed, and so we were not able to keep him buried beneath the sand.  I do not know if this story serves as a better lesson to me, or to toads everywhere. If it is for me, then I suppose I should have to think about it a few more times. Otherwise, I hope that the toads who can read are kind and wise enough to share their findings with the rest of toadkind.   If you are going to leave the pail, leave the pail. If you have left the pail, do not stand under the tree.

      I am feeling much better at this hour. I have nowhere to go and nothing to do today. Of course, if I were a good girl, I would not have missed church, but I had church in bed this morning. It goes like this: I say my morning prayers, and then sleep for another hour, and when I wake up, everyone else is on there way home from church.   The church I used to go to was made of pink angel food cake. We used to rub up against the walls when we went inside, just to feel how soft it was, and smell it. I used to pick little pieces off too, and shove them into my mouth, but when my mom caught me, she would scold me.  "This building has to last a few more years," she'd say, "And it's not going to if little girls go nibble nibble all over it all the time."  Well, it did last a few more years, but not much longer. The birds got to it, but even if it weren't for them, there was the rain. It went stale, and then it just dissolved in the rain, little by little. It was being destroyed from two angles. It was being destroyed from the outside in, and from the inside out. The nibble marks on the inside became more conspicuous first (most of them were not mine.) and then everyone ceased their nibbling, for there began to appear green spots of fuzz, and the whole thing was crumbling inwards.   That church is not there any more, but there is another one to take its place. This new one is made of biscotti, and we suspect it will last much longer.

      I rust. I am getting all rusty. My fingers rusted. I have to oil them. My legs rusted. they became stiff and I have to clean them and make them work. My head rusted. It wouldn't come off, and I had to pry it for hours. Then is popped off, and I oiled it, and put it back on. I do this all by myself every so often, but I am not like the tin man. I sleep, and I am not made of tin, or a man.

      Today is April Fools Eve. I want to write about something, but I'm not sure what. I haven't been to interesting in a while, and I want to prove myself, but I am really very sick and not thinking to clearly. I would to a stream of consiousness, but then the government would read my blog and find out what I am thinking. Just kidding. They have radio waves for that. They don't have to read my blog at all. Just kidding. It's all a farce. The government doesn't worry about little nothings like me.   I'm very sick. I'm so sick that I blew on a flower and it died. I'm so sick that I gave money to a sales clerk and it turned to ashes in his hands. I'm so sick that stepped under the sun and it went right though me like I was a magnifying glass. I am very, very sick.  I have bronchitis and larengitis and sinusitis. I have the terrible jitters. I have a jumpy heart, and a goosey body. My skeloten is melting. My blood is changing all rainbow colors. My arms are getting longer and skinnier. So are my legs. My head is turning small and round like a grape fruit. I am transforming into a strange creature.  I am growing a tail. It isn't the one I had planned on. There are scales on my body. I have gills. I am breathing underwater, and then I am coughing for breath and the gills have vanished. I hear people around me. What are they saying?   They are saying, "Look at Mulya. She is sick. It must have been something she ate, or didn't eat. She hasn't slept in days."  I  am  sick.   I looked in the mirror five minutes ago, and I was pink and healthy, and slightly arrogent, and then I looked at myself again five minutes later. I was listless and piqued. I  had to beg everyone else for help. They didn't believe me, and now I have turned into this strange, scaley creature, and now they all want to come and help, but it is much too late. I will be this way forever. My arms are as long as my legs, and my legs are as long as a red cloak, which is longer than legs should be, and now my tail fell off, and I am turning into a spider.  Oh, I turned into a spider. All this time, I was going to doctors and taking medicine. I was worried about my heart, worried about my lungs. I was terribly, terribly worried, and all this time, I was only turning into a spider. If only I had known! If I had known that what I thought was illness all of this time was merely a benign conversion into the arachnid kingdom, I never would have worried my dear sensitive mind so!  All of the money I spent, the dealings on telephones with bearocratic insurance agencies and impervious middlemen -- vanity! I was so afraid, so many times, thinking that I had some horrific disease that could only be cured with expensive drugs and extensive therapies... The trouble I would have saved myself, if I had known the signs, that I was, and always had been, predisposed to this harmless medomorphisis, which will cause me to live out the rest of my days weaving webs from my own fluids, catching live prey, and dodging dust-mops in the corner of a dank, old cottage, or a neglected attic.  Ah, the lessons we learn. My enemies will be my companions, for they shall be the ones who taunt me and brag that they cannot be cought. Everyone will hate me. My music will not be melodic as it once was. It will be the creeks and groans of old wood, and rain sliding down a tin roof. Somehow this will all make sense to me, and I will live contently in my corner.  I have eight eyes now. I can see behind, ahead, and beside. I have a leg for each eye. Life is interesting -- not small as you would expect. Nothing you say or do can surprise me. I can curl my body into a very small, round, ugly, brown lump. I can hang out on the doorknob and keep you captive until you find a magazine. If I should ever die any way other than naturally, I think i would prefer to be eaten by a snake. It seems, somehow, more noble than a demise beneath a piece of paper.

      I went on a trip, and while I was there, I was told to write a song about heros. I was supposed to sing the song, but I couldn't, because my voice was gone, but at least I wrote one. It was hard, because I don't ussually write things because someone tells me to, but this time I did. The song went like this:  Bring me a hero Bring me a hero Bring me a maiden in torn rags Bring me a tattered man  Show me beauty Real beauty Give me no jeweled crown but show me a callosed hand  My hero is one Whose name you've never heard His name is an unspoken word He does not care  for money or fame But kindness is his sword  End  I think that as a poem, it lacks, but as a song, with the words all drawn out, because it's one of those songs, where the words get all drawn out in steps, it is not so bad, and it's kind of hoaky, but its true. The people I was going to sing it to would have liked it, but the other people, who I did not like, would have hated it. It would have served very useful in this way, but like I said, I could not sing it, so I just hid from all of them. I fell asleep on the table in a tavern that was actually not a tavern at all, and when I woke up it was too late to sing anything, and we all went to bed -- my friends, my enemies, and myself. The next morning it was all over, and time to go home, which I was ready for. The first thing i did when I got home was to take apart that time machine and throw it away.

      It occurred to me today that part of the manual says that all of your atoms change at once, and part of it says that they change in groups. i think that it is correct that they change in groups very quickly so that it seems like they have been changed all at once, because that's further on in the book and it makes more sense, but the over view says  Your atoms should appear to change simultaneously , and the cover says, "automatically switches protons and electrons in simultaneous fashion." That's where I got the idea that it happens all at once, but obviously the designers or the copywriters came up with that phrase, so that is not the part to really pay attention too. (but it is a very flashy package design.)

      I went into the future to see if I still hate pink in seven years.   "I know why you're here," I said when I arrived, "You want to see if I still hate pink."  "Yes," I answered, happy that I knew who I was, "I'm so glad you remembered."  "That's fine," I replied, "But I want you to know that every time you get into that machine, it takes one and a half of a nanosecond off your life. Three fourths one way, and three fourths going back, weather you're traveling to the moon, or seven years into the future to see if you like pink."  "How did you find that out?" I asked.  "That's easy," I said, "I just told me."  "Oh." I began to think I was a little weird.   I ran my fingers idly through my hair and continued, "When you change into negitive matter, you dissappear. When you get out of the machine, all of those little negitive atoms disperse. They fly around for a while, and then meet up with their opposite counter-parts, and the two cancel each other out."  "I don't reemmber that happening," I said, confused.  "Of course you don't," answered the older me, "Your past you meets up with your future you, and as your past and present brains connect, your mind is able to gloss over the fact that it just missed out on three fourths of a nanosecond."   Well, that's not so bad,  I thought,  Three fourths of a nanosecond can't be very long, to see if I still hate pink in seven years, but I knew exactly what I was thinking. I always had a good memory that way.  "Well, it's ruining everything," said me, "It's making trillions of atoms disappear from the universe, and they never get replaced."  "But we have -- "  "I know what you're about to say!," I interupted, "But we have plenty more! Yes, we have lot's of atoms, all kind of them, and one little person's worth isn't going to make that much of a difference, but it's altering the actual constructs of the universe! That can't possibly be good!" With that I began to walk towards me and put my hands out.  "Now shoo, me!" I said, "Get back in your pod and go home."  I was abashed again. Something always comes along and abashes me just when I'm having the greatest time.   "But what about the pyramids?" It struck me that I hadn't seen them at all.  "You can see the pyramids in the twenty-first century!" I was scooting me along now, trying to find a vortex or something to hurry me into.  I hollered, "But I want to see them  before !" but it was useless. I would hear nothing of it, and sent me straight home without even hugging me 'good bye'. What's more, I never got to find out if I hated the color pink.  On the way back, I got stuck in an alternate dimension for twenty years, but that is a different story.

      I know I said that I was doing things on purpose to make myself mad earlier, and then I said that I was talking to myself nervously, without ever introducing myself. Now, you may be thinking,  which was it? Did you talk nervously, or did you do things to make yourself mad?  Well, the truth is, I was kind of nervous, and so, to make myself not seem so nervous, I kind of started acting like a jerk. I was used to people acting like jerks though, so it didn't phase me much. I pretty much just looked at me and said, "Who are you?" but it wasn't the kind of "who are you" people ask when they want to know who you are. It was the kind of "who are you" that is usually followed by "to say that?" or "to be acting that way?"  This leads me to believe that I actually knew I was me the whole time. I was probably just messing with me, which, frankly, I think was pretty nervy, not to mention completely disrespectful of one's elders. I mean, started to think I was a real punk when I was a kid.  Anyway, I asked myself, "What makes you think that I'm not you, just because I look like you and I'm wearing your cloths? Is it so unbelievable to think that you might have a  lot in common with your future self?"  "Only the cool stuff," I answered, "Like this psychedelic music and this wicked purple jacket and white gloves."  "I got sick of that jacket and those white gloves, which means you will too, and that music sucks. Do you even know who Ivie Anderson is? Of course you don't. She died before you were even born." I was seething. How could I have been such an uncool teenager?  "Okay, prove it." I challenged me, "If you're me, who is the coolest mouse in the world?"  "That's easy. Danger Mouse is the coolest mouse in the world."  "Okay," I said. I seemed to be loosening up, but I still didn't believe me. "That was too easy. If you're me, what's your name?"  "Mulya," I said, "Duh."  "No way. That's a horrible name! My name is Penelope." Wow. I had forgotten that my name was Penelope.   "Okay, Penelope, that's great, but trust me. You'll get tired of things. You'll get tired of Penelope too. Mulya means hitting a tree with a stick to make the acorns fall out. I think you'll like that very much later on."  "How can you tell?" Penelope asked earnestly.   "because I'm you," I said, but I could tell I didn't really believe it completely. I told me to watch Penny Serenade, and that would change my mind really quick.   "People named Penelope fall out of rafters," I gently informed myself. Then I sat down, and while I was very tempted to tell myself all about the future, about the guys I would date, the education I got, and the people I met, I knew that those were things I wouldn't know until they happened. I also decided, much to my surprise, not to become a prophet of doom, so I didn't tell myself about the attacks on the world trade center, or the pentagon, or any of the social upheavals in various places in the world.   Instead I said, "Forest green would be a good color for these walls." That's when I felt a connection with my younger self.  "How old are you?," asked Penelope.  "Almost twenty-three," I said.   "That's not a long way a way. I'm glad I still hate pink in seven years."  At that point, I thought it would be a good idea for me to leave. I started to wonder if I would still hate pink in seven more years, and thought  I wonder if it would be wasteful to use this extraordinary machine that could be taking me anywhere in time, in any point in history, to any location in the world, to see if I still hate pink in seven years, which is actually fourteen years from where I am right now.  I decided that it couldn't hurt anything.

      I forgot to mention that when I stepped into my time pod yesterday that I read a little something about how it worked that terrified me, but as soon as I was too frightened to go through with it, it was over. The instructions booklet said that I would go through an electromagnetic conductor in order to transform all my electrons into positrons, and my protons into electrons. It was kind of like popping the plastic packing bubbles that the machine came in, and then unpopping them in another dimension. That's a bad analogy. It was, essentially, popping my present self away from my past self like a bunch of little hooks being unhooked a few at a time, but at such a high speed that it seemed simultaneous. I thought, ugh, for about a nanomillisecond, I'll be all half and half, and look like I'm all filled with holes or something, and I was afraid it would hurt.  What I thought was, I guess it picks me up and moves me, so that I reconnect in another place and time, but this is not so at all. The machine itself has to weave in and out of time because it holds onto the user, and drags part of that person through a loop, kind of like pinching off a piece of a loaf of bread, but without actually changing the body structure. (It's like a quark, if I have the word right -- those little things in atoms that jump time. More energy than machinery.) Then it goes back in time and finds the person again (that's me) and redirects the body path, then connects the loose end to the pinch of a body, which is now set up to be pushed out of the loop and continue moving through time without growing. It's a funny thing, because I think it's all loose in time. I mean, it kind of forms a line, but it's just a temporary fix before it has to go back into the loop, and it keeps getting reused. It's kind of hard to explain right because I haven't read the whole manual, but I skimmed through all of the important parts.  Anyway, the idea of having my body pulled apart, even temporarily, and affixed to a piece of me, was kind of unnerving, but it wasn't like I would have any scars or anything. It was tearing me from the future part of my body, which is just like me in the present, only in a different nanogular hypercubic millimeter, or something. Like I say, I didn't read very far. Anyway, it felt really weird. If you've ever eaten salmon roe, you might know what I mean. That is, if you've ever rolled caviar across your tongue and the roof of your mouth, and felt it popping in your teeth and heard it in your jaws, apply that feeling to your whole body, and you have something similar to atomic posi/negative switching. Very odd indeed.  Anywho, like I said, I was going to visit myself, and then when I saw me there, I just kind of started talking nervously, without even introducing myself, and I was abashed to discover that I didn't even know who I was, and furthermore, when I told me that it was me, I didn't even believe me. That was a real disappointment, so I made up my mind to go visit other people.   Come to think of it, I think maybe I do remember running into myself a long time ago, and being kind of disappointed, like, "Come on, if you're me, what are you doing wearing my old cloths? I'm going to get rid of those cloths tomorrow." I never did get rid of those clothes though.

      Today I was traveling time; Not in the normal sense, mind you, but at warp speed, and in places and times that on my own, naturally, I would not be able to go. It's kind of a long story and involves a lot of bending and transforming from positive to negative matter, and back again, and is hard to do, and dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, because negative matter disappears when in contact with positive matter if it has time to, and that's why you have to be sure that you are already facing away from time when you do it: so that there won't be a moment in which things can radically change. The problem is that Time is so steady, nobody can really measure precise moments, but I measure it in nanogular hypercubic millimeters, which are satisfactorily monkey units. Anyway, You have to turn matter out far enough that it has time to leave time, but not time to do anything else, and if you're moving a person in and out of time, you have to make sure that all of their atoms change all at once, or else you have part of them in and part of them out, and it's even worse than that movie  The Fly , and I don't even want to think about that.   Anyway, the transformation is like breaking a cord, and then you can unwind it and bend it around, but not on your own, because if you live in the fourth dimension, then the fourth dimension controls your movement, which means that you have to do what I did and buy a machine that exists outside of time. Then you get these little tubes that poke through the fabric of Time, and they are called synthetic worm holes (SWH, or as I like to call them, tubes) and you get right inside this little pod, and turn this little knob, and it sucks you through this worm hole. It sucks in part of the machine when it does it too. It's a very powerful vortex, you see, but it spits the machine back out, and it sucks you up, as long as you aren't connected to the machine.   Then, for what seems like a moment in time, but is really not in time at all, you can't move or breath at all. This lasts for however long your mind lets it last, because your mind, you see, lingers about on the grey fringes of space-time all the time, and that's why you can't remember all of your dreams. If you could, you would go crazy because it is impossible to remember an eternity of information in finite confounds. However, when you are outside of time, you can think everything at once, and that is why is isn't so scary to not be breathing or moving, because you're mind is freer than your body. Later, we all get bodies that work outside of time, but even without them it's pretty cool, and it's not drug induced.  Anyhow, that's how it would work if you were in my time machine, which I bought at a flee market (It's a  Singular 3000 ) two days ago, and used to visit myself and some other people. It had been tampered with, but I don't think the owner ever figured out how to use it. I had a little bit of trouble myself, being slightly dyslexic and all, but the pictorial instructions were of great assistance to me, and so were the little red arrow stickers stuck to the shell of the pod, and the tubing.   I wondered if I would be able to see myself at all, as I have no memory of ever being visited by myself, and I thought it was worth a try. Maybe when the past gets changed, it goes it's own little route and fizzles into five or six dimensional space or something, while the original strain of time keeps going, or maybe all those changes go to the back of our memory, and that's why I wanted to visit myself: because my subconscious still remembered that I had been visited, even if I didn't.   Well, whatever happens, I did what I did. To start, I went back to the year 1997, and found myself sitting in my old pink room, listening to psychedelic music, eating coconut marshmallows and writing in my journal.  I asked, "What are you writing about?" forgetting to introduce myself (as if introductions were necessary) and I sat on the edge of my bed and peered over my shoulder to see.   "I'm writing about my past." said me.   "What in the world for? You hardly have any past at all!" I used to resent it when people said that to me. I guess it's not really healthy for a person to want to get a rise out of herself that way, but I was in a mood. I picked up the book and read allowed:  "I was born with a piece of candy in my mouth. It was a lifesaver, and to this day, I still won't eat the green ones."  "That's a very good story." I said to me, when I was finished, "I can't see where anyone wouldn't like your story."  "Who are you?" asked myself. I was abashed.  "I'm you!" I said, "Can't you tell?"  "No." answered myself, "You can't possibly be me. We look too much alike. When I'm your age, I'm not going to look anything like the way I do now."   I have to get off of the computer right now, but I will tell you all about what happened next time I am able to post a blog.

      When I was growing up I had a light that I wore on the top of my head And a tulip which I kept in the bottom drawer of my wooden chest and I had a nightstand  with a picture of an invisible (Invisibles are a lot like ghosts only they don't have spirits), and I had a locket  with a moonbeam inside it and a swivel  with a charm attached to the end. (Swivels are a lot like twirls only they don't make you as dizzy.)  I also had a grizzly bear named Peter.  He was very much like every other bear,  and often ate my lunch and frightened my relitives. I don't really miss him at all.  The things I miss most of all are often the ones I still have,  Like the walls.  Nobody thinks about walls much, and I sometimes forget they are there. I am glad when I realise I still have them but even so, I can't seem to shake the feeling that they will never come back.

      It's that time of night, so there isn't any use trying to think of things that are trying to think about me wanting to know what you think they might be, so I asked you to stop, but you didn't stop because you thought that you would find out, but you didn't find out, and now I am just telling you to forget about it so that you won't go on like this, but you can't forget about it because you've gone on like this for so long, and now everyone else wants to know too. See? You shouldn't have promised them anything. Now they're all waiting at your front door, and you're thinking about them and watching them and hoping that they will go away, but they aren't going to go away until you tell them what, and you won't know what until I tell you, and I'll never tell you because I don't know what, because its not my job.We went walking and you still had to keep an eye on your front door, and they were all setting up tents, so you left out the back because I told you that would be a good idea, and now you're trying to figure it all out from me, but see, i already told you: I didn't know. Now I'm trying to figure out something about you. Why can I see through you? Just because you are tranluscent blue and made of water, and I'm not blind, doesn't mean that i should be able to look right through you, or maybe it does. Like I said before, I don't know. Then we go back and I begin to wonder why I always have to do everything in present tense. Well if you wan tto tell them, then go right ahead, if you think I'm lying to you and actually i do know the thing and I have just been refusing to tell you, and no, I don't think that you look good in that dress because it belongs to me. I saw a man wearing a black mini-skirt and a pink baby-tee today, and he smiled at me, and I thought it was much too cold for him to be wearing an outfit like that and that if he wanted to dress like a woman he could take a tip from me and buy a sweater and some jeans. I am a woman after all, even when I'm covered from head to toe in cotton knits and knotted in my red wool scarf. It was cold today, so when a man in a dress shook his hips and flicked his wrist at me with a smile, I just wanted to tell him to put more cloths on. i think he thought I was boy. I've never looked like a man, but I've often looked like a boy when I was bundled up tight. I thought about being knitted rigth into a knitting, and being part of a scarf or a jacket instead of just wrapping it around me. I also thought about making things hard to read, because that's kind of like being in a knit. Its like counting strands of fiber that have been knitted togather. There, you see? I told you. People are always asking why. Now I understand why thy do that because I was looking through you, and now I see why you want to know the answer when you look at something. If this doesn't make a lot of sense it's because rabbit. The end.

      Reggie and I are sitting on my futon chair watching Penny Serenade. It is in black and white, which makes me feel sophisticated.   "What's this movie about?" asks Reggie.   "Its about a couple who gets a little girl," I say, "but then she dies, so they get a new one."  "You can't replace a little girl," says Reggie contemplatively.   "No," I agree, "You probably can't," but now I feel less high society so I knee him in the ribs. Reggie takes the blow, then he looks around for something to irritate me with. He picks up a white, wooden box. It's my box that I've had since I was a kid, and I always liked it because there is a picture of a girl on the lid who looks like me. There is a boy too, holding the girl's hand, and he looks like a boy I used to know. Billy was his name. He was my first boyfriend, when I was twelve years old.  "What's in the box?" asks Reggie.   "Nothing." I tell him.   He taunts me, "Tell me what's in the box."  "No."  "Tell me what's in the box, or I'll tickle your knees."  "No!" I say, "Okay," and I open the box.  The inside of the box is pink satin with a triangular mirror on the bottom of the lid, but when I open it, I don't see a mirror. I see my face, because I am in that box.   It's filled with papers that look insignificant. The first one, on the top, is a sketch of a girl with horns, that has been outlined with a black permanent marker. Beneath the girl is a name, and beneath that is the phrase, "good fortune." She is my other alter ego.  Next is an orange paper that reads, "Actors theater of Louisville EMPTY SEAT PASS." It is from the time I didn't go on a date, but ended up having a coke and a good conversation after the play. There is a playing card, a king of diamonds with my name on it,  that a magician gave me. We used to talk on the phone. There is a paper with some poems that I wrote during algebra class in my first year of high school:   "Put down that gun!" I said to the nun, but never did she listen. She blew off my head,  and now I am dead. Boy! She's been practicin'!   My teacher was a nun. No wonder I had to take algebra twice.  There is a "magic" card, a letter to God, and the remains of a burnt paper cup that nobody else knows I have. My friends and I once had a fake saonce in front of the church, and as the pastor walked by he said, "Be careful kids." We should have been formally shooed from the premise, or maybe dragged home to our parents by the ears, but nobody had time, and anyway, at least a third of us grew up into well adjusted adults, and I got a burnt paper cup out of it.   There are several notes from the brooding poet I dated in highschool, a couple from the other boys I liked, and a picture of a monster by my friend Erin, entitled, "Fangtallor Antenna-Head." There is also the moon in my box. Someone once gave me the moon, and I have it still, and if you don't believe me, ask Reggie. He is looking at it now. It is the size of a penny, but thinner and lighter, and it is silver. Whatever is in the sky now must be what they use to replace the moon whenever it gets stolen.  Reggie turns the moon over in his fingers, and I dig through more papers. It is amazing how much I was able to fit in this tiny little box. There is a painted rock from my aunt.    She gave it to me at the time when the average rock filled up my whole fist, and she said, "A rock is the best kind of pet to have. You can wake up in the morning and smile at it, and it just smiles right back." Of course, it's face was painted there, but it was true all the same. I named him Roch, which, in German, means "glory."  I find cards with pictures of Jesus and Mary from Catholic funerals, a receipt from a boutonniere that dates back to before grocery stores had "plus" cards, a silver dollar certificate, and a note with a phone number from a man named Eugene who wants me to call him any day of the week after 5:00. I wonder if the offer still stands.  I also find a note from Billy, the one who looks like the boy in the lid of my box.   A picture of an eye, A picture of a heart, and the letter "U": It is written in pink. On the inside of the note is an invitation to his band recital, but I just realized that. It says that he is having one, and until this moment, it never occurred to me that he was telling me because he wanted me to go. I went to a dance with Billy once, and he had skinny shoulders. I read the note twice, and then put it back in the box. I have to save this one, because Billy is dead.  "Reggie," I say, "God-machine, give me back the moon. I'm putting my box away." He gives it back to me. I slip it in between an old memory and a ghost. As I close the box, I notice that the hinges are broken. I think about the humanity of my box and imagine people crying at my wedding some day.   I have a silent thought, but I finish it aloud, for ol' Reggie's benifit.   "Actually Reggie," I start, "If you really must know, all little girls get replaced, but sometimes they leave behind white, wooden boxes."

      Too tired to write tonight. Can't complete a thought. Stayed up thinking, and now my brain is wrought.  Can't sleep either. Rest just doesn't come. Like an intricate equation with an unaccounted sum.  I keep thinking of things that make no sense,  They seem ridiculous and yet, they seem of consequence.  must sleep now the end

      It's one of those days where I just don't know.  I got tired of everything, and wrapped myself up in a little cocoon and went to sleep, but while I was sleeping, I had a dream. I dreamed I had a visitor who asked me what I was trying to do.   "I wrapped myself up in silk," I said, "and when I awake, I will be a beautiful butterfly."  "You will not," said the being, "You will become a moth. Butterflies come out of crysallises."  I was abashed. I did not want to be a moth. Nobody ever thinks of moths as magical or cheerful. I have never seen a moth on a "get well" card, or a decorative wall hanging. Butterflies, on the other hand, are practically worshiped. They are everywhere: on cards, in photos, on calendars, and nobody wants to kill a butterfly. They are so colorful and attractive. People just want to build gardens for them and watch them from the back window. I asked if there was anything I could do to change my fate.  "Of course," answered my visitor, "That's why I'm here. I don't go about showing up in people's dreams with no purpose, you know." He seemed a little offended that I had asked, which sort of made me feel guilty, but I didn't say anything. He waved his hands over me and then vanished into the air the same way I imagine a cream puff would vanish if it was shoved into a bottle of soda pop.  When I woke up, I was a butterfly. I just knew it.  I ran to the closest mirror, which was leaning against the wall in my bedroom.  Look at me,  I thought, grinning madly. I looked at my face. I saw two shiny blue eyes. I twisted around my head and observed my back.  My wings must be invisible.    To the untrained eye, I hadn't changed a bit, but I could tell that I was a butterfly. I felt lighter and had an overwhelming urge to spend the rest of my life outside. I ran into the neighbors' garden, and sucked the nectar from their flowers. They were watching me! They even took pictures. I saw a man chasing butterflies with a net.  "Come and get me!" I teased. He could not keep me restrained. I even flew into his net, but he got flustered and pulled it away.  "Stay out of my net!" he said.  "Suit yourself," I called back as I flew away.   I saw a painter standing in the park, painting flowers on a huge canvas. He was studying an assortment of flowers, and there were butterflies flying around them in curvy little lines.   "Oo, let me join!" I exclaimed as I tattered towards them, and landed delicately on a rose petal. The man began cursing and threw down his brushes.    Well, that's mighty peculiar behavior for a man,  I thought, but then I remembered that he was an artist, and they are apt to be flighty at times. Besides, I do not concern myself with the conduct of people anymore... now that I am a butterfly.

      I was thinking about that tree-person story from back in October, and I thought, maybe the tree person doesn't stay in the tree after all. Maybe she climbs down from the tree one day, and looks up at the two creatures, and sees that they are just perfectly fine without her, and then, maybe the two creatures feel unsettled all of a sudden, because something got changed, and they both get up to move to different trees.   The pink one, see, it would go first, up into a higher tree, and then the blue one would decide that it preferred a lower tree, and it would move too. Then, the tree person, she wouldn't be to certain of what kind of tree she wanted. Maybe a gnarled up one, or a big fat one, you know the kind of tree that looks like it ought to be able to talk about things, but can't because it's just a tree.  Well, anyway, maybe then she'd look up again, and think about those two creatures, and she'd be kind of sad, but even more happy, because like I said before, she'd been given a chance, and that would be enough for her. Plus, she would realize that she'd been given the opportunity to make a decision, and that she had taken it, and that would be the moral of the story. It would be all about choices, and how, just because you live in a tree, it doesn't mean you have to stay there, even if you thought for a long time that you belonged there.

      1. I said to myself, how can I just keep going like this?" and it occured to me that i was on a train, and I had to keep going that way, because trains can't be turned around.   2. She was in a cozy hammock which fit snuggly to her plump body. It looked comfortable, except that she was roasted, and a chicken.   3. I came home from work last night, and there was a man standing behind the door in my bedroom.   I said, "Man, why are you standing there? Do you know where you are?" and he shook his head.  "You're in my room!" I exclaimed, "A woman's room, and what's more, I am a stranger! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?"  Again, he shook his head, and then, as if this were not insulting enough, he blew in my hair -- an act of sheer incolence, if you ask me!  I proceeded to scold him, "How dare you be so cavalier! Didn't your mother ever teach you manners? What a world we're coming to, where a man can just traipse into a woman's room and assume he will go unnoticed!"  Once again, the man shook his head, this time as if agreeing with me in the same disenchantment with the shameful state of this world.  I said to him, "Who are you to act so  blase  all of a sudden? You're the reason it's become this way!"  At that, he blew on me again, and shook his head some more. Suddenly I felt sorry for the man. As I stepped back to get a good look at him, I noticed that he was very thin, and at least a foot shorter than myself. He also had a very big head, and was, over all, quite malformed. Perhaps he was merely looking for acceptance, and in his search came upon a home. Perhaps there was something warm about this home, something inviting that made him feel as though someime inside must feel the same as he did. Someone inside would be understanding. I realised that during our whole conversation, he had not said one word.   "Can't you talk," I said. He shook his head 'no.'  "How awful." My heart went out to him. I told him that he could stay a while until we found a better place for him. I didn't think that this was too harsh, as a guest cannot expect to find perminent lodging among perfect strangers. I did, however, request that he stay in a different room, as it was not proper for a man and woman who were not married to be staying together in one room, but he disagreed, and blew in my face again.   "Now see here!," I fussed, "That is a very rude gesture which I do not appreciate! If you keep doing that, I shall have to ask you to leave at once!" Again, he blew in my face, desheveling my hair-do.  I attempted to lead him towards the doorway, but it was at this time that I noticed he had tied himself to the wall! I could not imagine what would have driven him to do such a thing. I informed him that if he did not untie himself and leave at once, I would call the police, but when I thought about what he may have already been through, I could not bring myself to do it.  I resolved to bring him to Reggie's attention, and ask what he thought might be done with the man.   Reggie, patting me on the back, chuckled in his assuring way, and apoligized.  "For," said he, "It is I who invited this man to stay. I thought that he would find this place and you hospitable, and I suggested that he tie himself to the wall in case a strong draft occured. One can never be too careful."  "It is drafty in here, " I agreed, and that is how I came to let this man stay in my room, but I still don't think it's quite proper, and no matter how many times I have asked him, he will not desist his shaking and blowing around. If it is a new exercise program of his, I would very much like to know about it.

      "The difference between a writer and an author," said the little girl to the librarian, "is that authors are published and writers are not."  "That's right," added the young woman on the other side of the counter, "And what do writers do for a living? Why, they work at grocery stores."

      if a mouse is squatting in the middle of the floor the way mice do sometimes there are several things that you can do.  You can leave it, but then you will have a mouse in your house, and mice are germy, and they make more mice, and scare your company.   you could catch it. they are hard to catch, but you could catch it, and put it in a jar, and take it to the park and set it free. The there would be a mouse in the park, but I don't think that hurts anyone.   You could set a trap, or poison it, or kill it in some way. It seems cruel, but what's a mouse doing in your house anyway? Probably trying to eat your food, and chew on your walls. Maybe even thinking about making more mice.  the point is, there are a lot of mice, squatting in a lot of kitchens, but it's the middle of the night, and most of them are safe until morning, and I think that if I were a mouse, I would probably be doing the same thing. i don't know about you.

      Oh, hello. I am bored, but i don't feel like blogging, but I have to, because otherwise my blog will stagnate. Maybe it's a good thing to write while I don't feel like it. I'll do a stream of conciousness. I'll complain a lot, starting now. I'm really mad about that cow. She was an elephant. I'm really mad at her for sitting on me today. I think it was rude. There was a chair, but she refused to use it. Ussually, elephants are much more considerate. i looked her up in the old records and discovered that she had never been to elephant charm school. I found her yearbook and noticed than only two people had signed it, but they had signed it over and over in different handwriting. one of them was her. the other was a grape. I didn't even think grapes had arms, but how else could it have signed her yearbook?  I don't think that most moths are inherantly evil, but I do know at least one or two who are. Maybe it has something to do with the air, or the types of cloths they ate when they were young. Maybe moths who eat silk turn out nice, but moths who eat old sweaters and torn up jeans turn mean and pickled. I think pickled is a good word to describe someone who is sour. I dislike pickles, but I don't hate them. I don't like pickled people at all. I simply detest pickled moths.   When I used to say I despised people when i was little, it wasn't because I was trying to be nice and not say the word hate, like a lot of people think. it was because hate just didn't seem hateful enough. I was never as pickled as a pickled moth though. oh, i forgot to complain. I'm sick again. I'm very sick, and I think I'm turning into a horrible creature again, only this time, I think that I'm going to have my head magnitized to the floor, so that i have to walk around up-side-down for the rest of my life. Maybe I'll even have to learn to eat up-side-down. How will I do that? I'll have to eat things that stick to me, like peanut butter, so they won't go the wrong way.  Maybe if I keep thinking, I'll think of something good. Maybe even as good as peanut butter, which I love. Last night I had a dream, in which I had the oppertunity to say, "But why would John F. Kennedy want to talk to you?"  I got lost in wonderland. it turned out that there is a door up in my attic that leads to wonderland. If you walk out it, you just go out to the roof, but when you walk back in, you go to wonderland. It's funny, because I thought that was just a made up place in a book, but it's not. It's right up there in my attic. i saw it last night.   Guess what. I've never done drugs in my life. So, if you think I did, you can stop thinking right now. I'll just have to stuff a sock in your brain if you think you can get away with thinking things like that. i don't even think I ever wanted to do drugs. my friends kept saying it would make me see weird things, and think interesting thoughts. i said, hell, can't i just sit down and read a book? No, you can't sit down and read a book. you have to imagine things. lots of things. you have to see paisly at night. I used to be visited by paisly. I hate paisly.  I guess after a while, paisly figured out that I hated it. because it stopped coming over to play. i wouldn't play with it anyway. Like I said, I despise paisly. you'll never catch me wearing it either. Here's another thing you should know: i have a dark secret that I am about to share with you. Here it goes: I've never seen a purple cow. There is a charicter in a book I'm writing who is named after the poet who wrote "The purple cow." There. Now you know. I feel better. Whew. A big heap has been lifted from my chest. thanks a lot.

      The other day at work, I broke some of the mechanical equipment. Actually, I didn't break it at all. Someone else did, but she didn't want to admit it, so for all practical purposes, I was the one to blame. This put me in a particularly good mood, being credited for something I very much wanted to do, without putting forth the extra effort of performing the deed myself, and I grew a mysterious smirk like the Mona Lisa's. I felt mysteriously happy, because it's rebellious to wink at the customers when the equipment is down, and being rebellious makes the heart inflate. It's a vicious circle.   To tell the truth, it had never occurred to me to damage machinery until it had already been done, but I figured if I were to be held responsible, I may as well take on a spiteful attitude towards the apparatus, and make the idea of a reprobate Mulya complete. This is the difference between a free concept and a criminal mind: The former, a victim of hearsay, and the latter, a brooding heart of malice, ready to pounce on any small piece of retail equipment that chances to cross her ill-beaten path. Bwa hahahaha! My laughter shakes the room like a snake shaking free from its skin.  From now on, I have decided, I shall travel in a smack, like a jellyfish. There is safety in numbers.

      I need to finish my story today.   The continuation of the happiest story in the world:  When we left you, Sara had been invited to the prom by Ted. Milli and Tommy didn't think that Sara could go to a prom, because she is a snail, but Sara was determined to prove them wrong, and decided to earn enough money for a dress by watching baby Mable while Mrs. Mable-mother was away. In our most recent development of the story, Sara got eaten by baby Mable. Well, I guess that just about sums it up. I was going to keep telling the story, but there doesn't appear to be anywhere else to go with it.  The End.

      Today I am going to write the most happy story in the world.   Begin:  The happiest day ever for Sara was the day Ted asked her to the prom. It was going to be in two months, and there was plenty of time to get ready.  "Okay," said Sara, "I need to get a dress, so I will have to work very hard and make enough money baby sitting for that, then I need to get some shoes and some panty hose, and maybe get my hair done."  Milli, her little sister, stood in the doorway listening to all of this and smiling.   "It's so exciting!" she said, "I can't wait until my prom! But Sara, how are you going to wear shoes and a dress when you just have one leg and it's slimy, and you live in a shell?"  Sara scorned, "You are the most pessimistic snail I know. Where there's a will there's a way. Now, why don't you get out of here?" and she pushed mud over the opening to her room.  The next day at school, Sara bragged to all of her friends.   "I am going to the prom," she said.  "Snails don't have proms," said her friend Tommy.  "Ted's school does."  Tommy frowned.  "But Ted doesn't want to go out with you. He's a person. People who take snails ot the prom never get laid."  "Oh posh," answered Sara, "Your just jealous because Ted doesn't want to take you to the prom."  The next day was one of Sara's baby-sitting days. She was going to be watching little Mable, who was two years old.  When she got there, Mrs. mable-mother warned her, "Mable is at that age where she likes to put things in her mouth. Watch her very carefully. You know how babies can be."  Sara watched Mable very carefully. Mable watched Sara too. She had seen her Uncle Pierre eating snails once and wondered what they were like. Mable walked over to Sara.  "Oh, you want to play patty cake?" asked Sara. Mable popped her in her mouth.  To be continued

      It got late; not as late as it sometimes is, but late enough that I forgot what I was going to talk about. There was a wonderful story in it. Oh well. Sometimes I stay up until my mind is falling over, and then I just do what I'm doing right now.  Last night I walked into a tower that had been built by me. It was made of yellow brick, and inside the walls were covered in words. I had written them. There was a pool hall on one floor, and I drove a red poniac. I used to drive a red Mercedes in my dreams. What happened? I must have wrecked it, but anyway, I like my poniac. It is a '75 convertible, but it is a model that has never been made before.   I left my tower because I was looking for my boyfriend, because I wanted to show him what a wicked pool hall I had with yellow bricks and poetry on the walls, and a great view of the outside, but he was busy, so I went out with my sisters. We caught a ride from a man who seemed nice enough, until he started spraying us all with window cleaner. He told me that he was doing it because I was selfish. He sprayed it in my sister's face, and she put her hands up to avoid it, but she was really upset that there was a crazy man near her. We were all afraid. I promised him I would clean the windows if he gave me the bottle, but he said it was too late.  I woke up, but I was still inside the dream. It was starting over again. I said to myself, Good, I'll do this the right way this time, and I started on my way. This time I saw the man on the way to my building. He was painting his black car orange.  I said, "what are you doing? Why are you doing that? You're not supposed to be here yet. I have to find my boyfriend and tell him he's not really busy, because it's my dream, and he needs to look at my building, but now you're in my way."  The man was angry with me. He said I was lazy and selfish because I wouldn't help him paint his car orange, so I picked up a brush and started painting the car.   He said, "what are you doing! You've gotten orange paint all over my nice black car!" and he started spraying me with window cleaner. I was tired of him, and I wanted to go see my building, but I couldn't find my red poniac. I woke up, and it was all that stupid guys fault.

      World Undone Chapter 1   Mr. Lucky's Cherry Cough Syrup. One teaspoon will calm your throat, two will make you glad, four will make you see nice things, and eight will drive you mad. Mr. Lucky's cherry cough syrup.    Someone had been talking to me, or singing. I could not remember, so I just kept humming to myself and walking east. I felt more at ease than ever before. It was as if my mind had been cleared of thoughts I never knew I had. I was surrounded by green grass on all sides and yet, although it was like any flat stretch of land, the feeling was unfamilier. I only knew that if I kept walking straight, then whereever I had come from would be right behind me, but there were no marks to prove that I had been walking forward all of this time. The foilage appeared untread, and as I gazed about me, I could detect no shadows; no signs that I was a part of these surroundings. The sun was in the sky, but it did not warm me, and niether did the wind come and chill my skin.   I don't know how long I went on this way  to be continued when I am less tired

      I have a new blog for writers like me, (writers who are not writers.) and other people who think that maybe they could not write some day. It was Reggie's idea, but he said that he did not want to participate because he is a writer, although he did give me a poem to share.  A poem, by Reggie  I         d o n   ot    thi ink    th atra tio give   tyousz a pl  enja   wiild    wil  l be    of  ushgshe     much    in   ter   e st to me or my    dhjdhd  fo   g.     go         c are    aboue   t      so     kjmoeone          el   se.   d   era        M   U   L   Y          fjhfjbff    A      gi  ve  me a a  c    chan   nece         pl  ea   se stop       ta    xin   wrfuh   ta x   t    akjhxi  ng    ta xing   mym     min nd.   The End.    There must have been a noise somewhere when he wrote it. I think that Reggie has an even harder time than I do thinking when there is a television in the room, or the next room, or somewhere in the house where it can be heard, and there is always a television on somewhere, usually in fairly close proximity, and if there's not a television then there is a radio, or an intercom, or somebody listening to a cd player with the sound up so high that a rythmic buzz resinates from his head, not his mouth, and rings in our ears even after he has left.  There's always a sound somewhere, and if its a pleasant sound, it's a pleasant sound that is covering up another sound, like perfume on an unbathed body. The thinking sound -- the sound a mind makes when it has formed an idea of a concept of a thought -- has no greater might than the faint click of a seed falling from a wilting flower and hitting the ground. Because thought has so much competition, we think that several heads may be better than one. Hense, Bee House.  Bee House, which I dedicated to the bees that are building the extra room on my house, is the new blog consisting of seven people who will dare to join. Also at blogspot.

      I spoke to my very good friend Reggie today.   We were standing out on the porch, having poached eggs, and I said, "Reggie, have you noticed anything different about me?"  "Yes, I have," he said, "You're a spider. You haven't ever been a spider before."  "I know," I was glad I didn't have to tell him, "Do you think I look better as a spider?"  "I don't know," said Reggie, "I never really paid attention to what you looked like before." He's always teasing me, but I know he pays attention, or else he wouldn't have noticed.  I asked him, "Do you think I'll stay this way?"  "Probably not," he said, "At least, I've never seen a person turn into a spider and then stay that way."  Reggie is always reassuring. I did kick him, but only a little bit this time, because I was so glad to have his support.

      True story: In a previous life (where I was still Mulya, because I really only have one life. I just keep living it over and over.) I died at the hands of a well known hero of the town, SuperEgoman. I was evil, and he was good. We exchanges e-mails for some time...  Dear Mulya, How happy I am to meet thine acquaintance. I find the experience quite pleasurable and hope that thou doest feel the same. Thy whilst write me, I hope, I implore thee.  -SuperEgoman   Dear SuperEgoman  Your flowery turn of phrase has me all melty inside. It inspires me to write poetry. O, mocking fish O mocking fish I hardly ever mock thee. I threw a fish  And made a wish. It turned the lake to sake.  -Mulya.   Dear Mulya,  A fish!!?? Why would thine write about a fish and not a dog, or a fluffely, fluffely kitten? Those are creatures worth writing about. Fish are slimy, and they eat worms.  -SuperEgoman  I don't like cats. I like fish. -Mulya  Dear Mulya,  I am shocked and chagrined. My heart is full of rage. My head is exploding with anger. You are a terrible person. You are a brainless flibbertygibbet, a mindless ninkumpoop, a wall-bumping bimbo, and an unthinkably thimblewitted moron. Everything about you is weak and insignificant. Write back, luvvy. -SuperEgoman  I, being a disgusting excuse for a person, did not write back, but the next day, he rightly confronted me.  S.E.M.: Why didn't you return my email?  Me: I didn't know what to say!  S.E.M.: Ha! Your powers of comprehension are too weak for my enormous brain-thoughts! I have rendered you speechless!  Me: You told me I was terrible and weak. I didn't feel like answering.  S.E.M.: How could you answer!? I slew your attempts with my uncanny wit!  Me: You're a narcissistic a**hole!  S.E.M.: Oooo! That's a big word! Try this one for size: Antidisestablishmentarianism. Ah ha! Your scathing yet accurate description of my character stands no chance against my twelve syllable vocabulary!  Me: Curses! You're right. Just standing in your presence is making my brain collapse! I am writhing in pain. Ah! I am convulsing! Ack! Cough, choke, I'm dying. Cough, choke, I die!  SuperEgoman strikes again, and Mulya (who is a little narcissistic herself) rediscovers the error of her ways. Go team.   (I dedicate my use of the word antidisestablishmentarianism to my oldest sister, who is particularly against unnecessary wastes of oxygen.)

      It has been three days of April, but I missed them. I was asleep. Well, this is only the beginning of the third. I suppose I should have plenty of time to bask in the earliness of April, but I will probably sleep instead. Someone is bringing me breakfast. Someone else said a little prayer for me. I have saturated my body in a deluge of self pity. In the next room is a potato patty with my name on it. Oh, wonder of wonders! I  love  potato patties.  I went to eat the potato patty, and it spoke to me.  "If you eat me," it said, "You'll be sorry for the rest of your life."  "I know," I replied (and this was as sincere), "I have no desire to find out what happens if I eat a talking potato patty." so I left it alone. I did start to eat the one that wasn't talking, but suddenly a dreadful idea made it's way to the forefront of my mind.  "Are you the only talking food in the world, or is all food just very shy?"  "Wouldn't you like to know," said the potato. He had a cruel since of humor, which is foolish for a character beneath as much power as he.  It fancied my palette to believe that such greasy morsels are not like cats, who only don't speak because they haven't the interest, but that the potato patty to my right side was a freak of nature. While I did not eat him, however, he did get eaten. You see, while house cats have trained themselves to favor dry, processed foods, the cats of the outdoors will only eat food that they can talk to. This is why it is so favorable for them to catch mice and birds, but they quickly found that it is just as well to have a conversation with a potato patty, so long as he will beg for his life in return. I tossed the little cockolorum in the front yard, where he was swiftly devoured. So much for repercussions.  I must admit, I did consider asking the rest of my food if any of it felt like speaking, but I was so afraid that it would, and I cannot express the guilt I would feel from partaking in personified biscuits and eggs. I fear that I would never eat again, but there is no use starving myself  when it can so easily be avoided.

      I couldn't write for a few days because I was floating around in space. Actually, I lie. I was still within the Earth's atmosphere, but I might as well have been in space, because it was just as lonely up there.   I had eaten a lot of sugar that day, even thought the doctor says it's bad for me. I can go a goodly while without indulging, but then I just splurge, and the terrible thing that happens is that my body gets very upset with me, and punishes me. Usually I get extremely nervous, and shaky, and my head starts to feel light, as if it would float away. That's why at first I really thought it was my head that was floating away, but, in fact, it was my whole body.  A few people tried to stop me by pulling at my legs, but I was afraid they would tear off my cloths, so I kicked them away. Then they tried tugging at my feet, but all that happened was that I lost my shoes, and then I just had cold feet, and I was still floating away, so it didn't do them a bit of good anyway.   I floated pretty far, but I didn't see that much, as I was terrified to look down for a long time. When I finally did gather enough courage to take a peek at what I was missing, I had already missed it, for there was nothing but sky below me.   I stayed that way for at least an hour before I started wondering if anyone was worried about me.  I doubt anyone is really worried about me  I thought, pouting, but there was no one there to see me pout, so it didn't do me any good. I decided I'd better write a note and make sure that someone out in the world would understand my dire situation, and possibly send up a helicopter so that I could be on television.   "To whomever this concerns," it stated, "This is Mulya. I just want you to know that I am floating several miles above you, and am quite all right. Please send food and media attention."  I crumpled the letter into a ball so that it would fall at a speedy rate, and tossed it over my shoulder for good luck. About six hours passed, and I floated another fifteen or so feet. Then, I felt something hit my back. It was a cicada, and it had landed squarely on my clean angora sweater.   "Get off my sweater," I said. I noticed that it was carrying a message in its mouth.  "srhifur iuffh eriu eufn heyy sdhd how yoiu ufr up there4." It was a letter from Reggie. I turned it over and wrote, "Turn off the TV." This time I wadded the note into a very tight ball, and threw it violently, thus speeding up the mailing process. The cicada started to fly after it, but I stopped him.   "Stay with me," I told him, "and I'll let you sit halfway on my angora sweater," and so he perched on my sleeve and kept me company.   Another cicada landed on my head, next. This one was also carrying a note from Reggie.   It read, "Please don't wad your papers so tightly, or throw them so hard. That one landed right on my head. I'm trying to think of a way to help you"  I wrote a reply that said, "Okay. Thanks," which I rolled up even tighter, and licked, just to make it harder.   We wrote back and forth like this for a long time, and by the time we were done, I was covered in cicadas, and my angora sweater was ruined. The cicadas all had wet legs from hanging around stale rain puddles, and they clung to me as if I were their only hope. It made my sweater wet. I guess, since wet sweaters are very heavy, it was enough to get me back down to the ground. Either that, or I used up all my floaty sugar. Either way, I was nothing but cold, wet, and hungry when I got home, and I never saw one helicopter.

      The noise that beating wings create with the pavement is even more fascinating than the cicada mating calls, but the latter outweighs the former in sheer pandemonium. The beating wings and the male chorus combined is almost overwhelming. Cicadas are the loudest insects on record, as far as I know. I had a chance tonight to simply stand outside and listen to them, as it is the beginning of the second week of their brooding emergence. Things are getting wild around here.  On my birthday, which was a good week and a day ago, I saw the first one. We named him Herbert and brought him to my picnic as the guest of honor. (Never mind me. I'm just the birthday girl...) My sister made a cake that looked like a cicada, which I believe was also dubbed Herbert. We ate him, but not the real cicada, who ended up flitting clumsily along the street with the rest of his kind. They are notoriously clumsy creatures, and until recently, I didn't even think they could fly more than a few feet.  About halfway into that first week, or maybe more towards the end, my sister and I discovered clusters of them inhabiting some bushes in the park. A few days later, we couldn't go anywhere without seeing them. Today, I saw one in a restaurant. The waiter and the cooks fidgeted nervously when it went weaving over our unprepared meals, but there was  nothing they could do to stop it. The insect was faster and more agile than I had ever expected a cicada to be, and if they had been able to get rid of it, not one of them could estimate just how swiftly another one would come in to take its place, and I didn't dare them to try.  Then, tonight, I saw them as I had never seen them before. In the past couple of days, the noise has been like everyone in the neighborhood mowing their lawns all at once, with the occasional incongruous chirping of a male hasty to find his mate. Tonight, when twilight had ended and the sky was black and bleary after a wanting evening, a street light shown over an empty cement patch, and I saw them again. They surrounded the light the same way moths do, only they were even more hearty a swarm than I have ever witnessed in the insect world. On the ground were the ones who beat their wings unsuccessfully. The sound is almost like a thousand little tamberines, each one with its own peculiar rhythm; each one apart from the rest, in theory, yet lost in the turbid bumble of the congregation. From the trees came the same fervent chorus that plays throughout the day. It never seems to stop.   Every once in a while, the clap and snap of wings would grab my attention as one of them launched itself off of the ground, and I would feel the flick of its body on my shin. Then I heard a howl in the distance. I thought, at first, that it was some other animal, but peering into the distance, I could make nothing out. The sound grew, and abated in cycles. It was yet another song of the cicadas, who continue to arrest and enchant me. They have not yet reached the peak of their season, at which point I imagine they will come upon us like showers, and we will watch them from windows as we view creatures in a glass case at the zoo, only this time, we will be the ones who are encased. For now, it is their time to flourish, and ours to wait, like good mortals who cannot direct the universe in the interest of our comforts. After a seventeen year wait, their is no doubt of who will make the greater compromise.

      Today I finally asked Reggie why he has been so out of focus lately. It's gotten to the point where I feel sorry for him rather than threatned, and I hardly ever abuse him anymore.  "You used to seem so smart, Reggie," I asserted, honestly, because I am an honest person.  "I am right now." he said.  "Are what right now?"  "I'm focused."  "Oh." That was a relief, "I thought you meant you were smart."

      Today is my birthday, and for my birthday, I got thousands and thousands of periodical cicadas named "Brood X." They have red eyes and orange legs, and they are very, very loud.   I have to go out right now, but I will be back with more news on my fabulous new friends.

      Another non-blog, with the always ominous threat of becoming a poem.  I'm going to write something that isn't true, for a change. It's a game. You have to guess which one thing I say is not really true.   Today I heard on the news that all of the bears in the world suddenly went extinct, and we thought it was going to be the great panda, but there is still one left. It was the result of something in the air; perhaps the west bear virus, or Scandinavian poachers. Koala bears did not follow, as they are not really true bears, and do not live in Scandinavia, nor are they susceptible to bear viruses.  Tomorrow is my twenty-third birthday, and I am going to be twenty-three. I think it's appropriate, given the circumstances. I feel quite ready, except for the fact that I ate some sausages that didn't quite settle with me, but I am optimistic that I will become older regardless of this fact.   Morning approaches. I believe I may be tired.

      I have exactly one minute to say anything at all, so this is a test of my mind. It is to see if I have the ability to draw upon important thoughts for one quick shot to sound intelligent... Do I or don't I? Hmm. Let me think.  The answer   oh poop. time's up.

      Concerning my distaste  Today I went to a place where there was a man dressed as a clown, who was standing by the opening of a flamboyantly colored circus tent.  He was sounding a horn and shouting, "Here, here! Step right up and see the wonders of my lair! Come one, come all! Hurry, while supplies last!" Then, he saw me coming, and made eye contact.  "Welcome," he said, "to my evil lair! I am Benjamin Clown, and this is my tent." Many people were filing in. He tapped each one warmly on the shoulder.   "Come right in! Don't be shy!" he directed them with enthusiasm, "I'm so proud of what my evil minions are doing in there. Six people died today! You're all sure to get your money's worth. Pain and torture only the stupid can endure. Come back next week when we have our fourth of July special, where we keep you in unspeakable agony until the fourth of July!"  Mothers, fathers, children, lovers -- a slew of spectators made their way to the triangular slit which was the only thing standing between them and possible hell.  At this point, I overheard a young mother proclaim, "It must be safe, because it is run by a clown!" This seemed reasonable enough, so I paid my toll and went in.  Upon arrival, a smatter of eminently devilish creatures with crimson eyes and sheep's' skin cloaks rushed forward and began poking us all in the eyes with rainbow swirl lollipops (the kind that are shape like unicorn horns). Afterwards, many of us rubbed our eyes as a gigantic blue monster loaded us onto a conveyer belt with a pitchfork, and a fat baby with wings and a loin cloth sloshed cucumber guts at us with tremendous accuracy.   It began to dawn on me that I was knee deep in something I had never seen before. It was the color of cooked rhubarb, the consistency of vasoline, and smelled of burnt toast and amphibian.   "Do you like it?" asked Benjamin in a drawn out manner that made me jump,"It's rhubarb frog-toast jelly. I created it to give you that icky feeling... Would you like some cotton candy?"  "Sure," I replied, not wanting to offend, "I would love some."  As I munched on the cotton candy, which was a delicious strawberry flavor, a door opened beneath me, and I fell through a tunnel into a pit of ravenous predators, who chewed on my ankles for what seemed like almost an hour, and since I had no way out, I finished my cotton candy.  When my time was up, and it was time to leave Benjanmin's lair, he gave us all blindfolds which we were instructed to adorn. When we were all wearing them, the hydraulics kicked in, and the floor lifted us all up at once, then tilted, causing us all to slide into a giant bowl of piping hot hypodermic needles. Luckily, none of the children got hurt.   At this time, we were directed to the exit, which electrocuted us as we passed through the opening back into the real world, and Benjamin Clown bid us all goodbye, saying, "Thank you so much, and do come back for our special. It will be quite an ordeal."  Benjamin runs a clean business, and I would consider going back for the cotton candy, only I believe my legs will still be numb from the ankles down. Never the less, he is, by far, the most trustworthy clown I have ever met.

      There is a butterfly living in my head, where I thought my brain was. It comes and goes. I often feel it tickling the inside of my skull, and then it flies out of my eye and into my ear, or I go to talk and it comes out of my mouth.   It wasn't so much the butterfly that concerned me, but the fact that there was room enough for a butterfly to fit in there, so I went to the doctor to have my head examined, and sure enough, it was completely empty except for the butterfly. I know, because I asked him if he had any previous files on my head, and when he came back from looking for me, he had a picture which I can only assume was an ex-ray. I say this because it was all white, except for a siluette of the butterfly.   "What is this?" he asked.   "It's a picture," I said, "A picture of a butterfly."  "Well," responded the doctor, "You seem all right to me."  Maybe it's more common a problem than I thought.

      Deep sighs and forge ahead. I take long walks.  I walked through grass and past buildings with people in them.  People, buzzing like lunatics, east, west, south, center Papers, papers black ink smell I'm going to be one of those people, Once I get where I'm going.  I walked over gravel and over pavement. My world isn't very rare. I walked one direction for so long I started to imagine that my feet had lifted off the ground And clouds were carrying me And as I searched out over the horizon I lost my gaze, and my vision.   I dropped my eyes in that haze  just below the sun.  All those purples and pinks and orange cream clouds,  and I wasn't walking anymore Nor was I among men. There are no buildings here. There are no schedules.  Time is at a standstill,  Now I can dream, but the people in my dreams  punch in with time cards. Do I dream about not dreaming? My dreams are like my walk But they have been stripped naked,  worse yet,  they have been stripped to the bone.   Would men hire strippers who stripped off their skin?   The clouded horizon is the blue horizon. It is the black horizon. The sun, from which I avert my eyes,  Is the moon, which fascinates and excites them. My eyes are blue-grey. People like to talk about them. They watch the moon without me.  They were able to feel conceit before I ever did,  and they can do many things without me,  but I implore them,   "Look at the world with me,  While I walk."   I don't mind structure. I don't mind time, but something within them is wasting.  Light posts, houses, trucks flying by, splashing dirty water on my shoes I strip every one of them from the outer layer to the muck that lies within. Thick black mucus, mixed in oil, stirring itself with our hands, smearing itself about  Papers papers, find them, pass them along keep up with the world.  Send messages. Clock in. Think well of your neighbor.  There are beautiful things.  Suppose I noticed the grass again.  Suppose I noticed the branches of a tree, old friend. Suppose I reached my house and greeted my family.  Nobody can say it's a desolate place.  I can look at the grass and the tree with one eye and the world with my glass eye,  or I can sigh and take long walks,  or meet the stripper who strips off her skin or dream about not dreaming,  or cross my eyes when I see black standing next to blue,  Which is like lying but not as wrong as murder.  I could cross my eyes and say "Too many roads" and never stop walking. Could I sigh and finish too?  My eyes looked and I walked.     I am not a poet, so I am not going to go any further with this, but it is a true story anyway

      I gave up soda, but not ice cream. Now, when I want soda, I can just eat icecream instead. It is so smooth and sweet... It is so sublime. I would give almost anything for a cup of it right now, but I feel as though I should have given that up too, or that perhaps I should at least resist it as though I had. It is an honorary sacrifice to stand with the soda in support during the banishment. No soda will suffer alone. I pine for ice cream.  I read a book written by a man who smoked a pipe, and half of the words in it were "fancy that" and the other half were, "I haven't any butter, for the maid stopped by today, and she is so fond of fresh butter that I told her she could have some on her toast, but she took advantage of my genorous offer and hid it all in her petty coat. I don't see how she ever got it home."  It was not a very long book.  I'm very very tired, and the T.V. is on. Reggie, can you think while the T.V. is on?  I ask Reggie questions while I know he cannot be thinking.   "Reggie, can you hear when the T.V. is on? Can you see, or smell, or speak?"  Reggie turned to me and mumbled something about the dome.   "The dome?" I asked. He mumbled again. There's a dome outside of the house next door. That is, around it. It's clear, and is made of a sturdy material, like scratch resistand plexi-glass, or some such thing. It covers the whole house, and I think it's been there ever since the baby was born. I naver saw anyone come and construct the thing over the house. it was just there one day.   Reggie kept trying to talk, but the T.V. was on, and so his senses were warped... like home made paper, and he was still saying something about the plastic dome, so I stopped and listened, and here is what he said.   "Noke evem sisisisisi over the wall," he said.   "Over the wall?"  "Yes, kuskus usukkumuh umuh th that tis swut Teye said."  "You cannot see over the wall. There is a roof over tha wall, and a plastic thing over the roof. There really isn't any way to get in."  "Aliens." he said.   "No aliens," I told him, "Just a baby, and a lot of people singing every night. Probably a cult over there. Probably moving things with their minds. They say that's how they built the pyramids."  Reggie focused, but not enough.   " They  didn't build the pyramids," he objected, pointing to the house.   "No, not them," I corrected, "The impervious  they .  They  built the pyramids, using just their minds. All at once they made the rocks float."  "With slaves dragging beneath them," added Reggie, "And ropes hanging above them. And wheels rolling behind..."  "By the power of the mind."  "Yes, by the power of the mind."  "And that's how they got that dome up over that house, too."  "I can't think of any other way." And it's true. I can't. They must be egyptians.  After we had that all cleared up, I read my book again, for the tenth time.   "Why do you just keep reading that one line over and over?" asked Reggie, who seemed to be focusing quite well.  "Are there more lines?" I asked. I hadn't seen any other lines, but it turned out there was a whole book full, at least a thousand before that line, and at least a thousand more after. I thought,  Well, this make it rather complicated, as I have recommended this book to many people already, being under the impression that it was quite short and concise. As it is I don't think many people will like it much at all. I can see where I missed all those lines before... in retrospect, if I study myself very closely, and the book not at all.   Well, Reggie pointed out that if I was wrong about that, then possibly I was wrong about the pyramids and the plastic dome over the neighbors house, but I still haven't any better explanation.

      I'm back! I have not written in a while, because I cheated and started a new blog on another site! (bad, bad mulya)  I had to come back to this one today, however, to announce the retirement of my old tree. Half of her blew down, you see, and so the rest of her is going away, they say, "to a better place." Where could that be, I wonder. Perhaps a field far away where she can chase sticks and play with other trees to her heart's content. Maybe she'll even meet another half-a-tree and they'll get married and have little baby half-trees and live happily for half of the rest of their days. Come to think of it, I don't think she'd be too keen on chasing sticks. That would be the equivalent of me chasing severe arms for fun. I'd better tell them that where ever they're taking her, they might want to think it over. I don't want anyone traumatizing my tree.   Anyway, I asked Lunquin (our tenant -- see Jan 14 2004) what he planned on doing, now that his shade tree is gone. He looked at me with those big, tired, grey eyes of his and said that he should like to find a place nearby. I never realized how fond he was of this neighborhood, let alone my family, but he said that if he was ever to have to wake up, as he must on occasion, he'd like to know that he has a friend nearby, especially one who likes to tell stories.   It was a bitter-sweet conversation. I admitted that I was not sure how easy it would be for a gelatinous boulder to find a similar living arrangement in the same neighborhood, and offered to give be a reference for him. I also told him not to be in any rush to leave. He didn't seem worried, but did mention that he hoped to find a place before the tree was altogether taken away.
