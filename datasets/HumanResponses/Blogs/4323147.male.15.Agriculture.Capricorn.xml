       Hey whats happening, this shit is totally deticated to drugs in any way, shape, or form. Any kind of drugs can be discussed and you can just give tips on how to enjoy your favorite drugs. So, to start the intergalactic spaciness here's a little tip on how to liquify weed.       Making drinkable marijuana or (Green Dragon): Green Dragon is an alcohol/THC based drink. It isvery simple to make and has very pleasurable effects.    How does it Work? Well, the active ingredient in marijuana is THC, which is not a water-soluble compound. So, the THC has tobe extracted using alcohol and then added to food and/or liquid that can then be entered directly to your system through the digestive tract rather than through the lungs. This type of consumption of marijuana tends to be both slower and more efficient than smoking it. Further the unpleasant effects of smoking heated smoke are completely eliminated. For these reasons this is the favored method of marijuana consumption by many people.      Note:The highest proof alcohol available should be used.(Everclear is suggested)    Method One:To do this you must obtain the highest proof alcohol available. This allows for the best results. 190 proof is highly recommended. Then one must then obtain marijuana. Rule of Thumb: (About one half gram per ounce ofalcohol.) Remember, the more the merrier. After one has these materials, they can begin.    First break up the marijuana and take out all seeds. You may leave the stems. Then open the bottle of alcohol and pour about a forth out. This will allow room for the weed. Then carefully add all broken up herbal matter into the bottle. Put the cap back on and shake. Now, store it in a safe area and let it sit for approximately 2 to 3 weeks.       After the long awaited wait, pour the green tinted substance into another container through a strainer. You may use a coffee filter.The final product is high proof alcohol laced with high amounts of pure THC.    Note:One may drink the product straight, but this is not recommended. A common way of consumption is to mix three parts 7-Up with one part Green Dragon and a dollop of honey stirred in. Served over ice.    A faster method is to heat the alcohol to a sub-boiling temperature and stir in the crushed marijuana. Great deal of care should be taken if this method is chosen, as the alcohol is highly flammable.    Note:Use an electric stove. OR Put the alcohol in a pan, and put that pan into a pot of boiling water (thereby heating the alcohol safely.)Avoid using an open flame. OR Heat the alcohol with herbal mixture in the microwave at half power for approximately 11 to 16 minutes or until liquid is an emerald shade of light green. This is method of heating should be a last resort.    First, heat up alcohol using any method. Then stir in the crushed herbal blend while alcohol is at sub-boiling temperatures and let sit. Stirring every couple of minutes. This should take no longer then 25 minutes. Turn off stove and let cool. Then take the product and strain it. A coffee filter works just fine.    Note:Use rubber gloves when straining the liquid. If you are using a coffee filter, make sure to squeeze any extra liquid out of the marijuana mesh; this is wheremost of the liquid THC is still hiding.    Consumption Notes: If you wish you could pour the final product into a bowl of cherries and let sit over night in the refrigerator. Then strain and keep liquid. What this does is lets the cherries become saturated in the Green Dragon. One may then eat the cherries to become drunk and high. Doses range from 20 to 40 cherries. Now, the liquid is still good, use it to make mixed drinks and/or other methods of consumption. (Consider making Jell-o shots.) Enjoy.      this recipe is taken from  urlLink www.neonjoint.com
