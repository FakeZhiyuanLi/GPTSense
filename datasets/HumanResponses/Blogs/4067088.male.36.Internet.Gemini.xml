       Didnt get to blog last night...We worked from 8:30 a.m. until 1:00 a.m. We were done earlier but were faced with a cardre assistance program where our Earth Mother, Helene, offered to have EVERY group stay until every group was finished - "No Child Left Behind".      Ha ha. Too tired to laugh.      We had to:      1) Program the LEGO Robot to drop off the "weather satellite" -see the video   2) Build a "Mission to Mars" website outlining our efforts this week   3) Build the video of our mission      All the while learning about constructionist learning theory (I think). What was a VERY frustrating week was debriefed last night and most of us now "get it". Tough road to get to here, but we are much further along down the theory trail than I originally thought. While getting frustrated and angry was "Part of the Process" it was irritating and not the way I usually train adults.      But this is a college course and the Intellectuals need to prove that the Theoretical actually Works. Not sure what this strategey would do to a room full of professionals, but we shall see. There are going to be lots of learning theories that I am going to learn over the next year. This one, however, is not my learning style and was difficult to get through.      But, I am glad that I did. The morning after the mega work project is rather mellow. People are dragging a little (myself included) - I haven't been in bed before 1:00 a.m. all week. Such is life.      VIRTCamp is just about over. We all go home in a couple hours. We won't see these people until January, but we'll be talkin' online!       Good week, but the most frustrating week of my professional career.

       Even though the day has been much shorter, it has been rather hellacious. Can't put my finger on exaclty why. Perhaps I stayed up too late last night working on the site, or perhaps it is becuase people seemed to be rude today. No names, just an enhanced dose of rudeness from some of the people. Sorry that this is hard, but well, that's life.    &nbsp;  Other than rudeness, was a good day. Got to build with the Lego Mindstorms again today...couldn't get the "brick" to talk to the PC via infrared. Didn't have batteries in the brick. Added batteries. Couldn't get it to connect. The design is kind of blocking the sensor (my bad) and we have to program in an awkward way.     &nbsp;  Still doesn't work.    &nbsp;  Also, we did more Dreamweaver (which I got recruited to help with) and also did Fireworks (which I worked through). No big whoop, but was called on again to help. I am liking this a little better now...I am being targeted as a HELPER as opposed to a know it all. My big concern (my big mouth) seems to be an ASSET now. Which is a good thing.    &nbsp;  So, we are off to to Paradise Cove for dinner. Maybe I'll get another ticket! HA!     &nbsp;  No. I won't.    &nbsp;  Vroom...vroom...vrooom...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       Had a great time at the bar this evening. Unfortunately, was enjoying driving QUICKLY along PCH and got pulled over by a cop for 68 in a 45. That should be expensive...    &nbsp;  With traffic school, the points should fall off the record, but DAMN, that is going to be expensive...    &nbsp;

       Well...day 2. What can I say? This was the day I expected while simultaneously being the day I dreaded. Lots of technical and lots of expectations placed upon me. I work hard to both be a resource while simultaneously&nbsp;being non-invasive. I dont want to&nbsp;be the "know it all" or the jag off that constantly goes&nbsp;to everyone and "helps" and "corrects" and is a dick.     Not that&nbsp;I was hiding.&nbsp;When dragged into the work, I didn't want to take over and I&nbsp;think I did OK. How much is too much? I am supposed to be involved and bond, but I don't want to&nbsp;be perceived as a wierdo or&nbsp;freak&nbsp;always butting in. There is always one of those in every class and when I worry about if I am being the&nbsp;"one", I cant seem to locate that one in the class. This session seemed that way for me.    Technology I&nbsp;got. Web dev, Flash, graphics, video I got. Educational foundations and structutal theory I don't got. Which is why I am here. However, while I am here, I got to build in Lego,&nbsp;cut vegetables and overanalyze nerds. I&nbsp;know&nbsp;that they are working on the whole team building thing with us, but I am not&nbsp;"feeling" it yet. I have made some GREAT connections with some of the people in the&nbsp;class, but not all of them. Do I want to? Sure, they&nbsp;all seem like nice people, but will I? DOn't know...when did I&nbsp;turn into such a stiff? I used to&nbsp;be fun?&nbsp;Am I still fun? Do I know how to have fun anymore?&nbsp;    Work work work. I worked in class today. I work too much anyway. Lament, lament, bitch, cry, moan, lament...no one is listening anyway.    I think that this program will challenge me in a number of ways. All good. I am optimistic, but still bitching. How can I&nbsp;say I am optimistic if I continue to be nervous, anxious and crabby. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? Damn, dude. Get over yourself.   &nbsp;

       We are supposed to be writing about our first impressions, how we feel about certain aspects of the program and our general state of mind. Well, let’s see…  A bit concerned. I must reiterate again about the number of K-12 teachers who are in attendance. What does this program have to offer these people? Compared to the types of programs I am building, what is the odds that these people will even come close to building programs like that? What does the technology do for these people? How is learning the Macromedia Suite of products going to help them improve their jobs? I have spent my entire CAREER learning this stuff, what is it going to do for the average teacher.  Then again, perhaps these are not average teachers. Pehaps this course will be targeted to teaching these teachers how to use technology in their class rooms and with their students. Perhaps these techniques will be most beneficial for teachers and they will go on to do great things.  Well, big whoop for me.  After all, I am a corporate trainer.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Should I be here spending this kind of money for an ego thing? Should I even consider the MA Ed because it seems tied so closely to EDUCATION and not adult oriented training. I would like to be able to better work with the technology of the educational world and may eventually move here, but am concerned that I won’t be able to make the money that I will need to be successful or be able to direcly apply what I am learning here to the web and elearning world.  I know. I am just freaking out. The MA Ed will be an important stepping stone for me. Being back into the school system will be a nice break away from the corporate world. BUT, I really need to focus on growing the business. Is it fair and right to take the time away from dWeb and apply it to the MA just for an ego thing.  I really need to talk with Paul or Sue in order to get a clear idea of how this will benefit me. I need to get a clear understanding of exactly WHAT I am going to take away from all of this. Just getting a little frustrated.  Grrr….

       Ok...I have been reading the Action Research Project books and am getting a little nervous. Making changes to behavior in a department or with a group of professionals is easy when working in a typical 9 to 5 job. As a small business owner, who has more contractors than employees, and the typical project lasts four to six weeks, how am I going to develop an ARP that works for me and my tiny group?      Every customer is different. Every need is different. Every project scales differently. Scope creep is EVERYWHERE! What am I going to address?      Don says it will hit me like a ton of bricks. Ok. I am waiting with my umbrella...nothing is falling yet.

       All I can do is laugh...I read fast, I think fast, I work fast, and if you have been reading this Blog, I drive fast. (Damn inline v6 3.2 L 240 hp engine...vroom vroom.)      And now I know how much it costs! HA! I was expecting the worst - at a minimum $400. But NOOOO! My speeding ticket (68 in a 45) down PCH, top down, surf and turf, engine revving is only  $190!!!  $190 for fun in the moonlight, ass hauling, zipping down PCH for fun. My bottle of wine at dinner on Friday cost more! HA!!!!       Now I just have to take traffic school to get if off my record, and this Speed Racer will be back in action.      Took the weekend off (ask me about the Rainforest Disco Party on Saturday night - Disco inferno indeed) and am back at it. I will blog about the "serious" work I am doing in the MA Ed program, but for now I had to do the Ewok dance of Joy!

       I am better than this...I am getting frustrated teaching a client about a VERY complex program and reading the BlackBoard this afternoon (I think it was Tanisha's post) regarding people who don't pay attention and then asking questions later when asked to perform came to mind.      Complex program. $100K impelementation of the software. (I didn't see any of it...still have to figure out how to pay the ticket...) Lots of variations and steps and complex functionality. In four weeks, I am off this project and he has to do this on his own. NO NOTES. NO QUESTIONS. NO CONCERN. NO FEEDBACK.      I know it is just a one on one and lots to handle, but come on dude! Get excited! Get into it. WRITE SOMETHING DOWN becuase YOU AINT GOING TO REMEMBER it. When I am off this client I am OFF this client. Not coming back to help. You are on your own. You are not getting this. You forgot it all when you got up to check your eMail.      You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. How did Tanisha put it? You can't teach an old dog new tricks...unless it wants to learn.

        The classes so far have been a little frustrating and I think I figured out why. I have downloaded and created article PDFs, ordered my books and have the syllabus from the classes, but it doesn't feel like I am in school. I have an anxiety about the work and getting things done that I didn't expect to have. 75% of my customers are handled virtually, so what is the deal here.  Structure - lack of structure is what is bothering me. I am not going to classes with papers and notebooks and pens and books. I am sitting here in my office with a machine that replaces all of that. Switching from program to program on the PC is much different than flipping through a stack of papers.  To compensate for this sense of chaos, I have decided to force myself to get organized - treat the elements of the class as if I were attending at the Malibu campus every week.  I know it sounds stupid, but I have started to print out EVERYTHING. Yesterday, I picked up a binder for articles, some highlighters and dividers so that I can get organized. Force myself to get organized. Having the paperwork and being able to flip to a page seems much better for me.  Me...Computer geek extreme...likes paper. Weird, but reality for now. Didn't think I'd discover that...

       Summary of the week so far.      Read some stuff on Monday. Packed. Read some more stuff. Worked on Datallegro.      Tuesday: Flew to DC. No problemo. Get to my Hotel. Nice wireless connection. Six Unauthorized attempts to gain access to my system (THANK YOU Norton Personal Firewall) and a s l o w connection. Get angry. Have nice dinner with friends.      Wednesday. All day in  meetings for ASTD. Paul doesn't send me his proposal. Can't get him in. Sad.   Log in from my hotel room, get attacked again, and connection dies. Panic sets in. Move to the LOBBY. Decent connection. Forget that my access codes are in my room and the mouse dies. Go back up. Take a phone call. Add six hours work tonight AFTER class at 11:30 local time. No sleep tonight.      So, I am in the lobby, with reconstituted Cranberry juice drink (well, its a liquid anyway), getting eyed by the minimum wage cleaning people, blogging and researching Action Research projects for class tonight. Respond to Blackboard posts, try to think out of the box regarding the ARP (mine is going to be hard to pin down) and stress because I have to do my work from the LOBBY of this cheesy hotel.       This is how it is going to be for a while. Miss the wife and kids, but life is going to be interesting.       Going to login to class early today. Maybe catch a few friends before class starts.

       Crap...Thats all I can say. Crap crap crap crap crap.      So much to remember, so drained from last week. The first session is on Wednesday at 5:00 and 8:30. I am in DC on Wednesday and will have to attend from the hotel.      What should we prepare? How do we prepare? Books aren't going to get here on time so what do we talk about. Blackboard goes up and down, what do we do about that.      Can't seem to navigate in IT yet...will get it...kind of frustrating. We covered so much last week and a good nights sleep seems to have removed everything from my brain. Getting back into work (Datallegro is killing me) has sucked the University out of my brain.       Must get back into the groove.      Tried talking with the wife about the ARP and we are both stressing about exactly how to do what I need to do for the MA while still running my business. How is the more traditional verisons of previous ARPs going to apply to my company. We decided to just wait until the first real semister to help decide exactly how to do it. Have to figure it out as we get closer, but more nerves are creeping back in.       Well, have to order two more books now...
