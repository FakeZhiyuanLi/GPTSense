      Well my week's vacation from school is over and am excited to go back on monday for the summer quarter.  I found out my grades for the spring quarter, and am soooooooo happy that I got on the President's List again (GPA 3.75 to 4.0) I got an "A" in English Composition I - "A" in Medical Terminology - "A" in Keyboarding (class was to easy) - "B" in Anatomy & Physiology I. But I have to admit I was a little upset about my A&P grade as I was only one point away from an "A" :(  I couldn't believe it, just one little stinkin point LOL :)  Oh well! So that put my GPA at 3.75, but in the winter quarter my GPA was 4.0, so combine the two GPA's and I am sitting at 3.87 (YYYEAAHHH).   My new classes for the summer quarter are:  Computer Applications Medical Law & Ethics/Therapuetic Communications Anatomy & Pathophysiology II English Composition II  Over my weeks break from school my husband and I went down memory lane and took a trip to our home (we call home of where we first met 11 years ago) to Copperas Cove/Killeen/Fort Hood. Oh! how I missed the place and didn't want to come back. Alot has changed since we were there, but in about 5 years we will permenately retire there for good :)  The only things that sucks is, they don't have medical assistant jobs :( They only have LVN or RN jobs. The town is small and a little behind the time with big cities, as when we went there for the 4th of July weekend, they had just took into effect the no smoking policy in buildings (if that gives you an idea how slow the town is LOL ) Copperas Cove is the town we want to live at and right now it's popluation is only 29,533. The place is perfect for us with how beautiful the scenic nature is with the beautiful mountains, lush green trees and grass, lakes, and most of all the wonderful temperatures at night and during day verses here in the DFW area :) So guess I will wait and see how the job hunting will go once we move there :)  I would like to Thank the Medical-Assistants yahoo group for sharing this wonderful site. I don't post much there as so busy with studying, taking care of 3 kids, house, etc... that this is a whole lot easier for me to do for all to see what is happening with me and also for all my other family and friends to know too :)  Thank You!!  Til next time!

      Tonight is the first night of starting my new set of summer quarter classes, and I am a bit excited.  Tonights class is computer applications and it is a five hour class (yuck on the hours) but am excited to learn all the microsoft application programs.  I just wonder how long am I gonna have to wait to get my book. On the first night of each new semester, you have to wait til the book keeper comes to the class to say we can get our book. I hate doing it that way and wish the school would do it like they have mentioned to me, is that they are trying to let us old students get our books before the quarter is out, so all they have to do is give out the books for the new students, but that will never happen.  I wish I could get my two other books tonight, but know they won't let me. I will be using my A&P books again and my English Composition books again so that saves me bookshelf room LOL :) The only other two books I will be getting is Medical Law & Ethics and Therapuetic Communications. I am anxious to start all of the new classes and see how it goes. The only thing I am wondering is what Instructors am I getting and how are they.  Will post tomorrow of how my first night of class went and for each new class this week :)    Til next time!

      Well I know I said I would post everyday about my new classes, but got so busy I forgot.  Monday night I had Computer Applications and it came with a really BIG book. The class was easy and think this class will be easy for me, let alone fun :)  Right now we are doing Microsoft Word (which I already know).  The instructor seems to be a pretty good person and funny.  Tuesday night I had Medical Law & Ethics/Therapuetic Communications. That night we went over Medical Law. This instructor is new and he is a pretty good guy. He was an officier in the Army with an MOS of 91 Bravo (civilian terms EMT). He still carries the military attitude towards keeping the class quiet and trys to crunch everything in, in one night (which that for me got a little overwhelming, but did manage to finish what he wanted done). Next week he wants to go over Therapuetic Communications. Now that book I am interested in, as he wants us to read the first chapter which I did. I skimmed through the book and this book is going to be fun for me at least :)  For the medical law part, he wants us to find an article every week either online or in newspapters etc, and write a one page summary. So I need to start doing a search for articles of that nature online. He also mentioned that if we wear our scrubs every week, he will give us 3 points and we can use that towards our mid term or final exam.  Last night was Anatomy and Pathophysiology II. This teacher is gonna be a tough one for me (here my luck with good teachers was doing good so far the whole time in school LOL). But we didn't get to stay long, as the air conditioner was out in the building, and an hour later the dean sent all of us home. We are going over blood as our first chapter. But she mentioned that she likes to make her test and quizzes challanging for fun. She made it sound like the "A" in her class will be a challange in itself :(  With me not feeling well this week, my mind went negative saying to myself, there goes my Presidents List this quarter".  But I got myself out of that negative mode and told myself that this is my true challange to prove I can get an "A" with her challange.  Tonight I have English Composition II so will see how that goes tonight. But that is how my week  has been going so far. So far got 2 easy classes and one challanging one, will find out how tonights class will go :)  TTFN!!

       Alot has happened since last post. Over the weekend I went to Colorado Springs for my brothers wedding (you can read all about it at:  urlLink www.livejournal.com/users/txladi )       School is going good. I just finished my 3rd week and so far so good. On monday night I have computer applications and that class is pretty easy for me. On monday we start Microsoft Excel, so can't wait to learn that.       Tueday night I have Medical Law & Ethics/Therapeutic Communication. That class is ok, truthfully the teacher is making it boring :(  But over all he is pretty good. Our final exam is so easy. Each week I have to find an article over both subject and clip it out, write a one page summary, have a cover sheet for both, and have a reference sheet for both. We turn them all in (total of 24 articles) at the end of the quarter.  For me all the terms in Medical Law are confusing, while in Therapeutic for me is more interesting. I actually enjoy Therapeutic more (if only the instructor would make it more fun to learn, I would be forever happy and not sleepy in class LOL). I have a my first quiz this coming tuesday in Therapeutic.       Wednesday night I have Anatomy and Pathophysiology II. So far we went over the blood and the heart. I actually enjoyed the heart and caught on pretty quickly of how the blood flows through the heart and the names of the atrias, ventricles, etc of the heart. We have 2 quizes this coming wednesday on what we just went over, as we are behind in that class. First week we went home an hour later due to AC going out at school. Last week had a substitute in that class, and I actually enjoyed the substitute as she was a Dr. She used to be a cardiologist but has changed her major to herbal. She told us lots of stories good, bad, sad, and gross (but for me it was sooo exciting to hear them all).       Thursday I have English Composition II. Now I do not like english but this instructor makes it fun (and this instructor actually teaches us, so I am learning something yeahhhh LOL). Last night I just turned in my first essay which was over cause and effect. Now my next new essay is over compare and contrast. I first thought of doing a compare and contrast with my brother, but realized he and I have a whole lot of similarities so would be hard. So I decided to do a compare and contrast with my mother as she and I are alike but soooo different on alot of things that she will make it easier for me to write this essay LOL :) Also last night our instructor had us watch two different versions of Romeo & Juliet to help show us compare and contrast. Would you believe I did not understand and darn word of Shakespeare LOL :) The instructor picked on me LOL but I seriously did not understand a word :)       Other than that I am trying to figure out how to be my tutoring done in Pre-Alegbra and English, as I didn't quite pass the COMPASS entrance exam on those two areas. I have to have those two tutors done my October, so guess I better get my hiny moving LOL. I can do them both online, so that makes it easier for me.       Lets see... OH! on tuesday a class mate in another class was needing a volunteer for practice with phlebotomy, so I volunteered. Boy the memories came back of when I learned how to do them (when I took Medical Assistant class before). I wasn't nervous but he was, but he did a good job and listened to me when I told him I have rolly poly veins :)  Then another girl asked if she could so I let her. But she was definitely nervous, as they were using the butterflys. She didn't quite get the bity needle in right, as when she was trying to get the file pluged in, blood was coming out of the bevel on my skin. The poor girl felt so bad and nervous. I told her she did not hurt me and I am fine and not upset or anything. I wanted to tell her a secret that I still remember about doing phlebotomy, but decided against it as they all thought I was new and never done that stuff before. BOY!!  I wanted to stay in the class tuesday night and not go back to Therapeutic class LOL. The only thing the two of them did forget about was the turnakit that they left on my arm and had to remind them to take it off (even the instructor told them) as it was turning my arm red and blue by no circulation. I had remembered that it is only to stay on your arm for 30 seconds, so once you put it on, you better be ready to stick right away and while you are drawing the blood to the vile, take the thing off (which they didn't). But yet I understood there nervousness as the instructor is right there watching them as he has too. But still I can't wait to start that class :)         Anyho that is all I can remember of what has been going on with me in school :)  Will post more later when I can :)       TTFN

      Well I have been sooo busy this week with getting my kids ready for school tomorrow, that I haven't had much time to study :(    Monday in computer applications we started learning Microsoft Excel. I learned little about Excel so the class assignment was easy for me. The instructor  picked on my husband and I, as we finished the labs early in class and completed this coming mondays homework and turned it in. She said we are killing her LOL :)  But she honestly said that she does not worry about the both of us with our knowledge with the programs, as we are her assistants in a way. We help her out in class with other students needing help with the class assignment.  Last week we took our Microsoft Word Exam and got an "A". The Exam consisted of 50 questions open book and got to pair up with a partner (so yes my hubby was my partner).  Tuesday in medical law and ethics/therapeutic communications we had our first test and I missed two (which wasn't bad for not really getting a chance to study much for it). Medical Law and Ethics terminology is so much to know, but thank goodness the instructor isn't to worried about it right now, but said he will help us know them later. Therapeutic Communication I actually enjoy learning the most. I find that class more interesting and fun for me. I am behind on my weekly articles for both subjects and need to hurry up and catch up.  Wednesday in A&P II last week, we went over the blood and the heart. The blood confused me, but the heart I picked up pretty easily, surprisingly with heart being so detailed with all the atrias, ventricles, muscles, and how the blood flows through the heart. Tonight I have 2 tests to take and they are over last weeks lectures. I honestly haven't had time to study both of them and seriously need to today. So I hope I do ok tonight on the two tests.  Thursday in english composition II we went over compare and contrast. The instructor had us watch two different versions of Romeo and Juliet. Did I understand what they were saying No LOL :)  I decided to do my compare and contrast over my mother and I. She and I are so much alike but yet so very different. It was amazing what I came up with, it's like the old saying goes, opposites attract LOL :)  Don't get me wrong, I love the relationship and cherish deeply the relationship that my mother and I have. I would not trade it for anything and she knows that. When she called me over the weekend, I told her I was doing this essay and she just laughed with me at our differences :)  The rough draft is due tomorrow and I haven't even started writing it :( And it has to be 1500 to 1800 words, that's 5 to 7 pages long.  So hopefully I can get it done tomorrow, as I have to drive my husband into work tomorrow morning just so I can take my kids to school and then pick them up and pick him up so we can go to school tomorrow night. Boy am I going to be exhausted. My other car is still out of commission, but hopefully will get fixed this weekend (at least it better LOL).  But that is my update for this week anyways LOL :)  Got to finish getting things ready for the kids tomorrow and start studying. Will update next week :)  TTFN
