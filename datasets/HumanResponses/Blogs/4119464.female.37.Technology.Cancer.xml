       You guessed it. Out last night. Jojo's house and then The Main Event. Here's the truth about my Sunday Morning After's...for the most part...excluding one regrettable evening in the not far enough past, I'm pretty well behaved when out on the town. With the exception of acting the fool on the dance floor. I love music and love to dance. I'm quite aware of the fact that I look like I'm on "Crack Cocaine" but here's another truth...I simply don't care what people think when they see me dance. It's all about fun and it doesn't hurt anyone so there  (sticking tongue out and thumbing my nose ).      So, about last night, we had the best time! Drinks and some kind of vegetable and chicken stiff fry affair at Jo's, Chris de Burgh's latest CD playing in the background while we indulged in "Girl Talk". Jojo's hubby headed out to a clam bake or some such thing so it was just us girls. The band at the Event was this group of young boys called, "The Mitchell Spencer Band" and they were hot. When we arrived it was still fairly early so we got to just sit back and listen for a bit and I have to say I was impressed. I doubt that anyone in the band was over 25 yet they played a terrific selection of Rock tunes from my 20's and even earlier. U2, BTO, AC/DC, Pink Floyd (awesome job of Another Brick in the Wall) as well they played some more current selections that I have to admit I'm less inclined to recall the names of, and then the real icing on the cake was a mix of their own original music. To check them out and hear one of their original tunes for yourself go to  urlLink http://www.mitchellspencer.com/  you won't be disappointed.      Unfortunately for me, going to bed at 3:30 am is not a great idea. Especially when Ahna wakes up at 7:00 am. Truth...and this never fails, if you have a small child...the chance of the child sleeping in is directly proportional to the hour you go to sleep. The later you lay your head on the pillow the earlier your child is likely to rise. Guaranteed! So from 7:00 am till about 7:08 am I tried to talk her into coming in bed with me...usually she loves mommy's bed. She'll often say, "Ahna come in with the waves mommy?" (I have a waterbed) But not this morning...this morning not only did she not want to "come in with the waves", she didn't want to do anything that involved staying on the second floor of the house...so I dragged my "tired but" out of bed and we made for the living room. I thought, hmmm...I can be a bad mommy for an hour or two and just veg on the couch and watch Dora, Dragon Tales, Clifford, Barney. WRONG!!!!!! This morning my child wants to play school and apparently it's music class this morning cause the Drum (oy!), the Xylophone, Flute, Saxaphone and Piano were quickly pulled to the center of the floor and the concert was on...my little Mozarta was at her best and quite anxious to include mommy in class I was chosen to play the Saxaphone and quickly reprimanded when I tried to play it laying on the couch..."Get Up Mommy!, Get up and play the "sphone" Eventually I convinced her that we should have breakfast cuddle up and watch Drangon Tales but by then I was fully awake...lol.     The rest of my day I spent doing the chores that got neglected yesterday in favor of hanging out with the kids. Oops, what am I saying...Truth is.... I lazed around with the girls and did very little but I kept thinking I might do some stuff and actually hung a shelf and a few "nick nacks" around the place.       Thanks for reading. Hope you had a great weekend and try not to work too hard this week, eh!

       Hello again,      Today is the last day of training for the new contract and we're all a little unsure of what we learned and how it will translate into our first phone call. Myself I will probably panic on Monday morning as I log into my computer for my first shift. In the meantime, it's Friday and that means in a few short hours I get to hang out with the girls for the weekend. YIPPEE!      Yesterday after work, we changed and went to the beach with my sister and her kids. We hung out there for a couple of hours and then went out to eat. A couple of truths about that are: 1. I love the beach...but hate the sand in my shoes afterwards (and the many other places I find it). 2. I love not having to cook when I've had a long day....but, for the most part, I hate take-out food.      It's the weekend and there's a lot to do around the house. We finished papering and painting the kitchen last Tuesday but I have not had a chance to get everything back in it's rightful place. I intend to put a lot less back then was originally there and intend to trim in other areas as well including the computer room and the living room.       Another truth, the amount of work that gets accomplished around my home is directly proportional to how nice it is outside and/or how many children are hanging out in the living room. However, I love hanging out on the deck while the kids play in the yard and do not consider that lost time at all and I also love having the kids in the house doing crafts, playing a game, dancing around the livingroom taking turns doing kareoke or just watching a movie. So if we spend quality time together, chores get put off and the furniture accumulates a little extra dust...so be it.    It is suppose to rain so we might actually get some things accomplished around the house and if not we'll have fun ignoring the work. Thanks for reading...that's all I have for today.

       So...here we go. I have long known of blogs but didn't really know what a blog was. I probably still don't but it seems like it might be a fun concept. My thoughts, dreams, opinions, and random ideas appearing in print and potentially available to the masses. Isn't technology wonderful.      Over the course of this blog you will likely learn more than you care to about me, my family (particulary my girls), my cat (Max) and my various life experiences. Don't you feel privileged? Naw....      Today I started the training updates for a new contract that I will be working on. So far the only thing new is that I'm freezing to death as the airconditioning is blasting the room with cold air. Perhaps if I was not freezing I would be able to concentrate on what's being said in the classroom and actually learn something. I suspect I would as the trainer is one I've had before and is usually a very good teacher.       I suppose I should confess that part of the problem may infact be my own fault. I didn't exactly get the best sleep last night so my ablity to cope with the chilly room and focus beyond that is diminished. Went to bed late and then the baby woke several times during the night.      So here's the first truth...I always go to bed late...I always say, "I'm going to go to bed early and get a good sleep." but I always go to bed late. Part of the reason is that I don't like going to bed. I think too much lying there before sleep the mind starts working and won't stop and I can't get to sleep for all of the thinking. So if I stay up until I am too tired to think than I get to sleep faster...mind you, by then it's past midnight often heading for 1 am and I am a bit grumpy getting up the next morning. Hmmm, so what does this tell me? I should go to bed earlier, right. I know. But it seems either way I'll be tired and by staying up late I avoid the lying in bed thinking about things part.    Thanks for reading my ramblings. I promise I'll try to do better next time.
