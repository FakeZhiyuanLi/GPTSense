      Tonight, Katie and I had an amazing adventure! Holy shit, it was crazy. Ok, so Katie and I decided to go to Minneapolis for the night but unfortunately, we didn't know how to get there. So aimlessly we ended up in a wildlife refuge on Lyndale and a Walgreens in Burnsville. Finally, we got to Mlps and were finding a place to hang out when as we were turning left... fuck, we got hit by a car on the driver's side and almost hit two drunks skidding into the streetcorner. The people that hit us were really nice and we exchanged info, da da da. Haha but the highlight of our accident was the drunk Mexican telling us to "Run! You can still get away with it!" He kept trying to get in our car, telling us to drive away, and giving us part of the headlight until the other driver pushed him away and we took off wanting to continue our adventure. After getting that dirt off our shoulder, we parked by Caribou and "just happened" to walk by a gay bar called the Mlps Eagle. So me with my great ideas dragged Katie in, thinking it would be a cool, mixed, GBLT scene. Wrong again. Full of muscular guys in tight tee shirts staring at us for the full 15 seconds we were in there until the bouncer kicked us out. It was pretty safe to say we were the only females present. Ha. Continuing on... Ended up around Block E. Wow, it was kick ass! We found a really hot club 3rd Degree, got hit on innumerable times, and signed a homeless person's jacket. And we can't forget our tollbooth man who said "and I especially like your nose." Nice. Things to know: if someone drops a dime, DON'T pick it up, people who ask for directions usually know where they're going, and if all else fails, you're temporarily a lesbian. And don't go on Child's Road; you'll end up in a sewage plant and desperately avoiding street racers.

      Playing hooky to finish my biology paper on the excretory system. Excellent. So I'm wasting time and was flipping though Sara's blog and found this:  One time in Florida, I was eating at Planet Hollywood with Susan, Vicky and Nicole and we were trying to take some pictures and this guy offered to take one for us so we could all be in it. So we started to talk after and let me tell you, this man was absolutely amazing! Well, I truly believe that he was an angel. He was so fun and he was with his daughter. We believed he may be terminal or something for many reasons. He had this great outlook on life and his daughter didn't get embarrassesd when he danced around. Every once and a while he pops up in my head and I remember to live my life to the fullest, thats the mark he left with me.   Now getting as teary as I was in AP History watching Band of Brothers and Easy Company find the concentration camp...  11:11, Make a wish...  I hope he's still alive. He deserves so much more than this.

      Nikki, didn't mean to forget you, but I really needed to dedicate this one to you. You're the one who will always keep me going at Planet Spirit and I'm so happy that we going through all this change together. I'll be sure to repeat my banana trick soon (Six Flags, anyone??) and I love you even if you hated me this time last year. Haha. Bye.

      Ok, yeah. I'm going to be hip and start blogging. I need an outlet for my emotions so this will work for me. Well, I'm Vicky and I'm currently 15. I'm a sophmore, living in the Godforsaken hellhole known as Minnesota. I like traveling, competitive cheerleading at Planet Spirit, having energy, and being nice. I don't like school, nosy people, and smoking. And close-minded people that hide behind conformity by making obnoxious comments about things they have no idea about. I'm being homeschooled next year because there's no point for me to go to public right now (yes, my friends and I will hang out all the time, I'm not a loner) and I have a HUGE impulse to learn with very little time to do it in regular school. So, my blog is presumably going to stay pretty artsy, depression, i-hate-life free and will probably end up being annoyingly ranty. Yeah, I'm just going to skip spell-check because I tend to make up words....   Hey, everyone, I have depression and an arthenoid imbalance!!  Just wanted to get that out there, and no, I'm not just a lazy truant, I have to miss a lot of school for these problems. It sucks to not be able to sing (a life passion)anymore and I'm working on getting it back, but please, don't ask me why I was gone the day before because I will mostly just say "sick" because I don't want to cry and tell you all my problems.  Damn it, I'm getting melodramatic.  Thanks, Sara, I stole your idea to blog. I miss you so badly! More than you'd ever be told to your face because my eyes would, um, water a little. God, I'm a bitch for being so resentful about being on different teams. I guess I wouldn't say I'd want to move to Thunder because I really love my new Storm team and I think it's honestly the best level I can compete at as of now but it really does suck to lose a friend. Now my inner picked-on 6th grader is coming out and I don't even feel good enough to be your friend anymore. Uggg, I'm suck a dork.  Hey, I passed my AR test with a 30.8 today! The Lord's Prayer actually worked this time. Yessss....  This is all the typing I can muster right now. I'm an eBay-oholic.  Vicky

      I got my license... hah ha ha ha hah hah. June 14th was my birthday. Do you remember thinking about turning 16 when you were little? I do and it doesn't seem that long ago. When'd I get so freaking old??? My mature facade is crumbing and I just want to hide and hug my mommy. But then there's my car and I love it but how come once you can drive, there's nowhere to go? Now I shouldn't complain but I'm tired of getting older. So much sex and hormones, ugg, when can I be 11 again when being pretty didn't matter? I'm sick of makeup, sick of people being proud of having unsafe sex and too much of it, sick of ignorance, and sick of having absolutely no faith in my generation. I wish everyone would stop thinking of themselves as they are now and would start thinking of their futures and families and the good of the rest of the world. How can one be so inconsiderate to throw garbage out the window? To waste our resources on cars we don't need? To take advantage of our parents' trust and waste the time we still have with them? We don't have much time on this Earth and we shouldn't waste all of it drinking and hooking up. He's not going to like you anymore if you give him oral. Why doesn't anyone seem to understand things like that? We're all looking out too much for only ourselves and I just keep being appalled at the audacity some teenagers have.   I'm sick and tired of it so stop it!

      Lovely. Absolutely lovely. A certain someone's grandma went a tirade and took away the vacation of a certain well-loved person for a completely harmless and unrelated offence. We've already purchased the airfare and can not return it which really upsets our vacation plans. All this drama over nothing and all because G needs to feel important. Selfish bitch. Now, I'm not one to hate but she neglects and emotionally abuses my friend whom I adore and because of it, I want to kill her. To butt into my family's business and punishing us instead of the said friend is absolutely irresponsible. I can't even fathom having the nerve to be so irrational and disrespectful of another family. I'm shaking, I'm so angry. How is this important in the whole spectrum of life? What is this helping? Its not helping anything. Its making people miserable and causing unnecessary trouble. I love my mom. She is sooo kick-ass and has a great letter to send to G in the light of these events. It's beautifully written and asks my friend to vacation with us while backhanding G. Awesome.   I neeeed to get over this!!  Ugg. I HATE people who are selfish, nosy, irrational, self-centered, dramatic, and egotistical. Hmmm, who do you think I'm describing?  Anyone want to make me feel better?

      Hey everyone! I'm at Kellin's house. Yeah, we're having a hot tub party but, uhh -whoa, S just made up a rumor about some people making out that shall remain nameless- oh, yeah, the hot tub jets aren't working.   I got a car today! Its a black 99 VW Bug and its name is Winnebugo. Um, I didn't name it, the lady I bought it from did; I'm not into naming inanimate objects. I sooo feel like THE SHIT driving it!   My birthday is on Monday! I might have a party so, um, IM me!? If anyone actually reads this blog....  School's out! So much stress is off my shoulders! Thank you God!  I have a crush and I think he knows I like him. Heh.  I dunno what to write about. I'm a blabbering idiot. Bye.

      Well, I'm kind of.... content for once. Not much action. Not much drama. Neil's at camp so not much... hahaha. Um, well, I figured out I like to write poems/songs. A sample? It's wearing on me/It's wearing me thin/I try and I fail/Yet I'm too far in/I can't stop the cycle/I can't stop its wrath/But the numbers keep adding/And I do the math. Sorry if you&nbsp;don't know what that was about but I'm not exactly ready to explain it to those who don't. I'm very happy for the upcoming months. I have many, many plans! - Private rock climbing lessons - woot - Start work on my demo - Back to serious vocal training - All-star cheerleading - English and Spanish college courses - American Eagle job (if they hire me?!) Isn't amazing to feel happy again? I feel so adult like I've been through everything that could ever break me down. I have no insecurities or things to hide. I feel ahead of my time. There's no point in worrying, drama, or gossip. Let's just get over ourselves and do something productive for once. Cutest kid in Libby Lu ever today! So much fun. A bunch of 5 year olds and I played Who's Your Boyfriend in the hallway for an hour and we had such a fun time. My little friend, Ashley, decided to tell each guy that came by that he was hot or sexy, especially to the old men. I told her she watched too much TV and she replied with "MTV! Peace Homie!" including an upside down peace sign. Yeah, she was white.

       I hate my job.  It sucks. Really bad. I'm so angry with my employer that I've sent a letter to corprate including a scan of a newsletter given to me by one of my managers. Arhgg! It was terrible; they treat me like a child! These over-glossed, idiotic girls giving me orders to mop the entire store then critizing how I stepped on it, leaving marks, and sending me out to do it again, it drives me crazy! I know I'm the best one with those girls yet I recieve no praise whatsoever because I don't "reach my merch goals." They tell me to give the best parties and experience I can while contradicting that statement by making it clear that we need to be #1 in the company and sell, sell, sell. Who F-ing Cares?! I sure as hell don't! So if I bust my ass and keep us at #1, what do I get out of it? I get a pizza party with a bunch of people I don't like who can't spell. Yes, I'm not kidding. Plus, my managers talk down to the girls ALL THE TIME. Didn't you hate that when you were eight or nine? I know I sure did. My policy is to treat my customers as if they were three years older. I just want to tell my store MATURITY will sell product, not a condensending tone.  LIBBY LU SUCKS!

      but I've been too lazy to say anything. Barbados sucks. Isolated and overprotected, I'd never felt so lonely in my life. I was so excited to come home and I was well-accepted at first but it seems like everything is unfortunately back to normal. How come when I feel completely unethical when I don't console and protect my friends they have only the opposite feelings? It's not fair that I'm constantly aware of everyone else's feelings and don't think twice before backing them up and when the do something nice for me, they expect repayment. It's called friendship! Wake up and stop caring only for yourself. I have feelings too! Why doesn't anyone understand that? I'm so fed up with my girls chosing acceptance over me without any regard to how it makes me cry. I'm done with it. Does anybody want to be my friend?
