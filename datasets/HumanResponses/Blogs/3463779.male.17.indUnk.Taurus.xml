      There is a middle-aged man standing at a filing cabinet, desperately searching for something. He ruins the room. Paper is floating about everywhere, just like the storm of feelings in his mind. He reaches out and takes the file he has been looking for. The look of happiness is shown in the mirror. He reads down and down the page until he reaches the bottom, his face, shot down by the words he reads, and the blood streams down his face like an angry river in summer, and what is left of this broken man is hidden away in his past.   There is a man standing inside a white room with a doctor on the other side, the man is only about 24 or 25, he speaks to the doctor desperately asking to know where he is from. Do I Have A Mother Do I Have A Mother. The question rang out through the doctor’s ears but yet from the look of the doctor’s face he just could not bring himself to tell the man what he had to hear. The man is a finished product, but without knowing how he was made.   There is a young man standing outside, he is only about 16 or 17 the wisdom he believes he has is only matched by his naivety. A summer’s day without even a breeze, a white wooden house much like you see in the movies. Anyway, the young man is dressed in his suit and tie; he looks the part for a new day. The sun has risen and this gives him the confidence to take a step onto the grass. The young man wanders out farther into the garden and in the road near by he sees a small boy. Only about 4 years old but he is laughing while sat inside a small yellow tricycle. All in all it seems like a good day. The young man goes over to the small boy who he knows rather well, he kneels down and kisses the small boy on the cheek, the boy pulls a face and wipes the kiss the off, the young man laughs and smiles. The look of contentment on his face cannot be matched by any other feeling he has, the worlds happiest man.  He walks about 3 metres down the road when a large yellow truck comes speeding past. A pool of red left where the child was, and the young man runs after the truck screaming his life out. Why Why Why. He runs and runs but nothing takes the taste of bitter red out of his mouth.   There is a young boy about 11 or 12 he is waiting outside a shop for his mother, the sparkle in his eyes shows a great joy for life, nothing has ever gone wrong and nothing ever will go wrong. He stands there as all the people walk past, he wonders why the faces of some of the people don’t light up with the dawn of each new day, the confusion though still doesn't manage to bring him down. It has been an hour and the boy is beginning to feel scared, the loneliness among a crowd of people shows ironic smiles inside the faces of all the people around him. His mother returned, but with a bloody face, that screamed out, the scream tore through the boy until he fell to the floor with a red river running through his mind.   There is baby all alone by the riverside, no-one stops to pick it up, no-one even contemplates taking the child home, it is just a piece of flesh that knows no apparent use to anyone. The child doesn't cry and in its mind it feels so magical as it sleeps so slowly, it is obvious to the woman who comes and stand over the child that he will be a great man.   There is an old man standing at the gates of heaven, he is only 40 years old, but yet he is dead inside, what the man feels is locked away inside a deep dark memory, that every day when he wakes up he sees the bloody faces of those he has loved, the lack of any security, the loneliness is something that cannot be filled. Not the smell of baby’s breath, not the taste of fine wine, not the feel of young women’s hair, all of this shows a distant memory of the life he never wanted.  So with his dying breath the man speaks out. What did I do deserve to be born into this world of pain.

      on the rooftop the cars drive by i stare over the edge look at the life below all the uncaring people or at least uncaring towards me and i wonder should i?   people look as they walk past no-one trys to prise me away they'd love to see it happen tell myself this so i can have hope that im noticed yet this is just an empty dream they wouldnt even know  family would grieve for a while but all in good time they'd return to themselves a cheaper life for all concerned i dont want to hurt the one the one who gave me life yet i dont want to hurt myself  but in the house where i learn i have no family to call my own no-one who would say "i wish he was here" they're all laughing at me for my emotional sins each one that fell from my eyes less lifes flowed from within  so as i stand on the brink of destuction i realise that i should stay alive to make people care about me to make people love me to have people near me just so then i can pay them back and put them through the pain i felt  the pain i feel right now make it go away.........please
