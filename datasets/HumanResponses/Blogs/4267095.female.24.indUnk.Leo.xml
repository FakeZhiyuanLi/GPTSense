      Hello Miskas Magic people,  welcome to our own world of Miska Magic where we can all meet and keep the spirit alive. Now that you have returned from the magical forests of Lithuania maybe you have some news from your group which you would like to share with us...or maybe you want to contact someone from the camp. You can do it all here and keep in touch with your new friends from Lithuania, England, Germany, France and beyond... Feel free to use this site to message each other and talk about ways that we can continue our friendship through some scout projects which you would like to develop.  See you in the magic forests.....  Mike
