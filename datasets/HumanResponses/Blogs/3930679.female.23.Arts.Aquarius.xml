      Nick and I have gone to get the actual wedding bands (VERY EXCITING!!!) but I can help but feel sad. All this planning and all this buildup for 1 day. We have been planing for a year and a half.&nbsp; I 'm a little sad thats it's almost over I have to say!  Nick has a new job, at a higher pay grade which is exciting! I am very happy with that. This being said, and I know this is the princess comming out in me I'm a little upset because we have to post pone the honey moon, (TO IRELAND!!!) While it's not being cancled only moved, I'm just bummed because I have had this vision in my head that you leave directly from the wedding to the honeymoon. EVEN though I know this is not the norm it still&nbsp; upsets me a bit.&nbsp; But now we think that we may go over St. Pats which should be fun!  I am still looking for a new job. Selling dance shoes has just about worn out it's welcome. so here I go in to the big bad evil abyss of a ..."REAL JOB"  ok thats it for the day.  &nbsp;

      Ok so I'm finaly Graduating College after 5 and a half years. So what does this mean? It means that I have to get a real Job. and I dont wanna. Ok kids take it from me a degree does not mean any thing!!! A bachlors degree will only get a job that might pay 20,000 a year. ARG!!! Oh well enough griping! I'm gonna try and work on this site a little more today

      I was thinking today about some of the really good teachers that I have had and it's amazing how few there are for instance  2 in college  4 in high School  3 in middle school  2 in elem. School  that's 11 out of probably 70 if you count all of them.  that's kind of sad but good as well that those teachers really made that much of an impact on my life.   In other news, Nick and I had our engagement pictures yesterday they are online now at:   urlLink http://www.kcphoto.com/Wedding%20Clients/JessicaNick/wedding.htm    On a similar note I just got my weight watchers kit. this dosent seem too hard.  Here is the pic of the day     My very first home grown produce!!!

      I just realized I hadn't posted since Friday! Life is busy!  Worked all day Saturday(real job) and Sunday(photography), I just put in a application at UK and all looks good so far! I'm really excited! It's for a Graphic Design Technician&nbsp; Senior in the alumni house! Should be fun! Keep your fingers crossed! I have forty tons of laundry (think Jessica Simpson proportions!) Only problem no second floor to throw it all over! So it piled in my kitchen I may just have to do an art piece for this, I don't think I'm brave enough to take a picture! Things are gearing up for the wedding! Less then 2 months ACK!!! So much to do so little time! Ok back to the laundry!  here's you pic!   &nbsp;      distillery out side of the human resources building for the state employment dept. KY

      Ok yeah I'm a slacker, on the bloging front! Here is your picture  I was pretty proud of this taken with my little cool pix. i've been toying with buying a D100 but they stoped making them wich may be a good thing, and maybe just maybe the price will go down! In other news I went to my first kempo class last night. Pretty fun but I am sore like you wouldent believe. My friend who sugested I go kind of forgot to tell me about the 100 push ups and the 200 crunches. Neither have I done since high school which was 6 years ago!!!!! Now that I am not in school, I am looking for more dance classes to get in shape. So in adition to Kempo and Irish Dance which starts back up soon, I am looking in to a Ballett, Tap, and a Jazz Class. I'm hoping I can be dancing or something 5 nights a week. So thats where Im at. I am busy like EVERY week end until the wedding so I figured I might as well fill up the day as well! Oh yeah and I have 2 web sites that need to be done by monday. So that I can GRADUATE !!!! YEAH I will have a bachlors!!! Ok thats it. Have a nice day!

      So I just got a letter from the  urlLink college of communications  saying that I have completed all requirements for my BA in telecommunications, and that I will receive my diploma in early to mid October! I should be psyched! But no, now I am more depressed! I am in a retail job that I loved because they worked with my school schedule, and that was great. Now however, I am just there, I have no where to go. School is over. It's a strange feeling. Your whole life is planned out for you,  urlLink preschool , urlLink grade school ,  urlLink middle school ,  urlLink high school ,  urlLink college . But after that it's kind of like your an adult make your own decisions! And well I don't wanna! I've put in full time applications but so far have heard nothing. And well I'm scared is this what the rest of my life is to be. I am to grow up and go to a job and come home to my husband and that's it! I'm too young for this! I'm only 23!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now don't get me wrong love nick more then anything and I cant wait to be married to him (September 25,2004 BTW) and I do have other activities, but I feel as though my child hood is just gone. And it happened in a week! What the hell happened! Oh well enough on that, I still have wedding stuff to stress about! My dress wont be in until the last weekend of this month and the brides maids dresses wont be in until 2 weeks before the ceremony! ARG!!!!! ok that's it here's your pic!     I know they are grainy but I still think its an awsome picture. This was from ballet under the stars in woodland park.
