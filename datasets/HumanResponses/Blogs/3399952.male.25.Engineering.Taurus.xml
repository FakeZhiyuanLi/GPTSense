       I have access the the logs of my server and can see that I get a few hits a day from people who somehow find their way to my blog.  I'd really like if some of you lurkers would post a reply or message to some of my posts.  I post things on not only to get my thoughts out, but I'd like to see some response to them too.

       Some kind soul has, for some reason, seen fit to give me a taste of TotalFark.  The only problem with TotalFark is that it will now distract me from everything else in my life.  I think Wendy is already sick of it.  But other than that it's really cool.  I've already done two Fark Photoshops as a TotalFarker and had one do ok and the other is doing pretty well.  I'm gonna start picking and choosing which ones I enter now though, because I don't have the bandwidth that some of the regular Farkers do.

       For some odd reason, that phrase really irks me. When I read 24/7, I  assume  that it is implied they are open 365 days a year.  They could also say 24/365 which would imply that they are open 7 days a week.  It just seems that they are being redundant and that bothers me.  Other inappropriate versions (to make you realize that this is stupid): 24/168/365, 168/52/365, 168/365.  Some maybe appropriate ones would be: 24/7/52, 24/365, 168/52.  Sorry for the rant, but that's what blogs are for, right?

       I haven't posted in a week so I needed to do so today.  I am just about finished reading "Second Foundation" by Asimov.  I think I'm going to the library to get "I, robot" this weekend.  I want to read that before the movie comes out.  I'm not really looking forward to the movie, but since I will probably end up seeing it, I want to be one of those people who can state, "The book is mush better than the movie."  In other news, I think I perferated my eardrum 2 weeks ago in Titusville and I'm going to the MD to check it out tomorrow.  I've also done 3 worth1000 contests lately and look forward to doing some more.   urlLink Here  is a link to my empty trophy mantle, but with links to my 3 entries.  I think I'm definately still a Fark'er at heart, but worth allows me the opportunity to plan my pshops ahead of time rather than rushing them at Fark.  I'm sure eventually I'll end up with a Total Fark account.  I just need more hours in the day.

       Well I noticed a little climb in traffic on my blog from various sites and thought I might try a little harder to add more information.  I also need desperately to clean up my  urlLink main page  and my  urlLink Photoshop page .  That will come soon enough.  I also signed up with  urlLink Worth1000  yesterday to mangle some images with them.  I like that I have time (2 days) to work on an image rather than rushing to get one out the door in an hour or 2.  So I'm currently working on a contest there that I hope to finish tonight.  Afterwards, I'll spend some time making the site more appealing.

Not that I care, unless the bandwidth gets overwhelming.  But a little email with appriciation would be nice.  justin@drunkatgt.com

       This is a call to people who graduated from Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, FL.  I created a page  urlLink here  to try and get back in contact with some of my old high school friends.  It will also serve (once I get people contacting me) as a better way of keeping a Fletch database than classmates.com or any of those other crappy pay for info sites.

       Nothing much to report on since last writing. I took Caden to my parents (Nana and Granddaddy's) house on Sunday and we got to swim. Caden loves the pool. We also wanted to see them before they left town. Wendy, Caden and I get to go stay at their house this weekend and watch our dog, Duke, who has been staying with them while we're stuck in an apartment. It will be nice. Our 4th anniversary is also on Friday, so it will be nice to spend a relaxing weekend together.

       Not much to update.  I've been busy at work and been doing some more photoshops.  I just figured since I haven't updated since June 26.  I don't have anything to rant about now so I'm out.
