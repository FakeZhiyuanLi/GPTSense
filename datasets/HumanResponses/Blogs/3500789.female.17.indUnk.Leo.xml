      I finally finished all my exams. I seriously pray to God I pass all of my courses. Still got many culminating to do, majorly stressed out. After exams today, I bused my ass over to Lee's house, because I have my chemsitry lab pratical exam tomorrow, and I have no clue what the heck I am suppose to do. So I had go to his house for major tutoring and help. The first thing I did, when I entered Lee's house was to go into his room and sprawled out on his bed. I was so tired from my physic exams, my brain was like mush. I quickly fell asleep on his bed, sleeping on Lee's bed is always amazing, and I got to sleep with my favourite and biggest teddybear ever. The moment I woke up from my wonderful beauty nap, Lee had already prepared for me a delicious dinner with fish and coleslaw. With a boyfriend as wonderful as him, what more can a girl possibly want.   Quote: To love and be loved, the foundation of life.

      My very first post, I have finally decided to start a blog after many years of consideration. So many ideas to share, so many things to write, I can’t wait to being.  Even though I was tired and stress out for my physic exam I attended church as usual since it is Sunday. During worship, all I could think of was how I could be spending my time at home studying for physic, because I purely suck at it. As soon as the guest speaker, a Rev. from another church, begin speaking I actually sat up and paid full attention to him, it was as if God wanted me to really listen to the message. The message this Sunday was about Prayers. The sermon was very well done; one thing that truly touched my heart was the story the Rev. told at the end, about a girl was paralyzed after a diving accident, during a sermon the speaker told the girl whoever wants to serve God kneel in prayer with him, and the girl within her heart wanted to kneel so badly except she couldn’t. She silently said a prayer to God, she said, “The day that I will join you in heaven, the first thing I want to do with my new body is to kneel down before you Lord and praise you.” After telling the story the Rev. read the Lord’s Prayer for us, while we prayed and I got on my knees because I was so moved by the story. It was one of the best sermons ever.  This Sunday was interesting I got a chance to talk to many old friends that graduated. It was nice catching up on what’s happening with the people that I have grown up at church with. Talking to church guys about girls are so hilarious, first, they have really high expectations, second, they think they know, but they have no idea. I seem like such a bad influence, since I did so many not so good things. At times, I seem more mature than they are and they 3 years older than me, very scary.  After I got home from church, I talk to Lee after politics, which we always argue about. Then we talked about honeymoon, I realize how much of a kid I still am. Pillow fight on the bed during honeymoon is the best activity ever. LoL  Quote: When we were little, we think we know everything. When we got older, we realize we know something. After decades later, we found out we know nothing.

      June 27th.-> A big  HAPPY B-DAY  to Al. Recount of the 27th: After sleeping in, (sorrie God) I watched TV for a bit. I waited for everyone to come home and just sort of lounged around. After seeing Albert in the kitchen, I remeber it was his b-day and congratulated him. We (family+ah por+Ivan) went to the place and Birchmont and Finch for dinner. The food was very good, I know that because we finished off everything. O yea, in the restaurant we ran into Pastor Ray and his family. Then we had cake. At restaurant they cut the cakes in a really funny way, they would cut the sides first and around, yet they don't cut the cake into wedges. Very weird.   June 28th: Today was movie day. I went over to Lee to watch movies and cuddled. Oy, we watched like 13 going on 30 and Mean Girls. LoL I am turning Lee into a girl with all these chick flicks. Either or, the movies were very cute.  June 29th: I am so  HAPPY . Why? Well I got to spend the whole day with Vanessa. Hehe. We had lunch then we went shopping. It was so fun. I hope I had been able to cheer Vanessa up, because lately she haven't been so happy. She bought a short and I bought a skirt both very cute. We looked at everything at Woodside. Haha. One day trip to Woodside. After that, Vanessa help me pick out clothes for thingy, I like Vanessa's style it is a bit different from mine, but it is a good change from time to time. Thx Vanessa. Seeing that it was a very good day, we sat at the park like good ol'times and just chat it was amazing, swing was a bit dangerous though, I think we are getting too big, then again we could just complain and have the swings resize. =p LoL. I love spend time with Vanessa it is always fun and we never really run out of things to talk about.   Lee: The fight was horrible. I guess the foundation of our relationship wasn't that strong when tested by everyone. Hope this will make our relationship stronger.   Song reflection:  Come Clean Let's go back Back to the beginning Back to when the earth, the sun, the stars all aligned  'Cause perfect didn't feel so perfect Trying to fit a square into a circle Was no lie I defy  Let the rain fall down And wake my dreams Let it wash away My sanity 'Cause I wanna feel the thunder I wanna scream Let the rain fall down I'm comimg clean, I'm coming clean  I'm shedding Shedding every color Trying to find a pigment of truth Beneath my skin  'Cause different Doesn't feel so different And going out is better Then always staying in Feel the wind  I'm coming clean Let the rain fall Let the rain fall I'm coming clean  Let's go back Back to the beginning   June 30th:  A new sunny day. I believe everything will be fine in the end.

      I woke up at like 7.30 this morning, which is a very good timing for school, yet there is no school.  A recount of yesterday's event: I woke up earlier since we had to go back to school to pick up report cards. A very very dreadful thing. I headed to school with Vanessa, (crap, still need to write in that page of hers) we didn't talk much though. Lately, she has been very quiet, maybe she was thinking so I didn't talk about stuff to really bug her, sometimes I am too active for my own good. Once again, I headed back to my homeform, talked to people, and receieved my report card. My mark wasn't as great as I had hope, yet I learned something very valuable this year. After looking everywhere for Adrian, a fellow Simmer, we (Vanessa, Adrian, Sandy, E.K, a korean dude, and I) were off to Fairville Mall. I had always thought was FV was this huge mall, and I would always get lost in it, then again I can't tell my directions within a mall premises. Yesterday, to my amazed eyes, I found that FV wasn't all that big at all. Oy, I am truly stupid and childish for that matter. Always, then we went to watch Shrek, thong joke laughed so hard with Vanessa. *Tears* We continued to wander until both Adrian and I were exhausted. O yea, I bought Lee a present, (its a mug from Disney, shhh, don't let him know). Shortly after, we were tired we left for home. Trip inside Silk and Satin was fun, Vanessa bought like the most non-existent thong I have ever seen. Cute and sexy though, but every see-through. *Gasps* Haha, she even thought to get the feathery ones, very kinky. Hehe. And I ran into Valerie, and her bf. Fun Fun.  This morning, I woke up like this early, (refer to above to exact time of awakeness)so I started web surfing just for fun. I found Vanessa's xanga page, xanga is just like blogging but its called xanga. Very neat. Hehe. I love pokadots. Yep, so I read a little, just the usual stuff.  Hmm... today's plan: I don't have a clear idea. I think I am suppose to head over to Lee's yet I also want to spend time with Vanessa. O well la. Think later. More meaningful quote this time, since I forgot to put one last time.   Quote: You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have truly lived are the moments when you have done things in the spirit of love.

      Wow... so many things happened. Vanessa and I became heros. Lee and I went throught another fight, yet we still are together, which is one of the many reasons I am going to marry him. I went to Stratford to see Macbeth on a school trip, it was amazing, the actors were so professional, it was worth every penny. At startford, I even got my mom a bag. LoL For once I am trying to be a good daughter. Hmm... I got all of Sims, my life is finally completed. (Well... kinda.) I even got Lee addicted to Sims, now that is something.  Lately, Vanessa and I haven't been as close. It has happened before, like we fall out of our closeness, perhaps it was my fault. I feel really bad that we aren't as close as before.I hope I can restore our friendship before it is too late.  Majorly need to get a job, mom is bugging the crap out of me. Why? Why do I have to be so lazy? Bummers.  I did so many things today. I went to Lee's in the morning, talk to Lisa during bus ride, seems like we are building a good relationship. I walked Lee to school, and met a bunch of people, which was totally amazing. I walked myself home, and played Sims because I need to wait for Lee to get out of his exam. Sims is always so damn entertaining, what would I do without Sims. Then the three of us, went to Pickle Barrel to grab lunch. Killer Milkshake is huge, I have never had a milkshake that huge in my entire life, I swear I am so not drinking another milkshake for at least a year. We waddled back to Lee's house to watch Mulan, which apparently Lee never saw. Yep, so we cuddled and watch Mulan. After the movie, we did some other stuff but we were so quiet, so Lisa kind of walked in on us. Haha. The shower was fun. Sims was fun. Talk at Wendy's was serious. I hate rain. And that pretty much sums up the day, and the past bit.

      I think I passed everything. Very happy. Yesterday, the water pipes at the school broke, due to lack of water, bathrooms and health hazards, the school was closed down. Yay. Like seriously you have to wait in line for 20 mins for the bathroom, right. So I ended up sitting on my ass all day, waiting for Lee to get home. And on June 1st, it was one year, but I was kind of too upset to celebrate it. Now I am though. Hehe.  Today, I realize that a lot of my friends are graduating. It is kind of sad because I won't be able to see them that often. But hey, next year will be my last year a high school, that ought to be good. I really don't like change, yet things now aren't the best, there has to be change. Why the hell am I so nostalgic? I just can't help it. Lee got me Sims 8 in 1. Kind of happy, but then that's it. O well, um... after party should be fun. *Thinking* If I have anything else to blab, I'll post again today.  Quote: Refuse to do nothing

      At the moment, I am crying my eyes out so excuse me if I make any typo. Today started out okay, not the best of days but it wasn't bad either. Everything was fine until I got to Chemistry, which was last period. I did well, (even the teacher complimented me) in my L.S. (Living Spaces and Shelter) presentation. I did alright through my in-class essay for English. As soon as it got to Chemistry, it just went from heaven to the deepest corner of hell. First, the people who was going to mark the lab practical was the Gr. 12s. Second, instead of one period like usual of our lab we only got half an hour. Major disadvantages. I thought I knew what I was doing, yet the markers just keep deducting marks like as if the marks means nothing, well, probably to them since it wasn't their markers that are going down the drain. And finally, my results were different from everyone else's, ha, maybe its just my luck.  More oys, tomorrow in homeform, the teacher is going to announce to the whole class what classes you fail so you can apply for summer school. What a blow to your self esteem eh. I can so see myself fail like math and physics. *sobs* First time in my entire life, I am not in the honour roll. *sobs*   Quote: F.R.O.G. (Fully rely on God)

       The quest for the meaning of life:    Some of us thinks that our lives are similar to that of Sisyphus. Poor Sisyphus reaped the displeasure of the gods when he disclosed to mere mortals secrets that were known only within celestial ranks. His sentence consisted in having to roll a massive stone top the top of a hill, watch it roll down again, and repeat the exercise endlessly. His was a life consigned to futility.     &nbsp;   Is our lives really that meaningless? Or are we just looking in all the wrong places for the answer?     &nbsp;   Today was an eventful day. Without knowing exactly what had happened, I was swept into a whirlwind of emotions. For a bit, I had no one to turn to, for the only one I thought I could turn to had already slammed the door in my face. Unexpectedly, I found out that God had already&nbsp;planted mini help buttons all around me, for hard times like this. I guess, God knows me better than I do. As I read&nbsp;the Bible, and did my devotions, my burdens seems to have vanished. Although, sadness still fills my heart,&nbsp;I can only hope for the best, and I know whatever the outcome will be, it is all in God's plan.&nbsp;    The sun came out, is it a sign of comfort and reassurance?&nbsp;     Quote:    "How strange that we call the sexual act "making love" when in actuality, if that act is without commitment, it is a literal and figurative denuding of love in which the individual is degraded to an object. Love is not love when it has been manufactured for the moment. Love is the posture of the soul, and its entailment are binding. When love is shallow, the heart is empty, but when the sacrifice of love is understood, one can drink deeply from its cup and be completely fulfilled. The more we consume love selfishly, the more wretched and impoverished we become."

       FINALLY A CHAIN LETTER THAT I LIKE!     Hello, my name is Basmati Kasaar. I am suffering from rare and deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity,  fear of being kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and  guilt for not forwarding out 50 billion fucking chain letters sent  to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on, then  that poor fucking 6 year old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her  forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed  before her redneck parents sell her off to the traveling freak  show.     Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give you and  everyone you send his email to $1000? How stupid are you? Ooooh,  looky here! If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get  laid by every Playboy Bunny in the magazine! What a bunch of  fucking bullshit.     So basically, this message is a big FUCK YOU to all the people out  there who have nothing better to do than to send me stupid chain  mail forwards. Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come  into my apartment and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing  the chain which was started by Ceaser in 5 A.D. and was brought to  this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower and if it makes it  to the year 2000, it'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records  for longest continuous streak of blatant stupidity.     Fuck them!     If you're going to forward something, at least send me something  mildly fucking amusing. I've seen all the 'send this to 50 of your  closest friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being  will somehow receive a Nickel from some omniscient being'. I don't  fucking care. Show a little intelligence and think about what  you're actually contributing to by sending out forwards. Chances  are it's your own unpopularity.     THE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS:     Chain Letter Type 1:  (scroll down)  > >>  > >>  > >>Make a wish!!!  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>Keep Scrolling  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>No, really, go on and make one!!!  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>Oh please, they'll never go out with you!!!  > >>Wish something else!!!  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>Not that, you pervert!!  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>STOP!!!!  > >>  > >>  > >>Wasn't that fun? :)     > >>Hope you made a great wish :)     > >>Now, to make you feel guilty, here's what I'll do. First of all, if  > >>you don't send this to 5096 people in the next 5 seconds, you will  > >>be raped by a mad goat and thrown off a high building into a pile  > >>of manure.  > >>  > >>It's true! Because, THIS letter isn't like those fake ones, THIS  > >>one is TRUE!! Really!!! Here's how it goes:  > >>  > >>*Send this to 1 person: One person will be pissed off at you for  > >>sending them a stupid chain letter.  > >>  > >>*Send this to 2-5 people: 2-5 people will be pissed off at you for  > >>sending them a stupid chain letter.  > >>  > >>*Send this to 5-10 people: 5-10 people will be pissed off at you  > >>for sending them a stupid chain letter, and may form a plot on your  > >>life.  > >>  > >>*Send this to 10-20 people: 10-20 people will be pissed off at you  > >>for sending them a stupid chain letter and will napalm your house.  > >>Thanks!!!! Good Luck!!!  > >>   Chain Letter Type 2     Hello, and thank you for reading this letter. You see, there is a  starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no arms, no  legs, no parents, and no goats. This little boy's life could be  saved, because for every time you pass this on, a dollar will be  donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless Goatless Boy from  Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund.     Oh, and remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the emails  sent and this is all a complete load of bullshit. So go on, reach  out. Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds.  Oh, and a reminder - if you accidentally send this to 4 or 6  people, you will die instantly.  Thanks again!!   Chain Letter Type 3     Hi there!! This chain letter has been in existence since 1897. This  is absolutely incredible because there was no email then and  probably not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do.  So this is how it works... Pass this on to 15,067 people in the  next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to you like:     *Bizarre Horror Story #1  Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday. She had  recently received this letter and ignored it. She then tripped in a  crack in the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a  drainpipe in a flood of poopie, and went flying out over a  waterfall. Not only did she smell nasty, she died. This Could  happen To You!!!     *Bizarre Horror Story #2  Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail and  ignored it. Later that day, he was hit by a car and so was his  boyfriend (hey, some people swing that way). They both died and  went to hell and were cursed to eat adorable kittens every day for  eternity.   This Could Happen To You Too!!! Remember, you could end up just  like Pinsley and Bip. Just send this letter to all of your loser  friends, and everything will be okay.   Chain Letter Type 4     As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote.  Send it to all your friends.     FRIENDS:     A friend is someone who is always at your side.  A friend is someone who likes you even though you stink of shit,  and your breath smells like you've been eating catfood.  A friend is someone who likes you even though you're as ugly as a  hat full of assholes.  A friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled  yourself.  A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry  about your sad, sad life.  A friend is someone who pretends they like you when they really  think you should be raped by mad goats, then thrown to vicious  dogs.  A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet, vacuums and then gets  the check and leaves and doesn't speak much English...no, sorry  that's the cleaning lady.  A   friend is NOT someone who sends you chain letters because he  wants his wish of being rich to come true.     Now pass this on! If you don't, you'll never have sex ever again!   The point being? If you get some chain letter that's threatening to  leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete  it. If it's funny, send it on. Don't piss people off by making them  feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been  tied to a dead elephant for 27 years, whose only savior is the 5  cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this mail, otherwise you'll end  up like Miranda. Right?     Now Send this to everyone on your email list to prove how Fucking Right i am!  > >>  > >>  > >>  > >>    Cheerz &nbsp;

       The Sims 2 is easily one of the three biggest PC games of the year, in addition to Half-Life 2 and the soon-to-be-released Doom 3. At stake is the future of a franchise that has sold millions of copies but that took a stumble with The Sims Online. The good news is that The Sims 2 looks like it will be a significant upgrade from the original game in every conceivable way; there’s a new graphics engine that allows you to experience every detail of your sims’ lives in intimate detail, as well as a new aspiration system that will give your sims desires that you have to fulfill.     &nbsp;  At E3, EA introduced the aspiration system and showed us how your sims will desire certain things, be it relationships, wealth, family, and more. Maxis executive producer Lucy Bradshaw expanded on this further at today's event. When playing the game, it will be important to keep your sims happy by making sure that their aspirations are being fulfilled. For example, relationship sims will want to flirt, kiss, and have fun, and they’ll be depressed if you deprive them of companionship.    &nbsp;  Each sim will have an aspiration meter indicating how fulfilled he or she is. The meter is tiered, so there are multiple levels of fulfillment. The upper two tiers are labeled gold and platinum. If you can reach a gold level of fulfillment, your sim will earn points that can be used to purchase special rewards that can make your life easier. Some of these include the money tree, which you can harvest every now and then for extra cash; smart milk, which you can give children to drink so they learn skills faster; and cool shades, which are art-deco lamps that help you make "friends" faster, in a romantic way.     &nbsp;  The highest level of fulfillment is platinum. If you reach this, you’re not rewarded with points, but instead your sim is given a boost in his or her abilities. For example, a relationship sim who has been having trouble romancing another sim will now have a good chance of sweeping that sim off his or her feet. The aspiration meter slowly empties over time, so this effect won't last forever.     &nbsp;  Bradshaw showed us the three different neighborhoods that will ship with the game: Pleasantown, Strangeland, and Veronaville. Not only does each neighborhood have a unique appearance, but each will come with a backstory of its own.     &nbsp;  Perhaps the most familiar neighborhood is Pleasantown, where Mortimer Goth of the original game has settled down. It's 25 years later, and Mortimer is an old and wealthy man. He's single, as well, since the infamous Bella Goth took off under mysterious circumstances. Cassandra Goth is now grown up, and she has a little brother, Alexander, who was born to Mortimer and Bella shortly before Bella's disappearance. In addition to the Goths, there’s a pair of fraternal twin sisters who live in the neighborhood, and each is looking to marry Mortimer for his money.     &nbsp;  Strangeland is a desert town that invokes an Area 51-style atmosphere, mainly because there tend to be a lot of alien abductions and UFO sightings in the area. Strangeland is the home of General Grunt and his two sons, Tank and Buzz. General Grunt (as his name suggests) is in the military, and he’s highly suspicious of the strange goings-on in the neighborhood. He has a tendency to stay up late and look through his telescope at the night sky, and he eyes his neighbors, the Smiths, warily. The head of the Smith family is Pollination Technician 9, who has blue-green skin and buglike eyes. PT9 just wants to settle down in the suburbs with his wife and two kids and live a normal middle-class life.     Lastly, there’s Veronaville, which promises a Romeo and Juliet-style setting, thanks to the presence of the Capps and Montys families. Of course, there’s an attraction between one of the Capps kids and one of the Montys kids, which should set up plenty of tension.     &nbsp;  Bradshaw says that in addition to providing some content, these neighborhoods will also offer players an idea of what they can create in the game themselves. Players can build their own neighborhoods, limited pretty much only by their imaginations.    &nbsp;  According to Bradshaw, the game went feature-complete shortly after E3, and the developers are now busy polishing the game and building up some of the player content, including sims that will ship with the game. She also showed us some of the 19,000 user-made sims for The Sims 2 that have been created, thanks to the Sims 2 Body Shop utility that was released earlier this year.

       After last night's argument, I slept till about 11 this morning, Lee came over shortly over to pick me up for lunch. We headed out west hoping for some Thai, it turns out that the Thai restaurant was closed on Saturdays during lunch hour, stupid idea if you ask me. Since we were in a plaza, where there&nbsp;are other restaurants, we walked around searching for another place to get food. As a Chinese, obviously I wouldn't go for white people Chinese food, like my mom could cook better than that, so we decided to try this restaurant called the North Restaurant. Thinking that&nbsp;it was a common English restaurant, we&nbsp;headed in. Little did we know that the restaurant serve Persian food,&nbsp;and we were in for a surprise. I was trying to be optimistic about this so I&nbsp;told Lee&nbsp;that it would be a good experience. How ironic, it was the total opposite.&nbsp;I ordered a vegetarian plate, and Lee ordered a lamb plate. Before&nbsp;the food arrived, we got a plate of onions, butter,&nbsp;and pita,&nbsp;Lee and I were so confused as to what to do with them. I swear the Persian family across from us was probably laughing at us.&nbsp;When the food arrived I received a plate of rice&nbsp;(ucky white people rice), and a plate of green mushy stuff, and Lee got a plate of rice and burnt lamb and two&nbsp;burnt red thingy, which later we discovered was a tomato. In conclusion, it was the worst food ever, and it cost us  forty  bucks. And we left the restaurant full from how bad the food looked.     Lee's Complaint and Warning:  Dear Consumers,    North is possibly the worst restaurant in existence. The service was slow, the food was awful, and it was very expensive. My lamb and tomatoes were burned, the rice was dry and tasteless, and the torshi tareh (the vegetables) both looked and tasted like duck turd. It took us 5 minutes just to get the waitress' attention, and she barely spoke English. The food was vulgar. It was so vile I would not feed it to a dog. Both the presentation and the taste were awful. It was so horrible, I was forced to vomit when&nbsp;I  &nbsp;got home. I can understand why Osama Bin Laden is upset with eating this shit everyday. The lack of sunlight and the atrophication of muscles in caves decreases the amount of endorphins in your body. Endorphins make you happy, and the lack of it combined with this shitty food, it is no question why he is as pissed off as he is. Well at least we got to eat authentic shitty terrorist food today. I would not even force it upon those terrorist prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Wait a second, they are terrorists, I guess it is home cooking. Anyway, apart from the vile, disgusting, nasty, vulgar, ugly, awful, bad, despicable, horrible, terrible, shitty ass food, it was expensive.&nbsp;If I didn't&nbsp;paid shit for shitty food, I wouldn't be so upset, but I work hard to take care of Tiffany, and I have to budget about $60.00 a day to take care of her. Not only did the nasty ass terrorist food take a hit on my stomach, it took a hit on my wallet, and for that I am very upset. In short, Persian food really, really sucks, and the proprietors of the North Restaurant should go back to Tehran, strap some dynamite on themselves, and blow themselves up for the greater good. Really.     Quote: "Marge! Look at all this great stuff I found at the Marina. It was just sitting in some guy's boat!"     Advice to the North Restaurant: "If something is too hard, give it up. The moral my boy is to never try anything."

       Whoa... I never realized how much crap was in my possession. For some strange reason I woke up at like 6.30 this morning, the sun was barely up in the sky, maybe I just needed to go pee. Anyways, since Lee didn’t get up early enough, we didn’t go downtown with Darryl and “BumQue” to pick up their T-cards, Lee just popped over to my house to help me clean out/up my room. We were suppose to clean up my room since like a while ago, yet we kept procrastinating so finally we did it today. We started to clean my room around 3 p.m. after we grabbed lunch at sushi place. Cleaning my room was like a journey through my life. I am like a trash lady because I kept everything. It took us a good 3 hours to clean and vacuum my room, but there is still little bits here and there to finish tidying. Oy. At least now my room is actually neat and not like a dumpster. We played Theme Hospital at Lee’s. Lee’s bed is so comfy should have just fallen asleep. * Yawns *  &nbsp;  Things to complete:  ~  Plan Party Stuff   { }  ~  Summer Camp Meeting   { }  ~  NLS   { }  &nbsp;  Song Reflection:   Hold You, Kiss You, Love You       You're lookin' at me     Like the first time we met     I can tell that you're needing     That feeling you get when i     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Hold you, kiss you, love you     So darlin' surrender     Right here in my arms     Love will be waiting     Wherever we are when i     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Just close your eyes     And i'll take you away     Let go of everything     Whisper my name when i     Hold you, kiss you, love you  &nbsp;  Like i do     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Just close your eyes     And i'll take you away     Let go of everything     Whisper my name when i     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Like i do     When tangled sheets     In the dark of the night     I'll wake you up in the     Sweet mornin' light when i     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Just close your eyes     And i'll take you away     Let go of everything     Whisper my name when i     Hold you, kiss you, love you     Like i do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

       Saturday &amp; Sunday:    I love Winx Club. Saturday morning cartoon is the best, I know I am not a kid any more, but how can anyone not live off of cartoons?? I spent saturday morning just lounging around the house and watching cartoons. After lunch, I waited for Lee to get back from the boat, so we can go to bbq together. Soon Lee came, picked me up and headed to Sunnybrook Park. When we got there, we got together with Clarence and people. Unfortunately, Lee was out all day in the sun, and he wasn't feeling too well therefore we left early. At night, he stayed over at my house so he could come to church with me in the morning.&nbsp;Too many jokes at church,&nbsp;haha Pastor Ray. A&nbsp;dot of white in a sea of yellow. (It&nbsp;sounds like a marshmellow in a tub of pee.)&nbsp;We went to dim sum for lunch. Finally, Lee got to experience chinese people dim sum, instead of white people dim sum. We headed to Lee's house after dim sum, rolled on to his bed. I think food has this effect on everyone: it makes one sleepy, very sleepy. Not long after, we were both konked off in our own little dream world.    My dream was about me in The Amazing Race, at first this black guy and I was a team, and we then we did all kinds of crazy stuff. Then all of a sudden I was in a team with this blonde chick, I think she was hot. Anyways, so like we also did all kinds of stuff too. LoL And then Lee woke up so he woke me up too. It was around 7 when we woke up, and the sun was still out. We so had to take a shower, we were seriously sweaty and adhesive. I swear put Lee and I together just give it time and we would be stuck together like crazy glue. Talking on the bed soaking wet was fun. LoL    Incident on the Bed:    We were just talking on the bed and I started to name Lee's thingy Dicky. Yes, it wasn't original, I am sorrie, brain is on holiday just like the rest of me. Anyways, he was like Emilie&nbsp;(Lee's ex) called it John, but it doesn't look like a John, it looks like a Ralph. So I was like I like Lisa. And we just bursted out laughing because Lee's sister's name is Lisa. Bad joke...    Soon we realized we were starving and we were talking to Ben online. (A super crazy voice actor friend of ours.) We invited him to come along to eat with us, so we picked him up and headed out across the city to Wendy's.&nbsp;lmao So many crazy jokes in the car. BOMB THREAT!!! rofl    Thx Ben for all the fun and excitment. There is never a dull moment with you.    Love my munchkin. LoL. Thx for din din.

       Um...Some people were asking me what I did for  Lee's B-day , so here it is.  Well, I got up and wrapped his present. And I talked on the phone with him, until I finally got ready headed out to his place. I swear walking in his neighbourhood on a Saturday is not fun, especially since I am a Christian (I wore a cross too) and being Chinese is definitely not cool. Those people with their suction cups, hats, beard, and their wife with way too may kids, (sidewalk hoggers) are all like giving me looks. And it is not like I walked over their kids or something, so damn racist or "religionist". I finally make it alive to his house, I think Lee was worry about it too. So I gave him his present, and we chilled for the rest of the afternoon. Nearing dinner time, we went to this lobster place for dinner with his family and grandma. Is it just me or is people still giving me looks?? People, don't be a Christian Hater, I'll sue you all. *Evil Laughter* Anyways, Lee was paranoided throught dinner because he kept saying how the guy across the room was checking me out. *Cough* Right... Anyways, food was delicious, gotta go back. I was so stuffed by the end of it, I guess I wasn't the only one stuffed. (The lobster was stuffed too.) Afterwards, we had cake with all 18 candles, CRAZY, soon enough we will all be eating wax instead of cake. Lee's grandma also made some brownies. I personally am not a big fan of brownies so I sorta lied about how&nbsp;good it was, I am not saying it bad, it is great but I am just not a brownie person. Okie, I am digging myself in a hole. Haha, yes, dinner was a great accomplishment for me because I sat beside Lee's grandma, she is one of the most straight forward person I have ever met, if she doesn't like you, she'll tell you straight in the face, and I manage to stay on her good side. I am so glad I know like a teeny bit about everything, because with my making up stuff on the spot skill I was able to carry out a good conversation with her, and she likes me. Sweet. I guess my effort of trying to fit into the family finally paid off. Keke. Gotta give myself a pat on the shoulder. =)     My Gorgeous Sexy Boyfriend:    Haha. The other day after Lee drove me home, as usual we lounged on the sofa and just chat. He sat on one end of the couch facing me and I sat on the other end facing&nbsp;him, and we were just chatting while he gave me a foot massage. All of a sudden, while I was just looking at him, he put his hands behind his hand and did this whole model pose thingy. My heart just skipped at beat. I was like O MY GOSH, I so need a camera cuz you look so damn sexy. I swear under the right lighting, and angle Lee looks just like a model if not better. His eyes just got the right shade of grayish blue making him look totally soulful, as if he was deep in thought and just happened to look so good. Or he has this boyish look, which is totally cute yet sexy at the same time, and you wonder is he thinking about something naughty or just something funny. Or if you look at him right when he wakes up, he looks so lost. And then all of sudden when he is about to stretch or yawn, he looks like a super adorable kitten. So cute. LoL My goal is to so get a camera and just take so many photos.     &nbsp;   MACs (the convenient store):    Lately, I have noticed something weird. People around Lee's area likes to hang out at MACs. After spending a day with Lee, at night upon returning to my house, we often would like to drop my MACs to pick up a coke and some gummies to munch on for the drive back to my house. And we often find many teenagers hanging outside and inside the store. Never in my life had I seen a long line up at MACs at 11 p.m. yet one of these night there was a 3 minute line up, and that was the longest amount of time I had ever spent in a MACs. Has MACs become the place to hang out? Is it the place to be for teens of today?? I guess I will never know. But eww who&nbsp;has no life to hang out at MACs, jewish teens are weird, or they seriously need a life or something. Conclusion: Fruity people likes to hang out at MACs.     &nbsp;  Song Reflection:     Drama Queen (That Girl)     There was a girl I knew who always wanted to be the one to stand out from the crowd     Always believed that she was gonna live her dreams     That what when down was gonna come around      For all the doubters, non-believers, the cynicals that once were dreamers     One of these days you'll open up your eyes     And you'll realize       &nbsp;   That girl was a one time teenage drama queen     A hot, tough everyday wannabee     But she'll have changed her destiny     Now she's a somebody     That girl was a wild child dreamer but she found herself'     Cause she believes in nothin' else      And you'll look back and you won't believe     That girl was me       &nbsp;   Armed with an attitude that she knows how to use     She's gonna get there any way she can     Now she knows what she wants     No one is gonna stop her     Nothing's ever gonna hold her down     For all the doubters, non-believers the cynicle that once were dreamers     One of these days you'll know that you were wrong (who would know)     &nbsp;   That girl was a one time teenage drama queen  A hot, tough everyday wannabee  But she'll have changed her destiny  Now she's a somebody  That girl was a wild child dreamer but she found herself'  Cause she believes in nothin' else  And you'll look back and you won't believe  That girl was me       &nbsp;   Life is a work of art- you gotta paint it colorful     Can make it anything you want     Don't have to stick to any rules     You don't need a high IQ to succeed in what you do     You just gotta have no doubt just believe in yourself       &nbsp;   Doubters, non-believers, once were dreamers     One of these days you'll open up your eyes     And you'll realize       &nbsp;   That girl was a one time teenage drama queen      A hot, tough everyday wannabee      But she'll have changed her destiny      Now she's a somebody      That girl was a wild child dreamer but she found herself'      Cause she believes in nothin' else      And you'll look back and you won't believe      That girl was me   &nbsp;

       Woah...it has just been a few days since I updated, yet I have just discovered my posting page is all upgraded and all these buttons and everything, it is absolutely amazing. LoL More buttons for me to fool around with. Keke.  &nbsp;   Truth Vs. Lies:   The truth, can it be lies too?  The truth, to a point it maybe not be the truth anymore, so does it qualify as a lie then?  Doesn't a lie eventually become true?  A matrix theory: What is may not be it.  Truth, it is really facts? Or are the truths just our own opinions?  For example, if you are telling the truth yet the other person doesn't believe you, at that instant does it become a lie?  Fights after fights, it felt as if our relationship was built on&nbsp;sand without a fortify foundation. So many things were said, which pierced both our hearts over and over again. The pain and the tears, never in my life did I feel so vulnerable. I guess this is what love is about, to put everything you ever had on the line, and just hope for the best. Love, so many variables, the outcome is always a mystery. One good thing that came out of the fight was that we missed the rain. The fight wasn’t a good fight because we didn’t exactly solve the problem; due to the physical damage it was doing to the both of us. Lately, I found out that I am really not worth anything. My self-esteem and my confidence just drop from being able to be me to being a cheap crappy whore. So sad… It was a definite rude awakening.  &nbsp;   Resolution:   After the fighting and sleepless nights, we finally reached the root of all problems. It wasn’t something that we can change with a click of the finger. So much more hurtful things were said, I felt like I was one of the contestants in like “The Bachelor” or “For Love or For Money”, everything was at stake. Since we are both relatively reasonable, we came up with a compromise. It feels so good now that we are still together, our love stronger than ever. And then there is the dune buggy rampaging through the aisle running people over.  &nbsp;   Wednesday:     Lately I have been doing some accounting stuff for my mom. And I thought I could get away from math in the summer I guess I was wrong. I haven’t been eating much lately; according to Lee if the wind got any stronger I would be blown away. I seriously don’t think I am that thin, although if I had taken NLS right now I wouldn’t pass it just because I seriously don’t have the chub/fat to rescue anyone else let alone rescue myself. After getting into a bit of a fight with Tim’s mom (Why am I in a fight with all these people? That isn’t a good sign.) I decided to skip dinner, yet later Lee came over. (That was before our fight, because fight was Thursday and Friday night. Wednesday was sort of like the calm before the storm.) And we went to Destiny for food and bubble tea.  Today I was supposed to do stuff with Vanessa, yet when I called her house at like three in the afternoon, Sam (Vanessa’s younger sister) was like Vanessa is still sleeping. I was like wow that is crazy. So in the end we just talked on the phone for a bit which was still cool.  &nbsp;   Thursday:   My BUM day, I didn’t do anything except talked on the phone with Lee and talked on the phone with Vanessa. And then I fought with Lee and didn’t sleep till like 5 in the morning, and was woken up at like 9 a.m. seriously, lack of sleep is killing me.  &nbsp;   Friday:     I had some stuff to take care of near noon, and due to weather and money issues; I ended up not going to the zoo. I hope all you guys who went had tons of fun. After Lee finished doing his work, and I did my stuff, I met him at Finch. It was the first time seeing him after our fight. Things returned to normal, we joked around and fooled around, good times. On the bus, I saw Andrew Le from our school, the skater punk guy. I thought his name was like Jason, I swear teaching little kids every summer is making me very bad with names. Anyways, the only reason we talked was because he was having a nosebleed and I lend or gave him a tissue. Lee and I both wondered why he was on the Steeles West bus all the way across the city by himself. O well, none of my bees wax. Anyways, since we were both hungry we grabbed some sushi for lunch, and yes Sapporo has spoiled us. Damn, can never go back to the way it was before. After stuffing our tummies, we rolled ourselves to Lee’s house where we quickly slumped on to his bed and cuddled. Being so close to him after fighting is so weird, but so romantic and sweet at the same time. It was so intimate and loving. Eventually we fell asleep in each other’s arms. We were woken up by Downtown by Petula Clark. Apparently, Lee’s explained to me that his mom was suspicious we were doing something funny in the bedroom, and it was her way of trying to flush us out of the room with loud music. Yet she did not realize we were trying to catch up on sleep, and Lee being a light sleeper woke me up too. I am such a deep sleeper the only thing that could possibly wake me up are gunshots, screams, and thunder and lightning. But Lee was moving around (a lot), his bed isn’t one of those beds on TV with Richard Simmons, so the person sleeping beside Lee a.k.a. me was quite disturb so in the end we just listened to Lisa and his mom’s bad singing and just laugh. We spend the rest of the evening cuddling and watching a few hours of TLC and Jeopardy with Ken Jennings. In conclusion, I would say today is a very good day.      Quote:     Relationship is like a rose, How long it lasts, no one knows; Love can erase an awful past, Love can be yours, you'll see at last; To feel that love, it makes you sigh, To have it leave, you'd rather die; You hope you've found that special rose, 'Cause you love and care for the one you chose.

      Its sad when your boyfriend got bigger boobs than you.  (NO, I am not talking about Lee and I.)  S.I.T.  Sluts In Training.  (Copyright July 14th 2004. A Lee Tarnow Original.)  July 14th: After doing some work in the morning, I headed out across the city to Lee's. As usual we acted like as if we were married. Guess what we did? We went to the grocery store and picked up some grape juice, and strolled around the mall. Upon leaving the mall, we drove ourselves to the gas station to fill up on gas. After filling up the tank, we went back to Lee's and watch Stepford Wives. In between the movie, Lee's mom made us some lunch at 3 in the afternoon, when we finished eating Lee's mom started to tell me stories of Lee's childhood. I gotta say, some weird stuff happened alrite. Haha, Lee was so embarrassed. Very cute. We did more lounging around the house after the movie was finished, and I had chinese ( white people chinese food ) with Lee's mom and Lisa. It was so weird kinda.   Stepford Wives: It was a relatively funny movie. It started out great, a great opening and everything flowed together. As the movie progress, you will kinda start to get lost. It will still be funny but you would start thinking to yourself like,"What the ...?" And then the end was just confusing, maybe I am just stupid but 3 other people agreed with me. So you make up your mind.    Cuddle Bears : The cuddle bear is the wily prey of the common horny male. A much prized creature, the cuddle bear is at the constant mercy of these horny males. The majestic mammal's sole defense, however, is a formidable one. The Cuddle Bear's toothline is mounted with two large fangs, which she bears at the slightest of threat. When capturing a cuddle bear in the wild, the hunter must be careful of these incidious incisors, lest he be cut to pieces!

      Whale Calling in the car is one of the most entertaining activities of all time.   Its especially funny when you punch it in the balls and he goes "keke that tickles."  Girls, when being with a guy never ask, "Why is it so long?" Because the guy will not be able to answer your question.   Toes are very entertaining during a car ride especially when you can do a TOES UP to the other cars or pedestrians.   When ordering a Wendy's Mandarin Chicken Salad, always ask them to hold the chicken, even though they may be rummaging through your salad.   Lately: I have been able to spend more time with Vanessa. I did a lot of stupid yet funny stuff with Lee. I'm actually able to enjoy my summer without too much interference from my mother. I think my life is pretty balance with everything, I am happy. I guess thank God for everything.   Spidy 2 with friends: July 9th http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=nthtodo

      Apology:  I guess this is my apology to Vanessa, my best friend in the whole wide world, that I am really really sorry for making her upset for the past bit. The above time was the exact time I received the email where Tim invited us all to go see Spiderman 2. Yet on July 3rd, I was invited to a birthday party, unknowingly the birthday boy bought tickets for all those invited to go see Spiderman 2. I am really really sorry. I know that Vanessa and I are sometimes really different people, maybe that is one of the many reasons we became best friends in the first place. Fot the past bit, I cried much more often because I haven't been able to spend as much time as I would like with my best friend. I truly think that friends are treasures, I value them over my life. Right now I just hope that Vanessa and Lee would just get along, and not hate each other, because at my wedding, I want the two people that I love the most in my entire life to be able to share in the joy that I have with both of them.   Quote: A friendship can weather most things and thrive in thin soil; but it needs a little mulch of letters and phone calls and small, silly presents every so often - just to save it from drying out completely. (I am sorry Vanessa, I haven't been doing that often enough.)  Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything.  True friends stab you in the front. (That was just cute, like something Vanessa and I would joke about.)  A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same.  The real test of friendship is: Can you literally do nothing with the other person? Can you enjoy those moments of life that are utterly simple? (Deep)  The only way to have a friend is to be one.  Hugs(0) and Kisses(X) to all my friends.

      Wasserman B-day Party: Lee came over first thing in the morning to pick me up to head back across the city to meet some of the most boring people on the face of the earth. It was Wasserman's B-day. Lee and I grabbed some food on the way to the Promenade. Finally, arriving at the entrance of Rainbow I finally meets some of Lee's friends, such as Tani, Helen, Sharon, etc. It was fun to see Noam again. We went to see Spiderman 2, after Spiderman we headed over to Wasserman's to eat. After eating, some people just played the original Mario on Nintendo. It was so boring, so part of the time, I just chatted with Ian and threw stuff at his crotch. After being bored for about a few hours, I told Lee to leave because I was just falling asleep. The two of us headed back to Lee's place just to rest up before the trip home. When we got back to Lee's we just chilled and played, instead of resting. On the way home, we were starving therefore we bought Wendy's and ate it at my house. I guess the day wasn't that boring after all.   Spiderman 2: For those that are going to see Spiderman 2 on Thursday, I won't say anything to ruin it for you guys, just don't have high expectations. I guess it was better than the first one, yet I swear I have never been so not entertained at a movie. I spend a good portion of the movie in the bathroom, walking around getting food, and saying hi to Evan. It was so predictable, and just plain boring so to speak. Good thing I didn't have to pay for the movie, otherwise so getting a refund.   Meeting: After church on Sunday, a bunch of us who are helping out with the summer program was at a meeting. We were so efficient it was funny. I was sitting next to Syl. and like Viv and Sam came in together. *wink wink* (haha, j/k) I think Viv has a crush on Sam, than again I think every girl except me likes Sam more than just a friend. Why except me? Well duh, I love Lee, otherwise I wouldn't be dating him. Anyways, I think Viv doesn't like me that much, either or, they like fought we was going to sit beside me. Haha, I am popular. It was so weird like most of the time, it was just Sam and I talking, ewww. LoL. Uh oh... Viv turning into green-eyed-monster, seriously what is so good about Sam anyways?? And like after the meeting, Sam was kind enough to drive me home. Keke (I was alone in the car with Sam. *faints* j/k) It was nice just talking to him, he is like a big bro to me, I definitely treasure his opinions.   Monday:  Happy B-day Ah D!!  Lee came over, learned stuff for calc. so boring. Anyways, we got hungry so we went to Milestones and grabbed lunch. After lunch, we went to see the Notebook. Since it was my dad's b-day we went to get him a card. LoL. Card shopping was fun. We eventually headed home, the ride home Lee accidentally elbowed me in the cheeks, and we bursted out laughing our heads off. We just keep laughing all the way back to my house. We played Jeopardy online for the entire evening, both of us collectively don't have a life. Sad. We played it so much, we started to memorize the answers because the topics repeat. We had Sushi for dinner, and noodles for midnight snack. And I finally got Lee home by like 1:30. It was a very long and fun day.  (Lee doesn't like Ryan Philippe, and I thought he was relatively good looking just a little bit scrawny.)   The Notebook: I know, I know... the story is predictable, but I was entertained. The actors both Canadian, it was amazing. The acting was incredible. It is one of those movies, you either grab your boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/husband to go see, it is so sweet and romantic. A good tear jerker, also the cinematic is very well done. Overall, just a nice little movie for you to enjoy.

      Some people in my life, are just live ruiners. (Well, they only ruin my live.) For example, Tim's mom, what is her rule about not letting me sleep over, it makes no sense and all it is doing is causing me to be without friends, because I can't go to anyone's party. I swear, my birthday is in 23 days, and no one, absolutely no one will show up at my birthday party. Also, I probably won't be ever be invited to anything at all.  If anyone one puts their mind to it, they can be utter cruel. So can I.  Quote:That man can destroy life is just as miraculous a feat as that he can create it, for life is the miracle, the inexplicable. In the act of destruction, man sets himself above life; he transcends himself as a creature. Thus, the ultimate choice for a man, inasmuch as he is driven to transcend himself, is to create or to destroy, to love or to hate.

      July 1st:  Happy Canada Day! 26 days till my b-day.  I was out all day with my parents and my mom's friend, whom I kind of remembered. We went to Cullen Gardens and Miniature Village. The place is so picturesque, it would be wonderful to have my wedding there. *wink wink* We spend all day there, I even went on the pony ride, I think I look cute on the pony. LoL After heading back to the city, we went to Market Village and Pacific Mall. I met up with Lee because Tim's mom invited Lee for dinner as a early celebration for his birthday. So, the six of us went to the Mongolian place for dinner. After dinner we went to Main Street to watch fire works. Overall, it was a very fun yet tiring day.   July 2nd:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEETHEART! (LEE)   Quote: I have no money, no resources, no hopes. I am the happiest man alive.

       I was reading something today that was given to me at church, which inspired my title for this blog. Life is a puzzle; we are all trying to finish our puzzle. We search for different things in life such as religion, love, goals, and others, just like how we try different puzzle pieces trying to see which one fits with the other. In the end, when all the puzzle pieces come together forming a complete picture, we will have created a masterpiece.  You.         Sunday:        With only 4 hours of sleep, I ushered for the English Worship. Then we had a discussion/debate about homosexuality for Sunday school. Fun. LoL. After Sunday school, I helped Derek and John traced the  HUGE  map of Canada. The conversation during the tracing was funny.  “Hey Derek, your head is in the way.” “Crap, the map is falling off the wall.” “AHHH… Your shoulder is blocking me.”  Rofl. Crazy. Soon, my dad came to church, picked up Tim and me, and dropped off me home. Later that afternoon, Lee came over after going to Dim Sum with Lisa and Zenon, to go for dinner with me. I seriously would make such a bad farmer, stupid weeds. Not weed,  WEEDS , the plants that are bad for your garden. It was so funny, Lee and me were walking to his car, and these 5 little girls were like they are so dating. And they were making commentaries as we got in the car and stuff. It was so weird. I think they just need a boyfriend. So we head back out west to Lee’s because we both feel like spaghetti, and because Lee bought  GREEN TEA ICE CREAM , which I really want. We sat in the TV room to eat and watch TV. According to Lee, I made the cruelest ( meanest ) comment  EVER . I really didn’t think so, but whatever. We spent the evening watching TV and ate ice cream. O yes, and I invented Mr. Penis-Head. LoL.       Monday: (Today/Yesterday)       Lee called me first thing in the morning and woke me up. He was at my house shortly after. We chilled on my bed for a bit, just playing around and tickling each other. We also looked at some South Park stuff, which was pretty funny. As usual we head back to his house, and grabbed lunch. When we got to his house where there was AC, we just laid on his bed with a fan on for a good 15 minutes just to cool our systems down. We ate lunch and watched The People’s Court. There are just too many funny stupid people suing the crap out of each other. At around 3.30ish, we headed to Lee’s grandma’s apartment because he had to fix Rosemary’s computer. ( A lady who lives at the same apartment building, who always have computer problems. ) And I went to swim with Lee’s grandma. I loved the water; it was great to be swimming again. Afterwards, Lee’s grandma made us dinner, which was quite delicious. After dinner, Lee and I headed out for some ice cream and a movie on Yonge. We got free ice cream because we got coupons, and then we went to Empress to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. We grabbed Wendy’s on the way back to my house. LoL. So now I am home. =)       Harold and Kumar go to White Castle:       It is a super hilarious movie. There were so many topless girls in that movie. It is absolutely insane. LoL. A must see for the summer. There were too many jokes, it definitely kept me laughing all the way through the movie. Also, for those that like perverted stuff, major dirty jokes. It was so wrong, so gross, and yet so comical.        An article I found:         You Must Remember This        A kiss is still a kiss unless you have all your friends and family standing by.    Then, depending on your smooching technique, the kiss merits a collective sigh, a photo opportunity or a story that will haunt you the rest of your married life.    Weddings are made for puckering up, and it starts with those memorable words, "You may now kiss the bride."    And yes, how you lock lips does make a difference, say the lip savvy.    "As a former wedding singer, I've witnessed dozens - if not hundreds - of wedding kisses," says Julia Sullivan, a writer and organizational consultant.    "The key principle is this: Your parents are watching you. Give the most loving kiss you feel comfortable with under their scrutiny," Sullivan says.    Too little contact will have your guests talking, as will too much. Avoid both the peck on the cheek and tongue wrestling, says Sue Fox, owner of Etiquette Survival.    "I recommend erring on the formal side and being classy," says Fox, who regularly consults with business companies about appropriate manners.    Although you know how to kiss - it's pretty difficult to get this far in a relationship without some lip skills - Fox recommends you discuss the all-important moment with your partner before the wedding.    "A lot will depend on the couples' personality," says Fox, author of "Etiquette for Dummies" ((Wiley Publishing, Inc., 1999).    "Open-mouthed, no tongue is probably the way to go. A kiss that lasts between 10 and 20 seconds 'looks right' to most observers," says Sullivan.    And for those who want to get a rise from the onlookers, Sullivan offers this cautionary observation:    "In my experience most of the people who did the big, sexy smooch thing at the altar were divorced within five years."        The Pucker Effect          The wedding twosome aren't the only ones kissing at the ceremony. During this joyous time you may find lips coming at you from all directions. Etiquette guru Sue Fox offers some tips on who and how to kiss.        The social kiss:  "In the art of the social kiss the person who is the recipient is in control. You can slightly turn a cheek, or put a light hand on someone's shoulder if you don't want a kiss," she says.       No kiss:  It isn't appropriate to kiss or hug someone you haven't met before. But if you've bonded during the wedding you may exchange hugs goodbye at the end of the event.       Air kisses:  They're best left to celebrities. They look phony, says Fox.       That's it for now. Lots of Love.

         Thursday: FUN DAY DT    I got woken up at 9.30 in the morning because my mom had requested my assistance to help her to solve a computer thingy for her work. My brain was seriously dead, probably that was the reason why my mom, Tim and I all laughed for a good 15 minutes about our toes. Crazy. When my brain actually started to work, I remembered I had to be at Lee’s house by noon. I quickly rushed into the shower then out my house, on the TTC, went across the city to Lee’s. When I got to Lee’s, Ian was already there with his newly bleached   blonde-ish   hair. You must be wondering why I am doing all this; well today we planned to go downtown with Ian to pick up his T-Card. The three of us chilled at Lee’s, waiting for Lee’s dad to come home so we can get a lift to the subway, it ended up that Lee’s dad forgot about it and went up to the  BOAT , therefore we had to wait another 45 minutes for his dad to come home. In the meantime, Lisa’s friend Ashley came over and chilled with us for a bit, then Lisa and Zenon came back and the three of them went out for lunch. Finally, Lee’s dad came home with this red  MUSTANG  (  convertible  ); it was a very hot and fun car. On the way to the subway station, I remembered why I don’t like convertibles, because they messed up my hair. It was such a fun trip on the subway going down. When we arrived downtown, we walked to Robart’s Library for the T-Card; we had to wait for about 5 minutes for the photo to develop. I entertained myself by playing on the stair, but Lee kind of gave me a lecture about not playing on the stairs at a library, so I stopped. After that Ian had to use the ATM to get some money for food, so I once again entertained myself by playing hide and seek with myself, unexpectedly Lee sneaked up on me, and I shriek. LoL I caused such a raucous in a quiet university library. We quickly left the library shortly after. We walked around the engineering campus, after treading through a super damp and muddy field, I found myself on the same field where Nicole had graduated. Finally, I know where I was downtown. We went to Subway for lunch, then walked to the subway and headed back to Thornhill. The trip back was also very funny. Ian’s mom came by the subway station and gave us a lift home. When we got home, Lee and I watched Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights, after that we headed to Mac’s and got coke and  NERDS . ( Those little bits of candy in a carton with the different colours. ) Overall it was a very amusing and eventful day with Lee and Ian.      Friday:      After fellowship ended, a few of us ( Suki, Francis, Fion, Christie, Andes, and Me ) went to ET for bubble tea and food. It was fun just to talk and chill with some close friends. We spent so much time just talking about cartoons back in the days from Hong Kong, and many different interesting anime. LoL. That reminds me of Ben. So we stayed at the bubbles tea place till midnight, fun times.      Saturday:      Tim woke me up at 6 in the morning for Saturday morning cartoons; I am thinking to myself, cartoons don’t start till 7. As usual I went to pee then back to sleep I go. Tim waked me up again because he was heading out for swimming lessons, and he reminded me to watch Winx Club, which I did. Winx Club is so cool. Anyways, soon Lee came over to pick me up for lunch and stuff. We went to the Sushi place that Winnie told us about, where in each booth there was a button you can push for service, a super cool utility that all restaurants should possess. We had so much food from that place we waddled out of the restaurant like penguins. O yea, something super funny happened before we entered the restaurant. As we got out of the car, and walked towards the restaurant, there was a dog in a really nice car, being me I said, “Hi Doggy, don’t bark at me or else I’ll eat you.” As we walked closer to the restaurant, I realized that there was a lady sitting in the car with the dog, and she was just glaring at me. Omgosh, it was so funny. We called Ben during our meal to tell him about it, we laughed so hard together, and Ben was like, “That was crazy funny, props to you.” LoL. Yes, give myself a pat on the back. Afterwards, Lee and I headed back to his house and chilled for the rest of the evening. *Tubby Time was so much fun with Mr. Ducky and so relaxing with the Spa treatment.* We grabbed Wendy’s on the way back to my house. After arriving at my house and ate, we had such a deep conversation/argument about our foundation of believe and other things. I guess it was good for our relationship. But, I didn’t get to sleep till like 4 in the morning, and I woke up at 8 because I had to be usher for the English Service. I think I am smarter with less sleep.  I’ll write about today later, getting sleepy.
