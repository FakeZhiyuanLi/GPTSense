       From the Pool Reports    Ron Hutcheson of Knight Ridder reports to his colleagues about the trip back from the NATO dinner last night in Istanbul:  "Motorcade uneventful, but while we were waiting to leave, Turkish police escorting another motorcade ran over a stray puppy outside the palace. White House advanceman Chris Edwards tried to grab the dog, but it ran into the oncoming car. The dog ran off yelping and did not seem likely to survive."   Thanks to the Washington Post for the catch.

        'Come on down' ... literally  From Sydney Confidential 29jun04  WHEN recording an episode of The Price is Right on Friday, Larry Emdur told one of his contestants to "come on down."  Emdur didn't say "come on down, bang your noggin on the showcase wheel, bleed all over my set and then take an ambulance home."  But that's what happened.   Contestant Dean from Melbourne thought life couldn't get any better after being plucked from the audience, picking up $2500 and making it to the heady heights of spinning the $100,000 super showcase wheel.   That was until the handle of the wheel swung back and knocked Dean fair and square on the mush.   "Larry said to give the wheel a big spin and as I did the handle cracked me on the head," Dean recalled to Brisbane's 4BC radio yesterday.    "The wheel was heavy. It had concrete in it, I reckon."    Dean pressed on with the game until Emdur noticed there was blood running down his face.   "I was seeing stars for a while," he said.   "They took me out the back and tried to control the bleeding until the ambulance came.   "My wife finished playing for me."   Poor Dean's nasty head gash required five stitches.   The episode, to air this Friday, was re-recorded from the point of the incident with his wife Lynette in his place. Emdur simply tells viewers there had been "an accident".

        Cheney utters "F-word"  Thu 24 June, 2004 23:35    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney has blurted out the "F word" at Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont during a heated exchange on the Senate floor, according to congressional aides.  The incident occurred on Tuesday in a terse discussion between the two that touched on politics, religion and money, with Cheney finally telling Leahy to "f--- off" or "go f--- yourself," the aides said on Thursday.  "I think he was just having a bad day," Leahy was quoted as saying on CNN, which first reported the incident. "I was kind of shocked to hear that kind of language on the floor."  "That doesn't sound like language the vice president would use but there was a frank exchange of views," said Cheney spokesman Kevin Kellems.  According to congressional aides, Leahy said hello to Cheney following the taking of the Senate group photo on the floor of the chamber.  Cheney, who is president of the Senate, then ripped into Leahy for the Democratic senator's criticism this week of alleged war profiteering in Iraq by Halliburton, the oil services company that Cheney once ran.  Leahy and other Democrats have called for congressional hearings into whether the vice president helped the firm win lucrative contracts in Iraq after the U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam Hussein.  During their exchange, Leahy noted that Republicans had accused Democrats of being anti-Catholic because they are opposed to some of President George W. Bush's anti-abortion judges, the aides said.  That's when Cheney unloaded with the "F-bomb," aides said.  According to Senate rules, profanity is not permitted in the chamber. But when the exchange occurred between Leahy and Cheney, the Senate was not in session so there was technically no foul.

       Linguists have traced some of  urlLink Americans' favorite four-letter words  to the 11th century. Over the next 600 years, many other profane terms were incorporated into the lower-class vernacular of most languages. By 1785, an English scholar, Captain Francis Grose, had enough material to assemble a Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. According to Grose, "fusty luggs" referred to a "sluttish woman," and a man's sexual organ was known as a "plug tail." Women's breasts were variously referred to as "apple dumplin' shop" and "Cupid's kettle drums." An exclamation of surprise was "zounds!"; a foolish fellow a "nincumpoop."

         New Species of Underwater Bone-Eating Worm Found    Fri 30 July, 2004 04:34  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two new species of primitive worms that feed off the bones of dead whales have been discovered off the coast of California, scientists reported on Thursday.  The blind worms have no proper stomachs, but employ bacteria to help break down nutrients from the whalebones and feed them into rootlike organs, the U.S. and Australian researchers said.   The two new worm species are distantly related to worms found on underwater sea vents deep in the ocean and comprise their own new genus dubbed Osedax, which means "bone-devouring."   The scientists first found female tubeworms,  some as long as a person's index finger , rooted into the decaying remains of a young gray whale at the bottom of Monterey Bay, 9,100 feet (2,800 meter) deep off the coast of California.   The females have an outer tube, an inner muscular trunk, an egg-carrying oviduct and little docking points for the microscopic males, the researchers report in Friday's issue of the journal Science.   Females have red or red-and-white striped, feathery, gill-like structures called palps, which carry hemoglobin -- the stuff that makes blood red -- to capture oxygen from the water.  Marine biologist Greg Rouse of the South Australian Museum, and Shana Goffredi and Robert Vrijenhoek at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute said they were initially puzzled that they could only find females.   Then they looked closer and found the  microscopic males inside the females, living off yolk left over from their larval stages, yet full of sperm .   The females also were full of eggs.   "These worms appear to be  the ecological equivalent of dandelions  -- a weedy species that grows rapidly, makes lots of eggs, and disperses far and wide," Vrijenhoek said in a statement.  This would make sense, as worms adapted to live only on dead whales would die off after eating up the carcass. They would have to send enough eggs and sperm, or larvae, into the ocean void to ensure the survival of the species.   A look at the DNA of the two new species suggests they evolved about 42 million years ago, about the same time whales themselves first evolved, the researchers said.

(For breast enlargements, patients must supply their own implants.)   There is no limit on the number of cosmetic surgeries one soldier can have, although, Lyons said, “we don’t do extreme makeovers in the military.”

Carl had a few drinks, Debbie said, and started railing at the disk jockey, shouting, “I want to hear music about people blowing people’s brains out, cutting people’s throats!” Debbie continued, “I said, ‘Carl. Shut up.’ He said, ‘No, I want to hear music about shit I’ve seen!’” Carl listened to Debbie’s story with a loving smile, as though she were telling about him losing his car keys. “I don’t remember that,” he said, laughing. Debbie said, “That was the first time I heard him say stuff about seeing people’s brains blown out. Other times, he just has flashbacks—like, he sits still and stares.” Carl laughed again. “Really, though, I’m fine,” he said. Beside him in the booth, Debbie shook her head without taking her eyes from mine and exaggeratedly mouthed, “Not fine. Not fine.”

        urlLink Plus more!   &nbsp;  Including:  &nbsp;    After copulation, the female huddled in a corner of the shelter while her new shell hardened. In exchange, she left her old shell as a postcoital snack for the male. He began nibbling a few minutes after dismounting—the lobster equivalent, perhaps, of edible underwear.  The lobster reproduction model is wonderful. The males get into these big pissing contests—literally. They squirt urine in each other's faces while they fight to determine who's dominant. My friends often point out that it's not so different from certain aspects of human behavior. They'll say, "Oh yeah, I just saw two guys doing that in a bar the other day."  The females get to choose which male they want to mate with. Generally they seem to have a pretty strong preference for the dominant male. He's sitting there, pissing out the door of his house, waiting for females to walk by and smell how dominant and studly he is. The females have a sort of sisterhood, where they collaborate so that they all get a chance to mate with the dominant one. One female will move in with the dominant male for about two weeks, and then she'll move out and the next one will move in. Again, a lot of this is probably accomplished through sense of smell. The females smell each other's urine and the pheremones that they're giving off. They can tell if there's another female shacked up in there, and they'll wait around until that female is done.

       XXXXX DRUDGE REPORT XXXXX SUN JULY 11, 2004 09:44:08 ET XXXXX   TIME MAG INVESTIGATION REVEALS: EDWARDS LOVES 'DIET COKE'  The nation's top magazine leads the journalism pack on Monday with an in-depth investigation on the background of Dem VP pick John Edwards.   TIME magazine's Karen Tumulty has learned: John Edwards drinks Diet Coke -- a lot of Diet Coke!  TIME unearths: "The North Carolinian  who would be a caffeine-and-sodium-buzzed heartbeat away from the presidency subsequently admitted that 'on a good day' he has been known to open four before noon, at which point Kerry pronounced himself stunned, seized the can from Edwards and started reading the nutrition label aloud. 'Sodium,  2%. Protein, John, zero,' he called as Edwards scrambled for the door. As for himself, Kerry owned up: 'When I drink Coke, I have to drink the real thing, because of the sugar in it.'"  Not to be outdone by at least nine joint interviews Kerry and Edwards have conducted in the past few days with newspapers, news services and magazines, all embargoed for a Sunday release that would coincide with the pair's appearance on 60 MINUTES, editors at TIME snag the quote of the week:  "This man drinks a lot of Diet Coke," Kerry whispers to TIME, in its cover story set for maximum Monday impact.

        Boaters find kitten swimming 3 miles offshore in Gulf of Mexico         Associated Press  July 9, 2004, 9:37 AM EDT  ST. PETERSBURG -- When Maggie Rogers spotted something bobbing in the water three miles into the Gulf of Mexico while on a scalloping trip with friends, she assumed it was a turtle, or a piece of sea kelp.  But as the boat got closer and slowed down, she found it was a tiny, apricot-colored kitten. Nine inches long and screaming at the top of its lungs, the cat was paddling furiously.  ``We scooped him up and he sat on the boat with me for eight hours,'' said Rogers, who is the finance director at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.  ``He was exhausted and stressed,'' Rogers said. ``His heart rate was high.''  The boaters on the 17-foot Scout Current Drift did not know how the kitten arrived in the Homosassa Bay. There were at least 40 boats in the crowded area where he was found, they said.  On Tuesday, three days after he was found, a veterinarian found the 10-week-old, 1-pound kitten had worms, but was otherwise healthy.  He was adopted by Rogers' sister-in-law _ and named Nemo.

       The FBI released the below "indicators" of possible suicide bombers.  Unfortunately, they sound like nearly every tourist on the Mall for the 4th.  The FBI bulletin repeated for local authorities a previously released list of indicators often associated with suicide bomber attacks overseas. These include:  _ Irregular, loose-fitting  clothing not appropriate for warm weather, possibly with "protruding bulges or exposed wires" or a noticeable chemical odor.  _" Sweating , mumbling (prayers) or unusually calm and detached behavior." In addition, people who refuse to show their hands, possibly to conceal a detonator.  _Disguises, including military, police, medical or firefighter uniforms or someone posing as a  pregnant woman .  _Large or heavy baggage  not appropriate  for the location, such as a big duffel bag carried into a restaurant.  Law enforcement officials also were asked to be wary of possible terrorist surveillance, which the FBI said nearly always occurs prior to any attack "to determine suitability, security and probability of success."  Terrorists may also make anonymous threats to observe how security reacts and may attempt surveillance disguised as  homeless people, shoe shiners, street vendors  or street sweepers, the FBI said.

       BERLIN (Reuters) - Five frightened ducklings abandoned by their mother next to a busy German motorway were rescued when police ran after them and trapped them under traffic cones.   Drivers had called police to warn that a family of ducks was dangerously close to traffic on a highway in northern Germany.   "When the squad car arrived the mother duck fled across the railing of a bridge and into the Oker river and left behind five ducklings," police in the city of Braunschweig said in a statement Wednesday. After a zig-zag chase, the ducklings were reunited with their mother and swam away.
