      Well, it's almost that time of year again.  Time to start thinking about my appartment, and if I'm ready to invest in a more permanent home.  The idea of a house isn't something that interests me, however, a condo sounds more my speed.  Luckily, my sister is a real estate broker, so I don't have to worry about that part of it.  However, it's making the decision of which condos to look at?    A couple friends own condos up on the North-side, and I've pretty much lived on the North-side since moving here after college.  But, there's the lure of Broadripple ( urlLink think Monon Trail ) and  urlLink Eagle Creek Park  area.  UGH!!  I just can't decide.

      I think I'm addicted to shopping.  Sure, have a good laugh, but I love to go shopping.  I don't always have to buy something, but it's the attraction to new clothes.  I blame this addiction on the pound or two that I've lost.  Ok, closer to 80 lbs, but, my point is, I LOVE TO BUY NEW CLOTHES, and I am no longer restricted to buying Plus Size Clothes!    Now, there's another reason behind this shopping addiction, as is outlined very nicely by  Prof. Ruth Engs, RN, EdD, of the Indiana University, Department of Applied Health Science,  urlLink  she writes:    "Shopping and spending will not assure more love, bolster self-esteem, or heal the hurts, regrets, stress, and the problems of daily living."  Wow.. is that hitting the nail on the head, especially the part about love and self-esteem.   Because of various events in my life, such as divorce, a change of jobs, and failed friendships, I do spend a lot of time alone.  However, I'm really going to try and start connecting with people.  How am I going to do this, well, I have no clue yet, especially, because I do tend to be shy around new people.  So, if you have any suggestions, please let me know.  For starters, I'll use this blog to at least organize my thoughts, and try to start connecting with something or someone besides the mall.

      Today was a great day.  Earlier, I completed the Indianapolis Sprint Triathlon.  ( urlLink Click here for the full details of the Triathlon ) Then, I finally got to the theatre to see  urlLink Harry Potter .  (Loved the movie.. I can't wait for the next one)  Saw the  urlLink Spiderman 2 trailer  It looks great!!!    Finally, as a reward for all my hard work at training for the Triathlon, I went to a restaurant for a well deserved pizza dinner.  Imagine my surprise to see a clown there performing.    What a great day!!!

      Saturday the 26th, is the Indianapolis Sprint Triathlon.  Last year I was to participate in this event, but if you remember, just a couple weeks before the event I severely injured my ankle.  Well, my ankle is all healed, and I've been training like crazy.  I'm so excited.. I just can't wait!    If you're interested in the event, you can learn more at the  urlLink Tuxedo Brothers  Website.    The event consists of a 500 Meter Swim, 10 Mile Bike, 3 Mile Run.

      Yesterday at work, some co-workers rescued an abandoned kitty.  They brought him into work, and he was immediately adopted by a fellow co-worker.  Now named "Yugi", he went to the vet last night, and is adjusting well to his new home.  He has lots of food and water and a happy home.  Sometimes, things just work out well, and make you smile!

      Welcome to Kitty Purr!  What's with the name you ask?  Well, I wanted something original and something that would make me smile...and I just love the sound of a kitty cat purring. So, KittyPurr seemed like an obvious choice.

      Rather than waiting until year-end, I thought I'd come up with a list of goals to work on thru the rest of the year.  Here we go:  1.  Quit trying to give-up Diet Coke.  I'm just going to accept that I need my diet cokes.    2.  Quit being nice to people who truly do not deserve my kindness.    3.  Meet the weight loss goal that Monica set for me by year end.    4.  Enjoy time spent with friends and family, without worrying about other things/chores that need done.  Just relax a little.    5.  more to come soon.....

      Yes, I can cook, and quite well I've been told, it's just that I don't seem to enjoy it like some of my friends and family do.  However, to recognize each of them for all their hard work, I am providing you with this list of some of my favorite foods often prepared by family and friends.       Mom (Sandy)  - The Next Best Thing to Robert Redford, Potato Salad, and Lasagna   Sister (Debbie) - Enchiladas and Sweedish Meatballs   Grandma Opal - Baked Spaghetti (with Bacon) and Ham &amp; Beans with Cornbread    Grandma Izzy - Homemade Noodles     Aunt Judi - Peanut Butter Fudge and Chocolate Covered Pretzles    Shelly (Cousin) - Italian Sausage Lasagna    Julie - Spinach Pizza (even the crust is homemade) and Chocolate Brownies    Monica - Couscous and Black Bean Roll-ups   Erin - Chicken Parmesan and Stuffed Mushrooms   Ex-boyfriends (to remain nameless) - Kugel and Pierogi's    If I neglected to include your speciality, let me know :-)  Also, if you feel like cooking me a meal.. let me know!   LOL

      Do you ever wonder what your cat might be thinking? Well, Bob The Ocicat, has his own blog. It's filled with insights into his curious kitty mind. Check it out at   urlLink http://bob_the_ocicat.blogspot.com/    urlLink Bogie  visits the blog regularly, and thought of creating a blog on his own.  However, he realized it might drastically cut into his napping time.

       Over the weekend, I volunteered at a triathlon organized by  urlLink Tuxedo Brothers .  Why did I volunteer instead of participate?  Well, a minor back injury slowed me down for a couple weeks, and I decided it was time for me to start giving back to society, and this was the first thing I could think of doing as a volunteer.  The event was tons o' fun and  I met some very nice people and cheered on the participants.      In case you haven't heard the other big news, I'm starting a new job on July 26th.  I'm certainly going to miss having fun at work with  urlLink Matt ,  urlLink Seth , and  urlLink Henrik .  While the lure of a new job is exciting, I'll be honest and say that it's a little intimidating to start over again.      Finally, I solemnly pledge that before the end of the month, I'm going to make a quick stop at the car wash and vacuum out my little   urlLink  Corolla   .  The floor has gotten a tad bit dirty.. and she just isn't happy.

      Lately, on my drives to work or to the mall, I've noticed a few strange things happening.  For example, on monrning on my way to work, I noticed a gentleman in a  urlLink red convertible  moving around his car as if struggling to get comfortable.  It turns out, he was reaching down to put on his socks.  Luckily this was at a rather llloooonnnnngggg stoplight on the northside, so he had plenty of time to finish his task.  This morning, at my favorite bagel shop,  urlLink Einstein Bros  I noticed that the driver in the parking spot next to me was painting her fingernails.  Luckily the car was parked, so no harm-no foul.   Wonder what I'll spot next???

      It's the family curse.  As a kid, I remember how my mom's  urlLink Sciatic Nerve  would ache after some type of "incident". By incident, I mean a car wreck, a slip on the ice, moving something very heavy, etc.  Sometimes she'd need medical treatment but most of the time she would "tough" it out.    Well, in my over over-zealousness to workout and get in better shape, I've aggrivated my Sciatic nerve.  During a cool down after a tough 1 hour class, I was doing a  urlLink Cobra Yoga Pose .  It's a very simple move, and as you follow the link above, you'll see that it clearly states " Yoga exercise has no competition element".  Of course, during class, I was thinking....Wow.. I am so much more flexible than everyone else.  Woo Hoo.. I ROCK!    It has now been a couple days since the class, and my lower back is very sore.  I'm icing my back, elevating my legs, and taking ibuprofen.  The next time I'm in class, I'm not going to look around and see if I can stretch further than the others.  I need to listen to Monica (follow the workouts she's given me, and keep my food journal) and I'll succeed at losing the last 30lbs that I'm aiming to loose by year end.  Trying to "out-do" others isn't the way....

      Ahhh.. movie quotes.    After taking a very quick poll, I've learned that my friends like:   Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in. Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. Get busy living....or get busy dying.    What's your favorite movie quote???

      Yesterday, was the  urlLink Cicero Triathlon .  Unfortunately due to an algae issue in the water, the swim portion of the event was replaced by a 1.7 mile run.  Now, as many of you know, I'm a great swimmer, so I was sad to learn that the swim portion wouldn't take place.   I started out with a nice paced jog and finished the initial run all the while wishing we had been swimming.  Then it was onto the cycling portion, which I consider my second strongest portion, with swimming being my first.  I caught many of those speedy runners during the cycling portion, only to be passed by them again during the final 3 mile run.   While the day was a little disapointing becasue I didn't finish as well as I would have had the swim portion taken place, I am proud of myself for "toughing" it out and finishing strong.   I'm certainly looking forward to next years event... Bring on the Swim!!!!  :-)

      Recently, I picked up a copy of a magazine and noticed an article about a Pathalogical Giver. That's right, someone who gives and gives and gives. The article, in  urlLink Real Simple  magazine, told the story of a woman who was always giving, in the hopes that people would like her in return.  I noticed some strong similarities between this woman and myself. I realize that in the past, I've gone out of my way to be nice to people and/or do things for them in the hopes that they would like me or "include" me in their lives. AND... this isn't the first I've noticed this trait in myself, as is evidenced by my mid-years resolutions.  I'm tired of trying to get people to like me! If you like me, GREAT... You'll see that I'm a wonderful person. If you don't like me..... well, it's your loss!   :-)
