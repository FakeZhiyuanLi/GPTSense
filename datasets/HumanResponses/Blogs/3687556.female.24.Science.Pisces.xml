      So I decided to do this blog as a keep up to what is going on in my life for those whom I do not get to talk to as much as I would like.  Daniel Rah first introduced me to this site...we will see how this goes.  Life here is very hectic between research, ORP, friends and church.  Tomorrow I am teaching the 2's and 3's in church and then going straight over to the 1st graders.  So church is going to be interesting (even more than normal)!  Softball practice is at 4pm tomorrow and then off to Kelley's and Brent's for bible study.  Some day off huh.    Today I came into lab and a couple of experiments ended up not working seeing how one compound keeps crashing out of solution when I inject it into buffer so... those experiments are done for.  Tonight I may go out with Rene and Tim to a movie but most importantly I need to go to the grocery store for more vegs and bread for the week.  (For those who know about this and well now everyone knows...improving my health is going well).  I joined a Flex n' Tone class at the Rolfs (school gym).  Very fun...Becky joins me and I think Kelley might come with us too.  The class is every Tuesday and Thursday.  Other days are filled with softball and the elipical machine.  (Hey it gets me out of lab and its free...what more can you ask for.)  So hopefully I will be able to keep this up.  I have always wanted a diary and this may improve my spelling and writing style.    Looking forward to the future,  Kristy

      Yes Daniel, the conference has been fun...but not as fun as a listening to a transistor speaker...   The conference has been going really well...&nbsp; Sunday started off with a bang and Monday followed with interesting talks and good company (Marty and Tim came along).&nbsp; I hear a wonderful talk on microcompartmentalization.&nbsp; I ended up getting up the courage to talk to her about her research and she offered me a postdoc position...actually she said to contact her about a yr from when I was ready to graduate that way she would make sure she had money to fund me.&nbsp; The only thing is that she is at Penn State...I was kinda wanting to go somewhere really fun...like Australia, CA or England for a postdoc but, the research will make it all the worth while.&nbsp; I ended up talking to her again today about canoeing and she wanted to make sure that I contact her when I am closer to graduating.&nbsp;  Canoeing went well today.&nbsp; I shipped 60 supramolecular chemists down the river and none of them fell in.&nbsp; Everyone had a blast...the main complaint was that it was too short but we decided to have a cookout afterwards and that made up for it.&nbsp; As a group we went through 9 cases of beer!&nbsp; At one point the ranger came over and asked if I had known that there was no glass allowed in the park.&nbsp; With everyone staring and complete silence I told him I didn't know and what did I have to do to rectify the situation.&nbsp; He told me that the beer would have to be poured in the plastic cups and the bottles thrown right out.&nbsp; Everyone jumped up and changed there beer over.&nbsp; A couple of the professors came up to me and told me that I handled the situation very well and everything was planned perfectly and running smoothly.&nbsp; I had a ton of fun and being on the lake today really helped my nerves.&nbsp;  I get to catsit Dexter and Shadow next week...I can't wait.&nbsp; Dr. Smith has my talk slides and I will find out soon what he thought of them.&nbsp;  I have decided to buy a suit for my upcoming presentations...I think it would be a good purchase.&nbsp; I just purchased my airplane ticket for Mass.&nbsp;I can't wait to go...

      Hey all,  The weekend is over...kinda sad...yet not.&nbsp; It has been busy.&nbsp;  Friday after group meeting I left to go to Kelley and Brent's were we had a college class cookout...I had fun.&nbsp; We played waffle ball and chilled out.&nbsp; That night I left early and went go pick up a polish girl at a bus stop and take her to&nbsp;a hotel before the conference started.&nbsp; She however never showed.&nbsp; I ended up talking to her today and found out that she ended up missing the first two buses because she was at the wrong bus terminal in Chicago and came here at 1 am last night.&nbsp;  Saturday started off interesting.&nbsp; I made it to Niles, MI (15 minutes away) and walked in the Relay for Life.&nbsp; Next year I hope it is better organized and more of our team shows up.&nbsp; I ended up alone walking around a track for 2 hours then Tiff and Jeff showed up.&nbsp; I was suppose to walk for an hour more but I was talking to Tiff and ended up getting side tracked.&nbsp; 2 hours later I left because I had to make cheesey potatoes to bring for a softball cookout.&nbsp; I got home after grocery shopping and had just enough time to take a shower and make the potatoes.&nbsp; I have realized that in the north everything seems to start on time and when someone says a function starts at 4:30, they mean 4:30.&nbsp; I never realized this in the south.&nbsp; I guess we just aren't as punctual.&nbsp; I got really sunburnt from the walk and am a bright red.&nbsp; The cookout was fun and we watched our last game.&nbsp; We played a boardgame and it was really fun.&nbsp; We all really enjoyed ourselves.&nbsp; Tom gave out awards to everyone and mine was the Purple Heart...and knee and leg Award...for always getting hurt.&nbsp;  Sunday I left for church and ended up giving a friend's mom a ride home because she wasn't able to get to her son (my friend) in time to grab a ride.&nbsp; She is really nice so it was a pleasent little ride.&nbsp; After that I went out to eat for Sunday lunch and then off to the conference.&nbsp; I brought my computer for nothing.&nbsp; I went to a NSF workshop for Membrane Transport and another for Interlocking Molecules.&nbsp; Both were really informative and very interesting (I didn't fall asleep once).&nbsp; Dr. Leigh (one of the top rotaxane chemists in the world) was the speaker for the Interlocking Molecules workshop did majic tricks throughout the talk (2 hrs).&nbsp; Turns out that one of his hobbies is majic and he loves to have fun.&nbsp; very nice guy...&nbsp; I ended up seeing Tim and Yoshi (two former postdocs).&nbsp; Yoshi's wife is pregnant and they are having a boy and Tim is having fun in NM.&nbsp; It was like a Smith group reunion.&nbsp; We all had dinner together and got to catch up...it was really fun.&nbsp;

      Hey all!!   So VBS finished yesterday without a hitch....all went as well as can be expected.&nbsp; I understand your pain Lisa (she went through VBS this past week also).&nbsp; I think I like the little kids though better than 4/5 graders.&nbsp; Although I don't mind shepherding for them and hey, I will take what Sonia gives me!&nbsp; Sonia asked me last night about my schedule for the fall and it looks like I will be continuing with the 3rd Sunday- teaching 2/3 yr olds and the first Wed. of every month babysitting for 2 hours.&nbsp; All in all it is really fun...they grow up so fast.&nbsp; The 200 kids raised over 1400 bucks for a missionary in Hungry.&nbsp; Amazing how much they have in there little piggy banks.&nbsp; Steve told them to say this when they got hungry, "Mom, I'm hungry, I need some money to take to VBS for Hungry."&nbsp; When each color got to there goal, 125 bucks, they got a 100 grand candy bar.&nbsp;  It is amazing though how many parents don't even remember you.&nbsp; I had a parent come up to me the other day (I babysit her kids on Wednesday nights and it just so happens that she also is a helper with the college class) and say, "Hi, I don't think we have met."&nbsp; I said actually we have...I babysit your child every so often on Wed. nights...needless to say she was shocked that she never recognized me and now on Wed. she always says hi.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I found out that we ranked 5th in soccer (out of 9 I think) and 12/13 in softball.&nbsp;   Now that all the sports has ended we don't have anything to practice for on Sundays.&nbsp; We are going to continue having some sort of sport during our practice time.&nbsp; I know I have, and a bunch others, really look forward to playing some sort of sport then.&nbsp;   Ok, I think that is all...I will write again to update you all on the weekend!

      So as many of you know VBS was this week and so far it has gone pretty well.&nbsp; originally I thought that the conference and VBS was going to overlap but it turns out it didn't.&nbsp; On Monday we played our final game and did pretty well, we scored 3 against the number 2 team so I was happy.&nbsp; My goal is to at least hit the ball every time I get up...making it to first will be next years goal.&nbsp; Last night a huge, strong T-storm moved through...its the kinda storm where you want to make tea and sit and watch the storm, but instead I was with a bunch of little kids...now this isn't a bad thing just the crying was a little much.&nbsp; When all the lights went out all of us were kinda shocked.&nbsp; At first all of them thought it was cool, but then my partner (I think he is a freshmen) cried out and&nbsp;I followed with a swift kick in the back and whispering..."what are you doing?&nbsp; there are little kids in&nbsp;here!"&nbsp; he said he was sorry...&nbsp; We sang a bunch of songs for an hour (I'm really starting to like "Baby shark") and then we went around to 3 different stations where we were hurdled next to the windows for light.&nbsp; It wasn't quite that bad, everyone had fun, except for one kid in my group.&nbsp; Tonight is the last night of VBS...the parents are getting there at 8 to see all there children do the motions to all the songs we have been doing&nbsp;each night.&nbsp; Later tonight the college class is meeting for dinner at Chili's (we don't normally get dinner before VBS).&nbsp;   Life is going on as normal, however a big t-storm is moving though right now and&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;its gone before I have to leave for VBS.   This weekend is a busy one...a cookout tomorrow night at Brent and Kelley's with the college class.&nbsp; Saturday I am walking in the Relay for&nbsp;Life and that night I am going to another cookout (where I will be bringing those potatoes that&nbsp;Kelley made and that Jamie gave me her recipe for, my family loves them) at Mike and Ashley's for the softball team.&nbsp; Sunday is full of church and sports. &nbsp;   Soon I hope to have a new computer.&nbsp; I am applying for a student loan to get it.&nbsp; I have it all picked out- 14 in Apple, 1.2 GHz processor, superdrive, 60 GB, 234 ram, airport card preinstalled, laptop.&nbsp; It will be an expessive purchase but it will be worth it.&nbsp; I hope that it will be able to take me through my doctorate and into a postdoc or a real job.&nbsp; I decided to mac it out (no puns intended) because I am a slight pack rat...hey I still have a twin bed because I can't see throwing a perfectly good bed away and I don't want to sell it to anyone here.&nbsp; My old computer I will be leaving at home and can play around on it there (MP3 player usage, DVD collection update and playing Oregon trail (I want to get the new model of the game)).&nbsp;   Bye!

      So my&nbsp; weekend started off on Thursday with a call to my boss with at 3:30 when I got up (I worked a nighttime shift) to find out that 2 of the members of my group had to leave early on Friday and Smith wanted me to give my presentation on Friday at 10 am.&nbsp; So this normally won't have been a big deal however: a) I had been working nights so 10 is my 2 am and b) I hadn't even worked on the presentation because I have been concentrating all of my work on another project and I figured I had all night Thursday as well as a couple of hours on Friday to get it done.&nbsp; So I got the presentation done, luckily, and presented it on Friday after downloading it on the computer I was going to give it on and realizing that that was the previous presentation and I had to run upstairs start my computer and download it again...I don't think Smith was happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I completed it...all is well.&nbsp; The rest of that day though was unproductive...I sent it talking to Kelley about books and movies...(I heard Lonely Bones is a good book) and going to happy hour at 5:05 where I was able to have dinner- 2 hotdogs and some nachos with my diet coke (ROH slows down the metabolism).&nbsp; That night Don, Tim and I hit the dollar theatre to see "The Chronicles of Riddick" which turns out to be an ok movie and I was happy to only pay 2 bucks to see it.&nbsp; After that Don and I went and grabbed ice cream at Coldstone and were able to catch up.  Saturday went ok, Rene called around 11 and we left and went shopping.&nbsp; When we were at Dick's&nbsp;I found the perfect shirt for my canoe outing ( in case you were wondering I am in charge of shipping 75 supermolecular chemists and there families down the St. Joe river at one time in 12 days--I can't wait).&nbsp; On the front of the shirt it says, "Take me to the River" with a little stick figure carrying a canoe...very cute and perfect for that day.&nbsp; Then we ended up going to the bookstore so Rene could get a shirt for her day for his birthday however they didn't have any good ones.&nbsp; I ended up getting "the Shirt" for the football season and I think Tim got a hat.&nbsp; We then headed off to lunch and they dropped me off at my apartment so I could go to the gym (it closes at 3 on Saturdays--a crying shame).&nbsp; After the gym I called my parents and while talking to them I did my grocery shopping.&nbsp; Rene, Tim and I &nbsp;saw "I, Robot" that night...very good movie.&nbsp; Regarding the fireworks that were suppose to happen that night they got postponed for 2 weeks.  Sunday was seeded with teaching 2/3 yr olds, Sunday school, our weekly lunch out, softball and the start of VBS.&nbsp; Other than that though pretty uneventful.&nbsp;  Today starts another work week.&nbsp; Our lab will be shut down for next week- ISSC conference that we (my group) are hosting so no major work can really get done.&nbsp; This might be good in that this time can be spent on finishing up last experiments, preparing for my upcoming conferences and ORP time.&nbsp; yeah.&nbsp; Tonight however we are playing in a playoff softball game.&nbsp; Even though we hadn't won a game we still ranked 12/13.&nbsp; This should be interesting...  &nbsp;

      So I have a new addiction- Internet games.  You see...while I monitor flourence I have a minute between runs so I have nothing to do.  Spider solitaire used to fill the time but I always get frustrated on any level other than easy so I have been playing internet spades and internet checkers...wow, am I bad a checkers.  The games are fun because they are automatically logged in through the computer and you can only select certain phrases to chat like "good jump, hello, or play again?"  Really fun...  I don't think I have made this clear so I just wanted to point this out--I really enjoy reading other peoples blogs...it lets me feel like I have something to look forward to when coming to work (I know I am that pathetic).  And I like feeling like I am involved with my friends lives. (Lisa- you need to update yours and Susan, you should get one of these blogs!!) For everyone else-Susan is a big internet person and knows a ton about internet stuff and making slideshows (hint hint Susan :) ).    On another note... I think I am going to go see Romeo and Juliet alone this year.  My theatre partner is somewhere in Quito (VERY cute postcard by the way!)  I got two new CD's the other day- "The complete Greatest Hits of Gordon Lightfoot" and "The Essential Hits of Mary Chapin Carpenter"-I have been in a 70's folk music mood lately.    A group in my department is having a big fireworks outing on Saturday.  I was going to go and watch the fireworks and chill.  It sounds really fun and I am looking forward to it.

      The wedding was beautiful...I must have cried at least 3 times, one when I saw Chris come in, one when I saw Becky and another at the very end when they were leaving.  I can't wait to see if Becky and Chris liked what I got them...a leather bound book of a Harry Potter book in the English (i.e. not American) version.  They left for a cruise for a week on Sunday.  After getting up early and driving 7 hours to get back home I went to softball practice...which normally puts me in a good mood, however after being smacked in the leg with a ball that was just hit changed that mood.  So there I was hobbling along, trying not to cry ("gotta be a man") when I just gave up and left practice.  The weirdest thing though was looking down and seeing 2 lumps where the ball's impact had separated my leg fat and muscle...yeah its big and blue/black with red in the middle 6 in circle on the front of my leg which hurts and shaving is interesting.  I can't where pants...that hurts the bruise.  And what really gets me is I might not be able to play in Wed soccer game against our other team because if I get hit in the leg, which in soccer happens frequently, I might kill someone due to the pain I will be in.  My car ended up not needing breaks according the guy at the mechanic shop so...dad will have to check them out for me when I see him in Sept.  Today...has been one of those days...I don't know if I told you but I am presenting a poster in Aug and in Sept at different conferences...but same basic concept.  The conference in Aug is with the Walther Cancer Research Center here at ND and since my work used to be funded by the center we decided to show support and I would give a poster (my work is now funded by a 1 M $ NIH grant).  Well I was automatically entered into a contest when I entered and I found out today I won...this is not good...now to any other grad student they would be thrilled.  A 2nd year grad student being elected to give a 15 min presentation with 5 min of questions in front of about 200 of there peers and advisors would be thrilled, this is a very good sign.  I however am petrified...I don't do public speaking. So when I got this email my first reaction was horror and running into my bosses office saying holy crap...I can't do this. And him telling me...oh yes you are and congrats...Ahh the pressure and fun of grad school.    And the other conference I won a 500 dollar travel award to Woods Hole Mass (its not on the map).  But I am looking forward to it.  I haven't been to Mass and can't wait to have some seafood and see the beach!  And since I won't have to use any of my grant money...I can save it up for Corsica, France...or California (Biophysical Meeting).  So to any those out there who would like to pray for me...please pray for my leg and my upcoming presentation.    Now I just gotta figure out what to wear!!  Oh yeah, a suit maybe?? That does make me a little excited...  I just finished "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown and must say it was the best book I have ever read...it deals with God and science with a fiction twist of mystery and history...it was great!!!  There was this one quote on pg 110 that basically said:  Science tells me that there is a God.  My mind tells me that I don't understand Him. But my heart tells me that I am not suppose to.  wow...very good and inspiring.  I would love to get into a conversation one day with someone about science and God.  To those who don't believe in God...I will lend you my Biochemistry book...trust me...after you read that thing you will believe.  I can't wait to read another one of his books.  I am however going to start Contact by Carl Segar (Sp?).  Ken tells me it is much better than the movie (and I thought the movie was excellent: my favorite quote: Wow, if we are the only ones here (referring to the galaxy) that sure is a big waste of space.)

      So I found out that we have one more game on either Monday or Tuesday with a soccer game on Wednesday...this should be interesting.  I leave tomorrow for Kentucky for 3 days.  Hopefully I will be back in time on Sunday for softball practice and bible study at 7.  Tomorrow should be interesting because I want to do laundry, take my car to get the breaks fixed, get cash, do the dishes, take the garbage out, clean my apartment, pack and work out prior to leaving at 1:30ish for Kentucky.  Have I mentioned that I will be leaving work at 6ish am.  I will be sleeping in the car...that is for sure.  I have decided that I have a new favorite song.  Its called "You get me" by Zoegirl.  Its taken a lot to change my last favorite song...I am a little opposed to change but I am becoming more open to it as I get older.  I have figured out that change is good just in moderation.    I have found that blog means weB LOG...I didn't know that but that's what one of Lisa's friends.    Hope all is well with everyone...

      We lost at both but had fun!  I caught a ball that was tipped in softball which means they were out!!  Everyone cheered.  My voice hurts though...hmmm maybe because of all the yelling.  Soccer was interesting...lets just say that first impressions are important when sizing up a team.  I have come to the conclusion that all foreigners love and know how to play soccer.  We got stompled.  We actually scored 3 but they say we scored one which is nonsense.  One I saw go over the line which should have counted.  The other goal had attached to it a ruffing call which came from the same guy who tripped me (don't worry I took him down with me)...yes a person on our team did get into a verbal fight with the guy which involved my name...it was interesting.  Softball is done with but soccer prevails...our next game is against the other Chem team...so it should be fun.

      Ok, so obviously I am not very good at sticking to things...but...give me a break man!!  Life here is going on as normal.  Becky and Chris's wedding is this weekend so on Friday I will be leaving (and hopefully dropping off my car to get worked on) for Kentucky.  Don't worry mom I got the Cheese-its. 4th of July was good, went to church then to a picnic. Around 7 a bunch of us went out to eat and then to go see some fireworks.  They were good for the 5 bucks we paid for the car.   Monday Rene and I went for a 20 mile bike ride in MI at Kal-Haven state park.  Beautiful day, but I got eaten up with bites and my butt hurts from the seat.   James is doing well.  As perky as normal.   I haven't talked to Susan in a while...if you read this...email me.     Tonight is a double header- softball at 5:15 then indoor soccer at 6:15. One person just pulled out so we are down to exactly 4 people and I have to be at softball (I'm the catcher...it puts my vocal cords to good work.)   I am excited because (and don't laugh) I got 3 new jelly's to eat with my peanut butter sandwiches (apricot and strawberry were getting old)- blackberry, red raspberry and grape!! I had the blackberry today-good, but needed more flavor.  Oh, and I got these really small grapes...they are so cute...I just had to buy them to eat!  On to school: I have been working nights (so this is why Jamie got a phone call at her 1 am my 3 am last night).  Very quite in lab, that is until I pump up the music and I start singing alone. Actually very fun!!  I won a travel grant to visit Woods Hole Mass in September and to give a poster.  I just found out I am giving another poster on in early Aug.  Research presentation is coming up next Friday...yeah fun. Smith just put me on another project...which he wants done yesterday so...  Kristy's thought of the day (yes only one per day and you just got it so be thankful)-  Have you drunk enough dihydrogen monoxide today?  gotta get to work!!  Bye!

      So this week has turned out to be an even more boring week. I have been able to spice things up a bit by adding in Girls Night Out tonight (dinner at Hana Yori- Japanese steak house and then to see Princess Diaries 2) and a movie visit from Daniel last night (all other people were invited but no one wanted to come, Daniel...I don't think we make good company) and working out with Becky which has turned out to be fun and inspiring. This weekend will be crazy...I am proctoring the MCAT (200 bucks yeah- football tickets here I come) and Saturday night I am going to watch fireworks. Sunday will be busy with church and hopefully a sport outing (maybe softball...soccer??). The lab has been quite...relatively (the fan has been blowing really loudly due to our compressor being shot with the hoods being open). The weather here has been really crappy...yesterday after storming all day the temp dropped to 60s. It is suppose to be like that all today and tomorrow with scattered rain...what happened to summer?  It got hot for 3 days and then dropped again!

      Hey all,  Well I gave my talk...my goal was to leave the stage and not feel like a stumbling fool. I was happy in that I did just that. I won 5th place and took home honorable mention. It was kinda cool because they gave me a framed award so that will go up in my bedroom with my other degrees and article that was written about me in the Sanford Harold. Other than that, life here is interesting, yet boring all at the same time. I am juggling a couple of different projects and trying to keep sane which in and of itself is interesting. This week is going to be a busy one with meetings and such. I have decided thought to start helping out with AWANA at church. It is a kids program on Wednesday nights and I will be helping out the 2-4 year olds. I will tell you more about that later. Girls night out is on Wednesday night- we are going to Hana Yori for dinner then to see Princess Diaries 2. Can't wait...should be a good movie.

      I keep forgetting to tell this story...  So in Paris, we all (Delphine, Jamie, Rene, Susan and I) went to visit Notre Dame Cathedral. We decided to take a look and hike up one of the bell towers and subsequently waited in an hour line (it was very cold that day too!) Once paying for our entrench we climbed the stairs up a little way and came to a gift store (yes in the bell tower) and then left to walk along one of the edges of the cathedral and take pictures. We then went to see the bell. Now this is when things got really interesting...Susan and I took some pics of us with the bell and then I decided to leave so I thought we were suppose to go back down the same way we came up because I thought the tour was done. When I got all the way down however I got the feeling that I was completely wrong and I had gone the wrong way. So I did like I was taught in Girl Scouts and picked a spot in front of the Cathedral and sat down waiting for them. There was a band and a bunch of people singing in the back ground...they were having some sort of festival there that day. Luckily I have the gene from my mom that likes people watching.  All of a sudden I realize that I am humming a long to the tune and singing to the song...I realize that it was one of the songs from church! I listened to the words and hence found that the words were in French but I did know the tune. Eventually I did find the group and we went off to tour the inside of the church...

      Well the conference has ended...the canoeing trip went well...everyone was happy and had a wonderful time...someone actually told me that they had the best time at the outing as compared to any other outing from a conference! I learned a bunch and spent all day Friday driving people to and from the airport...in my car...in my gas that I was so happy to get just prior to the 20 cents jump. Dr. Smith says he wants to go somewhere in the next couple of weeks to celebrate the conference running smoothly. One extra bit of happiness, can anyone sense the sarcasm, is I have an added visitor that showed up and is requesting that I teach him a couple of assays this week...I however have many other plans for this week and he is not top of my list...will see how this week goes due to his untimely visit. Yesterday Rene and I drove to Mich. City where I bought a suit and shoes. I think in all I ended up saving about 150 due to sales and a 20% coupon that the sales lady gave me at Jones of New York. Hopefully I will look very spiffy for my presentation on Saturday. Today I had lunch with Chris and Becky. I recommend the grilled chicken salad with parmesan peppercorn dressing at Logans. For dinner my church held a ministry cookout for anyone who helps out with the ministry...i.e. thats me. We had hotdogs and chips and watched Finding Nemo outside on the lawn on a big screen. It was lots of fun!
