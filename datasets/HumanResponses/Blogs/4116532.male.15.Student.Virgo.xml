      Happy Birthday to my nephew, who has just turned 5 yesterday :), on the 18th. Yesterday we have spend all day long outside in a mall, which was pretty fun, I have played some Billiard, ate in a good resturant and had fun, which really helps me out. Tommorow I am coming back home, and I still have to finish my home asignment in math, which is due to the 25th...and I still have 40± problems to solve. Lets hope for better, and my sister should give birth to a baby boy (hopefuly before friday) so I could see him, ah, an uncle for two :).  I really feel like I have done the most of my holiday. See you all in two days time..or more :)

      On friday, I went back home for 2 days, everything was good. Visited my parents, my cousions, my grand'ma and all was well, even tho my Dad didn't feel well, but atleast now he feels better.  On saturday, we went to IKEA with my cousions, and it was fun, I've seen my cousion who really changed and became a HipHop fan and dresses like one. we had our fun there but when we came to the registers...a line of 2 hours...after that, back to my sister's  Today, it started ok, went to my sister's husband's working place, but everything went wrong we went to pick up my nephew from his grand'ma. He said some things a son should never say to a father. At home everything went from bad to worse, my sister had a fight with her husband, it quieted down but things turned to be even worse later that day, and now she wont stop crying... why can't things stay all well forever? and plus on that, now my nephew won't let me sit near the computer, almost..because if I ask to sit, he crys to his mom and she tells me to back off.  :(

      Have you ever noticed that if you are not thin people will treat you diffrently? Like two days ago when I was in Herzelya in that mall, my nephew wanted a Mc's meal so we were standing in line and some guy, which I have never seen comes to me, hits me on the shoulder and says "Hey, don't you think you are fat enough?" and then appolagised saying he thought I was someone else...YEAH like that is comforoting, you still said that I am fat :(, which I am not...I am just a little bit full.  Sure I am no super star, with muscles in his belly, or have a charming personallity, and surly my glasses can even top why people don't think I am prince charming. So SURE I am full, have glasses, don't have the self-confidence of a star but I am still a person, with feelings, you can't just come over to me and insult me...like it's not enough that I feel that way, you need to come over to me and tell me that infront of 40 people? Thats really low...really low...

      Yesterday I went to the Marine in Herzelya and oh boy what strange people there are these days. First there was a photographer that kept taking shots of 2 girls on a lion statue for over 2 hours, then we went inside the mall and somewhere in the end of our "trip" in the mall a group of people, prolly 3 couples, 2 moms and 2 dads + there new wedded (or not) kids, the woman was pregnant, then for no reason one of the mothers came by to my sister (did i forget to mention i am sleeping over the summer @ my sister's? :P) who's 9th month pregnat and start chatting about her belly with her, then the pregnat woman comes and the mother wanted to compare who had a bigger belly, OH COME ON! - buh but that was yesterday :/  Today I went to a public sale in Tel-Aviv, no reason just to see what's there; after looking I sat down with my sister to hear what they were offering, somewhere about 10 minutes of sitting my nephew heard that the man said he was offering a DVD with an opening price of 1 NIS (about 25¢) so my nephew shouted "1 NIS"! and that old hag had the rudeness of insulting my nephew and said he'll slap him >:/.  After that we went to the beach in Tel-Aviv just to walk abit but my sister had a fight with her husbad in the car, for no reason :/. When we were walking on the beach my nephew started running forward and then stopping sharply and I told him not to and my sister, which is looking for a reason to have a fight with me and everybody else startes shouting at me and got angry at me too.  I hope everything will be better tommrow and for the next two weeks while I am here.
